Senior Izzy Parilis was glued to her Twitter feed and local news stations Monday, bracing for Hurricane Sandy to leave her D.C. backyard in shambles.
But as the winds died down, she quickly realized that the area’s northern neighbors would take the storm’s toughest blow and began to coordinate a trip up the East Coast to aid recovery efforts.
Dozens of students from the community service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega will drive to New York and New Jersey – two of the University’s largest feeder states – next week to clear away debris in communities battered by the storm. Some estimates pegged property damages at $20 billion.
“My immediate reaction was to look at the District and see what’s going on around here. But the greatest need is in New York and New Jersey,” Parilis said. “One of the biggest things people don’t understand is trash doesn’t move itself.”
Parilis, the organization’s president and a New Jersey native, said she felt “responsible” to help pitch in. She added that since a large percent of students hail from the tri-state area, students will be even more likely to get involved in the relief efforts. Her home lost power during the storm, but did not suffer major damages.
Many of the members, including Parilis, have also participated in cleanup work after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. The students in the group often volunteer as part of the University’s Freshman Day of Service and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service, and also go on alternative break trips.
Junior and APO member Alex Immekus said he is planning a trip to Ocean City, Md. Saturday, which saw much of its beloved pier and neighborhood obliterated by heavy flooding and intense winds. He expects 10 to 30 students from APO and alternative breaks to attend. The group will travel in three cars, leaving at 7 a.m. and returning that night.
“Watching all the images of the floods has really affected me and it reminded me of the images of Katrina,” Immekus, who has volunteered multiple times in New Orleans, said. “That really resonated with me, and I wanted to help.”
He said the team is not sure if there will be a system in place for volunteers just days after the storm came ashore, but that students would pick up debris and clear roads where it would safe.
The group also visited the American Red Cross Donation Center located at 2025 E St., for a blood drive.
“They really, really need blood,” senior Emma Yackso said. “Why wouldn’t you take an hour out of your day and give blood? It saves a life.”
Yackso said 15 APO members are expected to donate within the next week. Five already donated.
Steve Mavica, communications manager for the Red Cross, said most of the blood donations in the next few weeks will stay in the greater Chesapeake and Potomac region due to such high demand.
“Typically, we do not collect enough blood in the region to fulfill the demand,” Mavica said. “With the loss we’ve had in the region itself, the inventory will be even more stressed.”
If pressed, the D.C. branch may also send blood to highly affected areas such as New Jersey and New York, Mavica said. So far, the storm’s death toll in the U.S. has reached more than 50.

While Superstorm Sandy ravaged entire cities along the East Coast, Foggy Bottom and the D.C. area remained largely unscathed.
The only lasting effects of the 70 mph winds were a few toppled news stands and broken tree branches. Pumpkins and flower pots still stood on townhouse porches Tuesday morning amid light drizzles and mild gusts. Rain left the biggest impact, soaking University Yard and causing leaks in nearly a dozen residence halls.
Students reported that water seeped into halls through ceilings, windows, emergency doors, elevator shafts and electrical outlets during the steady rainfall and heavy winds Monday.
Alicia Knight, senior associate vice president for operations, declined to say which residence halls underwent repairs for water damage or the number of water-related FIXit requests GW fielded and responded to during the storm. But students posted pictures of the leaks in their halls to Twitter and Facebook, often showing trash bins and red cups collecting water, and pools of water on the floors.
“There was no significant storm-related damage on GW’s campuses, with the majority of incidents minor in nature – often related to window leaks, minor water pooling in stairwells near exterior entrances and ceiling leakage related to gutter overflow,” Knight said in an email.
She added that elevator shafts, designed to allow air ventilation, are prone to water leaks with heavy rains, but any issues in elevators were “quickly addressed.”
About 120 campus maintenance workers were on call round-the-clock and took shelter in the Support Building. Crews cleared brush – including a tree by the Metro reported to be the only felled tree in Foggy Bottom – as soon as the skies cleared Monday, leaving few branches on the ground by the time students woke up.
Knight added that the University prepared extensively for the storm, working with construction crews to minimize damage to signs, fencing and materials. The biggest issue facing work sites is now removing standing water at “several” of the construction pits around Foggy Bottom. With minimal impact to the sites, workers continued construction Wednesday.
The Vern Express, which stopped service Monday night after about 7 p.m., resumed Tuesday morning but shut down again Tuesday night around midnight. Residents of the Mount Vernon Campus lost power for several hours Monday, but students reported that electricity returned before nightfall. The Metro also restored service Tuesday afternoon, while transportation systems up the East Coast, most notably the New York City subway, will likely remain closed for the rest of the week.
The city was eerily quiet both Monday and Tuesday as the East Coast shut down, leaving the federal government closed for two days – half the time of the two-day shutdown following the 210 Snowpocalypse. Campus buildings – except for dining halls – closed for most of the storm, and Halloweekend festivities were largely confined to apartments and residence halls.
Several businesses in the area closed their doors early on Monday, fearing the menacing forecasts weather officials predicted. Convenience and grocery stores in D.C. ran out of flashlights, batteries, bottled water and some nonperishable goods as people stockpiled in preparation.
About 100,000 District residents were without power Tuesday, significantly less than during the last major storm to hit the D.C. area, Hurricane Irene.
Irene, which meteorologists called minor compared to Sandy, also largely missed GW. The hurricane on Aug. 27, 2011 knocked a tree onto Gelman Library and cancelled several University functions, but caused no long lasting damages. Bob Hainey, public relations manager for Pepco, said Tuesday’s outages were scattered around the city due to intense winds, rain and fallen trees.
Hainey said 90 percent of power was restored by Tuesday evening and 95 percent by Wednesday morning, expecting a complete restoration by Wednesday evening. He added that Pepco would donate $10,000 to the Red Cross’ relief efforts around the District.
The D.C. area’s sole power company faced backlash over a June 29 storm that knocked out power for more than 1 million people amid a 100-plus degree heat wave. Thousands of homes lost electricity for more than a week.
The main hub of activity on day two of GW’s shutdown was the American Red Cross’ national headquarters on E Street, where employees rushed to respond to the storm that clobbered New York, New Jersey and Connecticut Monday with emergency blood drives.
Storm waters ultimately did not breach the Georgetown waterfront shores, sparing businesses along the Potomac River from a reprise of the disastrous April 2011 floods that kept many restaurants closed August. The waterfront secured its floodgates Sunday.

Tucked in a parking lot along 20th Street, a student-run clinic, visible only by a small blue awning bearing its name, has quietly pulled in patients for 15 years.
But this fall, director of the Professional Psychology Program’s clinical training, James Hansell, said it has seen a 10 percent uptick in appointments, coinciding with escalating demand at nearby private practices and GW’s two main health centers, neither of which serve patients long term.
Patients have scheduled about 800 appointments with the graduate student-run clinic this month, 50 percent of which were students.
“We’re not sure about why this has increased, but possibly because of our greater visibility on campus,” Hansell, who started at GW this January, said. He added that with new leadership, intensified outreach around GW and Foggy Bottom and a fresh crop of students, Hansell says the clinic and the program are on an upswing.
Driving the increase, postdoctoral student Andrew Moon said, is the student-run center’s new ties with campus offices like Student Health Service and the University Counseling Center to increase referrals for students needing long-term help. The more than 100-student program is housed in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.
Both GW facilities have seen more appointments this fall, with SHS reporting a 40 percent increase over the last year. Senior Associate Dean Mark Levine, who oversees wellness issues, said earlier this year that the increase is pushed by a greater number of students who come to college already diagnosed with mental illness.
Several students have reported wait times of more than a month at the University counseling arms, though GW has been bulking up its staffing at the UCC. The University also put aside $40,000 to make up lost revenue at the UCC this fall so it could continue offering six free sessions to all students.
The UCC brought on a new director last month, Silvio Weisner, who said he plans to move forward with the University’s first committee to include representatives from all campus mental health offices to up communication and referrals.
Moon, who oversees graduate students’ work with patients, said the campus buzz about mental health has attracted more attention to the center, which charges students based on what they can afford and pledges never to turn away someone who cannot pay.
“This program isn’t new by any means, but I think word has finally spread that we’re an option,” Moon said, adding that word of mouth and outreach to community partners has been key. “We feel like our name is out there a little more, so we’re seeing an increase, which we appreciate and we need.”
The influx of patients at the Professional Psychology Program has prompted staff to reexamine its program offerings, which include individual counseling, couples therapy, psychological testing and group support.
The center offers group programs on topics like interpersonal skills and bereavement, and it recently added a transgender group and a women’s group – though both of the newer offerings have just a few members each.
Now, with increased demand and eager incoming students, staff say time is ripe for the program to expand its lineup. Moon said graduate students in the program come to him almost daily with new ideas like groups for parents, older adults and student-athletes.
A majority of groups are still stuck – “ready to go, just waiting for clients to come in,” with just one or two people expressing interest so far, Moon said.
One of his main focuses this fall is creating a new group focusing on gay, lesbian and bisexual issues. With the help of graduate student Melissa Hoffman, Moon is looking to grow interest around the University and community. He has reached out to the University’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the LGBT Resource Center to gauge and ultimately fuel interest in the group.
He said he is helping to create this specific support group because people who are gay, lesbian or bisexual may have different experiences and struggles that straight people have difficulty relating to.
“Straight people don’t usually have that coming-out process. Their lives aren’t usually as politicized. There are a lot of things that separate this group specifically,” Moon said.
But the future of the group programs depends on the rush of new clients this fall, and whether they want to seek out this second form of treatment.
Moon said he is optimistic that new clients this fall will translate to referrals for groups in the next few weeks as students pick out which groups their clients may be suited for. He said by now, in-house clinicians will have “had time to get to know the needs of their clients.”
Hoffman and Moon said group programs are becoming a national trend, serving as an efficient way to treat more patients at the same time. The program has a waitlist of about four weeks for individual appointments.
Being in a group, Hoffman said, is like creating a laboratory environment for clients to build confidence while testing out techniques.
The student program has grown more competitive academically, with a 15 percent rise in average GRE scores and 13 percent in GPA since the program started. Last fall, it received more than 400 applications to join and ultimately offered positions in the program to about 35 students.

The real scares will come the night after Halloween, when the demon barber of Fleet Street comes to campus.
Starting Thursday night, a Marvin Center stage will transform into a bloodthirsty barber’s shop for “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street” – a musical teeming with gore, angst and cannibalism.
Popularized by a 2007 Tim Burton film adaptation featuring Johnny Depp, the musical features Sweeney Todd, who lures his London neighbors into his barbershop and slashes their throats. His accomplice, Mrs. Lovett, a pie maker, bakes the bodies into pastry dough to hide the evidence.
A 12-foot cube set in the middle of the Dorothy Betts Marvin Theatre rotates automatically, simultaneously serving as the pie shop, Mrs.
Lovett’s parlor, the furnace area where the sinister pair burns the bodies and the streets of 19th century London. Sweeney Todd’s barber shop sits atop the cube – looming menacingly above the set and audience.
“He’s pervasive. He’s there all the time,” director Muriel Von Villas, a part-time faculty member in the music department, said. “Sort of like a puppeteer, watching from above and manipulating everything.”
The show’s widespread fame made it a strong choice for the main stage, she said.
“It’s fun and gory, and there’s a lot of good components to this,” Von Villas said. “I wanted it to be ugly and get uglier.”
An intricate set, a large cast and rehearsal time lost when Hurricane Sandy shut down the University added extra complexity to Sondheim’s challenging score and subjects.
“There are safety hazards,” Von Villas said. “There’s a lot of stage combat. We’re dealing with platforms. We’re dealing with a 12-foot cube with no railing on top. We’ve got people coming out of shoots.”
The cast prepared with stage combat rehearsals and practice stunts, but the automated set comes with dangers that are harder to control.
“The set is completely automated, and timing the scene shifts with this automation is a nightmare,” Von Villas said. “There are assets and liabilities to having something so complicated.”
Starring as Sweeney Todd is Michael Noel, who said he has practiced ominous vocals – and getting soaked in blood.
“I’ve got so much of it on my hands at the end of every performance,” he said, adding that he has mastered the art of making his throat-slashing look theatrical yet realistic.
He built his take on Sweeney Todd by watching past adaptations, including the Broadway revival and the film. Noel said his priority was to stay faithful to Stephen Sondheim’s text, which showcases the author’s mastery of diction and rhymes.
Noel also said audience members only familiar with the film may be surprised by the more dynamic character he presents.
“With close ups and cameras, there’s a little bit more opportunity on film. [Johnny Depp] did it with an incredibly blank, shallow emotion,
so he used a lot of subtlety in his expressions. But with the stage and the audience being 50 to 60 feet away and the lights on you, you’ve got to be a little bit bigger with things,” Noel said.
Senior Lizzy Marmon plays Mrs. Lovett. She said excitement for the show has been building since she was cast in May.
Marmon’s final moment in the play – which reveals a twist in her relationship with Sweeney Todd – is one she called daunting.
“My final moment is pretty terrifying. Trying to tackle that and what that desperation is, is what I’ve most been faced with,” Marmon said.
To portray her character, Marmon said she pulled from a number of sources, ultimately developing her own Mrs. Lovett with a bubbly, over-the-top take.
For both actors, this is the first time they will be working with such a complicated stage.
“Standing inside the cube and having it go around and hopping in and out of it is fun, it’s like a tilt-a-whirl, but it’s also a big piece of machinery that we try to avoid not being bowled over by. But I trust this crew so much,” Marmon said.
Noel spends much of the show atop the 12-foot, railing-less cube. Though at first the experience was intimidating, he said he is now confident.
Premiering the day after Halloween, the show is appropriately gory. Fake blood and theatrical effects contribute to an ominous, gruesome atmosphere.
“It’s a good thing we’re going up right after Halloween, “ Noel said. “I don’t think anyone is going to go home with nightmares about this, but hopefully there will be a bit of a moment when that blood comes out that people are going to be shocked by.”
Sweeney Todd runs Nov. 1 through Nov. 4 in the Dorothy Betts Marvin Theatre.

Clarification appended
GW will launch its first online public health master’s degree after collecting a multi-million dollar investment through a partnership with an education startup.
2U, an education startup co-founded by alumnus Chip Paucek, has picked up about $100 million in capital investments in its first four years and is targeting one university per degree area to lift above the competition as online graduate programs multiply across the country.
It will funnel a chunk of that cash back into the School of Public Health and Health Services’ online degree program, just like it has with programs at schools like University of North Carolina and Georgetown University.
The company has invested $10 million up front in each of those programs, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
But the amount GW will receive will depend on the number of students recruited, said Stacey DiLorenzo, the school’s executive director of communications. The public health school is targeting about 50 students for its first cohort, which will start classes in May.
The degree, announced Tuesday with the official name MPH@GW, will use interactive videos and employ top public health school faculty to allow students to take classes at home with weekly video and chat sessions with professors and their peers.
“Through the use of video and interactive technologies, the MPH@GW degree will provide students with a much more robust educational experience, more like a ‘virtual campus’ than a series of online course offerings,” DiLorenzo said.
Students will pay as much for that virtual campus as they would for attending classes on the physical campus, with tuition for the online program equaling the offline fee of $56,160 for 45 credits. DiLorenzo said the program will help students save money by allowing them to earn a GW degree without moving to D.C. or paying the city’s cost of living.
The school’s top faculty will teach the program, maintaining a 10-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio.
Developing online graduate programs also helps the University build up tuition dollars by sliding under the city-regulated enrollment cap, which limits the number of students that may take classes on the Foggy Bottom Campus.
The University has looked increasingly toward online graduate programs and programs called hybrids that mix online and classroom time. The GW School of Business will launch four online programs with the education company Pearson, which will serve similar functions as 2U will with the public health school.

The men’s golf team faced a different kind of challenge in their final tournament of the season early this week: returning to Foggy Bottom.
Hurricane Sandy interfered with plans, cancelling flights and forcing the team to take rental cars home. But the Colonials played their way to a 20th-place finish, out of 26 teams, on the windy golf course at the Wendy’s Kiawah Classic.
They carded a three-day score of 75-over-par 927 at the par-71, 7,701-yard Turtle Point Golf Course, gritting through 25- to 30-mile-per-hour winds in South Carolina – making for a “very tough, tough golf course,” head coach Terry Shaffer said.
“The greens were pretty fast,” Shaffer said. “The wind actually affected the roll of the ball, which was kind of unusual.”
Not only did the ball break the wrong way at times, but the Colonials’ long game took a hit with the wind knocking down many drives before they could sail to their desired locations.
But despite the multiple challenges, Shaffer said he thought the Colonials still played fairly well.
“We struck the ball well, we got to work on our short game a little bit, get things down and get things moved in the position we want,” Shaffer said.
Sophomore Jack Persons has presented the best performance for GW throughout the fall season, and he did not disappoint at the Kiawah Classic, shooting an 11-over 224 throughout the three days of competition to finish in a tie for 28th in a field of over 130 golfers. Persons credited his success in the inclement conditions to his “solid short game,” adding that it helped him play through the challenging drives.
His best round came on Monday, when he carded a second round score of 1-under 70. The standout sophomore finished with back-to-back bogies, but he still led the team and moved himself up to a tie for 14th at the end of the second round, before a 7-over 78 in round three cemented his final rank.
“I wedged that round with a couple of pretty mediocre rounds. I kind of let the wind get to me overall. I know I could have played a lot better, but it’s something that I look forward to in the spring,” Persons said.
The spring season starts in February for the team, and following its five-tournament fall season, the Colonials are looking forward to defending their conference championship.
The fall season didn’t display the sort of dominance fans may have expected from reigning league champions, but Shaffer isn’t discouraged. It gave the team a chance to realize – and correct – its own weaknesses before the A-10 season begins, the head coach said.
Persons agreed, adding that the frustration of the fall gives GW an added edge heading into spring play.
“There were a lot of poor performances, and it’s something to say that we have a chip on our shoulders now and we can go out and play better in the spring and prove that the conference championship wasn’t a fluke,” Persons said.

The University will face a collective action lawsuit from employees who claim they were shortchanged, a U.S. District Court judge ruled last week.
David Driscoll, the former executive coordinator in the Office of Teaching and Learning, claims that the University owes him and others in similar positions overtime pay from 2011. The judge ruled that employees in three positions within the University may have been underpaid by the college and must be notified about the opportunity to join the lawsuit.
The ruling stripped down Driscoll’s original lawsuit, which would have included employees in five positions.
He claims that he received only 24 hours of overtime pay for two years’ worth of earned overtime hours, after GW conducted a review of its policies. He said other employees likely faced the same fate.
Judge Ellen Huvelle ruled Oct. 25 that the two employees who were booted from the collective action were not eligible to join the lawsuit, nor were employees who worked at GW prior to the review, Michael Sweeney, Driscoll’s attorney, said.
“The court has discretion on how they do these things, and the judge made a reasonable decision and we respect the decision,” Sweeney said. “That’s why we bring a class – because we want to help as many people as possible, but at the end of the day, the court has a decision to make.”
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to comment on the judge’s ruling and the process going forward, citing a policy to not comment on pending litigation. Sweeney said the decision to exclude both parties was based on the University’s account that those positions did not earn overtime pay.
He added that he and GW must both submit a notice letter to the court by Friday, at which point a common letter will be agreed upon.
Because the class is collective action, all individuals qualifying for the classes would be notified and given 60 days to opt in. Sweeney said.
Collective action cases typically include responses from about 10 to 25 percent of the class, unlike class action cases in which individuals that qualify are automatically added to the suit.
“We would like everybody to join,” Sweeney said. “We think they’ve taken advantage of everyone involved and everyone is due additional back wages.”

The medical school is expanding its health and wellness offerings this fall to help students endure four taxing years of academics and hospital rotations.
The School of Medicine and Health Sciences added workout gear like hula hoops and dumbbells to its library and began offering Zumba, yoga and cooking classes to de-stress students faced with shrinking residency opportunities nationwide.
The wellness initiative precludes the school’s community health committee, which will meet for the first time this week. The committee will look for pathways to incorporate physical, mental and spiritual health into the medical school’s curriculum, including potential courses that could be added in time for the school’s broader curriculum overhaul next year.
But yanking students away from studying slides and lab notes to take time for themselves is a challenge, Christina Puchalski, director of the GW Institute for Spirituality and Health, said.
About 50 students so far have participated in classes or sessions in exercise or health offered by the Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library, the library reported.
“If you’re a student and you have to pass a certain number of exams, that will take priority over taking care of yourself. Unless you can see that taking care of yourself will help you overall,” Puchalski, who sits on the committee, said.
Alexandra Gomes, associate director of the library, said the library has for years seen pressure mounting for students, particularly around exams.
“Students set up camp in the library as we get closer to the end of the semester and the exams, and you can see the pressure build up in the students,” Gomes said.
The administration is also spending more on health and wellness. Linda Lang, an instructor, has taught yoga classes for two years and said this is the first year she is a paid staff member.
Last year was the first time the yoga course was offered as a 1.5-credit elective that included nearly three dozen students.
“What people seem to enjoy most is being in a place with other students to talk about what stress is really like and how it’s weighing on their time,” Lang said.
Third-year medical student Rosa Liu said medical school could at times be “a toxic environment” and that first- and second-year students in particular need a mental break from stressing over slides and notes.
“A lot of people feel competition within themselves and are pushing themselves to do better. Yoga can bring that down a little bit and say it’s okay to accept yourselves,” she said.
The efforts are a quick-fix on a nationwide epidemic at medical schools: rising stress levels and burnout rates. One-third of medical students said their life-work balance was out of whack and 15 percent said their lives were “somewhat bad” or “as bad as it can be,” according to a study last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The outlook for residencies could still get worse. A report last week by the Association of American Medical Colleges stoked fears that a cap on the number of federally funded residencies would limit the next generation of students looking for medical training, creating even more competition.
Over the last five years, about 92 to 98 percent of GW’s medical students have been placed into residencies – the stage after medical school during which aspiring doctors work for three to seven years in hospitals or medical centers. That rate is slightly better than how students have fared nationally, but their chances will likely grow slimmer over the next decade because of the federal cap. It would grow even more competitive for the majority of GW students who opt for specialized, competitive fields like radiology or anesthesiology, which draw higher salaries.
