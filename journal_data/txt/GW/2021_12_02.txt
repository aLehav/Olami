Many students graduate from GW with excess funds on their GWorld cards that ultimately get forfeited to the D.C. government. 
Students should undoubtedly have the right to receive their own money back after graduation, but since they don’t, administrators should at least provide students with options to donate their excess funds. Some students, rather than forfeit their money to the bureaucratic black hole that is the D.C. government, might be incentivized to go on a somewhat frivolous spending spree at various GWorld vendors before they graduate. But donating the funds to local non profits would be a better use of the excess money students have. 
With GWorld, students cannot directly donate to local D.C. non-profits, and even if they make the effort to buy items using GWorld to donate to organizations, they only have access to fewer items that are more costly than at other stories. In alignment with its claimed dedication to community service and engagement, the University should start looking into ways for students to easily donate their excess GWorld to local organizations.
I attempted such a fundraiser this fall, helping orchestrate a partnership during the past semester between the Christian fellowship group InterVarsity, and Miriam’s Kitchen, a non-profit in Foggy Bottom that serves the neighborhood’s unhoused population. The general plan was to gather a group of students to buy all the items with GWorld needed for the fundraiser at CVS and then package those items to deliver to Miriam’s kitchen.
Although successful, the fundraiser ended up being substantially more difficult than it needed to be. Our goal was to compile 200 gift bags filled with supplies like razors, toothpaste and soap to be handed out near Thanksgiving to Miriam’s Kitchen’s guests. The total cost of these 200 gift bags, if everything was bought online, would have been about $400, but using GWorld at CVS the total cost would have been about $3,000.
Even if we managed to raise $3,000, we could not, in good conscience, direct the donations of students to such a colossal waste. Instead, GWorld donated by students would only pay for razors and the Ziploc bags, which were about the same price as the online options. Students who lived off campus or were otherwise not bound by GWorld bought the rest of the items in bulk from Amazon. With the generosity of the leaders and members of InterVarsity, we raised a total of $508 combined from both GWorld and other donations, and delivered 200 pre-packaged gift bags to Miriam’s Kitchen. But for a fundraiser that started with the goal of trying to put students’ excess GWorld to good use, we spent far less GWorld spent on that fundraiser than hoped.
The generosity of GW students is incredible. But the barriers imposed by GWorld prevented us from fully taking advantage of that generosity by imposing needless inefficiencies and limiting the choice of items that could be donated.
There are a hundred solutions to this problem, but the most straightforward one is having the GW office carry out a program they already have in place. The office rents out GWorld machines to student orgs for fundraising purposes. But when I asked if InterVarsity could borrow one for this fundraiser, they said no, and that they had closed down that program. Allowing students to donate their excess GWorld to student orgs for fundraising would have solved most of the problems imposed by GWorld in this fundraiser. Instead of students having to go through CVS to buy items, student organizations would instead have access to websites like Amazon to buy a wide variety of cost effective items.
Alternatively GW can partner with food kitchens around D.C. in the same manner that Swipe Out Hunger began last fall to help alleviate food insecurity for students. Or they can just give us our money back at the end of our time here like most normal universities across the country. 
At present, such a large-scale initiative is almost impossible because the current GWorld system actively prevents students from using their own money for the good of the D.C. community. To enhance the University’s mission of community service, GW should allow students to donate their GWorld money.

About two weeks ago, thousands of students logged on to their computers for the split-second race to register for classes. But for all the preparation that many put in, poor Wi-Fi often stood in the way of them and their dream classes.
Strong internet connection is necessary for succeeding in today’s technology oriented environment, but unfortunately GW’s slow and spotty Wi-Fi can make online work more difficult and success in classes less attainable. Class registration just scratches the surface of all the activities students need internet connection for – we use it for doing online research, reading textbooks, watching class lectures and accessing Blackboard.
Needless to say, the majority of work done requires that students have access to steady and fast WiFi. Students also need a connection to call family back home, sign up for a COVID-19 test or email a professor. The list could go on, but the message stays the same: a college student’s need for Wi-Fi is ubiquitous.
In my experience, having a stable connection to GWireless for more than a half hour at a time is rare. Doing research that requires opening several tabs at a time can be especially frustrating, since a lull in internet connection means it can take at least another couple of minutes before I can do my next Google search. Video calls over GWireless are also especially difficult. Because videos use a large amount of bandwidth, it is not unusual for calls to stop or reload if there is not enough internet. Slow internet connection interrupts a variety of uses from online office hours over Zoom to calling family over WhatsApp.
The Wi-Fi issues extend into the Vern Express too. The Vex’s Wi-Fi – where each bus has its own server – has never worked for me during my daily trips to the Mount Vernon Campus. For a time-pressed student, the ability to connect to the internet on their commute could help them complete a last-minute assignment.
Just a generation ago, reliable WiFi was considered more of a convenience than a necessity. But today, the pace of work and expectations of communication demand that students have good Wi-Fi. Do you have a 30-minute quiz on Blackboard? A lull in WiFi could mean you don’t have enough time to finish it. What about a job interview? A frozen screen could disrupt a flowing conversation with a future employer. Many students deal with issues like these on a day-to-day basis. Some students I have talked to have been unable to register for classes they need for next semester, while others say that their school work takes significantly longer to complete. For today’s students, dysfunctional Wi-Fi is the equivalent of being locked out of a classroom, library or office. 
GW Information Technology has recognized the need for consistent Wi-Fi, noting on its website that each day more than 50,000 devices connect to GW’s internet. In response to the clear need for a strong internet, officials devised a plan called NextGen in 2019, promising to give GW “faster wireless speeds, improved roaming experiences, more robust coverage and better performance in congested areas.” That plan was slated to be completed in October 2020, but more than a year after the transition, students are still struggling to connect to reliable Wi-Fi.
It is evident that the IT department understands that internet connection is a necessity for the modern campus. But this recognition has not led to consistent internet connection across all of GW. The department should lead another review of the quality of internet connection across GW, focusing especially on the spotty connection in residence hall rooms and the lack of WiFi on the Vex buses.
GW should also look towards other universities’ strategies in providing their students Wi-Fi. The University of Michigan went through a bold upgrade of its internet services this past year starting with residence hall rooms over the summer and then expanding to academic buildings and even outside areas during the school year. Taking account of students’ patterns of internet use would be a smart way to go about fixing the WiFi issues at GW. 
Quality and consistent WiFi is a necessity for students taking classes in today’s day and age. Administrators must improve WiFi to ensure students can be as successful as possible during their time at GW.

Bernson led the team to the Final Four of the A-10 Championship in her first year as head coach but only recorded one winning year in her five seasons leading GW’s squad.
Volleyball head coach Sarah Bernson will not be returning to the program after serving four years in the position.
The department announced last month that Bernson will not return as coach and athletics officials will immediately begin the search for a new head coach. The announcement came just two days after Bernson announced the addition of three new recruits for the 2022 season.
“We appreciate Sarah’s years of service to our GW student-athletes and our alumnae,” Athletic Director Tanya Vogel said in the release. “Sarah led our volleyball program through exceedingly difficult times and was a key contributor to the lives and experiences of our staff as well. We are grateful to Coach Bernson for her commitment to her student-athletes and her contributions to our entire department.”
Athletics communication associate Ashley Harding declined to facilitate interviews with department officials regarding the exit.
Bernson first came to the program as its ninth head coach during the 2017-18 season. During her debut season with the Colonials, Bernson led volleyball to the final four of the Atlantic 10 Championship, where they became the first team in A-10 history to win in the current postseason format as the No. 6 seed, toppling No. 3 Saint Louis in a wild five set affair. The Colonials finished the year with an 11-21 record and a 6-8 conference mark.
During her second year at the helm, the Colonials hit an 11-15 mark, closing the season on a strong note after winning their final three matches. In the following season, the Colonials entered the A-10 championship as the No. 4 seed, their highest seeding since 2015. She finished her career at GW with a 40-84 overall record and registered only one winning year through five seasons, earning a 15-14 overall and 8-6 conference record in 2019.
Before coming to GW, Bernson served as an assistant coach at American University for five seasons, where she helped the Eagles to an overall record of 136-36 with four consecutive Patriot League Championships and trips to the NCAA tournament.
Prior to her time at American, she spent eight seasons at Cornell, including three years as the head coach, where she led the Big Red to three Ivy League Championships from 2004-06 and two NCAA tournament appearances. Her time at Cornell was highlighted by the development of the program’s first ever All-American and all-time kills leader.

The Colonials held a lead going into halftime but could not stay in front through the end of the game.
Nine games into the season, men’s basketball is still struggling to gain momentum.
The men’s squad (2-7) lost five of their last six games, beginning with a 56-67 loss to Massachusetts Lowell (5-3) Nov. 19, marking their fourth consecutive loss at the time. After leading by nine points at the end of the first half, the Colonials were outscored 41-21 by the River Hawks in the second half.
“I thought we played well enough defensively to get the victory but we just got to figure out what we got to do on offense to score the ball and at this point we haven’t figured it out yet,” head coach Jamion Christian said.
Massachusetts Lowell started strong, earning a 10-0 lead with 14:44 left in the first half. The Colonials scored their first points of the game with 13:54 remaining, as junior guard James Bishop drew a 3-point shooting foul and sank all three free throws. Shortly after, Junior forward Qwanzi Samuels grabbed a rebound and passed it to freshman guard Brayon Freeman, who pushed the ball in transition and hit a tough layup with 13:34 left.
The Colonials continued to score at a rapid pace for the next three minutes, with a Brendan Adams three pointer capping off a 19-2 run that put the score at 19-12 with the Colonials in front with 10:35 left in the half.
GW held on to their lead for the rest of the half, due in large part to the play of Bishop, who scored 12 first half points and hit a jump shot with six seconds left, which put the score at 35-26 at halftime. The Colonials were also helped by Freeman, who scored seven points on 3-of-3 shooting and sophomore guard Joe Bamisile, who scored six points and grabbed 8 first half rebounds.
The Colonials hit 5-of-7 first half 3-pointers compared to the River Hawks’ 3-of-15 from deep. They found success in pushing the ball and attacking in transition, scoring 10 points off of fastbreaks and making 10-of-12 from the free throw line.
“The quality of shots we got in the first half were so good, how we were moving the ball offensively,” Christian said. “The second half we just didn’t move the ball as well. Part of that is they were getting to the free throw line a lot through the second half to kind of slow momentum down”.
The River Hawks started the second half on a 6-0 run, getting back within three points with 18:19 left. A jumper by forward Alin Blunt tied the game at 39-39 with 15:27 remaining in the second half.
The River Hawks went on to outscore the Colonials by 11 points through the rest of the game, finding great success in the paint, scoring 17 of their final 19 points off of points in the paint and free throws.
With 2:08 left in the game, the Colonials started intentionally fouling UML in hopes of slowing the game down and getting more opportunities to score. With one minute left, the Colonials started a full court press on UML, which the River Hawks were able to easily break- leading to two consecutive dunks by forward Max Brooks within 10 seconds of each other. This effectively sealed the game with 0:47 left as the River Hawks were up 65-54 at this point. The River Hawks went on to win the game by 11 points: 67-56.
The Colonials shot just 28.6 percent from the field in the second half compared to Massachusetts Lowell’s 54.8 field goal percentage. GW allowed 21 points off turnovers in total, while only scoring nine points themselves off of River Hawk turnovers.
“We just got to make better decisions. You know, I think a lot of what I’m looking at is 19 turnovers. But we probably have, you know, five to 10 shot turnovers, particularly tough shots. And when you miss those shots, you give them easy shots in transition. We just got to get- we just got to get tougher and tougher and just better on the offense before we make a decision.”
Despite the loss, the Colonials put up a strong defensive showing, limiting the River Hawks to 14.3 percent from beyond the arc and outrebounded them 43-36.
“Our guys were great defensively,” Christian said. “They were flying around, they were connected, we made them take a lot of tough shots. We rebounded the ball to finish possessions. They were one of the best 3-point teams in the nation, so we did great in that area.”
Following the home loss, the Colonials went down to the Naples Invitational. After taking down Wright State (1-5) Nov. 22 in a 74-63 over the Horizon League champions.
The Colonials shot at a then season-best .475 clip from the field while keeping the Raiders to 35.4 percent shooting and 12 points below its season scoring average.
Despite shooting at another season-best 52 percent from the floor in the semifinal against Kent State (4-2), the Golden Flashes nearly matched them with 51.9 percent to emerge victorious 77-69.
The Colonials trailed for the whole second half but went on a 10-0 scoring run to cut the deficit to four with 47 seconds left, before Kent State converted a free throw and a layup to quell the comeback.
The Golden Flashes took better chance of their opportunities, scoring 18 points off of 13 GW turnovers, while burying 10 three point buckets in total.
After jumping out to an early 11-3 lead, the Colonials fell behind 33-26 by halftime. Kent State extended their lead in the second half, pushing it to 17 four minutes in, effectively consolidating their lead as the Colonials attempted to chip away for the rest of the game.
In the third place game Nov. 24, the Colonials pulled within seven points of Missouri State (4-3) in the second half, but the Colonials ultimately fell 72-54 to slip to fourth place.
After trailing by just seven points in the first five minutes of the second frame, Adams stole the ball and attempted a dunk on the breakaway before being taken down midair. GW suffered two technical fouls afterward, and the Bears compiled a 12-0 run over 90 seconds to regain a 19-point lead and never looked back.
Bishop led GW in scoring for the fifth straight game, accumulating 17 points and a pair of assists and rebounds. Bamisile earned 12 points, posting double digits for the seventh time this season.
The Colonials will look to bounce back after suffering another home loss to Boston University Wednesday night. The Colonials will hit the road again to take on Charlotte Saturday for a 2 p.m. tipoff.

Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, said students majoring in humanities should spend their time in college listening to opinions from across the political spectrum. 
A U.S. representative from Texas spoke before about 50 students at the University Student Center amphitheater Tuesday, airing his concerns about limited police spending and the risk of foreign Russian invasion.
Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, reflected on his academic and professional career at the event, discussing how social justice movements have pressured governments into defunding the police and stressing the need to forge diplomatic ties with Ukraine to deter potential military conflict with Russia. GW College Republicans hosted the talk, which was moderated by senior Patrick Burland, the organization’s chairman.
Sessions kicked off the event by reflecting on his early interest in politics and government, which developed as he read about the benefits of market capitalism and the democratic process where private citizens can elect their own leaders. He said students studying topics like political science and economics should use their time in higher education to listen to opinions and ideas from across the political spectrum and form their own political ideologies.
“I think it’s always important for you as students to have an idea about your expectations of your country,” he said at the event.
Sessions said he’s concerned that cities like Austin, Texas and Portland, Oregon are becoming increasingly unsafe because of cuts to local police department budgets, which could slow the response process and lower officers’ safety in emergency situations. He said calls to defund the police during Black Lives Matter protests last May have influenced the drop in funding.
“What I will tell you is that the police are unfairly treated,” he said. “They make house calls because people call them to be there and there’s somebody that’s a victim, and now many times they are that person.”
Sessions said BLM protesters from the last two years took advantage of the lack of law enforcement in cities like Ferguson, Missouri and Baltimore, which was unjustified and led to serious injuries. He said government officials should support officers to combat rioters and looters who pose a threat to American civilization, but endorsing alt-right groups like the Proud Boys is not the solution.
“It’s not so cool when your wife is not safe,” he said. “It’s not so cool when somebody comes and takes you out of your car and beat you up, or when you have a disabled child or when you need to get somewhere. You need orderly processes where you need people who can help.”
He said President Joe Biden’s administration should also take a “clear” stance against Russian military intervention in Ukraine because of a recent increase in Russian military forces in the region. He said the U.S. military could retaliate from bases in Norway and Turkey in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
He said unlike the administration of former President Donald Trump, Biden’s support for America’s international democratic allies has been unclear. Sessions said the United States should commit to protecting free countries, like Ukraine and Taiwan, which seek democratic independence through military and diplomatic force.
He said foreign relations remains a complicated issue, and that the administration should be “prepared” to defend American allies abroad but also tread lightly when necessary.
“We have to be careful, and it’s a very difficult time,” he said. “So I think that we should be prepared.”

Diaz said officials are looking to address a variety of building access enforcement issues, like “tailgating’ that allows people to follow others inside buildings without showing ID.
Officials announced a three-year plan to enhance campus accessibility across University buildings in an email to the University community Wednesday, funded by a $22 million investment in physical renovations.
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz introduced the accessibility project along a series of newly completed updates to campus security, which equipped all University buildings with electronic access and registered all students for mobile alerts and advisories from a new emergency notification system. Diaz said the accessibility project will span campus buildings including Potomac House, The Aston and Somers, Ames and Francis Scott Key halls, where officials will redesign or reconstruct stairways, ramps, doors and elevators among other upgrades. 
“We have completed a comprehensive review of building accessibility and committed significant resources to projects over the next three years that will ensure all of our buildings are accessible and compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act,” he said in the email. “The projects are well underway so be on the lookout.”
Diaz said the University kicked off the accessibility improvement projects at the turn of the new fiscal year in July after the Board of Trustees approved the budget for the renovations this spring. He said GW commissioned a pair of assessments on University facilities and campus accessibility in 2020, which yielded the findings that officials will use to guide the renovations.
“Once we got that approved in late spring, over the summer, we started to assemble all these projects, started to get the bid out and they became real,” he said in an interview. “So they’re all now in different varying stages of the process.”
Diaz said the University’s completed access control updates will equip buildings with personalized tap and allow GW Police Department officers to lock doors remotely. GWPD officers will also respond to classrooms that faculty lockdown with new emergency buttons that were installed in classrooms earlier this fall as part of the finished project.
Diaz said the upgrade to an electronic access control platform, moving away from physical keys that community members used to use to enter buildings and rooms, enables these quick emergency responses and can shut off access to all campus buildings.
“We can now say that every residential unit, every building, every classroom in GW on all campuses now are equipped with electronic access,” Diaz said. “We have the ability now to, ‘with the push of a single button’ – and I put quotes around that because it’s not literally a button, it’s a virtual platform — we can lock down the entire University.”
Diaz said officials are testing technologies to better monitor who enters campus buildings and enforce entry violations, including “tailgating,” when people enter buildings behind students without showing identification.
He said officials installed a new integrated emergency notification platform this fall called Informacast, owned by tech company Singlewire Software, this fall. Diaz added that officials are continuing to compile faculty and staff phone numbers, so all GW community members can receive advisories and alerts.
“This will help reduce response times and expand outreach when both are needed the most,” he said. “The system can alert cell phones, university computers, campus IP phones and digital signs simultaneously.”

sPACEYcLOUD’s Russian dumplings combine the flavors of vegan chicken, spices and broth.
Make your way to Adams Morgan to check out sPACYcLOUd, a hip restaurant restaurant filled with funky decor, a friendly atmosphere and one-of-a-kind vegan Russian cuisine.
Located at 2309 18th St. NW on Adams Morgan’s liveliest street, sPACYcLOUd is serving up traditional Russian dishes with a vegan twist. The two-story restaurant, bar and shop is known for its laid back and hipster atmosphere crafted by owner Tatiana Kolina, and its cocktails, beer and food.
Walking into the downstairs lounge and bar area is like stepping into another world where art, skateboarding and food all intersect. The walls are adorned with colorful abstract pieces of African art, often depicting women and elephants, for their strength. The lounge is furnished with velvet couches and chairs ranging in colors from cream to purple to dusty orange and vibrant painted pink walls, a sharp contrast to the dark, earthy and underground feel of the bar and upstairs area.
The upstairs includes traditional restaurant seating, while the downstairs lounge is a spacious room filled with couches and chairs, perfect for enjoying dinner with a large group of friends. Russian rap and rock plays aloud with collections of skate, surf and snow boards proudly displayed on the walls, contributing to the space’s stylish atmosphere.
The restaurant is outfitted with two bars – one on each story. The downstairs bar serves specialty cocktails while Eastern European beers and Georgian wines can be found at the upstairs bar, which is adorned with decorated skateboards and sPACYcLOUd merchandise available for purchase.
While you enjoy your food or drink, you will no doubt meet Kolina, the owner, lovingly referred to by all of the staff as Tati. A first generation Russian immigrant, Kolina created sPACYcLOUd with three core values in mind – empowerment, sustainability and wellness.
While I was there, she made an effort to get to know myself and other guests, frequently checking in on the food and experience, and even taking photos for the sPACYcLOUd Instagram page. Kolina is also active in the D.C. skate community, often hosting skating clinics for young girls on the street outside the shop.
The shop’s atmosphere and back story captivate customers, but the food can definitely not be written off. The small menu presents a well-crafted display of Eastern European cuisine.
Start off with the peasant potatoes ($12), crispy fried potato cubes served with a rotating side and creamy, spicy, house made sauce. For a main dish, you can’t go wrong with the fish and chips ($22), mushroom and potato stew ($16), stuffed cabbage ($22), Berlin-style veggie wurst ($11) or the Beyond meat burger ($15).
I opted for the pelmeni ($18), traditional Russian dumplings with a rotating filling wrapped in dough. The filling of the day was vegan chicken, which made for a flavor burst as the veggie meat escaped from the soft dough wrapping. The chewy filling was a combination of the “chicken,” spices and broth. The dumplings were served with a generous dollop of vegan sour cream garnished with dill adding a refreshing contrast to the dish with its cool temperature and light taste.
The dumplings themselves were small balls of dough, stuffed with the vegan chicken filling, boiled and then served in a soup-like bowl perfect for catching the soupy juice that explodes from the dumplings the minute you bite into them. These homecooked and traditional bite-sized dumplings evoked feelings of warmth and comfort, each one melting in your mouth with each bite.
The dumplings taste so delectable it’s easy to forget that they are also vegan. As a vegetarian, I am used to trying plant-based takes on traditional meat dishes and these dumplings certainly passed the test.
Stop by sPACYcLOUd the next time you’re in Adams Morgan for distinct Russian cuisine, great conversation and a funky atmosphere.

Head Coach Barry King said the team struggled to turn to new leaders after losing several veterans in 2019.
Despite coming off a shortened season and a rocky start, men’s water polo rallied together throughout the season to make a playoff run and provide hope for next year.
The Colonials finished with a record just below .500 at 12-14, but with a stronger conference record of 7-5. The team finished third in their conference tournament, narrowly missing regionals and falling just short of a fifth trip to the conference title in six years.
While the team did not get off to a hot start, falling to 1-6 in their first seven games, head coach Barry King said the team rallied and played “much better” water polo at the end of the year than at the start.
“In terms of our goal of being better and making each other better, I think we did that in the face of some fairly trying circumstances over the last couple years,” King said. “And quite frankly, I didn’t really know what to expect out of this group.”
King said the team struggled making the transition to find consistent leadership among themselves after losing several key veteran players and multi-year all-conference honorees, including former utility player Atakan Destici and center Andrew Mavis, to graduation in 2019.
Additionally, the team played 26 matches instead of its usual 30 to 32 this past season. But the previous season was heavily shortened, with only five matches in total due to pandemic-related cancellations.
“We lost a year of fitness too,” King said. “Our inability to get into the weight room on a consistent basis, you know, our practice times were limited and disjointed and all that kind of stuff for an entire year. So we showed up, probably as out of shape and less fit than we ever have been.”
King said “the good news” was that the team knew they would have to approach their fitness with a greater sense of urgency this year and accepted the challenge.
Senior utility player Nick Schroeder said the team made an active effort to stay as close to each other socially as they could and seized any opportunity they had to practice and keep playing before the season began.
“By the end of the year, besides a couple people catching COVID, COVID did not have all that big of an impact on us,” Schroeder said. “We were able to fight through it.”
After dropping six straight games following their win over Iona to start the season, the team faced a season defining moment in a rematch with Brown Sept. 18 after losing to the Bears just a week prior. King said the 12-11 overtime win proved to be a major turning point for the team.
“We could have easily just folded our tents and just been a really bad water polo team from that point on,” King said. “And we came off getting smoked by Harvard, but turned it around and beat a team that we had lost to the week before.”
This win kicked off the start of a four game win streak and a 5-1 run including the following two games. The team was re-energized and set for the conference tournament. While only placing third, two players earned all-conference accolades – Sophomore goalkeeper Luca Castorina and center Viktor Jovanovic.
Both players had record seasons, as Castorina nearly set a new single-season saves record with 349 saves while Jovanovic set the school’s single-season drawn exclusions record at 79. King said Castorina is “as good as it gets” and the duo were the “story of the year.”
“Victor Jovanovic improved so much,” King said. “His trajectory is basically the trajectory of the team in terms of our improvement and everything. He was struggling to find a place and trying to fit into the system and became a dominant center in the league.”
The team rode their stars to a turnaround second half of the season and a third place finish at the MAWPC Championship. In the playoffs, the Colonials took down John Hopkins 12-6 in a dominant performance before falling to Navy in the semifinal 11-7. But GW went on to defeat Wagner in the third place game, winning 11-9 after scoring two goals to go ahead in the last five minutes.
The third place finish was not the result the team was hoping for, but the season has set up the team for a positive outlook as they look forward to the next one. Schroeder ended up setting career highs in goals and points with 43 and 63 respectively across 26 total games, placing him second on the squad in both statistics.
“It’s disappointing because we felt like we could win,” Schroeder said. “But seeing the growth of where we started, where we got to was really nice.”
Despite being a senior, Schroeder will return next year as he looks to earn a master’s degree at GW and look to win one last time after not being able to fully compete in his junior year. Schroeder said the team will have to adopt yet another new identity as the team’s leader in goals and co-leader in assists, graduate student utility player Andras Levai, will move on next year.
“But we definitely have a really solid core,” Schroeder said. “We have the best goalie in the conference. We have one of the better centers, if not the best center in the conference next year.”

Vice President of Finance and Treasurer Bruno Fernandes said the hotel has been a “valuable investment” in the past but is not central to GW’s academic mission.
GW is searching for a real estate investor to purchase or lease the One Washington Circle Hotel property as the space enters its last semester as a residence hall this spring.
The University, which has owned the building since 2001, repurposed the site from a hotel to a temporary residential building for juniors and seniors while Thurston Hall remains under reconstruction until its targeted reopening next fall. Officials said in a release Wednesday that they hope to complete a transaction by the summer, and Savills – a property advisory firm – will help the University find a real estate investor or developer.
Savills has collaborated with GW in the past, assisting with the University’s sale of the 824 New Hampshire Ave. property in 2016.
Bruno Fernandes, the vice president of finance and treasurer, said the One Washington Circle property is not central to the University’s academic mission, despite serving as a “valuable investment” in the past.
“The current state of the capital markets and the demand for multifamily and hotel properties in Washington, D.C. renders this a perfect time to market the property and explore a sale or ground lease of this asset in support of our broader academic goals,” he said in the release.
GW has operated the hotel with third-party companies, like Modus Hotels – a hotel development company until this fall.
