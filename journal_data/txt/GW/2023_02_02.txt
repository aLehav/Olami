Students said the focus groups took place at the Behavioral Laboratory on the third floor of Duquès Hall, where officials from the Chicago-based marketing firm Yes& Lipman Hearne watched from behind a one-way mirror.

Updated: Feb. 4, 2023 at 12:52 p.m.
Students said officials started surveying their opinions on more than a dozen ideas for GW’s next moniker at a series of private focus groups this week.
Students who participated in the focus groups, which were not open to the public, said a marketing firm introduced 15 moniker options in Duquès Hall Wednesday and Thursday, including The Fog, Revolutionaries, Sentinels and Monumentals. Officials will conduct a total of six focus groups with Chicago-based marketing firm Yes& Lipman Hearne, according to an audio recording of a Wednesday meeting obtained by The Hatchet.
Nine student participants, who asked to remain anonymous because they were unsure if they were allowed to speak about the meeting, said the list of monikers included Fireworks, Cavalry, Ambassadors, Foghoppers, Fogriders, The Revolution, Firecrackers, Independence, Independents, The Buzz and Blue Fog. Some students said officials urged them to keep the discussions private.
The Barstool GW Instagram account first reported the list of 15 nicknames Wednesday night.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said officials are “exploring” options for the new moniker and are “gathering feedback” from community members. Metjian declined to say how officials selected the moniker options, what role focus groups will play in the final selection and if officials will host surveys for faculty and staff.
“In the coming weeks, we will share some of these options publicly with the entire GW community for additional input,” Metjian said in an email. “We recognize that the selection of the new moniker is an important decision, and we look forward to a robust engagement effort that will provide all members of our community with the opportunity to register their opinions about the various options.”
The focus groups are part of the administration’s efforts to select a replacement for GW’s nearly century-old Colonials moniker after the Board of Trustees voted to retire the nickname last year following years of pressure from students who said it glorified colonialism. Officials plan to select a moniker by the 2023-24 academic year after releasing a set of principles to steer student feedback last month and ruling out the Hippos in the same announcement, which has become GW’s unofficial mascot since the 1996 installation of the “River Horse” statue outside Lisner Auditorium.
Eight students attended a focus group survey for undergraduate students Wednesday, according to the recording. Students said the focus groups took place at the Behavioral Laboratory on the third floor of Duquès Hall. Alongside officials from Yes& Lipman Hearne, eight students were seen leaving the Behavioral Laboratory Thursday afternoon, and six were seen leaving Thursday night.
Officials randomly selected the students in the undergraduate focus groups, according to an email from Dean of Students Colette Coleman to selected students, which was obtained by The Hatchet. Coleman said in the email that participants would receive a $125 Amazon gift card as an “honorarium,” and students said officials catered the meetings with food from Panera Bread.
“Your insight is vital to informing future decisions about the new moniker,” Coleman said. “It is critically important that we hear your voice.”
Officials hired Sullivan – a New York-based consulting firm specializing in higher education – to lead the moniker selection process after a “competitive” bidding period, according to a University release issued in September. Coleman said officials are working with Yes& Lipman Hearne to facilitate the private surveys but did not mention in the email how Sullivan contributed to the focus groups.
After the undergraduate meetings Wednesday and Thursday afternoon, participants said officials did not ask their opinion on the Fogriders and Foghoppers monikers. One student in the Wednesday evening undergraduate student focus group said participants sharply criticized those two nicknames, saying The Fog was the only fog-based moniker variant that “made sense.”
“They were so unpopular,” one of the graduate students said in an interview after a Thursday focus group session.
Students at Thursday’s graduate survey said officials told them they plan to speak with alumni next.
Donna Van De Water, the group facilitator at the undergraduate focus group Wednesday and the chief operating officer at Yes& Lipman Hearne, said participants would be asked to grade each moniker on how “tenacious,” “electric” and “open” they are, according to the meeting recording.
“We all come from different places and have different experiences, and that’s why we wanted to bring a group together because people have different perspectives on the monikers that we’re going to be talking about,” Van De Water said in the meeting.
One participant in the Wednesday evening focus group for undergraduate students said the Behavioral Laboratory where the focus groups took place contained a one-way mirror. They said officials from the firm watched the survey from behind the mirror in the lab.
They said no students in that group objected to The Fog, which was the most popular nickname among the options that Van De Water presented to the focus group.
“The main proponent of The Fog was that it connected the community of Foggy Bottom as a whole and our identity geographically into the school’s moniker,” the student said. “And everyone there thought that made sense, and out of the 15, that was the only plausible option.”
One participant in the Thursday focus group for undergraduate students said while rating the monikers, The Fog “scored pretty low” among students in their focus group. They said Revolutionaries, Monumentals and Sentinels were the most popular options in their focus group, with participants rating Revolutionaries the “highest.”
They added that there was a “generational gap” between the focus group facilitators and students, which could lead to a disconnect in the facilitators’ understanding of students’ opinions.
“Most of the students, I think, would rather go with a funny moniker than one that actually, like, relates to the school,” they said. “And they were completely taken off guard by that.”

This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that students were asked to consider Continentals as an idea for GW’s next moniker. The list of options did not include Continentals. We regret this error. This post has also been updated to include an additional interview with an undergraduate student who participated in the Thursday undergraduate focus group.

Michał Wawrykiewicz, a legal and political analyst and social activist in Poland, said the Polish government has been slowly chipping away at fundamental judiciary systems in the country, causing concern for legal practitioners and the civilian population at large.
A Polish attorney specializing in constitutional and European law spoke about the challenges facing the Polish democracy Wednesday.
Michał Wawrykiewicz, a legal and political analyst and social activist in Poland, said the Polish government has been slowly chipping away at democratic judiciary systems in the country, causing concern for legal practitioners and the civilian population at large. The Elliott School of International Affairs’ Illiberalism Studies Program organized the hybrid event at the Elliott School, which was moderated by Marlene Laruelle, the director of the program.
Wawrykiewicz said Poland made strides in democratizing the country in the decades following its years of communist rule, which ended in 1989. Wawrykiewicz said the political changes that occurred between 1989 and 2014, including the entrance of Poland into the European Union, represented Poland’s commitment to Western democratic political philosophies and systems, namely an independent judiciary.
“For the next 26 years, we have been building democracy, all the institutions, all the fuses of democracy – independent prosecutor’s office, an independent judiciary, independent supreme court, constitutional courts,” Wawrykiewicz said. “As I said, all the fuses that protect us, theoretically protect us from nationalists, from autocracy.”
Wawrykiewicz said Poland’s commitments to democracy began to wane in 2015 when Polish voters elected the conservative Law and Justice party to power in parliament. Led by key figures like party chairman Jarosław Kaczyński, Wawrykiewicz said the party is an example of autocrats coming to power using “democratic mechanisms.”
Wawrykiewicz said the party gained traction because of a combination of populist propaganda, which consisted of nationalist advertising campaigns in Polish media, growing anti-European sentiment in Poland and the lack of a quick response to the autocratic trends by the Polish political and civilian world.
“If you have the first symptoms of an attack on constitutional institutions, you have to react swiftly or firmly, quickly,” Wawrykiewicz said. “You cannot wait.”
Wawrykiewicz said the party made shifts in political institutions consisting of assaults on the constitutional bodies of Poland, reforms to the prosecutor’s office, increased propaganda in public television and radio and changes to the electoral system.
Wawrykiewicz said the party’s changes to the Polish judiciary system, which include the 2017 legislative actions that gave control of the judiciary to part of the Polish parliament by granting them the authority to dismiss and appoint judges at will and to punish sitting judges, are all part of an effort to protect its position in the government.
He said the Polish government weaponized the war in Ukraine to draw attention away from the rising autocracy in Poland on the world stage. Wawrykiewicz said the ruling Law and Justice party capitalized on the war in Ukraine to “forget” about their concerns regarding Poland’s democracy.
Wawrykiewicz added that the people of Poland are actively challenging the government by organizing protests outside of various Polish courts. He said this resistance continues to play an instrumental role in reversing these political changes.
“The process of restoration will be very difficult and that’s why we are already preparing it, not as political opposition but as a civil society and a legal community,” Wawrykiewicz said.

Former GW Athletics Director Patrick Nero resigned in December 2017, a move that an athletics department spokesperson said wasn't related to a pay discrimination lawsuit filed against GW earlier that year.
A dueling pair of lawsuit filings have revitalized the battle over a 2017 pay discrimination suit against GW as the University looks to quash allegations that it deprived an athletics department employee of fair pay on the basis of sex.
In a 44-page motion filed Friday, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said the University failed to argue a “legitimate” and “nondiscriminatory” reason for its previous conduct toward Sara Williams, the former executive assistant to the athletics director, in their November motion for a summary judgment denying the claims. An earlier November motion by GW lawyers rejected Williams’ claims, saying her compensation was determined fairly.
Both motions ask District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to rule in their favor without a trial.
The EEOC alleges GW paid Michael Aresco – a former “special assistant” in the athletics department – nearly twice Williams’ salary for jobs with equal in work, and the University misrepresented the extent of Williams’ and Aresco’s responsibilities to justify what the commission alleges is sex-based discrimination.
“Sex bias in the Athletics Department resulted in devaluing Williams, despite her skill, qualification and responsibility, by characterizing and treating her like an office assistant,” the commission’s motion states.
The EEOC’s motion states Williams began working under former Athletics Director Patrick Nero in 2014 for about $40,000 a year, a position where she managed three department budgets and contracted administration, product management and human resources. Two years after hiring Williams, Nero hired Aresco as a “special assistant” and planned to give him Williams’ responsibilities but for a salary of $77,000, according to the filing.
In their own November motion, GW refuted claims that the salaries were disproportionate and argued there is “no dispute” that Aresco’s job required “substantially greater” skill, effort and responsibility than Williams’ job, which GW claims accounted for the higher salary. The University’s motion claims Williams’ work was “primarily clerical,” and she exercised no planning or oversight over athletics department budgets.
“Simply put, Williams worked as the assistant to the athletics director, while Aresco worked as an assistant athletics director,” GW’s November motion states.
GW claimed Nero and other officials involved in setting Aresco’s salary defended his pay because it was a “lateral” move from his former position in their November motion. Aresco started working in the athletics department for the first time as an administrator before being hired for the special assistant position, according to the 2017 EEOC complaint in District Court.
But the EEOC’s motion last week alleges that Human Resources Partner Kaithlyn Kayer concluded Aresco’s pay was too high for the position and signed off on it anyway because she knew Nero was set on that amount. Officials did not consider raising Williams’ pay after deciding on Aresco’s “inflated” salary despite their similar job descriptions, the motion states.
“That does not explain why, after [GW] decided to pay Aresco $77,000 per year to perform work equal to Williams, [the] defendant did not increase Williams’ pay in any amount so that she received equal pay for equal work,” the motion states.
The motion alleges Nero tried to “eliminate” Williams’ position once Aresco was hired, redirecting “high profile” jobs to Aresco to justify his higher pay – an effort that was “unsuccessful” because Williams would have to take over tasks that he lacked the understanding to complete.
Nero resigned in December 2017 after leading the athletics department for almost seven years, a choice that wasn’t related to the lawsuit, athletics department spokesman Brian Sereno said at the time. A year later, Nero came under fire for allegedly engaging in “strange” social relationships with students, giving certain athletes preferential treatment and drinking excessive alcohol on trips with staff members in the athletics department, according to a 2018 Deadspin article.
The department’s finance director testified she was “hand-holding” Aresco during budget-related tasks. GW said Aresco spearheaded responsibilities like the management of a Nike contract and a plan to decrease GW’s athletics budget but some were actually executed by Williams, according to the EEOC’s motion.
EEOC claims that under Aresco’s watch, one employee went without pay for more than a month.
“Aresco did not have the skills necessary to do the work, did not make sufficient effort to learn how to do the work and did not accept responsibility for completing the work,” their motion states.
GW alleges three days before Williams filed her initial 2017 complaint with the EEOC, she was reprimanded by Nero for “breaching confidentiality” and “spreading a rumor” about an opposing assistant basketball coach’s alleged infidelity.
In their response, the commission makes no mention of the specific incident but alleges Nero accused her of “breaching confidentiality” at one point to “force her out” and maintained “concerns” about Williams’ discretion since her hiring.
The motion states once a male joined the department and did administrative work, GW treated and valued that work not as clerical, but as “high-level” support provided by an “advisor” or “liaison.” Later that year, Williams quit after realizing the University would not stop or remedy the “disparate pay” and “sex discrimination” in the department, the motion states.
“The undisputed material facts show that defendant engaged in discriminatory pay practices and deprived Williams of equal employment opportunity in violation of Title VII,” the motion states.

Students who were at Hill Country last Wednesday were in for perhaps the most #OnlyAtGW moment of 2023. They found themselves dancing to classic karaoke anthems with George Santos, a Republican New York representative in Congress, former drag queen, the subject of a criminal fraud investigation in Brazil and a serial liar. It seems like every headline uncovers another lie Santos has told, ranging from his family’s ties to the Holocaust and 9/11 to basic resume credentials like his education and employment history. The endless stream of lies about the new congressman prompts the question – how did we let this happen?
Santos was elected before the mainstream media picked apart his phony resume, largely due to the decline in local newspaper readership. The North Shore Leader, a local Long Island newspaper, broke the story about Santos’ false claims of an $11 million net worth two months before his election in September. But despite their reporting, the story wasn’t picked up until the New York Times covered it a month after the election in December. The disparity between the national reaction to the North Shore Leader’s and the New York Times’ coverage exemplifies the nationwide information drain from local communities.
As students at such a politically active institution living within a media climate of growing polarization, we must pay attention to our local newspapers instead of solely focusing on spectacles that larger media outlets publish. In doing so, we can better understand news within our communities, evaluate political candidates and hold them accountable for their actions in positions of power for the sake of avoiding another situation like Santos’ election.
The future of local newspapers casts a dark shadow on the prospects of democracy. Over the past 20 years, at least 2,500 local newspapers have gone out of business, according to a Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism study. The result has left gaping holes in news coverage within local communities across the country. Larger new sources are stretched too thin to react to local news stories with the same level of speed and coverage as the publications in those communities – the New York Times’ delay to the Santos beat proves it. They don’t have the local community ties that the North Shore Leader’s owner Grant Lally said led the newspaper to Santos’ lie-ridden resume.
Instead, mainstream media has turned their sights to nationwide controversies to capitalize off the polarization of President Donald Trump’s spectacle of a presidency. Readers have followed in droves, taking their subscriptions to community newspapers with them. While local newspapers like the North Shore Leader still deliver critical reporting, few readers are left behind, which in turn drains funding and resources. National newspapers that ignore local publications don’t help either.
“Downstream, local and regional newspapers used to monitor the weekly papers more closely. So, something that popped in a weekly would be picked up very quickly. They’re not monitoring to the same extent,” Lally told The Hill last month.
We already know that Americans can fail at evaluating political candidates – especially given the recent rise in popularity of unfit and low-quality candidates who lack honesty and experience, like Herschel Walker, Mehmet Oz and Donald Trump. Media misinformation is a partial cause of this unfortunate trend. But receptiveness to local newspapers can be a catalyst for the spread of information, which will ensure experienced and honest elected officials.
Read your local newspapers, give credit to reporters and be aware of the conditions they’re facing. If your hometown’s local newspaper is lacking resources and funding, spread awareness within your community to neighbors and town leaders alike. Local newspapers deserve support during and after election season, and by keeping up with the news, we can help improve the quality of media information that those around us intake.

Dear Annie,
I got cut from the Esports team. I was getting really good at Fortnite and was catching dubs on a pretty regular basis. I guess I was getting a little too cocky and started to rub my fellow gamers the wrong way by doing Fortnite dances whenever I won or when someone on the team lost. I was asked to leave, and I’m trying to figure out my best next step and could use some advice.
Sincerely,
Your Friendly (and Repentant) Gamer Boi
Dear Your Friendly (and Repentant) Gamer Boi,
Do you want to compete with or against your Esports teammates? It’s one thing to celebrate beating bots by emoting in the game, but gloating in real life is a step too far. Forged in collaboration and competition, Fortnite’s community traverses the digital bounds.
Whether you are venturing to Tilted Towers in the Fortnite map solo or on a team, good sportsmanship holds the community together. Players say good game, or “gg” at the end of matches to foster mutual respect and humility, regardless of whether things go their way. When you “catch dubs,” you have to be polite about it.
Maura Kelly-Yuoh | Staff Cartoonist
With your Fortnite dance, you violated the “gg” code. Though you recognize dancing on a teammate’s defeat as self-centered, you realized it too late. The damage is done. To “res” your relationship with your brothers in (digital) arms, you have to take a second to reflect before apologizing.
Ask yourself why you joined GW’s Esports community in the first place. Video gaming could be done in solitude, but people join teams to share positive experiences with fellow gamers and make friends. Especially on a college campus – where life can be lonely and stressful – a social group with shared interests may bring a feeling of home.
Why put in the effort to make friends if you were just going to blow it anyway with poor sportsmanship? Podium placements change, but friendships do not have to follow the same path. You are not really catching “dubs” if you are doing it alone.
After ample time to reflect, focus on crafting the ultimate apology. Wait until sufficient time has passed. The game bled into real life, and Esports teammates need a cooling-off period. With time, they may be more receptive to your ultimate apology.
Acknowledge you were a source of frustration for your teammates. Share your intent to play with your teammates, not laugh at their losses. Promise to keep celebrations of victory in the game instead of real life, extending sportsmanship through “gg.”
If your teammates refuse to let you take a seat on the Battle Bus again, take up another hobby. I recommend crocheting as a suitable pivot hobby from Fortnite because you can still use your hands to perform deft, quick movements with a needle instead of a joystick. Since crocheting is an individual pastime, you’ll face no external competition. As you work on a solitary activity, you can practice better sportsmanship by being easy on yourself when a project goes awry. If you make a scarf that’s too thin to keep you warm, say the artistic equivalent of “gg” – good try – and move on.
It’s important to celebrate your triumphs, but you have to respect your teammates. You could just as easily take the L next round, and you would want people treating you kindly in your loss. People are more than bots, and a long-lasting connection with your teammates is the endgame.
Stay humble,
Annie <3

The Professional Ethics and Academic Freedom Committee will present recommended changes to the Faculty Organization Plan.
Faculty senators will vote on proposed changes to the Faculty Organization Plan during the Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
The Professional Ethics and Academic Freedom Committee will present recommended changes to the plan, like instituting procedures for determining whether Faculty Assembly meetings are held virtually or in a hybrid format, updating the official titles of administrators and incorporating gender-neutral language into the document. The committee’s resolution decreases the number of faculty needed to call a special meeting of the Faculty Assembly to 10 percent of the Faculty Assembly from 50 or more members.
The changes come after the senate voted to send a resolution on proposed changes to the plan, like the number of faculty needed to call a special meeting, back to the committee in May until a task force could revise the changes and present the revisions to the senate again.
The resolution states that the University President – or in the president’s absence, the Provost – in consultation with the chair of the Executive Committee, can determine if any regular or special meeting of the Faculty Assembly is held virtually or in a hybrid format. The Executive Committee chair can consult with the president to decide the format of regular or special senate meetings, according to the resolution.
The resolution also strikes any gendered references to positions in the senate, like “chairman,” from the faculty organization plan.
Pam Norris, the vice provost for research, will also present an annual report on research. Last years’ annual report detailed federal research funding expenditures in Fiscal Year 2021 and announced a new research platform, which allowed faculty to better track research proposals and awards.
The senate will also vote to approve a nominating committee to choose the 2023-24 senate executive committee.
Kim Roddis, a professor of environmental and civil engineering, will also request senate consent to modify the School of Engineering and Applied Science senate membership terms.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton and Provost Chris Bracey will present reports to the senate. Jim Tielsch, the chair of the executive committee, will also deliver a report from the executive committee to the senate.

Last week, officials sent an additional email to residents, stating the 16 communal bathrooms on every floor would be deep-cleaned twice per day.
Officials said they will begin cleaning Thurston Hall’s community bathrooms more frequently after students submitted complaints about the building’s dirtiness following their return from winter break.
KC Costanzo, the customer engagement and service enhancement associate for the Division of Safety and Facilities, sent an email to Thurston residents Wednesday issuing an apology for “uneven” housekeeping, saying they will task additional staff, like managers and a special supervisor, to oversee the cleanliness of the building’s bathrooms. Officials said they will implement an extra midday shift to maintain their new “proactive” system after students reported a lack of cleaning in the bathrooms this year.
Last week, officials sent an additional email to residents, stating the sixteen communal bathrooms on every floor would be deep-cleaned twice per day and students should immediately report any observed discrepancies to stay on top of “potential issues.”
More than a dozen students said they have noticed a lack of sanitation in Thurston’s bathrooms and study spaces, including hair-covered walls and sinks, toilets clogged for days at a time, buildup around sinks and showers, overflowing trash cans and empty toilet paper and towel dispensers. Students said they are often responsible for cleaning up in the communal bathrooms.
Nora Butter, a freshman fifth-floor resident, said prior to the email sent out last week, she had not seen any workers cleaning the bathrooms on her floor since the start of the semester. She said there was no toilet paper in the bathrooms for at least a week and the bathroom floor accumulated garbage because of trash can overflow.
Thurston and Mitchell halls are the only two residence halls on campus with communal bathrooms, according to the University website.
“People still don’t know how to plunge or flush toilets which is baffling to me,” Butter said. “Even if I was showering in there, I still wouldn’t feel fully clean just because of how gross the bathroom was.”
Scarlett Metts, a freshman second-floor resident, said since she received the email from officials last week, she has seen the custodial staff cleaning bathrooms but has not noticed a difference in the cleanliness. Metts added that the restocking of toilet paper has been “better,” but the toilets have remained “disgusting.”
“I don’t know if it’s that they’re not cleaning them or if it’s just that the people who live here immediately mess it up,” Metts said.
Metts also said she thought the sanitation in Thurston is worse than in other halls because the bathrooms are communal. She said she noticed a trend in the “disrespect” of residents toward the bathrooms because they do not bear as much responsibility for cleaning them.
“When you have your own bathroom, you want to clean it because you actively have to live with it every day,” Metts said. “When you have a communal bathroom, and it’s a shared space and you have other people cleaning it for you, then you feel like you can just do it.”
Grace Butler, a freshman second-floor resident, said she has noticed “ups and downs” living in Thurston from the combination of the building’s novel amenities and its sparse cleaning. She said she notices some staff members doing an “amazing” job cleaning the bathrooms while others just wipe down the bathrooms, which sometimes is “not enough.”
“A lot of the study spaces and hangout things you just don’t get in other buildings, and I wouldn’t want to trade that,” Butler said. “But I think that some of the cleanliness concerns we can’t control. If we had our own bathroom with the suite we could clean it up, but I’m not gonna go into communal bathrooms and clean them all the time.”

Each dish comes with three scoops, so I opted to mix the tastes with one for each flavor. When first presented, the dessert was split between three oval-shaped rounds of thick cream that were already in the process of melting.
Found on the edge of La Cosecha food hall in Union Market, Destino is a newly rebranded restaurant serving up modern Mexican fare with a nod to classic flavors.
Praised for its energetic ambiance and modern cuisine, Destino, formerly known as Las Gemelas Cocina Mexicana until December 2021, resembles an up-and-coming restaurant that celebrates Mexican culture and reinforces that sense of community among not just those who share Mexican heritage but individuals simply looking for Mexican culture and cuisine. This slice of Mexico is served on a platter in La Cosecha, a culinary market representing a mix of eateries celebrating Latin American culture and conversation within Union Market.
Chef Robert Aikens revamps the menu on a seasonable basis to create traditional Mexican cuisine dishes while incorporating modern Mexican flavors and cuisines, like more plant-forward dishes. Last winter, Aikens switched from serving ceviches, toasts and lighter dishes to heartier, more comforting menu options to warm up his guests with stuffed tamales and glazed pork belly.
To provide customers with a memorable experience, Destino occasionally hosts live mariachi bands that spice up the social environment. This restaurant has already drawn heavy attraction from the public due to the immense creativity of the dishes offered. Without access to a fryer or gas stove, the kitchen staff are encouraged to innovate with the available equipment, like a plancha – a Spanish griddle – induction stoves, and more. And if that isn’t enough, the open bar sells alcohol produced directly in Mexico City and the Baja Peninsula.
Upon entering the La Cosecha food hall, the entire lighting of the Destino is warm yellow, furnished with attention to detail from mellow lamps to vintage mirrors, embracing a soft-toned color palette that remained consistent with the all-white tables, chairs and tableware.
The outside perimeter of the restaurant is lined with tables to seat four to six individuals in the dining room and outside patio. The open bar is located directly in the center of the room surrounded by dining tables.
Unlike neighboring Mexican restaurants, Destino not only offers traditional Mexican menu options, like quesadillas, enchiladas and tamales, but it also creates inventive desserts incorporating chile, ginger, and Oaxacan chocolate. By including traditional flavors of cumin and cilantro while preserving the classic originality of American desserts, Destino’s post-meal indulgences are all excellent options.
Offered on their dessert menu, the four dishes are ancho con chocolate ($12), churro paris-brest ($12), sorbete ($8) and sugar and spice ($11). I ordered the sorbete ($8), which was coated with the rich flavor of sweet milk. The sorbete looked intriguing, described as “deconstructed Oaxacan chocolate,” which lured me in upon first glance. The menu features three flavors, which include almond and cinnamon with coconut in addition to the Oaxacan chocolate. Each dish comes with three scoops, so I opted to mix the tastes with one for each flavor.
When first presented, the dessert was split between three oval-shaped rounds of thick cream that were already in the process of melting. The dark chocolate sorbet had a deep, rich flavor similar to melted brownie batter. It included hints of roasted cacao that produced a bitter, caffeinated taste followed by the slightly spicy zest of sweet chile. Both flavors combined create a nutty, earthy blend that pulled away from the richness of the chocolate itself. The dish would have been completed with flakes of chocolate pieces to add textural contrast.
The almond sorbete was soft and buttery, highlighting the roast of the nut. It smelled similar to the syrupy sweetness of almonds in Amaretto as hints of maple were detectable within the delectable mush. Crunchy flakes of almonds broke up the velvety flavor, and the almondy shavings of goodness introduced a more savory flavor profile.
Although the coconut flavor was a bit overpowering in the cinnamon and coconut-flavored sorbete, the tropical ambiance and creamy texture of the dish proved to be a redeeming feature. Flecks of cinnamon dotted the dish, which interrupted the fruity, milky palate of the coconut. Hints of melted butter and brown sugar combined to make this flavor my favorite.
The sorbete intertwined classic Mexican flavors of chile and Oaxacan chocolate in a modern form of sorbete, an intriguing and delicious touch. Unlike other restaurants, Destino prides itself on a mix of traditional and modern flavors, displayed especially through the savory and sweet profiles of the dessert items. If you are interested in embarking on a quick but exciting adventure away from campus, be sure to make a pit stop at Destino when visiting Union Market.

Biden meets guests in the East Room of the White House for a Lunar New Year celebration Thursday. 
During the past week in Washington, The Hatchet attended the White House’s first-ever Lunar New Year celebration and caught members of the press peppering President Joe Biden with questions on the South Lawn.
At the Lunar New Year celebration in the East Room of the White House Thursday, Biden greeted a crowd that included Elaine Tso, the CEO of Asian Services in Action, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Olympic figure skater Nathan Chen. During his address, he offered remarks of condolences and solidarity in response to the shooting in Monterey Park, California, where 11 people were killed and nine were injured at a ballroom hours after a Lunar New Year celebration.
Four days later, Biden answered questions on the South Lawn Monday about his plans to meet with Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, raise the debt ceiling and travel to Europe for the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

GW Palooza's 25 ambassadors helped craft the events to better fit the schedules of busy students.
Senior Kate Carpenter won’t let the weather ruin her party – not this time.
Carpenter – a political communications major from Stillwater, Oklahoma and the former vice president of the Student Association – founded last year’s Presidents Weekend Palooza, a weekend-long series of spirit events that will return for its second year Friday, now dubbed GW Palooza. Despite freezing temperatures set to dip into the teens, the three-day celebration will feature eight events, half outdoors.
But after a surprise sequence of warm, sunny days forced Carpenter to cancel a skating event when the ice rink melted during President’s Day Weekend last year, she says the show must go on this time around. And just in case the weather is too harsh to bear, she and her team have learned from the hard-learned lessons of yesteryear to develop backup plans with reserved space in the University Student Center to ensure the palooza’s eight free events go uninterrupted.
“We don’t care if it’s cold,” she said in an interview. “We just want to party.”
Carpenter is serving as the executive director of GW Palooza, which is rolling out brand-new events to rally student engagement and school pride. Among them, GW Crown will make its debut Saturday as a spoof pageant featuring more than a dozen performers representing their student organizations. She and her team are also welcoming students back to last year’s popular outdoor events, like a banner-making competition in Kogan Plaza and two pre-basketball game tailgates in the green lot on 22nd Street next to GW Police Department headquarters.
More than two dozen student coordinators are readying the events, anchored by GW basketball games on Saturday and Sunday. Carpenter said she is particularly excited to host the GARMY – or George’s Army – Party Tailgate Saturday afternoon before the men’s basketball homecoming game against A-10 foe Duquesne.
Carpenter said the tailgate will feature a bounce house, a performance from student DJ M-SOZ, unlimited pizza, a sponsorship by Insomnia Cookies and various backyard sports.
“It was an impulse buy just yesterday to get a bouncy house,” Carpenter said. “We were just going to do a normal tailgate in the alley, and then things started to unravel just in the past week. And we’re like ‘You know what? Bouncy house. You know what? Student DJ.’”
For GW basketball and fans alike – the weekend is all about competition. The events will kick off Friday with a banner-making contest for members of student organizations and a dodgeball tournament for members of campus fraternities and sororities. Carpenter said a GW Palooza committee with “secret” members will present a President of the Weekend award to one enthusiastic student at Sunday’s women’s basketball game against George Mason. The chosen student will win a trophy and $200 to give to a student organization.
Carpenter said the team of 25 volunteers she’s leading, most of whom helped organize the inaugural celebration in 2022, crafted the events to better fit the schedules of busy students this year. She said they pushed up GW Palooza before President’s Day weekend so GW community members could enjoy the festivities when more students are in town, and each event will wrap up by 7 p.m. to avoid disrupting students’ weekend-night plans.
“We realized that students don’t want to be on campus on a Friday night at 8 to 9 p.m.,” Carpenter said. “So everything will be done by 7 p.m. both nights, which we feel really, really confident about because that gives students an opportunity to have something to do on their off day but also not having to sacrifice their nights.”
The palooza is perhaps the signature event of a University-wide effort to build school spirit as GW returns from pandemic-induced lethargy, picks a new moniker and works to address the widespread critique that students lack GW pride. Carpenter hopes the combination of student events with basketball games, where attendance has spiked since last year, will help bolster community enthusiasm for years to come.
Other organizers, like senior and GW Palooza Assistant Director Shaelyn McCarthy, said they’re proud to be part of an effort to build community among all students, whether they be die-hard Colonials basketball fans or students simply searching for some bustle on a Saturday afternoon.
“It’s just offering extra opportunity for students who might have a little bit more difficulty getting that push to go to a basketball game,” McCarthy said in an interview. “This is that push to get them out into the community and try new things.”
McCarthy, who has worked on the Mount Vernon Campus for four years as an employee of the Office of Student Life, said she focused on making the palooza accessible to Vern residents. McCarthy said she helped organize the Vexapalooza, a mini event where organizers will distribute Vern-exclusive stickers and shirts at the Vern’s quad while pushing students to attend the Foggy Bottom Campus events.
“I knew that we had to target that community and make sure that they were getting as great of a palooza experience as students who are off of the Vern,” she said.
Senior Chris Johnson, GW Palooza’s internal operations director in charge of managing much of the group’s logistics, said while officials have been generous with their support in helping to plan and provide spaces for the events, the palooza is “run by students, for students.”
“I think having students plan events that we think students would be interested in helps students come out and show their school spirit and show the pride of being part of the GW community,” Johnson said.
