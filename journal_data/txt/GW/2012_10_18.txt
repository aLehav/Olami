A high-end District retail developer is beginning a 14-month project to inject “new life” into Foggy Bottom’s oldest hotel, the company’s president said Wednesday.
ABDO Development laid out an extensive plan to transform the century-old Allen Lee Hotel into an upscale restaurant and hotel, six years after purchasing the worn-down property at 23rd and F streets.
President and CEO Jim Abdo presented the company’s plan for the five-story, white brick building with a peeling exterior at a neighborhood meeting Wednesday.
“We have been wanting to get to this building to upgrade it to give it a new lease on life,” Abdo said. “We’re not about knocking buildings down, we’re about giving them new life.”
The company, which has transformed dozens of historic buildings in D.C. into luxurious venues, bought the hotel for $3.6 million and has sat idle on the project until now.
The company plans to gut the inside and upgrade the outside so it doesn’t “stand out like the sore thumb” it is now, Abdo said.
He said he could not yet provide the estimated cost or more details of the design.
“We just know we want to upgrade this facility, provide a much better hotel for this community and much better on-site amenities than what are available today,” he added.
The hotel’s cheap rates – as low as $60 per night, according to some hostel websites – would rise to about $200 per room. Abdo said the company would likely downsize the number of rooms from 80, but each unit would feature more amenities, like private bathrooms.
The hotel also helps house  clients from My Sister’s Place, an organization that assists women affected by domestic abuse.
Pam McNeil, operations director for My Sister’s Place, said the organization has not been advised of any specific changes for the women who stay at the hotel.
“Working with folks at the Allen Lee, as far as we know, won’t be a change in the kind of services we provide there,” McNeil said.
Abdo said the shelter’s victims receive a government stipend to stay in the hotel as a safe haven, and he said the site will continue to accept any paying resident.
News broke of the project last month, when the company applied for a liquor license with the city’s Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration.
William Hager, the record and data management supervisor at ABRA, said the liquor license was approved Oct. 9.
The Allen Lee is one of the largest Foggy Bottom properties that GW has not touched, though the hotel has fielded several requests to partner in the last few decades.
Alicia Knight, senior associate vice president for operations at the University, said last week that there have been “no conversations” about a partnership with ABDO over the Allen Lee. She declined to comment on the company’s presentation after the local meeting.
The University has not attempted to purchase the hotel in the last decade, but made multiple offers up until the 1990s.
Steve Timlin, a long-time resident of Foggy Bottom, said the development would be in the neighborhood’s best interest.
Timlin said he scoped out the hotel in the 1990s as a potential stay for guests, but decided, “I would not take anyone in that place.”
“I’m glad to hear someone will improve the Allen Lee,” he added. “If the hotel could be improved, I would go in again.”

Charlie Berardesco’s 30-year legal career was born at the GW Law School. And when he dies, a $3 million chunk of his multimillion-dollar estate will go back into the school to fund scholarships and programs.
The 54-year-old alumnus is part of a growing pool of donors earmarking GW in their wills – initiating an awkward waiting game for gifts that will pad the University’s endowment when they die.
“It’s an old lawyers’ joke about giving money estates. When the estate matures, then the money flows,” said Berardesco, whose gift was announced at a law school banquet this month. “That’s what would happen when I pass away.”
The amount of money the University pulled in from these gifts, called estate or planned gifts, grew by 56 percent last fiscal year, amassing $23.5 million from 81 donations that will be tucked away for years or even decades.
These gifts often make up some of GW’s heaviest money loads. Out of the 19 gifts valued over $1 million last year, eight were planned estate gifts.
The University’s planned giving program – where donors can request in their wills that money for scholarships, academics or research go to GW – isn’t new. GW has pushed the option since the 1980s, but it rapidly gained popularity in the past year, accounting for one-fifth of last year’s entire fundraising haul.
It has the potential to have its greatest impact over the next two decades as the baby boomer population fades away, creating a “huge opportunity for gift planning,” Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations Mike Morsberger said.
“Planned gifts are often among the largest that the university receives,” Morsberger said in an email. “Planned giving, where the gift won’t come to fruition during their lifetime, takes away the constraints of current (and projected) living expenses.”
In all, GW is sitting on $156.4 million worth of 574 planned gifts – but the amount could be more, Morsberger said, since only about 20 percent of planned donors notify the University.
Berardesco’s case is unique. The D.C.-based lawyer does not have children, and the Defense of Marriage Act prevents him from getting a tax break if he were to leave all of his money behind for his husband – so he’s splitting the difference between GW and his undergraduate alma mater Duke University.
“It’s not very complicated. I want to pay as few taxes as possible, and I want my schools to be taken care of,” he said, crediting the law school’s grants and scholarships for helping him stay to earn his degree.
About $1 million will fund student scholarships, and $2 million will be up to the law school to spend, because, “I don’t know by the time I die what the appropriate way for the money to be spent [is],” Berardesco, general counsel for the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, said.
The cause made sense for Berardesco, too, he said. He said he was drawn to give by GW Law School Dean Paul Schiff Berman’s vision to boost financial aid and increase personalized learning tracks.
“I’m one of the bizarre guys who loved going to law school,” he said. “I’m not a big believer of naming buildings. I have a terrible last name, so why would you want to name a building after me? It’s much more that the school uses its money as it needed.”
For the University, it’s a bit more complicated.
GW, and the law school specifically, is seeking planned gifts to build up a substantial cash base – though it would materialize years or decades down the line. For instance, the University won’t see any of Berardesco’s $3 million gift until he dies, although he gives annually on top of his pledged donation.
The University also is relying on these donors to not change their minds, and it calculates gift money on the assumption that their estates won’t shrink.
But Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz said in August that it’s worth the wait. The University typically fixes the payout to fund the University’s operations at about 5 percent of the endowment each year.
He said that predictability eases any worries about the University’s year-to-year financial state, allowing him to focus on the big-picture impact that planned gifts will have.
The University’s endowment sat at about $1.3 billion last fiscal year, on par with the year before. GW’s total wealth has grown five-fold over the last two decades, as the University increasingly prioritizes fundraising and cost-cutting strategies while planning ambitious capital projects like the $275 million Science and Engineering Hall, $16 million Gelman Library renovations and $75 million School of Public Health and Health Services building.
The promise of funds coming in allows GW to expand its ability to pay for new faculty positions and internal research dollars, he said.
“This actually gives a way of leveraging the revenue you have – you just don’t know the timing of it, but that doesn’t bother me at all,” Katz said. “If you do enough of those kinds of gifts, or if you do enough planned giving, it really does help catapult the institution.”
The law school, for instance, is relying on the momentum of planned estate gifts to eventually double its endowment from $130 million to $260 million, in line with the University’s goal to increase financial aid and rely less on tuition to operate.
Rich Collins, associate vice president for law development, said he’s pinning his hopes on “the great transfer of wealth” that will take place when wealthy baby boomers not only leave money to their children, but also to their schools. A Boston College report estimated that $41 trillion will be passed on from one generation to the next between 1998 and 2052.
Collins said the law school has been promoting planned estate giving for the last three or four years, but it has made more headway in the past year through word of mouth.
“The annual gifts are terrific, but the estate plans really go further to build, and that’s why places like Harvard are so well-endowed – centuries of gifts from people like Charlie,” Collins said.
The University has pumped up its fundraising efforts overall in recent years, bringing in a record $120 million last year to a traditionally tuition-dependent school.
GW will need to stockpile funds even more over the next 10 years, especially with a strategic plan calling for academic and research initiatives that relies on between $300 million and $400 million in fundraising.
Universities nationwide have been picking up on the power of planned estate gifts after the 2008 economic crisis caused many top donors to hold onto their pocketbooks, Rae Goldsmith, vice president of advancement resources for the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, said.
She said universities typically promote the option through sensitive one-on-one conversations and in direct mail.
“Fundraisers found it to be an effective approach, especially with a donor who wants to make a significant gift but wants to make sure they’re secure financially in their lifetime,” she said.

Geology lecturer Elli Pauli said the laundry list of cheating incidents in her classes – from collaborating on take-home exams to peeking at iPhones during tests – has reached a tipping point.
To combat what she calls an “epidemic,” she enlisted extra proctors to watch test takers and banned group exams last year – when the number of cheating, plagiarism and falsification reports at GW reached an all-time high of 145 cases.
Last year, professors brought 45 percent more cases to the Office of Academic Integrity than they did during the 2010-2011 academic year.
“I’m guessing the issue is this idea that you have so much pressure, and you have to get ahead at any cost,” Pauli said. “But it’s getting more rampant.”
While Pauli prefers to deal with instances of cheating herself by failing students on the assignments, more professors than ever are asking GW to step in and handle the cases, Tim Terpstra, the office’s director, said.
The rise was in part driven by the 55 graduate students caught cheating, a 16 percent jump from last year. Plagiarism, the most common type of academic integrity violation, made up just more than half of the cases – 8 percent fewer than during the 2010-2011 school year.
Cheating, which Terpstra describes as the “old-fashioned” copying off another student’s paper, made up about 16 percent of cases. The rest of the academic integrity violations include falsification, fabrication and facilitation of instances.
Professors are quick to Google suspicious phrases, and many also use online plagiarism checking software, like TurnItIn.com and SafeAssign, Terpstra said.
“I think professors take it more seriously now,” he said. “They’ve read in the newspapers and seen on the Internet different examples of cheating and plagiarism that take place at colleges and universities and the workplace.”
Eleven students charged with academic integrity violations last year were repeat offenders, the most ever. Terpstra said the trend could mean students aren’t learning from their mistakes, and that the office should “consider stronger sanctions, more preventative work to help these students.”
Terpstra added that he would continue to urge professors to encourage students to use the University’s free paper writing help service, the Writing Center, to seek help on papers and citations. He said he has noticed some of GW’s schools and departments made it a priority in the last year to root out cheating and plagiarism.
The GW School of Business, which brought in a new dean in 2010, saw a 4 percent increase in students caught cheating or plagiarizing last year. The school’s cheating cases represent about a quarter of GW’s total incidents – a rate that is disproportionate to its overall number of students.
“Sometimes it’s a new dean coming to town and they take it more seriously, or they hear horror stories on cheating. It does lend itself to a lot of gossip. It can sound like everyone’s doing it,” Terpstra said.
Neil Cohen, an associate professor of finance who sits on academic integrity panels, said talk about different cases is often “shrouded in secrecy” between students, professors and administrators even as cases increase.
He said even though watercooler talk sometimes revolves around academic integrity, mentions of the instances faculty meetings are rare. There should be more open discussion about violations and cases, especially as the rates go up, he said.
“We don’t have any procedure to notify our community that these meetings take place and what happens in them,” Cohen said.

With an escalating number of students found with fake IDs, the University is launching a campaign to warn them of the legal consequences.
The University Police Department has seen an increase in alcohol-related reports tied back to the use of fake IDs, UPD Chief Kevin Hay said, along with finding more fake IDs in wallets at the lost and found.
That spike prompted a joint effort by UPD and the Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education this fall to remind students that they could face disciplinary violations, police citations, fines or even arrest if caught with false identification.
“If your friends talk you into getting a fake ID, it could be more than just a college lark,” Hay said. “You could end up with something on your record that you don’t want to be there three years later.”
Sixteen students have been reported to GW’s disciplinary office so far this year for using false identification to buy alcohol or gain access into bars. Last academic year, a total of 84 students were referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities for the use or possession of false IDs – down from 109 students during the 2010-2011 year, Gabriel Slifka, the office’s director, said.
“Many incidents” of fake ID use by students are handled by the Metropolitan Police Department, potentially skewing the University’s statistics, because the department is not obligated to notify UPD, Hay said. Scenarios where UPD finds fake IDs in wallets at the lost and found are also not logged.
The campaign this fall will include information cards outlining University and city penalties of possessing fake IDs, as well as the potential health and legal risks of consuming alcohol, Hay said. Police will begin handing the cards out Sunday at the annual block party at the Eye Street Mall.
Students who are caught with fake IDs for the first time typically face disciplinary probation, Slifka said. But they could also be arrested or receive citations if MPD officers catch them.
D.C. law imposes a $300 fine and driving probation for fake IDs used for underage drinking.
The University is taking an “active role” in fighting fake ID use with D.C.’s Alcohol Beverage Regulation Administration, Hay said. UPD routinely shares information on which bars, clubs and liquor stores are known for dodging underage drinking laws with MPD and ABRA, sometimes leading to sting operations.
In September, three students were arrested in Columbia Plaza after purchasing alcohol with fake IDs, according to MPD reports. Hay said UPD was not involved.
The fake ID education effort will target the entire student body, Hay said.
“Students should be educated on the potential outcomes of using a fake ID, so that they understand the consequences they may face should they be caught,” Alexis Janda, CADE’s associate director, said.

The University is investing in a pair of hybrid graduate programs to support what many experts call the future format of cost-effective higher education.
For years, the University has offered hybrid graduate programs, which divide learning between online and in-classroom, in fields from dance to special education. But it selected two flagship hybrid programs last week – an executive masters of health services administration and a graduate certificate in LGBT health – to give $65,000 in special financial and training support.
“There’s good reason to think that we can do things in hybrid formats better than we could do [with] all online and all on campus,” Denis Cioffi, director of the Teaching & Learning Collaborative, the “center for teaching excellence” that selected the programs, said. “Especially if you look at the way these two programs are set up. They’re getting access to other faculty that we might not normally have access to.”
Like all programs that are mostly online, the hybrid format provides a “practical benefit” for GW, Cioffi said. The University can grow its base of tuition dollars without taking up space or adding to the city-regulated enrollment cap, part of the 2007 Campus Plan that limits the number of students who can enroll on the Foggy Bottom Campus.
Cioffi said that while the TLC has “a long-term plan for increasing programs and seeing, in the end, net [revenue] gain,” it does not have a fixed financial goal, instead focusing on ensuring the programs are educationally sound.
“We did create a detailed model that told us it makes financial sense (as well as educational sense) to go ahead with hybrid programs.  Once that decision was made, my focus changed to the educational aspect of the programs,” he said in an email, adding that he would continue to revisit the program’s financial impact once the program starts and attracts students.
A Pew Research Center report on the future of higher education this month showed that 60 percent of experts expect groundbreaking shifts at universities over the next 10 years, like increased reliance on hybrid courses.
Only four programs applied for conversion to hybrids, but Cioffi said he remains optimistic about the prospects of hybrid growth at GW.
Both programs will launch by next fall.
Leonard Friedman, the professor spearheading the health services administration hybrid program, said the program aimed to meet the healthcare industry’s tremendous need for individuals trained in top hospital positions.
While the industry employs about 300,000 people in these types of administrative roles, he said, only about two thirds have been educated for them.
Stephen Forssell, a part-time professor of psychology and head of the LGBT health program, said the graduate certificate would teach students about the physical and mental health needs of gay and lesbian patients, like information aobut HIV/AIDS, and would also touch on public policy issues, like helping partners earn hospital visitation rights.
“The healthcare system was not designed for gay people,” because of stigma and different health needs, Forssell said.
Forssell said a hybrid design suited the program’s “target market” of working professionals. The program requires just two weeks of in-classroom work in the District.
Cioffi similarly said the hybrid scheme would permit non-GW faculty to be a part of the programs.
While Forssell said the hybrid format likely will allow his program to lower tuition costs for students, Friedman said his would probably stay the same because faculty salaries would still produce high costs.
“The cost of our executive MHSA is comparable to similar programs across the country,” Friedman said.
The hybrid format is mostly used by executive level or graduate programs, seeing varying levels of interest.
Assistant professor Carl Leonard said the master of professional studies and graduate certificate in law firm management program he runs has seen “good, but not great” demand since it started three years ago in the College of Professional Studies.
He attributed the static enrollments – about 11 to 18 per class – to a lack of precedent for law firms to send employees back to school.

Head coach Terry Shaffer made no excuses for his young team, which finished 13th, of 17 teams, at the Donald Ross Intercollegiate Tournament early this week.
The course itself presented unique challenges – the par-70 6,718-yard course at Mimosa Hills Golf and Country Club in Morganton, N.C. was rain-drenched, and many of the holes were “tricky” and “hard to read,” Shaffer said. Still, GW’s leader refused to give his players a pass, but added that the team’s mental presence, a key aspect of golf competition, suffered over the two-day tournament.
“It’s hard to concentrate,” Shaffer said. “People don’t know that the first day of competition is about 10 hours straight.”
The style of the long format is a particular problem for a Colonial squad that fields a team with two sophomores and three freshmen. After graduating a number of standout seniors last year, the relatively inexperienced team is still adjusting to a new roster.
Still, Shaffer added, the new players have acclimated to both college life and to competing at the collegiate level, and he hopes that soon, their play will settle out and performances will improve.
“I really do feel that this young team will probably jell really well by the time spring comes around,” Shaffer said. “With our spring team, that’s our conference championship season – that’s when we really have to perform.”
The team was paced by one young member of the roster, sophomore Jack Persons, who shot an 8-over 218, landing him in a tie for 27th place. He came out of the gate well on the first day of competition Monday, tying for first in the first round with a 3-under 67 after a two-hour rain delay. In the shortened second round, Persons finished the day with an even-par score and ultimately fired a 5-over 75 in round two and a 6-over 76 in round three to reach his final rank.
Other high notes came from freshmen Steve Piela and Carlos Pena who shot a 17-over 227 to finish 55th and 21-over 231 to tie for 67th, respectively. It’s a good trend for a youthful team, Shaffer said – one that shows the valuable mentor relationships the Colonials have developed.
“The young men, both the sophomores and freshmen, will continue to improve and will be pretty solid as far as that goes,” Shaffer said. “I think the upperclassmen have helped a lot with the news kids coming up.”
The inclement weather that delayed the start of the competition and postponed the final four holes of round two for the Colonials to Tuesday morning played a factor across the entire competition. GW ultimately finished a 61-over-par 901 in three rounds of play. A key issue for the Colonials was their short game, Shaffer said, identifying it as the biggest area for improvement.
“I will tell you this, that the short game will improve, and guys were hitting greens in regulation, and doing some pretty good things with their ball game,” Shaffer said. “Nevertheless, the short game area does have to improve completely.”
Though the team returned to Foggy Bottom without the results its head coach wanted, he’s not pushing the panic button on the season of the reigning A-10 champions just year.
“I’m disappointed with today, I’m still high off the season, and I think we got a lot of good things ahead of us,” Shaffer said.

As the University sketches out its next 10 years of global expansion, it will set aside $5 to $15 million for new study abroad programs centered on work and research experience and more exchanges with foreign colleges.
The Office of Study Abroad will focus more on international research and internships, one of several changes to programs proposed in a draft of the University’s strategic plan released last week.
Director of the Office of Study Abroad Rob Hallworth said stressing extra-curricular experience would help set students apart when hunting for jobs because only a handful of affiliated programs offer internship options.
The globally focused plan also calls for saving a total of $9 million over the next 10 years by shedding partnerships with study abroad companies that rack up too many costs for students, cutting office expenses and “realigning” the programs’ price structures. Programs are already divided into six tiers ranging from $550 to $6,850 on top of GW’s regular tuition.
GW will look to add exchange programs in Brazil, India, China and Sub-Saharan Africa as well as programs tailored to international students, Hallworth said. It will also expand existing programs, but Hallworth said specifics had not yet been ironed out.
The funds, reserved tentatively in the draft of the strategic plan released last week, would also increase faculty abroad, offer more short-term programs and develop more courses that stress immersion, arts, culture and literature.
The office would push students to go on revamped GW programs and exchanges, he said, because “when a student participates in an exchange instead of a provider program, this reduces expenses to providers.” He added that exchange programs are also important for bringing foreign students to campus.
About 48 percent of students study abroad before they graduate, and Hallworth said adjustments to the program, particularly the focus on work experience, will help drive up that figure.
Institutions nationwide, including Northeastern University, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Rochester Institute of Technology have already honed in on providing international work experience to students abroad.
Karin Fischer, a senior reporter for the Chronicle of Higher Education who specializes on globalization, said universities that provide internships abroad are traditionally “more practically focused as opposed to liberal arts institutions.” She said GW’s efforts reflect a broader trend across higher education to pitch pricier classroom experiences abroad.
“It used to be the value of going overseas to get a cultural experience, the traditional study abroad experience,” Fischer said. “Now, a lot more students talk about going overseas as valuable to their career, providing experiences that help students abroad.”
Fischer pointed to a similar program at the University of Rhode Island that increased the number of students who went abroad.
“It’s a marketing strategy, a way to appeal to students” she said.
Most countries require students seeking internships outside of their classes to also have a worker’s visa, Fischer said, adding that some programs and universities help students with the additional process.

When Stephanie Snell tried to find information on campus about eating disorders, the closest thing she could find was an outdated nutritional pamphlet.
The senior, who studies exercise science with a concentration in dietetics, watched her friends struggle with eating disorders in high school. She started SPEAK GW, which had its first meeting this month, to spread awareness about eating disorders and maintaining positive body image.
“We want to keep people engaged, even if they don’t think it’s something they should learn more about,  kind of showing them, ‘This is relevant to you,’ ” Snell said.
SPEAK, which stands for Students Promoting Eating Disorder Awareness and Knowledge, started in 2002 as a research project at the University of Utah. Though the group began with just four students, it is in the process of expanding to other college campuses and has more than 85 members across the country.
Snell said eating disorders and body image issues are critical topics for college students because their high-stress environments can trigger or aggravate the conditions. Everything from a student’s relationships, to schoolwork to being away from home could be a factor.
About 95 percent of individuals with eating disorders are between the ages of 12 and 26, according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders.
The chapter plans to create strictly factual pamphlets that will compile useful information about eating disorders and related topics – not just for those seeking treatment, but also for concerned friends or those interested in learning more. It will also look to host presentations on the broad range of eating disorders and how to seek help.
“I think through information, people will be able to draw conclusions that it’s just not one person’s problem, but also they can see on paper that guys have it, girls have it, rich people, poor people, every color,” Snell said.
SPEAK GW’s faculty adviser, assistant professor of exercise science Amanda Visek, said one of the group’s most powerful assets is that it is completely student-run, which can make reaching out less intimidating for some students.
“It’s sort of this peer-to-peer education, so there’s opportunity for that mentorship, whereas students might be more reluctant to seek information from a faculty member or a helping professional like a counselor or therapist,” Visek said.
SPEAK GW has reached out to faculty and other campus organizations to work together on its mission, such as the University Counseling Center, which established an eating disorder counseling program in 2009.
Visek said administrators and groups on campus have been perceptive to the group’s initiative. She said SPEAK GW hopes to collaborate with the University Counseling Center and the Lerner Health and Wellness Center to serve as students’ first point of contact when seeking help or information.
Justine Reel, the faculty adviser for SPEAK’s founding Utah chapter, said though the group began as a research initiative, outreach quickly became one of the most important aspects of the organization.
“It’s always been about looking at promoting positive body image,” Reel said. “Anybody can benefit from health promotion and from having a positive body image, regardless of their shape, their size, their history, whether they have an eating disorder or not.”
Reel said that, while the group exists as a resource to anyone seeking information about eating disorders and body image, SPEAK’s multiple chapters can also help people find appropriate professional help when needed, both locally and nationally.

Freshman Day of Service has been a hallmark of University President Steven Knapp’s tenure, reflecting the goal to make community service an integral component of GW’s culture, and pushing students to engage with the city.
But the service day has also been criticized for being nothing more than a public relations gimmick – a disorganized, self-serving photo opportunity for the University.
Senior Rachel Krausman has been involved with the service day since it was put in place her freshman year and moved on to organize the event as an upperclassman for the past three years. And she has handed administrators a detailed proposal with worthwhile changes to make the event more productive, including extending the amount of time students spend volunteering.
It is encouraging that the University is taking student input into consideration and acknowledging the flaws of Freshman Day of Service.
But GW should not stop there. It should continue to look to other students for feedback as well.
Freshman Day of Service is relatively new. It began four years ago as a way to introduce new Colonials to community service in D.C. But the day shouldn’t focus only on freshmen.
If GW wants to become a school that is known for its commitment to service, it has to involve more upperclassmen. Instead of tailoring a day just to freshmen, the University would benefit from broadening the scope of Freshman Day of Service to attract and solicit ideas from upperclassmen.
One criticism of the day of service is that students spend too much time doing  work like picking weeds or painting fences, which lack substance and have little impact. Students would get far more out of community service if they worked directly with people – perhaps elementary school children, the elderly or the homeless.
Freshmen should also have the opportunity to choose the kind of service they do. If they ranked their service placement sites in order of preference, they would not only feel more invested in their work, but they would also be more likely to continue serving the community in the future. If the University can spark enthusiasm and passion within those participants from the start, students are more likely to continue to take part in service opportunities throughout college.
Krausman also suggested that Freshman Day of Service events should take place at venues closer to campus. From a financial standpoint, that would cut down on the cost of busing students to locations across the city.
But if having students volunteer closer to campus cuts costs, then that unused money can be repurposed and donated to a local charity or shelter. There are many organizations located mere blocks from campus that are earnestly seeking volunteers.
Restricting the day to service at sites closer to campus and encouraging upperclassmen to get involved are ways to maximize the impact Colonials have on the community.
