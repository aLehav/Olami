Different abroad programs will need to make “case-by-case” determinations in terms of which ones are able to proceed in the future, but there can be a “permanent role” for this remote learning, Osdras said.
A panel of people with backgrounds in study abroad programs discussed the challenges for international education in a post-pandemic world Tuesday.
The panel consisted of a study abroad program officer, a current graduate student and a GW alumnus who spoke about uncertainties in education relating to COVID-19, the rise of anti-Asian racism and what study abroad programs may look like in the future. Jisoo Kim, the co-director of East Asia National Research Center, and Laura Engel, a professor of international affairs and education, moderated the discussion, which the research center hosted.
Here are some highlights from the event:
Study abroad during the pandemic 
Scott Osdras, the program officer at the American Councils for International Education, said study abroad programs switched to an online format last spring immediately after the virus became a global threat.
“When it was decided that overseas programming wouldn’t be feasible, our next challenge was shifting gears and coordinating with our funders and our overseas partners to reimagine our programs in a very short amount of time to make them meaningful and substantive and to offer a similar experience,” he said.
The ACIE released virtual solutions to programs shifting abroad, like having a virtual movie night with a language partner and having local music artists perform through Zoom calls, Osdras said. But he added that the “Zoom fatigue” and lack of immersion and connection to peers in the program resulted in a lack of interest, leading to a “significant” decline in participant enrollment this year.
Different abroad programs will need to make “case-by-case” determinations in terms of which ones are able to proceed in the future, but there can be a “permanent role” for this remote learning, Osdras said.
“I think we can offer [remote learning] in the future for students who may not be able to go overseas,” Osdras said. “But you want access to intensive language study and especially in certain languages that they don’t have access to in their home universities.”
Alexis Snyder, a graduate student studying Asian studies and a peer mentor for the Elliott School of International Affairs’ First Year Experience course, said she has participated in past intensive language learning programs in South Korea. This year, she planned to pursue another program in the country, but her plans changed as a result of COVID-19.
“Among all of us, it seems kind of uncertain when and how I will be able to pursue that same sort of intensive study in Korea, if possible in the future, in a year, next year from now,” she said.
Snyder said when students go abroad, they want to find opportunities that they would not experience or learn about in their home country, but she said her Elliott School mentees were also experiencing “uncertainty” regarding what programs will look like.
International students’ challenges and the rise of anti-Asian racism
Luz Ding, a freelance journalist, GW alumnus and former Hatchet reporter, said  international students are increasingly facing challenges with the rise of anti-Asian racism in the United States.
“When the U.S. started to confirm cases and up until the nationwide shut down, there were not many people taking precautions, social distancing, not many wearing a mask,” she said. “At the same time, there was also very limited testing capabilities. A lot of international students decided to go back to their home country and take classes.”
Ding said the first challenge for international students traveling throughout the world is the health concern. She added their secondary concern is being able to continue their education and find “career development prospects.” 
“There has always been a certain degree of visa restrictions,” she said. “So this led to another wave from international students leaving right upon graduation because they feel like they can’t find a job.”
Ding said there has been a rise in cases of anti-Asian racism in the country. She added that numerous incidents racist incidents have happened to her friends and professors and gave the example of an assault against an Asian woman in Manhattan last March.
“I didn’t hear any of my close friends report racist incidents until this year,” she said. “And me personally, I wasn’t caught in a racial slur until this year.”

The funds raised through the program will be split evenly between The Store and an emergency student fund.
Students, staff and faculty can now transfer their GWorld funds to their peers, according to a press release Monday.
GW is teaming up with Swipe Out Hunger, a nonprofit that aims to address food insecurity on college campuses, to allow the University community to donate the remainder of their GWorld balances to other students. Interested students can transfer their funds through the GET app, and the money raised will be split evenly between The Store and the Abrahms’ Family Fund, which provides emergency Colonial Cash to students.
“Small donations by cardholders can mean so much to students who are relying on The Store as a resource during these unprecedented times,” Kathryn Howell, second-year graduate student in the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration and The Store’s president, said in the release. 
Swipe Out Hunger works with more than 120 colleges across the country to find solutions to campus hunger, according to its website. 
Food insecurity is not a new issue to GW. Students created a task force in 2018 to examine the food access on campus, and the group produced a report the following spring encouraging officials to create a dining hall on the Foggy Bottom Campus and offer more meal deals.
Emily Dieker, the director of the GWorld office, said COVID-19 has “exacerbated” the problem of food insecurity, and the initiative will make a “big” difference for the students in need. 
She added that launching the partnership during Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week, which began Monday and runs through Friday, addresses the “pressing” issue of food access.
“In a time when we’re all dealing with so much individually, it’s heartening to see how much members of the GW community support one another,” Dieker said in the release.

The ANC called on President-elect Joe Biden to take down fencing barricading the White House, saying it takes away a spot protesters frequent.
A local governing body is pressing the incoming presidential transition team to strip down protective fencing that surrounds the White House, saying it obstructs pedestrian access.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission passed a resolution Wednesday night requesting President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ transition team to plan on removing the fencing surrounding the White House, fortified as a safeguard against racial justice and election demonstrations this year. In the final ANC meeting of the calendar year and the existing term, commissioners also heard updates from recently reelected D.C. Council member Brooke Pinto and approved another after-hours permit for an ongoing construction project at 2100 Pennsylvania Ave.
Here are a few of the meeting’s highlights:
ANC calls to remove White House fencing 
Senior and ANC chair James Harnett said the fencing, which surrounds the White House, Lafayette Park, President’s Park and the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, has hindered access to public pedestrian space often used by protesters.
“It obstructed pedestrians’ access to Lafayette Park and to areas that are traditional protest bases for members of the community and the public that wish to have their voice heard to the occupant of the White House,” Harnett said.
The United Secret Service first blockaded pedestrian access in the area last September when the National Park Service helped fund a construction project on the fencing surrounding the White House, closing off the public from the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue. The Secret Service and the National Park Service Police extended protective fencing earlier this year in preparation for racial justice protests, blocking off Lafayette and President’s parks and creating a wider layer of security around the White House.
The resolution states that the Biden-Harris transition team should plan to remove the fencing following the inauguration since the construction project has concluded and security threats no longer remain.
Brooke Pinto updates the community
Pinto – the D.C. Council member who represents Ward 2, including Foggy Bottom – attended the meeting and updated the commissioners and public attendees on several city issues, including election protests and the COVID-19 pandemic. Pinto, who’s served on the Council since winning the Ward 2 special election in June, was reelected to the Council during the general election earlier this month.
Pinto said she was “very pleased” with the peaceful demonstrations in D.C. during the election, but she condemned the violent actions of far-right demonstrators and outside agitators who flocked to D.C. last weekend to protest the results of the election and rail against counter-protesters. Pinto identified the Proud Boys as one group which endangered the city in failing to take health precautions amid the pandemic and violently attacking local residents.
“The violence that we saw in the city and destruction over the past weekend was extremely troubling and unacceptable,” she said. “While the right to peacefully protest is protected by the First Amendment, hate and violence has no place in our community at any time.”
Pinto also criticized the Metropolitan Police Department for several videos that surfaced of officers helping President Donald Trump supporters tear down Black Lives Matter signs and “standing by as violence unfolded.” Commissioners expressed similar concerns earlier in the meeting, noting how MPD appeared to favor far-right groups over Black Lives Matter protesters, who police tear gassed and shot rubber bullets at during peaceful demonstrations this summer.
“I was out there at Black Lives Matter Plaza and saw a lot of that disparity, and I think that certainly as a community, we owe our neighbors accountability, and making sure that we’re treating everybody with the respect that they deserve and recognizing that White nationalists that come into this city to incite violence should have no home here,” Harnett said.
Pinto said the Council will hold an oversight meeting next week to discuss appropriate protocol for officials to follow when handling elections and draw a line between classifying a demonstration as either a protest or a riot.
Pinto also discussed the city’s “alarming” rise in COVID-19 infections and urged locals to stay home, wear a mask and stay distanced from others. She also informed commissioners that she and six of her other colleagues wrote a letter to D.C. Public Schools officials “demanding more transparency and answers” about the firing of School Without Walls High School Principal Richard Trogisch, who opposed D.C. reopening plans, but she said District officials have refused to offer insight into the decision.
Commissioners greenlight Boston Properties’ after-hours permit
The ANC also unanimously passed legislation approving a request from Boston Properties – the real estate company reconstructing the site at 2100 Penn – to extend its after-hours construction permit from next Monday through the end of February as part of its renovation project. The resolution supports the company’s construction running from 7 p.m. to midnight Monday through Saturday and from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sundays.
The resolution also allots the company after-hours construction without noisy work from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. during December and from 6 to 7 a.m. until the end of February.

From the creators of family separation and election interference, the Trump administration is coming to a university near you – unless GW turns away their job applications.
Since Joe Biden won the presidential election last week, officials who have worked under President Donald Trump have started their job hunt. But veteran lobbyists say White House staffers will not be welcome on K Street – the home of many lobbying companies and law firms – because Trump’s controversial presidency comes with public relations risks. Just look at Stephen Miller, a Trump adviser who marked his tenure by vehemently backing anti-immigration policies. I’m not sure any lobbying firm would want him in their office.  
That does not mean Trump officials will be ostracized everywhere. As the administration comes to end, Trump officials could land at top public policy, international affairs and political science schools around the country – including GW. But universities should not be in the business of hiring people who were complicit in atrocious policies and opposition to science and integrity. Officials should hold members of the Trump administration accountable and reject them from positions at the University. 
Trump officials should not be able to hide from their wrongdoing in our classrooms. Their failure to distance themselves from Trump’s divisiveness, racism and bigotry cannot be forgiven now that Trump has lost. But inevitably, Trump officials will try to distance themselves from his legacy. Already, Republican senators have started to distance themselves from Trump, while his support from Republican political leaders has waned. As Adolf Eichmann pled at Nuremberg that it was a “misfortune to become entangled in these atrocities,” Trump officials cannot be allowed to feign ignorance. Administrators should not take the bait. 
White House officials are responsible for the implementation of policies that threatened democracy, tore families apart and endangered millions. While GW purports to be a top university in political science, it cannot justify hiring officials who worked to dismantle and undermine our democratic system. If GW claims to stand against Trump’s immigration policies, it cannot hire the officials who pushed to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy and put children in cages. If GW hopes for its faculty to be taken seriously in the fight against COVID-19, administrators cannot hire the officials who stayed silent while Trump called it a hoax. The University cannot oppose Trump’s policies and rhetoric while simultaneously hiring his staffers.
While the University should be a place for academic freedom through debate, it should not be a safe haven for those who have initiated or remained silent in the face of hate speech. Hiring Trump officials would undermine the mission and integrity of the University. GW is an institution that promotes science, while Trump officials have been complicit in denying its very existence. Denying science is not only dangerous for the planet and public health, it also undermines the work faculty have done to combat misinformation and promote scientific research. 
Hiring Trump officials would allow them to escape from accountability. Administrators should not hire Trump staffers just because they have government work experience. They will then be able to use our lecture halls and classrooms to continue promoting a dangerous agenda – or rehabilitating their fractured images. The University should not help Trump’s staffers repair their reputations by letting them preach to college students. 
Administrators should also be wary of the potential fallout from hiring Trump administration officials. At the University of Virginia, two professors resigned over the hiring of Marc Short, who was Trump’s White House director of legislative affairs. At Harvard University, alumni and students were outraged by the hiring of former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Students, alumni and faculty at GW are also likely to push back against hiring Trump officials, like when they protested an event that featured Betsy DeVos at the School of Media and Public Affairs. Administrators should recognize the consequences of hiring Trump officials and not make the mistake of angering the University community.
Allowing Trump officials to work for GW gives them a higher education seal of approval and a platform that allows them to dodge accountability, while undermining GW’s mission and integrity. For the past four years, White House staffers have helped to spread racism, bigotry and xenophobia – they cannot be allowed to hide in academia and merely move on.

We see and walk by people experiencing homelessness every day. And during a pandemic, it’s more important than ever that we help them, not ignore them.
COVID-19 is hitting everyone hard – students are struggling with online school, businesses are limiting their reopening, thousands of Americans are unemployed and more than 200,000 Americans have died. Amid reopening businesses in the District, reimposed restrictions and political unrest, D.C.’s homeless population has been overlooked and cast aside. So much so that the District is continuing to clear away homeless encampments, leaving the most vulnerable among us to increase their risk of getting sick.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised cities at the start of the pandemic that they should not execute encampment cleanups because it could increase the spread of the virus. It makes sense – those without a roof over their head look to a place like an encampment for shelter and community. But the District is continuing this practice and ignoring CDC guidance. Clearing away the place they call home and sending people to homeless shelters instead ignores the realities of the pandemic – that people need to stick in small circles and minimize travel. But the D.C. government is prioritizing the way the city looks over the quality of human lives.
The D.C. area reported a record number of COVID-19 cases this past week. This surge of cases follows a national trend that has resulted in an 80 percent increase of new cases, landing us at 11 million cases of COVID-19 in the United States. This pandemic does not discriminate who it infects and who it impacts, but what this pandemic does do is infect those who are at risk, do not engage in social distancing, do not self-isolate and do not have the ability to get regular tests. In this case, all eyes point to people experiencing homelessness.
D.C.’s homeless population deserve better than to be cleared from their homes in the middle of a pandemic and forced to relocate, exposing themselves to the virus in the process. The city needs to stop clearing encampments and follow the CDC’s guidelines – it will save lives.
The motive behind these cleanups is to keep the city’s streets and sidewalks clear. Residents complain about the encampments – that is no secret – but it’s alarming that the city government is giving in to these complaints during a major health crisis. There is no point in cleaning sidewalks and grassy areas if as a result, large amounts of the city are sick and dying of this highly infectious disease.
The city has taken some steps to help this vulnerable population during the pandemic. Officials installed precautionary items like hand washing stations and port-a-potties near encampments. They also provided several quarantine areas in contracted hotels around the city to protect those who are medically vulnerable. But officials cannot claim to be helping people experiencing homelessness if they continue to clean up a place they call home and find relative safety. Plus, some of the city’s programs have been criticized for a lack of organization and insensitivity toward people living there. For D.C., though, it’s all about optics.
Even when we’re not in a pandemic, these cleanups are damaging and dangerous for those experiencing homelessness. Residents are forced to gather all their belongings, leave the community in their encampment and face new challenges in an unfamiliar area. But the pandemic has turned these cleanups from damaging to outright deadly.
Treating those experiencing homelessness with compassion and care is not something new to major cities like D.C. Even Los Angeles, with an unsheltered homeless population of about 27,000, has halted encampment cleanups, changed their policies on when tents can be erected and have provided hand washing stations, portable toilets, dumpsters, vermin-proof trash cans and shower services. That’s humane – what D.C. is doing is not.
If you do not have a home to quarantine in, you cannot isolate yourself, you cannot engage in proper social distancing and your chances of contracting COVID-19 are ridiculously high. Encampments are people’s only space to stay within a “hub” – or a community of people where the threat of contracting the virus is relatively low. The D.C. government must protect that and ensure its homeless population has the resources they need to withstand the pandemic.

Woodley Cafe's bourbon pecan pie balances sweet with smoky in a dish sure to please the taste buds.
Whether you’re on the hunt for casual American food or diner-style desserts, Woodley Cafe has you covered. 
Located at 2619 Connecticut Ave. NW, the establishment is right across the street from Metro’s Woodley Park station on the Red Line and is just a few blocks away from some of D.C.’s most popular date spots, like the National Zoo and Adams Morgan’s lively 18th Street corridor. If you prefer to eat at home, you can also order from the cafe via DoorDash. 
Just like the other popular restaurants on Connecticut Avenue, Woodley Cafe features outdoor seating lined with a blue canopy to shield customers from the colder weather. String lights hang around the canopy at night, and space heaters are scattered around the tables for chilly days.
The narrow inside of the restaurant is reminiscent of a saloon: a wooden bar on the left side stretches across the length of the restaurant. The right side is lined with one continuous booth and small tables that seat parties of two. Per COVID-19 regulations, inside seating is limited to half capacity, so every other seat has been removed in order to practice social distancing. 
Woodley Cafe serves homestyle American grub, so make sure to prepare yourself for hearty, buttery dishes that warm you up during the colder months. More importantly, the cafe offers an all-day, anytime menu, so feel free to enjoy the Cajun shrimp penne ($18.95) for dinner or a ham, cheese and tomato omelette ($10.75) for breakfast. 
If you’re more traditional about your weekend brunch options, Woodley Cafe offers some classic choices, including eggs Benedict ($11.95). Those with a sweeter tooth can indulge the restaurant’s grilled French toast ($9.50) or the buttermilk pancakes ($9.25). 
To suite your caffeine addictions, Woodley Cafe offers fresh ground Colombian coffee ($2.50), but you can also have it customized to your liking, whether that be a cappuccino or an iced latte (both $3.95).
I’m all for eating breakfast for dinner, but I was craving something more savory for my meal. I spotted my favorite sandwich, a reuben ($12.25), which I decided to order it along with a side of sweet potato fries (add $4.75). 
But in line with the holiday season, my main goal was to find a dessert that embodies Thanksgiving fall flavors. I looked past the timeless New York-style cheesecake ($6.99) and “Chocolate Confusion” mass of brownie, cookie and cake ($6.99) and opted for the bourbon pecan pie ($6.99).
The pie’s gooey, oozy filling was not overly sweet, thanks to the notes of Kentucky bourbon and vanilla that added just the perfect hint of smokiness. The crust was the perfect balance between flaky and chewy, crumbling apart with every bite but not turning into a disappointing sand-like texture. The candied pecans on top held the pie together and added a delicious crunch with every bite. 
For classic American breakfast, lunch or dinner at any time of any day, check out Woodley Cafe.

Harald Griesshammer, a faculty senator, said online voting should be permitted since the meeting was conducted entirely virtual.
The Faculty Assembly overwhelmingly voted Wednesday to launch a faculty-wide survey about University President Thomas LeBlanc’s leadership and communication abilities, which could lead to an indication of no confidence.
The assembly, which is open to all faculty members with full-time faculty as voting members, directed the Faculty Senate to launch the survey and subsequently report its results to the assembly in a 152-25 vote. Arthur Wilson, the chair of the senate executive committee, had signaled support for conducting the survey at the last senate meeting, and the move came following a tense standoff over the assembly’s ability to conduct online voting.
Guillermo Orti, a faculty senator who presented the petition calling for the survey, said the survey will allow faculty to express their “sentiments” about GW’s leadership.
“The senate has already started preparing an instrument for getting this information,” he said. “I believe it will be a most welcome perspective to get this by the faculty for the faculty.”
Hundreds of faculty, staff and students have called on LeBlanc to resign in recent months, citing officials’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other controversial decisions.
The survey could lead to an indication of no confidence, censure, approval, praise or trust in LeBlanc and the administration, the approved petition states.
Charles Garris, a faculty senator and former senate executive committee chair, said the survey would be “inappropriate” because it would only create a “complete spectacle.”
“You can see from the language of the petition that the faculty have some objective in mind,” Garris said. “This is not a well-meaning survey. This is a malevolent action taken by a group of faculty. This is not something we should entertain.”
Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights said trustees will conduct a performance review of LeBlanc beginning early next year.
“This process is driven by the Board of Trustees – it is one of our most important responsibilities,” she said at the meeting. “Given this time table, we will not consider other feedback for the president’s evaluation until the process begins in early spring.”
LeBlanc did not immediately return a request for comment through a spokesperson.
The petition’s passing followed a lengthy debate over faculty’s ability to vote online during the assembly.
Just after LeBlanc began the meeting, Harald Griesshammer – a faculty senator and associate professor of physics – called for online votes to be permitted. But LeBlanc accepted Parliamentarian Steve Charnovitz’s assessment that the Faculty Organization Plan required faculty to be “present” to vote, which he said does not extend to virtual meeting platforms.
“We’ve always interpreted that for as long as I’ve been parliamentarian to mean physically present in the room,” Charnovitz said. “We’ve had requests for many years for faculty to be able to vote from their office or call in their vote. We’ve always maintained that remote voting is not permitted, so it’s still not permitted today.”
Griesshammer said online voting should be permitted since the meeting was conducted entirely virtual.
“The fact that the president just gaveled the meeting actually establishes that we can vote,” he said. “It specifies as a meeting place the WebEx Events 3000 platform. They cannot be disenfranchised.”
Griesshammer later asked for unanimous consent that the rules be suspended, which would permit online voting, but his motion received “quite a few” objections, officials said. The objections were submitted through a private chat and were not made public.
Jamie Cohen-Cole, a faculty senator and associate professor of American studies, motioned to appeal LeBlanc’s ruling, adding that the meeting had been postponed by more than a month to ensure votes would be “fair, complete and transparent.”
Charnovitz said the motion was “unprecedented” and has not been offered in the 60-year history of shared governance at GW and asked LeBlanc to declare the motion “frivolous.” He added that faculty could not vote to appeal the ruling because online votes were unauthorized.
“Holding such a vote is impractical because, as the chair has ruled, online voting is not allowed,” he said. “For obvious reasons, online voting cannot be applied to overrule the chair’s holding that online votes are not allowed. I see no benefit to engage in a repetitive cycle of appeals and points of order.”
The independent Faculty Association called on its members to leave the meeting in protest over the ruling.
“GWUFA recommends that all participants walk out of the Faculty Assembly now,” the group said in an email to members during the meeting. “If you choose, please use the chat to state your reasons why.”
Later in the meeting, the assembly unanimously consented to a narrower motion allowing for faculty to vote online solely on the petition.
The petition states the survey shall be launched by Dec. 15. The survey’s complete results along with recommendations and comments by the senate shall be reported to the assembly by Jan. 31, according to the petition.

Ward 1 Council member Brianne Nadeau said in a tweet earlier this month that MPD’s overspending was “reckless,” and the department shouldn’t receive funds previously intended for health and human services programs.
Updated: Nov. 23, 2020 at 3:01 p.m.
After District police spent millions of dollars in excess overtime spending this summer, the D.C. Council unanimously voted Tuesday to require the Metropolitan Police Department to report overtime costs more frequently in the future.
The Council’s emergency legislation, which takes effect for 90 days barring a mayoral veto, stipulates that MPD must disclose its spending on police overtime shifts to broaden oversight of local law enforcement finances after every two pay periods, according to The Washington Post. The newly passed bill follows a summer with tense confrontations between protesters and police during several racial justice demonstrations that caused MPD to spend more than $40 million in overtime payments, the Post reported.
Mayor Muriel Bowser requested to reallocate $43 million of unspent city funds to finance the overtime spending fees that MPD logged over the summer – a move Council members have criticized for draining funding from social services. Even though lawmakers voted to reallocate funds from MPD to bolster social services in July, Bowser requested to pull funding from the Workforce Investment Fund, the Department of Health Care Finance and the city’s interest repayment fund for short-term borrowing, according to DCist.
Ward 1 Council member Brianne Nadeau said in a tweet earlier this month that MPD’s overspending was “reckless,” and the department shouldn’t receive funds previously intended for health and human services programs.
“This reprogramming is adding insult to injury, and it’s outrageous,” Nadeau said in the tweet thread. “While we cannot reverse the existing MPD expenditures, we can strengthen the Council’s checks and balances to ensure the mayor does not write another blank check to MPD in the future.”

Buckley, a first-year law student, said she was raised in Hong Kong before coming to D.C. and while working in a U.S. State Department program, met an Uyghur who was sentenced to hard labor in 2016 when he went back to China.

The Student Bar Association Senate held its last senate meeting of the semester Tuesday, approving a new student organization to advocate for Uyghur ethnic minorities in China.
SBA Sen. Pavan Patamalla, the sponsor of the bill, presented two leaders of the organization to speak on behalf of the new organization, the Uyghur Human Rights Initiative. Joel Taubman, a co-founder of the organization and a first-year law student, said he came to GW Law to fight anti-Semitism and discrimination, which drove his interest in forming the group with his co-founder Kelly Buckley.
Chinese officials have been conducting a strategy of detaining ethnic minorities before any crime is committed and placing them in mass detention camps for forced ideological training, the Associated Press has reported.
“We are here as law students, with access to faculty, with access to the legal world in many ways, and our goal with this organization is to use that edge to advance the wider legal knowledge and understanding of this issue and how it impacts legal fields,” Taubman said.
He said the organization had a “successful” event last week moderated by Donald Clark, a research professor of law and the club’s faculty sponsor. Taubman added the organization also had a body meeting during which they created a preliminary board of four members, plus two additional appointed members.
Buckley, a second-year law student, said she was raised in Hong Kong before coming to D.C., and while working in a U.S. State Department program, she met an Uyghur who was sentenced to hard labor in 2016 when he went back to China.
“The People’s Republic of China has been rounding up millions of ethnic minorities including the Uygurs, innocent people to spend years in prison and internment camps, and the torturing includes waterboarding, sexual abuse and psychological abuse,” she said.
