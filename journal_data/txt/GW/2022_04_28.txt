D.C. Attorney General candidates convened at the School of Media and Public Affairs to discuss their platforms and campaigns Tuesday.
The candidates each spoke about how their leadership would have an impact on important D.C. policies, including gun violence and the District’s unhoused population. The forum was hosted by GW in partnership with the League of Women Voters D.C. and GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew moderated the forum.
Brian Schwalb, a partner of the D.C. branch of the Venable law firm, spoke about the diverse experience needed for the position and how he thinks he is distinguishably prepared for it. He said his experiences like being a former member of the Department of Justice’s Tax Division prepares him for the diverse array of topics he may face as attorney general.
“I alone in this race bring that experience,” Schwalb said. “And what happens when you’ve represented a lot of different types of clients across a lot of different issues is you learn how to exercise judgment.”
He said while D.C. is a “magnet” for talented people who want to live and work in the city, the talent in the city is not distributed equitably across wards, but that he wants to promote lower income and education gaps across the District as attorney general.
“We don’t share the equity, the income and the opportunity that is abundant in our city fairly across all wards and all neighborhoods,” Schwalb said. “And that is the biggest challenge we have, collectively, all of us who love Washington need to use the law to make sure that those gaps in equity and income are narrow.”
Schwalb said officials need to treat unhoused people living in encampments as humans before evicting them from the encampments, referring to a controversial District policy that led to the closure of major encampments last fall. He said domestic violence issues, poor living conditions and a lack of access to mental health services are some of the key causes of homelessness, and officials must address those to help people.
“So the way we address homelessness as a city has to look again at what the root causes are,” Schwalb said. “To answer the question, given that I don’t favor using bulldozers to move people out of there, we have to deal with that as human beings.”
Ryan Jones, a GW Law alumnus and founder of his own law firm, said he wants to use the attorney general position to improve equity in the law and in society. He said he is running not for himself, but to “give back” to his hometown by using the legal skills he developed over the course of his career to ensure equality for all D.C. residents.
“I want to create equal access to justice,” Jones said. “I know that the courtrooms play an important role in creating equality in our laws and how we guide our lives for a functional society.”
Bruce Spiva, a managing partner at the D.C. branch of the Perkins Coie law firm, spoke about his passion for justice, saying his 30 years of law experience has prepared him to be attorney general.
He said he was inspired by his parents, who grew up in the South under Jim Crow laws, and their belief in “the power of the law” to create change for the better, as in the case of Brown v. Board of Education, a Supreme Court decision in 1954 which desegregated public schools nationwide.
“I’ve been the David against the Goliath,” Spiva said. “And I’m prepared to do it and win.”
Spiva said he believes in the need to address the root causes of gun violence by focusing on greater investment in violence prevention programs, particularly among younger populations, in addition to ensuring fair consequences for people who commit acts of gun violence. Spiva also talked about his support for the Cure the Streets program, a public safety program that seeks to reduce gun violence.
“My preferred solution would be to allow there to be private suits and public suits against gun manufacturers,” Spiva said. “And I would certainly seek to do that if I could, but I recognize that there are some limitations born of the fact that the NRA, unfortunately, has too many congresspeople in their pocket.”

Clyburn, D-S.C., said he is working with other legislators to eliminate some student loan debt.
Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., spoke about his career and the philosophy of his work at the Elliott School of International Affairs Wednesday.
Clyburn, the House majority whip and South Carolina’s 6th District representative, talked about his recent endeavors in politics, like his endorsement of now-President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and his efforts to help alleviate the student debt crisis. GW College Democrats hosted the event and GWCD President PJ Johnson moderated the talk.
Clyburn said pieces of legislation like the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will serve as accomplishments for voters questioning the Democratic Party’s effectiveness heading into the midterms.
“To me, when people examine these programs, they find plenty to vote for,” he said.
Clyburn said he is working with Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to pass student loan forgiveness legislation. In 2019, they introduced a bill advocating for debt elimination of up to $50,000.
“I think the student loan debt is a big suppression on livelihoods,” he said. “If you’re coming out of college with $100,000 student loan debt – and I’ve had some employees come out with $130,000 of student loan debt – how can you start a family, purchase a home, with that kind of debt hanging over you from student loans?”
He said he first faced the quandary of who to support in the 2020 Democratic primaries at his Fish Fry, an annual event he hosts with food and dancing festivities, which often draws powerful politicians from around his home state and the country. He said 7,000 people attended the 2019 event, including 20 Democratic presidential candidates.
He said he later asked his wife, who died in Sept. 2019, for counsel on who to endorse, who told him he should endorse Biden to improve the odds of a Democrat winning the election.
“She said ‘I don’t care how many people are running for president,’” Clyburn said. “‘I don’t care how many are good friends of ours. If we want to win this race, we better nominate Joe Biden.’”
Before publicly endorsing Biden, Clyburn said he met with him to outline a few requests, like the appointment of a Black woman to the Supreme Court. Biden nominated Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson earlier this year, and the Senate confirmed her nomination to the bench earlier this month.
Clyburn said if someone wants to go into public service, he recommends they get to know and try to understand the people they are going to serve.
“You get to know what their dreams and aspirations are,” he said. “And then you figure out how you can develop an approach, a proposal, some policy that will help them fulfill their dreams and aspirations. If you can do that, they will reward you handsomely.”

The report states that the Medical Faculty Associates contributed $299.9 million of income to the District.
The University contributed $1.6 billion of income to the District’s economy in the 2020 fiscal year, according to a report released in February.
The report states expenses from research, students, construction and alumni generated 1.2 percent of the District’s total gross regional product. The University increased the economic value of the District with 12,694 supported jobs and investments in local goods and services, according to the report.
The University contributed $872.9 million in income to the District from employee payroll and payments for operations like facilities and professional services, according to the report. In FY 2020, GW employed 5,379 faculty and staff whose combined payroll totaled $901.9 million, adjusted down for payroll funding the University received from “district sources,” the report states.
The Medical Faculty Associates, a nonprofit medical practice organization that is separate but dependent on the University, contributed $299.9 million of income to the District, according to the report.
“GW benefits society as a whole in Washington, D.C. by creating a more prosperous economy and generating a variety of savings through the improved lifestyles of GW D.C.-based alumni,” the study states.
Student expenses like food and transportation contributed $73.5 million of income to the District’s economy, according to the study. Attendee expenses from Commencement and athletic events, like food and lodging, contributed an estimated additional $3.2 million of income to the city.
“The University’s reputation and activities attract visitors and students from outside Washington, D.C., whose expenditures benefit the District’s vendors,” the study states.
The report also says GW graduates receive an 11.4 percent average annual return on their investment into a GW education.
“Over a working lifetime, the benefits of the bachelor’s degree over a high school diploma will amount to an undiscounted value of $2.7 million in higher earnings per GW graduate who remains in the District,” the report states. “The present value of the cumulative higher future earnings that GW’s FY 2020 students will receive over their working careers is $3.0 billion.”
The report also states the District will receive about $114.3 million in value based on alumni who pay taxes and save their money in D.C. after leaving GW, while also providing other services to the community like public mental health treatment and job training.
“The results of this study demonstrate that GW creates value from multiple perspectives,” the report states. “The University benefits the District’s businesses by increasing consumer spending in the District and supplying a steady flow of qualified, trained workers to the workforce.”

The gift will fund an endowment for the display and upkeep of the equestrian textiles and a series of internship, fellowship and scholarship opportunities.
The Textile Museum received a series of three new gifts, including a combination of nearly $5 million worth of historical artifacts and endowment support, officials said in a release Sunday.
Two donors – former museum Board of Trustees member Judy Brick Freedman and her husband Allen R. Freedman – gave the museum 100 equestrian textiles, like horse back riding items like saddle blankets and other trappings, along with a new endowment. The estate of former trustee Joseph Fell also donated about a $5 million gift to the Textile Museum’s endowment.
“The Freedman and Fell families’ philanthropy has bolstered The George Washington University Museum and The Textile Museum’s global profile and secured its future as a destination for experiencing art and textiles from around the world,” interim University President Mark Wrighton said in the release. “We extend our gratitude for their support and commitment to the museum.”
The gift from the Freedman’s will fund an endowment for the display and upkeep of the equestrian textiles and series of internships, fellowships, student scholarships and guest lectures.
Officials said they plan to launch a “major exhibition” to showcase the new equestrian textiles in 2026 – the Year of the Horse in the traditional Chinese lunar calendar.
“The endowment that Judy and Allen Freedman have established, together with their funding for the 2026 exhibition and publication, will ensure that these magnificent works will be studied and displayed for generations to come,” Textile Museum Director John Wetenhall said in the release.

Head Coach Chris Caputo named his third addition to the men’s basketball staff Thursday, selecting the team’s director of operations.
Cooper Handelsman will join the Colonials after serving as an assistant coach at Brown during the last three years, guiding star players like Jaylan Gainey, a two-time Ivy League defensive player of the year, and Kino Lilly Jr., the Ivy League’s rookie of the year this past season. The hiring marks Caputo’s third in a week following assistant coach Brenden Straughn and director of recruiting Eric Rubenstein – part of the process to rebuild the team’s depleted coaching staff.
Men’s basketball fired former Head Coach Jamion Christian and the entire coaching staff after the team was eliminated from the Atlantic 10 Championship, which gave way to the transfers of leading scorers, sophomore guard Joe Bamisile and freshman guard Brayon Freeman.
“Cooper has the diversity of experience we were looking for in the role of director of basketball operations,” Caputo said in the press release. “He was not only an outstanding player at Kenyon College, but his organizational skills developed at the Hoop Group and his work at two highly competitive academic institutions like Lehigh and Brown make him the perfect fit to run our daily operations for GW.”
Before Brown, Handelsman was the director of Hoop Group, a grassroots youth basketball organization based in New Jersey, where he recruited more than 3,000 student-athletes to their summer camps. He established Chicago-based camps and tournaments to promote the organization’s platform and showcase student-athletes during recruitment periods.
Handelsman started his career as a video coordinator at Lehigh in 2015, where he managed video-related operations, including films for games, scouting, practice and recruiting for a season. He graduated in 2015 from Kenyon College, where he was named team captain during his senior year and set the program’s single-game assist record.
“I’m grateful to join the George Washington community and work with Coach Caputo,” Handelsman said. “The combination of Washington D.C., and high-level academics will allow us to attract some of the best student-athletes to the university. Coach has a vision of how to build a successful program, and I’m excited to be a part of it.”

After the next academic year, Whole Foods on I Street will no longer sell groceries on GWorld. In their announcement of the grocery chain’s departure from the GWorld card program, officials called the grocery store chain an “integral” part of students’ meal planning, and rightfully so. Its loss is a major setback in GW’s long-term attempts to tackle on-campus food insecurity. Rather than wait for Whole Foods’ planned exit from the GWorld card program, the University and its community can prepare to address on-campus food insecurity now. With the cost of food preventing students from eating, GW should invest more funds in and expand the reach of The Store, its take-what-you-need on-campus food pantry. 
Foggy Bottom may appear to have an extensive dining scene, but convenience doesn’t equal accessibility and affordability – Whole Foods is practically students’ only option for a grocery store. The 25th Street Trader Joe’s doesn’t take GWorld, and The Georgetown Safeway – which does accept dining dollars – requires an hour-long round trip on a city bus or shuttle to the Mount Vernon Campus.
Food insecurity is an economic issue as much as it is a logistical one, and the University’s dining plans have failed to address it. When GW transitioned to an open meal plan in 2016, students said they still frequently ran out of funds and food before the end of the semester. A 2019 report from the Wisconsin HOPE Lab found that 39 percent of students said they faced low or very low levels of food security, worrying about food and skipping meals.
With Whole Foods no longer accepting GWorld, students’ food insecurity will likely worsen. Preparing food at home with items from Whole Foods and other grocery stores can be more cost-effective than traditional and counter service restaurants – a single salad at Sweetgreen costs between $10 and $12, not including sides and a beverage. A week’s worth of the same salad would cost less than $30 at Whole Foods, more than halving the average cost of the daily meal. The USDA estimates a nutritious, practical, cost-effective diet for a one-person household costs between about $60 and $80 a week – a price that’s far more effective to spend on a week’s worth of groceries than a single meal. But students’ ability to stretch their budget decreases when vendors, especially grocery stores like Whole Foods, withdraw from the GWorld system.
GW accounts for that cost-effectiveness in its dining plans, where students with kitchens received fewer dining dollars than their kitchen-less peers under its legacy plan. But this arrangement fails to address the impending reality that students with a kitchen soon won’t be able to spend their dining dollars as effectively when Whole Foods stops taking GWorld. The cost of purchasing groceries out-of-pocket on top of subscribing to one of the University’s new meal plans under its all-you-care-to-eat dining hall system adds up. I’ve already experienced this – I spend about $200 dollars a month shopping for groceries at a non-GWorld vendor and have a remaining dining cash balance of over $3,000. Dining cash is non-refundable and non-transferable unless students withdraw from their housing agreements at the start of the semester. And while remaining balances roll over into the next semester, that isn’t helpful if students don’t use dining dollars.
Without Whole Foods as part of the GWorld system, the University won’t be able to meet all of students’ nutritional needs. Students can’t subsist on chicken sandwiches and pizza alone, but paying extra for fresh produce and other ingredients starts to become a financial burden.
The Store, which offers a take-what-you-need supply of grocery items and other household goods at two locations in District House and West Hall, is a more concrete solution to food insecurity. The Store circumvents the stigma around food insecurity and food aid with its emphasis on privacy and discretion – it doesn’t require background checks on students’ financial or conduct history, and shoppers remain anonymous. To that end, the University has partnered with the national nonprofit Swipe Out Hunger to encourage students to donate their excess GWorld balances to The Store since 2020.
Philanthropic donations from students, faculty, alumni and other donors can’t support The Store alone. Additional funding from the Student Association and Division of Student Affairs can help The Store meet students’ food needs. And the University ought to set aside more funding and more space for an expanded food pantry when it renovates District House later this year. While The Store must remain free to use for those in dire need, expanding it for students who are only occasionally or rarely food insecure would be one way to offer more flexibility to students struggling to afford groceries.
Officials should also encourage students to devote their spare time and money to The Store beyond just pushing them to use its resources. Adopting a pay-what-you-can model for year-round donations in addition to the Swipe Out Hunger campaign would allow students with excess dining dollars to swap that financial burden for a boon – fresh, affordable groceries. Instead of waiting for a sudden rush of donations at the end of the year, consistent small-dollar donations could give The Store some flexibility of its own while ensuring students’ access to food. Whether because of logistics or the expense involved, only The Store’s Foggy Bottom Campus location stocks perishable items. But greater demand for food and greater support for the food pantry’s vital work could expand its reach, especially to students already isolated on the Mount Vernon Campus.
Whole Foods’ withdrawal from the GWorld system threatens students’ access to relatively affordable and accessible food. With new living arrangements, work opportunities and the everyday pressures of college life, the last thing students should worry about is where their next meal will come from. If both the University and students are willing to support The Store with their time and money, they can worry just a little less.

As final exams arrive, many students will be required to go to a classroom and test in person alongside fellow students. Even though testing has evolved rapidly in recent years to allow for innovative virtual options, some professors still insist on conducting exams the old-fashioned way – in person and on paper. Instead of utilizing technology and virtual innovation, this outdated practice is inconvenient for students and unnecessary in today’s world. GW should conduct all final exams online so students no longer have to work around needlessly stressful in-person paper tests and can instead take advantage of simpler, more efficient virtual options.
During remote learning last school year, professors tested their students virtually with options like take-home assessments and virtual exams conducted via Blackboard. The alternatives allowed students to choose which testing environment worked best for them, proving that exams were much more convenient online than in person. Since the return to in-person classes last fall, professors wisely retained some online testing elements that served to be just as effective at testing students’ learning and kept students and faculty from walking all the way to class. But some professors still insist on administering in-person paper exams even though they’re more difficult to attend, complete and grade. A student taking an exam on paper has to worry about handwriting, spelling mistakes, and estimating word count. Online tools can eliminate the hassle of worrying about these and other surface-level concerns so students can focus on demonstrating their knowledge of course material.
The pressure of time that in-person assessments induce creates a stressful environment, keeping students from demonstrating their knowledge to the best of their ability. Professors use paper materials like Scantrons for multiple-choice or bluebooks, small paper booklets with ruled pages, for short responses even though students have computers to work more quickly and efficiently. Paper exams require students to sit at a small desk, grab a pen and scribble down answers, facts, details and analyses onto a tiny sheet of paper as fast as they can. It is necessary to give tests time limits, but handwriting responses takes longer than typing, which creates undue stress. Typing up responses instead of writing them out can buy students some more time to come up with quality answers for essays and short answer questions.
Holding all exams on computers would also make grading easier once hard-to-read handwriting is no longer a concern. A professor once told me that if a written answer is illegible, they often grade it based on the students’ performance on the rest of the test. It isn’t fair for students to be punished with a bad grade for poor penmanship, especially when time-limited exams require you to write quickly. There is no excuse for inefficiencies like this when students and professors have the technological resources available to do better.
Cheating is arguably the top concern among faculty considering online exams. They worry that if students are left unsupervised, they will use outside resources like their notes or the internet for closed-book exams. While these concerns are valid, faculty can mitigate cheating in an online format. Time limits push students to rely only on their own knowledge without the same amount of time to consult unapproved materials, especially during tests where they must think critically about their answers instead of simply recalling facts from memory. To avoid cheating, professors should use the Lockdown browser, a software where they can conduct exams virtually while blocking access to other sites and applications during a test. These browsers are an easy-to-use way to stop students from using their computers to cheat during a test, and professors who are especially worried about cheating can proctor their exams using students’ webcams.
Amid the late April spike in COVID-19 cases, it is likely that several students will miss one or more final exams this semester due to the need to isolate, forcing them to take a course as an incomplete on the semester while they wait until the fall to make up for missed work. Starting a new semester is difficult enough without having to worry about last year’s courses, and unfortunately students in this predicament risk forgetting material that is vital to perform well on a delayed in-person exam.
Even if the pandemic subsides, students in special circumstances will still need to miss tests due to illness, injury and other personal issues. Allowing students to take their tests from home will eliminate most of these obstacles out of their control while making testing a less stressful ordeal for everyone else. Students infected with an illness can take virtual exams online without putting their classmates at risk, while those without severe symptoms can still have the option to do the same out of precaution, an option not currently available. Students should not need to miss their exams if they are called home during exam week for a personal event like a funeral.
As more technological innovations become available, there are fewer reasons for professors to require students to take tests that are held in person and conducted with outdated paper materials. With more efficient options on the table, professors should hold final exams virtually to eliminate antiquated testing methods and make everyone’s exam week a little easier while they’re at it.

For my entree, I ordered the Gumbo Z’Herbes because of my love for the dish that I ate growing up in the south and have tried multiple times in New Orleans. 
Nothing compares to the Creole and Cajun food of the south, but Dauphine’s is serving upscale takes on classic New Orleans dishes that will transport your taste buds to the French Quarter.
The sleek New Orleans-inspired restaurant is conveniently located just a few blocks from the Farragut North and McPherson Square Metro stations at 1100 15th St. NW, but it’s only open for dinner service starting at 5 p.m. daily and Sunday brunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. From the raw oyster bar selection and fresh seafood to the gourmet Creole entree selections and New Orlean’s staple dessert beignets, Dauphine’s curates an impressive southern dining experience.
As soon as you step inside Dauphine’s, your eye will catch small yet charming decor details, like the restaurant’s name intricately embedded into the tiled floor in front of the host stand and a cow-hoof-shaped bell on the host stand to call for service if needed. If you’ve ever been to New Orleans, you’ll also recognize the elaborate metal canopy framing adorned with hanging fern plants that surrounds the bar area, an architecture style familiar to the balconies of Bourbon Street.
The restaurant has multiple dining areas, all visible from the entrance because of the open layout and indoor balcony-style upper level. The raw bar and main dining area are to your left, and the main bar with high-top seating is to the right, with the upper dining room up a staircase in the back of the room. With the warmer weather, you can also take advantage of the two outdoor seating areas on either side of the restaurant’s ground level.
To start, I sampled some of the Orchard Point oysters ($3 each), sourced from Maryland, served on a bed of ice pebbles with cocktail sauce, vinegar, seasoned Saltine crackers and grated horseradish in an empty clam shell. They were ice cold and mouth-wateringly salty, and the accompaniments made each one go down smoothly. If you’re not a seafood lover, you can’t go wrong with the bread service ($10) which consists of freshly baked biscuits, sweet potato brioche and french baguette served with an addicting salted cane sugar butter.
Depending on your hunger level and budget, Dauphine’s menu features small plates and large plates on its dinner menu. In the future, I want to try the mirliton and pig ear salad ($13) with arugula, walnuts, Asian pear and aged gouda from the small plates or the dirty rice and duck stuffed quail ($33) with sweet potato, charred radicchio and pepper jelly jus from the large plates.
But for my entree, I ordered the Gumbo Z’Herbes ($14) because of my love for the dish that I ate growing up in the south and have tried multiple times in New Orleans. The waiter brought out a wide, shallow bowl and drizzled the potato salad lying in the middle with gumbo that he poured from a saucer. Eating potato salad in gumbo is a traditional practice in Louisiana. And like at Dauphine’s, it often takes the place of rice.
Dauphines’ gumbo has a dark roux base, a mixture of fat and flour that reaches a deep copper color when cooked together, and it’s filled with sauteed vegetables, collard greens and roasted pork bits. This departs slightly from gumbo’s usual preparation with smoked sausage and seafood but was equally enjoyable. The flavor of the stew was deeply savory without being overly salty, and the collards gave the stew a more vegetal flavor and complimented the smoky flavor of the pork.
When I took a bite of the potato salad with the stew, it was a cool, fresh contrast to the warm richness of the gumbo. And the green onions that topped the traditional mayo-based potato salad packed a punch of brightness and acidity. Of course, I asked for some Tabasco hot sauce – I like my gumbo extra spicy. Aside from the heat it brought, the acidity of the vinegar-based hot sauce added another dimension of flavor to the dish.
For dessert, I enjoyed the beignets ($9) which came with a shaker of powdered sugar. They were about three bites each with a crispy golden exterior and piping hot and doughy interior, making for a sweet ending to the meal.
If you’re looking to try a cocktail, Dauphine’s has plenty. If I were ordering, I’d want a sip of the hurricane, a take on a popular drink in New Orleans ($15) with tropical fruit sour, or the Dauphine’s martini ($16), scented with a warm spice called anise.
If you’re a southerner like me searching for some Creole and Cajun cooking, or if you’re just looking for a new gourmet dining experience, check out Dauphine’s.

The $12,000 will provide financial assistance to students especially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, covering emergency medical bills, temporary housing and academic expenses.
The Student Association Senate unanimously passed a bill moving $12,000 to an emergency student assistance fund and approved funding for student organizations for fiscal year 2023 during a meeting Monday.
The SA CARES Act transfers $12,000 – roughly $11,600 of which was reserved in the SA’s General Fund for a program that “directly helps students” – to the CARES Fund, which provides financial assistance to students affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and costs like medical bills, temporary housing and academic expenses. Senators also unanimously passed the FY23 General Allocation Part I Act and the Invest in the Future Act, which approved the finance committee’s general student request allocations for the fall semester and cleared more than $100,000 for student organizations to use on “capital assets,” respectively.
SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U, who sponsored all three bills, said the funds for the CARES Act were “set aside” at the beginning of the fiscal year with the plan to allocate donations at the end of the year.
“This is a fund we set aside at the beginning of this fiscal year,” Xu said at the meeting. “We are required to designate and appropriate this fund to fund a program or initiative as directly help students.”
The SA finance committee allocated roughly $1 million in response to requests that totaled about $5 million from nearly 269 student organizations, who on average received about 30 percent of their requested funding.
Xu said the Invest in the Future Act was a “continuation” of the Year-End Capital Investment Act, which reallocates leftover SA funds to student organizations for “durable goods” like sports equipment that will last a year or more. The Invest in the Future Act disburses more than $108,000 to student organizations as outlined in the Year-End Capital Investment Act.
Senators also unanimously passed the Student Association Finance Act, which amends the SA bylaws to include the SA Fee rate, establishes the University-Wide Program Fund, which funds large-scale events, and establishes a Legislative Budget Office. Xu, who sponsored the bill, said the new Legislative Budget Office will put together reports and conduct research to “assist” the finance committee and the legislative branch so legislators “can focus on their policy.”
“This will formalize and codify the internal finances for this year’s association to promote accountability and transparency,” he said.
Senators failed to pass the Development and Alumni Relations Amendment Act by a vote of 25-3-3, which would have created an executive secretary of development and alumni relations. SA Sen. Derek Lo, CCAS-U, who voted against the bill, said the legislation should be saved for next year’s senate so this year’s outgoing senators do not unduly affect next year’s senate operations.
“I think it’s important to understand what role we have as the outgoing senate in terms of what happens in one of the future senates,” he said.
Senators unanimously passed the No Place for Hate Act after students demonstrated during their meeting and provided more than a dozen public comments condemning GW Young America’s Foundation for the organizations’ recent transphobic tweets. The act requests the University investigate the organization for a potential code of conduct violation and calls for the temporary suspension of GW YAF.
Senators unanimously voted to appoint David Lee, the current senate deputy chief of staff, and Isabella Nieminen, the secretary of campus services in the executive cabinet, as Student Court justices.
Lee said his background as senate parliamentarian and as deputy chief of staff make him qualified for the spot because these positions gave him an understanding of the SA’s governing documents.
“This understanding of the power of the voting executive and legislative branch will allow me to make rulings that are legal but do not deliberately hurt the mission of the Student Association,” he said.
Senators also unanimously passed resolutions of appreciation for executive senior members like Brandon Hill and his chiefs of staff, senate staff, Deputy Chief of Staff David Lee, Chief of Staff Chris Johnson, and Executive Vice President Kate Carpenter. The AppreciKate Carpenter Resolution thanks Carpenter for “zealously representing” the student body.
“She deserves this 100 percent,” Johnson said.
The next senate meeting will be held May 2 at 8:30 p.m. over Zoom.
