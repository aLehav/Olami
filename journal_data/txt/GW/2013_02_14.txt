Based on its sticker price, GW is one of the most expensive colleges in the country. But GW’s average cost to families is thousands less than most of its peer schools, according to the College Scorecard released by the White House Wednesday.
The online cost comparison tool pegged GW’s cost of attendance at $27,793, including students’ typical grant and scholarship offers. Without aid, a degree would cost about $58,000 a year.
The University was in the middle of the pack, with prices similar to schools including Boston, Tulane, Northwestern and Emory universities – all schools which GW considers its peers. At the pricey end of the spectrum, students pay about $36,834 including scholarships at New York University. Students at Vanderbilt University landed on the other end of the pay scale with a typical yearly rate of $18,993.
President Barack Obama launched the scorecard the day after he asked lawmakers in his State of the Union address to offer incentives, like tying a university’s federal funding to its affordability and value, to keep costs down. He demanded that colleges be held accountable for skyrocketing costs so taxpayers are not forced to “subsidize” higher education.
The scorecard also shows the average students’ debt, graduation rates and employment prospects for each school. Students’ federal borrowing at GW was on the higher end of the scale, with graduates owing an average monthly payment of $256.63 over 10 years. But GW’s loan default rate is just 1.5 percent, compared to the national rate of 13.4 percent, White House data showed.
During his address, Obama also asked lawmakers to hold institutions accountable and offer incentives, like tying a university’s federal funding to its affordability and value, to keep costs down. He pitched the idea as an amendment to the Higher Education Act, which Congress must reauthorize this year.
“Kudos to the administration for putting that out there,” said David Soto, content development director for The Princeton Review. “We think that the more data is out there the better.”
The higher education powerhouse published its 2013 “Best Value Colleges” rankings last week – a list of 150 public and private universities that best combine academic quality with affordability. GW didn’t make the cut to stand among the 75 private colleges delivering the best bang for the buck. Of GW’s peer institutions, only Northwestern University broke into the list.
“Most of the schools on this list do the near impossible and they bring that sticker price down to a number that is good for parents and students,” Soto said.
“Using this list of best value colleges is certainly a good starting point for students and parents concerned about paying for college,” Soto said, urging parents and students to go beyond a school’s listed price in considering affordability.
Cutting costs has been a focus for University President Steven Knapp, who has stepped up fundraising for scholarships cutting down on the burden to students. Under Knapp’s tenure, and since it first broke the $50,000-a-year threshold in 2007, GW mostly shook off its reputation as the most expensive school in the country. It skimmed out of the top 10 on Forbes magazine’s most expensive colleges list in 2010 by just $25. Now, GW sits at No. 40, just $1,270 less than the No. 10-ranked school.
The College Scorecard is similar to information collected by a financial aid “shopping sheet” launched by the Obama administration last summer. GW officials are still mulling the shopping sheet’s merits.
Delivering the Republican rebuttal, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., echoed the president’s calls for increased transparency.
While both commended federal programs that make a bachelor’s degree more affordable, Rubio and Obama called for new approaches to college affordability.

By double majoring in international affairs and environmental studies, senior Jeremy Iloulian fits the classic GW student profile.
But when he needed academic advisers’ help as a freshman and sophomore, he got mixed signals from the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and Elliott School of International Affairs.
“It made it difficult when I had to go back and forth between the two advisers when they weren’t as confident about each other, about the other programs and about how they overlap,” he said.
Iloulian’s case is representative of students’ irritation with advising University-wide for multiple years, according to data provided by the Office of Academic Planning and Assessment. Provost Steven Lerman said Wednesday that GW plans to cross-train advisers, who are cordoned off in separate offices in each college, to handle questions about a wider variety of majors and subjects.
More than half of last year’s graduating seniors said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their first-year faculty advisers in the Columbian College, School of Engineering and Applied Science, School of Public Health and Health Services and School of Medicine and Health Sciences. About 40 percent of graduating seniors last year were dissatisfied with professional advisers in the Elliott School and GW School of Business last year.
Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman, who cautioned that academic advising often draws scorn across higher education, said some students might be irked by advisers who cannot answer academic questions about a different school.
“This cross-training could help that. What students get frustrated on is that they go to their adviser and ask questions about somewhere else and the adviser says ‘I don’t know,’ ” Maltzman said. “Right now, the way we set up our system, there is very little linkage across school advisers.”
Lerman and Maltzman did not know yet when training would start or how much it would cost because the process has not been fully planned.
A Faculty Senate committee of professors and students, on which Iloulian sits, singled out academic advising as a top priority as GW finalizes its 10-year strategic plan within the coming weeks. A task force will convene this spring to reshape undergraduate education and advising as part of the plan.
Applicants could within two years be admitted to the University as a whole, rather than specific schools, to encourage more interdisciplinary work. The new admissions model would also allow students to declare “pre-majors” as a path into the college of their choice, like the School of Media and Public Affairs.
No specific change has been finalized or approved, but the University has pledged to funnel $9 million to $17 million over the next decade into remodeling undergraduate learning, including advising.
Michael Castleberry, chair of the Faculty Senate executive committee, said advising was a hot-button issues during strategic plan discussions.
“We have to come up with a better way to do advising. Students want more from advisers. They want more access to advisers. We need to ramp that up. We need to put money in,” he said.
Castleberry called previous attempts to revamp advising “not adequate.”
In 2010, the University announced a $500,000 effort to double the number of professional advisers in Columbian College from nine to 18. The college reached that number last fall.
The business school also made advising changes two years ago, turning over almost its entire staff and putting advisers in classrooms to lead first-year development courses.
Advisers across schools have also touted the 2011 adaptation of DegreeMAP, an online auditing system that helps students track their degree requirements. The service allows advisers to focus on more substantive discussions with students instead of just helping to track requirements.
Maltzman said he is working on improvements such as allowing students to view “what-if scenarios” in the next year. For example, a student who has not switched majors yet would still be able to project degree requirements.
The academic advising changes would come after the University remolded its career center last year, adding about a dozen new staff members over the next three years to specialize in specific fields.
Lerman said he did not think the University would create a central office for academic advising, opting to keep advising in each college for now so as not to “disrupt the organizational model we have.”
Anna Regan, director of undergraduate Columbian College advising, said the office has made strides to fix the existing model recently work by  adding walk-in hours and more workshops with the career center.
She said the office was also trying to host more student workshops with the Career Center.
“As the plan for admitting all undergraduate students to GW is fleshed out, it will become clearer what changes in advising need to be made to help students choose classes and majors, and make the most out of all the resources GW offers,” Regan said in an email.

Top administrators again refused to adopt the Student Association’s plan to increase student space on campus, but the group’s leaders say they will not shift their priorities for the second half of their term.
SA President Ashwin Narla said he will continue to push for renovations to the Marvin Center, though Provost Steven Lerman and Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz wrote in a public letter Monday that the construction was far from landing on GW’s agenda.
Narla said he will create a task force comprising students and administrators to strike a compromise to expand GW’s student center while the University squeezes in more office space. He said he discussed the idea with Lerman but needs to get approval from University President Steven Knapp next week.
“You need to start at the task force level. That’s how the University operates. It’s how things get done,” Narla said.
Narla said the task force could pinpoint the most effective ways to add student space to every new building project, while working to modernize current space with a focus on the Marvin Center.
He wants students to help decide what kind of space to create in the two basement floors of GW’s new residence hall, the “superdorm,” which will go under construction this summer. Lerman and Katz said in the letter that the space would be devoted to students.
“Whenever we plan new construction and on campus renovations, we seek to provide student spaces that serve a wide range of student needs,” Lerman and Katz wrote. “We believe the best approach is to integrate student spaces into our new buildings and renovations, and this is the approach we have been pursuing.”
Narla was “surprised” that his two proposals on student space, which he said gained traction at the Board of Trustees meeting last week, did not have more clout with the University’s top administrators.
“Its frustrating that the board’s philosophy is not exactly what we talked about in the meeting, and its not what we talked about in the plan,” Narla said at the SA Senate meeting Monday night.
Narla and Executive Vice President Abby Bergren have spent more than six months advocating for more space, and said they are looking forward to further negotiations.
Senior Johannes Schmidt said the need for more space on the maxed-out campus is apparent.
“If we’re paying close to $60,000 a year to be here, there’s no reason that every student shouldn’t have access to space to do what he or she came to college to do, whether that means studying, joining or starting clubs, or sitting around and talking politics with friends,” Schmidt said.
Freshman Ariella Neckritz agreed. She said student “dollars should help foster more school activities.”
“GW should influence and encourage student interests and support creativity and innovation through allowing student organizations adequate space to meet,” Neckritz said.
This year’s feverish attempt to lobby for more space stems from students and campus organizations arguing that they cannot find space to study, hold events and hang out on campus.
GW has taken steps to increase student space in recent years. In 2007, University President Steven Knapp banned outside organizations with no ties to students, faculty or departments from booking space in the Marvin Center.
A student-led renovation converted several rooms on the building’s fourth floor into meeting rooms this year, helping to address the space issue for formal gatherings.
Narla said that is not enough.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said there have been about 6,300 booking in the Marvin Center since Aug. 1, and zero bookings by non-GW parties.
The “University component” mandate has led to increased attendance and interest in events, Assistant Vice President of Events and Venues Michael Peller said, coupled with an increase in student demand for the space.
“Knapp’s regulations have put a singular focus on the issue,” Peller said. “That’s what we’re here for, to provide resources and opportunities for members of our community to participate in.”
Now, nights and weekends are reserved almost solely by students. Weekdays, when students have class, the building is used by outside organizations or University departments.
Eight years ago, the building was rented to unaffiliated organizations to pull in revenue under former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg.
About one-third of Marvin Center room reservations went to students in 2005, compared to 40 percent of space used by students in the 1998-1999 school year. Over this period, non-University group usage of student space doubled to about 13 percent.
Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski, who ran the Marvin Center for three years under Trachtenberg, said the policy change has improved student life on campus. He added the Marvin Center is “a true community space and serves a huge need.”

A freshman is asking the University for $5,000 to help him build a solar-powered picnic table and charging dock he designed to promote outdoor student space.
Economics and political science double major Ben Pryde developed a solar energy generator that doubles as an outdoor table on which students can charge laptops, cell phones and other electronics.
Pryde said the generator will educate people about sustainability, give students a place to gather and encourage collaboration among students of different fields.
“We want this to be planned by GW, built by GW and funded by GW. Our goal is to make this clearly a GW thing in all aspects, and I think it would really show how committed GW is to sustainability and how much students are committed to sustainability,” he said.
The table, which is designed to operate year-round, would have a total of 23 outlets. Pryde said it would be able to charge 23 cell phones or about five laptops at once on just solar power. Even without sunlight, the generator can operate on battery power and would be able to charge 23 cell phones for 31 days and 23 laptops for two days.
His top choice for the location is Kogan Plaza. University Yard and Square 80 are other possible locations.
Pryde, also a Student Association senator, submitted the proposal to administrators last week. He said he hopes to see the unit installed before the end of the semester and would like the University to fund more tables in the future.
The SA Senate passed a resolution Monday to ask the University to finance supplies to have students make one table.
Pryde designed and constructed a smaller version of the table with a classmate during his senior year of high school in Seattle. Their design won Best Investment at the 2012 Zino Green Society Investment Forum in the Seed Company competition.
The Office of Sustainability and GW’s sustainability committee are reviewing the proposal and could suggest improvements. He plans to work with the Office of Sustainability and the Department of Facilities to work out funding.
“The Office of Sustainability is thrilled to see that students are developing their own innovative solutions to sustainability challenges, even on campus. It is that entrepreneurial spirit that drives positive change,” said Meghan Chapple-Brown, director of the Office of Sustainability.
Ken Zweibel, director of GW’s Solar Institute and research professor of energy, said the charging unit has a “well thought out design.”
“It seems like a pretty cool idea in the sense that it would be able to show the use of solar energy for the student body,” Zweibel said.
Zweibel said the estimated cost for each unit seems feasible, but that the overall cost for charging a phone on the unit will be more expensive than plugging into a wall socket. Construction costs – which includes a large frame, a battery, many wires and multiple sockets – make the unit more expensive than most solar devices, which are simply modules on a support frame.
Pryde estimated that construction would take between two and four weeks. He said the Residence Hall Association and Green GW both have expressed interest in providing manpower to help put the units together.
“We’ve gotten a lot of student support for it. Every time I tell someone about it, they want to work on it. It interests engineers, political science majors, fine arts majors; basically in any field, people have been interested in it,” he said.
Green GW called the charging station “a great visible reminder of GW’s commitment to sustainability,” the group’s president Isabelle Riu said.

At colleges and universities across the country, business is emerging as one of the most popular majors.
But there’s been a campus dialogue as to whether or not business students are getting a well-rounded education.
As a result, GW has begun to rethink the business school curriculum and will consider offering a Bachelor of Science in finance. With this change, which The Board of Trustees could vote on later this year, business students will have the opportunity to take a broader range of classes sometime in the future.
But in the same vein, liberal arts students should have an opportunity to expand their horizons as well.
All students should graduate from GW knowing something about business. That’s why the University should consider mandating that all students take a business course before they graduate – even if it isn’t their major.
The University is beginning to make strides in this area. In the fall, the Center for Student Engagement will start to offer weekly seminars called “Big Adult Topics” which will cover issues like how to file your own taxes and plan for retirement. For some, these seminars may be unnecessary. But it’s encouraging to see University administrators trying to help prepare students for the financial realities they will face in their adult lives.
Although GW is an institution that prides itself on providing students a global perspective and comprehensive understanding of the world, it’s still possible for students to graduate having never learned anything having to do with the economy. As the University reorganizes itself under a one-college model, GW should ensure that every student graduates knowing something about the economy and world markets.
To do this, GW could designate an introductory business course required for all students. The central goal of the course would be to expose the basics of the business world to students who are not necessarily familiar with financial investments or even the process of doing taxes.
There’s a lot to admire about business courses. For example, they don’t simply teach students the intricacies of markets but also place students in positions where they must collaborate with their peers. Business degrees, maybe more than any other degree, teach students problem solving skills and how to work in groups – both of which are necessary in most fields.
There are a number of higher-level economics courses taught in the business school that would not apply to the average student. And the general student body is not interested in studying financial markets and product placement.
However, everyone, no matter their major, could benefit from a basic understanding of the business world if for no other reason than that having taken a class in finance or economics.
Getting a job is ultimately what we’re here for, and this simple addition to the curriculum could give all students a leg up when searching for full-time employment.

Education was a cornerstone of President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address Tuesday.
He unveiled his plan to create a “College Scorecard” to help prospective college students educate themselves about the financial side of college.
The proposal was officially released Wednesday – and it is essential that members on both sides of the aisle act to make this idea a reality.
“Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it’s our job to make sure they do,” Obama said in his speech.
Students at GW are no strangers to high tuition costs. The tuition for this year’s incoming class will be $47,343 – and that’s excluding room and board. And while this 3.3 percent increase from last year’s tuition is not quite as steep of an incline as that of other private universities, this school is still notorious for its hefty price tag.
To educate students on how much they will have to pay before they matriculate, the University has established a cost calculator – pursuant to a federal requirement from 2009. The purpose of the calculator is to inform students about how much their tuition will cost after projecting their financial aid package.
But students are still left with a lot of unanswered questions. There’s more to the story of college affordability than just tuition costs. Obama’s new College Scorecard is much more expansive than the University’s existing system, and this transparency will benefit students far more.
In addition to listing tuition costs, Obama’s proposed scorecard takes a more comprehensive look at details like graduation rates, average college debt, likelihood of graduation and earnings potential after college to help students make informed decisions about where to get the best deal.
Paying for college is quite a predicament, especially at GW, where in 2011, the average student debt upon graduation was $32,714, and 45 percent of students graduated with debt, according to the Project on Student Debt. And as college costs increase in the future, so will the number of students who struggle to afford college.
Congress would be mistaken to ignore the president’s call to hold universities accountable.
Associate Vice President for Financial Assistance Dan Small has voiced his hesitation to adopt a shopping sheet already provided by the federal government to help prospective students compare college costs. He said looking at numbers out of context oversimplifies the situation.
Students should have as much access to financial details as possible.
Granted, independent organizations already offer lists and information about colleges that offer the best value. But a scorecard compiled by the federal government would be key in standardizing this information. It would also ensure that details are as accurate as possible – instead of being driven by the corporate interests of a private institution.
In the segment of the speech that focused on education, Obama didn’t just talk about colleges and universities. He also proposed sweeping reform to American preschools, calling for state governments to work to ensure that all students, starting as early as three years old, receive a quality preschool education.
Expanding the opportunity to attend preschool to more students will be a costly endeavor – albeit a worthwhile one. But creating a college scorecard won’t drain the national budget like other existing programs such as defense spending and health care.
It’s the most logical step to move our higher education system forward.

The men’s basketball team lost 59-56 last weekend to No. 14 Butler in the final seconds of the game. Down by 17 at one point, the Colonials narrowed the lead to only three. In the end, the men’s team just couldn’t sink the three-point shot to tie it up.
Still, the game was not a complete loss. The Colonials played for a sold-out crowd of students and alumni. Win or lose, the game was a clear victory for campus spirit and student involvement. Raise High.
Student discontent with J Street is nothing new. Prices are high and the food quality is poor. For a bottle of water, the campus dining hall charges $1.69, yet students could just as easily get a bottle of water at Whole Foods Market for 79 cents. To turn a profit with the existing contract, it seems that students are charged more than should be the case.
Part of the problem is the restrictive contract between the University and food provider Sodexo. The discrepancy between J Street and other campus eateries is striking, and is an ongoing problem that seems to have no easy solution.
The Center for Student Engagement director Tim Miller made great strides this week through two instructive and innovative programs that will start in the fall. The CSE’s move to offer instructional seminars on financial topics like filing taxes and saving for retirement is a step in the right direction when it comes to educating well rounded students.
To help students transition to college life and make the best decisions when it comes to positive eating habits, the CSE has announced that in the fall, it will pay for a dietician to visit freshman residence halls to promote a healthier dietary culture on campus.
Increasingly, students attend college not just to obtain a quality education, but also to become productive citizens. And these CSE initiatives are a commendable step to fulfill that responsibility.
The cost of college tuition is a perennial problem across the nation. But it’s an issue that looms especially large at GW, which, at $47,343 next year, is one of the top 50 most expensive universities in the country, according to Forbes magazine.
Granted, administrators have increased tuition at a steady rate of about 3 percent for the last six years, less than most other private colleges and universities, which had an average increase of 4.2 percent. And the University has also pledged to maintain the fixed tuition system, meaning that students will pay a flat fee for their entire education.
But still, the question must be asked: How high can the price of higher education soar before the system becomes unsustainable?
In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Barack Obama made higher education a priority by announcing his plan for a college scorecard. The theory behind this proposal is that providing students with financial information about universities across the country will help them make better decisions before they choose where to enroll.
At a time when college costs are skyrocketing and more students than ever are saddling tens of thousands of dollars of debt, the president’s decision to hold institutions of higher education responsible for their financial decisions is laudable.
Prospective students who are considering applying to GW – which has a yearly price tag nearing $60,000 – could benefit from increased access to financial information.
