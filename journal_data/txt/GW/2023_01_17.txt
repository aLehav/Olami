The average salary for tenured and tenure-track CCAS professors was $151,439 for the 2021-22 academic year – about 25 percent lower than GW’s average tenured and tenure-track salary of $200,589 across seven schools. 
Updated: April 18, 2023, at 12:52 p.m.
Tenured and tenure-track faculty in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences have the second-lowest average salaries out of seven of GW’s 12 schools while serving the most undergraduates out of any GW school on campus, according to a University report last month.
Provost Chris Bracey said in a report at a Faculty Senate meeting last month that the average salary for tenured and tenure-track CCAS professors was $151,439 during the 2021-22 academic year – about 25 percent lower than GW’s average tenured and tenure-track salary of $200,589 across CCAS, GW Law, the School of Business, the Milken Institute School of Public Health, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Graduate School of Education and Human Development and the Elliott School of International Affairs. CCAS faculty said the school’s average salary is lower than those of their peers in STEM and business disciplines at GW.
Paul Wahlbeck, the dean of CCAS, declined to say why the average salary for CCAS tenured and tenure-track professors is lower than the averages for GW’s other schools or how officials determine salaries for professors across schools.
“CCAS greatly values the work of our faculty and their commitment to GW’s educational and research mission,” Wahlbeck said in an email.
Wahlbeck said officials have “worked diligently” over the past “several” years to increase CCAS faculty salaries. He said officials bumped up the merit increase they implemented for tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty in 2021 and increased the average salaries of non-tenure-track assistant and associate professors last year.
Wahlbeck said Bracey’s report at last month’s senate meeting does not reflect the salary merit increases officials issued in summer 2022 because it only contains data from the 2021-22 academic year. He said Bracey’s report also does not include the salaries of professors on yearlong sabbaticals.
Ivy Ken, a tenured associate professor of sociology in CCAS, said the University often rationalizes giving more raises to STEM and business professors to encourage professors to stay at GW and deter them from seeking “lucrative” employment options elsewhere. She said the University does not apply the same rationale to social science and humanities professors receiving job offers from other universities or employers outside academia.
GWSB, Milken and GW Engineering ranked second, third and fourth out of GW’s academic schools for average salary for tenured and tenure-track faculty during the 2021-22 academic year with $230,615, $211,488 and $200,337, respectively, according to the report.
“I have worked at GW for 22 years, and I just broke $100,000 about a year ago,” Ken said in an email. “The only way to increase my salary is to get an offer from another university, and I don’t want to waste anybody’s time doing that.”
Ken said GW’s system of faculty compensation does not reward faculty members for their “loyalty, excellence or service,” but rather on whether faculty members could receive well-paying job offers outside of GW.
“Students should also know that the quality of a professor’s teaching has almost nothing to do with whether they are paid well,” she said. “Some of the worst teachers are most highly paid, and loads of terrific teachers get scraps. It’s a demoralizing game, and lots of us lose.”
Tatiyana Apanasovich, an associate professor of statistics in CCAS, said while salaries at GW may not appear drastically lower than other American universities, the high cost of living in and around D.C. makes it difficult for professors to live off GW’s current salaries.
Living in and near D.C. costs 53 percent more than the national average cost of living, according to WTOP News.
“If I compare my salary to someone somewhere in the middle of the country in a rural area, the living expenses are much lower, so here, I cannot afford to buy a house, that’s kind of reality,” Apanasovich said.
Apanasovich said six professors have left her department, which currently hosts 19 full-time faculty members, over the past 10 years after receiving higher-paying offers from other institutions, including one faculty member who left GW for Georgetown University.
The average salary for faculty with the title of “professor” across all GW schools for the 2021-2022 academic year was $189,700, whereas at Georgetown University, the average salary was $221,300, according to the senate report.
“I know it’s really, really hard to negotiate salaries with GW because they just really don’t want to pay more,” Apanasovich said.
A tenured professor in CCAS, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern of retribution from the University, said after holding the title of professor for seven years, their salary is still comparable to the average salary of an associate professor at GW, one level below his professor position.
The faculty member said low salaries often incentivize CCAS faculty to search for other jobs because they feel they need more compensation for their work when they would otherwise prefer to stay employed at the University.
“It is a shame because, in many cases, the faculty member really wants to stay at GW, but the financial reality of low salary may force them to move,” they said.
Harald Griesshammer, a tenured professor of physics in CCAS, said salaries for professors working in the arts and humanities are on average lower than the professors’ salaries in fields like physics, chemistry and economics because they have limited job opportunities outside of academia and more competition for professor positions within their field of study. He said this compensation system decreases many humanities professors’ salaries because universities can pay them less without having to compete with industries outside of academia, but the majority of people entering the higher education industry are aware of the disparity.
“We’re never going to end up with something that’s even approaching comparable between the disciplines, and the reason is just the American system,” Griesshammer said.
Griesshammer said GW looks for outliers and makes adjustments to salaries within departments, but differences in employment demand between disciplines make it difficult to compare salaries across an entire school.
“I do know that GW and CCAS wants to make sure that within a department everybody gets the fair salary, but I think between departments, between disciplines, between schools, it’s a much harder thing,” Griesshammer said.

28-year-old criminology graduate student Bryan Kohberger appeared in court for the first time last week after being charged in late December with the murder of four University of Idaho students, granting closure to the victims’ families who must still be dealing with unimaginable grief as they piece together the tragic details of what happened to their children. Kohberger’s arrest also brought a sense of relief to a different crowd struck by the effects of the killings – the multiple individuals accused of murder by true crime content creators on TikTok.
The Nov. 13 murder of Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, shocked the nation and left millions with unanswered questions about why and how these senseless killings occurred. But instead of leaving the investigating to the real detectives assigned to this case, a slew of true crime content creators accused several innocent people of murder without any credible evidence whatsoever, gaining notoriety and followers in the process. Media does not exist in a vacuum – true crime content creators’ posts impact the real lives of the individuals involved in this horrific situation, and they need to learn how to act with sensitivity, not harassment, toward the victims and families involved.
Fellow Idaho student Jack Showalter, Goncalves’ ex-boyfriend Jack DuCoeur and University of Idaho history professor Rebecca Scofield have each been the target of endless online harassment and threats in the midst of this ongoing investigation, with some content creators persisting even after Kohberger was named a suspect and taken into custody. Scofield is even suing TikTok true crime blogger Ashley Guillard, who still claims that Scofield was involved in a relationship with Goncalves and murdered all four students.
If you find yourself asking why much of the social media coverage around the Idaho case resembles a TV show, it’s not a coincidence. The last decade has seen an insurmountable rise in true crime as an entertainment genre. Podcasts like “Crime Junkie” and “My Favorite Murder” have cult-like followings and cover everything from little-known unsolved cases to infamous murders, while controversial series like Netflix’s “Dahmer” have amassed billions of views. While there is nothing inherently wrong with being interested in true crime, the behavior of self-proclaimed internet sleuths in the true crime media sphere on TikTok demonstrates how our cultural obsession with true crime has gone too far.
The public’s unfathomably cruel response to 19-year-old Dylan Mortensen – one of the two surviving roommates in the off-campus home where Kernodle, Mogen and Goncalves also lived – has been most shocking. The chilling 19-page affidavit released this month describes how Mortensen came face to face with the murderer as he was exiting the home before locking herself in her room for hours fearing that he might return. He did. Kohberger’s cell phone pinged at the residence around 9 a.m. the next morning. Thousands of strangers on the internet have vilified Mortensen for her decision not to call 911 immediately and even suggested she has something to do with the murder of her best friends.
The reality is that no one commenting on Mortensen’s actions knows how they would have behaved in her situation. But we can assume that Mortensen acted in a state of shock, as most teenagers would, after realizing she was just seconds away from becoming a murder victim herself. To continue to torment a young woman who has just gone through an unimaginably horrific event instead of blaming the suspect in custody is unspeakably vile. This desensitization is the product of conflating true crime with entertainment.
The oversaturation of true crime in our media landscape – in shows, documentaries, podcasts and on TikTok – has resulted in a complete detachment of human empathy and a disconnect from the very real victims and family members at the center of these viral cases, blurring the line between entertainment and real life. When true crime commentators and internet sleuths begin to view the victims and near victims of this crime as characters in a TV show, they become desensitized enough to spread damaging rhetoric like the insults hurled at Mortensen.
But not every single true crime content creator who has posted videos about this case has acted with malice. The popular #idaho4 hashtag used on TikTok to spread news and updates about the case currently has 1.1 billion views, many of which are from videos in support of Mortensen and the wrongfully accused suspects. But the unsettling truth is that a considerable amount of people posting under the hashtag view this case as entertainment and a mystery to solve. While it is human nature to be curious and even fascinated by criminology, our wildest speculations about this case must end there – in private. Broadcasting bizarre theories on TikTok for the world to see only further traumatizes the family members involved.
If there is anything we can learn from these devastating murders of four bright, young people, it’s that there is no ethical way to create social media content theorizing and sleuthing this early into a developing case, especially one concerning homicide. These creators are capitalizing on a tragedy for views and internet fame, damaging their young and impressionable audiences who may genuinely want to learn about the facts of the case only to come away with conspiracies and misinformation.
In rapidly unfolding cases like the Idaho murders, we should leave the detective work to the detectives assigned to the case. Theorize, wonder and research privately instead of demonizing and defaming innocent individuals online. It’s time we come to a serious cultural reckoning about the dire effects of how we approach true crime. We need to draw the line between meaningful curiosity and mindless entertainment to avoid becoming desensitized to these nationally captivating cases.

Kamau Louis is a member of the class of 2022 and former opinions writer for The Hatchet.
Though I graduated from GW last semester, this University has a special place in my heart. It’s where I had my first love and first heartbreak, found brotherhood and made lifelong friendships. Yet, despite priding themselves on creating change on campus, GW community members are missing the problem in front of them. In 2022, I was one of the only 779 Black men in GW’s total student population of 25,939, just three percent of the student body.
The inclusion of Black men in the University community is key to fostering a much more equal society, but GW’s population of wealthy, privately educated and suburban students has likely had limited experiences with Black people. And it shows. In spring 2020, a freshman told me I was her first Black friend – we’d only known each other for two weeks. I have been confused for other Black men on campus by other students, some of whom I don’t share a resemblance with at all. These experiences were very shocking and negatively affected my idea of my individuality.
It can be isolating when you look around and no one looks like you. And while I as a Black man have been accepted and greeted with warm welcomes the majority of the time by other students, my peers have also greeted me with awkward smiles or an air of nervousness. Subconsciously, I know some people might stereotype me as violent, aggressive and even as a sexual predator. These stereotypes have led to many Black men and boys dying, like in the case of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, whom a neighborhood watch member named George Zimmerman shot and killed 30 minutes away from my home in Florida in 2012. These thoughts are always in the back of my mind and affect how I interact with others.
All of these subconscious fears can be frustrating and stressful, but as a Black man, you sadly learn that this is the status quo in predominantly white spaces like GW. But Black men who make it to college are the lucky ones, in a twisted way of thinking. Black families, who have lower median household incomes than Asian, white and Hispanic families, can’t always afford the cost of college. We can end up entangled in the criminal justice system – by age 23, 49 percent of Black men have been arrested, according to a 2014 study, and Black men are especially likely to be imprisoned, even as incarceration rates have decreased since 2006. And victims of gun violence are mostly young, male and Black.
I have heard white students discuss their desire to be changemakers, but that doesn’t always pan out in reality. In a class discussion about a proposal from Georgetown University students to pay a $27 semesterly fee in reparations to the descendants of the slaves Georgetown sold in 1838 to avoid bankruptcy, my classmates got mad that other students would have to pay the fee instead of Georgetown as an institution. College students get far more frivolous things for $27, like overpriced cocktails, Ubers and fake IDs. And even though my Caribbean ancestors had nothing to do with the enslavement of the Black people who built Georgetown, I wouldn’t mind donating to help people who have suffered from generational poverty and inequality over the decades. How do these students think they’re going to make change and help people when they won’t put their money where their mouth is, let alone venture to the Target in Columbia Heights because it’s “shady”?
To cultivate a space for Black men at GW where they can feel more comfortable and accepted, first increase the amount of Black male students and Black students overall at GW. Considering that 45.8 percent of D.C. residents are Black as of 2022 according to Census data, GW should start making more inroads to predominantly Black public high schools in the area, like Dunbar High School and Jackson-Reed High School. In 2022, only 66 undergraduate students out of GW’s 1,690 students from D.C. were Black men. Granted, GW offers a $7,500 scholarship called the District Scholars program to D.C. residents but those funds only cover a fraction of tuition.
The University also competes with Howard University. At D.C.’s illustrious historically Black university, 2,418 students were Black men and 2,238 students were from D.C. out of a population of 12,886 students in 2022. Like every university, Howard rejects many talented applicants who can’t afford its $52,000 tuition. I ended up attending GW because it offered enough financial aid that made the cost of attendance more affordable than Howard.
Second, increase the amount of Black faculty at GW. To its credit, 18.7 percent of GW’s faculty is Black, while Black faculty make up only six percent of college faculty nationwide. But hiring more Black professors along with other minority groups can only help improve GW with a more diverse range of perspectives. Seeing accomplished men who look like me, like geography professor Dr. Moses Kasanga and political science professor Dr. Andrew Thompson, has made me feel comfortable and like I belong at GW. And Vice President Charles Barber and Provost Chris Bracey, both of whom are Black men, hold high positions within the University’s administration. The brotherhood and connection that I felt with other Black men on this campus feeds into that sense of belonging as well. To see people who look like me gives me hope that I can reach such heights.
From professors to students to staff, the people I met at GW for the most part have made an effort to make this University feel like a home away from home for me. I did feel at home at GW, but this home was not always perfect. Yet working to improve your home is all that matters. GW has a bright future ahead if it can close the gap for Black men.

To the tune of bossa nova and smooth jazz, the crowd in the lobby of the School of Media and Public Affairs shuffled into the Jack Morton Auditorium Wednesday and took their seats to await the introduction of GW’s next president. But they wouldn’t be sitting for very long. Officials introduced Ellen Granberg as the University’s 19th president to a standing ovation and raucous applause at the public event, signaling the start of a new chapter in GW’s history.
After 200 years and 18 presidents, Granberg will be GW’s first female and first openly LGBTQ+ president in the University’s history. So as the University’s next president embarks on an official transition process that ends with her and her wife, Sonya Rankin, moving into F Street House later this year, allow us to impart our own advice as well.
Officials chose Granberg – a former Clemson University sociology professor, department chair, associate provost for faculty affairs, senior associate provost and the current provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at Rochester Institute of Technology since 2018 – after a presidential search process that began in earnest last spring. But the effort to find GW’s next permanent president dates back to spring 2021, when then-University President Thomas LeBlanc announced he would step down from his position at the end of the year after years of tension with faculty, students and staff.
With Granberg’s takeover later this year making her GW’s third president in three years, LeBlanc’s presidency can seem like a distant memory. But all of us, including Granberg, are living in the GW LeBlanc built, or, depending on your perspective, nearly destroyed. Thus, a whirlwind tour of LeBlanc’s time at GW serves as a what not-to-do list for Granberg.
Once he arrived on campus, the consistent erosion of trust between faculty, the administration and the Board of Trustees marred his time at the helm of GW. A $300,000 partnership with the Disney Institute to assess GW’s culture in 2018 earned the criticism of faculty for failing to accurately measure their feedback and exemplifying arbitrary and top-down decision making. Likewise, LeBlanc’s plan to increase STEM enrollment while decreasing the number of students enrolled across the entire University, particularly within the humanities, divided the Board of Trustees and faculty, who contested the plan would lower the diversity of the student population and harm the University’s revenue.
But issues with shared governance remain even into Wrighton’s transitory tenure, including in the same presidential search process that selected Granberg. Despite unanimously passing a set of shared governance principles in May, the 17-member Presidential Search Committee had one staff representative, Caroline Laguerre-Brown, the vice provost for diversity, equity and community engagement, and one student, Student Association President Christian Zidouemba. And Laguerre-Brown’s upper-level administrative role did not reflect GW’s staff as a whole, noted one staff member who participated in the community feedback forums held last September. 
Nor were things much better with the student body whom LeBlanc never seemed to get along with during his presidency. He described critical nonscience and engineering students as “privileged” on a hot mic while defending naming National Academy of Sciences President Marcia McNutt as Commencement speaker in 2018. In 2020, LeBlanc announced then later apologized for the decision to hire Heather Swain – a former Michigan State University official criticized for her involvement in the investigation of Larry Nassar, the MSU doctor and USA Gymnastics coach sentenced to decades in prison for multiple sex crimes. Most notably, LeBlanc compared support for fossil fuel divestment among students to hypothetical support for shooting “all the Black people here” in a ham-fisted, racist analogy in 2020.
Respecting the University’s culture and avoiding insensitive remarks are minimum expectations that Granberg must aspire to surpass. Unlike Wrighton – who focused on strengthening GW’s financial aid resources, improving diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on campus and generally soothing the discontent LeBlanc’s unpopular presidency created – Granberg will have the time to create a more long-term strategic vision for GW. For as much as we have discussed LeBlanc’s many shortcomings here and elsewhere, it is now finally time to move on from him. This University needs a leader who can guide it into its third century and the 21st century – one defined by cooperation and communication, not antagonism and authoritarianism.
On shared governance, diversity, equity and inclusion and her own strategic vision, Granberg must transform principles and statements into actual reality. But the core of GW’s identity, a world-class education in the nation’s capital, must remain intact. Granberg must enhance and enrich what this University already offers, like its financially challenged medical enterprise or long-suffering humanities department. A focus on transparent and honest communication and a mindset that values the student experience as much as GW’s financial health would be a marked departure from previous administrations, too.
Granberg’s identity as GW’s first woman and first openly LGBTQ+ president also sets her apart from the University’s past 21 permanent or interim presidents, all of whom have been straight, white men. Though who Granberg is cannot tell us how she will lead GW at this early stage, we hope she will be more attuned to the sensitivities of the University community than previous presidents.
We hope Granberg and her wife will be a visible presence around campus, stopping by events in University Yard and attending games in the Smith Center. If they don’t have a pet already, we suggest following the lead of the Wrightons and finding a furry friend who can also appear throughout Foggy Bottom.
For our part, The Hatchet’s editorial board will strive to offer a firm but fair analysis of both Granberg’s performance and Wrighton’s remaining time as president. Good luck to them – and to you – this semester.
The editorial board consists of Hatchet staff members and operates separately from the newsroom. This week’s staff editorial was written by Opinions Editor Ethan Benn and Contributing Opinions Editor Julia Koscelnik, based on discussions with Research Assistant Zachary Bestwick, Sports Editor Nuria Diaz, Managing Editor Jaden DiMauro, Culture Editor Clara Duhon, Design Editor Grace Miller and Contributing Social Media Director Ethan Valliath.

The team’s shooting average was due in large part to the team’s shot selection in addition to quick, steady ball movement that found open players in the paint that helped them keep the 12-point run in the fourth quarter.
Women’s basketball suffered its second consecutive loss in A-10 conference play against George Mason in Virginia Monday 67-57, tainting their conference record. 
The Colonials (11-8, 3-3) whittled a 20-point deficit down to just 8 points, but a second-quarter, game-low 28 percent shooting from the field kept GW from taking control of the game in the final frame. The Patriots were met with little resistance from GW, connecting on more than 50 percent of shots from the floor and shooting at a .667 percent clip from behind the 3-point line.
The Colonials held their lowest 3-point shooting percentage in 19 games, only hitting four of their 25 shots, a stark reminder of last season’s jarring beyond-the-arc average that amounted to .343 percent. 
Three Colonials scored in double digits, led by graduate student guard Mia Lakstigala who netted 14 points for a spectacular showing off the bench. Senior guard Nya Lok chipped in 12 points and five boards while redshirt senior forward Mayowa Taiwo scored 10 points.
GW opened the game with a quick 8-4 scoring run while the Patriots faced a two-minute scoring drought as the Colonials’ defense kept them from taking possession with frequent turnovers that turned into points in the paint for GW. A layup by Patriots senior forward Nalani Kaysia ended the dry spell and kickstarted a 9-point run that tied the game 17-17 heading to the second quarter. 
Lakstigala made her mark early in the game, scoring 4 points to go along with a turnover prior to the first stoppage on her way to a 14-point, five-rebound performance that suffocated George Mason’s interior offense. 
The second quarter was a back-and-forth battle with five lead changes in just the first six minutes, but the Patriots took advantage of the 3-point line to establish a 9-point differential. The Colonials were only able to shave 4 points off the Patriots’ lead with a jumper from graduate student guard Jayla Thorton and two layups from Taiwo.
Junior guard Asjah Inniss dished out one assist and picked up a steal in the second quarter to help the GW offense settle back into the game. The Patriots finished the half off with a layup, extending the lead to 35-30 while the Colonials continued to fall behind on both sides of the court.
The Patriots stifled the Colonials’ offense in the third quarter, recording a 21-12 run after missing eight 3-pointers throughout the quarter that cost them any chances of regaining their lead. George Mason took advantage of their defense to increase their turnover ratio by five after multiple missed attempts at the arc from GW.
In the fourth quarter, the Colonials set a 12-6 run looking to gather a final boost to outscore the Patriots as Lakstigala netted in 6 points from the paint. GW kept the Patriots from entering their paint by taking advantage of offensive rebounds and blocking shots from the 3-point line. 
The Colonials were only able to net in 2 points in the final minute of the game leading to the 67-57 loss since they could only cut down the differential by 10 points.
The team’s shooting average was due in large part to the team’s shot selection in addition to quick, steady ball movement that found open players in the paint that helped them keep the 12-point run in the fourth quarter.
The Colonials will take on VCU at the Smith Center Jan. 22 at noon.

Beyond maxi skirts, denim is resurging in a magnitude of looks. The beauty of this trend is that denim is both sturdy and timeless, making it one of the most reliably stylish fabrics of all time, easy to be repurposed year after year.
2023 is the year of closet couture.
Investing in the new year’s fashion trends doesn’t mean you have to overhaul your wardrobe. In fact, everything you need to stay in style might already be in your clothing collection.
From repurposing preloved denim to raiding your family and friends’ closets – with their permission of course – there are many ways you can sustainably embrace this year’s resurging trends while still sporting the tried-and-true items that make up your personal style. Here are some of 2023’s upcoming fashion trends and ways you can partake in them without spending a dime.
No more mini’s
Chances are you’ve become accustomed to the shorter hemlines and shrinking sizes of accessories during the past few years, but 2023 promises to embrace the opposite.
Inspired by the convenience of canvas totes, many trendsetters are styling their going-out outfits with bigger purses instead of the tiny shoulder bags of late. You may have a medium-sized or even oversized purse from the early 2000s or 2010s lying in your closet waiting to be dusted off and reused. My go-to clothing search starts before I even think about shopping or thrifting. And it involves, if not first rifling through my own wardrobe, combing through my siblings’ and parents’ closet when I’m home over break. Because if the past trends have taught us anything, it’s that old trends are just aching to become new again.
Decked out in denim
Similarly, the mini hemline finds itself a competitor in 2023. You’ve probably already seen a revival of longer skirts and dresses, but the maxi denim skirt is making a comeback this year.
And beyond the maxi skirts, denim is resurging in a magnitude of looks. The beauty of this trend is that denim is both sturdy and timeless, making it one of the most reliably stylish fabrics of all time, easy to be repurposed year after year. And lucky for us, jagged patchwork and exposed seamlines only add to the spunk of 2023 trendy denim pieces. So if you’re up for reworking an old pair of jeans into a long denim skirt or putting together an oversized Canadian tux, this trend may be for you.
On Wednesdays we wear black
Our tendency to pick up trends from popular entertainment isn’t new – just think of the 2020’s sudden corset obsession following the release of “Bridgerton,” “Emma” and other regency era films released in the past few years. So it’s no surprise that after Netflix’s success with its recent Addams Family reboot series, “Wednesday,” the show’s modern gothic style would venture off-screen and into our closets.
To lean into this trend, center your concept around the darker-colored clothes in your closet. The character Wednesday wears a range of gothic styles inspired by aesthetics from dark academia to oversized streetwear and even upscale glam. Try styling an outfit with black, white and darker pieces in your closet. Dark clogs or chunky loafers, trousers and a black sweater or cardigan layered over a white-collared button-down can replicate Wednesday’s everyday look. Pay a subtle homage to the dress in her distinct, viral dance scene with a sheer top accessorized with a dark choker.
Carrying in cargo 
For those who jumped on the cargo pants bandwagon after it regained popularity last year, you’re in luck, because the functional attire’s popularity has yet to dwindle. Keep sporting your cargo this year in every color from the beige browns to the army-style forest greens and camo, or whatever version you have in your closet.
And cargo pants’ versatility doesn’t end with its ability to carry the contents of your entire backpack, they also go with a variety of tops. Match a fitted tank top or cropped shirt with the baggy pants to achieve a more balanced look, or pair the pants with an oversized graphic tee to achieve a skater-inspired outfit.
Oversized everything
In line with the cargo look, the oversized streetwear trend still reigns supreme in 2023. Taking inspiration from the popular 90’s style, you can follow this trend with ease.
If you have any oversized items in your closet, try matching baggy jeans with oversized t-shirts or hoodies. As with many other 2023 trends, the oversized look is versatile and can easily be dressed up or down. Glam up with stacked jewelry, a sleek pair of glasses and kitten heals. You can also opt for a fitted top like a corset or a crop top to elevate the outfit. If you want to lean toward the relaxed version of the trend, try wearing your favorite beat up sneakers or a pair of chunky platform kicks.
