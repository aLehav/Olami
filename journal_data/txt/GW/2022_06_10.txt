The Student Association Senate passed a bill calling on the university to improve graduate housing and voted to confirm candidates for the executive cabinet.
After officials announced late last month that they planned on selling the Aston, which has housed law students since 2007, the SA Senate unanimously passed the Graduate Housing Disappointment Act and reiterated its plea for officials to provide multiple options for graduate student housing. The SA Senate also voted to confirm Student Association President Christian Zidouemba’s chiefs of staff, legislator general and executive secretary of internal affairs, but rejected the proposed communications director candidate.
SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, Law-G, who sponsored the Graduate Housing Disappointment Act, said the University never acknowledged that it received an act passed by last year’s senate that also called for increased on-campus housing for graduate students. Ingraham said university housing is preferable for low-income students because they can use federal loans to pay for housing, rather than finding new payment means like a bank or familial loans.
“This Act calls on the University to consider options for offering on-campus graduate housing as soon as possible and to bring graduate student leaders to the table to discuss options that will raise the standard of graduate student life higher on our campus,” he said.
Senators voted 17-1-1 to approve Zidouemba’s chiefs of staff, legislator general and treasurer.
Senators also confirmed Zak Zethner, Zidouemba’s executive secretary of internal affairs 16-2-1, but they failed to confirm Aiza Saeed as communications director 13-5-1, missing the two-thirds majority required.
Zidouemba said he plans to add an executive secretary of graduate student and academic affairs to better represent students as he continues to nominate cabinet members. He said the addition of these two positions in exchange for smaller positions previously within the cabinet further decreases the size of his already historically small cabinet.
“More broadly, this cabinet structure will help reduce the overall size of the cabinet,” he said.
SA Vice President Yan Xu thanked Dean Cissy Petty and Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Mark Diaz for their service to the University after they announced their planned retirements at the end of the month. He said he has reached out to the deans of graduate schools and sub-schools to fill the 23 current vacancies in the SA Senate.
“Many of them, I would say half of those deans or directors already replied,” he said. “And they said they will send out communication as soon as possible to encourage graduate student apply for senate and other kinds of nomination we have open for those students.”
The SA Senate unanimously approved the Dean Petty Appreciation Act, sponsored by Executive Vice President Xu. The Act outlines Dean Petty’s various responsibilities and accomplishments, thanks her for “more than four years” of service and wishes her well in future endeavors.
The next senate meeting will be held June 13 at 8:30 p.m. over Zoom.

Tapscott said he is thankful for those who have supported and fostered connections to the MSSC through speaker events, alumni programming and social media during his tenure.
Multicultural Student Services Center Director Michael Tapscott announced his plans to retire after nearly 19 years at the University in an email Wednesday.
Tapscott worked to support underrepresented students through his influence over University policy and wider efforts to improve diversity and inclusion during his time at GW which began in 2003. He said in the email that he felt now was the time to retire following the two years of virtual MSSC programming due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent departures of MSSC staff members.
“Honestly speaking, it’s just time,” Tapscott said in an email sent to students. “After COVID-19, the departure of an amazing staff, the two years spent virtually and the numbers associated with my next birthday… I don’t think I can build back better the kind of MSSC that fed 19 years of amazing experiences and memories.”
Tapscott said his primary goal as MSSC director was to help students have a positive experience at GW that was similar to his own time at Tufts University, where he graduated in 1977.
“The faculty, staff, and senior administration were connected to our Black/Minority community in a way that fostered trust through their constant drive to advocate for us,” the email states. “I love my alma mater, and the majority of my experiences there, to this day. Supporting the growth of similar feelings in GW students was my primary goal in taking on this role in 2003.”
Tapscott said he is thankful for those who have supported and fostered connections to the MSSC through speaker events, alumni programming and social media during his tenure.
“Thank you for the opportunity to serve, I love you GW Multicultural, LGBTQ, and Interfaith Community,” Tapscott said.

WayMap is currently preparing a version of the program that would accommodate passengers using wheelchairs, and developers hope to introduce other app features that could aid deaf and deaf-blind passengers.
A navigation app aiding visually impaired passengers will launch at 30 Metro train stations and 1,000 bus stops by September.
Officials announced at a press conference last week that WayMap, a UK-based system, has partnered with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind – a D.C. nonprofit aiding the District’s blind or visually impaired population – to deliver auditory instructions to blind and low vision commuters like how many steps to take or what degree to turn to reach their destination. Officials said the free app began operating in the Brookland, Silver Spring and Braddock Road stations in late May, and the entire Metro system will operate on the system by early 2023.
“Our goal is to provide our customers with reliable service,” said Christiaan Blake, the managing director of WMATA’s access services at the press conference. “It’s not always easy, but each day we’re making strides towards that goal, and this partnership that you’re hearing about today is another step towards that goal.”
The navigation system’s instructions are accurate up to three feet away from the destination and only require software in participating stations to monitor the movement of commuters. The new app has already seen success in London’s Arriva Rail, and various New York City subway stations are currently trialing the system.
“It made me feel so comfortable, and that was my first time using the metro system since I lost my sight,” Shirell Scott, who lost her sight during the pandemic, told the DCist. “Trying it let me know ‘Oh, I have that independence back. As long as I have this option, I can go and do the Metro and do everything that I did before.’”

Despite the transition to summer classes, there’s still plenty going on at GW and across D.C. Amid administrative shakeups and business arrangements on campus, the Capital Pride parade is a reason to celebrate.
In other news, the defeat of a former GW student’s lawsuit alleging racism and discrimination in the University’s athletic department raises the question of just how seriously the University takes its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.
And all the while, an uptick of COVID-19 cases is a cause for concern for students still in the District and those looking to come back after the summer.
Here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up: 
While changes within the University administration may be the last thing on students’ minds right now, Dean of Students Cissy Petty and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz are preparing to depart the University at the end of the month. Since joining GW in 2018, Petty has established herself as a member of the community by reaching out to students and their families, even moving into District House with her dog, Jazz, last fall. Diaz, who also joined the University in 2018, steered the University’s finances through the COVID-19 pandemic and spearheaded initiatives like U-Pass. But faculty senators criticized Diaz earlier this year for his alleged involvement in a University project that surveilled the movement of students, staff and faculty through their WiFi. And that pandemic-era leadership also resulted in mass layoffs of staff that the University is still recovering from.
While Petty established herself as a familiar face on campus, Diaz’s legacy is a mixed bag of major initiatives that, for better or worse, will shape GW in the years to come. Their departures will give the Board of Trustees an opportunity to outline GW’s future – let’s hope they take it.
Meanwhile, officials are also saying goodbye to The Aston, hiring an outside property firm to help market the off-campus residence hall most recently home to juniors and seniors displaced during renovations to Thurston Hall.
My take? Good riddance – given the poor state of The Aston, I doubt student residents will miss the building’s persistent maintenance issues, like burst pipes and leaking laundry machines, much. The residence hall seems to have been genuinely uninhabitable this year. Selling The Aston should relieve GW of a financial burden, allow it to invest in other residence halls and remove a major housing-related headache for students.
Turning to events outside GW, are you still in D.C. and looking for something to do? Check out Capital Pride, a series of events spanning the month of June offering fun, food and festivities in support of LGBTQ+ equality. D.C.’s Pride Parade will begin at 3 p.m. on Saturday, June 11. The parade route starts at 14th and T Streets and ends in Dupont Circle.
Thumbs Down: 
The District Court of D.C. ultimately ruled in favor of the University after student Jabari Stafford sued the University in 2018, alleging tennis coaches and fellow players discriminated against him. Stafford claims that the University failed to investigate his claims or reprimand his coaches. Those claims include reports of blatantly discriminatory conduct, like his fellow teammates’ alleged use of racial slurs, as well as targeted harassment campaigns that culminated in what Stafford has said was his “unlawful” suspension from the team.
But the court’s ruling isn’t exactly a slam dunk for GW – finding that Stafford’s claims fall outside the statute of limitations dealing with federal anti-discrimination and education law isn’t the same as saying Stafford didn’t suffer racist abuse at the hands of his peers and coaches. In other words, it’s a bad look, and it underscores that GW’s public-facing commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is different from its stance behind closed doors – especially when those doors are in a courtroom. Worse still, it might discourage other students from reporting racist and other discriminatory behavior on campus.
In COVID-19 news, officials announced in an email last week that the University’s mask mandate would remain in place until further notice due to an increased number of COVID-19 cases. Between June 1 and June 7, the University had a 3.65 percent seven-day case positivity rate, or 134 positive tests out of 3,668 total tests. For comparison, the University reinstated its mask mandate after lifting it in April when the case positivity rate reached 2 percent.
It’s worth noting that these positive tests are coming from fewer weekly tests – the University administered around 5,000 tests for that same one-week period in June compared to around 10,000 tests a week during the academic year. A quieter campus as the University transitions to virtual or part-time summer classes could mean that the GW community is contracting COVID-19 elsewhere rather than a more direct form of community spread. Either way, while it’s too early to make a call about a transition to virtual classes this fall, it’s worth keeping an eye on the pandemic and continuing to take steps to protect your health.

The menu includes plenty of options for vegetarians, like the basilico alla genovese pizza, which features toppings like sundried tomato pesto and fresh mint.
Stellina Pizzeria’s hybrid fast-casual sit-down vibe along with its bright and colorful furniture and wall decor sets it apart as the ideal place to enjoy Italian food with a modern twist.
With locations all across the D.C. area including Mount Vernon Triangle, Union Market and Shirlington, Virginia, Stellina Pizzeria is easily accessible for locals across the region, including GW students who can visit the Mount Vernon Triangle location with a Metro ride or a brisk walk from campus. On a weeknight, Stellina Pizzeria is a spot to snag dishes inspired by Italian street food if you’re looking for something a little more upscale given its prices and level of service, while still enjoying a fun and colorful aesthetic.
Modern furniture and floral wall decor that compliment the restaurant’s bright red chairs and barstools were my first sights upon entering the restaurant, giving it a modern vibe that contrasted some of the classic dishes on their menu. Though I happened to stop by on a rainy day, the Mount Vernon location – which opened last month – provided expansive outdoor seating with umbrellas and reliable shade at every table.
Stellina Pizzeria also offers a loaded happy hour experience with a deal to purchase one drink, a 10-inch margherita pizza, house-made chips, arancini – a Sicilian rice ball dish – and mozzarella in carrozza – fried mozzarella sticks – all for $20. Though my friend and I decided on the cacio e pepe pizza, any patron can opt for the happy hour special Tuesdays through Fridays from 3 to 6 p.m.
Stellina Pizzeria also offers a wide array of paninis and pasta dishes ranging from classics like their lasagna to new dishes like the “Stellina ‘fili’ cheese steak,” served at the Union Market location and made with rib eye, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, pickles and roasted peppers on a traditional sub. The menu also includes plenty of options for vegetarians, like the basilico alla genovese pizza, which features mouthwatering toppings like sundried tomato pesto, fresh mint and pistachio.
We started off with the focaccia bread ($4) as an appetizer, which was a much thinner and almost flaky bread than most focaccia I’ve had, but it was still a solid appetizer to get us excited about the meal to come. The bread was crispy and light, and the minced garlic brushed onto the top was a pleasant addition.
The cacio e pepe pizza ($17) – the restaurant’s signature dish made with Cacio di Roma, pecorino Romano, mozzarella and toasted black pepper – was the real star of the show. The fresh cracked pepper on top contrasting with the density of the cheese was enjoyable, and unexpectedly so given the sheer amount of cheese.
The pizza crust was fluffy while still crispy and flavorful, and it effectively complimented the intensity of the cheese and cacio e pepe sauce. The pizza came with six slices, which ended up being enough to satisfy the hunger of two people.
To round out our meal we ordered a piece of tiramisu ($10) off the dessert menu. The dessert came with dark chocolate espresso beans sprinkled on top, which was a gratifying pair with the espresso-soaked ladyfingers and the light mascarpone cream. With a dusting of cocoa powder on top, the bitterness of the dark chocolate balanced well with the sweetness of the cream and left us wishing we had ordered one slice per person.
Stellina Pizzeria is the perfect spot for a vegetarian-friendly meal with a slightly more upscale vibe than its neighboring Sweetgreen, and it manages to use basic ingredients to create largely authentic Italian dishes for a wide audience.

Jacob Orgel is a graduate of the Class of 2022.
My fellow graduates:
I believe one word has defined our educational experience over the past several years more than any other – “unprecedented.”
The word is all over the news. Commentators use it to describe everything from the COVID-19 pandemic that forced us into virtual classrooms for more than a year to the leak of the Supreme Court’s opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which foretells attacks on disenfranchised groups’ legal rights that go well beyond abortion access, even threatening marriage equality and constitutional protection for contraception.
Having spent the past three years as a law student at GW Law in D.C., the Jan. 6 insurrection sticks out as another example of the “unprecedented” nature of our time in school. The attack shuttered the Foggy Bottom Campus for the day and prompted members of the National Guard to patrol University property in the following weeks. The insurrection has cast a dark cloud over our nation as we continue to grapple with its implications for our democracy and the horrid racist and antisemitic slogans the rioters championed.
The evidence is clear that we are living in unprecedented times, and yet, I am profoundly optimistic about our future. I believe the challenges we face instill the insights and provide the opportunities for us to leave the world a better place than we found it.
I get pushback from my friends when I say it, but I consider myself an “American optimist.” I don’t believe in blind optimism. Instead, I believe in a well-founded optimism flowing from the inspiration of my peers and an appreciation for the symbolic weight that my family’s name carries on my law school diploma.
My grandfather was the lone Holocaust survivor in his family. When he arrived in the United States at roughly the same age I am now, he had nothing to his name and no marketable skills. Despite these roadblocks, he found a job and laid the foundation for my family. He took great pride in sending his children, including my mother, to receive an education – a privilege he never had. He believed that in America, his new home, education presented an indispensable opportunity to learn about the world, to engage with a network of individuals with diverse experiences and to receive the toolkit to chart one’s own path in life.
When my mother met my father, who also emerged from an upbringing of little means to become a first-generation college student, they connected in part over their desire to provide a better life for their children. They raised me to embrace education and encouraged me to embark on my own academic journey. Twenty-two years later, while crossing the stage at my law school graduation, I felt a deep appreciation for my ancestors, my parents and the values they passed on to me. In the spirit of their principles, I developed a professional skill set while learning to see the world through the eyes of my peers of different backgrounds and ideological predispositions.
I only shared a few years of life with my grandfather – he passed away when I was three. But just as he was proud to support his children as they went to school and learned to navigate the future, I am now proud to carry forward the baton of his legacy and fight for its modern manifestations.
My grandfather came to America in search of the prophesized “land of opportunity,” but my family has come to understand that America’s true promise – a promise still unrealized, but continuously pursued – is as a land of equal opportunity. This proposition entails combatting the ignorance and bigotry underpinning the injustices perpetrated against my ancestors and breaking down the barriers to access to the American Dream from which my family benefitted.
As I have gone through my educational experience, I have been taken by the number of my classmates that share these values. Statistically speaking, my generation is more accepting than any to come before it on a variety of issues including countless forms of diversity and marriage equality.
Forged in the fire of this unprecedented, tumultuous era, young people have developed the fortitude to fight for progress. My generation has led the charge behind the ongoing movement for racial equity. We helped orchestrate the Women’s March, which became an annual call for gender equality in cities across the country after it began in 2017. We turned out to vote in record numbers in the 2020 election to support candidates who promised to fight for our values in Congress and the White House. There is a resounding consensus across my generation, a common thread fueling these movements – we demand a better America, an America that delivers on its promise of equal opportunity, inclusivity and fundamental human decency for all.
Looking around at my graduation ceremony, the diversity which my graduating class represented inspired me. I saw a group of now-lawyers graduating from a university whose namesake never imagined many of its members would be present in his country – a group that will now lead that country into its next chapter.
As the Class of 2022, we enter a world in unprecedented disrepair. But in these unprecedented times, I have the utmost confidence that we will rise to the stakes of the moment, join together in fighting for the realization of the American dream and ourselves become unprecedented as a force for positive change.

In the span of three days, 17 people died and 62 people were injured in a string of nationwide shootings last weekend. Less than two weeks earlier, 21 people were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas – the deadliest school shooting in the United States since 2012. As the cycle of loss, mourning and anger plays out in Buffalo, New York, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Philadelphia and Uvalde, actual legislative action on Capitol Hill has been slow to manifest. While the U.S. House of Representatives passed a wide-ranging gun control bill on Wednesday, it has almost no chance of passing a Senate engaged in its own slow-going and tense negotiations. Yet as Congress attempts to address the factors underlying these shootings, our representatives need to understand that mass shootings exist in a larger system of gun violence that slips through the cracks of media coverage and political concern.
As of Friday night, 255 mass shootings in which four or more people, excluding the shooter, were injured have occurred in the United States in 2022. That statistic can change somewhat depending on how one defines mass shootings, but the point stands – Americans are dealing with an epidemic of gun violence that the economic and social turbulence of the COVID-19 pandemic only accelerated. But if gun violence has worsened over the last two years, why did it take Congress until now to act? Why did it take two mass shootings at a Buffalo grocery store and at a Uvalde elementary school to finally force the government’s hand? If tragic mass shootings can barely overcome the political inertia required to make real change, then far less deadly but far more frequent shootings are practically off politicians’ radar. If our leaders are serious about addressing gun violence, they need to address it in all of its forms.
Based on a rather literal definition of “gun violence” as the use of a firearm to commit a violent act, accidental discharges and stray bullets, individual homicides and suicides, armed robbery and domestic abuse are all forms of gun violence. The key truth to understand is that gun violence goes beyond mass shootings, and individual instances of gun violence are not always equally lethal or lethal at all. At first, that definition of gun violence seems broad – perhaps too broad, even. But that’s the point. Gun violence is a broad category because there are so many ways in which guns enable and sustain harm – even if they don’t cause a fatal injury.
Gun violence doesn’t always manifest as mass murder, and that fact often invites attempts to downplay shootings and gun violence that involve one or no victims at all, especially when these shootings occur in or near schools. This temptation to dismiss such instances of gun violence based on the number or lack of victims alone is logically and morally repugnant – it implies that these people aren’t victims, that they haven’t suffered a terrible ordeal even if they emerged alive.
A mass shooting and a stray bullet soaring through the front door are both instances of gun violence. I’m not going to pretend that these examples are the same, but to minimize or outright ignore the latter because no one died is utterly cruel – it makes the victims and survivors of gun violence, and their families, invisible. When the survivors and families of the victims of the Buffalo and Uvalde shootings testified before Congress earlier this week, how many other Americans, including D.C. residents, needed Congress to hear their voices and listen to their stories?
Because if Congress is finally coming around to the idea that mass shootings are bad, just wait for them to address gun violence writ large. I mean that literally – wait, and keep waiting. “We don’t have to end the epidemic of gun violence with one piece of legislation,” Senator Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who is working to shepherd legislation through the U.S. Senate, has said. I don’t want to pillory Murphy, who understands as much as anyone that Congressional action is long overdue. But his statement in the spirit of compromise highlights the abhorrent “mustn’t-be-too-hasty” attitude underlying these negotiations and perhaps a continued desire among some politicians to continue to do nothing at all.
What scares me most is the feeling that that’s precisely what’s going to happen – nothing. The only reason these negotiations are continuing is because the cycle of loss, mourning and anger hasn’t yet arrived at the point when some other news event subsumes gun violence. And I truly hope that I am wrong. Because the idea that more people, whether grandparents or school children, teachers or doctors, cashiers or security guards, are going to die for nothing is equally heart-wrenching and infuriating.
The unfortunate truth is that, albeit to vastly different degrees, every American faces the threat of gun violence. And until our leaders act, the names of their towns and cities, schools and neighborhoods, houses of worship and even hospitals will become hashtags and headlines announcing life and death, tragedy and resolve. How many other places will America come to learn, not for those who lived there, but those who died there? And how many will we never hear about at all?

The appeal alleges non-white players faced years of racism, from frequent racist slurs, harassment and harsher punishment from coaches for minor infractions. 
A former men’s tennis player appealed a January ruling last Friday that dismissed a lawsuit alleging players and coaches used racial slurs, discriminated against him and “unlawfully” suspended him from the team.
Jabari Stafford filed the appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals after the 2018 lawsuit, which accuses officials of failing to properly address a racist and discriminatory environment fostered by players and coaches during Stafford’s time as a player, was dismissed earlier this year. Christopher Cooper, a D.C. District Court judge, ruled against Stafford in January, citing the expiration of a one-year statute of limitations for discrimination claims based on the D.C. Human Rights Act, but Stafford’s appeal argues that a three-year statute of limitations based on D.C.’s personal injury law should apply in this case.
The appeal – like the lawsuit before it – alleges Stafford and other non-white players faced years of racism, from frequent racist slurs, harassment and harsher punishment from coaches for minor infractions. The appeal states GW coaches participated in discriminatory acts with racist comments, and that staff members and administrators allegedly failed to properly investigate and address them.
“The University took no action to end the discrimination,” the appeal alleges. “Indeed, at least three of the school officials Stafford spoke to actively discouraged him from reporting the abuse.”
Stafford sued the University, athletics department officials and 10 former members of the men’s tennis team in November 2018, alleging they racially discriminated against him by tolerating and participating in racist behavior and jokes. The appeal states officials failed to address the regular use of the n-word and other slurs against Stafford, and declined to investigate Stafford’s claims after he complained about the incidents to officials.
“They asked him if his ancestors were slaves, how he could be Black and have money and told him he belonged in Black neighborhoods,” the appeal reads. “They plotted to goad him into lashing out so that they could secretly record him and then use the recording to have him kicked off the team.”
The appeal also alleges that teammates sexually harassed and assaulted another player, who is a person of color, on the team on multiple occasions.
Cooper, the D.C. District Court judge, said in his judgement that with a longer statute of limitations – which limits the time that a lawsuit can be filed after an event – the court would have allowed the jury to consider Stafford’s claims about the effect of discrimination on his education and officials’ alleged “deliberate indifference” to his experience. Cooper’s judgement states GW doesn’t challenge Stafford’s claims that he faced “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive” abuse while on the tennis team, a choice that he calls “wise.”
“Stafford has now substantiated his allegations, through his own testimony and that of at least one fellow teammate, that the use of racial epithets, directed at or used around him, was prevalent throughout periods of his tenure at GWU,” the judgement states.
In an interview with The Hatchet, Tom Stafford – Jabari’s father – said he was “very confident” in their ability to win the appeal.
Stafford removed former tennis head coaches Greg Munoz and David Macpherson, former athletic director Patrick Nero and former assistant athletic director Nicole Early from the case in September 2019 after the judge dismissed several charges against those defendants. The judge allowed the case to continue with GW as the sole defendant.
The University denied claims that officials mistreated Stafford based on “the color of his skin” in a 2019 filing, which stated officials treated him “fairly and lawfully.” University spokesperson Tim Pierce declined to comment on Stafford’s appeal.
The appeal’s docket includes thousands of pages of depositions, documents, emails, texts and social media posts revealing a pervasive culture of racism, harassment, bullying and discrimination among members of the men’s tennis team during Stafford’s time as a player from 2014 to 2017.
Most documents were obtained during the lawsuit’s litigation and made public over the course of the last several years since the original filing. Some vital depositions from key figures in these incidents – including staff members who responded to claims of discrimination and former tennis players who allegedly faced discrimination – remain sealed, making them unavailable for public viewing.
The appeal claims former head coach Greg Munoz “chastised” Stafford and minimized his concerns when Stafford told Chris Reynolds, who was then serving as co-captain of the team, that Reynolds couldn’t use the n-word. The appeal also claims Munoz threatened to kick Stafford off the team during his freshman year if he filed a formal complaint about the team’s environment.
The complaint states Munoz temporarily suspended Stafford from the team in January 2015 for “anger control,” “profanity issues” and problems related to team morale after Stafford confronted Reynolds who had allegedly called Stafford the n-word, according to the appeal.
The appeal goes on to state that Munoz described Stafford as a “token Black kid” during Stafford’s sophomore season but refused to acknowledge there was racism on the team.
Munoz, who resigned for “personal reasons” in February 2016, did not return a request for comment. In 2018, Munoz told The Hatchet that the original lawsuit includes “far-fetched” allegations and “made-up stories and exaggerations.”
In one Facebook post from Stafford’s freshman year, Francisco Dias – a tennis player who was captain of the team during Stafford’s freshman season – posted a meme of SpongeBob in blackface which also included the n-word, according to a screenshot of the meme published in court documents. Dias did not immediately return a request for comment.
In another court document, Stafford accused Dennis Afanasev, a former tennis player who graduated in 2020, of calling Black opponents “monkeys” while losing. Wills Tutecky, a former tennis player, told the athletics department in 2018 that teammates seemed to be “fearful” to address Afanasev’s behavior due to concerns of retribution from Afanasev’s father, a physics professor at the University, according to a statement he sent to GW’s Title IX director.
Afanasev and Tutecky did not return a request for comment.
Stafford also accused four teammates of trying to coerce other players into secretly recording and “goading” Stafford into saying something negative about the team in an effort to get him kicked off during the 2017-2018 season. Tutecky also said Reynolds tried to “force” him to secretly record Stafford, according to an email published in court documents.
Reynolds did not immediately return a request for comment.
The appeal states that Stafford and his father told Ed Scott, the former senior associate director of athletics, and Helen Cannaday Saulny, the former associate provost for diversity, equity and community engagement, about the racist incidents at the beginning of Stafford’s junior year in 2016. But despite responding with “mortification,” the appeal criticizes them for failing to open an investigation into the incidents, instead directing Stafford to GW’s grievance filing website.
In a 2020 deposition, Director of Students Rights and Responsibilities Christy Anthony said students should use student grievance procedures when reporting incidents, and that staff members should direct students to those protocols when necessary.
Saulny, who now serves as GW’s director of community engagement and D.C. partnerships, could not be reached through a spokesperson. Scott, who now serves as the deputy athletics director at the University of Virginia, did not return a request for comment.
In emails published in court documents, Tutecky said he told Macpherson, the then-Head Coach, about bullying he faced from Reynolds, the team’s co-captain during the 2017-2018 season, multiple times from fall 2016 to fall 2017 but the coach did not address the culture of “exclusion, favorites and intimidation, racism and raunchy language.”
Macpherson, now the coach of professional tennis player John Isner, did not return a request for comment.
In an email sent to Tutecky in April of 2018, Athletic Director Tanya Vogel said an outside law firm, Potomac Law Group, would conduct an investigation into the men’s tennis team, “closely” involved with the Title IX Office. Vogel did not specify the reason for the investigation in her email.
Macpherson resigned months later in August of 2018, citing a desire to focus solely on training professional tennis players.
University spokesperson Tim Pierce declined to comment on the 2018 investigation of the men’s tennis team.
“GW does not deny that the abuse took place,” the appeal states. “But it has not taken the opportunity for self-examination or reform. It has not accepted any responsibility. It has not apologized.”

The D.C. Council unanimously approved legislation banning employers from firing employees for off-the-clock cannabis use.
District lawmakers unanimously passed a bill Tuesday that would stop employers from firing employees who test positive for cannabis use.
If the legislation is approved by Mayor Muriel Bowser, District employers would be barred from either firing or refusing to hire employees because of their recreational or medical cannabis use. The bill, however, makes an exception for employees who have “safety-sensitive jobs” like those who operate heavy machinery, healthcare workers and police officers.
Employees could also still face disciplinary action if they are caught using, selling or growing cannabis at work. The bill also doesn’t protect federal employees because of the drug’s prohibition at the federal level.
D.C. legalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana in 2015, but a report published in March from the Committee on Labor and Workforce Development found most workers in the District were unable to freely use cannabis because of strict drug policies at employers.
“Even though cannabis is legal, workers can be fired or disciplined for using it in their personal time and without any impact on their work,” the report states.
