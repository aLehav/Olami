Welcome Week will tip the balance from a typically entertainment-oriented event lineup toward hitting the books, reflecting the University’s intensifying desire to become a more academically minded institution.
The subtle twist in programming for students’ first week back on campus comes after GW’s highest academic leader, Provost Steven Lerman, also became head of student life operations last spring.
“I had a sense that perhaps the pendulum had swung a little too far on the, ‘Let’s all get excited and think of this as a great entertainment opportunity,’” Lerman said.
Academic programs – including a workshop on surviving the college workload, four events revolving around summer reading, a sustainability open house and a professor series called Last Lecture – have all made their way onto the Welcome Week calendar. The author of this summer’s freshman book, “War,” will speak Sept. 5, squeezed between annual events like Target Takeover, a hypnotist show, movie screenings and Fall Fest.
Lerman said the more balanced schedule falls in line with the plan to prioritize intellectualism.
When Lerman was hired away from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2010, University President Steven Knapp said he would take the lead in meshing academics with student life.
“It’s a part of a much larger picture,” Lerman said. “Of course, just telling more people about it doesn’t in and of itself improve the quality of education. You actually have to improve the quality of education and research, and that’s really where the big investments are.”
“We haven’t radically transformed [Welcome Week], but I think we are trying to,” Lerman said.
Under former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, GW appealed to students by building up the student life experience with bigger and better residence halls, splashy campus-wide programs like Colonial Inauguration and a Welcome Week full of freebies.
It worked. Applications rose 35 percent from 2001 to 2011.
Before student life offices began answering to the provost this spring, they reported to Robert Chernak – the former senior vice provost and senior vice president for Student and Academic Support Services – who alongside Trachtenberg helped quash GW’s reputation as a commuter school.
In his 24 years at GW, Chernak became the institution’s face of student life – until he retired in June.
“He was brought in to build an undergraduate population and an undergraduate community, and now that that’s here, that’s thriving,” an employee who has served under both administrations said, on the condition of anonymity to speak more candidly about internal discussions.
When Trachtenberg bowed out in 2007, the University ushered in an era of academics with the inauguration of Knapp, a literary scholar who was the provost at Johns Hopkins University.
Since Lerman, MIT’s former vice chancellor and dean for graduate education, arrived in Foggy Bottom two years ago, the University has pushed forward mammoth academic projects like the $275 million Science and Engineering Hall, a $16 million Gelman Library renovation and a $14 million investment in academic programs in the GW School of Business and the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.
With Chernak’s departure this summer, the provost called together the offices now in his realm to lay out a vision for melding student and academic programs.
“He came in, took his jacket off, rolled his sleeves…and said, ‘This is where we’re going,’” the employee said, adding that talks of strengthening academics have been the buzz among leaders on the lower rungs of GW as well – all looking to “change a culture” under the school’s new leadership.
As administrators gear up for the release of a strategic plan in October, outlining 10 years of academic and research goals, Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski said more academic programming is a “natural progression” toward becoming a top-tier school.
“We’re trying to make Welcome Week a little less social – a little more academic in nature,” he said. “We’re trying to further solidify Lerman’s vision of integration between the student experience and academics.”
He said freshmen seem increasingly eager to jump right into classes and campus events that offer a chance for “intellectual discourse.”
“Students come here with real passion for issues,” he added. “It’s an important thing for us to be talking about.”
The provost’s office has also influenced programming at the Center for Student Engagement on a macro level.
Associate Dean of Students Tim Miller said the one-year-old office also has made its several dozen faculty in-residence members a greater part of students’ living experiences. It launched in 1998, and Lerman – who lived in residence halls at MIT – has expanded it considerably since his arrival. About 14 professors live in dorms on the Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses.
“We’re all aware that we’re in the vision within the provost’s team,” Miller said, adding that he is supportive. “All along, we’ve liked making the connections.”

The Center for Student Engagement is asking its staff to make every penny count and cut unneeded expenses.
Tim Miller, who leads the newly created student life office, told house staff and community directors to ditch informal weekly gatherings that use cookie dough or Domino’s pizza to lure students out of their rooms.
“[A house staff member’s] weekly thing can’t just be making a dozen cookies for their residents,” Miller said. “It’s not a worthwhile expenditure.”
Instead, Miller said he wants to see larger scale, less frequent events that bring together several floors and start conversations about dealing with stress, finding internships or studying abroad, a desire that reflects a University-wide effort to better support students’ transitions in college.
House staff members – CSE’s hands on the ground in residence halls – are required to spend about 10 hours a week in their buildings with students, time that Miller said sometimes includes using baked goods or pizza to create conversations.
Miller said the office will continue the same funding for house staff’s programming budgets – the total of which CSE does not disclose.
One house staff member, speaking under the condition of anonymity because house staffers are not authorized to speak to the media, said students will continue to expect free food from their house staff members, who might in turn feel compelled to buy snacks with their own cash.
The student expressed concern that house staff could not pull off events without being able to attract students with free food.
“Unfortunately, not everyone will go out and buy cookie dough. I know I won’t have pocket money all the time, but I will do what I can,” the staffer said.
The live-in student leaders have full reins on planning events using their annual programming budget, and Miller said his team cannot feasibly check each and every staff purchase.
And Miller said he agreed there are certain times, like during the beginning of the year, when it is more difficult to grab students’ attention, and sometimes offering free food can be a draw-in for cash-strapped students.
“I’m happy to spend money if it’s going to be good for the students,” Miller said. “We will never base a decision solely on money – it will always be about the philosophy of what we’re trying to do and the purpose of what we’re trying to accomplish.”
Acknowledging that house staff will face a challenge planning events without giving away food, Miller said he is intentionally giving them “a broad directive with no specifics of what to do and what not to do” so they can be more creative and cater to their students’ needs.
He added that CSE would also scrap “event quotas,” which had been in place in some halls requiring house staff to host one or two events each week. Miller said the policy too often led to “three-person events on three different floors at the same time in Thurston that each cost $30 or $40.”
Each month, the center’s staffers, who focus on students according to class years, will cater programming based on specific areas: transitions, personal development, community building, residential experience, co-curricular engagement and leadership development.
Teams for upperclassmen, for example, have planned events that take on personal development through MCAT, LSAT and GRE test prep workshops and a life skills series on buying insurance, taking out and paying off student loans, renting or owning houses and preparing for retirement.
For the remaining 30 percent of programs, the office will rely on house staff as its eyes and ears to identify where students need guidance.

A metal placard will hang on the fourth floor of the 1959 E St. residence hall this year, with a message for visitors of the aspiring entrepreneurs living there: “You’re all going to be working for us one day.”
Twenty-two students moved into the University’s first living community for entrepreneurs this weekend, unpacking boxes to live with peers who will help them formulate business ideas.
They will spend the year in entrepreneurial boot camp, perfecting pitch techniques and mingling with local startup managers and venture capitalists to make their floor a social scene and a business classroom.
“One thing we’re trying to push really hard is building a community of people who trust each other and can tell each other whether an idea is receptive,” said Trever Faden, an information systems technology major who created the affinity housing group. “That honesty determines whether it’s a feasible idea and creates business.”
The University is adding offerings for entrepreneurs at a time when top schools funnel millions of dollars into student startups. But the affinity housing group, alongside other initiatives, could kindle the culture of entrepreneurship at GW, Director of the Office of Entrepreneurship Jim Chung said.
And through floor parties and brainstorming sessions, the group hopes to create a sounding board to shape their own startups.
Faden already runs his own business, a cost-saving startup called Dogfish Labs that works with companies, like the analytics group Callahan & Associates, to cut excess spending. He said he gains insight from D.C.’s burgeoning entrepreneurship scene, but added that his classmates often “don’t know about the opportunities available outside the school.”
“We have the ability to force students to work together and create things that they wouldn’t be able to do if they just met once at a student organization,” Faden said. He called the entrepreneurs who started companies like Amazon, Facebook and LivingSocial “pop icons,” inspiring a new wave of entrepreneurs inspired by business successes and “The Social Network.”
When Faden pitched the entrepreneurship affinity housing option to GW Housing Programs, he didn’t think it would make the cut. But an email blast advertising it to business and engineering students drew interest from 50 students.
The flood of inquiries shows that more and more students are looking to develop business acumens, Chung said.
The two-year-old Office of Entrepreneurship runs programming like the annual business plan competition, which saw its most entries ever last year, and a “venture pub” – a series of networking sessions that will launch this fall to link students and alumni at local restaurants.
While the affinity housing project grew as strictly a student initiative, Chung said the office would lend a hand to help students get business ideas off the ground.
“Starting a company is a very tough thing to do, and having that support network and having that kind of environment is absolutely critical,” Chung said. “What we’re trying to do is build a safe and friendly environment for the exploration of entrepreneurship as a viable career alternative for the students. The affinity housing is a part of that.”
He added that the diversity of student interests, from science to engineering to business, will fuse in 1959 E St. to help students collaborate like those at research and entrepreneurship powerhouses like Stanford, University of Michigan and University of Maryland, which have dedicated entire residence halls and degree programs to entrepreneurs.
The group is split between males and females and includes one-third engineers and two-thirds business students.
Affinity housing has helped former residents at University of Wisconsin-Madison create products ranging from skateboard accessories to medical devices since it began in 2008, John Surdyk, associate director of its entrepreneurship program.
“In many ways, it’s like a launching point with these students,” he said. “They’re playing with these concepts and building their professional networks, but it may be a few years before they go further.”
Faden said the living community at GW will look to cultivate that launching point and inspire students to grit through business failure.
“There’s never going to be a class at the University about how to be a hustler. You have to know how to get things done,” he said.

After years of active duty, some former soldiers are confronting the challenges of an entirely different ground: college.
The number of veterans under the Post 9/11 GI Bill, which helps returning soldiers pay tuition, is expected to cross the 1,000 mark this fall, president of GW Veterans Tommy Davis said.
In 2008, the number of students at GW under the bill was 350. Last year, that number surged to 950.
“GW Vets has increased its programming to make sure that not only does each veteran or dependent receive as much information about GW as possible, but that the GW community also becomes aware of the large amount of vets and military brats on campus this year,” Garrett Hoppin, the group’s outreach coordinator, said.
As the student veteran population grows, GW Veterans plans to expand its presence and form ties within the District, including those with non-military organizations, by incorporating activities ranging from planting trees to participating in races.
For the upcoming school year, Davis created executive board positions specifically for service and outreach.
GW became a participant in the Post 9/11 GI Bill in 2008. A year later, the University embraced the Yellow Ribbon Program, offering substantial financial support to matriculating military veterans who served in active duty for at least a year and a half after Sept. 11, 2001. For private institutions, including GW, funding caps at $18,770.
“We’re trying to focus more on showing the public the effects that veterans can have in community service projects,” Hodge said.
“We want to be able to give back to the University – to contribute our life experiences, our work ethic and our leadership ability, and give that back,” Davis added.
To foster relationships between student veterans and their campus peers, Davis said he is advocating for military affinity housing, an option which he hopes can ease the transition to college for veterans who are eager for a taste of dorm life.
“As a freshman, let’s say in Thurston Hall, everybody’s friends with everybody. Everyone’s door is open. [As] veterans, we never had that experience,” Robert Hodge, a graduate representative for GW Veterans, said. “[GW Vets] helps [veterans] break into the social scene and realize that someone is here for them.”
Expanding volunteer service efforts benefits not only GW and local communities, but the veterans themselves, Davis said. As former military lieutenants and sergeants assimilate into campus life as ordinary students, many face challenges of integration.
“Most [veterans] come as transfer students. They don’t know anybody. That’s how people drop out, and they don’t become stationary,” Davis said. “[It’s difficult] to come back and be a regular person again, especially when you come to a university where you’re surrounded by teenagers and kids in their early 20s. It’s hard to find common ground.”
Davis hopes to solidify relationships between veterans and fellow pupils by increasing student outreach, even spearheading a veterans-focused orientation this September. The forum will feature an organization fair to introduce veterans to on-campus groups as they forge relationships beyond the military sphere.
The University is ranked No. 16 on Military Times EDGE magazine’s list of military-friendly universities.
“I don’t think any school can call themselves military friendly without participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program,” Davis said. “I think GW has the capability to lead in terms of their support for veterans.”

Don’t want to spend time shopping around and taking in the ambiance at these liquor stores? The Bar Bro’s got you covered with his list of the cheapest options for every class of drinker.
The frat star: Buy a 30-rack of Natural Light at Columbia Plaza. At $12.99, it’s the cheapest on campus.
The (sketchy) frat star: Jungle Juice is a one-stop shopping experience at Columbia Plaza, with a handle of Everclear ($31.99) and a number of mixers – 64-ounce fruit punch and orange juice ($3.99 each) and two-liter Sprite ($2.64).
The Biddie: Columbia Plaza also has the cheapest bottom-shelf vodka. Pick your poison with Zelco or Velicoff (both $12.99).
The Mix-and-matcher: Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe’s offer a selection of single beers (ranging from $1.49 to $2.99). Pay a la carte and assemble your perfect six-pack.
The Oenophile: Three Wishes is $3 at Whole Foods Market. The Merlot is the tastiest.
The Bum Wine-o-phile: I can’t stress the virtues of Mad Dog enough. Go to Columbia Plaza.
The Keg Stander: If you absolutely must, Riverside Liquors is the only store that sells kegs – for a wallet-denting $70.
The Mini Keg-Stander: For the diminutive kegger, FoBoGro sells a five-liter keg of Rogue Yellow Snow beer for $29.99.
The Allergic: Whole Foods Market offers a comprehensive gluten-free section that includes hard ciders like Jack’s ($8.99 for a six pack) and gluten-free beers like Omission ($9.99 for a six pack).
The Thurstonite: 20th and I might be nearby, but there is no other reason to go there. Walk the extra blocks, save some money and burn off some of that freshman 15.
At one point or another, you get that feeling in the pit of your stomach.
You get dressed up, do a few shots at the pregame, find out where everyone’s going and you think to yourself: I can’t afford to drink with these people.
We all know that girl who exclusively buys Grey Goose Vodka, or that kid who banks on bottle service at the club. And they’re fun to party with.
But if you’re like me, you wake up the next morning with a hangover – and an empty wallet.
I’m here to help.
You’re not always going to be able to drag your friends to, say, a grimy pool hall in Columbia Heights. In these cases, a pregame becomes crucial.
A successful – and by that, I mean cheap, yet effective – pregame depends largely on your liquor store shopping habits. Luckily, I’ve done your homework for you.
Below is the Bar Bro’s guide to Foggy Bottom liquor stores and their most cost-effective products.
I urge you to drink responsibly. And remember, don’t be classless – just low class.
506 23rd St. 
The lowdown: The Market at Columbia Plaza is the most popular student spot due to its extensive collection of wine and spirits and its proximity to upperclassman dorms. It offers a full spectrum of cheap beer, from your typical fraternity fare – its 30-racks of Keystone and Natty are the cheapest on campus – to local delicacy Natty Boh.
For the truly degenerate: Columbia Plaza is the only liquor store on campus that offers MD 20/20. Affectionately dubbed “Mad Dog” by devotees, this fortified wine packs a serious wallop. Forget Four Loko – one bottle of Mad Dog will have you set for the night at just over $4. Try the “Orange Jubilee” flavor, reminiscent of Tang that was left out in the sun for about a week. Serve cold.
1926 I St. 
The lowdown: Officially called Pan Mar Liquor, this liquor store remains the go-to for those living on the eastern side of campus. For those of you who haven’t been there in a few years: It’s gotten nicer on the inside, and the staff is still as friendly as ever.
For the true degenerate: Nothing here is particularly cheap. A bottle of Odesse Vodka is reasonable at $13.99, and the selection of high school-favorite Burnett’s is offered at an impressive $14.99 a bottle. For the truly brave, a bottle of Everclear is $15.99. Combined with powdered Gatorade, it should make enough “Everlade” to satisfy an entire party.
2123 E St.
The lowdown: With its red neon signs and its location next to the 24-hour CVS, Riverside Liquors certainly looks like the seediest liquor store on campus. But don’t let that fool you – this is a classy joint. The staff is knowledgeable about the store’s selection of fine wines, and as I learned, many visitors pay their fine wine prices. However, I cannot be seen at a store that charges $70 for a keg of Keystone Light.
For the true degenerate: No Foggy Bottom liquor vendor sells 40s. It has been one of the great tragedies of my collegiate drinking career. Riverside has the next closest thing. Pick up a two-pack of 24-ounce bottles of Icehouse beer ($4).
2140 F St. & 2221 I St. 
The lowdown: It’s no secret that the grocery stores on campus are offensively expensive, but that doesn’t mean they don’t serve their purpose if you’re willing to shell out. They are the only places where you can buy beer or wine on Sunday – an important distinction for those of us planning to enjoy the upcoming football season.
Plus, FoBoGro is the only source of booze on campus past 10 p.m. – it’s open until midnight. Bring cash or credit though – you can’t buy alcohol using your GWorld.
For the true degenerate: Skip FoBoGro’s “5 Buck Tizzy,” and opt for a bottle of Three Wishes at Whole Foods. Not only is Three Wishes offered in a greater variety of grapes, but it is also $2 cheaper and doesn’t taste like Manischewitz mixed with Kool Aid.

The University spent two years fine-tuning its logo in a rebranding campaign that culminated Sunday evening with an unveiling ceremony in the Marvin Center.
A brand – especially a logo – must be strong enough to serve as an institution’s singular identity. A rebranding campaign is not an everyday undertaking. The last time GW touched its visual identity was in 2002. A logo must withstand time and represent a school with diverse interests and people.
The logo released Sunday quite frankly was not a reflection of a university looking to move up in the world of higher education and level itself with prestigious institutions.
It is disappointing that the new logo and rebranding effort, led by two high-profile marketing companies, sacrifices sophistication and ultimately looks cheap.
We were looking for a logo to represent an institution trying to vault up in research rankings.
We were looking for a logo that could appeal to a diverse student body.
We were hoping for a logo that would look collegiate and professional.
And this new logo does not do any of that. It may have a more modern feel, but it does not exude professionalism.
Stylistically, the biggest change to the logo is its font, which now looks especially informal.
The University’s intention was to make the logo more tech-friendly. The new George Washington, a digital recreation of the bust in University Yard, is clean, eye-catching and easily viewable from a computer screen – but its casual tone is out of place at an institution with aspirations of fostering a higher level of academic rigor.
A logo is not going to boost the perceived prestige of the University in the same way that increased undergraduate research and new facilities can.
This new image is not the logo of a university that hopes to align itself with the Ivy League schools, but rather, the logo of an institution that is struggling to distinguish itself among a crowded pool of other universities.
Campus is changing internally and externally. GW is spending millions on the construction of a new Science and Engineering Hall to strengthen academics, encouraging undergraduates across the University to conduct research, developing study abroad programs across the globe and tapping into alumni resources to help bolster its endowment.
Several other schools, like Michigan State University and Miami University of Ohio, hired 160over90 – the same branding agency that GW brought on to join FutureBrand, the company that managed marketing for the London 2012 Olympics. MSU paid $478,000 for its rebranding campaign, according to its student newspaper, The State News.
GW, though, has repeatedly declined to comment on the price tag of its rebranding campaign.
Yes, the University is a private institution, and it is not required to disclose such information.
But students have the right to know how tuition dollars invested in this institution are spent, especially on a two-year effort that failed to impress.

Until I arrived at GW, I hardly paid attention to politics at all. I was always far more concerned with boys.
Four years ago, I tried. But at was 17, I couldn’t vote and thought John McCain looked strikingly similar to Franklin the Turtle’s grandfather. With three years in D.C. to my name and several bizarre dates with political freaks, I’ve realized there is actually much to be learned from politics when it comes to relationships.
In politics, check-writing – unlike volunteering or canvassing – is probably the easiest way to demonstrate your support for a candidate, aside from voting. Opensecrets.org reported that more than $5.8 billion have been thrown into candidates’ pockets for the 2012 election.
And while this passive strategy might help a campaign, it doesn’t work in real relationships. And for those who passively pursue a relationship as though it were a check they could send in the mail, they’ll come to find that any chances of love or happiness fizzle easily.
This election season has also been extremely negative, and it’s difficult to recall what candidates stand for in the first place.
But by focusing on the petty negatives, you miss what’s important. This thought translates just as easily into relationships.
Try not to dwell on the fact that the person you are seeing mispronounces the word “bagel” or that his second toe is longer than his big one. Small quirks should not get in the way of something that has potential.
As voters and as people, we’ve grown accustomed to sound bites, assumptions and generalizations. Whether you’re trying to familiarize yourself with a candidate’s budget plan or getting used to the fact that your new boyfriend is a morning person, any relationship is about learning to better understand another individual.
It takes time and patience, but if you’re willing to put in the effort, you will learn things about the other person – and yourself – that you would not otherwise.
Moreover, the best lesson that can be extracted from politics is the importance of acknowledging the other side.
Just because someone wears the same label as you – or is from the same political party – does not mean they’re going to make you happy. Try breaking away from your dating type.
Relationships and elections alike will be more fulfilling if you consider what’s actually important before casting your ballot.

More than a year and $10 million later, three restaurants along the Georgetown waterfront that were battered by a 10-foot wall of water are ready to reopen.
After replacing everything from walls and floors to kitchen equipment, the owners of Tony and Joe’s Seafood Place, Nick’s Riverside Grille and Farmers Fishers Bakers said they will welcome back customers in the coming weeks.
The three businesses are the last to reopen after the flooding.
Farmers Fishers Bakers, formerly Farmers and Fishers, rebuilt from the ground up after the flood, creating a whole new restaurant through its $4.5 million redesign. The 340-seat venue will feature a redesigned outdoor patio and a new bar, said Jennifer Loy, director of marketing and public relations for The Farm, the restaurant’s parent company, which also owns the Founding Farmers restaurant at 19th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.
The restaurant will open in late October, Loy said.
“After the flood, they demolished the entire space,” Loy said. Everything in the restaurant started over from scratch, she said.
While Tony and Joe’s Seafood Place and Nick’s Riverside Grille have served food from their outdoor patios and grills for months, neither has served patrons indoors since before the flood. Both restaurants, which underwent a total of $5 million in renovations, will reopen Sept. 1.
The Georgetown waterfront flooding was one of several incidents around the District last year caused by the soggy spring. The city’s response to the flooding drew criticism when locals learned the waterfront’s floodwall – typically raised after concerns of heavy rain in the District – was not put into place until hours after the first floods were reported near Georgetown.
The Potomac spilled over at other waterfronts, like the Tidal Basin, East Potomac Park and Hains Point, days before.
Five businesses along the harbor shuttered immediately after the flood. Since then, MRP Realty invested $20 million in a redesign to bring shoppers back to the area. The company has planned a new fountain that will transform into a 12,000 square foot ice skating rink – the largest in the District – slated to open Dec. 1.
Owner Nicholas Cibel said he served food from both restaurants’ patios to keep customers’ interest, though at a “considerable loss” for his businesses. He kept on just 40 of his 150 employees to run the patio dining, and says it was worth it.
“We have been taking care of people that mean a lot to us,” Cibel said. “You can’t measure everything in dollars, I suppose.”
Cibel, who operates both restaurants with his father and cousin, said they were each designed with more modern looks. Tony and Joe’s embodies the ambiance of a cruise ship, he said, while Nick’s will feature a new concrete bar and sound system to create a more “vibrant atmosphere.”
He also hired a new executive chef, David Stein, to add more international flavors to both menus, like chicken curry and Korean-style beef ribs.
Nick’s is also growing in size as it acquires space from the former Mexican restaurant Cabanas, said Julie Chase, a spokeswoman for MRP Realty – the company that owns the waterfront property.
The company has not yet made a decision on what restaurant will occupy the remaining Cabanas space, Chase said.
The spokeswoman said she could not comment on revenue shortfalls for the businesses. The Hatchet reported in April, one year after the flood, that Farmers and Fishers lost between $6 million and $7 million in sales and suffered hundreds of thousands of dollars more in damages.
Greg Casten – the co-owner of Nick’s and Tony and Joe’s – said he could not quantify the financial losses of the two restaurants.

While I do appreciate the kind words spoken about me by Justin Peligri in his column, “The dull reality of Foggy Bottom politics” (Aug. 23, p. 4), I must say I’m disappointed that they take the tone of condolences.
Peligri correctly notes that the student population is generally as interested in politics as they are detached from the politics of their own neighborhood. I find that to be a disappointment and something worth challenging, as opposed to a reality we must be consigned to.
Far from only dealing with mundane quality-of-life issues, the ANC deals with a lot of topics that affect students – albeit often more indirectly than those that come before the Student Association. That the ANC, as Peligri notes, “simply doesn’t represent their needs” is not a function of the body being incapable of doing so, but rather a natural outcome of a body that currently has no student representation.
The campus that we all interact with today has been shaped most directly – for better or worse – by the interplay between the ANC and the University administration over the past three decades. Historically, students have had little to no involvement in that process, because it wasn’t until 1998 that ANC 2A saw its first student-commissioner elected.
We have a historic opportunity this fall to elect three current GW students to the neighborhood’s highest governing body, alongside two incumbent commissioners that are GW alumni. The potential for Foggy Bottom to have five ANC commissioners – a majority of the commission – in January that are current or recent GW students is something that should excite the University community.
As for myself, I am most excited about potentially having the opportunity to serve Foggy Bottom residents as an effective, engaged commissioner who represents all of the people in my district and just happens to be a student. I am as invested in this neighborhood as any non-student resident, and emblematic of that is my proud service on both the Student Association Executive Cabinet and the Foggy Bottom Association Board of Directors.
Students have a role to play in making Foggy Bottom a better place to live, learn and recreate. While my opponent is correct that the ANC doesn’t exactly deal with “sexy” tasks, it also wouldn’t be a “miserable” time for me either. If it is for him, I’d be more than happy to relieve him of his misery Nov. 6.

A lot can go wrong in 140 characters.
I am not a Twitter user myself, but I have seen others post about their days, articles they’ve read or why they thought U.S. gymnast Gabby Douglas’ hair was too straight during the Olympics.
But Twitter and all forms of social media are inherently dangerous tools. It only takes one erroneous tweet, YouTube video or Facebook status on the part of a business employee to seriously damage the reputation of any institution. And GW is no exception.
GW is working to develop its own social media policy for its employees, University spokeswoman Latarsha Gatlin said. And while it is impossible to prevent small social media gaffes, steps can be taken to help mitigate potential issues at a University with more than 6,000 employees.
Before you accuse me of needlessly babysitting a set of smart and capable adults, a review of social media faux-pas demonstrates how easy it is to misuse these Internet tools.
In 2010, two Domino’s Pizza employees posted a video on YouTube that showed one employee putting cheese up his nose and then placing it on a sandwich. During the political upheaval in Egypt last January, an employee from Kenneth Cole tweeted that the protesters in Cairo must be excited because of the new collection that the company was releasing that spring.
In the case of almost every fumble, each company was forced to deal with a public relations mess that caused irreparable damage to the business’ brand.
GW’s new policy should mandate that all employees using social media have a disclaimer stating that they work for the University, and that any views expressed are their own and do not necessarily reflect GW’s. For example, Cisco has a clear description of when it is necessary for their employees to identify themselves as part of the company, and how to attach appropriate disclaimers to their posts.
But besides telling employees what not to do, GW can also use this opportunity to demonstrate how to use social media to promote the University. A report from the consulting firm the Altimeter Group stated that “some companies fail to define business objectives for social media…” IBM has a section of its policy which discusses which social media posts add value to the entire company. Tufts University provides pointers about how to most effectively use social media, and even includes model Tweets from Tufts employees. By illustrating to all employees how social media can improve the image and messaging of the University, this institution can have a vibrant online presence.
The Altimeter Group stated that, “written [social media] policy is not sufficient on its own – companies must establish a baseline process to reinforce and update the policy, as well as train incoming hires.” A training session could explain to employees the social media policies, and provide examples of how employees at other organizations misused social media as well as the lessons learned from their mistakes.
GW could also provide updates and best practice information for social media through email or newsletters, a practice that several companies have experimented with in the past.
Employees at many companies are extremely liable to #judgmenterrors when using social media. Unfortunately, these judgment errors not only affect the individual involved, but can also have unwanted consequences for the institution that an employee represents. It only makes sense that the University does all it can to prevent a social media disaster.
