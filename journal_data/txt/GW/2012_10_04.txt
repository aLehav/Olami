The University unveiled Tuesday key pieces of a 10-year strategic plan that will retool nearly every corner of GW by doubling the number of international students and hiring up to 100 new professors.
Provost Steven Lerman told the Faculty Assembly that the more than $110 million proposal is the starting gun for a period of major investments in faculty hires, funding for Ph.D. students and new research centers. The plan will also call for new study abroad programs and more interdisciplinary work to push students and faculty into multiple fields.
The decade-long blueprint also puts a permanent stamp on several ideas already trumpeted during University President Steven Knapp’s tenure, including global growth and interdisciplinary research.
“This plan will be all about making the University something more than the sum of its parts,” Lerman said. “It’s about building greatness for the University around a common shared set of themes, a common shared vision that leverages the great aspects the University has created over the last 190 years of its history.”
Savings from the cost-cutting Innovation Task Force will support the plan, Knapp said. He founded the ITF in 2009 to brainstorm where administrative or academic dollars could be spent more efficiently.
Fundraising will also play a major role. Through gifts, the University is looking to pump an additional $200 million into the plan as it pans out.
“I think it’s an ambitious, but not at all an unreachable goal,” Knapp said in an interview after the Faculty Assembly.
Lerman, the University’s second-in-command, has spent more than a year drafting the plan, which will be presented to the Board of Trustees Oct. 19. The board will weigh in on the final proposal at its February meeting.
‘The boldest part of the plan’
The change that has generated the most buzz under the plan, Lerman said, is the move to admit undergraduates to the University as a whole – rather than to a single school. That change would make it easier for students to double-major and for faculty to draw up courses that push a set of “core competencies” for the University, he added.
It would also require admissions policy and curriculum changes, as well as an overhaul of GW’s budget model for different schools.
In an interview Wednesday, Lerman said administrators have not hashed out what the curriculum would include, but that it would complement what students already learn in their specific schools.
“By creating a university where students are doing more shopping of majors, you want to make sure there are great freshman offerings that expose students to fields that they might not know anything about. Public health isn’t taught much in high school. Engineering isn’t taught much in high school,” Lerman said.
He said he would have to work to convince faculty and deans that the University should move away from school-restricted systems.
“There are many people who think, for us, that this is the boldest part of the plan. There are those who think it’s a great idea and have unbridled enthusiasm for it,” he said. “But there are others who see it as an interesting option, but want to make sure that if and when we do this, we address some very specific concerns.”
He said the idea has been embraced by schools across the country, but added, “It’s a big change for GW, given our history.”
Schools like Stanford, Arizona State and Cornell universities already boast more interdisciplinary opportunities for professors and students.
Faculty Senate committees will begin to hammer out details this semester for a more GW-wide academic vision, a step that Knapp said would help professors “think about the University as a whole, and not just their enclave of the University.”
The interdisciplinary focus will also reach into the research arena. Lerman said GW would open several more research centers like its recent Global Women’s Institute and Computational Biology Institute.
It will pay off for students, too, said Forrest Maltzman, senior vice provost for academic affairs and planning. While 60 percent of arts and sciences students at Princeton University take engineering courses, almost none at GW do, he said.
“I would love for our engineering program to be reaching out to international affairs students and be teaching them courses that are not designed for engineers about third world engineering,” he said.
Charting a global reach
The plan’s global thrust is one of its most far-reaching components. It calls for doubling of the international undergraduate population, which sits at 7 percent, as the University looks to connect students globally and increase its revenue stream. Nearly all undergraduate international students pay full tuition.
Out of the about 2,500 international students at GW, 40 percent come from China and South Korea.
Lerman said the University has looked to Boston University’s 18 percent international student body as a model for foreign growth.
“This suggests to us that this is entirely doable. If you invest in recruiting and building your brand and reputation outside the United States, you can attract talented international students in greater numbers than we do today,” he said.
He said the international growth would push the University to add specialized housing options, more English language courses and international student services.
But the University has not set its sights on branch campuses like the ones New York University has established in the United Arab Emirates and China, he said.
GW has already been at work at some global expansion, with the GW School of Business starting a master’s of finance program in China last year and the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences now planning a global undergraduate degree that takes students from D.C. to China and France over four years.
The University will also expand its study abroad offerings, connecting students with international companies for internships and work opportunities. Lerman said GW would look toward expanding online learning options for those students working abroad so they do not fall behind on coursework.
Maltzman said the plan would rethink study abroad by putting students in more hands-on positions like “working in labs in Germany, businesses in South Korea, campaigns in Israel, and digs in Africa.”
Plans for future students
The strategic plan came under fire last month when Student Association leaders called out administrators for neglecting student life aspects of the University’s future, instead focusing largely on research and academics.
Lerman said his planning group adapted to those criticisms and fused curricular and co-curricular items to their vision.
One major change could include giving academic credit to students who lead student organizations or take part in service projects.
“We want to acknowledge that those activities are important educationally and structure them in some way so students can create a portfolio of experiences,” he said.
Maltzman also pointed to immediate student life projects, like more graduate housing and undergraduate affinity housing.
The University will also increase funding for graduate and Ph.D. students, growing the pool of grants and scholarships available for students who aid professors’ research efforts. The University’s last strategic plan in 2002 also prioritized increasing graduate and Ph.D. merit funding.
Lerman said stipends for Ph.D. students have recently stagnated, putting GW behind the schools it considers its competitors, like NYU and Northwestern.
“When one aspires to play in the big leagues, sometimes you have to put in resources that make it attractive for people to come here,” he said.

Student organizations will have to start planning next year’s budgets early to apply for Student Association funding in late spring for 2013 allocations.
The Student Association Finance Committee is pushing its allocations process up to the spring semester, after the Center for Student Engagement announced a policy that will only allow new groups to form in the spring.
Finance committee chair Alex Mizenko said the move prevented a “logistical nightmare” for groups to wait weeks into the school year for allocations after launching in the spring.
He said the process will also help newly elected executive boards, typically selected in the spring, plan out yearly budgets early so they can get off the ground earlier in the fall.
In past years, groups submitted budgets in mid-September.
But the spring allocations could offer thousands fewer dollars for student organizations because the SA Finance Committee will have only an estimate of its funding pool.
The full budget will not be calculated until students’ credit hours for the fall are processed, Mizenko said. He said the organization will hold a second, smaller round of allocations in the fall, similar to the process currently held in the spring, in which about 15 percent of SA funds are doled out.
“We can’t over-allocate and then owe the University money,” Mizenko said, adding that the SA will count on organizations to be more frugal with their budgets and team up with similar groups for events.
The new allocations process marks the second major overhaul of the process in two years, after the SA created a new allocations process last year that gave out about 85 percent of its budget through fall allocations, rather than two rounds that gave out half the funding at a time.
Student organization registration for this fall will continue to remain open until Nov. 1. For the first time this year, new student organizations could launch without requesting funds from the SA.
The SA Senate passed its allocations bill Monday, doling out more than $800,000 of its total about $945,000 budget.
The Student Association earns $1.50 per credit hour from every student with a University match of 50 cents, but Mizenko said the funding is not enough to fund more than 500 student organizations.
The SA is also moving forward with a referendum to increase the student fee, which will go to a student-wide vote later this semester. The fee was last increased in 2008, adding an incremental 10-cent increase over the last five years.
The last increase took effect in fall 2011, leading this year’s Student Association budget to drop for the first time in five years.
“The student fee will play a big part in this. If it were to go up, we probably could safely allocate this year’s 85 percent, because we know we’ll have higher revenue,” Mizenko said.

Correction appended
The University’s new counseling center director brings two decades of clinical experience to a center that went nearly a year without a permanent head.
Silvio Weisner was hired away from Marymount University, where he said he spent seven years building a counseling center “from the ground up.”
He will lead the UCC starting Oct. 15, equipped with an expertise in counseling LGBT clients, clients affected by HIV/AIDS and deaf clients. Weisner was brought aboard the Arlington, Va. college less than a year after its counseling center was founded. He said he single-handedly hired a staff, created the policies and established the office’s identity on campus.
Mark Levine, the interim UCC director, said the search committee was drawn to Weisner’s balance of a “strong administrative and strong clinical background.”
Levine has led the center since former director John Dages resigned in December 2011, followed two months later by associate director Barbara Brown. Their leadership came under fire last fall, after more than a half-dozen former staff members told The Hatchet their resignations were prompted by poor management and a dysfunctional work environment.
Dages was in charge for two years, while Brown began as associate director in 2004.
Weisner said his first year at the center would largely be “listening and learning,” but he already has a rough outline of the next few years.
A University-wide committee, formed after Dages left last December, recommended more than a dozen improvements to the center, such as increasing awareness of and access to the center, assessing visitor and staff feedback and coordinating with other campus-wide mental health services. It also discussed reviving the UCC’s graduate student training program to bring in full-time interns who would work alongside and learn from the center’s staff.
GW’s training center, which earned certification from the American Psychological Association, attracted graduate and postdoctoral students preparing for licensing tests – until it was nixed in 2008. Levine did not return a request for comment Wednesday about why the clinic closed its training site.
Weisner developed graduate student training programs at both Marymount and George Mason universities, where he served as a staff psychologist for five years. He said he hopes to build up a training site at GW again because, “It’s important for staff to have a connection to education.”
Earning APA certification is a years-long process for most schools, a possibility Weisner said he would look at as part of a three-to-five year plan.
Stephanie Kendall, who completed her APA internship and post-doctorate at GW’s counseling center, said the experience served as the “bedrock” of her clinical career.
“It was a fantastic training programming. I knew I wanted it years before I applied,” said Kendall, who worked at GW’s center from 2005 to 2007. “People talked about it a lot, and I knew it was one of the best training sites around.”
She said bringing back the program would attract top graduate students, and stressed that “more importantly,” it would attract top staff. Kendall, who now works with graduate students at Bentley University’s counseling center, said being a supervisor has forced her to “stay current” on research and best practices.
Kathy Gaitan, who served as office manager of the UCC from 2004 to 2011, said the training program would draw top doctoral students to GW, who might then stay at the center and create “a culture of wanting to work and study at GW.”
The center has struggled to retain staff in recent years. Gaitan, who left in spring 2011, said she knows just two of the center’s current staff members.
The UCC hired 10 new full-time clinical staff members in 2012, including Weisner, five new staff psychologists, a case manager and three post-doctoral fellows, Levine said.
Weisner, who earned his Ph.D. from Gallaudet University, said he also looks forward to meeting regularly with clients. The previous director – Dages – only saw patients on an emergency basis, Levine said. At Marymount University, Weisner saw eight to 10 clients per week.
Naghmeh Merck, assistant director at the Marymount University counseling center, said she was confident that Weisner’s spirit would attract and retain a strong staff, calling him “the best supervisor I ever had.”
“He creates an environment – and has for last 6 years – that makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to work here,” Merck said. “The climate that’s here with the staff, we don’t go seeking other jobs, because we’re happy and were comfortable.”
The University’s search committee included administrators, faculty and students, including Amanda Uhme, co-president of Active Minds, a mental health awareness group.
“[Weisner] was absolutely my favorite candidate that we looked at,” Uhme said, stressing that he was willing to put in time beyond the “9-to-5 job” for student outreach. She said his charisma could put the center in a new light on campus.
“The counseling center has had a bad rep over the past couple of years. Obviously this is not a new counseling center, but it’s the rebuilding, rebranding feeling we’ve been looking for,” she said.

A female student reported she was sexually assaulted Saturday in Strong Hall.
The University Police Department told leaders of the Greek community earlier this month that it was cracking down on underage drinking after four sexual abuses were reported last month, two of which were in Greek housing.
Strong Hall houses only female students affiliated with the Pi Beta Phi and Chi Omega sororities.
The most recent incident, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. Saturday, was referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, according to the UPD crime log. The suspect was an acquaintance of the student, UPD Chief Kevin Hay said.
Sexual assaults reported on the Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses increased by four cases between 2010 and 2011, according to the University’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report released Monday.
Foggy Bottom cases kept steady, with 13 cases reported in 2011 and 12 incidents the previous year, the data showed.
Katherine Goble, president of Chi Omega, did not return request for comment, and Pi Beta Phi’s president, Jessica Payton, did not return request for comment. Marta Cofone, president of the Panhellenic Association, also did not return request for comment.
One more case was reported on the Vern last year, for a total of four incidents. The Vern houses about 180 more students this year – mostly freshmen – and about 680 students overall.
Reports of sexual abuse at GW have steadily increased over the last five years – a trend Deputy Title IX Coordinator and Director of Campus Inclusion Initiatives Tara Pereira said means more students coming forward with cases, and does not necessarily mean an increase in incidents.
“I hope there is a continual increase. Until someone can show me some data to say there are more sexual assaults on this campus, because I don’t believe that’s what’s happening, I believe there are more being reported,” Pereira said.
“We know it doesn’t look pretty, but it means more people are getting help,” she added.
Pereira said it is not uncommon for a victim to report a sexual assault anonymously, because the person may not want his or her name filed in a police report, but that she still meets with the victims and perpetrators following a reported incident.
Pereira began overseeing sexual abuse and harassment policies in July. The University has spent the last two years underscoring the importance of reporting sexual abuses, in line with a national push to increase sexual harassment awareness on college campuses.
Alison Kiss, executive director for the Clery Center For Security on Campus, also said increasing numbers likely indicate that students feel more comfortable coming forward after an incident.
“Sexual offenses are highly underreported, so an increase is not necessarily alarming,” Kiss said. “In many cases, this means that the campus is proactively programming on the topic of sexual assault. If awareness increases, then reporting typically does as well.”

For a quick Mexican fix, Chipotle may suffice, but for an authentic experience, Fuego Cocina y Tequileria promises flavor and fun.
Passion Food Hospitality, the group that brought Burger, Tap & Shake and District Commons to Foggy Bottom, brought a carefully crafted menu and locally sourced cuisine to Clarendon, Va. with an official debut Wednesday.
Meg Mendelsohn, a public relations representative for the restaurant, said that like its Foggy Bottom siblings, Fuego will offer a relaxed atmosphere.
Housed in a bright, open space with light-wood walls and sleek, modern décor, Fuego takes form in two parts. An entire level of the restaurant is devoted to serving up more than 100 different types of tequila, including sipping and hand-crafted liquors, while the other is devoted to dining. A rustic fireplace and custom murals, inspired by traditional images like the Mexican sugar skull, root the restaurant in its old-world, earthy culture.
Fuego Cocina y Tequileria also shares many of the “quirky surprises and design elements” that Burger Tap & Shake and District Commons are known for, Mendelsohn said.
She added that the restaurant was a group effort that utilized a team of chefs and restaurateurs.
“Passion Food Hospitality looks within their own team when conceptualizing and planning their next venture,” Mendelsohn said. “Executive chef Jeff Tunks worked alongside [chef de cuisine] Alfredo Solis extensively to develop and create the menu.”
Solis, a Mexico City native, guided the menu’s development, making sure to include what Mendelsohn called his personal childhood favorites. The menu showcases an array of traditional dishes with modern touches, including tapas-style small plates, nine different types of tacos and house specialties.
Though the menu is notably devoid of burritos – a conscious effort on the part of the restaurant’s development team – familiar favorites such as guacamole ($9) with fresh tortilla chips and salsa ($2) and chiles rellenos ($16) make an appearance.
Like the décor, the menu takes adventurous twists.
Sample an array of small plates to start. Try Dos Equis Steamed Mussels ($13) – served with chorizo, caramelized onions and chipotle cream – or goat cheese and vegetable stuffed Empanadas de Vegetales ($8).
Rather than your classic chicken or beef taco, be daring and try something new such as Lengua, Birria or Calabaza – beef tongue, roasted goat and squash with pickled red onions. Each taco order ($7) comes with two, so order a few and share among friends.
For a heartier meal, take on a house specialty. Carnitas ($17) – slow fried pork – are a Mexican staple, served with housemade corn tortillas. Enchiladas de Marisco ($24) stuffed with shrimp, crab and lobster put a spin on a time-honored classic.
Take a break from Foggy Bottom and head three stops on the Orange Line to sample new flavors at Fuego Cocina y Tequileria.

There is very little that students care about more than finding jobs after they graduate.
The task is undoubtedly daunting, and many students are left wondering the best way to go about marketing themselves to employers.
While the GW Career Center already offers services such as resume critiques and mock interviews, the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences can bolster its career programs by offering one-credit courses designed to refine personal and professional development skills you might not acquire in the typical academic setting.
The idea of offering college credit for such classes is nothing new.
The University of Maryland offers one-credit career courses with titles like “Job Search Strategies” and “Career Clarification: Choosing a Major,” that are designed to help students figure out how to market themselves to employers in their chosen field.
Like any skill, the more you work at job-hunting, the easier it becomes. And with regular guidance from a mentor in a classroom setting, after a few weeks, students will feel more confident in their job searches.
Yes, there are opportunities on campus, like mock-interviews at the GW Career Center, which help students prepare for the job hunt, but many need more than an informal visit once a semester. Realistically, these skills take time to develop. The skills that make a candidate stand out among a sea of resumes require careful care and cultivation beyond a rushed session in the Marvin Center.
These classes would not be meant to replace or discredit the Career Center, but instead to enhance and complement its existing programs and services. In fact, the Career Center and the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences could partner to create career development courses.
The Elliott School of International Affairs provides graduate students professional skills courses to prepare them for the workforce, and the School of Business requires undergraduate freshmen to participate in a two-semester course that covers resume writing, networking and advice on how to meet academic and professional career goals.
Surely, if the University is willing to offer one-credit lifestyle, sport and physical activity courses, there is no reason it should not offer the same incentive for classes that could help students find jobs after they have been handed their diplomas.
And the one-credit GPA boost for having participated in professional and personal development courses would be an extra incentive to those students who are unsure it is worth their time.
At a time when the economy is struggling to stay afloat, the University should expand the scope of professional and personal development beyond one-time services to help give its students an edge.

Alumni WeekendThis year’s Alumni Weekend brought a record turnout of 2,800 former Colonials, many of whom attended a concert by the classic funk band Earth, Wind & Fire. While students and alumni were singing along to famous tracks like “September” and “After the Love Has Gone,” University President Steven Knapp’s bongo solo was an added bonus.
National Zoo Panda CubThe National Zoo lost its newest member last week when Mei Xiang’s panda cub died six days after it was born. This was unfortunate news for the D.C. community, and the editorial board is saddened by the death of this much anticipated new born.
Dakota Smoke Detector Fails to ActivateA malfunctioning clothes dryer caught fire at The Dakota residence hall Sept. 10, forcing 50 students out of their rooms for a week and caused more than $340,000 in damages. But what is most concerning is that a D.C. Fire and EMS investigation found the smoke detector in that room failed to activate. The University said it checks smoke detectors regularly, but it is troubling to hear that in the event of an emergency, an alarm failed to go off. Steps must be taken to prevent this in the future.
Bill O’Reilly & Jon Stewart DebateGW frequently plays host to the nation’s political bigwigs and television personalities. On Saturday, Lisner Auditorium will host “The Rumble,” a debate between Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly and Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart. The downside: Only 100 tickets were available to students at a price of $25. When big name speakers come to campus, it is a shame to see students who waited in line at the box office for hours get turned away – and then charged $5 to watch online.
GW’s Green MakeoverWhen University President Steven Knapp first took the helm in 2008, Sierra Magazine rated GW one of the least environmentally friendly schools in the nation. Since then, the administration has taken an all hands on deck approach to becoming more sustainable. Last week, the University announced a $5.3 million push to make campus buildings, like Gelman Library and Lisner Auditorium, more green, which would in turn save energy and money on electricity bills. We are encouraged by the University’s continued commitment to going green.
UAsk in GW MobileA national group established the UAsk App for smartphones in September, creating an application for students to find resources at eight colleges across the District in the event that they are sexually assaulted. The editorial board had one concern: Would the information be accessible if it was not looped into an application students already use? Deputy Title IX Coordinator Tara Pereira said she is working to incorporate the UAsk app into the more commonly used GW Mobile App. It is reassuring to see the administration taking concrete steps to promote awareness of resources on campus.

You may remember me
My name is Jaggar DeMarco. I am a freshman here at GW and I am studying political communication. You may remember me from the article, “Students with disabilities look to connect,” (Sept. 27, p. 1).
Although I am happy the article brought the school’s attention to some aspects of living life with a disability, I feel there are some things that were misrepresented, not only about myself, but also about people with disabilities as a whole. There have been some very understanding individuals whom I have subsequently met because of the article, but the last thing I want from anyone is pity. I feel as though the article portrays me as a victim – something that I do not consider myself. My story and situation are vastly different from how they came across in the article; therefore, I want to clarify a few things.
Yes, my transition to college has been difficult, but I feel that most freshmen have a difficult time transitioning too. Nothing in my life has come easily, but that does not make me want to give up. It instead makes me want to persevere. I am used to a challenge, and I do everything in my power to overcome each and every one of them. Some things are accomplished much easier than others, but the challenges I have faced in my life have made me the person that I am today. If anyone were to ask me if I would take away my disability, I would say “no.” My disability has had a direct impact on who I am and who I will become, and I am proud to say that I like who I am.
I know that one of my purposes in life is to teach other people how to interact with individuals with disabilities. I know it’s easier just to avoid the situation of getting to know a person with a disability in the first place, but if you take the time to get to know us, you will learn a lot more than what you expected. We have a perspective on life that many people do not have. We don’t take anything for granted, and often times the simplest things make us smile and laugh. Don’t be scared to make a fool of yourself when getting to know someone with a disability. I make a fool of myself at least five times a day, then laugh and move on.
I never expected everyone to be my friend or even like me, but I want everyone to at least know my story. I am from New Jersey; I am extremely into politics; I love watching TV and movies, and I love to laugh. And yes, I am voting for President Barack Obama and am proud of it. I love Lady Gaga and am excited to see her live in February. I realize that I am not the only one with a story at this school. We were all admitted or came to this school because our individual stories led us here. It is vital to our community that we share our stories with one another. I want to hear your story. I am here to grow and learn just like you.
Jaggar DeMarco is a freshman majoring in political communication.
