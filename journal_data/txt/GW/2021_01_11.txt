More than 20 faculty members, graduate students and administrators who identify as political scientists signed an open letter calling for President Donald Trump to be removed from office through the impeachment process or through the 25th amendment.
The letter comes after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday, the same day members of Congress were working to finalize President-elect Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election. The letter states that Trump’s actions to reject a peaceful transfer of power, his efforts to pressure election officials to overturn state election results and his role in inciting the Capitol riots “threaten American democracy.”
Signers include members of the American studies and political science departments in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, Elliott School of International Affairs, School of Media and Public Affairs, Graduate School of Political Management and GW Law.
“Our profession seeks to understand politics, not engage in it, but we share a commitment to democratic values,” the letter states. “The President’s actions show he is unwilling or unable to fulfill his oath to protect and defend the Constitution. He should be removed from office immediately before further violence takes place or further damage is done to our democracy.”

University President Thomas LeBlanc made a statement last month that would surely only serve to boost his popularity – despite new vaccination efforts, a “full” return to campus this fall seemed “unlikely.” 
LeBlanc later clarified his remarks, explaining that officials are scoping out ways to ensure everyone can come back to campus this fall. His clarification, while more optimistic than his initial statement, is still disappointing. 
Dismay about the comments on social media was widespread, as many hoped the proliferation of two vaccines would fast-track the University’s reopening plans. On the Facebook page Overheard at GW, a post sharing LeBlanc’s original remarks garnered nearly 60 comments, most lamenting the statement and questioning the rationale. Another post on the matter, this time on Reddit, saw a student call the ongoing online model “borderline theft.” Earlier that same day, a video posted on the same forum showed CNN coverage of a woman getting vaccinated in the GW Hospital, a facility which administered many of D.C.’s first vaccines. 
These two posts show conflicting realities for officials. On one hand, LeBlanc has not given a concrete answer on what our return to campus plan is despite increased vaccinations. On the other hand, hundreds of vaccines are being administered next door in our own facilities. While vaccination efforts remain in Phase 1a – reserved for health care workers and related associates – vaccine doses are expected to be available to the general populous as early as this spring. Not everybody will be vaccinated by fall, that much is true. But it’s equally true that GW owes a substantial debt to its students who have sacrificed such an integral component of their college experience. LeBlanc asked for ways to make the community safe for a full return, so here’s an idea: Bring every student back to campus and vaccinate every last one of them.
By fall this year, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all vulnerable populations will already have been vaccinated, allowing students with immunodeficiencies to return to campus virtually risk-free from the get go. From then on, it’s just a matter of strategically planning hybrid classes for the student body. As one option, classes could have one in-person meeting per week, streamed online, for vaccinated students, and another masked and distanced meeting for unvaccinated students, also streamed online. This would allow students to continue their education in the city in a safe manner. Another option would be allowing students to trickle into in-person classes as they become vaccinated in the fall.
Even without vaccinations available, several universities had returned all students to campus last fall with promising results. The Ohio State University, for instance, brought students back to campus on Aug. 23, and per their reporting data, has since recorded only 5,570 positive tests over 259,933 administered. Considering more than 60,000 students had returned to their Columbus campus, they tested each student on average four times, and less than 2.5 percent of those tests came back positive. OSU’s data is bonafide proof that well-enforced student housing guidelines and an organized rollout plan can significantly curb the spread of COVID-19 among students, allowing a full return to campus in the fall. Add to this the possibility of universal vaccination for students, and what results is surefire, reliable means to ensure every single student can get the in-person learning experience they are paying for.
Some may point to the tanking economy or its own financial woes as a reason the University may not be able to afford to vaccinate every student. While the economy has surely failed for many, those invested in the market, like the University’s own endowment fund, are much better off than was suspected in March. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all at record highs, and the real estate investment market is doing well as apartments in major cities are refilled. GW even appears to be hiring real estate consultants, a move they’d be unlikely to make if they were strapped for cash. 
If anything, the University owes such a measure to their students after a lengthy pandemic and the academic sacrifices they’ve made. It’s just a matter of GW putting in the legwork and sticking its neck out for their students, a gesture sure to be a breath of fresh air for a student body that hasn’t had one in quite some time.

Pinto said homelessness in Foggy Bottom is a major issue she aims to confront during her first full term.
Brooke Pinto entered the D.C. Council during an unprecedented moment in local D.C. politics.
Pinto completed the term of former Ward 2 Council member Jack Evans – the longest-serving lawmaker in D.C. history – who resigned amid an ethics scandal five months prior. As she stepped into office, the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice protests were sweeping through D.C.
Now, as she prepares for a full term in office as Ward 2’s first-ever female representative, Pinto said she plans to prioritize addressing COVID-19 business recovery and Foggy Bottom’s homelessness crisis. Pinto said she hopes to bankroll struggling workers and small businesses and build trust with homeless communities while working to supply them with permanent housing.
“It has been a very busy first six months, a very important time for our city both with the devastating effects of COVID-19 and working to help folks and families and businesses recover but also with the demand and calls for criminal justice, racial justice throughout our city, and we take those responsibilities very seriously,” she said.
Pinto’s first six months in office have been highlighted by key legislation for Ward 2 and the District at large. She’s voted to establish the D.C. Police Reform Commission and distribute additional financial COVID-19 aid for businesses and laid-off workers while engaging with constituents like local leaders, people experiencing homelessness and unemployed workers in the ward, which includes Foggy Bottom.
Pinto identified the COVID-19 pandemic as the “biggest problem” currently facing local neighborhoods like Foggy Bottom, as small businesses struggle to identify sources of revenue under tight restrictions. She said the Council recently passed a reinstatement bill that requires businesses to rehire laid-off employees amid the pandemic once their positions reopen.
As the pandemic continues to cripple small businesses, Pinto said she’s worked through legislation to extend unemployment benefits, provide additional grants for small businesses and approve the use of “streateries” – outdoor seating areas that restaurants create to maintain service and accommodate health restrictions. She said restaurants can continue using licenses for streateries through December because of legislation she introduced and helped put into effect last October.
“We think the biggest problem right now is around COVID and the effect that it has had on our workers who are trying to get back to work,” she said.
Pinto added that more students returning to the Foggy Bottom Campus could help alleviate the financial strain on small businesses in the area. GW officials expect nearly 4,000 students – about one-third of the student population – to return to Foggy Bottom in the spring semester.
“We are looking forward to welcoming students back,” she said. “It’s really important to our city to have the students be a part of it for their college experiences, for support for our local businesses. It’s really an important aspect of Ward 2, and we’re thrilled to see that.”
But more students in the area might illustrate a health risk of its own – a string of large student gatherings last fall sparked fears that other students and local residents could be infected with the novel virus. Pinto said D.C. officials must enforce COVID-19 restrictions, like the city’s mask mandate and gathering limitations, to slow the contagion’s spread.
She said the Council has worked with the Metropolitan Police Department, the Alcohol Beverage Regulation Administration and the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs to ensure “the public health crisis is taken seriously.” Pinto said she’s also encouraged Mayor Muriel Bowser to enforce gathering limitations, which permit a private group of 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors.
Pinto said homelessness is another “huge issue” she’s committed to confronting in Foggy Bottom, where students have rallied for years to protect unhoused residents at an encampment on E Street. Pinto said she voted for a technology tax bill provision last summer that allotted $5 million for permanent housing vouchers and said 200 permits were distributed in D.C. last month.
“The best way to assist our neighbors experiencing homelessness is to give them permanent, supportive housing and adequate wraparound services so that folks aren’t back on the street in one year’s time,” she said.
Pinto said she’s also collaborated with nonprofits, the District’s Department of Human Services and the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services to distribute personal protective equipment to homeless communities for COVID-19. Bowser is developing plans to cut funding for nonprofits who supply homeless communities with social services, DCist reported last month.
Local leaders said they have established a positive rapport with Pinto, who has been receptive to neighborhood complaints as simple as moving a portable toilet from a local playground during her tenure in office so far. Members of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, whom Pinto has invited to personal meetings to discuss local issues, said they hope the Council member prioritizes the pandemic’s impact on jobs and public health during the next four years.
Commissioner Jeri Epstein said she’s “very impressed” by Pinto’s first six months in office, and she’s confident Pinto will continue to be an effective representative of the Ward 2 community. Epstein said Pinto and her office have responded to her concerns, involving issues like sidewalk repairs and homeless encampments, where Pinto has sent nonprofit workers to connect residents with health and housing resources.
“She has made a huge effort to understand the position and get people in her outreach group who are very productive and very good communicators, so that is why I think they’re going to be good as a group,” she said.
Commissioner Trupti Patel said she called Pinto about an illegal drug operation running out of her district last summer, to which Pinto was “very responsive.” She said her collaboration with Pinto helped resolve the issue, which resulted in an arrest and conviction.
Patel said she urges Pinto to expand COVID-19 relief aid for local hospitality workers – including hotel and restaurant employees – whom she identifies as the group the pandemic has hit the hardest financially in Ward 2. Patel said those who might be struggling without jobs or much income may not have the ability to contact city officials on a regular basis, but they should still be heard from D.C. lawmakers like Pinto.
“I hope she realizes that Ward 2 is comprised of nearly 60,000 residents, and all 60,000 may not have the ability to vote for her,” she said. “But they have voices, and they have opinions. And they matter too.”

The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission seat representing a large swathe of campus is vacant.
For the first time this month, much of the University’s student population doesn’t have direct representation on a local governing body.
The district known as 2A08 is the only sector of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission that relies on a student to represent a constituency, which is nearly entirely comprised of GW students – aside from University President Thomas LeBlanc’s on-campus residence. Former commissioners said the COVID-19 pandemic drained the area of potential candidates, and the district will lose a voice that has elevated students’ interests for years.
“What makes 2A08 unique is that it’s effectively a 100 percent student district, where nearly 100 percent of the residents living in that district are undergrads at GW, and so that has a particular importance due to the impact that the students have,” said Peter Sacco, the executive director of the Foggy Bottom and West End ANC, who served as a student commissioner for 2A08 from 2013 to 2015.
The 2A08 seat has not been vacant since 2013.
Sacco, an alumnus, said the empty seat marks the first time the ANC has faced a vacancy immediately following a general election, and the commission is consulting with the D.C. Board of Elections to determine how to fill the seat. The BOE typically allows ANCs to fill a vacancy mid-cycle, next January, but city officials suspended the process during the pandemic because each commission must hold an in-person election to fill a seat, he said.
Sacco said he expects “a lot of advocates” to press city officials to help fill the vacancy, but lawmakers might be too distracted with other “big issues” surrounding the pandemic or recent riots to prioritize a solution.
“The city is facing a lot of big issues with the pandemic right now, and unfortunately I don’t think that addressing these vacancies is the highest priority right now,” he said.
Alumnus James Harnett, the most recent representative of 2A08 who became the youngest chair of an ANC in D.C. history this summer, called for city officials to install a crosswalk on H Street and bike lanes on 20th, 21st and G streets during his tenure. Harnett, who spoke with a few students considering running for the seat last year, said the pandemic pushed them home, leaving them unable to run for the seat.
“COVID-19 is what happened and with only about 500 students on campus this past semester, there simply weren’t enough people that were here that interested that would have been able to run for it,” he said.
Harnett said the seat can facilitate greater physical change in Foggy Bottom, like infrastructure improvements and public safety measures like new crosswalks. Harnett used his position on the ANC to vote for expansions to the Capital Bikeshare system, sidewalk extensions and a project that would renovate part of Pennsylvania Avenue.
“If we don’t have somebody at the table, to fight for those priorities in this district, we’re not going to see the sort of change we need to see, to keep people safe in our neighborhood, to make living here more affordable, to make sure that the government is really working for young people,” Harnett said.
When he was a student commissioner, Harnett would speak with students during meetings on campus to share neighborhood updates, gather student feedback and relay input back to other commissioners.
Harnett said Yannik Omictin, a senior who emphasized student engagement ahead of his election to the ANC’s 2A01 seat in the fall, will help keep student interests in mind on the commission during his tenure. Omictin represents a district that includes residential buildings, like Mitchell and Thurston halls.
“I expect folks like Yannik Omictin, who is a GW student and is elected in a district that is majority students while not being a universal student district, will step up to the plate and make sure that the views of young people and students are represented in these conversations,” he said.
Harnett said Omictin’s election still isn’t necessarily enough to amplify student voices, as Omictin “needs allies” like other students to fully represent their peers’ interests.
He added that community improvement projects unique to 2A08, like new outdoor space for GWorld vendors, likely won’t slow down due to the vacancy because other commissioners will step up to the plate instead.
Eve Zhurbinskiy, a former student commissioner who served 2A08 from 2015 to 2017, endorsed a plan to give students unlimited Metro passes – a measure the University ultimately shot down – and advocated for the installment of a helipad at the GW Hospital. She said the helipad’s construction, which Harnett urged the Student Association to support through a D.C. Council testimony, underscored the significance of student advocacy on neighborhood issues.
“This is really an opportunity for whoever’s the student commissioner to really represent the voices of the student body and the community and kind of work on issues that impact students,” she said.
Zhurbinskiy, an alumna, said the seat is critical because it allows a student commissioner “to work on issues that impact students” and represent the needs or concerns of the student population at ANC meetings while not many students would be otherwise invested in the neighborhood.
“A lot of students don’t get involved locally in the community, and they’re focused on classes or they’re focused on national politics, which is all well and good, but that is a way to amplify student voices and make them heard in a broader community, and that’s why that seat is so important,” she said.
Zhurbinskiy said since most students vote in their home state and don’t pay attention to local D.C. politics, not many know enough about the ANC to launch a bid for 2A08, but she’s interested in speaking with anyone willing to learn about running.
“What happens on the ANC-level in Foggy Bottom can impact students in their day-to-day lives, whether that’s deciding how late in the night construction on campus can continue or discussing how to make H Street between Kogan and Marvin safer for pedestrians,” she said.

Program guides provided first-year students with resources, like student care packages, a template for a first year ‘time capsule’ and reflection exercises for students.
Updated: Jan. 11, 2021 at 10:51 a.m.
First-year students enrolled in the Division for Student Affairs’ newest mentorship program said the program has provided them with emotional support as they navigated their first semester of GW.
DSA launched Thrive GW, a mentorship program for first-year students to connect with staff, students and alumni while studying remotely last fall. Students involved in the program said their mentor has eased their transition to GW, and they could lean on them for tips on academics and mental health.
Senior Associate Dean of Students Colette Coleman said the program is intended to create connections for new students who were not going to have a traditional first-year experience. She said guides and students were matched before the academic year started based on academic, career and recreational interests.
Students interested in receiving a mentor can fill out a form to be paired with an alumnus or DSA staff, according to the Office of Student Life website.
“Guides help new students orient to and engage in the GW community and find the necessary support to foster student success,” Coleman said in an email. “In these uncertain times caused by COVID-19, guides serve as trained, experienced and enthusiastic ‘anchors’ to help first-year students feel connected to GW.”
She said guides are expected to check in and meet as a group with students every few weeks and at key points of the semester, like midterms and finals. She said each guide was trained over the summer and leads group activities, which could include sharing academic support resources or biweekly updates of University news.
“Guides have been very creative in their approaches,” Coleman said. “Among these activities have been student care packages, a template for a first year ‘time capsule,’ a monthly GW historical trivia challenge and reflection exercises for students for the fall term.”
Kristin Fahlbusch, an alumna from the Class of 2005, said she “immediately” volunteered to serve as a guide after hearing about the program. She said she received an email in late July from Coleman and Director of Office of Military and Veteran Student Services Andrew Sonn introducing Thrive GW and asking alumni to serve as guides.
Fahlbusch, who mentors two students, said she used to volunteer with DSA during Colonial Inauguration, now known as new-student orientation, as an orientation guide and was excited to “get back into that role.” She said she checks in with her mentees via text at least once a week and makes herself available in case they want to chat.
“I’m in constant contact with my girls,” Fahlbusch said. “They have my cell phone number. They know that they can call or text me anytime with any issues that they’re facing.”
She said she sees herself as a “liaison” for her mentees, responsible for connecting them to resources at school like DSA if they need help resolving any issues related to school or their personal lives. She said although she is not an academic adviser, she helped one of her students last semester after the student had technological issues with recording part of her final foreign language exam.
She said meetings revolve around a theme, like finding student organizations or juggling responsibilities at home and school. She said she’s encouraged her students to remain engaged in the GW community while online by helping them find classes and student groups that fit their interests.
“From the beginning of my students’ Thrive experience, I wanted to make sure that they felt comfortable and had this self confidence and that they were open to the idea of creating and discovering new ways to make friends, connecting with other students,” Fahlbusch said.
Undergraduate mentees in the program said their mentors’ enthusiasm has helped them acclimate to GW from home.
Anissa Ozbek, a freshman majoring in international affairs, said she reached out to DSA in late August after hearing some students talk positively about the program in a GroupMe for students in the Elliott School for International Affairs. She said since her parents did not attend college in the United States, having a mentor to answer questions and empathize with her experience has made her feel more confident navigating school during the remote semester.
Ozbek said her mentor has sent her monthly cards and care packages full of GW merchandise, which she said has been an “exciting” part of the program. She said having her mentor as a person to vent to has made her feel more comfortable and a part of campus even while online.
“Having someone older, that’s an alumnus from GW, has been so great to just hear about their experiences and have someone there to support you that knows what you’re going through,” Ozbek said. “It meant a world of difference.”
Junior Haley Lanford, a transfer student from Northern Virginia Community College, said her academic adviser referred the program to her. She said Thrive GW has given her an opportunity to “decompress” from the stresses of studying online and reach out to someone she feels comfortable with if she needs advice.
Lanford said her mentor has helped her with issues like deciding on which classes to take Pass/No Pass and finding a balance between coursework and Zoom fatigue. She said having a mentor has helped her feel less alone while trying to socialize with other peers online.
“It’s been such a nice way to decompress and talk to somebody who can help navigate if I’m having any problems or help to make decisions about something,” Lanford said.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Fahlbusch’s first name is Kaitlin. Her name is Kristen. We regret this error.

Kym Rice, the interim director of the arts and design school, said the new degree program is aimed at undergraduates with an education in interior design.
Administrators from the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design will launch a Master of Arts in interior architecture program this fall.
Kym Rice, the interim director of Corcoran, said the school currently offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a Master of Fine Arts in interior architecture, but the latter is for those who have a bachelor’s degree in a field other than interior architecture. She said the new master’s degree, which is a one-year program, enables students with undergraduate experience in interior design to fine-tune their skills and apply for higher-level positions in the field.
“We have had significant interest in the new program and already have applications in progress for fall 2021,” Rice said in an email. “Prospective students have inquired about this kind of degree for the last several years.”
She said officials did not hire any new faculty and staff members for the program but will work with the University to reevaluate the need for additional faculty and staff for the program over time.
Rice said the COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged prospective master’s students to seek to improve their skills to become “more competitive” in the current job market. Higher education experts say graduate school applications have increased in recent months as some jobs become far and few during the pandemic.
“The program is also specifically designed to help them develop invaluable connections with the D.C. design community,” Rice said.
The program’s curriculum includes courses in architectural design theory and leadership in design positions, according to the program’s website.
Stephanie Travis, an associate professor of interior architecture and the interior architecture program head, said Corcoran officials have been discussing the program for “many years.”
She said administrators often receive “strong” applications to the existing graduate program for interior architecture, intended for those without prior experience in interior design, that they needed to reject because the applicants already had a degree in the field. The new program welcomes applicants with prior experience in the field, she said.
“We wanted to be sure that this program would challenge students who already have a design background and that this degree would take them to the next step in their career,” she said in an email. “We also had to get approval from a number of channels, including the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, of which the Corcoran is an accredited member.”
Travis said the master’s degree also accommodates for Corcoran undergraduates who have expressed interest in continuing their study of interior architecture through the Grad2Grad program, which allows undergraduates to complete another degree at GW with a 10 percent tuition discount after finishing their bachelor’s degree.
“We worked extremely hard to create a studio-based curriculum that would push students to think conceptually and creatively and to emphasize leadership and collaboration,” she said. “Our unique location in the Flagg Building directly across the street from the White House will allow for many D.C.-based projects that involve the community or focus on global issues, something that we are really excited about.”
Experts in architecture and design said the program should emphasize inclusivity in design-related jobs and encourage students, many of whom may become leaders in the field, to consider how cultural biases are present in the occupation.
Mina Chow, an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California’s School of Architecture, said when she first entered the field of design, those she worked with sometimes misidentified her as an interior designer rather than an architect because of her gender. She said it’s crucial for the new master’s program to ensure that the curriculum’s materials are inclusive and support diversity, equity and inclusion.
“There’s a lot that needs to be addressed in regard to gender,” she said. “Things need to be updated because there’s a lot happening in this country that is being questioned about its equity, diversity and inclusion, which should make us question traditional roles in design.”
Chow said officials in the program should provide a diverse group of faculty and staff who can serve as role models for underrepresented students.
“They need to see underrepresented people in positions of power and their work having a positive effect on society,” she said.
Dennis Earle, an assistant teaching professor of environmental and interior design at Syracuse University, said the program should also encourage students to consider how personal biases and expectations might influence design practices and prepare students for “enlightened, progressive leadership” in the field of design.
He said the program should dispense more depth of knowledge in interior architecture and should develop students to be leaders in the field of interior architecture.
“Part of it is just more time studying the profession and related subjects, which translates to more information and more practice using such information, and part of it is education at a higher level of complexity, sophistication and performance,” he said in an email.

The organization publishes a weekly spotlight highlighting a successful female leader in an industry called “Wise Women Wednesday.”
Students interested in gaining personal advice from female professionals can join GW’s branch of The Women’s Network, a national organization aimed at normalizing conversations about gender in professional workplaces.
Student leaders said GW’s chapter of The Women’s Network, added to GW Engage last week, will offer networking opportunities and events with industry professionals, like a discussion with a female astronaut. Junior Zoe Eberstadt-Beattie, the president of GW’s chapter, said the organization intends to help members build confidence as they apply for jobs in areas dominated by men.  
“I just found that all of the orgs around me were incredibly competitive things, and they just felt really insecure,” Eberstadt-Beattie said. “It was overwhelming. I didn’t want to be a part of that. When I found The Women’s Network, it was just so clearly about being non-competitive, about empowerment, about being supportive. I was immediately taken in.”
Eberstadt-Beattie said she formed GW’s chapter of The Women’s Network after a friend shared the national organization’s Instagram page with her in July. She said the group has met on Zoom biweekly since they registered with the Division for Student Affairs in September but was not approved as an official student organization until January.
She said the group relied heavily on Instagram to promote itself by following masses of students and consistently posting. She said the group publishes a weekly “Wise Women Wednesday” – a spotlight of a successful female leader in various industries.
She added that members can apply to serve as a campus ambassador, in charge of reaching out to potential members and similar organizations to attend meetings.
Eberstadt-Beattie said the group held seven events on Zoom last semester, like a discussion on working in law with Lisa Beattie Frelinghuysen, a clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She said the organization’s social media director also posts recaps of events for members who couldn’t attend an event to watch.
“With these Zoom conferences, we have the opportunity to bring in more people and to record these sessions so that then people can watch them, when they’re in a whole other time zone across the world,” Eberstadt-Beattie said. 
Jamie Vinick, a 2020 graduate from Syracuse University and the national organization’s founder, said while most universities remain online, the organization has sought to host Zoom events like panel discussions with female politicians and business leaders for anyone at any school to attend.
Vinick said she originally formed the group in 2017 with the mission of creating a space for students to hold honest conversations about entering male-dominated workplaces and advocating for themselves about issues like salaries. She said the organization has expanded to 23 other universities since she graduated last May. 
“My entire time in college, I had to seek out candid conversations related to gender in the workplace,” Vinick said.
Sophomore Sundhya Alter, the vice president of the chapter, said more than 100 students regularly attend events and are subscribed to the organization’s newsletter, many of whom are freshmen interested in meeting other peers while studying online. She said the group plans this semester to emphasize a mix of both professional and community-focused programs, like a LinkedIn workshop series and casual Zoom hangout sessions. 
She said the group collaborated with community organizations like the GW Mutual Aid Network last semester for a fundraising event and has been reaching out to other women empowerment-centered student organizations to host events online. She said while operating online has made it difficult to connect with other students and campus organizations, she looks forward to hosting events like alumni panels with other groups online and eventually in person.
“This semester, we’re going to really try to expand our org and get our presence and our message really out there,” Alter said. “The way that we’ll do this is definitely just through more events and trying to engage as much as we can on social media.”
She said the group also launched a mentorship program last semester, which paired 50 freshmen with 25 upperclassmen mentors to offer advice about course planning, internships and self-care. She said students involved in the program are paired based on their interests in a major or career.
“One thing in the professional world for women is we’re all competing against each other,” Alter said. “And there’s not really that sense of support. And so we wanted to erase that whole message of, ‘ambition is bad.’”

Medical school faculty will help build a state-of-the-art science learning center in a Northern Virginia high school, equipped with augmented and virtual reality technology.
Updated: Jan. 12, 2021 at 2:37 p.m.
Officials from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences received a grant last month to construct a science learning center for a high school in Alexandria, Virginia.
Using a $700,000 grant from Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s Growth and Opportunity for Virginia grant program, which aims to create economic growth throughout the commonwealth, three SMHS faculty will help establish a learning center equipped with virtual and augmented reality technology. The space will become part of the high school’s Governor’s Health Sciences Academy, which SMHS launched in 2018.
Teri Capshaw, the principal investigator in the project and an adjunct professor of clinical research and leadership in the medical school, said the center will include two virtual and augmented reality teacher work stations, 20 student laptops and STEM-H software. She said a company from Columbus, Ohio, is leading the center’s construction and will begin work in the next few weeks.
“Our vision is for this initiative to serve as a best practice for other areas in Virginia and the region,” Capshaw said in an email. “We feel strongly that this innovative model, linking secondary education, community colleges and four-year institutions, will benefit students in numerous ways and better prepare our future workforce in STEM-H fields.”
Kevin O’Connor, an associate professor of medicine and senior medical adviser to the medical school, said among the software available will be a 3D model of the human body that will allow students to simulate dissections.
“The center will incorporate the latest immersive learning technologies to support critical thinking and applied learning to maximize student learning and engagement,” he said in an email. “Our program also offers learning experiences that engage experts in the field and incorporates state-of-the-art AR and VR, so students are provided with an immersive learning experience that builds and promotes teamwork.”
Linda Zanin, the medical school’s director of strategic partnerships, said she learned about the grant opportunity and developed the idea for the center alongside Capshaw and O’Connor, who have together been involved in the Health Sciences Academy since its establishment in 2018.
SMHS leadership established the Health Sciences Academy at T.C. Williams High School to encourage students from lower-income families to join the medical field. Students who are accepted to and attend the academy are guaranteed admission to the medical school.
“We came up with the concept for the Community Medi-Corps Program and the Immersive Learning Center,” Zanin said in an email. “With the support of Dr. Reamer Bushardt, [senior associate dean for health sciences], we invited community partners and neighboring school systems to join us in the initiative and we put our grant application forward.”
Michelle Coffman, the dual enrollment and academy coordinator at T.C. Williams High School, said the learning center will help them excel in their STEM courses.
“The unit also provides a great opportunity to connect with the community and provide experiences for the students outside of traditional classroom settings,” Coffman said in an email. “It will also provide opportunities to work with health programs in neighboring school districts and share best practices.”
A release from Northam’s office states the center will help prepare students for careers in the biomedical, lab sciences and pharmaceutical industries.
Experts in postsecondary education said the center can provide students with hands-on learning experiences and encourage them to stay in STEM and health care fields after graduation.
William Corrin – the director of K-12 education at MDRC, an organization that researches social policy – said high school and university partnerships are beneficial because they smooth the transition for students, making it “less of a gap and more of a bridge.”
“Those transition points are usually the places where there’s the greatest risk for students to experience some kind of disruption to their educational trajectory,” Corrin said.
Max Milder – the director of research at EAB, an education research organization – said partnerships between higher education institutions and high schools can create a pipeline of leading new students to the institution.
“Universities are always interested in how they’re going to continue to attract future students or enrollments in the coming years,” he said. “There’s a part of this that is getting George Washington University in front of high school students as early as possible, even before they’re going into that decision-making process for enrollment.”
Milder said exposing high school students to high-level technology that’s common in medical education familiarizes students with what they’ll be using throughout their medical careers.
“Experiential learning is really critical,” he said. “And that’s true in K-12. That’s true in higher education as well. And so part of the effort here is to bring some of these scientific or medical concepts to life and do so in a way that is really engaging and hopefully fun for the students as well.”

For some students, the need to organize and map out due dates in advance became more important after classes moved online.
With nearly a year of remote learning under their belt, students said they feel more prepared to tackle the challenges of a second full online semester.
Students said throughout the fall, they’ve learned to separate their home lives with class expectations despite working and living in the same space. As universities gear up for another physically distant semester, they said their peers should prioritize organization and maintaining social connections.
From one student to another, here are some tips for succeeding during another virtual semester:
Form a virtual study group
Freshman Emma DeLattre said she formed study groups and signed up for office hour appointments with professors to make up for the lack of in-person interactions.
“I reached out a lot to my professors throughout the semester trying to ask questions, meet them, see their faces so it wasn’t just like I was taking a class with a robot, more or less,” DeLattre said.
She said keeping in touch with her study groups and professors helped her create long-lasting relationships that she can carry over once classes are back in person. After setting up regular Zoom study sessions with a couple of friends to help one another through their statistics course last semester, DeLattre said she now plans to meet up with them in D.C. this spring.
Turn on your cameras and participate
Senior Min Wong said students should turn on their cameras and participate to get the most out of class.
She said one perk of online learning is that professors are more interested in their students’ academic success and overall well-being, given the mental toll of the pandemic. Having her cameras on has forced her to engage in class discussions, retain knowledge and have candid conversations with professors.
“It felt kind of like the professors were really trying to get an in-person and collaborative feeling as much as possible,” Wong said.
Meet your professors halfway 
Senior Alexa Brooks-Major said professors have been generally accommodating throughout the past two semesters, and students shouldn’t take advantage of their flexibility.
“I felt that my professors were more trusting with students,” Brooks-Major said. “It wasn’t a matter of, ‘Oh, why don’t you get this work done?’” but rather, ‘Oh, I understand there’s a lot on your plate right now.’”
Brooks-Major said students should treat their professors with the same care they’re being offered, adding that they should participate and connect with professors as much as possible.
Take control of your workspace
For many students like senior Madeline Hennig, online classes have also paved the way for students to customize their optimal learning environment. Instead of staying at home for the semester, the international business major said she rented an apartment in D.C. with her best friend where the two both studied together and enjoyed one another’s company.
She said organization and planning is essential to ensure all of her Blackboard modules and discussion posts – now a common task for many students – are completed on time. Hennig said this is her first semester using Google Calendar where she sets reminders for the due dates of every assignment for class.
“If I didn’t have Google Calendar, I would have not been able to survive,” Hennig said.
