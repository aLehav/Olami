The stage, laden with beautiful sunflowers, heightened the intimate atmosphere of the venue and produced an ethereal effect as Parks’ delicate yet intense vocals flooded the audience.
Indie-pop artist Arlo Parks brought the “Collapsed in Sunbeams” tour to a sold-out crowd at the 9:30 Club Monday, delivering an exhilarating performance with her signature soft vocals and sultry guitar solos.
Even with a sold-out show, the venue provided an intimate setting for Parks to perform her debut album, “Collapsed in Sunbeams,” on her first-ever headlining tour following her 2018 debut single. The stage, laden with beautiful sunflowers, heightened the tight-knit atmosphere of the venue and produced an ethereal effect as Parks’ delicate yet intense vocals flooded the audience.
Parks first arrived on the music scene following the release of her debut single “Cola” in November 2018. Since then, the success of songs like “Eugene” and “Softly” has helped her build a following of indie-pop fans, assisted by support from more well-known indie-pop artists like Clairo. A United Kingdom native, Parks has experienced great success domestically with “Collapsed in Sunbeams” – the album reached number three on the UK Official Albums Chart in November just five weeks after its release, pushing her to win Breakthrough Artist in 2021 at the BRIT Awards.
After waiting eagerly for Parks to appear 30 minutes after opener Del Water Gap left the stage, the crowd erupted into thunderous cheers as the songstress made her way to the stage to perform her comforting, uplifting track “Green Eyes.” The song, which reflects on homophobia and queer romance, had the crowd entranced from start to finish.
Parks continued the show with songs “Bluish” and “Caroline,” the latter of which drove the entire venue to passionately scream the titular name throughout the chorus per Parks’ request. Seated in the photo pit for the first three songs, I could feel the fervor radiating not only from the crowd behind me but also from Parks on stage, particularly during the electrifying performance of the fan-favorite track. Parks was visibly emotional through her facial expressions and captivating movements.
Before Parks embarked on her first headlining tour, I had the pleasure of seeing her at The Anthem in February when she opened for Clairo’s “Sling” tour. It was my first time seeing Parks live, and as an opening act, she enlivened the audience with a toned-down, relaxed set that placed her laid-back personality at the forefront and kept the audience in tune for the main act.
After the thrilling performance of “Caroline,” Parks performed “Eugene” – Parks’ most streamed hit on Spotify and the song that introduced me to the singer-songwriter in early 2021. The song caught the attention of fellow superstar Dua Lipa, who released a cover of the song last year in the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge, which amassed more than half a million views. “Eugene” was undoubtedly a crowd pleaser. The audience belted its painful lyrics about unrequited love, packed with collective emotion.
The concert continued to flow seamlessly from one song to the next, with recurring themes of healing, catharsis and self-love in songs like “Black Dog,” “Hurt” and “Hope” along with “Too Good” – a groovy throwback that had the audience moving. Parks closed the show with my personal favorite song of hers, “Softly,” an upbeat anthem about bracing for impact in the face of a relationship’s inevitable demise. Parks somehow combines optimistic production with devastating lyrical elements in a way that makes heartbreak feel cathartic – even if just for a few minutes.
By the final song, she left the crowd enthralled by her ability to capture the pure emotions that so many felt in her thoughtful songwriting. With serene vocals and a charismatic persona, Parks put on an unforgettable show and showcased her genuine love for performing with her dazzling smile that charmed the audience all the way through.

In light of the controversy, all reactions to the queen’s death – whether they be in grief, indifference, respect, comedy, celebration or conviction – have undoubtedly gained more than fleeting attention. 
She’s met 13 out of the last 14 U.S. presidents, her face has adorned the currency of 33 different countries and she has been the subject of countless films and television shows including Netflix’s Emmy award-winning series “The Crown.” The late Queen Elizabeth II is arguably the most recognizable modern figurehead in the world, and even in death, she has all eyes on her.
Yet as much as the queen’s death has cast a shadow of solitude over the world in all of the “pomp and circumstance” that has followed her sudden passing last Thursday and the outpouring of mourning from international leaders to everyday passersby, it has also shined a spotlight on England’s not-so-distant colonial rule.
Many took to social media after the queen’s death to criticize Queen Elizabeth and the British monarchy for contributing to the oppression and colonialism that continue to leave lasting effects today. Those in Ireland, Asia and African countries including those still in the Commonwealth – a political association of nations, most of whom are ex-British colonies – still pledge allegiance to the British monarchy.
One Twitter user responded to the queen’s death with screenshots from the popular coming-of-age sitcom “Derry Girls,” which takes place during The Troubles, a 30-year conflict surrounding British rule over Northern Ireland that lasted from the late 1960s to 1998.
“If your lot had stopped invading us for five f*cking minutes there’d be a lot less to wade through. You English pr*ck,” one of the characters to her English cousin in the sitcom said.
Similarly, videos of Irish people celebrating the monarch’s death have gone viral. One in particular shows a stadium chanting “Lizzy’s in a box.” In another TikTok that gained 6.7 million views, an Irish group is step dancing to “Another One Bites the Dust” in front of Buckingham Palace.
The celebratory tweets and ridicule demonstrate a historically founded resentment toward British rule among many Irish people. Though England’s invasion of Ireland dates back nearly eight centuries ago, the monarchy’s determination to conquer and subdue the nation has fueled civil war, religious and political division, population loss and famine. To this day, the island is split into the Republic of Ireland, a sovereign nation, and Northern Ireland – a region of the United Kingdom.
Following the queen’s death, people from countries that were formerly English colonies also called for the return of prized jewels and other artifacts that were taken from their home nations during England’s rule.
“Nations, everyone in England is distracted,” one user tweeted. “It’s the perfect time to get your stuff back from the British Museum.”
Twitter users in India and Africa asked England to return some of their crown jewels, like India’s Koh-i-noor diamond and The Great Star of Africa, reminding the public of their colonial acquisition. Britain came to possess the Koh-i-noor diamond, which is estimated to be about $400 million, through the Treaty of Lahore.
Another Twitter user referenced Killmonger from Marvel’s Black Panther, who took back African artifacts from The Museum of Great Britain in the movie.
“How do you think your ancestors got these?” the character says in the film. “You think they paid a full price for it? Or did they take them like they took everything else?”
People have demanded England to repay ex-colonies and nations that have been affected by British imperialism as recently as this spring. Countries like Jamaica, Belize and the Bahamas have called for reparations for descendants of enslaved people under British colonialism as Prince William and Kate, Princess of Wales, toured the nations in March.
“We stand united in condemning Britain’s savagery in enslaving our ancestors, the coarse indecency of colonial exploitation, the brutality of its enforcers and the enduring legacies of impoverishment and colonial-era ideologies that have damaged and continue to damage our people, our society and our economy,” a joint statement from the three-nation coalition said following the visits from the prince and princess.
Many note that during the queen’s 70-year reign, countries under British rule like Kenya were actively deterred from declaring independence as revolutionaries were tortured, forced into concentration camps and killed, with newly independent countries like Nigeria still under British influence.
One Twitter user responded to a video of a Kenyan woman asking the queen for reparations in June for being tortured by British troops during the fight for Kenyan independence.
“Reminder that Queen Elizabeth is not a remnant of colonial times,” the tweet reads. “She was an active participant in colonialism. She actively tried to stop independence movements & she tried to keep newly independent colonies from leaving the commonwealth. The evil she did was enough.”
Arguably the most striking and viral tweet following the queen’s death comes from an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon, who refers to the monarchy perpetrating genocide and rape.
“I heard the chief monarch of a thieving raping genocidal empire is finally dying,” Uju Anya, who comes from a Nigerian and Trinidadian background, said. “May her pain be excruciating.”
The tweet gained a heated response from many – including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos – and has since been taken down for violating Twitter’s guidelines regarding violence.
In light of the controversy, all reactions to the queen’s death – whether they be in grief, indifference, respect, comedy, celebration or conviction – have undoubtedly gained more than fleeting attention. They have offered insight into all sides of Her Majesty’s complicated legacy and the past of the monarchy itself.
“Black and brown people around the world who were subject to horrendous cruelties and economic deprivation under British colonialism are allowed to have feelings about Queen Elizabeth,” Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah said in a tweet. “After all, they were her ‘subjects’ too.”

As a restaurant server, I always say that my most useful advice is to never look at what any customer tips you until your shift is completely over. When I first started serving, I fell victim to the excitement of seeing how much every guest tipped me the second they left, until I realized that a bad tip ruined my mood and affected my attitude with the next guests which then caused them to tip poorly too. Now, I know to check my tips once I am walking out of the restaurant and instead be upset on my walk home if the money I made was not enough for me – which happens often. On incredibly horrible days, I walk away from a dinner shift with less than $100 after being there for six hours which averages out close to the D.C. minimum wage: $16.10 an hour.
This June, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that D.C.’s minimum wage for tipped workers, including mine at the restaurant North Italia, increased from $5.05 to $5.35 an hour, effective July 1, 2022. Meanwhile, the rest of the workers in D.C. who don’t make their living off a pile of tips make $16.10 an hour at a steady rate. While this increase is a good step in theory, D.C. should abolish tipped wages altogether because the unpredictability of relying on tips is disruptive to a sustainable lifestyle. Paying tipped workers a livable minimum wage, which is close to $23.00 an hour, would provide a steady income for workers, improve restaurant work ethic among servers and free workers’ salaries from the hands of customers deciding how much to add onto their already expensive dinner bills.
Even though tipped wage is meant to even out to the state’s minimum wage in the end, the inconsistency and unpredictability is not sustainable. Instead, politicians, D.C. residents and service industry workers should support Initiative 82, an item on the November ballot that would increase tipped wage over the next five years until it matches the standard D.C. minimum wage at $16.10. Paying tipped workers a minimum wage is necessary for them to have a reliable income, as everyone deserves.
Support from constituents readily exists since 55 percent of D.C. voters passed Initiative 77, an initiative from 2018 that is identical to Initiative 82. Unfortunately, the D.C. Council repealed Initiative 77 because they feared that it would raise costs for establishments which in turn would lead to fewer jobs, increased prices for customers and restaurant closures. But minimum wage is worth fighting for because of those who work these jobs to survive. As a restaurant server myself, I can speak from experience.
Whether it is the 60-year-old server who needs tips to pay for their groceries, the 33-year-old bartender who uses the money they make to support their family and feed their children or the back servers in their 20’s who are paying off their student loans, we all deserve a steady income that we can depend on and know what we will make when we walk into work. It is not fair that I know servers who fail to feed their children one night simply because people didn’t feel like tipping one time around. Sometimes, my coworkers use the money they make during a shift for the basic necessities of that day like commuting home or paying for rent. We all come from different places and have different needs, but none of that means we should rely on customers to pay our way. The restaurant that hired us and makes money off our work should be the ones to compensate us for it.
The restaurant industry fears customers will be stingier with their tips if tipped workers make minimum wage, but they already are because studies show that only 73 percent of people will always tip when they go out. Knowing I do not receive compensation for 100 percent of the work I contribute to my restaurant is very dissatisfying and unfair. It feels like a slap in the face when I give my best effort, running around the restaurant until my feet blister and giving the biggest smile on my toughest days, to make sure all of my customers truly enjoy their service and they simply do not tip. Without a tip, serving a table is pointless because I won’t make any money off of labor. Tipped wage workers should not have to completely waste their time on tables that tip poorly and instead receive compensation through a minimum wage for 100 percent of their work.
Passing Initiative 82 would improve employees’ work ethic because workers would be better motivated to do the work that does not involve serving tables. Tipped workers also polish silverware, fold napkins and restock dishes to contribute to the overall operations of the restaurant. But tipped wage means these duties go unpaid, draining our morale when we have to perform these side-work activities without other customers to assist. If restaurants paid their tipped workers a minimum wage, we would be more willing to do such side work when we’re not serving tables. Establishments would benefit greatly from paying their workers a minimum wage because employees would be happier to perform work that improves the restaurant as a whole.
As the November general election approaches, voters should vote “yes” on Initiative 82 and ensure tipped wage workers receive a real minimum wage. Service industry employees work hard enough to deserve compensation and leaving their wages up to customers who may or may not tip is simply not enough for workers. Restaurants also stand to benefit from employees that are more willing to spend their time and best efforts at their establishments. Ultimately, tipped wage workers need a dependable income and Initiative 82 would provide that.

After watching an impressive "Funny Girl" performance from a cast faced with countless obstacles, I left New York with a different type of appreciation for theater than the one I initially expected.
Ever since my “Glee” obsession in middle school, I have been hoping to hear Lea Michele deliver the famous opening line from “Funny Girl” – “Hello, gorgeous!” – in a packed Broadway theater to a cheering audience.
Michele’s “Glee” character, Rachel Berry, was cast as the lead role of Fanny Brice in the fictional revival of “Funny Girl” in the show’s fifth season. But in real life theater, the original 1964 musical starring the iconic Barbra Streisand had yet to be revived until this year.
“Booksmart” and “Impeachment” actress Beanie Feldstein first held the role of Fanny Brice in the musical’s return but announced an early departure from the show in July, just three months after her opening night. Feldstein’s prompt exit followed sharp criticism of her vocal performance in a musical with Streisand’s big shoes to fill. The Guardian called Feldstein’s voice “paper-thin, reedy in the higher registers and overly nasal throughout” – and with understudy Julie Benko filling in for Feldstein a grand total of 26 times in just a three-month run, it was clear the fan response made its mark on the “Funny Girl” leading lady.
Just one day after Feldstein announced her departure, the production announced that Lea Michele would be cast as Fanny Brice in the musical’s revival starting Sept. 6 alongside Tony Award winner Tovah Feldshuh playing the role of Fanny’s mother. In a musical with inevitable comparisons to Streisand, Michele was an obvious choice, necessary to remedy Feldstein’s poorly received performance.
In the monthlong interim between Feldstein’s departure and Michele’s arrival, the widely acclaimed Benko took over seven nights a week, receiving heaps of support from audiences and critics alike. Benko used her less than recognizable name in comparison to Michele and Feldstein to her advantage. The character of Fanny Brice was an unknown singer who became a star, so audiences watching Benko felt that she represented Fanny in true fashion.
On Sept. 6, Michele made a triumphant return to the Broadway stage to play a role she has essentially been campaigning for since birth – the vocal powerhouse has been on Broadway since she was just eight years old in productions like “Les Misérables,” “Fiddler on the Roof” and “Spring Awakening.” She received four standing ovations before intermission and six by the musical’s finale number, each one led by an emotional Jonathan Groff, Michele’s best friend and fellow “Glee” and “Spring Awakening” alum.
Just seconds after Michele’s casting announcement, I jumped to my computer to frantically purchase tickets to her first Saturday matinee as Fanny Brice. When the big day came, I had no reservations about waking up at 4 a.m. and traveling 10 hours to New York and back in a day by train – after all, I had been waiting for this moment ever since I watched Rachel Berry demolish “Don’t Rain on my Parade” for the first time in the 2009 “Sectionals” episode of “Glee.” Michele’s rendition was the closest to Barbra Streisand in recent decades while still being distinctly personal, captivating audiences on an international level.
When I opened Instagram about an hour before the matinee was scheduled to begin, my heart dropped to my stomach. An announcement posted on the official “Funny Girl” account just one minute earlier read that Lea Michele tested positive for COVID and would not perform until Sept. 20. I was devastated – the musical casting I had been looking forward to not just in the months since buying the ticket, but since watching “Glee” for the first time more than a decade ago, was no longer happening.
Michele posted the news on her account too, saying nearly a dozen cast members also tested positive for COVID, including all three standbys and the original actress for the supporting role of Mrs. Meeker, one of Mrs. Brice’s friends. It is extremely unusual for most Broadway productions to require so many understudies onstage at once – one or two is typical, but 11 is unheard of.
Minutes before the curtains opened, the chaos continued. A producer announced that Barbara Tirrell, whom the production hired as a swing just the day before, would go on for Mrs. Meeker. Tirrell said she made the five-hour drive from Massachusetts to New York that day intending to watch the musical live for the first time, but she learned that she was needed onstage with just 30 minutes to rehearse by the time she arrived. If this wasn’t dramatic enough, the producer went on to say that Tirrell was still on-book, meaning she would be carrying the physical script while she performed on stage, unprecedented for Broadway performances.
Despite the chaotic nature of what was supposed to be an ordinary Saturday matinee, the cast miraculously blended together seamlessly. I would have thought that this group of people performed together seven times a week if I didn’t know any better. The experience was a true testament to the vitality of understudies and standbys to the theater – Tirrell said she later learned that had she been unable to go on, the entire production would have been canceled that day.
Benko shined, as expected, with her phenomenal rendition of “I’m the Greatest Star.” By now, she has proven herself to be a seasoned professional as Fanny and has more than made a name for herself throughout her run. It is clear her success will continue, but Tirrell was the unexpected star of the show Saturday. Her ability to blend in with the other supporting roles without sticking out as someone who had not so much as seen the production run through was admirable and almost unbelievable. In fact, I did not even notice the script in her hand throughout the majority of the first act.
I will undoubtedly be back to see Michele in the role, but after watching an impressive performance from a remarkable cast faced with countless obstacles, I left New York with a different type of appreciation for theater than the one I initially expected – and it was only fitting that a woman named Barbara saved the day.

When I first came to GW, I was excited to escape the outdated closed-mindedness of my small southern hometown of Hickory, North Carolina. I always felt that I did not fit in because it seemed like I was the only person from my area who deeply longed for social progress in our country. Others often saw no issue with the way things were – and sometimes they wanted it to stay that way. But never would I expect students from a progressive institution like GW to make such classist and insensitive remarks about those they may hope to serve and represent.
Moving to the District was everything I thought I wanted – the opportunity to engage with others who were passionate about the same social issues I was. Above all, I was excited to finally be in an environment full of different, accepting perspectives. But the reality is that I’ve come face to face with the stereotype that people from the South are not as educated, progressive or intelligent as their fellow citizens during my time at GW. This stereotype makes me feel uncomfortable while participating in classes and left out of political conversations. But most of all, it turns the real problems southerners face into the butt of countless, harmful jokes.
I spent my high school years engaging in local activism through internships and working with organizations like Michelle Obama’s When We All Vote, fighting for causes like reproductive rights, racial justice and voting equality. Unfortunately, this activism was not always received politely because my political views often differed greatly from those of my peers. But just because I grew up in the South doesn’t mean that I cannot attend a progressive school or understand advocacy and equality.
Being from the South, it seems many often categorize southerners as empty-headed and naive. During my freshman year, a professor jokingly said during a discussion, “You sure don’t seem like you’re from the South.” I was genuinely appalled by this remark. My class was very small, and my professor knew where each and every single one of us was from. Her words echoed in my head – what was that even supposed to mean? I was very vocal in our discussions in that class and felt as though her comment referenced the stereotype that southern people are uneducated or stupid. This stereotype has been constantly perpetuated in the media, often assuming most possess an ignorant mindset. I worried that my intelligence was being questioned and did not feel as comfortable participating in class discussions anymore for the rest of the semester.
My professor’s comments were unfortunately nowhere near the end of the classist remarks I heard and continue to hear about being from the South. Even peers of mine somehow find humor in comparing southern states with crippling poverty and abortion bans to their progressive and accepting Northern home states. I have seen firsthand how many people struggled to maintain a quality life because of the South’s inability to sustain our communities. Nearly one in five individuals who live in Western Carolina live in poverty. Less than 30 percent of all Western North Carolinians have only earned a high school diploma.
It should not be funny to my peers that my home state’s education system is severely underfunded or that I am a constituent of conservative public officials. This supposedly accepting University needs to stop finding humor in the sad reality of underfunded education, abortion bans, deep-rooted racism and so many more issues that the South faces. Trafficking in stereotypes of southerners reveals the ignorance and privilege of this community.
And for all the attention that the South gets, there are plenty of issues in the North that need attention too. From racial segregation in New York City’s public schools to affordable housing in Philadelphia, focusing only on the South sweeps other communities’ struggles under the rug.
I thought GW would bring me to like-minded people who are passionate about making the world a better place. The last thing I expected was to become the butt of jokes about the sad reality of southern poverty. Students should be passionate about addressing issues in the United States and not poking fun at supposed southern incompetence. Issues like financial discrimination, racism and abortion bans disproportionately affect the residents of southern states. So don’t make fun of the South – help fix it.

Senators unanimously approved SA Sen. Ian Ching, ESIA-U, to serve as chair of the finance committee, after the former chair resigned.
Updated: Sept. 15, 2022 at 11:12 a.m.
The Student Association Senate unanimously passed a resolution allocating more than $29,000 to the executive branch’s budget at their meeting Monday.
Faheem Ahmad, the SA treasurer, sponsored the Executive Operational Budget Act, which allocates $29,450 to the executive branch for University-wide events, resources for student organizations and operational costs. The resolution allocates $15,000 to Student Organization Resource Center, $5,000 for the SA office assistant salaries, $4,950 for food and drinks across various student outreach and community building events, $4,000 for program development activities and $500 for SA-related subscriptions.
The resolution allocates $4,000 for the President’s Day Weekend Palooza, which former Executive Vice President Kate Carpenter kickstarted last year, with funding split evenly between money for venue fees and money for food and drink. It also allocates $15,000 for the Student Organization Resource Center, which provides free printing, art supplies and “durable goods” like coffee makers for student organizations, in concordance with the SA bylaws.
Ahmad said this year the SA faces a “constrained” pool of funds due to inflation, which is currently measured at about 8.3 percent. He said the SA hopes to “make the best of” tight funds and begin planning programming for the academic year.
“It is our fullest intention to use our budget responsibly and for the ultimate benefit of the student body, hosting programming that promotes community and belonging for all students at this University,” he said.
The senate unanimously approved the Senate Seats Conversion Act, which converts two graduate seats from the School of Engineering and Applied Science, one graduate seat from the Milken School of Public Health and three graduate seats from the School of Business to Graduate-At-Large seats. The act also converts an undergraduate seat from the College of Professional Studies to an Undergraduate-At-Large seat.
The senate confirmed five new graduate senators.
Samuel Avila, Imani Featherson and Gloria Macrae will represent graduate students in the public health school. Pavan Reddy will represent the graduate students in SEAS and Nicole Blackstone will fill the G-at large seat established in the senate’s last meeting following a lack of applicants from the School of Nursing.
SA President Christian Zidouemba said in his report that he is working with his cabinet and other SA members to continue research on providing Plan B machines on campus.
Vice President Yan Xu said the SA is working with GW Transportation and Logistics Services to collaborate with Lyft to provide discounted electric scooters for students.
“Currently, it’s $1 to rent a scooter and an additional 44 cents per minute to ride,” he said. “And I will go to offer students discounts to explore D.C. to their fullest potential while still being able to return back to campus safely.”
Xu said he will update the student body as GW continues to negotiate with Lyft.
Director and Title IX Coordinator Asha Reynolds and Deputy Title IX Coordinator Kiera Bloore presented on the Title IX office’s prevention trainings and response policies to senators. They said this July, the office convened a Title IX task force, composed of students, faculty and staff across about 21 departments, to address the Department of Education’s proposed updates to federal guidelines.
Senators unanimously approved SA Sen. Ian Ching, ESIA-U, to serve as chair of the finance committee after the former chair, Daniel Sandoval, resigned. Ching said he plans to largely maintain last year’s allocations process and provide information on allocations to student organizations to “ensure stability.”
“Whenever you have a change in the system, people get confused about what the new system is,” Ching said. “It was changed last year, I’m not going to change it again.”
The next senate meeting will be held on Sept. 19 at 8:30 p.m. in the Elliott School state room.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Yan Xu is the executive vice president. Xu is the vice president. The Hatchet also incorrectly reported that the SA is working with GW Transportation and Logistics to collaborate with Lyft to provide discounted electric scooters for students on the Mount Vernon campus. They are working to provide discounted electric scooters for all students. We regret these errors.

The Student Bar Association Senate unanimously appointed two law students to their Student Supreme Court and approved a new technology law organization at their meeting Tuesday.
The Student Bar Association Senate approved a new technology law student organization at their meeting Tuesday.
Senators unanimously passed the Tech Law Students Association Blog Approval Act, which approved the formation of Tech Law Briefly, a student-run blog covering technology law. Sen. Anissa Tanksley – the sponsor of the bill and the chair of the student organization and the charter committee – said the charter committee reviewed and internally voted to approve the Tech Law Briefly’s application before the full senate vote, following an amendment to their constitution.
The Tech Law Students Association submitted an amendment to their constitution specifying policies for the blog’s creation, oversight and dissolution, according to the SBA’s bylaws.
“Their hope is to provide a space where current and timely articles regarding the intersection of technology and law can be available for students,” Tanksley said.
SBA President Nicole Karem also addressed an incongruency between the budget that the University gave the SBA in July and the budget they gave them at the start of the school year. Karem said the SBA believed they were to receive $168,000 in July yet reduced it to $144,000 at the start of the school year.
GW reduced the budget to allocate more student funding toward the University-Wide Programs Fund, which funds large and multicultural events for graduate and undergraduate students to attend. Karem said she was concerned that undergraduate students, not law students, are the ones primarily attending these events.
“The University told us that they did this unilaterally without asking any of the student organizations what they thought about it because they were trying to build community,” she said. “To which I respond, ‘What community?’”
The senate also approved Wolfgang Paulson and Roger Johnson to the SBA Supreme Court, which, like the Student Court, litigates on conflicts having to do with the SBA. SBA Sen. Preston Eagan introduced three nominees, only two of which secured the position, and said all nominees met the necessary requirements.
Two vacancies remain in the SBA Supreme Court, according to the SBA Constitution.
The next Student Bar Association meeting will be held Sept. 27 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

Men's basketball lost Eric Rubenstein, the former recruitment director, when he set off for a job with the Memphis Grizzlies earlier this month.
Following a swift departure from the newly hired director of recruiting for men’s basketball, Head Coach Chris Caputo tapped a former Johns Hopkins University assistant coach to fill his place Tuesday, according to a GW Athletics release.
Matt Colpoys will replace Eric Rubenstein, the former director of recruitment who set off for a job with the Memphis Grizzlies earlier this month after joining the GW team in April with NBA scouting experience. Colpoys coached the Blue Jays while spearheading player development, scouting, recruiting and analytics during their best two years in program history while they totaled a 47-8 record in the 2019-20 and 2021-22 seasons.
He led the team to win a pair of Centennial Conference champions and advanced to two Division III NCAA tournaments in both seasons, the release states.
“I’m grateful to Coach Caputo for giving me the opportunity to be a part of the men’s basketball program at George Washington,” Colpoys said in the release. “After talking with Coach Caputo and his staff and hearing the vision they had for GW, it was something I immediately wanted to be a part of. I can’t wait to get started and get to work.”
Prior to his time with Johns Hopkins, Colpoys worked as an assistant coach for Iowa State University, where he served as the team’s top recruiter.
In the spring of 2019, Colpoys volunteered as an assistant for the NBA G League’s Erie Bayhawks, a team within the New Orleans Pelicans organization, where he assisted the coaching staff during practices and games. He also worked as a camp counselor at Penn State Behrend, an affiliated college of Penn State University, in addition to Michigan, Notre Dame and Lemoyne basketball camps for three summers since 2019.
Colpoys began his collegiate basketball career at Penn State, helping the Lions to a 42-14 record for two years while averaging 7.1 points, 2.6 assists and 2.6 rebounds. A late-season injury at the end of his sophomore season ended his playing career.
Colpoys joined the Lions coaching staff as a student assistant for his final two years as an undergraduate, and the team went on to a 44-13 season with a conference championship win and a NCAA First Round appearance.
“Matt will be an excellent addition to our staff,” Caputo said in the release. “Matt embodies a lot of the characteristics we are looking for to succeed in this position. He is smart, hardworking and has a tremendous passion for the game.”

Water polo extended its winning streak to six this weekend after sweeping the competition at the Princeton Invitational and capturing three conference awards this Tuesday.
The Colonials ousted Cal Lutheran, St. Francis Brooklyn and Iona in a dominant there-day stretch when they outscored their opponents by a margin of 41–30. In an overwhelming series of honors, graduate student center Theodoros Pateros was named Mid-Atlantic Water Polo Conference Player of the Week for the second straight time, junior goalkeeper Luca Castorina earned Defensive Player of the Week and graduate student utility player Mateus Stellet became Rookie of the Week for their roles in GW’s recent success.
In the three games, the Colonials topped Cal Lutheran 12–8, beat St. Francis Brooklyn after a 14–13 shootout and dominated Iona by a score of 15–9. Pateros led the charge for GW by scoring 15 goals for the second weekend in a row, this time over the course of three games instead of four in Annapolis last week.
The Colonials have maintained a powerful offense through the season with a 6–1 record as they seek to win their third consecutive MAWPC Championship.
Here is a recap of the Princeton Invitational:
Game 1:
The Colonials began their victorious weekend against one of the better Division III teams in the nation in the No. 3 Cal Lutheran Kingsmen in a 12–8 shootout on Friday.
The match started with an early tie with three goals apiece by the middle of the second quarter. The Colonials netted five straight goals from there, which put them on top 7–4 in their first lead of the afternoon heading into the break. Pateros led the team with six goals, allowing the Colonials to maintain the upper-hand in the pool.
Castorina also played an integral role in the Colonial’s defense, notching a season-high 20 saves and keeping the Kingsmen at bay through the second half while GW hung on to its three-goal lead.
The Kingsmen tried to strike back at the Colonials with four more goals but were unable to keep up with the GW offensive lineup, which netted three more before the end of the fourth quarter to solidify the first win of the weekend.
Game 2:
GW continued into Game 2 with their first ranked win of the year in a thriller over the St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers Saturday. The game went into overtime before GW broke a tie and scored two goals to grab the victory.
Both teams went back and forth in scoring, staying within two points of each other for the majority of the game. The Colonials reached an 8–6 lead before the Terriers evened the score heading into halftime.
Senior utility player Antonin Kralj tied the game for GW at nine with just nine seconds remaining in the fourth quarter in his career-high fifth goal of the game.
The back-and-forth exchange of goals continued into overtime, but Pateros would not let up for the GW team. He scored four goals, edging GW to a 13–12 lead as time expired, marking his fifth consecutive game with at least four goals.
Kralj assured the victory for the Colonials with a final goal during overtime that settled the match.
Game 3:
The Colonials beat the Iona Gaels 15–9, finishing the weekend with their sixth straight win.
GW trailed 4–3 in the final minutes of the second quarter when Pateros scored back-to-back goals to send the Colonials into the break, up 5–4. GW pulled a 10-goal run in the third quarter that secured the weekend sweep.
In the fourth quarter, Iona hit a 10–8 run that challenged the Colonials, but GW scored five goals within five minutes that crowned them the winners of the weekend.
The Colonials will head to the Collegiate Water Polo Association Crossover Weekend Tournament Saturday. Tipoff is set for 9 a.m.

Metropolitan Police Department officers are investigating the death of a student in Guthridge Hall after receiving a report of an unconscious student Tuesday morning.
MPD officers responded to a report of an unconscious student in Guthridge Hall at 11:36 a.m. before launching the death investigation, MPD spokespeople told The Hatchet. Interim University President Mark Wrighton and Dean of Students Colette Coleman confirmed the student’s death and offered condolences to the student’s family and friends in an email to the University community Tuesday night.
Wrighton and Coleman provided information regarding the University’s mental health resources and said Division for Student Affairs staff members are providing assistance to people “closely affected” by the student’s death. They said additional on-call counseling services are available by calling 877-841-1080.
“The loss of one of our own will be felt by many across our GW community,” Wrighton and Coleman said in the email. “At this difficult time, please come together and continue to support and take care of one another.”
A doctor pronounced the student dead at 11:53 a.m., according to a report sent by an MPD spokesperson.
Personnel with MPD and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner were seen exiting Guthridge Hall carrying what appeared to be a covered body on a stretcher at 2:17 p.m., nearly 40 minutes after OCME arrived outside the building. One of three OCME vehicles stationed along F Street transported the stretcher away from the scene.
Rod Adams, the general counsel of OCME, confirmed in a statement Wednesday that OCME officials responded to the scene of the death.
University spokesperson Tim Pierce said in a statement at about 1 p.m. that GW officials became aware of reports of police activity around Guthridge Hall and were coordinating with MPD.
“There is no immediate risk to the University community,” Pierce said at the time. “We will provide updates as they are available.”
Vito Maggiolo, a spokesperson for D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services, said FEMS dispatched responders at 11:36 a.m. to a call reporting a “possible obvious death” on the 2100 block of F Street. Maggiolo said EMeRG was on scene when FEMS responders arrived.
An MPD officer from the department’s homicide branch was seen meeting GW Police Department Chief James Tate and another GWPD officer at 1:17 p.m. before entering the residence hall. Tate declined to comment on the case.
