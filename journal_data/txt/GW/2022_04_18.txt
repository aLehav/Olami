Officials said they announced Whole Foods' decision to phase out a year early since its proximity to campus makes it an "integral" component of students' meal planning.
Updated: April 21, 2022 at 11:22 a.m.
Dining officials announced the I Street Whole Foods will no longer accept GWorld as a form of payment beginning in June 2023.
Officials said in an email to on-campus residents Tuesday that Whole Foods made a “corporate decision” to phase out its participation in university dining plans across the country. Dining officials said they announced Whole Foods’ decision to phase out a year early because the grocery store’s close proximity to campus makes it an “integral” component of students’ meal planning.
“We want to stress that this is not an individual store decision, and is not related to our new residential focused dining program,” the email states.
Officials said the Safeway on Wisconsin Avenue – the other grocery store near campus that accepts GWorld – will continue to accept GWorld payments for the foreseeable future. Officials have no updates on other new or outgoing GWorld partners, according to the email.
Another nearby grocery store, Trader Joe’s, has not accepted GWorld as payment since 2007.
University Dining announced last August that they would be unveiling a new dining plan for the 2022-2023 academic year, which includes the construction of three all-you-can-eat dining halls in District House and Thurston and Shenkman halls. Officials announced the District House dining hall will “later” during the next school year despite initial plans to open the hall at the start of the fall semester. 
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the District House dining hall would open during the fall semester. Officials said the dining hall will open “later” during the next school year. We regret this error.

Freeman became the first GW rookie since the 2003-04 season to rack up at least 100 assists in one season. 
Freshman guard Brayon Freeman told reporters Saturday that he committed to Rhode Island for the 2022-23 season, according to a tweet by ESPN recruitment analyst and basketball insider Adam Finkelstein.
Freeman announced his intent to transfer on March 22, coinciding with senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr.’s announcement. The decision marks the second commitment this week after sophomore guard Joe Bamisile announced his commitment to Oklahoma on Wednesday.
“I will develop in a good way, definitely,” Freeman said in an interview Tuesday. “They love basketball there, and they love the basketball culture so the basketball environment is constantly developing.”
Freeman said there was no specific reason he left GW but he was looking for coaches he could rely on for his next season. He said he would miss being close to his family and having them attend his games but sees this opportunity as a way to continue developing his game.
Freeman, a three-star recruit and one of the top 30 point guards during his signing, averaged a .433 shooting percentage in just his first season. He was named to the All-Rookie squad after rounding out his debut campaign with an average of 10 points per game, 3.6 assists and 1.3 steals per game.
Freeman became the first GW rookie since the 2003-04 season to contribute at least 100 assists in one season, a title that previously belonged to 2006 graduate Carl Elliot. Freeman ranked in the top 15 A-10 rookies overall in the league and second in the assists and assist-to-turnover ratio.
Freeman set an 18-point ascension with seven assists during the A-10 Tournament where the team achieved their highest seed in five years as the seventh seed before bowing out in the second round against Massachusetts.
“They made me feel like family when I went on my visit and I really liked the campus,” Freeman said.

One year into my political science major at GW, I started to wonder whether it was for me. I found the coursework interesting yet impractical – heavy on theory, light on real-world usefulness. Most class discussions ended up getting derailed by the news of the day, with the topic veering from democratic backsliding to the Democratic primary. It seemed to freshman-year Andrew like a basic or unoriginal course of study.
Now, approaching graduation and with the benefit of hindsight, I want to say some words in defense of the major whose utility I once questioned.
Students at GW seem to use the political science major less as an avenue for the intellectual pursuit of the theory and social science behind politics, and more as a vehicle for the experiences they have outside of the classroom – and that’s okay. It allows students who are interested in politics to complement their studies with real-world experience without having to spend every waking second juggling coursework in a way most other majors do not permit.
Now, that’s not to say everybody who majors in political science is in it just to check the box of studying something, coasting through classes and placing their real focus on what they’re doing outside of their courses. But there are plenty who do. My point is not to say that that’s bad, but that it’s actually a good thing.
Sure, the main point of college is to immerse yourself in a chosen course of study. The finger-wagging, focus-on-your-studies trope is one that most college students are familiar with, but also one that neglects the fact that there’s so much more to college than just what you learn in class. In fact, if all you do at GW is shuffle between your room, your classes and the library, you’re missing out.
Attending college, and especially attending GW, unlocks a whole world of new opportunities that are available uniquely to college students – securing Hillternships, interning for NGOs, working for advocacy groups, volunteering and so many more experiences unique to D.C. A lighter course load lets students have the flexibility to fill up the rest of their schedule with extracurricular activities on campus or with work off-campus – time that students might otherwise have spent in the library poring over textbooks.
GW clearly knows this, too – in fall 2020, the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences reduced the number of major-specific credits for a bachelor’s degree in political science from 57 to 33 – nearly halving the number of classes students had to take. Only requiring 11 nongeneral education classes for a major is incredibly low – for context, a major in political communication requires 19 classes, and a major in economics requires 14 classes. In fact, it is almost impossible to graduate with a degree in political science without adding on another major or receiving internship credit – GW requires 120 total credits to get a degree.
The fact that it is not even possible to just study political science on its own validates that the program is only one part of a well-rounded first step into politics and policy. Clearly, the University is doing something right, as are the thousands of students who have availed themselves of the unspoken compact of taking on a less rigorous courseload in exchange for garnering real-life experience in their intended field.
There was an extent to which I expected college to be a staid, bookish endeavor – not bifurcating my time between cracking the books and hopping on the Metro to go to a political rally with a student advocacy organization. All of this is why I was somewhat taken aback by the political science curriculum and political science students when I first got to GW. Once I realized that that was the whole point, the true value of the political science major became clear to me – and I’ll graduate with more knowledge under my belt as a result.

When the University lifted its mask mandate earlier this month, officials cited D.C.’s “low” COVID-19 designation and a lack of significant transmission or serious illness after spring break as their reasoning behind the decision. But neither of these facts had changed when GW reinstated the mandate last week.
While lifting the mask mandate was controversial, the University’s decision at the time faithfully reflected the changing science behind masking and the significant advancements made in combatting the pandemic. Reinstating the mask mandate is a confusing, ineffective measure that casts doubt on GW’s success in responding to COVID-19.
It is crucial to understand the importance of masking relative to vaccine availability when devising a COVID-19 response plan. Early in the pandemic during spring 2020, we relied on social distancing, quarantining and masks to minimize coronavirus infection. Medical research shows masks slowed the spread of COVID-19, reduced the wearer’s exposure to the virus and even reduced infection severity. More importantly, we now have access to three authorized vaccines in the United States with more on the way. Masking and social distancing are mitigation strategies, but vaccines are our primary and most effective intervention. Simply put, our toolkit for fighting this pandemic could not be more different than two years ago.
The University justified the reinstated mask mandate with rising cases, but public health experts have said case positivity is a less helpful metric for assessing risk in highly vaccinated communities. In an April 2021 article for The Washington Post, three public health experts argued that a combination of low hospitalization rates and high vaccination rates are effective measurements that public health officials can use to decide when to ease interventions like masking. Since the vaccine is effective, case positivity is increasingly less correlated with death and hospitalization. In other words, while more people are contracting the coronavirus, their vaccinated status reduces the chance of hospitalization or death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses both hospitalizations and vaccination rates in its newest recommendations to assess community risk, not rising cases alone.
Continuing to follow the same measures that were in place before widespread vaccination ignores the vaccine’s incredible protection against transmission and serious infection. Roughly 98 percent of GW’s community and nearly 75 percent of the District’s residents are fully vaccinated. A study by the Peterson Center on Healthcare and Kaiser Family Foundation found fully vaccinated people ages 18-49 represented only 10 percent of all vaccinated Americans admitted to hospitals for severe COVID-19 cases between June and September 2021. For University community members who don’t fall into that age range, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines reduced the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization by 94 percent.
Masking needed to be universal before widespread vaccination because the virus was highly transmissible and threatened the population’s personal health and safety. That threat was especially high for those who are 65 years and older or have comorbid conditions or compromised immune systems. But viral infection and severity is now largely dependent on vaccination status. The most likely form of viral transmission is from unvaccinated people to other unvaccinated people, and the least likely is transmission between those who are vaccinated. Vaccinated people are 29 times less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than unvaccinated people.
Because vaccination increases protection from COVID-19, public health experts have embraced one-way masking, or choosing whether to wear a mask based on individual preference, with an N95 mask. N95 masks can block upward of 90 percent of COVID-19 particles, offering more protection than universal cloth or surgical masking. In a highly vaccinated community, one-way masking offers incredible protection from the virus for those still concerned about their health without a mask mandate. When the University reinstated its mandate, officials encouraged GW community members to use an N95 mask over cloth or surgical masks.
Mask mandates are not the only way to protect those at risk from COVID-19 nor are they the most effective means to do so. Having more options to attend classes remotely or in a hybrid format would allow those concerned about in-person classes during the pandemic to learn in comfort. Enacting lenient and forgiving attendance policies would prevent students from choosing between sitting through class while sick or tending to their health. Distributing the University’s rapid home testing kits beyond the Virginia Science and Technology Campus would make testing more accessible and would better measure positivity. Reporting hospitalizations on campus would also help those who are immunocompromised to decide whether it is safe for them to be on campus with or without a mask. All of these measures would better respond to the pandemic than a mask mandate.
Current scientific research does not support requiring all individuals to wear a mask independent of vaccination status, immunity or risk. That same research suggests that vaccinated people in highly vaccinated communities who are comfortable unmasking should feel empowered to do so without worrying that they pose an undue threat to others who are vaccinated.
The University damaged its credibility when it chose to ignore how far we have come in responding to this pandemic when it reinstated its mandate. GW’s decision to reinstate a universal mask mandate implies that it lacks confidence in the vaccine, and suspending the mask mandate again would jeopardize the University’s credibility further. The reinstatement of the mandate is a confusing, confidence-damaging policy of questionable efficacy for managing the threat the pandemic poses.

Thompson said he struggled to find the right balance between schoolwork and golf to keep a clear mind during tournaments. 
When graduate student Clifford Thompson completed his flight from Broederstroom, South Africa and arrived at GW as the golf team’s only international student in 2017, he was on edge.
To his relief, he received an outpouring of support from his teammates to welcome him to the team upon his arrival. He said before coming to GW, a majority of the team members called him to see how he was feeling with his new transition to the United States and offer support.
“I was nervous as a whole coming to America for the first time,” Thompson. “I never visited, nothing, and I had these guys reach out to me, asked me how I’m doing, what’s up, asking me questions, trying to call me.”
Over the course of two seasons during his freshman and sophomore years, Thompson led the team to its first Atlantic 10 Tournament win in more than 13 years in 2019 and a second NCAA Tournament title a few months later. During his sophomore year, he averaged a 77.4 score finishing T-13th at the Patriot Intercollegiate tournament and garnering a top-30 finish at the Bash at the Beach tournament.
Thompson said his time with GW had been marked by both successes and struggles as an injury during his junior year affected his play in the conference season. He said he worked “really hard” that summer to overcome his injury, marking his proudest moment in the program.
“I guess the main thing is bigger odds, and we play our best for each other, more than anything else,” Thompson said. “And I’ve noticed that each and every one of us, every time we play poorly, we don’t feel bad for ourselves. We feel bad for the team as a whole.”
Thompson said he had to adapt to a more open environment where he needed to be vocal in his classes and adapt to college-level professors as an international student. He said he struggled to find the perfect balance between schoolwork and golf to keep a clear mind during tournaments to concentrate on his play.
“Pretty much understanding what the professor wants and being more vocal in class – back home in South Africa, if you just did your homework and did well on your tests, you’re perfectly fine,” he said.
Thompson said maintaining a familial environment between players has been crucial to the program’s success. He said the team’s support system made him excited to come to GW and not worry about the unknown when he first arrived in the United States.
Thompson said he was very grateful for Head Coach Chuck Scheinost’s support during his time at GW as he gave him the opportunity to come to GW.
“Thanks, Chuck, for giving me the opportunity – that’s the biggest thing for me,” Thompson said. “I got to study at an unbelievable university, and I’m forever in his debt for that.”
Scheinost said the team gave Thompson the nickname “Clifford the Dog” after his arrival due to his fun-loving nature with the team. He said Thompson was an “asset” to the team because he always made the most of the opportunities at GW and always looked out for the team.
“He’s kind of been one of those guys that was a little bit of the glue, the fun-loving guy that everyone could always turn to and talk to and always had the fun stories to tell,” Scheinost said. “And I think that really helped.”
He said Thompson had taken a leadership position on the team, where he helped create a family atmosphere that was lost during the pandemic when the team could no longer live together. Scheinost said Thompson and the other seniors helped the freshmen adjust to the team and set the tone of the team’s expectations for their next few years.
Scheinost said the injuries Thompson suffered throughout his time with the Colonials sidelined him after his junior year. Thompson is currently suffering from an injury that has kept him off the golf course.
“He started out well, and then the injuries kind of derailed him a little bit, so he’s progressed over the course of his time,” Schenoist said. “But it’s a little disappointing because we haven’t got to see Clifford and his full potential because of the injuries.” 
Scheinost said that during tournaments, Thompson played a key role in getting everyone fired up and ready to compete, which he will miss in the following years.
“He’s one of those special guys that comes along, and I think his legacy and character will live on for a long time in our program,” he said. “And that’s as much as scores and results are important, but those are things that live on, generally longer. And it’s the mark you make on people and how you change people’s lives.”

DiTomaso said his goal is for everyone on the team to play their best and to showcase the talent in their lineup. 
Powering the offense with a hot bat near the top of the lineup during his first two years at GW, junior shortstop Steve DiTomaso has emerged as a leader on the baseball team.
Since his first full season on the team returning from the pandemic last spring, DiTomaso has recorded a .346 batting average and a .408 sluggish percentage in his first two seasons with 62 hits and 42 runs. This spring alone, he leads the team with a .436 batting average, .436 on base percentage and is tied for sixth most hits in all of NCAA Division I baseball.
His consistency at the dish has turned heads at both the collegiate and professional levels. He picked up the Colonial of the Week honors this season back in March and was named to the 2022 Brooks Wallace Award watch list of top shortstops in the country.
“I hope to be someone that people can look to and basically be an example of who people want to work like,” he said. “And it’s not really about the results – it’s really about how you go put your best foot forward everyday and your full effort every day and the process of getting to the results.”
He said he was recruited as an outfielder out of high school, but after the onset of the pandemic cut his freshman season short, he moved to shortstop when four starters were injured in the 2021 season. DiTomaso, who hadn’t played shortstop since he was a kid, said he had to adjust to play the position at the college level for the first time but has enjoyed it so far.
“It was a great experience, it was a lot of fun,” he said. “And it’s been quite the ride so far, just to keep learning and getting better at shortstop.
In his first season at the position last spring, he earned second team All-Atlantic 10 and the All-Rookie team with a .349 batting average and .425 slugging percentage.
During the current spring season, DiTomaso has started 34 of the team’s 35 games all at shortstop and carries a .923 fielding percentage. He said this season has allowed him to full play at the A-10 level after the pandemic cut short his first two seasons at GW.
“We never got A-10 and then last year was a weird short situation with COVID-19,” DiTomaso said. “So I’m really just looking forward to playing a full season, getting a full experience of A-10 play and honestly getting closer with my team every day.”
DiTomaso said he puts his best effort forward and his teammates can look up to him. He said his goal is for everyone on the team to play their best and to showcase the talent in their lineup.
“And I think there’s a lot more room and a lot left that we can show,” he said. “So my biggest goal right now is just to get every single person on our team to be their absolute best and play the best baseball we can because I think it’ll surprise a lot of people and show everyone how good we actually are.”
DiTomaso said players on the team push each other to be better with friendly competitions within the team, like his dynamic with senior centerfielder Cade Fergus to see who can get more hits in each game. He said he would “love it” if Fergus tallied more hits each game because it helps fuel the team around him.
DiTomaso said he looks forward to playing a full season of conference games and making a run for the A-10 championship in May.
“It’s a lot of fun playing conference games and bettering each other, traveling’s so much fun,” he said. “Just hanging out with your team and getting a chance to win an A-10 championship is what I’m most excited for.”
Head coach Gregg Ritchie said DiTomaso was originally intended to be a backup at shortstop last spring but adapted to the role quickly and earned a permanent spot for the following seasons. He said DiTomaso’s calm character helps his consistency in each game and keeps him in tune with the coaches’ directions.
“He doesn’t play there, and we just throw him in there very first game of the year, and boom, he becomes second team All-Conference,” Ritchie said. “He’s growing at that spot too because he’s learning the position more.”
Ritchie said DiTomaso is the “epitome” of what a GW baseball player represents because he plays with the passion, honor and resilience necessary to motivate the team to work together.
“He has the ability to go from first gear, to second gear, to third gear, to overdrive in his manner of playing the game,” Ritchie said. “So he plays the game with such ferocity and intent that you know everything he does. Even when it’s not a high level performance day, he’s still a guy who is leading the team with his actions, his intensity, his energy. He’s just that engine that makes things run.”
DiTomaso will look to carry his momentum through the rest of the spring with 18 more games left on the regular season.

A University spokesperson declined to say how long officials intend to continue Wrighton’s interim contract with the University.
Officials have remained silent on the search for GW’s next permanent president despite previous expectations that the search would commence in “early spring.”
Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights said in September that the University would begin its search for a permanent president in “early spring,” but officials have declined to provide any updates about the process as the semester nears its close. The Board hired Mark Wrighton as interim University president for up to 18 months beginning this past January, a term that will end no later than next summer.
“At this time, there is no update to share about the presidential search process,” University spokesperson Tim Pierce said in an email. “The University will share information with the GW community about the presidential search in detail when that changes.”
Pierce declined to say how long officials intend to continue Wrighton’s contract with the University.
GW’s most recent search for a permanent president started after former University President Steven Knapp announced his departure in June 2016. Officials formed a 19-member committee made up of faculty, trustees, alumni, staff and a student representative nearly three weeks after announcing the start of the search.
Pierce also declined to say when the Board will create a formal search committee or when they will start accepting nominations for the position.
Months after Thomas LeBlanc announced his retirement as University president in May 2021, officials similarly remained quiet. Officials said days after they announced LeBlanc would be stepping down that trustees were discussing the search but declined to provide further details about the process in the weeks leading up to Wrighton’s sudden hiring announcement.
Speights announced last September that trustees would hire Wrighton and postpone the presidential search, citing a need to first strengthen shared governance to place GW in the best position possible to attract presidential talent amid the large number of ongoing searches nationwide.
“My principal responsibility will be to prepare for my successor,” Wrighton said at a Faculty Senate meeting in January. “As you know, I’m appointed for a relatively short term as president, and I’m looking forward to preparing the University for recruitment of a truly outstanding academic leader.”
The Board is expected to vote on a shared governance framework next month after it received endorsements from the faculty senators and senior administrators, the product of the monthslong, consensus-building initiative.
Even with the framework now poised for final approval, the group spearheading its development has found remaining divisions over who should lead the presidential search.
A survey of full-time faculty, administrators and trustees released in March found that the majority of faculty and administrators said the three groups should take a joint lead in picking a new president. But almost 90 percent of trustees said the Board should have control over the selection process.
Faculty leaders had expressed concerns during the previous presidential search that the Board’s search committee did not represent the University.
The shared governance framework does not directly mention the presidential search but instead establishes a set of principles to be used in major decision-making.
“The one thing I can say about the search process is that it will be very inclusive,” Speights said in an interview in September. “There will be representation from all constituents. We will focus on diversity, and we will focus on inclusion.”
The Faculty Assembly approved a 17-member faculty consultative committee in October to advise trustees during the search process, a move in line with past searches.
In the search that ended in LeBlanc’s hiring, trustees engaged search firm Isaacson, Miller to help create a list of candidates and advise officials on who should fill the position. Officials declined to say whether they have hired an outside search firm to assist in the presidential search, and Isaacson, Miller did not return a request for comment.
The Board also typically releases a presidential profile once the search is underway to explain the qualifications that officials are looking for in candidates.
The website that officials have historically used to publish updates and information about presidential searches is currently inaccessible and is listed as “under maintenance” as of Sunday.
In the most recent search, officials garnered more than 100 nominations for the University presidency from community members. In January 2017, the University announced LeBlanc would arrive at GW that August, ending a seven-month search process.

The app will serve as a platform for independent artists to promote their music without signing with a record label. 
Student-led music groups are conjuring up new avenues to help underground artists receive recognition and build community.
A group of four seniors is working to launch an app called Put Me On, a social media and music streaming platform for independent artists to promote their work without a label company partnership. The seniors have been developing the app since fall 2020, and the platform is currently in a limited release for beta testing before its full launch, which does not have a set release date yet.
The founders said music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music neglect musicians in the making, leaving space for untapped potential to give them an accessible platform. The team said unlike other streaming platforms, PMO will offer creative ways to construct videos with snippets of songs and allow for artists to transition from creating their media to streaming their sound.
“As a company, our real goal is to connect listeners and artists in the best way possible,” PMO co-founder and economics major Sam Linder said.
The team, who first met as roommates their freshman year, came up with the idea in 2020 during their junior year. Before developing any of the media, the group decided in August 2020 to rent a house to live together in Atlanta – where some of the founders are from – and connect with other artists in the city they refer to as the “Mecca of music.”
Linder said the group was looking to make a platform more suitable and distinctive for the current market, one that “fit into a niche market that hasn’t been touched yet.”
“It developed into ‘How can we make it a platform that’s easy for artists to share their work and their music and for listeners to easily find it in a super engaging way,’” PMO co-founder Jayden Bourne said.
The team came up with the idea when senior sociology major and PMO’s Chief Innovation Officer Khari Crooms found himself on his porch one day, sharing music in a group chat with his friends, who would soon become his co-founders. Scrolling through the visuals of the text thread, Crooms thought about creating a new social platform with a fast exchange of musical ideas.
Crooms said he thinks of the platform as a communal service in which artists share their work with others who possess the same passion for creating music. The co-founders said the artists will be able to record their sound and upload it directly to the site, allowing them to take ownership of their art and “capitalize” on their creativity.
“They also have a space in which they can share and celebrate each other,” Crooms said. “I think there’s power in that, and that builds community.”
Alongside 13 other innovative groups, the team won the 2021 New Venture Competition, the largest collegiate competition in the country hosted at GW and open to students working on entrepreneurial ventures with a social and technological focus.
The founders said they helped organize a Day of the Arts festival last Sunday in Square 80, where artists – ranging from musicians like Head Case Band to the founders’ Atlanta-based musician connections – could come together and bring untapped artists “out of the woodwork.” Linder said the festival was a “culmination” of the various types of expertise they have interacted with across major cities, which brought a newfound appreciation for music on campus.
The founders said they dedicated a year of planning to the event, which drew about 500 attendees throughout the day and ultimately included interactive pop-ups, student artwork and tabling from organizations like POP! Clothing and Sunrise GW.
Platform-user Zidane Dixon, who releases music under the name iCEYDONi, said PMO is helping independent artists get their music recognized throughout the world without feeling the need to deliver a certain number of albums on a deadline with a record deal.
Dixon, who attended the festival, said the event showcased the substantive support group PMO has effectively gathered, offering “versatility” onstage across the various performances.
He said he started using the app’s beta version in 2020, which he found connected artists to resources for their craft through marketing promos, constructive criticism and potential financial assistance.
He said by prioritizing student creativity on a larger scale to share with the public, PMO has inspired his work ethic, leaving him eager to stay engaged with the platform and utilize the connections he has been searching for as an underground artist.
“The creative control – I think that’s what the main thing to grab for it [is] for independent artists,” Dixon said.
Wyatt Kirschner, a co-president of the Student Music Coalition, said he was approached by the PMO team after finishing a Halloween show featuring student musicians at the National Pan-Hellenic Council house on Townhouse Row when the co-founders asked to collaborate to plan a student music festival. He said he already knew Linder and Crooms as fellow music-makers on campus and quickly helped to organize the festival for a couple of months.
Kirschner said as a student organization on campus, SMC oversaw official budget allocation for the Day of the Arts festival from the Student Association – eventually receiving a sum of $12,695 – which they used to hire sound technicians. He said from the crowd the sound was “professional,” with loud volumes that felt like a concert.
As a member of a band himself, Kirschner performed at the festival with his upstate New York-based band Citrus Maxima, where he plays as the guitarist.
“It’s just really cool to see some of my friends and other musicians that I really love and I know have a lot of passion for what they do, like perform or sell their art,” he said.
PMO and SMC are working to create a music scene at GW that brings an array of creators together outside of the classroom space.
“I think music in particular is an interest that can really bond people, forge friendships,” Kirschner said.
