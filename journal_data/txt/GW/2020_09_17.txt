I received an email from the Pre-Law Student Association earlier this month announcing that officials had terminated the University’s only pre-law adviser position. That person was crucial to working toward any law school acceptance. 
The pre-law adviser was responsible for reviewing students’ law school applications, organizing law school fairs, hosting informational sessions, helping students navigate law school financing and advising GW Mock Trial. Removing her position directly comes at the expense of students interested in pursuing a career in law, who now have no GW resource to help them navigate their application process. 
But the layoff didn’t happen in a vacuum. While her immediate removal can be traced to the financial implications of the pandemic, the terminated position represents a symptom of a long and dysfunctional trend in higher education – one characterized by administrative bloat and the increasingly blurred lines between economic markets and higher education.
As students and faculty alike have suggested, not only should University President Thomas LeBlanc resign just as a means of recognizing his complete indifference to and abandonment of GW’s academic values, but administrators should also work toward reorganizing their priorities and restructuring themselves. Officials must give financial decision-making power to faculty, reinstate faculty autonomy of administrative decision making and prioritize job security.
The structure of the modern university can be traced back to World War II. While the Depression had left higher education institutions in desperate financial need, the war marked a drastic change in the structure of higher education as the government invested more than $300 million for war-related projects. Following the war, large increases in student enrollment and government-funded research contributed to the growth, power and size of university bureaucracies. The primary mission of these bureaucracies was to mobilize university resources to serve the interests of their funding sources: business and the armed forces. 
By the 1980s, teaching and research itself had been reformed to accommodate the needs of the private sector and remain competitive with other universities. Knowledge became much more valuable because it was able to be bought and sold and traded in global markets. Universities have also responded to the pressure to be profitable through market activities, like becoming intricately involved in finance and real-estate development. GW reflects this perfectly, having owned more than $428 million in taxable property while investing more than $1.03 billion in 2019 alone.   
This transformation in higher education has cultivated novel forms of knowledge that help academics, the government and private businesses make more money. Unfortunately, this transformation undermined academic institutions’ capacity to generate positive knowledge, much less critical thought.
As universities changed, faculty autonomy and governance became increasingly restricted. The primary goal of administrative institutions shifted to pursue new sources of revenue, while shared governance and faculty opposition stand counter to that goal. This being the case, universities hired individuals that are more directly responsible for revenue generation, like those in administrative roles. 
These revenue goals often justified the hiring of faculty not protected by tenure, who are less likely to outwardly oppose unjust administrative decisions because of their job insecurity. It is estimated that adjunct or untenured faculty make up to 75 percent of instructors. In contrast, universities dramatically expanded the number of administrators while boosting administrative salaries, especially those of university presidents, like Thomas LeBlanc who makes roughly $800 thousand or GW administrator Shahram Sarkani, who made about $1 million in 2016.
The growth of administrative bloat accompanies the process of “academic prioritization” that aims to convert low revenue-generating disciplines, like social sciences and humanities, into market-oriented disciplines, like STEM. When budget cuts need to be made, non-tenured faculty, social studies and humanities departments are the first to go because such cuts are essential in redirecting revenue toward majors and services that have potential for market growth. 
It’s this grossly inequitable trend of higher education, one that favors inflated administrative salaries, useless bureaucratic positions and bending to the will of the market, that has led to the pre-law adviser’s termination. And it’s not just the adviser, of course. More than 70 workers have been laid off since this summer, and the number will only continue to rise amid flawed administrative decisions in an already structurally unsound higher education system. 
The University needs to reinstate the position of the pre-law adviser, but they can’t stop there. They have to work toward fixing the root cause of why she was let go – and while blaming finances is the easy way out, it ignores a long, complicated history of structural mismanagement and undermining of traditional academic prioritization.

The pandemic has thrown unfavorable – and unpredictable – situations at us each day. Many students and their families are facing financial strain while they embark on online classes, causing a sharp increase in depression and anxiety levels. 
You could say you’ll go for a walk or put on a face mask to wind down to deal with stress. But taking care of your mental health isn’t necessarily the same thing as self-care. If you think you need more than a walk or warm bath to deal with your overall wellbeing, you probably do.
If you caught a cold, you would probably take care of it by taking NyQuil or a nap. If you broke your arm, you would probably have to get a cast and rest your arm until it’s healed. Feelings of depression and anxiety are no different than catching a cold or breaking your arm. The only difference is how we think we need to treat them. Mental health is just as serious as your physical health and needs to be taken care of accordingly. Students must take care of their mental health and use GW-provided and online resources to cope with the semester ahead. 
As someone who has struggled with a serious mental illness my whole life, it frustrates me when people seem to think they can solve their issues by putting on a face mask or “taking it easy.” I’ve seen countless Instagram posts telling people to take care of themselves by taking a walk, long bath or meditating. While looking after yourself is crucial to taking care of your mental health, there is no shame in admitting that what you’re going through right now cannot be dealt with alone. Whether that means getting professional help or relying on a trusted friend or family member, there is no shame in reaching out when they are struggling. 
Students could start finding help by reaching out to a close family member or friend. But for your mental health needs to be consistently addressed and heard, it’s best to find therapy or psychiatric help. There are even different types of therapy and therapists who can specifically help you work through what you need. You might not find someone you like right away, but stick with the process and they can help you find coping mechanisms to deal with feelings like depression and anxiety. 
GW also provides resources to help students mentally struggling. The University offers counseling via telemedicine during the pandemic, and workers in the Colonial Health Center can refer you to outside therapists who can cater to your specific needs. You can download a GW-sponsored app that helps you track your mental health and read information about dealing with feelings of depression on the CHC website. 
At the end of the day, the way you deal with your mental health is up to you. But mental health is just as important as physical health and must be treated as such. Our world is in turmoil, many of us are back in our childhood homes instead of at school and the nation is being gripped by a pandemic and national protests. Dealing with yourself is in your control during this chaos – if you are struggling and are unsure of where to go, there is always help available.

Levain Bakery's cookies balance sweetness and flavor – but they'll only be available for another month.
For nearly 25 years, Levain Bakery has been a New York City staple that’s known for its massive 6-ounce cookies. But now you can find the famous cookies just minutes from campus.
Located at 3131 M St. NW in Georgetown, the D.C. shop is the bakery’s first venture outside of New York. The cookies’ cult following in New York followed to the District, drawing blocks-long lines at the Georgetown opening Wednesday.
Along with cookies, Levain Bakery offers classic baked goods like baguettes ($3), blueberry muffins ($2.95) and walnut sticky buns ($4.50).
You can also sip on several espresso drinks like lattes ($3.50), mochas ($4.25) or macchiatos ($2.75). If you’re not a fan of caffeine, you can opt for a hot chocolate ($4) made with Valrhona chocolate, a luxury chocolate from France.
The cookies ($4) are the main event, coming in five flavors – chocolate chip walnut, dark chocolate chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, dark chocolate peanut butter chip and two chip chocolate chip. Levain Bakery offers a gluten-free version of its chocolate chip walnut cookie. And to celebrate the opening of its D.C. location, you can try a limited-edition café con leche cookie.

D.C. is Levain Bakery’s first venture outside New York City.
The newest flavor is only available at the Georgetown location and was developed in collaboration with D.C. pastry chef Paola Velez. The chef is a co-founder of Bakers Against Racism – which raised nearly $1,900,000 throughout the summer for several social justice organizations – and the pastry chef at Maydan, a Middle Eastern restaurant in D.C.
For the month that it’s available, proceeds from the café con leche cookie will be donated to Horton’s Kids, a D.C. organization that aims to help children from under-resourced communities in D.C. graduate from high school and prepare for college.
I’ve already tried the other flavors in New York, so I knew I had to get the café con leche cookie. The giant cookie, which was practically the size of my palm, is made with the bakery’s signature dark chocolate cookie dough along with espresso and cinnamon.
Cookies are typically served fresh throughout the day, creating a gooey and warm interiors. I held onto my cookie for a bit before eating it, warming it up in the oven at 350 degrees for the same gooey texture.
The cookie’s Valrhona chocolate and dulce chips oozed out from being warmed up, bringing out the soft and melty flavors Levain Bakery is so well known for. Despite the gooey inside, the cookie maintained a somewhat crisp exterior, allowing me to drip them into a cold glass of oat milk.
Even though the cookie features chocolate dough and two types of chocolate, I somehow didn’t find it overwhelmingly sweet. The crunchy cashews and hints of espresso and cinnamon balanced the cookie’s sweetness more successfully than I expected. Plus, the sprinkle of sea salt atop was a welcome salty surprise that curbed the more sugary aspects of the cookie.
Levain Bakery’s new café con leche cookie is worth the hype and warrants a trip – or even two – to Georgetown before it leaves the menu next month.
