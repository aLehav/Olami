Men's golf head coach Chuck Scheinost talks with the team during practice at the Country Club of Woodmore. Scheinost is trying to build the team back into the Atlantic 10 champion that it was two years ago.  
Two seasons ago, the men’s golf team won the Atlantic 10 Championship, and was on its way to Greensboro, N.C. for NCAA regional competition. A year later, GW failed to finish in the top three of any tournament, and fell back to a sixth place finish at the A-10 Championship.
Just like that, it was time for a change. Out was five-year head coach Terry Shaffer, and in came former Northern Colorado head coach Chuck Scheinost.
In his first few months at GW, Scheinost has flipped the program upside down, instituting a much more rigorous and structured schedule, in hopes of getting the Colonials back to their A-10 Championship level.
“I think in the past they used to just show up and go play golf. They have to earn their way to the range, which is where they want to spend most of their time,” Scheinost said.
It’s not a complicated formula, Scheinost said, the team just has to “earn their way through the most important areas of golf,” like putting, chipping and wedge play.
For six years, Scheinost led the golf program at Northern Colorado, where he felt comfortable in an underfunded, yet successful program that boasted eight America Sky All-Conference selections and the 2010 League Player of the Year.
UNC was also where Scheinost met his coaching mentor, former Stanford head coach Wally Goodwin, who led the Cardinal to the 1994 National Championship, and watched the likes of Notah Begay, Casey Martin and Tiger Woods pass through his program.
“[Goodwin] always told me that there are three areas of college. You could be good at two of three areas: academic, athletic and social life,” Scheinost said. “Go recruit at the guys you want to be around that are great at the academic and athletic part, and that don’t necessarily want that social component as their main focus, and you’ll have success.”
His first coaching job was as an assistant for the men’s and women’s programs at Lenoir-Rhyne College in North Carolina, where he built his ties to come back to the East Coast.
A few of his friends from this original position let him know that a coaching position was vacant at GW, Scheinost said. At first glance, he saw a recently fully funded program in the nation’s capital, with local golf courses, a new Nike sponsorship, and strong academics – all of which could readily help him recruit.
Scheinost will spend plenty of time recruiting over the next year, as all of the players on the current roster, including the freshmen, were recruited by Schaffer.
Thus, Scheinost has had to win over each one of his players, and despite the slow start to the fall season – 13th and last place finishes in the team’s first two events – they are starting to buy into the system.
“This is his full-time career, his full-time passion is to be a golf coach, and he loves doing it. His mentor was Tiger’s old coach at Stanford, so he knows a lot about the game. So I really trust him and what he does, and I think he’ll take us in the right direction,” senior Graham Lawyer said.
The biggest change for the team so far this season has been Scheinost’s dedication to the short game, which will help his players drop two shots from their scores, he said.
During a team practice this week, a playful wager was proposed. Scheinost asked junior Jack Persons if he had made any chip shots yet during practice. After Persons replied that he had not, Scheinost bet that he could make more shots with an 8-iron in just one minute. He grabbed an 8-iron from one of his players’ set of clubs and started chipping away, just missing his first two shots.
He stepped back, returned the club and went back to coaching, while his players continuing to chip in seven shots with two different clubs as the second part of the day’s practice.
It’s simple drills like that, Scheinost believes, that will bring the competitive drive and structure necessary to be successful across an entire season.
“I think we peaked at the right time my freshman year,” Persons said, referring to the year the team won the A-10 Championship. “And it may not have happened, but it did happen. The rigor and the intensity we have now gives us a much better chance of just kind of more plateauing and playing well all season, instead of finding a stroke of luck.
As much as the first-year coach likes to win – something he knows can’t happen overnight – he understands the necessity to have a good time, and most importantly, make sure his players learn more from the game than just golf.
“It’s a constant battle. We want our guys to be successful in whatever they go into. A lot of times the stuff we do in our program is nothing more than your employer will ask for you when you graduate: show up on time, work hard, bring a competitive nature,” Scheinost said.

Student organizations are an essential part of the college experience. They define who we are, and give us a place where we can share mutual passions, interests and ideas.
But last week, Associate Dean of Students Tim Miller announced that because there are nearly 500 student organizations on campus, the Center for Student Engagement will enforce stricter rules with new groups.
Prospective groups are encouraged to demonstrate that they have a unique purpose at GW and that their mission can last at least four years. If they cannot prove this, Miller told The Hatchet, they will have to join existing groups, making it more difficult for some new groups to form on campus.
It isn’t the CSE’s role to control the growth of new organizations and determine which groups should be able to exist. By hindering the rise of new groups, the CSE has decided to stifle GW’s student life – which builds the sense of community our campus so desperately needs.
The Student Association – which is in charge of allocating annual funding for student organizations – has already accounted for the increasing number of student organizations. Last year, the SA passed a resolution mandating that incoming students pay slightly more each year to add to the student group funding pool.
And beginning last year, the SA asked all organizations to submit their planned expenses in the spring as opposed to the fall, giving the finance committee more time to plan funding in advance.
Miller does have a point. It’s important that our campus isn’t overwhelmed by student organizations with similar missions.
But student leaders are already cognizant of the growing number of groups. And instead of attempting to stifle them, they’ve put plans in place to make the funding process as effective as it possibly can be.
The SA does not evaluate funding for organizations based on how they compare to similar campus groups, SA Finance Chair Ryan Counihan said. In fact, the SA bylaws prohibit them from doing so.
The rise in the number of student groups is something Counihan has already thought about.
“While the Finance Committee has been forced to cope with the rise, and it has put a strain on our budget, this has not yet drastically taken resources away from existing student orgs,” he said in an email.
Counihan mentioned that down the road, if the number of student organizations continues to grow at an exorbitant rate, it might force the SA to redistribute money from current organizations to fund new organizations.
But because the SA has already taken precautions, it’s unnecessary for the CSE to get involved. In their well-intentioned attempts to be proactive, they’re actually being inhibitive.
Just because some student groups overlap doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t all exist. For example, many theatre groups at GW may share similar purposes, but by having multiple groups, they are able to maintain their distinct identities and continue to put on more shows. The CSE should allow the SA to allocate the money based on these plans instead of trying to prevent new groups from forming.
Miller told The Hatchet that down the road, having enough advisors for these groups could be a problem. But when it comes to student organizations, which are essential for an engaged student body, hiring more advisors is a cost worth footing.
The expansion of student life is essential for GW because it allows students to express themselves in new ways. As new generations of students attend GW, they should have the ability to form new groups that fit their individual interests, which might not always exist at GW. By limiting new groups from forming, the CSE hinders the ability for students to create and participate in groups that closely match their interests.
It’d be a better idea for the CSE to direct its attention elsewhere.

The cast of the Ford’s Theatre production of “The Laramie Project,” directed by Matthew Gardiner.  
A ring of chairs encircles a man holding a sign printed with the words, “Matt in Hell,” over a photo of a young man’s face.
The man is Fred Phelps, the head of the Westboro Baptist Church, who is protesting at the funeral of Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in Laramie, Wyo. in 1998. Friends of the victim dress as angels and silently stand around Phelps, blocking funeral-goers from his venomous words.
This scene from “The Laramie Project,” running now through Oct. 27 as a part of The Lincoln Legacy Project, jumps back to 1998, to the events immediately following the brutal beating and murder of Shepard, a young gay man studying at the University of Wyoming.
The two-and-a-half hour show has the eight cast members playing multiple roles, quickly changing small parts of their costumes, mannerisms and voices to distinguish from one character to the next.
“I have eight or nine characters. But, when you really break it down, each of us has at least one or two characters that are really developed throughout the show,” Paul Scanlan, a cast member, said. “All of us play these little sound bite characters, but then we all have these characters that really take a journey throughout the show.”
A college student is denoted by the simple addition of a backwards baseball cap, while a sheriff’s costume is distinct due simply to his jacket. When each character speaks, you feel as if he is simply speaking directly to you, not as if he is playing a part on stage.
This intimacy resonated with the audience, as members cried during a scene where Matthew’s father, Dennis Shepard, spoke directly to one of his son’s murderers in court and requested that the jury not sentence him to the death penalty.
Cast member Kimberly Gilbert said she wished tragic events like those that transpired in Laramie were no longer an issue in our world.
“The tragedy is that we still need this show. I wish this could be a period piece, but it’s not,” said Gilbert. The Tectonic Theatre Project, who wrote “Laramie,” “went back to Wyoming and there are university students there right now who have no idea who Mathew Shepard is, who have no idea what the story is about.”
Gilbert hopes that people do not forget Matthew’s story.
“It’s the human desire to sweep it under the rug, like it never happened, and move on. Doing this play again is saying, no, we have to remember.”
This month, on the 15th anniversary of his death, the production encourages audience members to contemplate and attempt to understand, as one character poignantly states, “the magnitude with which some people hate.”
The play has been coupled with a series of events meant to honor Shepard’s memory, including a candlelight vigil and a free exhibition, “Not Alone: The Power of Response,” featuring personal letters sent to the Shepard family after Matthew’s death.
Matthew’s mother, Judy Shepard, recently attended a production in honor of her son and sat on a discussion panel after the show, speaking with audience members about the tragedy. Her appearance was the first in a special Monday night discussion series set to run the length of the production.
Due to the the government shutdown, “The Laramie Project” will not take place in Ford’s Theatre as originally scheduled, as it is a National Historic Site, moving Tuesday’s performance to Woolly Mammoth Theatre. The series will continue Oct. 4 and Oct. 8 at First Congregational United Church of Christ. Tickets for these showings are free of cost and will be distributed on a first-come basis.

GW hoped it would make waves this fall when it established the law and society minor – the University’s first program geared toward undergraduates interested in going to law school. But I’m not surprised that only two students have enrolled so far.
Of course, there’s nothing wrong with studying the sociological analysis between legal institutions and the criminal justice system. In fact, you’ll probably learn a lot of interesting information. But if law school is the end goal, you won’t be prepared.
Believe it or not, if you want a leg up on your future legal education, pursuing an undergraduate degree in areas like computer science or engineering might actually be your best bet.
The law profession is changing. We’ve seen a boom in intellectual property litigation, specifically legal disputes over patents developed by pharmaceutical companies and tech firms.
GW offers an intellectual property and technology concentration in the law school, which focuses on patent law, internet regulation and even genetics. Nearly 60 of its 2,000 students are involved. The law school also has booming environmental law programs and an upstart health law center.
The students who can become experts in these areas will have a higher likelihood of getting a job after they graduate.
These types of law are in high demand, but students aren’t catching on en masse yet. That’s why hard science majors will have a leg up. Law professor Robert Brauneis, co-director of the intellectual property law program, told me that students with a technical degree who go to law school have a considerable advantage.
“There is a serious supply constraint,” he explained. “The number of people who get a technical degree and then get a law degree and then want to do patent work just isn’t that large.”
The high number of untapped employment opportunities in patent litigation almost guarantees those with the right background jobs after graduation. That’s a huge plus, especially as more and more law graduates find themselves without a place to work.
Less than half of GW Law School Class of 2012 graduates worked in full-time, salaried positions, according to a National Association for Law Placement survey released this fall. And this abysmal statistic has scared prospective students away: Law schools nationwide saw 30-year lows in the number of applicants last year.
So since the law field is changing so drastically, why aren’t students doing all that they can to compete?
“I think part of the explanation is that it is particularly difficult to have the skills and desire to both master a technical, quantitative subject and a subject that is highly verbal.” Brauneis notes.
He’s right: Law and computer sciences are vastly different fields. Many students who aspire to become lawyers might even be numbers-phobic.
Although every undergraduate fields of study will challenge students to think critically, the methods employed in law school curricula are nothing like an undergraduate education – no matter what you major in. But since the logical end to going to law school is getting a job, undergraduates should look to pursue courses of study that will make them the most competitive.
Law school admissions officers will tell you that what bachelor’s degree a student holds has no bearing on the admissions process.
UCLA’s career center website explains that “law schools accept a diverse pool of applicants who major in anything from engineering to political science to film and television.”
That makes sense, since the admissions process is most concerned with selecting students who can thrive in the law school environment, as opposed to focusing specifically on what their undergraduate major was.
So I’m sure the sociology department had good intentions in establishing GW’s undergraduate law minor, but many of the courses in the program have a tenuous relationship to a legal education and what a lawyer does in practice.
But while it might not seem like law and computer science are the most natural combination, it just might be the right mix for those who want to get ahead in a world where competition for jobs is so stiff.

GW hired a pair of researchers from the University of Maryland to study its level of support for multicultural students, part of a years-long push to improve enrollment and retention rates.
The researchers will interview current and former students to gauge the climate of diversity on campus – information that a top GW leader said will help steer an overhaul of the Multicultural Student Services Center.
Terri Harris Reed, the University’s vice provost for diversity and inclusion, said the team will also study retention rates for minority populations.
“What is it that we’re doing that’s actually having an impact on whether or not students are succeeding?” Reed said, adding that the study would also focus on “whether or not we are actually implementing what research says are the best practices to help students persist and retain.”
Maryland professors of higher education Alberto Cabrera and Sharon Fries-Britt will lead the study starting this fall.
Cabrera has spent more than a decade researching low-income and minority students in college settings, focusing mostly on retaining students.
“Many colleges and universities are concerned about what factors enable students to come to universities and succeed. But they try to launch programs – many, many programs – and most of the time, they don’t ask their students or they don’t see what are the impacts,” Cabrera said.
The Maryland researchers, assisted by a group of graduate students, will conduct focus groups of students who transferred from GW, and those who stayed.
Recently, universities have sought to collect and use this kind of data “in a more savvy way,” Cabrera said. That’s likely a direction GW will take, as its newly hired enrollment manager, Laurie Koehler, is already planning to look more strategically at enrollment and admissions statistics.
Fries-Britt spent 30 years as a consultant on diversity issues for schools including Princeton and Johns Hopkins universities. She did not return requests for comment.
The University has seen increasing minority enrollment in the past decade, with about 26 percent of last year’s freshman class identifying as black, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander or multiracial.
Graduation rates for those populations have ticked up as well, hovering around the GW-wide rate of about 80 percent, though data is slow because it’s collected six years after a student enrolls.
Reed said she hopes a revamped focus for MSSC will help GW fill in the information gap when minority students drop out of GW.
“There are times you can look at people and say, ‘Their GPA was fine, they didn’t owe us any money – so what happened?’” Reed said.

Thousands of admitted students chose not to attend GW this year, and the University’s first-ever enrollment manager is trying to understand why.
Laurie Koehler is laying out GW’s data-driven recruitment strategy as rising tuition costs and sluggish selectivity complicates the admissions cycle even further. She was hired this summer to bring together the offices of financial aid, admissions and the registrar’s office for the first time.
With college admissions more competitive than ever, GW is joining dozens of colleges that have tapped a top official to oversee all the parts of that process.
“We can’t look at [enrollment] in these little boxes anymore, of undergraduate admissions and financial aid and registrar,” Koehler said. “We need to think about it more holistically.”
To keep GW ahead of the curve, Koehler is collecting data to better understand what applicants want, from hands-on learning opportunities to the impact of financial aid options.
Within the next two years, the University will record every email, phone and in-person interaction that it has with prospective students through pricey, high-tech software. The technology will also draw connections between admissions and financial aid information.
“If we lay this foundation, then we’re able to make good decisions about tactics and strategies because they’ll be decisions that are rooted in data, not just in, ‘This is what we’ve done’ or, ‘I think this works,’” Koehler said.
She declined to provide the cost of the software but called it “not inexpensive” and said it would be a time-intensive project.
Koehler is taking the reins after years of creeping application numbers and a stagnant acceptance rate.  Over the last three years, applications are up just 2 percent and the University’s admit rate hovers around 33 percent.
Her arrival marks a new era for the admissions office, which saw its top leader, Kathryn Napper, abruptly retire last year after she oversaw class-rank reporting errors that led to GW’s unranking.
Koehler’s work isn’t just about the numbers. The strategy will look to not only help bring students into Foggy Bottom, but also to keep them there.
Nearly 90 percent of students who entered GW in 2010 stayed at GW from their sophomore year to their junior year. That figure was 94 percent for students’ freshman to sophomore years – and while this figure is on par with peer institutions, Koehler is meeting with deans and student life administrators and looking to gather more data to understand why students transfer out.
“Retention, in my mind, like recruitment, is everyone’s responsibility at this University,” Koehler said, adding that professors, students and staff of all levels can drive students to stay in Foggy Bottom or transfer out.
Colleges across the country are increasingly letting data drive the conversations, according to a top official with the Association of American Colleges and Universities. Susan Albertine, vice president of diversity, equity and student success, said colleges are shifting away from the mindset that “you just let students in and then see what happens to them.”
For example, data can give colleges more insight into the pressures and circumstances that can burden underrepresented populations like low-income students, Albertine said.
Director of Undergraduate Admissions Karen Felton said the approach could help GW focus on specific populations such as transfer students.
Terri Harris Reed, who leads GW’s diversity efforts, said she also hopes she can focus more on retention.
“The work around enrollment management is that you inform your admissions practices based on what you know happens to students when they get to your institution,” Reed said. “And so, right now we are saying do we even capture the data to answer that question.”

Due to an editing error, The Hatchet incorrectly reported that 1,500 students chose not to attend GW last year. Thousands more chose not to attend in fact, but 1,500 students responded to a sample survey explaining why they did not attend.

GW is guiding a handful of professors to create massive open online courses, which could start teaching students from around the world by the end of the academic year.
Paul Schiff Berman, vice provost for online education and academic innovation, said MOOCs – free, not-for-credit classes – allow faculty to “reach a larger audience” and share information with those who have little access to education.
“MOOCs should be about faculty empowerment, faculty members who want to experiment with a different modality of education,” Berman said. “I want to provide a way for them to do it.”
The University announced last winter that it would start to plan its own set of free online courses, which have multiplied at top universities like Harvard and Northwestern universities. Now, those plans are taking shape, with subjects like nursing and political management pegged as some of GW’s first MOOCs.
Berman said he hopes to eventually start programs tailored for audiences in developing countries. For example, he cited a possible School of Nursing-led course on neonatal care that would be slower-paced and involve more background exercises than a typical class.
GW is late to the free online education craze. MOOCs, which are often taught by star professors, attracted international media attention last year by drawing thousands of signups.
But some universities that rushed to start their own programs lost faculty support along the way. San Jose State University paused its MOOC program this summer after two semesters.
Berman said the more cautious approach would help professors understand how to translate a class from in-person to online.
Margaret Soltan, an English professor who created a MOOC on her own with the company Udemy last year, said teaching an online class requires a completely different mindset than teaching in the classroom.
“When I teach at GW, I have notes. When I do MOOCs, I’m just so nervous because I’m being filmed, and want everything to be perfect and want to communicate my passion for poetry,” Soltan said.
Craig Linebaugh, a professor of speech and hearing science, said universities have to be reserved about offering MOOCs for credit because it is difficult to gauge how much students learn from them. 
“I have an obligation to the students in my course to assess their level of learning and to make sure they’re learning things,” said Linebaugh, a member of GW’s Teaching and Learning Collaborative. “If you can’t do that in valid and reliable ways, then you probably shouldn’t be getting credit.”
Faculty have other concerns about the online courses as well. In a survey by the Chronicle of Higher Education last spring, 55 percent of professors who taught a MOOC said it had diverted time away from other teaching and research.
Nearly three-quarters did not think students who did well in the open online courses deserved formal academic credit for their work, the survey showed.
For some of these reasons, the University has diverted its attention to degree-granting, tuition-generating online programs as a way to fill its coffers instead.
Now, Berman said the University is looking to use free online courses to spread the word about its top programs, not replace for-credit classes.
“The most important thing is if you’re going to do a course that is going to brand GW and help to sell GW and be a niche for the university, you want it to be good,” Berman said. “So I’m more concerned with making sure the courses are really high quality than I am with making sure they happen really fast.”
Berman declined to say which online provider the University would partner with because the agreements are not finalized. Companies like Coursera and 2U – and nonprofit ventures like EdX – have led the way in helping colleges start MOOCs.

In a mayoral campaign crowded with D.C. Council insiders, GW students campaigning for a lesser-known candidate are pitching an alternative to business-as-usual city politics.
Senior Jeremy Rosenberg is coordinating a student effort to elect Reta Jo Lewis – a longtime D.C. resident who has spent the majority of her career in federal service.
Lewis, who worked in the State Department under Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, said students have driven community outreach and volunteer recruitment, playing key roles in her campaign.
“Students bring fresh ideas, energy, enthusiasm and support,” Lewis said, adding that she herself worked on local and national campaigns as a student. “That’s what I want my campaign to be about: people coming together, trying to make a difference, and being a part of the debate that shapes their futures and the future of D.C.”
A 59-year-old Georgia native, Lewis will face off against Council members Jack Evans, Muriel Bowser and Tommy Wells, who all bring years of experience in D.C. political races. Lewis, the last candidate to join the race, has raised the least amount of money in her bid for mayor among the pool of candidates so far.
Lewis, the former chair of the D.C. Commission on Women, has mentioned gender and minority rights in her campaign platform, but her positions on most political issues have remained vague.
Rosenberg said he learned about Lewis’ campaign through a local politics blog, noticing her work as special assistant to former President Bill Clinton and director of South African leader Nelson Mandela’s tour of the U.S.
“She was refreshing, someone with a wide portfolio who could push students and young professionals in the District to play a crucial role in D.C.’s future,” Rosenberg said.
Lewis also worked on President Barack Obama’s transition team in 2008. But even with her extensive resume, Lewis has struggled to compete with candidates who boast name recognition and hands-on experience in D.C. politics.
But student volunteer David Ehrenberg said Lewis stands out because of her appeals to younger people in the District.
“Her outreach to students and young professionals is second to none, and she’s been so enthusiastic about meeting people across the city,” Ehrenberg said.
“It has been great seeing how dedicated she is to involving students,” Sharon Wolner, another volunteer, said.
The international law attorney jumped into the mayoral race over the summer, with the city’s Democratic primary slated for April 1. Rosenberg said the early start will help Lewis compete with the likes of the Council members.
“We’ve been recruiting through every social medium, and word of mouth has been really helpful. It really shows that this is a grassroots movement,” Rosenberg said.
