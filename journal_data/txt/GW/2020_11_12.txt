Located inside D.C.'s newest food hall, Hi/Fi Taco offers a twist on classic Mexican fare.
For tacos with a twist, head to Hi/Fi Taco.
The taco shop is located at 1401 Pennsylvania Ave. SE inside The Roost, the District’s newest food hall, and just across from the Potomac Avenue Metro stop. The recently-opened food hall offers an ample amount of indoor and outdoor seating, along with options for pick up and delivery for all of its vendors.
Hi/Fi Taco’s menu features playful riffs on traditional Mexican food. The ordering system also allows for customers to indicate allergies and dietary restrictions, which the restaurant staff can easily address while preparing your dishes.
Customers can choose from Mexican-inspired appetizers like bacon cheeseburger queso ($11) with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles or Valentina hot wings ($12) topped with smoked crema, pickled peppers, cilantro and green onions.
Other than appetizers, the Hi/Fi Taco menu is simple with an assortment of tacos. Each taco order comes with two tacos in varieties like orange soda-braised carnitas ($5.75) with curtido – a Salvadoran cabbage slaw – smoked crema, American cheese and chicharones, or fried pork rinds, and mojo-braised chicken ($5.75) with avocado crema, enchilada sauce and shredded lettuce.
If you’re looking for something to sip on, Hi/Fi Taco offers an assortment of Jarritos sodas ($3) in flavors like guava, mango and pineapple.
I decided to order Hi/Fi Taco’s crispy avocado tacos ($5.75) because I had never seen anything like them on a menu before. The two tacos came on soft corn tortillas, were spread with black beans and topped with avocado crema, pickled onions and a sprinkling of thinly-sliced radishes.
The tortillas were soft, yet sturdy enough to hold the assortment of toppings and a generous smear of smoky black beans that were super flavorful from the addition of jalapeno.
Each taco came with a large slice of avocado that had been delicately fried in a tempura-like batter. I had never had fried avocado before and was worried that the texture might taste weird, but I was pleasantly surprised. The integrity of the avocado’s texture remained the same and was elevated by the crunchy exterior of the fried batter.
The additional toppings each added a different texture and flavor to the tacos. The avocado crema was creamy, the pickled onions were slightly crunchy and tangy while the radishes were bitter and added a bit of crispness.
Just a few Metro stops away from campus, the trip to Hi/Fi Taco was well worth it for its unconventional take on tacos.

Redshirt junior forward Neila Luma is the only athlete between the men's and women's squads to receive a preseason accolade.
Redshirt junior forward Neila Luma was named to the Atlantic 10’s women’s basketball preseason All-Conference Third Team, according to a press release Monday.
Luma is entering her fourth year with the program as the most tenured student-athlete on the roster. She was the only Colonial on the men’s or women’s side to earn a preseason accolade.
A year ago, she was also named to the preseason All-Conference Second Team. Luma was the Colonials’ leading returning scorer and rebounder heading into the 2019-20 season, but a season-ending knee injury sidelined her for all but five games and forced her to take a redshirt season. In those five games, she averaged 5.6 points and 5.0 rebounds per game in 25.6 average minutes.
During the 2018-19 campaign, Luma averaged 10.4 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. She ranked second on the squad with 24 steals, shot 39 percent from the floor in 28.1 minutes per game and recorded 16 double-figure scoring games.
In her career, Luma has started 94.1 percent of the 68 games she’s appeared in, averaging 27.5 minutes per contest. She fires at a .390 career clip from the field for 8.4 points per game.
To round out the preseason festivities, the women’s basketball program placed ninth out of 14 teams in the A-10’s 2020-21 preseason poll.

The University of Richmond's squad is projected to be at the top of the Atlantic 10 conference this year.
Men’s basketball is projected to finish 11th in a field of 14 Atlantic 10 teams, according to a press release Tuesday.
The team has slowly improved its preseason ranking throughout the last two years, jumping from No. 13 prior to the 2018-19 campaign to No. 12 before the 2019-20 season. The squad last sat at No. 11 in the preseason poll before the 2017-18 season.
No Colonial was selected to a preseason Conference Team.
Last season, the squad tabbed a 12-20 overall finish and a 6-12 record in conference play under head coach Jamion Christian’s first year. The Colonials ended the year on a first round exit at the A-10 Tournament, which was eventually called off amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Richmond is expected to be the team to beat this season, receiving 19 first-place votes from head coaches and select media members. Last season, the Spiders finished 24-7 overall, tacking on a .778 conference winning percentage. Richmond bested GW in both of its meetings last season.
Saint Louis and Dayton, respectively, rounded out the top three teams in the poll. The Billikens earned seven first place votes and the Flyers notched two votes for the No. 1 position.
GW’s 2020-21 season will begin Wednesday, Nov. 25 at the Veterans Classic. The Colonials will hit the road for the first time this season against Navy for a noon tipoff.

Over the last few days, 2020 got a little darker – and not just because of Alex Trebek’s passing or the American president’s refusal to concede a free and fair election. The event that quite literally cast a shadow over daily life was the end of daylight saving time, which has consigned most of the country to total darkness by 5 p.m. for the next few months.
The yearly tradition of setting our clocks back an hour in the fall is almost universally recognized as a harbinger of cold weather and short days. But the sun setting so early affects us beyond portending the onset of winter: it makes us sadder and sicker. And during a brutal pandemic, the last thing we need is to be sadder and sicker.
The sun setting an hour earlier has been tied to an increase in depression and anxiety, especially in people who have those conditions already. Even for those without preexisting mental health diagnoses, reduced daylight tends to make people generally less joyous and more apathetic. The x-factor in 2020 is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has set off its own mental health crisis. Rates of depression and anxiety have skyrocketed since March, and U.S. public health officials fear that the end of daylight saving time may pour gas on the flame.
The original intent of daylight saving time was valid – the government wanted to save fuel during World War I by optimizing the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to make the most use of daylight. While that may have reduced energy consumption at the time, any positive effect today is nonexistent.
Daylight saving time may even have a death toll – rates of heart attack and stroke tend to increase after the time change, as do traffic accidents. Changing the clocks forward or back one hour twice a year may also lower our immunity to disease. Making people more susceptible to illness at a societal level should probably be avoided in general – but once again, the pandemic adds a fresh kicker to existing downsides of the time change. It goes without saying that lowering immunity to disease should be avoided during a pandemic that has sickened 10 million people. The health crisis is spreading virtually unchecked across the globe, and no effort should be spared in fighting it.
There is a fairly clear solution to the problem. Congress has the power to change daylight saving time – which it did as recently as 2005 – or eliminate it entirely. There is some debate about whether daylight saving time should be abolished or made permanent – essentially, the former would make it lighter in the mornings, while the latter would make it lighter in the evenings. In either case, the public would enjoy tangible benefits over the system in place right now. And while the discussion about whether to extend or abolish has not quite entered the public consciousness, opinion polls show broad support for getting rid of the twice-yearly clock change.
Here’s some free advice to an incoming government facing down a health crisis and widespread public disdain: tackling this issue is a no-brainer.

When I was growing up in a mixed race family, my Korean ethnicity always felt like it was second to being White.
I’d only see Hangul, the written form of Korean, at a church where I went to Korean school on Saturdays or on the menus at the handful of Korean restaurants where I’d eat with my immigrant Korean mother and sister. Most of the predominantly White community in my part of Pennsylvania knew very little about Korea, let alone the Asian continent. Growing up, most people would ask whether I was Chinese or Japanese, as if all Asians were the same.  This may explain why Korea is commonly characterized in American history as the “hermit kingdom” or “the shrimp between two whales.” But despite how seemingly tiny Korea is, it has brought about monumental contributions to society that people must learn to appreciate, not appropriate.
Korea has come a long way from being a former Japanese-occupied colony and a war-torn nation, into which my mother was born, to now the 12th largest economy in the world. The country’s major successes come from the recent emergence and popularity of Korean smartphones from Samsung, high-end luxury cars from Hyundai, K-Pop music from BTS or award-winning films like “Parasite.” Everyone, including Koreans, has benefitted from its worldwide success.
But as a result of its success, non-Koreans have become obsessed with anything Korean, claiming the very historical and traditional parts of our culture that date back 5,000 years. People have worn traditional attire of the Hanbok in a lot of places I’ve never seen before – proms, fundraising events and dinner parties that have nothing to do with Korea or have Korean people in them. This phenomenon is so widespread that this group of non-Koreans has been dubbed “Koreaboos” around the world. While non-Koreans are allowed and should be able to appreciate Korean culture, they by no means have a right to appropriate centuries-old clothing or use certain Korean catchphrases like it’s an accessory for their daily fit of the day.
As a Korean American, I find it negligent and disrespectful for others who don’t know much about Korea to exploit components of my culture like it is a trendy phase. My culture deserves more respect than watching non-Korean people spit out Korean phrases as a means to annoy other non-Koreans on TikTok for views and likes.
Take, for example, the Hanbok – the term for a traditional two-piece attire that Korean men and women used to wear daily centuries ago, now in present day for ceremonial purposes, festivals or other events of great significance in their community. Wearing the Hanbok inherently shows a sign of respect to other attendees at the event as well as for the event itself. It is not offensive when a non-Korean person wears a Hanbok to events at places like historic Korean palaces, or are posting about the Hanbok itself to recognize its great significance. But if someone is taking a selfie or wearing it to a party for people to tell them they look good, it’s disrespectful. If you took the time to purchase a Hanbok to wear at any kind of event, you should’ve looked more into what it was before treating it like another Halloween costume.
Instead of rushing into things that social media would condition you to think are fashionable, slow down for a second and consider the implications of your choices. Don’t be afraid to ask for guidance or advice online or from a friend. You won’t know what you’re truly doing unless you acquire the knowledge to make these kinds of informed decisions like wearing a Hanbok warrant. Replace the impatient, defensive tone of “what’s the big deal?” to “how can I listen and do better?” when someone is trying to have a meaningful dialogue with you about changing questionable behavior. Be a better ally by separating appreciation and appropriation, and remember Korean is more than “funny sounding” words or memes that go viral on the Subtle Asian Traits page on Facebook.
My own grandfather was a starving teenager because of both World War II and the Korean War, dealing with the unforgiving fallout in Korea. To redeem a seemingly obliterated land, he among many hard working Koreans grappled back to prosperity and would be ashamed to see how fetishized his culture is by the West today. Determined people like him helped make Korea what it is today, and that should never be trivialized. While Koreans, including myself, are indeed here to laugh with you and unite us all as we openly share Korean culture, I think we can all agree that Koreans deserve the same respect my people constantly afford others.

Over the summer, amid a pandemic that was already causing stress for students and staff alike, University President Thomas LeBlanc, the Board of Trustees and other officials chose to add fuel to the fire by hiring Heather Swain, a known conspirator in the coverup of more than 150 sexual assaults. Then, after the Faculty Senate chose to express “severe disapproval” of the hire during a meeting that LeBlanc did not even have the guts to attend, two professors rightfully penned an op-ed criticizing the senate for failing to censure LeBlanc. But even more appalling is professor Charles Garris’ response to that piece, arguing that Swain should have been hired and the senate was out of line for its weak expression of disapproval.
Garris was dead wrong, LeBlanc was dead wrong, the senate was dead wrong and The Hatchet was wrong for allowing this faulty article to go to print in a manner that disregarded the editorial standards other writers and I are consistently held to. Rape apologists and rape erasers have no place in our community, Swain’s hiring was unethical and tone-deaf while the support from Garris was blind to reality and irrelevant.
Before we even discuss the fact that Swain was complicit in the cover-up of hundreds of sexual assaults occurring over the course of several decades, let’s look at the circumstances in which LeBlanc hired her. The summer was notoriously demoralizing for students, faculty and staff alike as mass layoffs took place across the University. Swain was hired in a non-competitive process during a hiring freeze at the University. While administrators lamented the funding shortages necessitating the mass layoff of Black and Brown employees, they seemingly found the money to employ a wealthy White woman who is an enemy to survivors of sexual violence everywhere. The fact that the hiring was non-competitive seems to suggest that, out of all qualified people, Swain was specifically chosen. Her hiring was made to be secret, buried in the deluge of pandemic-related news. Instead, their underboard hiring was exposed, further depressing students and staff and only intensifying the rage directed at LeBlanc.
But Garris, a professor in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, took to The Hatchet to argue, crudely, that Swain should have been hired and the whole scandal was overblown because “there is no evidence from the counsel’s report that Swain did anything wrong” and “Swain was a victim of an out-of-control GW social media echo chamber that mercilessly slandered her with misinformation.” Let’s look at the facts: from 1992 to 2015, Larry Nassar assaulted more than 150 teenagers and young adults in his role as a doctor with USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. During the investigation, Swain was found to have been involved in a culture of anti-transparency by diligently shielding information from prosecutors. One of her preferred methods was to include school lawyers on email threads so they could be withheld from others. Garris, out of ignorance or malice, misconstrued information about Swain’s role by stating that she did nothing wrong. While the true extent of her role may never be fully known, thanks in part to her cover-up, any role, tacit or direct, in enabling the rape and abuse of hundreds of young women should be immediately disqualifying, notwithstanding the other ethical issues surround her secret hiring.
Swain, it should be noted, feigned ignorance about the situation. Even if the unlikely scenario of her ignorance proved true, such blindness to rampant abuse in a senior position at MSU should have been disqualifying for a role at the University. GW cannot afford to hire administrators who are unaware of such problems.
Garris was right about one thing: Swain was caught in a social media echo chamber, one made of more than a thousand angry voices, many of them survivors of sexual violence themselves, demanding successfully that her hiring offer be rescinded. They did the right thing, they ensured that Swain would not be able to harm another student in our community. Garris, on the other hand, placed himself firmly on the wrong side of history. Speaking baselessly from the standpoint of an old White man, about the advocacy spearheaded by young women.
All this brings me to my final question of why The Hatchet decided to publish a story that misconstrued the facts of Swain’s hiring. As proud writers in the opinions section, we are held to the highest standards of correctness and asked at every pitch meeting what relevance of exigency our ideas have in the current climate. It was disappointing to see that this op-ed was held to a different standard, even though our writing appears on the same page. As the independent student voice at this University, The Hatchet must take a stronger stance against rape apology, even when it comes from a professor. In my eyes, this paper is complicit in some ways too.
Ultimately, it was Swain, not GW, that made the decision to sever ties. Despite an apology, the University must work to regain credibility and respect from students, faculty and staff. The whole ordeal raises important questions about the culture of sexual violence at this school and underscores the need for continued vigilance against all forms of sexual violence and apologies for such behavior.

The task force will evaluate the body's bylaws and make changes in the spring.
The Student Association Senate passed legislation Monday to create a task force that will reform the organization’s bylaws by spring.
Senators said the New Constitution Transition task force will examine the body’s governing documents and amend it to align changes made to the SA constitution in March. SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G and a sponsor of the bill, said the task force members will review aspects of the SA’s bylaws, like the number of votes needed to secure a senate seat, to reflect changes made in the constitution.
“My goal with the whole task force is to really think structurally about how this organization functions at every level, in every branch and figure out how we can be more responsive to students’ concerns,” he said.
Eleven senators joined the task force, which Falcigno will lead. He said the task force will release a list of recommendations for the updated bylaws by March 1 to complete the changes by the spring.
The senate also passed a resolution approving the release of a survey about graduate student tuition changes, which the graduate student caucus will use to advocate for decreased tuition. Graduate students have been pushing for a tuition discount, as undergraduates received this academic year, since the summer.
The resolution also comes after the senate passed a resolution in April requiring all SA surveys to be approved in the senate before they are released.
SA Sen. Sebastian Weinmann, Law-G and a sponsor of the resolution, said the results of the survey will be discussed in a graduate student town hall later this month.
Senators approved a bill that decreases the number of vacancy applications that are sent to the full senate after they are vetted by the governance and nominations committee from three to two candidates. Senators said the change will increase efficiency during full senate meetings.
The senate also approved a resolution applauding the senators who advocated for free newspaper subscriptions at The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
Senators also confirmed Chloe Wagner, a junior in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, as the chairperson of the Joint Election Commission, which oversees SA elections.

The adjustment will only apply to the fall semester and will be reversed in the spring, according to the email.
Officials are slightly relaxing restrictions on the guest policy for on-campus students.
Stewart Robinette and Seth Weinshel, the assistant deans of students for Campus Living and Residential Education, announced Wednesday that effective immediately, they will allow on-campus residents to host one resident in their room, as long as the guest is from the same residence hall. Students will be able to visit one another between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., and guests must follow social-distancing and mask-wearing guidelines officials have previously set.
“The fall adjustment is contingent upon continued successful adherence by the majority of residents to the public health measures that have limited the rates of COVID-19 transmission on campus,” Robinette and Weinshel said in an email to on-campus residents.
The adjustment will only apply to the fall semester and will be reversed in the spring, according to the email. Students are still not allowed to have visitors living off campus in their rooms.
“Visitors who are not part of our approved on-campus cohort this semester, including family or friends, may not be following the same public health protocols such as testing and symptom monitoring, and their visits may put our community at risk,” Robinette and Weinshel said.
The move comes days after GW’s test positivity rate surpassed 2 percent for the first time this semester.
Students in quarantine or isolation are not allowed to have guests, the email states. The policy does not apply to student-athletes living on campus, according to the email.
“Student athletes living in affinity spaces are prohibited from hosting or being guests outside of their team bubble,” the email states.
About 500 students were allowed to move into on-campus housing this fall, needing to adhere to strict social-distancing guidelines.
