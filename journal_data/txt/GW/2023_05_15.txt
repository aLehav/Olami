While the school-from-home setup was filled with sweatpants and loungewear, this year’s seniors emerged from quarantine with a new sense of style that embodied being true to themselves.
Whether it came from embracing sexuality, excitement about finally leaving the house again, or the influence of social media platforms like TikTok, some GW seniors went through a style evolution from 2019 to 2023. Graduating seniors said while the world came to a halt in 2020 and the fashion trends began to change, they spent their extra alone time rediscovering themselves and the clothes that represent them.
Jenna Boatman, a graduating senior majoring in English and creative writing, arrived at our interview oozing in hip style. They layered a flower-patterned patchwork vest over a sage green tank top that they paired with a white lace skirt, tights, and an oversized black leather jacket. They completed the look with a pair of platform Doc Martens. 
Boatman adorned their fit with butterfly earrings, golden necklaces, and lockets that were only outshined by their hair and makeup. Neon pink and orange hair in the front and yellow and green stripes in the back met spunky winged eyeliner and sparkly eyeshadow, truly completing the look. 
Boatman said their outfit marked a stark contrast to what they described as their freshman year style — “basic,” having a closet filled with skinny jeans, crop tops, and chunky white Filas. It wasn’t until the pandemic that Boatman’s style began to evolve.
“2020 was such a formative year for me and coming more into my queer identity,” Boatman said.
Joining the queer community helped Boatman experiment with new styles. They tried hair colors ranging from brown pieces in the front to all blue, got more into jewelry, and began thrifting and shopping at vintage stores. They found inspiration on Pinterest and began to put more effort into their day-to-day looks in order to keep a sense of normalcy by “getting ready” for classes even though they were on Zoom during the pandemic.

They eventually landed on the subfashion genre “whimsigoth,” clothing that combines darker color palates with romantic styles — like vampire meets fairy princess — as an embodiment of their style, which they found inspiration from on TikTok.
“It’s taking darker elements but making them a little bit more girly,” Boatman said.
When reflecting on their style evolution, Boatman notes that the lack of personal style they displayed freshman year was less to do with understanding fashion trends than their understanding of themselves. Once Boatman embraced their queer identity, they were able to express their truest self through their style, following queer styles.
“I feel like part of the reason that I had no grasp on the style then is because I barely had a grasp on myself,” Boatman said. 
Graduating senior and international affairs and creative writing major Sasha Agarwal experienced a similar connection between style and sexuality. They described their freshman-year fashion choices as prioritizing comfortable clothes, mainly sweatpants and sweatshirts.

They said going through personal changes regarding their gender and sexuality helped transform their style going into junior year, when GW returned to in-person operations. Agarwal cut their hair short, swapped out glasses for contacts and began to take an interest in thrifting and jewelry.
“I think a lot of people had the experience that over the pandemic, it was a time where a lot of people were able to think about their sexuality and things like that,” Agarwal said.
Agarwal said this evolution of their style was initially sparked by a desire to fit in with the queer community but now they draw confidence from this shift rather than the other way around. They now opt for minimalist gold jewelry, neutral colors, and vintage finds from markets in their hometown of Kansas City.
“The things that I wear now and my fashion and everything really reflect the changes I’ve made as a person, it makes me feel more comfortable with expressing myself as a queer person and just like the kind of personality I have in general,” Agarwal said.
Marisol Cabrera, a senior majoring in journalism and mass communication, also experienced style evolution post-COVID after she rid her closet of infrequently worn pieces and focused on developing a minimalist wardrobe filled with mock neck tops for layering and versatile straight-legged jeans. During freshman year, Cabrera said she fell victim to fast-fashion trends, shopping frequently at H&M, and it wasn’t until after the pandemic that she began to develop a sense of personal style that was also more sustainable.

Homegrown in Naperville, Illinois, Cabrera said she incorporates her midwestern roots into her style and frequently draws inspiration from social media platforms like TikTok. She likes to describe her style as “Scandinavian but make it midwestern,” a chic combination of midwestern patterns and Scandinavian neutral, minimalist pieces. 
“It’s just kind of fun to play into your hometown roots and stuff like that, just to make your style a little bit more personal,” Cabrera said. 
Cabrera tries to shop secondhand, ideally 80 percent thrifted items and 20 percent new items. She said she loves to use the online platform Thredup for vintage finds and affordable pieces like a wool Aritzia sweater, which she can buy for a fraction of its original cost. 
“I would say I’m a lot more confident in my style now than I’ve been ever before,” Cabrera said. “It’s also just fun to match outfits to different occasions.”
Graduating senior and international affairs and geographical information systems major Cameron Cayer said the pandemic was also a time when he learned to stop caring what others thought about his outfits. Prior to the pandemic, he described his style as colorfully basic, donning many button-ups. But while quarantining during his sophomore year, he said he began to experiment with clothing from the women’s section for more stylistic freedom, choosing blouses, sweaters, and tank tops.

“So that’s when I started buying a lot of women’s clothes because I go thrifting, and I would end up liking the women’s section better,” Cayer said.
During his junior year, Cayer said he treated fashion as more of an art form, wearing intricate and colorful pieces of clothing as he gained confidence in his style. The change marks his personal growth from wanting to be seen and noticed to just dressing for himself.
“I’m happy that I’m leaving senior year with my own style, with my own concepts about fashion but not necessarily wearing things in order to please others,” Cayer said.

Nestled in the residential streets of Georgetown, the Dumbarton Oaks estate offers the ideal off-campus trip for the avid "Pride and Prejudice" fan in your life, between the week's commencement festivities.
For families that have been visiting their students in the District for years, checking out the usual tourist locations might not cut it anymore. 
Trips to the monuments and National Mall may lose their luster after your first few years at GW, but D.C. still offers an abundance of interesting activities for visitors of all ages. Whether you want to learn something new at a museum or explore the natural beauty of the city, there’s something in the city for everyone. 
The Hatchet compiled a collection of “hidden-gem” locations that highlight the historical prowess and visual beauty of D.C. Here is a roundup of places you can take family and friends visiting during Commencement week:
Dumbarton Oaks
If you have a “Pride and Prejudice” fan in your life, a trip to Dumbarton Oaks should be at the top of your list to satisfy the need to see an English country-style estate and garden. Located in the darling residential streets of Georgetown, Dumbarton Oaks is an estate that consists of a garden and a museum with Byzantine and pre-Columbian art. 
Take a look at the ancient Roman Mosaic with Apollo and the vast collection of Byzantine coins in the museum. Plus, the Music Room features intricate paintings and tapestries of the Renaissance in a warmly lit environment. 
The 27-acre garden looks straight out of a Jane Austen novel with oak trees, ivy-lined stairs and fountains, and a plethora of blooming flowers, like rose bushes. Bring your family to explore the stone arches and hidden gates before relaxing on the benches scattered across the grounds. 
1703 32nd St. NW. Museum open Tuesday through Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Garden open Tuesday through Sunday from 2 to 6 p.m. Museum admission is free. Find more information here. 
Art Museum of the Americas
The District boasts more than 70 museums ranging from art galleries to the National Air and Space Museum, but if you want to take your family somewhere other than a Smithsonian, take a trip to the Art Museum of the Americas. The AMA specializes in the modern and contemporary art of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
The museum is currently hosting artist Dominique Paul’s “Silent Fall,” a multimedia exhibition with visual pieces and video installations spotlighting the effects of declining biodiversity in the Americas.
After strolling the galleries, be sure to check out their courtyard with a large, well-kept grass area and smaller outdoor sculptures. Admission is free, making the AMA a splendid way to spend an afternoon in D.C.
201 18th St. NW. Open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free. Find more information here. 
National Postal Museum 
I may be a biased avid stamp collector, but I consider the Postal Museum to be the most criminally underrated Smithsonian because of its niche theme and role in the persistence of philately, the study and collection of stamps.
Check out global stamps and historic postal paraphernalia dating back numerous decades in their permanent collection in the William H. Gross Stamp Gallery. The museum even allows you to dig through boxes of retro stamps — both domestic and international — and pick out six of your favorites to take home for free in an envelope to start your own collection. 
Baseball fans can also explore postal memorabilia and fan letters dedicated to the sport in the museum’s temporary exhibition, “Baseball: America’s Home Run,” which will be on display until early 2025. 
2 Massachusetts Ave. NE. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission is free. Find more information here. 
Garden at Old Stone House
If you want to take a break while shopping on Georgetown’s famous M Street, look no further than the garden at the Old Stone House. Tucked away on M Street NW, the historic house is a charming two-story 1766 cottage which the National Park Service says is known to be “the oldest structure on its original foundation” in D.C.
Behind the house, there is a serene garden that features a small grass area, flower bushes, and wooden benches, making it a great spot to read a book or chat with loved ones. It is a quiet getaway amid the hustle and bustle of the shopping district — I recommend grabbing an iced coffee and chocolate chip walnut cookie at nearby Levain Bakery before heading over. 
3051 M St. NW. House open Friday through Monday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Garden open daily from sunrise to sunset. Admission is free. Find more information here. 
Record-store hopping
Analog music fans will love the District’s selection of record stores.
Smash Records is an iconic marker of D.C.’s rich punk scene and history, specializing in punk and alternative clothing and music. Peruse their wide selection of vinyl and CDs and don’t miss checking out the vintage clothing section, with racks stuffed full of rock and roll merchandise and pieces designed by indie clothing architects.
Joint Custody on U Street NW is another great option with a particularly large collection of band merchandise, whether you want to hang up a classic jazz poster or rock a t-shirt from your favorite rock band. Check out brand new releases on vinyl or sift through boxes of used records to search for hidden gems — the store even has old record players to pick up and play your records on wherever post-graduation life takes you.
Smash Records is located at 2314 18th St. NW, open Monday through Thursday noon to 8 p.m., Friday and Saturday noon to 9 p.m. and Sunday noon to 7 p.m. Joint Custody is located at 1530 U St. NW, open every day noon to 8 p.m.

International snacking subscription SnackCrate makes the perfect token for a proponent of the Ambassador moniker option, gifting a monthly spread of foods and candies from around the globe. 
Four years of hard work interrupted by a pandemic means this college graduation season is no time to skimp on gifts.
This commencement season, stray from a simple, stereotypical graduation gift and reach for something you could only buy for a graduate of GW’s Class of 2023.
GW, which is in the process of choosing a new moniker to replace the Colonials, gives you a small array of inspired nicknames to draw gift ideas from. There are four options — Ambassadors, Blue Fog, Revolutionaries and Sentinels. Choose a gift for your graduate based on their favorite moniker option as a final #OnlyatGW Moment.
Ambassadors: SnackCrate’s Around the World Snacks ($5 to $20)
If your favorite graduate spent most of their two-and-a-half years’ in-person experience at college perfecting their status as a hard-working academic in the Elliott School, why don’t you reach for a gift to reflect their international ambitions?
In considering a gift for them, reach for a subscription to SnackCrate, a monthly box full of snacks from around the world. You can choose the country for the first box, perhaps pulling from their concentrated area of study, like the Middle East or Latin America. These monthly blue boxes may provide culinary knowledge of the region by introducing their recipients to the food of the areas.
In the past, SnackCrate has featured snacks from the Americas, Europe and Asia. With about ten snacks per box, treats vary based on the country, including Turkey’s chocolate-coated crisp candy bar and hard, coffee-flavored candies from Colombia. Even if your aspiring ambassador never leaves the United States, their taste buds can mingle with culinary confections from all around the world.
Blue Fog: Tasting Kit from Founding Farmers ($59.99)
The Blue Fog moniker option is a combination of ideas from the administration and graduating senior Olivia Curran. Curran developed the “Fog” idea, and the University, for reasons unknown, added the “Blue.” Blue Fog alludes to the University’s Foggy Bottom location and the Battle of Long Island, during which a cloud of fog rolled in to allow George Washington’s Continental Army to row safely to Manhattan to escape the British army.
If your graduate likes this option, they must have great pride in the historic and local significance of the University — or they just like chaos. In considering a graduation gift, get them an assortment of alcoholic beverages in a Founding Spirits’ Tasting Kit from popular Foggy Bottom restaurant Founding Farmers.
Though Founding Farmers has expanded around D.C. as well as surrounding states, they opened their first restaurant in 2008 on Pennsylvania Avenue in Foggy Bottom. Their Tasting Kit has miniature glass bottles of locally distilled gin, vodka, bourbon and American amaro. Each bottle contains a half pint of its respective liquor. After a night spent with these locally made liquors, your graduate is sure to end up at the bottom of their apartment with a foggy memory.
Revolutionaries: George Washington’s Revolutionary Presidential Poster ($12.95)
Does your special graduate prefer a name with a strong historical connection? David Silverman, a professor of history, argued Revolutionaries is the most historically accurate option, true to George Washington’s legacy as the leader of the Continental Army.
Reach for a gift that reflects George Washington’s revolutionary legacy, like a poster showing the founding father and the thirteen colonies he led to statehood. A crisp cardstock print, this poster comes from an exhibit at the Library of Congress about Amos Doolittle, a printer who commercialized Washington’s image following his 1788 campaign for president. In the poster, Washington’s head and shoulders rest in the middle, surrounded by seals for each of the 13 colonies he led to statehood.
The poster is one of the first American presidential political prints, transforming political communication in the United States. In addition to being a great graduation gift, it will serve as a kitschy piece of decor for any postgraduate apartment.
Sentinels: A Rat Stuffed Animal ($24.99)
If your graduate is intelligent enough to know what a “sentinel” is without using the internet, they deserve to graduate summa cum laude. For those of us who needed to do some extra research, sentinels are soldiers who are supposed to keep watch. Though anyone who watches over something can be a sentinel, usually sentinels are on guard for a surprise attack.
As a GW student, your graduate surely knows a few things about a surprise attack. Though the threat of a professor’s pop quiz or the chance of an arriving presidential motorcade looms over GW students’ days, there is one small, furry creature on the Foggy Bottom campus for which students must always keep a watchful eye out — rats.
Whether coming back late from a night out on the town or while on a power walk to an 8 a.m. class, almost every GW student has encountered the rats. To commemorate the creature for which they are sentinels, adopt a rat stuffed animal for your graduate. Though it may cause an initial jumpscare with its big, black eyes and crouched stature, your graduate will surely warm up to the stuffed creature, finding its soft fur enticing and comforting. Each time they look at it, they will remember the days spent keeping a keen eye out for the rats, like a sentinel.

The historic Ben's Chili Bowl on U Street offers a creative and tasty setting for your graduation photos, with its bold decorations inside and outside of the building and easy access to its iconic menu items following your photo shoot.
Commencement at GW means one thing — National Mall and monument graduation photos of new GW alums.
The desire to flex your connection to GW under a stoic Abraham Lincoln is perfectly understandable, as after living in the heart of the nation’s capital for the past few years, students may want to show off the iconic landmarks that served as their backyards one last time. But to stand out on your friends’ Instagram feeds and display a different side of the city apart from the shadow of the U.S. Capitol, try one of these spots around campus for grad photos.
For the movie buff: “The Exorcist” steps
Corner of 36th and Prospect streets NW
D.C. isn’t a city brimming with connections to the film industry like Los Angeles or New York City. But the District is still home to a slice of movie history via “The Exorcist” steps in Georgetown.
Located on the corner of 36th Street NW and Prospect Street, the narrow stairwell is surrounded on one side by a cobblestone wall and on the other by a salmon-colored brick apartment building. Light shines down the small stone arch at the top of the stairs, providing the perfect illumination for students as they take their photos.
But the rustic feel of the stairwell isn’t why it was recognized as a D.C. landmark in 2015. The stairs were featured in the 1973 horror classic “The Exorcist,” when priest Damien Karras (Jason Miller) is thrown to the bottom of the steps by the demonically possessed Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair).
While setting a joyous celebration of the culmination of your four years at GW at a location famous for its use in one of the scariest films ever made, the stairs are a legitimately pleasant locale. The bright colors and pastoral setting make them an unexpected but scenic spot to take commencement photos, especially for graduating cinephiles.
Plus, any devil’s advocates caught up with their own demons will relish the chance to pose lying down at the bottom of the steps.
For the foodie: Ben’s Chili Bowl
1213 U St. NW
Many find one of the best parts about attending school in the heart of the District is the D.C. food scene — the city is brimming with delicious local chains like Duke’s Grocery and upscale eateries like Le Diplomate, where multiple U.S. senators might walk through the door on a Friday night. But no D.C. restaurant is as famous as Ben’s Chili Bowl on U Street because of its history in the District and the numerous celebrities like Miles Davis and Duke Ellington who have wandered in searching for a chili dog.
The restaurant is most known for being the home of the half-smoke, the eatery’s chili dog, which is drowned for hours in their homemade chili sauce, but they also offer a variety of burgers, fries and even some vegetarian options. But 65-year-old chili joint doesn’t just have iconic food, it also boasts bold decorations inside and outside of the building, making it the ultimate spot for foodie seniors to snap their graduation pictures.
The front of the restaurant features a fire-engine red and yellow sign hanging underneath a white-brick arch informing viewers they are at a Washington landmark. A bear statue, colorfully decorated with pop art patchwork and an illustration of Ben’s chili bowl, plunked in front of the windowfront also gives graduates someone to pose with if any family members can’t make it.
The side of the building hosts a vibrant mural commemorating African American history, with Black icons like Barack Obama and Taraji P. Henson. After you finish adjusting lighting, make sure your smile is just right and take some postable photos, you can pop into the restaurant and grab a half-smoke — just be sure not to get the sauce on your formal wear.
For someone who wants their own space: Theodore Roosevelt Island
700 George Washington Memorial Parkway, McLean, Virginia
While the National Mall is iconic in American history, taking graduation photos there poses the problem of numerous tourists or other graduates wandering into the background of your photos. Rather than let random people be a part of your special moment, escape to the less crowded Theodore Roosevelt Island to get your history and nature fix.
Located in the Potomac River, the island is brimming with both the story of America and the environment — just without so many people around. Roosevelt Island has, appropriately, a towering statue of a triumphant-but-rusted Theodore Roosevelt holding up a fist in celebration in its center, ideal for American history enthusiasts to pose beside as they also celebrate their triumph over GW.
For students more drawn to the National Mall for its green spaces, Theodore Roosevelt Island has flora and fauna in spades — you can hike all over the island to find the most scenic tree or lake by which to smile at the camera. Particularly beautiful is the island’s more marsh-like area full of tall grasses and rustic bridges to see D.C. landmarks like the Georgetown waterfront — but be careful, though this part of the island isn’t hopping with tourists, wild deer may pass by in the background and photobomb you themselves.
For the fun lover: A very big chair
3500 R St. NW
Graduation photos are meant to capture a crucial moment in one’s life, but that doesn’t mean they can’t also be fun. To encapsulate the joy of graduating college in a more humorous way, stop by the giant adirondack chair in Georgetown.
Located outside the Duke Ellington School of the Arts on R Street, the 14-foot tall, bright-green chair is the perfect spot to take a series of funny graduation photos. Posing on top of the chair gives anyone who looks at the photo a chuckle as they squint to try and find you in the center of the behemoth sculpture.
Even just trying to haul yourself up onto the chair epitomizes the college experience, making the spot even more fitting for graduation photos. At first, you may really struggle to get your footing and figure out a way onto the giant lawn chair, but once you beat gravity to make your way up, the only appropriate way to capture the triumphant occasion is with a photoshoot.

Splurging on a bar of soap at Whole Foods from the Good Soap brand, who donates their profits to supporting people across the world, is a hygienic and charitable way to spend your last GWorld dollars.
The Class of 2023 isn’t the only thing leaving GW after commencement this year as GW’s GWorld-only dining plan will begin to filter into fewer and fewer students’ lives.
For more than 20 years while the University used the GWorld dollars meal plan, seniors have splurged to spend all of their remaining GWorld balance before graduation — after all, remaining dining dollars can’t roll over to another semester if there are no more semesters. But with the introduction of the Thurston and Shenkman dining halls this past year, GW students now have less GWorld money each semester, making the class of 2025 possibly the last group of seniors who will get to indulge the remains of their allotted GWorld money before they leave GW.
Rather than just finally ordering that slightly overpriced menu item one last time at a restaurant on GWorld, here are some uses for what remains of your GWorld money to make the most of the problem — or blessing — of having to spend what remains of your dining dollars.
Make a Whole Foods hygiene run
Along with the class of 2023, Whole Foods will be graduating from GWorld this May, as the grocery store will no longer accept dining dollars starting in June. Rather than spending all of one’s dining dollars on the newest plant-based meat substitute the supermarket sells, try splurging on some of the market’s soaps.
Whole Foods sells bars of soap from the Good Soap brand, who donates all of their profits to supporting people across the world through initiatives like providing education and pushing for fair wages in corporate America.
The soaps come in aesthetically pleasing rectangles with scents ranging from avocado to cherry blossom and subtle pastel colors matching the scent in question, like the light pink with bold, red streaks which decorates their cherry blossom soap. Squeeze one last visit into the grocery store and try a new soap to treat yourself to a self care and relaxation day before Commencement.
Give back to the community
After spending years living in the heart of the District, you could give back to the community by spending your remaining GWorld money on groceries and donating them to a food bank. A number of organizations across the District, including SOME (So Others Might Eat) and the Foggy Bottom-based Miriam’s Kitchen, accept food donations and use them to feed residents in need.
These organizations prefer donations of non-perishable goods, so you should consider spending your remaining GWorld on packages of rice and canned vegetables and then donate that food to one of the groups. Unspent GWorld money can also be donated to support The Store and the Abraham Family Fund, GW-led initiatives to prevent student hunger.
Though graduates cannot take GWorld with them, if you are looking for a way to make a lasting impact with their dining dollars, buying food and donating it to organizations in D.C. will improve the lives of people in need with the soon-to-disappear funds.
Donate your GWorld to research
One perpetual question plagues GW students when trying to find a place to eat — which GWorld vendor reigns supreme? Trying every single latte or every single burger on campus is expensive and time consuming, meaning for many it’s easier to rely on their first, tried and true option.
But if you’re looking to use up all your remaining GWorld, you could finally discover the uncontested best version of every comfort food, from dumplings to donuts. GW students for generations to come would surely appreciate the noble research efforts of someone trying each and every pepperoni pizza slice at GWorld vendors to see which the most delectable one is.
Pizza Movers and Calzones and Manny and Olga’s Pizza sit across the street from each other, are both on GWorld and claim to have the first jumbo slice in Georgetown. While remaining GWorld funds can’t answer which shop is telling the truth, they can be used to determine which has the better slice, giving graduating seniors a chance to settle the debate for future GW students by posting their findings to social media.
Party like it’s fall 2019
Embrace nostalgia and order food from a few restaurants which are no longer on GWorld. While this may seem counterintuitive, GrubHub offers students the ability to pay for their orders using GWorld dining dollars, giving graduating seniors the chance to get food from their favorite ex-GW staples.
Former staples of District House, like Chick-fil-A, Sol Mexican Grill and GRK, which officials removed from the food court this past year, still have D.C. locations in areas close to campus like Penn Quarter and Dupont Circle. The Class of 2023 can order themselves one last fully stuffed quesadilla to remember all those awkward freshman year lunches with someone you just met in your introduction to international politics lecture.
Gift a friend some #OnlyatGW merch
While you might want to give your fellow graduating friends a gift before you all go your separate ways, finding a present which connects to your time together at GW can be time consuming — and expensive. Rather than spend hours browsing D.C. gift shops, spend your last bit of GWorld cash on some merch from your friend’s favorite GW eatery as a present.
Grilled cheese specialist GCDC sells eye-catching, cheese-colored gold shirts and sweatshirts ($25) showing off the store’s name and it’s location in the heart of the District. If you aren’t able to make a trip to the grilled cheese bar, they even sell them on GrubHub for the cheese fanatic in your life.
If your friends prefer an early morning flavor and tapioca-filled tea, get them a shirt ($29.99) from SecreTea using your remaining funds. The shirts come in three colors — pink, white and black — each showing off a different endearing design, like the pink shirt which features someone drinking bubble tea with a smiling strawberry. The shirts are also available on GrubHub for a small extra fee ($30.29).

A visit to the freshman year staple nightclub Decades, located at 1219 Connecticut Ave. NW, is sure to have your parents busting a move to the oldies on one of the club's six throwback-themed floors.
While planning out itineraries for commencement week, graduating seniors will typically show family members the G-rated version of their lives, but even parents need a break from nonstop visits to the Smithsonian and walks along the reflecting pool. 
Seniors, please remember that after the third time of viewing the Lincoln Memorial, sober, the statue is simply a large marble man sitting down. So for a change of pace from basically doing the “National Treasure” walking tour, take your parents on the most sacred D.C. college experience — club hopping.
The Hatchet planned a night out for you and your family that will either bring you all closer together than ever or make your parents regret letting you come to the gritty big city. This outing will not be for the faint of heart, though, and likely in the wise words of Amy Poehler in “Mean Girls,” isn’t meant for regular moms, only “cool moms” — and dads.
Start the night off at a slower pace by taking them to Residents Cafe & Bar, a festively decorated eatery with blooming cherry blossoms dangling from the ceiling, nestled in the heart of Dupont Circle and conveniently located between several nightclubs. Ease your relatives into the party mood with one of their specialty cocktails, perhaps an espresso martini ($17) to help the older folks caffeinate for a long night of drinking festivities. 
Their dinner menu has a mix of elevated classic American staples like the dry-aged beef burger ($19) as well as a fusion of Mediterranean, Italian and French offerings. Consider splitting a few smaller bites like the snackable mini gyros ($14) or the spring pea croquettes ($11), which will settle their stomach before the night of drinking ahead.
Once the whole family is in high spirits, the night can truly begin. Head over to the Mayflower Club located at 1223 Connecticut Ave. NW, a combined lounge and restaurant with a storied past as a speakeasy that GW alum Antonis Karagounis reopened in 2021. Lovingly named after Zachariah “Zebbie” Goldsmith, who opened the Mayflower Club in 1933 and was arrested during Prohibition, the club’s main attraction, Zebbie’s Garden, is located on the third floor of the building. 
Zebbie’s Garden has disco balls and cherry blossoms cascading over a faux grass dance floor, where your parents can dance or snap pictures that will make their Facebook friends jealous. Open Thursday from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. and Friday through Saturday 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., the club offers a variety of musical performances rotating on a weekly basis.
If your parents are still feeling good and thriving after the first two locations and feel prepared for their #onlyatGW experience, return to the holy grail for freshmen who were too nervous to invest in a fake ID — Decades. Located next door to the Mayflower Club, this six-floor throwback-themed establishment might as well be a G-PAC requirement because so many GW students begin their college careers there. 
Let your parents choose their own adventure and experiment until they discover for themselves which Decades floor matches their vibe, just as you once did. They’ll likely gravitate toward one of the floors spinning ‘80s staples, so don’t be shocked if they insist on throwing down to some oldies. Or, reveal your inner club rat to them and point them toward your favorite floor and recount your horror stories in Decades. 
If the throngs of underclassmen moshing prove to be too much for your loved ones to keep up with, head over to Mad Hatter DC, whose youthful “Alice In Wonderland” decorations like psychedelic portraits of the Cheshire Cat contrast with its older demographic. 
From Thursday to Saturday, 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., their in-house DJ spins everything from ’80s classics to top 40 hits, so bring the parents along for an epic night of mash-ups and dancing. Let loose on the dance floor underneath an enormous metallic top hat and then quench your thirst together at the bar with their signature Hatter’s “Turquoise Rum Punch” ($40) served in, you guessed it, a glass top hat.
After all that dancing, your hangry parents will be desperate for some late-night bites. Luckily Surfside Dupont, a boardwalk-style taco stand filled to the brim with comfort food and refreshing beverages, is open 24 hours a day and is a short walk away. Gorge on chips and pineapple mango salsa while your parents dish on their favorite parts of the night. Who knows — you might even awaken the party animal that’s been in hibernation all these years.

Luke was a gentle and kind presence who brought a smile into every room he entered, and we’re proud to call him a friend.
We at The Hatchet are sad to announce that rising junior Luke Wienecke — The Hatchet’s beloved sports editor — died Friday in Oklahoma City. He was 20.
Luke was a gentle and kind presence who brought a smile into every room he entered, and we’re proud to call him a friend.
Luke would regularly check in on each individual member of staff when he entered The Hatchet’s 21st Street townhouse. In those many caring interactions, he would always be the first to crack a joke, offer witty insight or check in with his peers and friends. There is not a single staff member whom his warmth did not touch.
A political science major, Luke joined The Hatchet his freshman year and immediately excelled as one of the most talented journalists at GW. He deployed wit, tenacity and compassion in everything he did, from interviews and writing to fact-checking and editing.
Luke began his time at The Hatchet covering sports, bringing the vital stories of athletes, coaches and teams to the GW community. With every story, he showed his versatility as a reporter, covering anything and everything GW sports, including games, community initiatives and athletics department programs. He has said over the past year and a half, basketball and volleyball grew to be his favorites.
Luke’s prowess wasn’t limited to sports — he helped cover essential news about the operations of student government over the course of the past year, adding to his more than 40 sports bylines.
Luke was scrupulous and tireless fact checker, taking the time to make sure the stories The Hatchet published were not only accurate, but fair.
As a budding editor, Luke took every opportunity to teach others. He was relentless in his pursuit to improve sports coverage at The Hatchet and patient with every reporter, staff writer and editor who had the pleasure of working with him.
Outside of The Hatchet, Luke interned with Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt and U.S. Rep. Tom Cole.
His family has encouraged donations to the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance of Oklahoma. The Hatchet has started a GoFundMe for the alliance and started it with a $300 donation to the cause, and we hope to continue to honor the legacy of Luke, our dear friend.
The Hatchet is working on an obituary for Luke, which will be published in the coming days. If you would like to share any memories or photos of Luke, please email us at eic@gwhatchet.com.

Members of Climate Defiance, a nonprofit activism organization, sit before Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and CNN host Dana Bash on the stage of Betts Theatre.
Anti-fossil fuel protesters called for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to become a “climate leader” in an onstage sit-in during her book talk at Dorothy Betts Marvin Theatre in the University Student Center Thursday.
At least 10 members of Climate Defiance, a nonprofit that uses “disruptive direct action” to bring awareness to climate issues, occupied the stage for about seven minutes during a discussion for Klobuchar’s new memoir, chanting “Live your values, be a climate leader,” and linking arms while holding a banner that read “Amy: which side are you on?” Individuals interrupted the discussion twice and asked Klobuchar to commit to cosponsoring the Green New Deal before other protesters interspersed throughout the audience marched onstage.
Some members of the audience yelled at the occupants to leave during their protest. At least five GW Police Department officers responded to the protest onstage and escorted the group out of the theater after seven minutes of protest. 
University spokesperson Julia Metjian did not immediately return a request for comment regarding why officers escorted protesters out of the building.
The first attendee interrupted Klobuchar’s discussion on her book “The Joy of Politics,” which CNN host Dana Bash moderated, by asking if she would pledge to stop oil drilling in Minnesota. Klobuchar said “we don’t have drilling” in the state and that she was “proud” U.S. Congress passed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which set goals to reduce carbon emissions and promote clean energy.
“I’m a strong believer in even exceeding those goals, and there are many things we have to do to get there,” Klobuchar said. “I appreciate your advocacy.”
There is no drilling or other “oil or gas activity” in Minnesota due to “limited” crude oil and natural gas reserves in the state, according to Ballotpedia.
Another attendee stood up from their seat about four minutes after the first interruption and asked Klobuchar if she would co-sponsor the Green New Deal. Klobuchar responded to the question, saying she has a “very good” record on voting for climate change measures but did not state she would cosponsor the legislation. Immediately after her response, protesters took to the stage.
Klobuchar introduced a bill in March with Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) to make E15 gas available year-round, which could cause increased levels of ozone smog and pose a health risk. Klobuchar also introduced a bill incentivizing production of energy-efficient, affordable heat pumps for water heaters in May 2022.
Protesters stood up from their seats in the audience and marched on stage while chanting. Once on stage, demonstrators unfurled two banners while linking arms and sitting down directly in front of Klobuchar and Bash. Two GWPD officers immediately walked on stage and stood next to the demonstrators, who began to sing “Amy, which side are you on?” amid boos from members of the audience.

Shortly after protesters began to sing onstage, Klobuchar and Bash stood up from their seats and went backstage. Three more GWPD officers walked onstage and a man affiliated with the event asked protesters to leave, after which officers escorted the demonstrators off the stage and out of the building.
Klobuchar and Bash returned to the stage after the anti-fossil fuel demonstrators exited the building, receiving applause from the audience.
“It’s something we really do have to do more on,” Klobuchar said after sitting down. “They are right.”
After returning to the stage, two other attendees interrupted Klobuchar from the audience three more times. One man approached the stage and questioned Klobuchar about her legislative actions to increase gun safety about seven minutes after the discussion resumed.
Klobuchar said she would ban the purchase of assault weapons, enhance background checks and impose magazine limits. She said she feels “strongly” about improved gun control and met with a mother of a survivor of the shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville that killed three children and three school officials in March. 
GWPD officers then escorted the protester out of the building. 
About eight minutes after the protester was escorted out, another man stood up from his seat and criticized Klobuchar for her December 2016 trip to Ukraine before GWPD officers escorted him out of the theater.
Klobuchar said her 2016 trip to Ukraine with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and former Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was to show that America was “standing with” the country against Russian aggression as a “fellow democracy.”
The two protesters later returned and approached the stage. GWPD officers escorted them out again. EMeRG responders later wheeled one protester off the premises on a stretcher and Metropolitan Police Department officers transported the other protester to the second district station, according to an MPD spokesperson.

Lisner Auditorium hosted the star-studded Georgey Awards Tuesday, where athletes were honored for academic achievements, community service and memorable performances over the last year.
Senior gymnast Libby Garfoot, junior runner Kevin Conlon, senior runner Miles Grant, senior guard Nya Lok and sophomore swimmer Dara Reyblat hosted the ceremony that recognized both team excellence and individual accomplishments. In the show’s 11th year, the annual Georgey Awards Show includes athletes from all Colonial sports dressing up to celebrate their achievements during the past season. 
Men’s and women’s swim and dive were the biggest winners, sweeping both Athlete of the Year awards and the Team of the Year awards after the men’s swim and dive won the Atlantic 10 Championship for their third-straight year and the women’s swim and dive team won their second year in a row.
“On behalf of the women’s swim and dive team, we just want to say thank you to all the coaches for their constant support,” junior swimmer Marlee Rickert said. “And also for the men’s team because we wouldn’t be a complete team without you guys. We are truly a combined program.”
Sophomore swimmer Julia Knox, who was the first female GW swimmer to qualify for the NCAA regional championship since 1995, was named female Athlete of the Year and graduate student swimmer Marek Osina was awarded the male Athlete of the Year award.
Osina brought home gold medals in both the 200-meter individual medley and the 200-meter breaststroke events on his way to scoring the most individual points in the team’s A-10 title run. Freshman Phoebe Wright grabbed another award for the swimming team, winning Rookie of the Year. Wright’s 53-point performance at the conference championships tied Knox for the highest on the team, and she now holds the program record for the 200-yard backstroke.
Redshirt freshman guard Maximus Edwards also notched the Georgey for Rookie of the Year after becoming the first GW men’s basketball player to be named A-10 Rookie of the Year since 2000, when SirValiant Brown took home the honor. 
The award ceremony was interspersed with “Sport Swap” segments played on Lisner’s big screen that featured GW athletes trying their hand at sports outside their own. Senior women’s basketball center Mayowa Taiwo showed off her volleyball skills and sophomore volleyball setter Grace Allread and junior men’s soccer defender Lucas Matuszewski had a juggling competition — and it was pretty close.
Taiwo was awarded for her basketball skills, taking home the Red Auerbach Award for well-rounded excellence. The senior is returning for a graduate season after leading the A-10 in offensive rebounds and earning a spot on the Conference All-Defensive Team. 
“I want to thank everyone who voted for me for this award,” Taiwo said in her acceptance speech. “This would not be possible without my teammates, my coaches, staff and everyone who had helped me through this process.”
Graduate student and guard Brendan Adams accepted the Red Auerbach Award on the men’s side coming off his final year of collegiate basketball where he was named A-10 Most Improved player. Adams, who spent his senior and graduate seasons with the Colonials, ranked second in both points and assists for the squad this past season, helping propel them to their best regular season finish since 2017.
The Georgey for Academic Team of the Year went to women’s tennis, who topped all programs in cumulative GPA over the last two semesters with a 3.66 average.
Ethan Tulenko won the Raise High our Community Student-Athlete award for his community service work with the Morningside, Maryland volunteer fire department. Rower and former Hatchet reporter Celeste Noraian, who works educating local middle school students about health curricula, also won the Raise High community service award. 
The event included a tribute to outgoing interim University President Mark Wrighton, where junior men’s basketball center Keegan Harvey and senior swimmer Oscar Madsen took the stage to thank Wrighton for his “incredible support” of GW athletics.
“President Wrighton, I’ll never forget looking into the stands and seeing you wearing a George’s Army T-shirt and wearing a wig,” Harvey said. “Truly an only at GW moment.”
Senior Ryan Puelo, this year’s president of George’s Army, was given the Georgey for Fan of the Year.
One athlete from each team was named MVP of their respective squad. The women’s team MVPs went to graduate student runner Yukino Parle, graduate student gymnast Deja Chambliss, freshman lacrosse midfielder Stella Ray, graduate student rower Alexa Nealy, graduate student striker Rachel Sorkenn, freshman pitcher Rose Cano, freshman swimmer Julia Knox, junior tennis players Stella Wiesemann and Gabriela Giraldo and senior middle blocker Addie Feek.
The men’s team MVPs included senior guard James Bishop, senior runner Ryan Fowkes, senior soccer player Tom Cooklin, redshirt junior swimmer Djurdje Matic, graduate student and water polo player Theodoros Pateros and senior golfer Jakub Hrinda.

James Tate is the chief of police for the GW Police Department.
I have had the opportunity to hear and learn from many members of our community over the past few weeks in the wake of the University’s announcement regarding reimagining public safety. These conversations have been productive, and they are helping to shape our implementation plans as we prepare to arm GWPD’s supervisory officers.
I fully appreciate that members of our community have varied reactions to this announcement based on their own lived experiences and identities. And, to be clear, gaining a thorough understanding of our students’ concerns — and specific feedback and suggestions — is tremendously valuable and essential as we develop an implementation plan for arming GWPD’s supervisory officers. It’s also critical that we continue our ongoing engagement with our students, faculty, staff and neighbors so that we account for the varying perspectives of our diverse stakeholders moving forward.
Much of the feedback we’ve received from students underscores the need for this ongoing engagement and communication. In the past few weeks, I have received many questions from our community about circumstances that would involve an armed officer’s response, whether armed officers would be in residence halls and training requirements for such officers.
These are excellent questions reflecting important concerns — some are related to the training and preparedness of our supervisory officers, and others are centered around the impact of this change on the daily life and culture of our Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses. Let me address these two areas.
We will require all of GWPD’s armed officers to undergo extensive training requirements. Prior to arming, officers will be required to successfully complete an accredited police academy and an additional 56-hour firearms course that includes training regarding less lethal and nonlethal force and police accountability. These standards are the same as those for other police officers in our area.
We also will require supervisors to regularly demonstrate proficiency with their firearm and attend in-service training on defensive tactics, use-of-force policies, de-escalation skills and — perhaps most critically to many of our community members — implicit bias. We have recruited our supervisory officers from other law enforcement agencies, and they have distinguished and honorable careers. Among the group are former detectives, police academy instructors, school resource officers and individuals with specialized experience, like from the FBI academy and through many aspects of law enforcement training.
We’ve also modified our response to mental health calls and will continuously evaluate how we can improve moving forward. All officers, including supervisors, wear body-worn cameras, which contribute to building trust and accountability. We will consider feedback from our community about any crucial components of our trainings and share more information in our implementation plans.
We are developing our protocols regarding armed officer response in various situations, including when they may need to respond to a residence hall. We will share more about these protocols in our implementation plans.
Of course, I recognize that many of you have perspectives on how we best support the safety of our community, and I acknowledge that these perspectives are vital and based on your experiences and identities. My dual identities as a member of law enforcement and a man of color impact the way I view this matter and its importance. I also understand that our diverse community members’ many identities and lived experiences impact your perspectives on policing, arming officers and its implications. I will continue to acknowledge and work to understand these perspectives and address any concerns.
It is my privilege to serve as chief of GWPD. Since joining GW, I have had the pleasure of meeting with many members of our community, especially our students. Our officers have also worked to increase accountability, offer transparency and earn trust among our stakeholders. The core of this work at GW has been building engagement with our community. This engagement is essential to our work and will continue.
We are sharing information with the community at go.gwu.edu/publicsafety. I look forward to finding more ways to engage with our community members — I assure you, my door is always open.
