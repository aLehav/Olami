Predicting another year of Greek life growth, GW’s Panhellenic Association has added an extra day to its fall recruitment.
Potential new members, who must meet with all 11 Panhellenic chapters, will have two nights instead of one to visit all chapters.
“The calendar lent itself to [the five-day model],” Panhellenic staff adviser Marcus Williams said, “so we decided to push forward with the opportunity to try something a little different.”
The move comes as GW’s 11th chapter, Kappa Delta, officially joins the Panhellenic Association on Feb. 10.
Recruitment will begin Sept. 19 – about four weeks into the semester and in line with recruitment in fall 2010 and 2011. Sororities will hand out bids on Sept. 24.
Panhel had originally considered kicking off during Labor Day weekend, but the association’s president Rachael Abram said she worried about freshmen having just a week at GW to decide whether to go through recruitment.
Because many students hail from the Northeast where Greek affiliation is a less traditional part of college life, Abram said many students do not arrive on campus planning to go Greek.
Unlike most urban campuses, about 25 percent of GW’s student body takes part in social Greek life.  At similar urban schools like New York and Boston universities, less than 2 percent and 6 percent of students belong to chapters, respectively.
“We have a lot of girls who are making last-minute decisions to go Greek,” Abram said. Many women change their minds about Greek life after arriving at GW and meeting sorority members, she added.
Sigma Delta Tau president Liel Azoolin said she was pleased recruitment would begin in September, rather than this year’s October start. She added that holding it a few weeks into the semester “will give freshmen enough time to get used to GW and decide if they want to join a sorority.”
The five-day process mimics recruitment at schools with larger Greek life populations, which freshman Zoe Colgin said would allow freshmen to get a better sense of each sorority’s personality before accepting bids.
“Having it spread out may make it less of a stressful process,” Colgin, who joined Sigma Kappa, said this year. “[Potential new members] won’t have 11 sororities crammed into their heads in one fell swoop.”
Recruitment last fall began Oct. 5 due to scheduling conflicts with Jewish holidays and the Freshman Day of Service.
Chapters also handed out about 20 percent fewer bids last fall, with some women choosing to join the newest sorority, Kappa Delta, which held its own new member process.

Editor’s note: This is the second column in a series on mental health at GW. 
Everyone knows that getting an appointment at the University Counseling Center isn’t easy.
For over a year, the UCC has been under scrutiny, to the extent that it hired a new director with expertise as both a leader and a psychologist. And the center has also offered six free sessions since September 2011, even though it’s costly for the University.
But mental health issues still persist – both at GW and across the country.
Two-thirds of college students who need mental health assistance don’t get it, and 44 percent of college students report having felt “so depressed in the past year it was difficult to function,” according to Active Minds, a national organization geared toward fighting the stigma surrounding mental health on college campuses.
And the Student Health Service is also widely used for mental health care. Last semester, there were 597 visits to GW’s staff psychiatrists, according to University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard.
But if the counseling center wants to reach as many students as possible, it needs to make significant structural changes.
Any institution of higher education should always be on the lookout to make its services student-accessible. And by and large, that is the case at GW. Our bookstore is conveniently located on the same floor of the Marvin Center where students can pay their tuition bills and pick up transcripts. There are mailboxes in each residence hall, and Package Services Center promptly sends students emails when they receive packages.
But students can’t see a University psychologist and pick up anti-depressants under the same roof. And that should change.
Student Health Service – which houses GW’s three staff psychiatrists, who can prescribe medication – is located at 2141 K St. The University Counseling Center, which houses psychologists and social workers who work with students coping with issues like anxiety and depression, has offices at 2033 K St.
While this distance may seem trivial, it doesn’t make sense to send students who need medication from a psychiatrist to a different building to get a prescription: This should be something that also falls under the counseling center’s jurisdiction.
The stratification of mental health services at GW is frustrating and even discouraging. On an issue as pressing and significant as this one, which affects hundreds of GW students each day, we should take care to ensure that mental health offerings are as accessible as possible.
GW’s UCC and SHS are far from obsolete. In fact, their usage has steadily increased over the past few years, and the UCC reported a 25 percent uptick in first-time clients between the fall of 2010 and 2011.
In fact, usage was so high that The Hatchet reported Sept. 24  that waiting times to obtain a preliminary appointment at SHS were sometimes a staggering six weeks.
Granted, the delay has subsided – wait times are only about one week now, according to University Spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard – but its services are still popular.
In a culture that sometimes frowns upon those who seek help for mental illness, the fact that students use these services is reassuring. And that should drive the momentum to improve them.
Grouping psychiatrists in offices that today house only psychologists might seem like a formality. But in fact, it could be an important catalyst to getting students the mental health treatment they need.
Combining these departments is the logical thing to do – and other universities agree. Georgetown, Boston and New York universities all combine their psychologists and psychiatrists in the same office.
After there were six student suicides between 2003 and 2004 at NYU, the institution took a stand on mental health by overhauling its program, which included, among other things, keeping many services under one roof.
It’s time for GW to look toward doing the same. And the director of the counseling center, Silvio Weisner, was hired away from a college that does just this.
Nagmeh Merck, the interim director at Marymount University’s counseling center, explained to me that while its on-staff psychiatrist is technically not an employee of the counseling center, her patients share their waiting room, and she holds sessions in the center’s offices. Merck believes that offering both types of mental health services under one roof is beneficial for their patients because they only have to make one stop to get the help they need.
“It is very effective, because obviously they are seamless services,” she said, adding that counselors hold weekly meetings with the psychiatrist about their shared patients.
Weisner told me in an email that psychologists at GW meet with the university psychiatrist at least once a month, or otherwise as needed.
GW has hundreds more students than Marymount, and yet, counterintuitively, GW’s interdepartmental communication is far less frequent.
Weisner should look to make changes at GW that reflect practices from his former employer by housing psychiatry and psychology services together. Doing so would streamlines the process to receive mental assistance and inevitably facilitate more communication between the departments – which can only help students.
There was another school shooting Jan. 22, this time on a college campus outside Houston. Fortunately, none of the four people hospitalized were killed, but one of the gun holders was carrying a Lone Star College ID.
This wasn’t the first school shooting conducted by a college-aged individual, nor will it be the last. It can and will happen anywhere.
In the wake of gun violence across the country, institutions from elementary schools to the federal government are considering how best to accommodate students with mental health issues.
It’s an impetus for GW to do so as well.

Don’t look now – there’s still a large portion of the season to go – but the Colonials may have tallied their most complete victory of the Mike Lonergan era Saturday.
GW’s 82-54 victory against Charlotte did more than just surpass the team’s single-game points total for this season. And it did more than extend the team’s win streak to three games. It was a statement win, a feel-good victory that came with the most balanced attack the team has presented all season.
It was also a victory over the team tied for first place in the Atlantic 10. It was a win that moved GW (10-9, 4-2 A-10) into the top tier of the conference, positioning the team well for the coming months of league play that will determine a bid and seeding in postseason competition.
“This one was fun. Especially on Coaches versus Cancer, suits and sneakers day. My mom and [my former coach] Jack Bruen died of cancer, so I told the guys before the game, the freshmen, I said, ‘I don’t want to assume you know what this is all about.’ And it’s important to me,” Lonergan said. “I said, ‘You should play for whoever in your life is fighting cancer or passed away.’ ”
After an opening lull, things began to click for the Colonials. The shots that were clanging off the rim began to fall, and GW took the lead with an 18-5 run. It was an advantage it would never relinquish, the team maintaining a comfortable distance from the 49ers throughout the rest of play.
With 17 assists on the game, it was a cohesive, unified Colonial offense that took the court Saturday afternoon. Running through freshman guard Joe McDonald, GW played through Charlotte’s traps and double teams, and remained calm in the face of the 49ers’ press. GW shot 53.2 percent, staying well above water despite turning the ball over 16 times against the team that’s first in the A-10 in field goal defense.
“We really want to play team ball. Move around, and not really stay stationary with the ball, and execute. So we wanted them to chase us and really have to play defense,” senior guard Lasan Kromah said. “We made a couple of good passes. Fortunately for us, we made them, and we just tried to stay consistent for the full 40 minutes.”
Charlotte’s frustration came through in the second half, as the foul calls ramped up. All in all, there were 45 total fouls on the game – and 31 of those came after the break.
It was another game that saw the scoring spread across the Colonial roster. Continuing its recent trend, GW’s bench torched the 49ers for 43 points. Kromah and senior guard Bryan Bynes led that charge, scoring 12 each. Kromah added five boards and three steals, while Bynes had four assists.
“We came in to really add a spark to the game,” Kromah said. “So us coming off the bench is big, we’re going against their bench. We have a lot of veteran guys coming off the bench, so we just come in and try to pick up the slack a bit.”
Members of the starting five, too, aided GW’s attack. Senior forward Isaiah Armwood had nine points, a block and eight rebounds, while freshman forward Patricio Garino had 16 points on 6-for-6 shooting to go along with four steals.
“We do have an unselfish team. Sometimes that can be a fault when you need a bucket and the shot clock’s down,” Lonergan said. “Our guys, our chemistry is good. They really like each other and they’re a fun team to coach.”
Earlier this season, when their shots just weren’t falling, GW often relied on its defense to keep it in the game. That experience paid off Saturday, as it held Charlotte to just 31.6 percent shooting on the game.
The Colonials controlled the baseline, outrebounding the 49ers 40-27.
It was an impressive feat against a team averaging 40 rebounds a game, and it completely disrupted Charlotte’s attack. Despite junior guard DeMario Mayfield’s 17 points, the 49ers had just six assists throughout play, unable to turn one player’s success into a unified offensive front.
“Charlotte’s having a great season. Their chemistry seems better this year, they’re winning with rebounding and defense and we felt that we had to really play tough today,” Lonergan said. “We did a great job on the boards. Some of our guards really got in there and rebounded, [who] normally we don’t get a lot of rebounds.”
When GW was last in Foggy Bottom on Jan. 16, it walked off the court after a gut-wrenching loss to Temple.
But the team got up off the mats. Riding a three-game win streak, the Colonials now turn their focus to facing La Salle Feb. 2, and maybe, just maybe, a continuation of their recent success over the rest of the A-10 season. A bid to Brooklyn seems closer now, the team learning to compete in a tougher Atlantic 10 that will only have slots for 12 of its 16 teams in the postseason.
“We found a way to win the close games, and that helped a lot,” Garino said. “Our confidence is pretty up right now.”

There were camouflaged U.S. Army trucks on Pennsylvania Avenue as security heightened in residence halls and thousands of visitors flocked to D.C. for President Barack Obama’s second inauguration. But the opportunity to witness the president’s inaugural speech and parade was well worth wading through the crowds. The excitement was palpable on the National Mall.
And despite the $9 drink prices and the steep $100 ticket price, GW’s Inaugural Ball gave new meaning to the “only at GW” catch phrase. There was ample food and students enjoyed dancing in the Omni Shoreham Hotel ballrooms.
Tulane University admitted in late December that its M.B.A. program sent inflated admissions data to U.S. News and World Report. The magazine unranked Tulane last week, two months after GW’s unranking for botching admissions data.
But unlike GW, Tulane pledged to release a comprehensive review of multiple years’ worth of admissions data, and officials there said the employee at fault was no longer on their staff. GW spent a month keeping Kathryn Napper – who led the admissions office for 15 years – out of the public eye as opposed to making her available for interviews. And five weeks after administrators disclosed that GW incorrectly calculated certain admissions data, they said she would retire at the end of the calendar year, but would not respond when asked if she was told to leave GW.
Administrators have said the Board of Trustees did not even ask auditors for a written report of the checks performed on admissions data after it realized that the information was incorrect. But The Hatchet’s editorial board hopes Tulane’s written report will be an impetus for GW to create and release its own.
Students were on their feet in the Smith Center Saturday afternoon as the men’s basketball team beat the Charlotte 49ers, who began the game tied for No. 1 in the A-10, 82-54. It was a huge win that capped a three-game streak for GW, the only Division I college basketball team that starts four true freshmen.
This momentum could not only mean an impressive finish to the season, but also fresh hope for seasons to come.
With the season still relatively young, and tournament play still far in the distance, it’s too soon to jump to conclusions. But GW is on a roll, and we’re looking forward to watching the rest of the season unfold. Raise high!
The GW School of Business announced plans this week to offer a bachelor’s degree for finance majors, which would in turn decrease the number of required business administration courses from 13 to three.
This would give finance majors more flexibility in their schedules, and students will have the option to take more courses of their own choosing.
After a series of complaints from professors in the business school about Dean Doug Guthrie’s leadership style last semester, it is encouraging to see the faculty getting behind an initiative that will give business students access to a broader education.

Correction appended
Mitchell Hall has seen flooding, leaks, fungus, broken ceilings and malfunctioning laundry machines this year.
In response to student complaints, advocates from the Student Association and the Residence Hall Association are pushing the University to deal with issues up the hall before fall move-in next year.
Sophomore Shani Shih said she found fungus growing on the ceiling of her third-floor bathroom last semester. FIXit responded after about a week.
“Mushrooms were basically growing on the wall in the bathrooms,” Shih said.
In the past two years, the University has taken steps to improve the 350-room building at 514 19th St. Several communal bathrooms and kitchens were renovated, and new furniture was added to the lobby.
But residents say they have continually faced problems.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to provide the number of FIXit requests reported across the University for the past semester, saying GW would not provide those numbers because “they can be misinterpreted and are classified in different ways.”
GW last provided FIXit numbers in October 2011, when students said they were frustrated with a backlog of requests.
Atalay Ozsoy, a fifth-year senior, said his Mitchell sink was overflowing to the point of flooding last semester, displacing him from the building until this month.
“They tried to move me back a couple of times, but I refused – the smell was that bad,” he said.
While 84-year-old Mitchell houses mostly sophomores, officials recently announced that transfer students would occupy about half of the rooms this August. SA Director of New Students Ari Massefski and RHA President Jacob Thayer said they want to spruce up the building for transfers, paying close attention to problems like air and heating systems, plumbing and laundry machines.
After housing assignments were doled out last year, several freshmen created a Facebook group where students complained about being forced to pay $9,250 yearly for a single room and a communal bathroom down the hall.
“I think that there is often a stigma on campus that Mitchell is not a good property to live in,” Thayer, a four-year resident of the building, said. “I think it’s underrated.”
Sophomore Max McGee said it took several days for GW to respond to a water leak in his bathroom, which he shares with more than a dozen students. McGee said the issue returned a few days later.
“I feel as though they just mopped up the water and didn’t fix the problem,” McGee said.
Junior Liz Schmit said she covered a hole in her ceiling with a garbage bag for two weeks before the University responded.
“I called them after a ceiling tile fell from my roof,” she said. “I had to call FIXit twice because I waited for about a week and they still hadn’t come.”
Special Adviser for Communications and Outreach John Ralls, who works in the facilities department, declined to provide information on potential laundry issues before publication time.
Massefski said living in Mitchell’s singles will be good for the transfer community, and he wants to make repairs before students arrive this fall.

Some students are struggling with a new class setup that forces them to teach themselves, using a professor as a coach, rather than a lecturer.
All introductory physics courses starting this month use a model dubbed “SCALE-UP,” in which students collaborate on class work instead of being instructed by a professor at the front of the room.
The change has injected more rigor into large classes, students and professors said, and the classrooms in Monroe and Tompkins halls have been destinations for GW tour guides to highlight innovative teaching. But some students say the switch is overwhelming and that professors offer little help.
Mckenzie Anderson, a sophomore international affairs major taking a SCALE-UP physics class this semester, said the class’s heavy emphasis on group work becomes “useless” because students aren’t prepared for it.
“Basically, for the two hours it’s the professor putting problems up on the board and students solving them in groups with very little guidance,” he said. “With this class, you pretty much rely on the book which makes it harder for students who aren’t as interested in the subject.”
The newly renovated rooms, equipped with audiovisual technology, usually hold about 80 students. About half of astronomy classes and some engineering departments also use the spaces.
Students said the classes lack structure and that coming to class under-prepared can mean an hour of feeling lost.
Junior Rachael Holbreich, an American studies major, said she’s been able to make the most of her physics class so far, but has seen others struggle.
“Realistically, there are students who come to class unprepared and have to play catch-up,” Holbreich said. “There’s definitely an adjustment to make if you’re used to lectures.”
For others, especially those who are studying technical fields, the model is a welcome change.
Freshman engineering major Daniel Soldau, who is enrolled in a calculus-based physics class, said the course was challenging, but more worthwhile than standard lectures.
“We might have been disappointed that we couldn’t go on Facebook, but we were glad that we were actually doing something with the time,” Soldau said. “From the people I’ve talked to, they like that the class is interactive.”
Teaching in SCALE-UP classrooms is a signature part of the University’s science and engineering plans. Some GW professors started using the model in 2008, and two years ago GW completed renovations to Monroe and Tompkins halls to carve out the more spacious classrooms.
Although most of the space in the Science and Engineering Hall, set to open in 2015, is dedicated to research laboratories, the classrooms in the $275 million building will follow the SCALE-UP model. The latest building plans call for two large SCALE-UP classrooms, and several smaller versions.
At GW, the switch was spearheaded by physics professor Gerald Feldman. The change has helped grow the University’s growing science and engineering foundation, he said.
The main draw, he added, is engaging students in working out complicated material themselves instead of relying on students to absorb the coursework in a lecture.
“If you have a lecture you have someone stand there and talk at you for 50 minutes. That has been proven to be almost totally ineffective. With SCALE-UP the instructor is much more like a coach. That’s the best analogy,” Feldman said.
He added that while the model helps both science and non-science majors, it could turn off students looking for an easier way to fill a general requirement.
“It makes you work harder for more gains, so I guess I can see that being why students complain,” he said. “The more you struggle, the more you construct your understanding.”

Fed up with what they call stalling efforts on the part of GW, Student Association leaders are pushing administrators to prioritize graduate student issues, saying the group is sometimes isolated and ignored.
SA President and Executive Vice President Ashwin Narla and Abby Bergren say they want to create a separate orientation program, a graduate student lounge – possibly in Gelman Library or the Marvin Center basement – and new policies allowing groups to serve alcohol at their events.
Groups of graduate students, who comprise almost 60 percent of GW, told staffers last year that they wanted a tighter community, better academic and career advising, and more study areas.
The findings, compiled by presidential administrative fellows, who are master’s candidates that receive full tuition to work for GW departments, were presented to administrators last April after a year of research, focus groups and surveys.
The University has made some headway on the plans, but ideas like the student council and orientation program remain years away, officials said.
“It’s something that’s important. It’s something the University has lagged behind on and it’s our job to push these processes forward,” Bergren, the SA’s executive vice president, said.
The Center for Student Engagement also outlined goals for graduate students last spring, like offering more graduate student programming, helping with child care services and increasing representation in advocacy organizations, based on its own research.
Last semester, CSE added a handful of career events for the Graduate School of Political Management but CSE director Tim Miller said taking additional steps is complex because students are in different stages of life with their careers and families.
He acknowledged that the University has mostly failed to connect with graduate students who have families and full-time careers.
“It’s hard to commit them to coming to things,” Miller said. “We’re building a community for the ones that aren’t going to go to the happy hour.”
CSE Director of Graduate, Distance, and Professional Student Experience Andrew Goretsky, said he is working to create a week-long orientation program, rather than the current half-day program. The current offering includes a welcome ceremony, a graduate student services fair and a meet-and-greet with officials.
Most of the changes are far off. Graduate student Elizabeth Barnett, who worked on the report, said “we should see some movement on all of them in the next few years.”
Creating a separate graduate student council, though far off, would mean about a 25 percent budget cut to the SA, Vice Chair of the SA’s Finance Committee Ryan Counihan said.
Graduate students get to keep about 75 percent of their student activity fees, going to organizations like the Student Bar Association, while the rest is doled out for University-wide events like Fall Fest. The SA’s budget is about $1 million a year.
SA Sen. Shashwat Gautam, SoB-G, said a graduate student committee could lessen tensions in the SA. It is hard for graduate senators to attend SA Senate meetings on Monday nights, which often coincide with their classes.
Narla agreed that the populations’ varying needs can make it tough to work on projects together.
“It definitely is difficult having undergraduates in the same room as graduates. It’s a hard relationship,” Narla said. “What we’re trying to do now is ask what can we do given the benefit of being together and make this work.”

The Watergate Hotel’s opening has been pushed back at least a year, with developers now looking to add rooftop terraces and summer gardens, worrying neighbors about outdoor noise.
Luxury developer Euro Capital Properties presented renovation plans last year, pledging to enliven the slumping complex and restore the hotel’s iconic reputation by this spring. The project will now cost developers $85 million, up from the previous estimate of $70 million.
And in the last month, developers have seen another potential holdup. Neighbors have jeopardized the hotel’s application for a liquor license by calling attention to issues of noise from the new outdoor spaces.
“Neighbors want to make sure that these new additions to the hotel do not have a negative impact on their homes and their property value and their value of life,” Asher Corson, who sits on the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, said at a meeting earlier this month.
The Watergate Hotel changed owners several times between the 1980s and 2007, when the building shut down for a proposed $170 million renovation. But the remodeling plans fell through and the hotel sat empty until Euro Capital Properties bought the space for $45 million in 2010.
The following year the company proposed to add more than 100 rooms to the building and redesign its ballroom. Corson said Euro Capital Properties principal Jacques Cohen caught neighbors off guard when he showed them blueprints for the gardens, which were not included in initial plans, a few weeks before the ANC meeting.
“Without the garden, we’re not a resort. We’re just one of the many hotels in D.C.,” Cohen said. “In order to really make this work, we have to make real reasons for people to come to the Watergate and what the complex has is those beautiful water views.”
Residents of the Watergate buildings, who only expected alcohol to be served indoors, are concerned noise will travel into apartments overlooking the outdoor patios.
The ANC, which has a say in matters like restaurant permits and city rules, said it would oppose the hotel’s application until Cohen negotiates with neighbors who live closest to the hotel. The group agreed to withdraw its protest once every building hammers out a formal, written agreement with the company.
Corson, an alumnus, added that the ANC often protests liquor license requests, ensuring neighbors make agreements with the applicants and have their concerns included in Alcohol Beverage Regulation Administration documents.
Euro Capital Properties’ portfolio includes luxury hotels like D.C.’s Hamilton Crowne Plaza and the Hilton Arc de Triomphe Paris.
“We want to see the hotel be successful,” said Armando Irizarry, who represents the Watergate complex on the ANC. “But there are concerns that are legitimate.”

College students from across the country descended on D.C. Friday during the March for Life, an annual protest of the landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade, on its 40th anniversary.
The bulk of the thousands of ralliers appeared to be college students, shouting “pro-life” and chants like “Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Roe v. Wade has got to go!”
More than 600 University of Notre Dame students took a 12-hour bus ride into the District for the march. Notre Dame Junior John Ryan, a second-time march participant, said it was his college’s largest turnout yet.
He called overturning the Supreme Court decision “the most important cause of our generation,” and said this year’s protest, coming after an election that voted against several key anti-abortion measures, was more charged.
The issue surfaced on the presidential campaign as well, as a media-labeled “War on Women” polarized candidates like Mitt Romney.
Still, many in the crowd say the anti-abortion lobby is the strongest it has ever been, giving hope to conservatives hoping to close in on the law’s reversal.
“Hopefully, this is the last time we have to come,” Ryan said.
Thousands brought home-made signs bearing slogans like, “Conceived by Rape, Love my Life” and showcasing photographs of children of teenage moms.
Among the crowd from GW was senior Rosemary Holt, co-president of the leading anti-abortion group on campus, Colonials for Life. Holt went to the march for the first time this year.
“It was a very powerful moment that really energized me to keep the good fight going,” Holt said, adding that it was important to advocate for what she said were “unborn children” who could not speak for themselves.
Holt said her beliefs are scarcely represented on GW’s campus. Almost 70 percent of students said they backed President Barack Obama last November, according to a Hatchet poll of more than 600 students across campus.
Colonials for Life draws attention with its weekly protests, which Holt leads, outside an on-campus abortion clinic.
Born to a teenage mother, Holt said she does not shy away from her stance on the issue around other students while standing in front of the F Street clinic beside the Dakota residence hall.
“Just because I have the right to do what I want with my body does not mean I can kill somebody,” Holt said.
The rally before the march saw influential anti-abortion rights speakers, including congressman Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who famously called Obama the “abortion president,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and former Pennsylvania senator and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum.
GW senior Lana Schommer, a three-time attendee of the march, said she was in part propelled to stand up against abortion because she lives in liberal-leaning D.C. Schommer said she is hopeful for change, but feels that it will be a long time before the fight is over.
“This is the kind of stuff that all these great peace leaders are doing. We’re just trying to impact change,” Schommer said.
‘This is still an issue to us’ 
Just a few days before the March for Life, about 50 people gathered in front of the Supreme Court.
In the four decades after the Supreme Court decision, some states like Oklahoma, Michigan and South Dakota have mounted campaigns to make abortions illegal.
The topic became prominent in the 2012 election, with Democrats highlighting women’s issues and Republicans fighting against abortion.
Some abortion rights organizations, like the National Organization for Women, have been reinvigorated by comments like the “legitimate rape” statement made by Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., last fall. The ousted  representative said women who encounter “legitimate rape” rarely become pregnant.
Advocates outside the court donned buttons and stickers. Women in their 70s stood next to six students from the GW Feminist Student Union.
“We want to show collectively as women and as people who support access to health care and access to safe legal abortions that this is still an issue to us,” Elizabeth Settoducato, co-chair of the GW Feminist Society, said.
Settoducato said she wants to see the “stigma” of getting an abortion erased, but added that “it’s probably not going to happen.”
Participants from as far as San Francisco marched with large signs crying “Keep Abortion Legal” and chanting, “Abortion on demand and without apology” and “Keep  your rosaries out of my ovaries.” During the hour-long rally, a man heckled the marchers calling abortion “a modern holocaust.”
Anne Schwartz, co-chair of the GW Feminist Society, added that even 40 years after the landmark decision, there is still a large backlash against a woman’s reproductive rights.
“It was very exciting for us to meet and protest with other feminists and to be reminded again that the fight isn’t over,” Schwartz said.
Speakers rallied the troops, wrapped in scarves and coats, as temperatures dipped as low as 5 degrees.
A ‘social rights’ issue
While women have more seats in Congress than ever, abortion rights leaders lament that male leaders make up most of the decision-makers on the issue.
At the abortion rights rally, more than a dozen men attended, including GW freshman Eric Wolfert. Wolfert cited congressional candidates like Akin, who have attacked women’s reproductive rights.
“We need to elect candidates that will stand up for women’s health and reproductive rights,” he said. “As someone who will never be pregnant, I cannot in any good conscience decide what is best for women in that situation.”
But junior Chris Crawford, GW Catholics director of Pro-Life Ministry, said it is not a gender issue, but a social rights issue. Crawford said he stands up not against women, but for unborn children.
Men like Crawford made up about half the crowd at the March for Life. Husbands stood by their wives, fathers held their children and young men cheered with their fellow churchgoers and classmates to support the anti-abortion movement.
“Men should be helping women and should be there for women throughout the entire process,” Crawford said. “We all have a part today in protecting life at all stages. Men are not exempt from this responsibility.”

A Foggy Bottom resident is blasting GW for lax off-campus housing policies that he says are failing to preserve peace in the neighborhood.
Kenneth Durham called the University’s police presence, trash pick-up and disciplinary policies for students living off-campus inadequate compared to neighboring Georgetown University, outlining differences between about a dozen Georgetown and GW policies in a community email thread last week.
Pointing to mandatory housing contracts, an off-campus orientation program and weekend evening police patrols, Durham wrote that Georgetown, which has a long history of strife between students and neighbors, “does more to prevent problems before they occur.”
GW began cracking down on rowdy student behavior in the last few years as neighbor complaints escalated. For the past two years, GW has distributed “welcome bags,” which include information about student conduct policies, to students living off-campus.
Last year, the University Police Department responded to about 75 concerns from neighbors, mostly noise-related – down from 86 incidences the year before.
But tensions flared last fall, when neighbors compiled a list of noisy student-rented townhouses along New Hampshire Avenue.
“These students would not shout and yell in the Kennedy Center or at [Kinkead’s], but for some reason, they are left with the impression that they can disturb people in a residential neighborhood,” Durham said. “Foggy Bottom consists of children, people who have to go to work early in the morning, people who are sick and need their rest.”
Durham studied both GW and Georgetown policies on concerns like noise, vandalism, litter and trash, and mainly criticized GW’s lack of patrols.
While UPD runs a 24-hour hotline fielding neighbor complaints,  Georgetown hires private security officers to patrol neighborhoods between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. weekend nights, according to a school website.
Georgetown also takes harsher action against students violating off-campus rules.
If officials see excessive trash,  improper recycling or students putting out trash too early for pickup, the house will be fined and residents given community service hours. The fines start at $150 per house for the first violation, according to the Off-Campus Student Life website.
Students can also be fined for improper lawn care or for failing to remove snow and ice from sidewalks.
 Durham said he has met with the University’s community relations office several times each year for the past six years. He added that while most students do not cause friction with neighbors, there are still late-night parties that appear to host up to 100 guests.
Some students also throw objects off balconies, vandalize private property or fail to properly dispose of trash.
In October, other neighbors helped Durham replant flowers after students tore them off his fence, destroyed a sculpture and flipped over a picnic table. The plants were stolen later in the day.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said GW’s community team takes the issue of rowdy students seriously, and added that the number of complaints is down.
“While the university recognizes that even one off-campus incident can be disruptive to our neighbors, the university’s annual report shows notable decreases in recent years in these types of disruptive behavior,” Sherrard wrote in an email.
