Head Coach Gregg Ritchie brought on three new coaches for the upcoming season. 
Baseball is seeking both an Atlantic 10 title and an NCAA playoff berth this season.
The Colonials are preparing to make a run at the A-10 Championship after capturing the most wins in their division last season and finishing with an overall record of 26-18, just narrowly missing the A-10 playoffs. As Head Coach Gregg Ritchie begins his 10th season, he said he believes team success comes down to two factors – attitude and effort.
“Attitude and effort is everything,” Ritchie said. “Because whatever character you think you possess, if you’re not getting something done, and you’re kind of off the beaten path, then you can directly look back to, ‘Is my attitude right, and is my effort right?’”
Ritchie said he hopes to use senior experience to set an example and facilitate team culture for the 15 new players added to the roster this season. He said there is plenty of leadership among the returners, including both leaders by example and more vocal leaders.
Among the roster additions are 13 freshmen and two graduate student transfers in outfielder Michael Ludowig and left-handed pitcher Johnathan Brus. Senior outfielder Cade Fergus said the team prides itself on the inclusion of its first-year members.
“We all try to make sure that we share the things we’ve learned through our experiences and make sure they’re ready to go right away because Coach Ritchie is not scared to play freshmen or a first year right away,” Fergus said. “We could say that from firsthand experience.”
Ritchie said the team is using this experience to get the new players up to speed and help them adjust to potential new roles. He said this will happen over the course of the season and come in part through gameplay.
“Those guys that carry themselves in that way – they accelerate the learning of these guys,” Ritchie said. “And when you can put them in the right platform and do enough work, it brings them along.”
Ritchie said the team culture he has created endures from year to year, and every season is an opportunity to build upon it.
“That’s what we all live this for,” Ritchie said. “It’s not just baseball. it’s the whole life. It’s the essence of everything.”
Senior infielder Noah Levin said Ritchie has prepared the seniors for leadership roles, and the team feels ready to bring new players on board. He said he also played during the off-season in a summer collegiate league.
“I played in a league with some younger guys,” Levin said. “So that helped me develop a leadership role, where I was able to talk with some of the younger guys and really learn how to communicate with them.”
Levin said the team is also working to be more consistent on defense to compliment their strong play on offense. Last year, the Colonials ranked in the top 50 in the nation in on-base percentage and batting average.
Fergus said the team is looking to capture an A-10 Championship and they have the right team to do it. He said between the coaching staff, the new additions and the returning players, there is a lot of confidence that they can “really make a run.”
“We’re all confident, no one’s scared to fail, and each day in practice is a competition,” Fergus said. “So everyone’s just competing, and it really shows, like in the inner-squads we have, everybody just looks like they got a new gear.”
It is not just the roster that has seen new additions. Ritchie brought on three new coaches for the upcoming season: Tyler Kavanaugh as assistant coach and recruiting coordinator, Chris O’Neill as assistant coach and Ryan Gaynor as volunteer assistant coach.
Ritchie said he hopes the experience between the coaches will be an asset for the team.
Following a canceled season in 2020 and a season of reduced travel and fans in 2021, the team is excited to return to full play, starting their year in Texas before heading to South Carolina.
“I haven’t gotten a chance to make a run at the A-10 Championship,” Levin said. “So that really is what I’m focused on is now doing whatever we need to do just to get prepared to win.”
Both Fergus and Levin talked about sharing their experiences throughout their time in the program, making sure to include all the new players. Fergus said the seniors want the team to be together from the start.
“We truly believe in ourselves, believe in the coaching staff and everything we’ve been through as a team just bonds everybody closer together,” Fergus said. “And it’s just that I think team chemistry is what’s really going to show up this year.”

Watching drag queens perform while enjoying brunch should be on everyone’s D.C. bucket list, so we’ve compiled a list of some of our favorites.
Drag shows have been going on since the late 1800s, but since the success of shows like RuPaul’s Drag Race and its many spinoffs, drag as a form of entertainment has become more popular than ever.

1811 Columbia Rd. NW. Sundays, 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 3 p.m. Tickets are $39.95.
Class Act Drag Brunch
Since reopening as a sushi and southern food restaurant in 2020, Sign of The Whale continues to host Class Act Drag Brunch every Saturday.

The performers dance and interact with guests around the first floor where you’re seated and perform from a lofted second floor area visible from downstairs.

D.C. Drag Brunch – Twice is Nice
Hosted at Harlot, an eccentrically decorated lounge and event space north of Shaw, D.C. Drag Brunch sells out fast. The show is hosted by drag queen Monet Dupree who’s been performing for 20 years.

The $50 tickets include an all-you-can-eat brunch buffet. You pay $20 ahead of time to reserve your spot and the remaining $30 when you arrive.

Professor Adnan Hyder joins 11 other professors and corporate leaders in the advisory group. 
A Milken Institute School of Public Health professor will propose recommendations on noncommunicable disease research in a World Health Organization advisory group over the next two years.
Adnan Hyder, a professor of global health, joined the WHO’s Technical Advisory Group of Experts on NCD Research and Innovation in December to propose prevention strategies for noncommunicable diseases, which are chronic conditions that do not infect others like diabetes and asthma. Hyder said the advisory group will meet twice a year to discuss ways to reduce risk factors, like obesity and smoking, and how to direct more research investments in low- and middle-income countries.
The WHO established the advisory group composed of 12 professors and corporate leaders with expertise in noncommunicable diseases from a dozen countries including the United States, Oman and Peru last July.
The advisory group discussed how to support low- and middle-income countries with gross national incomes less than $1,005 per capita to conduct noncommunicable disease research activities during their first meeting via Zoom earlier this month.
“I think it’s incredibly important for us to ensure that institutions around the world begin to recognize the impact that these NCDs are having on people in their countries,” Hyder said.
Hyder said he hopes to expand the number of institutions in low- and middle-income countries to create preventative treatment strategies that can reduce the disproportionate impact of noncommunicable diseases in those areas of the world.
Four out of five people who live with a noncommunicable disease live in a low- and middle-income country, according to NCD Alliance – an organization that creates and tracks noncommunicable disease global policies.
He said the advisory group will prioritize research dedicated to noncommunicable diseases, like HIV and tuberculosis, that require more treatment plans in low and middle-income countries, where risk factors, like alcohol intake and obesity, are more prevalent.
Hyder said increasing global noncommunicable disease research can potentially end one third of all premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases by 2030.
“Over the years, the WHO has been analyzing what work has been done in countries, and by governments and by other stakeholders, one of the areas in which they find needs more work is research and innovation,” Hyder said.
Hyder said urging international governments to devote more funding to noncommunicable disease research is challenging because governments are prioritizing money and political policies for other crucial issues, like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
He said the advisory group will cite economic analyses that highlight the personal health impacts of noncommunicable diseases to encourage governments to increase their research funding.
Noncommunicable diseases, like heart attacks and cancer, produce higher death rates that cause lower productivity rates in low-income countries and harm their economic growth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“I’m very proud of the fact that some of us from GW are participating in such committees,” Hyder said. “I think it’s incredibly important for us to be part of the global community, but also to understand global dynamics and participate in it.”
Tiina Laatikainen, a member of the advisory group and the director of the Public Health and Welfare Department in the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, said the advisory team aims to strengthen prevention management rehabilitation of patients with noncommunicable diseases in low-income countries.
She said she will work with Hyder and the other members of the advisory group to propose recommendations for low- and middle-income countries to increase funding opportunities and support networks in the noncommunicable disease sector.
Laatikainen said the advisory group should consider regional circumstances when trying to provide funding opportunities for research in governments for noncommunicable disease research.
“This is a global issue and through this, I think the main aim is really to get the representatives from different parts of the countries to get the knowledge, to get the experience and gather together anyway,” Laatikainen said.
Salim Virani, a member of the advisory group and a professor of medicine at Baylor University, said the advisory group will discuss methods for how patients with noncommunicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries can receive the same level of treatments and therapies as those in higher-income countries to guide the WHO’s recommendations.
He said implementing therapies and other treatments for noncommunicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries is a challenge because the advisory group needs to make sure they provide recommendations for basic primary treatments before they identify newer therapies.
“We know that some of the basic therapies that patients should receive, they’re not receiving so that’s where I think the key is,” he said.
Virani said COVID-19 infection places patients at higher risk of noncommunicable disease contraction, and the pandemic expanded the need to address noncommunicable diseases on a global scale. He said the pandemic limited treatment measures and increased risk factors like smoking, which worsened the conditions of patients with noncommunicable diseases.
Pandemic lockdowns reduced noncommunicable disease screening programs and staffing in outpatient disease-specific clinics, hindering access to health facilities for patients with noncommunicable diseases, according to a WHO report.
“Because of this bi-directional association, it becomes even more important to actually double down on NCDs because the next few waves of COVID-19 are probably going to be related to resurgence,” he said.

Wrighton had previously attended the Board’s executive committee meeting, but Friday marked his first appearance at a public Board meeting. 
Interim University President Mark Wrighton delivered remarks at his first Board of Trustees open meeting Friday, recapping his first impressions of the GW community and meetings with students, faculty and staff.
The Board meeting came as trustees, faculty and administrators have been working to improve shared governance at GW in advance of the search for a permanent University president. Wrighton said he has spent his first few weeks in office attending events like town hall meetings to improve shared governance at the University and joining Black Heritage Celebration events.
“I’m looking forward to continuing a great tradition of community engagement that will serve us well as we look ahead,” Wrighton said at the meeting.
Wrighton said in an interview that officials appear to be on track with plans to finalize a set of recommendations to improve shared governance at the University, which the Board will consider in May.
“Chair Speights gave a preamble prior to announcing me and indicated two things – that shared governance would be dealt with and near the end of the semester, a search for a more permanent president would be undertaken,” Wrighton said in the interview. “And as far as I know, we are still on that path. It takes some time to execute a process to identify a new president.”
Wrighton said trustees are “aware” of recent incidents in which a professor in the School of Business incorrectly told a student she couldn’t have her service dog in her classroom and a white GWTeach professor said the N-word in a class on anti-racism. Wrighton declined to comment on what action officials would take against the professors despite students’ calls for their removal from the University
“We discussed these incidents with the Board yesterday, and they are aware, and they are aware of the seriousness of the incidents and concerns about the wellbeing of our students,” Wrighton said. “We do not comment on personnel actions. Those are completely private.”
Trustee Ellen Zane, the chair of the Board’s committee on finance and investments, said at the meeting that the University’s projections for the second quarter of the fiscal year are in line with GW’s annual goal of revenues exceeding expenses by 2 percent on a normalized basis. GW broke even on last year’s budget, meeting officials’ goal after they implemented budget cuts to mitigate a $180 million gap.
Zane said the University’s endowment reached a “record high” of $2.44 billion by the end of 2021.
“The capital budget is also tracking according to plan including the Thurston Hall renovation, which is on budget and on time for a fall 2022 opening,” Zane said.
Trustee Avram Tucker, the vice chair of the Board’s committee on finance and investments, said recent undergraduate enrollment trends are overall “doing quite well” despite a decrease in international enrollment, in light of the regular decision application deadline for undergraduates on Jan. 5.
Officials said in October that international student enrollment fell by 7.5 percent, which they said was the result of pandemic-related travel restrictions.
“We’re expecting to have good applications and enrollment in fall of 2022,” Tucker said. “International applications are returning back to normal except for China.”

Looking for relationship advice this Valentine’s Day? Hear what these GW couples have to say. 
Sophomore Alex Horowitz had already been on a first date with her now-girlfriend Avery Shields when GW’s Marriage Pact became the second matchmaking algorithm to pair them together.
“We actually had matched on Bumble before Marriage Pact, and we had messaged a few times, and we had a first date planned,” she said. “Then we got Marriage Pact-ed in the midst of that.”
She said the timing could not have been more perfect given their recent introduction on the dating app.
“The day before Marriage Pact came out, we went on a date and then we got initials the next day, and they were the same,” she said.
Horowitz said quality time is a key component in a healthy relationship, and she and Shields have found ways to accommodate their busy schedules and heavy work loads by spending time together whilst getting classwork done.
“We’ve started studying together and doing homework together,” she said. “It’s pretty hard because both of us want to succeed in school as well as make time for each other.”
Horowitz’s said college is a “great time to be in a relationship,” because there are “so many places you can go and things to do,” with your partner. 
Juniors Kate Carpenter and Henry Long met in a freshman year meditation class but didn’t start dating until March 2021.
“Sophomore year, he had reached out to me because I’ve been in the Student Association for a while, and Henry had gone up in ranks at WRGW, the on-campus radio show, and he was doing podcasts for them,” Carpenter said. “I’m the Student Association girl, so they’re doing a Student Association podcast for WRGW. He reaches out to me to be on it. And I’m like, ‘Oh, of course. That’s the guy from meditation class.’”
Carpenter and Long said that podcast received more than 70 listens, a high performance for the show. But it wasn’t until seven months later, while classes were remote, that the relationship began to spark.
“We texted for about a month and a half, during the pandemic, did some FaceTime calls, because he was in North Carolina and I was in D.C.,” she said. “And then we went on our first date the day before his birthday. It was a super romantic first date, and then we started dating like five days later.”
Long said despite advice he’s heard telling couples to “never stop dating” to keep the romance alive, more realistic advice for college couples on a budget should be exactly the opposite.
“We always laugh about this because people always say ‘Never stop dating,’ and we had a joke about it this year because we are trying to save money in 2022,” Long said. “So we were like ‘Our new resolution is to stop dating and save some money.’”
Instead of fancy and costly evenings out, the pair work hard to devote a little bit of time each week just for each other, even committing to lunches every week at the same time.
“Even if the day is super crazy, in which a meeting comes up or there’s a crisis, like if it’s Tuesday, Thursday, we know we’ll be having lunch together,” Long said. “And so it’s like just a quaint hour where we can sit around and like nothing about anything else. We walk together and explore the city together. We’re lucky to live in D.C.”
Senior Emma Brady and her boyfriend Alexander Satin’s paths crossed freshman year, but they didn’t start dating until 2021. Brady and Satin lived on the Vern their freshman year but never formally met.
“He was my Vern crush,” she said. “I didn’t even know his name. I would just see him around the Vern and think ‘That kid is so cute.’ I literally thought his name was Nick.”
The two parted ways at the end of the year without ever actually meeting each other but were given a second shot when both moved back to D.C. in December 2020. As it turned out, their new apartment buildings were two buildings apart.
“I found out that apparently he thought I was cute too on the Vern,” she said. “And he didn’t know who I was. And he totally forgot about me too. So it’s just like a weird, full circle moment.”
Brady and Satin officially began dating almost two years after both living on the Vern.
“It was a very cute thing for me because I was like ‘Oh my god, I feel like I’m back in high school again. Someone likes me back,’” she said.
Brady said the couple’s favorite place to go in the city together is to the National Cathedral for picnics.
“He got me a really beautiful, cool picnic basket for our six month anniversary, so we love to use it like all the time,” Brady said. 
While the city offers endless entertainment, the most important part of a good date is the person you’re on it with.
“We’re literally never bored or anything but I guess because we’re dating that’s the reason we’re not bored,” she said. “So it’s like really like finding the right person and like doing whatever you can to like deal with them whenever you can.”
