A broader lawsuit for damages and a request for documents regarding the cancellation of the team's varsity status are still pending.
A federal judge denied an emergency motion from the men’s rowing team’s captain Thursday afternoon that would have required the University to reinstate the varsity status of the team.
D.C. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell denied Patrick George’s emergency motion for a temporary restraining order, which would have prohibited GW from cancelling the varsity status of the rowing team, but a broader suit against the University and a request for documents regarding the termination of the team’s varsity status are still pending. The denial is a blow to George’s attempt to retain the team’s varsity standing for the current season, which started with a regatta against Georgetown University Saturday.
George – a fourth-year student and member of the men’s rowing team since 2018 – sued the University in D.C. Superior Court Friday, alleging the University defrauded him, breached its contract and engaged in deceptive trade practices in failing to renew his athletic scholarship for the upcoming academic year. University attorneys moved the case to federal court Monday.
Attorneys for the University filed their opposition to George’s motion before Thursday’s hearing, calling the request an “attempted abuse” of the restraining order process. The memo argues none of George’s charges against the University are “viable” and that there were no grounds for an injunction from the court.
“George has not pled sufficient facts to support any viable legal claim against GW,” the memo states. “Much less that he is likely to succeed on the merits of any of those claims.”
The memo states George failed to prove that GW officials promised to maintain men’s rowing as a varsity sport throughout his athletic eligibility, which fails to meet legal standards for fraud or breach of contract.
“He has pointed to no specific, actionable statement made by anyone connected with his recruiting process that was false at the time it was made,” the memo states. “Instead, he alleges only that some unidentified person at ‘GW falsely represented . . . that the Men’s Rowing Team would remain a varsity sport at GW throughout his collegiate athletic eligibility years.’”
The memo states George’s timing in bringing the lawsuit against the University, nearly two years after the cuts of seven varsity sports were announced, shows that there is no “emergency” for which a temporary restraining order is needed.
“To the extent that George wanted to continue to compete at the varsity level beyond the 2020-2021 season, he could have transferred to another university; he did not,” the memo states. “Instead, George alleges that he made a written formal request that the team’s varsity status be reinstated in August 2021 and did not receive a response. And yet, he waited an additional eight months – until April 2022 – to file this Motion.”

Jackson taught a federal sentencing seminar at GW Law during the 2011, 2012 and 2014 spring semesters.
Former GW Law adjunct professor Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve on the Supreme Court on Thursday.
Three Republicans joined all 50 Senate Democrats in a 53-47 vote to approve Jackson’s nomination to the bench, making her the first Black female Supreme Court justice in American history. Jackson taught a federal sentencing seminar at GW Law during the 2011, 2012 and 2014 spring semesters, according to written responses she submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Jackson, a 51-year-old District native, joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last year after serving on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for eight years.
President Joe Biden nominated Jackson to fill the seat of Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced his retirement from the high court in January, 27 years after he was sworn in as a justice.
“This is a great moment for Judge Jackson, but it is an even greater moment for America as we rise to a more perfect union,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said on the Senate floor Thursday immediately preceding the final vote.
Upon joining the court, Jackson will become the third sitting justice to have taught at GW Law. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas co-taught a constitutional law seminar with law professor Gregory Maggs in the fall semester of 2011, while Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett taught the same seminar in spring 2001.
Jackson said the University paid her $1,765 in 2014 for her teaching duties, according to the questionnaire.
GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew voiced support for Jackson last month, signing a letter to the senate’s party and Judiciary Committee leaders alongside all of the country’s 40 Black law school deans.
“As leaders in the American legal academy, we believe this confirmation would represent a triumph for this nation,” Matthew and the other deans wrote in the letter.
Jackson faced a contentious confirmation battle that ended in a near-party-line vote. With all 50 Senate Democrats backing Jackson, her confirmation was all but assured, but Jackson’s support was further boosted by three moderate Republicans – Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska – who also supported several procedural votes throughout the week to advance the nomination.
“They’re stacking the deck with far-left prosecutors, woke warriors at the Department of Justice and federal judges who believe criminals deserve lighter treatment,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday. “This project is terrible for innocent American families, and every piece of evidence suggests Democrats view Judge Jackson as its crown jewel.”
Jackson recused herself from a GW case in 2014 while she was professor at the law school, citing a potential conflict of interest. A student had alleged the University improperly expelled him when he was accused of cheating on an exam.
Jackson’s ties to another institution – Harvard University – were raised during the confirmation process. Jackson, who graduated from Harvard and serves on the school’s Board of Overseers, said during her confirmation hearing that she would recuse herself from an upcoming case challenging Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policy.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
My goal was two videos a week. Each Sunday, we would meet with the editor in chief to discuss our pitches and immediately race to source people, film the event and edit the footage by the following week. That was the routine and it worked. From Sunday afternoon to Saturday evening, I was constantly moving 100 miles per hour to make sure that I met every deadline and strived to make each video better than the last. I filmed basketball games in the Smith Center, edited videos for student organization events on campus and spoke with community leaders around Foggy Bottom. Every video was another item on my to-do list to check off.
The COVID pandemic completely threw the routine out the window. Working from home in the initial months of the pandemic was already difficult. You were forced to restructure your daily schedule and take into account all of the technical difficulties you could encounter that would inhibit you from producing your best work. But our section relied exclusively on footage we filmed ourselves at in-person events held on campus and in the District. I had to get creative, but that meant I had to change the routine.
In December 2020, I pitched an idea to Sarah to create a D.C. neighborhood video series. I aimed to speak with community activists, long-time residents and elected officials from a certain neighborhood to create an oral history of the changes that occurred throughout the years. I started with Chinatown. At first, I anticipated the entire process to be simple and completed in two weeks. I envisioned a five-minute video that would touch upon different aspects of the neighborhood as a means to stick to the publication schedule of our team.

The project ended up lasting for two months. Before the pandemic, this would have horrified me. To work solely on a single video for two months was far under the minimum I had set for myself. But in working on the project, I learned a lot more than I had thought I would have. I went on to create videos on U Street, Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan. I discussed the founding of the first LGBTQ+ bookstore in D.C. with co-owners Deacon Maccubbin and Jim Bennett, learned about the resilience of Ben’s Chili Bowl through the tides of gentrification, heard about the experience of immigrating from Fujian province in China to the District and researched the resurgence of artistic retail space in Adams Morgan. Having the privilege to sit down and speak with my neighbors openly about their experiences living in D.C. was eye-opening. It felt like I was giving back to the community that had given so much to me through college.
Journalism isn’t about to-do lists and publication schedules. Yes, deadlines are important. But The Hatchet taught me that what is truly meaningful in video journalism is having the opportunity to sit down and candidly speak with people to capture their stories in the way they hope to portray it.
Of course, I can’t take all of the credit. Without The Hatchet, I wouldn’t have even considered enhancing my video skills and I wouldn’t have met the great team of people along the way:
Heidi: I am so grateful that you joined The Hatchet freshman year. I remember you walked into our video training session spring semester and you were the only new videographer we welcomed to the team. Still, that didn’t discourage you. We then had two technical difficulties filming your first video rendering our footage unsalvageable and you still stayed with us. Through the multiple ups and downs we had, and we certainly had a few, I knew I could depend on you when I was in a pinch. Working alongside you on The Hatchet certainly was one of the many reasons I stayed with it.
Sarah: I don’t even know if you will read this because you have long graduated and are off doing amazing things at your full-time job. I remember at one of our social events you said to me, “I wanted to comment on your Instagram post but I didn’t know if we were close enough to do that.” That definitely got a chuckle out of me. Unfortunately, the pandemic rolled around and we were sent home before we could get closer but I sincerely thank you for being a great boss for the bulk of my time with The Hatchet. You always pushed me to think outside of the box and expected the most from me. You also never shot down one of my ideas and I was able to explore my more creative side. Under your leadership, I bolstered my video skills and became more confident as an editor and a person. Thank you for everything.
Amanda: I understand the struggle of leading the video team. Among the smallest sections on The Hatchet with some of the most demanding work, it can get tiresome. However, when I had to unexpectedly step down from The Hatchet to focus on personal manners, you kept the team afloat. Your diligence and tenacity is admirable. You also always showed up with a positive spirit that emulated through your work. I am beyond confident that you will lead the video team to new heights next year and expand the group. If you ever need anything, know that I am always available to help out.
Thais: I still remember first meeting you when we traveled to Chinatown to film the barbershop. Even though your footage ended up a little shaky and my audio was shoddy, it was fun to get back out and film in person again. Attending classes in your first semester is tough but joining the video section of the student newspaper, which normally requires you to be in person everywhere, while you were in Illinois is commendable. Your patience to stick it out virtually and still create high-quality videos that evinced your skill is praiseworthy. It has definitely been a rocky two years but I know for sure that you will find your footing within your major and achieve amazing things.
Arianna: When I joined The Hatchet, I was a timid freshman with an interest in video and no knowledge of journalism. Your welcoming composure along with your hard work running both the video and podcast sections inspired me to take on a staff position with The Hatchet. Thank you for believing in me.
My non-Hatchet friends: Thank you all for bearing with me as I spent each and every waking moment at GW with some Hatchet-related complaint. Thank you for dealing with my frustrations of spending Sunday nights busy and random weekdays running around to capture footage for a story idea you ignored when I went into great detail explaining. You are all great.
My Mom: Mama, I am beyond thankful for your support with The Hatchet. When I had to come home during the initial months of the pandemic, I was happily surprised to find you watching all of the videos I had a byline for. Your support through it all kept me going and I can graduate knowing you gave me the emotional strength to reach the finish line.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
As a photojournalism major, the Hatchet seemed like the obvious choice in a student org to invest my time and learn more about the world of journalism. I joined as a sophomore, shyly coming to photo meetings in the townhouse basement. I quickly became comfortable with the editors and other photographs, and quickly felt more empowered as a photographer working with the Hatchet. Every week taking photo assignments, I felt more in the loop with campus happenings, more connected to the student body and more appreciative of the vibrant GWU and greater D.C. community.
Working with culture and features, I really got to break out from the Foggy Bottom bubble. As a staff photographer, I loved taking weekend outlook assignments, then bringing my friends and making a day of it. As culture photo editor my junior year, I was thrilled to be in the budgeting meetings and learn about all the hottest places in D.C. that I hadn’t hit yet. As features editor this year, I love finding hidden gems in the city and sending other photographers to cover them for snapshots so they get to have that same experience I did.
Departing the Hatchet, I am very proud of the work the photo team did these last two years. We adapted to covering D.C. events from living rooms all over the country during the pandemic, we faced so many awkward Zoom hotseats, and we were able to come back to campus and readjust to in-person days and nights in the townhouse. We all pushed ourselves to come up with creative solutions for stories, and came back to D.C. stronger photographers and editors than ever.
I feel so lucky to have been under the leadership of such inspirational women editors the whole time I was on staff, and to be part of such a girl boss photo team for two years in a row. My peers both on the Hatchet and in my photojournalism cohort have given me so much hope for the currently male-dominated journalism industry. I’m looking forward to watching us move into the world to bring more diverse voices and perspectives on global issues.
 
Sydney: I am so glad we both chose the tiniest, most niche little major when we were eighteen!! It’s been so much fun growing as visual storytellers together in Smith Hall, Corcoran, Eddie Adams and the townhouse.
Grace: This year with you at the helm was amazing. Thanks so much for keeping us all in line, calm and on time. It’s been so much fun seeing your photos get stronger and stronger over the past three years and watching you come into this position of leadership so naturally and with such ~grace.~
Auden: I’m so glad you got to hop on the photo team mid-year! You’ve become such a great editor in such a small amount of time, and I know you’ll be such a great senior photo editor next year!!
Danielle: You did such a great job this year on news! You had such a heavy workload and you did the damn thing!! I know you’re going to do such big things with features next year, and I can’t wait to see it!
I am so thankful for all the opportunities the Hatchet gave me to photograph, learn and grow. A few of my favorites (of course including Josh Peck <3) are below.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
If anyone told me sophomore year when I joined the Hatchet that I would eventually be the sports beat photo editor, I wouldn’t have believed them. My very first photo assignment was a GW men’s soccer game on the Vern. However, I quickly found that my favorite part about being a Hatchet photographer wasn’t attending sporting events, but getting out of the Foggy Bottom bubble to visit new restaurants, see unique murals and attend local D.C. events.
When the pandemic began in March of 2020, all of those fun outings stopped. After making countless photo illustrations of computer screens I began to reminisce about some amazing photo opportunities that were #OnlyAtGW moments. I missed photographing the random protests outside of Kogan Plaza, incredible guest speakers like José Andrés and Dolores Huerta and surprisingly, sporting events.
With that said, when the sports beat photo editor position opened last semester, I took a chance and genuinely found an appreciation for sports photography. The energy of the crowd and athletes at games kept me on my toes and excited me. It was a sharp learning curve, but I improved my visual literacy, gained knowledge in photo editing and had many slices of pizza in the basketball media room. Some moments on the sports beat I’ll never forget are the dogs who jump rope during half-time shows, getting seasick while photographing sailing practice in the Potomac and of course, the time my camera and I almost got knocked out by a basketball.
Despite graduating in the middle of these strange times, I feel more prepared for what lies ahead in my career as a photographer because of my time at The Hatchet where I had the privilege of visually documenting moments like these:
Sydney Walsh | Assistant Photo Editor
Camille: I’ll never forget the night at the Red Eye market when the only thing we got out of it was a Snapshot. Thank you for always being someone I can rely on for your honest opinion, calico appreciation and for being a great friend. It’s been amazing to see you and your photography evolve, I’m so excited to see where life takes you.
Grace: Your dedication and drive is incredible and something I’ll always admire about you. Despite your busy schedule, you still find a way to meet deadlines and stay on top of everything. I have no doubt that you will succeed at whatever you do. I hope you get the most out of life and take time to enjoy it!
Danielle: I can’t wait to see your creativity flow as the features photo editor next year! I’m so excited to see the work you make as a photojournalism major and where you take the GW Chapter of NPPA. Your drive, dedication and bright ideas will be sure to move the photo industry forward.
Auden: I’m so glad you joined the photo team this semester! It’s been great to have your energy present. Thank you for photographing all those basketball games last semester. It’s been wonderful to see you grow. I’m sure you will lead the photo team next year with grace and success!
Jordyn, Rachel and Krishna: It was so great to see all of you at photographer meetings and seeing your work! Good luck next year. I know the photo team is in good hands!
Past Editors: Arielle: When I first met you, who knew we’d spend more time in Florida together than in D.C.! Thank you for all of your life advice and Hatchet guidance throughout the years, introducing me to Taylor Swift podcasts and convincing me to be the sports beat photo editor. I can’t wait for our next road trip!
Family and Friends: Thank you for always supporting my goals and your words of wisdom from life outside the journalism world!

All of GW’s graduate schools were ranked in the top 100 in the country, according to US News and World Report’s latest rankings released last week.
About two dozen of GW’s graduate programs were also ranked in the top 25 in the country, according to the report. Some of the University’s top programs featured the international business program at 11th, the international law program at 10th, the master’s of nursing administration at third and international global policy and administration at sixth.
GW Law was ranked 25th, the School of Nursing’s master’s program and doctorate program ranked 27th and 30th, respectively, while the School of Business was ranked 55th.
US News and World Report uses surveys sent to experts in related fields to determine a program’s reputation and statistics that evaluate research, faculty and students’ success to determine graduate school rankings.
GW is ranked 11th in public health programs, a tie with the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and the Milken Institute School of Public Health’s health care management program ranked 12th nationally.
The law school tied nationally for 25th with the University of Notre Dame and the University of Alabama. GW’s part-time law program rose from 3rd to 2nd, getting beat out by Georgetown Law for the top spot.
GW’s public affairs programs overall ranked 12th on the list, with four specialty programs making the top 10 in their respective rankings: homeland security and emergency management at seventh, health policy and management at ninth, international global policy and administration at sixth and public management and leadership at eighth.
The business school’s project management MBA program ranked ninth, tied with Georgetown.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
A previous version of this story said GW Law was GW’s top ranked graduate program. Multiple graduate programs were ranked higher. We regret this error.

The Office of the Legislator General filed a lawsuit against the SA finance committee chair in February for legislation that gave the finance committee the power to sanction student organizations. 
The Student Court will convene Sunday to hear a case on the Student Association’s updated finance laws that allowed the finance committee to sanction student organizations.
In a general order issued Monday, Chief Justice Yun-Da Tsai said the hearing will take place Sunday at 7 p.m. in the Law Learning Center to rule on the Office of the Legislator General’s February complaint alleging that the bylaws grant the finance committee “unilateral authority” to enact sanctions. Tsai said in the order that the defendant – SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U, and the head of the SA finance committee – and the Office of the Legislator General need to submit briefs to him by Friday.
The legislators general filed the complaint against legislation called the Financial Reorganization Act, which the SA Senate passed in February, updating the bylaws and allowing the finance committee to sanction student organizations.
The court delayed its initial consideration of the complaint in late February after Xu filed a motion to stay the lawsuit. A day later, the senate passed a new bill to address the issues laid out in the complaint.
The legislator general’s office submitted an amended complaint last month alleging that the bill does not outline how the finance committee would administer sanctions to student organizations, and the sanctioning sections of the legislation are still unconstitutional. Xu submitted an answer to the amended complaint urging the court to dismiss the case, arguing the lawsuit is now irrelevant.
The latest order outlined four questions for the defendants and plaintiffs to address in their briefs like which SA branch has sanctioning power, what authority is needed to issue sanctions, how the court should help handle sanction appeals and what parts of the sanction legislation will remain valid if the court invalidates a section of it.
In his answer, Xu contested that the finance committee will only theoretically be able to sanction student organizations until the power expires in July because of the updated legislation the senate passed, rendering the case irrelevant. He said the committee wouldn’t sanction any student organizations before July because SA bylaws do not outline or provide for the sanctioning process despite the powers his legislation grants.
Tsai, the chief justice of the court, said individuals and student organizations can submit amicus briefs on the questions outlined in the order to him by Friday.
The hearing will live stream on the SA’s Facebook page.

The data comes after student advocates for sexual assault survivors have called on the University to increase transparency and clarify the barring policy for students. 
Updated: April 7, 2022 at 3:48 p.m.
The number of people barred from campus has declined by more than half since 2017, data released by the GW Police Department shows.
The data reveals that GWPD officers issued 89 bar notices – which ban individuals from campus buildings for five years, subject to appeal before officials – in 2021. The report, which shows a 58 percent drop in barring notices since 2017, comes after student advocates for sexual assault survivors have called on the University to increase transparency and clarify the barring policy for students.
GWPD Chief James Tate said although officers can bar individuals from University buildings, these notices don’t apply to streets or public spaces on or near campus. Student leaders said in October that sexual assault survivors don’t feel safe on campus under the threat of their abusers returning to campus without punishment as a result of the University’s “unacceptable” handling of Title IX violations.
“We can only bar individuals from our property,” he said in an interview. “And so if we bar someone from District House, and they’re on the sidewalk in front of District House, they’re not violating the bar.”
Tate said most bar notices are distributed to people who trespass onto University property, though GWPD officers have also barred some subjects from campus for suspected harassment, theft and other crimes.
He said GWPD doesn’t have exclusive authority to ban students from campus. Title IX and Student Rights and Responsibilities can also limit a student’s access to from campus in accordance with their respective processes.
“Let’s say we arrest a student for assaulting another student, and they actually went to the detention facility, they got booked, all of those things happened, right?” Tate said. “We would not bar that student because that student needs to go through a University proceeding.”
GWPD barred about 13 people per month during the fall semester last year – after campus reopened to the entire student body – compared to about 18 per month throughout 2017, the highest rate of bar notices during the past five years. The number of bar notices dipped to 141 in 2018 and 138 in 2019, before plummeting to 57 in 2020 during the pandemic, the data shows.
Total crime on the Foggy Bottom Campus dropped by about 75 percent in 2020 during the pandemic, according to a GWPD report released last fall.
Tate said 41 people have appealed their barring notices since 2017, and 12 of those appeals were successful. He said other officials, like SRR officials, help determine if officials should grant appeals to students.
“Appeals may be granted where the basis for the barring notice no longer exists – for example, students whose permission to return to the University community was restored or their suspension period has ended,” he said.
Tate said GWPD gives about 10 percent of bar notices to students who are suspended or expelled, a lower number partly because there is a higher standard of investigation for students because of proceedings required to ban a student from campus. He said while officials can instantly ban non-GW affiliated subjects from campus, students undergo University proceedings within departments outside GWPD, like the Title IX Office and the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, before barring notices can be issued.
Tate said he hopes to release a map showing where barred people are legally allowed on campus to increase the public’s understanding of bar notices. He said he met with members of Students Against Sexual Assault last semester and determined the University’s barring procedures needed to be clarified because of confusion about what a barring notice entails.
“We’re working to bring some clarity to all of that and to share that in a pretty public way with our community so students, staff and faculty understand how the process works,” Tate said.
Members of gwprotectsrapists, a student advocacy group for sexual assault survivors, claimed GWPD has failed to communicate and meet with Students Against Sexual Assault about potential changes to the barring notices policy, according to a post the group released Wednesday.
“From pushing back meetings and dates for when we will be able to see any progress for months, it is clear to see that the University is just waiting for us to graduate and our movement to phase out,” the post states.
gwprotectsrapists deferred comment to SASA, whose members did not return multiple requests for comment.
Tate said GWPD’s response to bar violations depends on the circumstances of the violation, but if officers find someone has entered a building where they were previously barred, the subject will likely be arrested for trespassing.
He added that GWPD officers restrict barring notices to those who can cause disturbances or danger to the campus community. He said officers do not distribute bar notices to people sleeping in public areas on campus, despite University policy that grants GWPD the authority to do so.
“Our officers are trained to use some discretion in those sorts of situations,” Tate said. “If someone is not being disruptive, they’re simply out at two, three o’clock in the morning trying to rest where they can, I personally see no need to issue a bar.”

Members of the Faculty Senate will vote on a resolution to strengthen shared governance among the Board of Trustees, administrators and faculty during Friday’s senate meeting.
Senators will vote on a resolution proposing a list of shared governance principles and mechanisms, including one to establish annual evaluations of the University president and biannual meetings among the senate’s executive committee, trustees and GW’s president. The resolution comes after the shared governance task force conducted a survey in February that highlighted faculty, administrators and trustees’ desire for increased communication and collaboration with each other.
The shared governance task force went on a retreat in February to discuss the survey results and prepare shared governance recommendations for the Board to approve this spring.
Provost Chris Bracey will also present a report on annual core indicators of academic excellence, which will typically includes University-wide updates like GW applications, faculty hiring and faculty pay.
The senate will vote on a resolution to approve changes to the Code of Academic Integrity, including revisions to the listed definitions of academic integrity violations. The senate updated the code last March to take a more “restorative and educational” approach to low-level academic integrity violations.
Faculty senators will also vote on a resolution to expand the availability of internal research awards for multi-year internal research projects and another to call on officials to affirm their support for educators facing state legislation censoring curriculum on race and LGBTQ+ issues.
The senate will vote to approve nominees for the incoming executive committee, which includes one faculty senator from each of GW’s academic schools, the senate’s parliamentarian and the chair of the dispute resolutions committee. The senate will also vote to reelect Sarah Binder, the current parliamentarian, and Joan Schaffner, the current dispute resolutions committee chair and an associate professor of law, to their respective positions.
Faculty senators will vote on two resolutions of appreciation for Arthur Wilson, the outgoing chair of the senate’s executive committee, and Miriam Galston, the outgoing vice chair, whose terms on the committee will conclude this year.

The bill transfers all the remaining funds in the SBA’s account to the Student Assistance Fund, which will give money to students who need assistance with funding needs like emergency food and transportation.
The Student Bar Association Senate donated more than $18,000 to a need-based student fund in a bill unanimously passed Tuesday.
The bill transfers all the funds remaining in the SBA’s account for the current school year to the Student Assistance Fund, which will give money to students who need financial assistance for needs like emergency food and transportation. The senate also passed five joint resolutions to show appreciation for law school staff and nine resolutions confirming next year’s executive cabinet members.
SBA Sen. Cyrus Dutton, a third-year law student who co-sponsored the ad hoc authorization to fill the Student Assistance Fund, said he was careful to limit the SBA’s allocations to student organizations’ requests throughout the school year to ensure the senate could provide for student assistance. He said the senate’s finance committee had to sometimes deny requests, like the Law Revue’s request for additional funding for new lighting, so the SBA could maintain the funding to transfer more than $18,000.
“It’s incredible,” he said at the meeting. “I’m very proud of my committee and all the work they’ve done this year.”
The Student Association finance committee allocated $180,915 to the SBA throughout the academic year. The SBA allocates the funds to student organizations for events and ad hoc funding throughout the year.
SBA President Jordan Michel vetoed the Student Org Bylaw Reorganization Act for the third time, but the senate voted to override the veto without amending the act, adding the bill to the SBA bylaws. The bill will stop requiring new student organizations in the law school to appear before the senate as part of their creation process.
Michel said the finance or student organization and charter committees – which regularly interact with student organizations – should determine whether a student organization should appear before the senate in case of any necessary clarifications. He also said the legislation should include an appeals process for student organizations with alleged violations of processes like registration leading up to their creation.
The senate unanimously passed the Finance Modernization Act, which amends the SBA’s bylaws to clarify when the finance committee’s term starts and ends and streamline the process of submitting financial requests.
Senators unanimously approved the constitution for the Armenian Law Students Association. Harut Minasian, a third-year law student who delivered comments on behalf of the organization, pushed senators to vote for the approval because many Armenian students have historically attended the law school.
“We are descendants of genocide survivors, and especially in this city, in Washington D.C., the capital of the land of opportunity, I think it sends a particular message,” he said.
Michel said the law students graduating this spring will be the first in recent memory to not donate to the SBA’s endowed scholarship fund for incoming law students. He said he understood that students wanted to send a message to the University regarding concerns about its scholarship spending, but he questioned whether canceling the gift was the best way to protest.
“The school is going to do their fundraising regardless of whether or not we say we want to give money,” he said. “It’s not really like they’re going to not fundraise because some people say they’re not giving.”
The senate voted unanimously to confirm the vice presidents of finance, first-year students, student enrichment, programming and student affairs, the director of student advocacy and the chief judge of the SBA Supreme Court. SBA senators Sidney Blitman and Kendall Archer will serve as the new SBA chief of staff and the new vice president of first-year students, respectively.
The senate passed five joint resolutions of appreciation for the senate, the SBA executive branch, information specialist Bobby Walis, Jacob Burns Law Library staff and law school support staff.
