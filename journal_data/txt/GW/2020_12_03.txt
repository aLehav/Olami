Last month, former Vice President Joe Biden was elected as the United States’ 46th president, amassing nearly 80 million votes – by far the most in presidential history. Running a campaign centered around the imminent need to oust the Trump-Pence regime, the Biden campaign received a number of key endorsements representing a broad and diverse coalition of voters, including marxists like Angela Davis who argued progressive voters needed to “settle for Biden” because a Biden administration can be more easily be pressured by the left.
Davis is certainly right, a Biden administration has the tools and potential to be more progressive than his predecessor. But we must not pretend we didn’t just elect a corporatist, someone who developed a racist mass incarceration infrastructure and someone who refuses to take bold action to address the climate crisis. Settling for Biden, while doing nothing else, is detrimental and will do more damage than another four years of Trump ever could. As such, it cannot be understated how important it is that the left organize to apply that “pressure” and that they work to organize, unionize, engage with their communities and create lines of support outside of electoral politics. Moving forward into a Biden presidency, the left must continue to hold Biden accountable for his promises and push for policies that will institute structural social and economic change.
Under a violent Trump presidency, direct action, political organization and collectivization have seen novel heights, and it’s crucial we don’t let the prospect of a Biden presidency pacify that. And it will be pacified if we buy into the idea that Biden, in any fundamental meaningful sense, is a better alternative, other than the fact that he just isn’t Trump, when it comes to changing the way we organize ourselves and our resources. The Trump administration has certainly raised alarm bells and caused outrage, justifiably so, but we must remember that Trump’s atrocities are nothing historically novel, and the rise of the Trump-Pence regime and its authoritarian inner workings were not accidents – they’re symptomatic of underlying structural trends in our society.
We’ve had racist presidents. We’ve had presidents grossly mishandle pandemics that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans. We’ve had presidents incarcerate and criminalize immigrants and refugees. We’ve had presidents nominate partisan judges. We’ve had presidents fund and participate in killing millions of civilians abroad. We’ve had presidents use the presidency for financial gain. We’ve had presidents isolate us from our allies, openly support dictators and we’ve had presidents participate in genocide. Looking at the devastating role the United States and its presidency have played in gross economic inequality, social injustice, terrorism, genocide, colonialism, imperialism and slavery, we should ask ourselves why our political system necessitates this violence and inequity, and why we consider it to be legitimate at all.
A Biden presidency alone, without pressure from dissident activism, presents no fundamental change toward improving the conditions of historically marginalized populations. So while voting for Biden was a first step in correcting the ills the Trump administration exposed, it can’t be the only step taken. We must continue to pay attention to the atrocities that will undoubtedly occur under the next administration, like our inhumane border policies, ruthless bombing of civilians, the gross lack of response to the murder of thousands of native women, the silent massacre of the homeless or the tens of thousands of Americans who were dying from a lack of access to health care before the pandemic. While these issues were certainly more pronounced under a Trump administration, they aren’t aberrations from the normal order and they weren’t brought by Trump – these issues are part of the inequality of American society that can’t be fixed with a series of moderate, Band-Aid policy tweaks.
We must intimately involve ourselves in mobilizing, protesting and organizing our resources in order to bring about the structural change desperately needed for the development of a just society. Push your workplace toward more liveable wages, donate or get involved with your local mutual aid networks and uplift and publicize the efforts of other dissidents. Resistance against Trump was loud and clear, it’s about time the same kind of energy is brought to the kinds of issues that have been plaguing society for decades.
It is crucial, now more than ever, that we not ease our activism, especially considering the Biden administration represents no fundamental change in the social and economic system that impedes our society. Our current lifestyle is not sustainable. Our international order kills civilian children incessantly and mercilessly promises the deaths of those who cannot afford to live. The complete reorganization of our economy, our military and our allocation of resources is non-negotiable. People are dying, and Biden’s policies do not reflect that.
A Biden presidency, while representing a break from Trump, does not represent a break from the violent injustice that dominates America. So while ousting Trump was important, it most certainly cannot, if we have any interest in the establishment of an equal society, be the only thing we do.

The political science department recently changed its bachelor of arts degree requirements, cutting the number of credits needed to graduate by almost half. This change, as explained by department faculty, is meant to give students more flexibility over their studies, but students who declared their major prior to this semester are not allowed to follow the new requirements.
With a decrease of 24 credits, students could graduate one to two semesters earlier than before, which would allow them to save a significant amount of time and money. As a sophomore who already declared my major last year, I would appreciate the opportunity to graduate earlier and have more choice in the courses I take. Students who already declared their major should be allowed to switch to these new requirements, because otherwise, it is unfair and places an unnecessary financial burden on them.
Students who declared their major early should not be punished for their proactivity. They should be allowed to either follow the new requirements under their current major declaration or redeclare their major, but both of these options are not allowed. Sophomores who could have waited until this year to declare, but chose to declare last year, now cannot take back their decision and need to complete the old number of credits. But those students are well within the allowed time range to declare a major and shouldn’t be at a disadvantage compared to their peers who haven’t declared a major.
Students are told when they declare their major that they will be expected to follow the requirements in place at the time they declare. But they usually acknowledge and agree to this because they are told it is meant to protect them from having to complete more courses in the future if requirements increase. When requirements decrease, this rule might still make sense if it was only reduced by a few credits, which may only equate to one class. But a decrease of nearly 30 credits renders these guidelines unreasonable. Holding students to the requirements in place when they declared is doing more to hurt them than help them.
In general, the number of credits students need to take is undeniably connected to the cost of their education. If students started college with AP or IB credits, they could fulfill the new credit and course requirements and complete their degree in one to two semesters less, which would significantly decrease the amount they have to pay in tuition, housing and dining. They could save tens of thousands – maybe even hundreds of thousands – of dollars by following these new requirements, so they should be given the opportunity to do so.
Beyond its tangible effects on time and money, restricting students from following the new requirements does not grant them the same flexibility and choice promised to students following the new requirements. Department faculty said under the new requirements, students would be able to pick more electives they prefer and have more choice in picking classes. College is a time when students often seek out new academic opportunities, which is particularly important in a largely research-based field like political science. A lighter course load could also allow them to explore internships and other extracurriculars in public policy that they wouldn’t otherwise pursue with a heavy workload. Students who already declared should be afforded that same opportunity. If the new requirements were created with the intention of helping students, all students deserve to enjoy that benefit.
Not allowing all students to follow these new requirements is problematic no matter the major or number of students enrolled in that major. But it is especially an issue when political science is one of the most popular majors at the University, and hundreds of students are affected by this decision. A large portion of the University could benefit from a small change that allows them to follow the new requirements, decrease their course load and graduate early.
With new degree requirements in place, students who already declared their major should be allowed to follow them. Not allowing this is unfair and could force students to pay substantially higher costs than necessary.

District guidelines mandate that dining igloos must be properly ventilated to ensure patron safety.
What started as a festive dining experience last year is expanding into a way to safeguard pods during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dining bubbles, igloos, greenhouses, yurts – whatever you want to call them – are popping up outside restaurants around the District to help keep restaurants open during the health crisis. Each bubble can’t contain more than six people, and they must be ventilated, according to D.C.’s Streatery Winter Ready guide.
Here’s a rundown of a few restaurants where you can eat inside an igloo this winter:
Del Mar
This restaurant is offering several options to dine in one of its igloos, which overlook The Wharf on the restaurant’s second floor. You can book an igloo for brunch, lunch, dinner, New Year’s Eve or Christmas Eve, and each reservation ranges between $150 and $200. Be sure to check the weather before you make a reservation – Del Mar does not open igloos in inclement weather.
791 Wharf St. SW, Tuesday through Thursday 5 to 9 p.m. Friday through Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Ted’s Bulletin
If you’re not thinking in advance to make a reservation, you can check out Ted’s Bulletin, which offers dining in one of its “snow globes” on a first-come, first-serve basis. The restaurant is opening up these plastic bubbles at its 14th Street and Barracks Row locations, and you don’t need to pay extra to eat there.
1818 14th St. NW, open daily 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Fiola Mare
Book a reservation to eat seafood in an igloo while you overlook the Georgetown Waterfront. Brunch and lunch reservations are cheaper – about $150 – while a dinner reservation charges $200. All of the igloos are heated, but the restaurant advises customers to dress warm anyway.
Georgetown Waterfront, 3100 K St. NW, Tuesday through Thursday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday & Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Monday 4:30 to 9 p.m.
The Watergate Hotel
For an upscale dining experience, head to The Watergate Hotel’s winter igloos. Rental fees range from $150 to $300, depending on the date and time, and the restaurant requests that guests spend a minimum between $50 and $70 on food and drink. The igloos are located on the Next Whisky Bar’s heated patio, according to the hotel’s website. Reservations are only required on the weekends.
2650 Virginia Ave. NW, 90 minute seatings starting at 4:30 p.m.
Bresca
This Michelin starred restaurant on 14th Street has six two-person “lodges ” in their outdoor seating area. Instead of being dome-shaped, these lodges are built with green metal poles in the shape of a small house and are wrapped in clear plastic much like those at Del Mar. But a reservation for one of these private lodges will cost you a $20 deposit each. Their menu is equally steep. They offer a la carte but also a $75 pre-fixe menu and $65 brunch menu.
1906 14th St. NW, Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Wednesday through Saturday 5 to 9 p.m.

The Board of Trustees approved a framework to reevaluate GW’s Colonials nickname in June after University President Thomas LeBlanc recognized multiple advocacy efforts from SA leaders.
The driving force behind much change at the University over the past decade has been student advocacy, often initiated by the Student Association.
Students spearheaded the push to change the Colonials moniker through a petition in May 2018 followed by an SA-led panel discussing the “negative impact” of the moniker last February. Now, officials are accepting suggestions for a name change.
Officials have also vowed to divest GW’s endowment from fossil fuels by 2025 after more than five years of SA advocacy. Administrators created academic forgiveness policies for freshmen and expanded them for all students between 2016 to 2020 after student advocacy.
Here are the top policies the SA has influenced over the decade:
Renaming the Colonial moniker 
A movement to change the Colonials moniker surfaced in May 2018 when students launched the first petition on GW Voice – an SA-run platform for students to advertise petitions – to change the moniker to the “Hippos” or “Revolutionaries.”
SA senators hosted panel discussions with faculty in February 2019 to talk about the history of the moniker in hopes of pressuring officials to review name change submissions to replace the nickname. Later that academic year, more than half of the student body voted in favor of a referendum to change the nickname.
SA leaders outlined a framework for a task force on the moniker in September 2019, and the Board of Trustees created a building name task force in November of that year to reconsider building names and the moniker. Former SA Sen. André Gonzales, the chair of the SA building and naming task force, said at the time that the University has the opportunity to hold a “unique conversation” to reevaluate its moniker with GW’s bicentennial coming up in 2021.
“We need to make sure that we are, No. 1, honoring the legacy of this University but also honoring the legacy that current students want this University to have,” Gonzales said in an interview last September.
Most recently, the Board approved a framework to reevaluate GW’s Colonials nickname in June after University President Thomas LeBlanc recognized multiple advocacy efforts, like referendums and student task forces, from SA leaders.
Divestment from fossil fuels 
Sunrise GW, then known as Fossil Free GW, began pressuring administrators as early as fall 2013 to break ties with fossil fuels companies, like ExxonMobil. SA senators initiated a referendum on the 2015 election ballot, which garnered 70 percent of students voting to divest.
From 2015 to 2017, trustees declined to communicate divestment options to Board members and rejected the option to divest altogether. The SA Senate voted to call on officials to divest in 2016.
Student advocacy for a fossil-free campus spiked last fall when Fossil Free GW became a chapter of the Sunrise Movement – hosting multiple demonstrations – and SA senators also backed the movement. An overwhelming majority of students later approved a 2020 SA election referendum, and LeBlanc announced in late June that the University will completely divest from fossil fuels by 2025.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said student voices contributed to a call for divestment through the Environmental, Social and Governance Responsibility Task Force – specifically undergraduate students and task force members Jeremy Liskar and Jillian Webber – to help develop the institutional statement on environmental responsibility.
The ESG Task Force released a draft statement in June on sustainability recommendations for the University on the task force’s website – where roughly 100 community members entered feedback regarding the drafted statement, she said.
Nosal said Peter Harrison, a Board member and the chair of the task force, hosted two community town halls over the summer, which gathered more than 100 student, faculty and alumni participants.
“We are currently working with our leadership team to designate responsible parties for each of the recommendations,” Nosal said in an email in September. “Carrying out our plan to divest from fossil fuels will be a joint effort between University leadership and the Office of Sustainability in partnership with the University’s outsourced chief investment officer.”
Nosal declined to say how the University will pay for the roughly $1 million cost of divesting from fossil fuels.
Academic forgiveness 
Former SA Executive Vice President and current SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G, spearheaded the push to launch an academic forgiveness policy in 2016. The SA Senate passed legislation in support of the policy in January 2017, and the Faculty Senate approved the policy the next month to be reviewed again in three years.
More than 500 students used the policy after its first year – retaking one course in which they received a D+ or lower.
SA senators passed legislation earlier this year to expand the policy to allow all students, instead of just freshmen, to retake up to three courses during their undergraduate years. The Faculty Senate approved the expansion in May.
“It really was a collaborative effort, and the administrators were all on board for it,” Falcigno said in a May interview. “From what I understand, not many of them had any concerns, and they expressed to me that this was a policy in the direction of where they wanted to go, and they just didn’t have student support for it.”
Student seats on the Board of Trustees 
Then-SA President Erika Feinman included advocacy for a student seat on the Board in their 2016 campaign after the SA passed a resolution in favor of adding the seat in 2014. Board members created a task force in August 2016 considering a student seat, and task force members submitted a 63-page document of recommendations to increase student voices on the Board in May 2017.
“The recommendations that we gave are specific and outline what we feel would be the best process in terms of selection processes, orientations, terms – really every kind of detail that goes into creating a student representation model,” Feinman said in an interview at the time.
Following meetings between Board members and SA leaders in August 2017, the Board amended its bylaws to allow one non-voting student into the body. Then-SA President SJ Matthews served as the non-voting member on the Board during the 2019-20 academic year and sponsored a referendum on the 2020 SA election ballot to add a student position with voting rights, which passed with 93.7 percent student approval.
Grace Speights, the chair of the Board, said in April that the members were not considering adding a student voter to the body.
“We have no immediate plans to make additional changes, but the Board will continue to consider the views of our community as we move forward,” Speights said.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
My last real day of college was a Friday with the kind of spring weather that usually brings all of GW to sprawl across University Yard and Kogan Plaza. The cherry blossoms at the Tidal Basin were nearing peak bloom, but the ones near The Hatchet’s townhouse had already bloomed.
I went to the 609 21st Street building that March morning as a reflex. Fridays are our news team work days. But given that we had already spent the week writing sentences that ended in “amid the COVID-19 pandemic,” I’m not sure why I expected anyone to be there.
I sat in the empty newsroom for half an hour, finishing up work and trying to take my mind off of the disconcerting silence that had already filled the townhouse and Foggy Bottom. I was happy to have the company of two other news editors when I returned to the building later that day, where we covered the first of many online Faculty Senate meetings.
We said goodbye to the townhouse when we left, not really knowing when we might see it again as we loved it most – full of conversation like it had been just a week earlier. Fridays might have been for working, but they were also a time to create inside jokes, bond with new reporters and learn about our campus.
I have never felt more supported and fulfilled than I did leaving the townhouse at 5 p.m., knowing that I had helped someone with their work and someone had helped me. I always felt that I had learned something about GW or D.C. that day.
Most Fridays ended there – tired and happy from a day of reporting and writing. But the best ones ended at the Kennedy Center, where I would spend the evening watching a ballet. These days were my reminders of what I loved about the District and how lucky I was to be learning there.
Courtesty of Ilena Peng
It’s hard to find that same inspiration in a pandemic. My bedroom is a weak replacement for SMPA, the Kennedy Center or 609 21st Street, but there have still been moments of contentment. I finally had the opportunity to work outside of The Hatchet’s news section. I held a plank for two minutes. I made a video for my senior capstone that I was proud of, even though none of the interviews could be done in person.
I never imagined that I would be writing this article at home in the same place where I wrote my senior column for my high school newsmagazine. I always thought I’d be writing this on a Friday in The Hatchet’s worn-out but well-loved townhouse. But I am happy to be writing it nonetheless, with the same gratitude I always knew I’d feel when I left GW.
Saying I’m grateful for GW is really just a blanket statement to express how fortunate I feel to have met so many incredible people at this university. What follows is a list of some of those people.
Shanny – My Hatchet ballet buddy! I have been in awe of you since the first academics meeting, when you showed up at 8 p.m. on a random Tuesday with a perfect outfit and makeup. I know your dedication to the work that you do, from writing for The Hatchet to choreographing for Balance, will take you so far (but also remember to rest, of course). I miss talking about ballet with you everywhere – in the townhouse, at the monuments, during intermissions – and hope we will get to enjoy a live show together soon enough.
Lizzie – Thank you for guiding me through my first two positions on The Hatchet, introducing me to the concept of putting tater tots on pizza and taking many walks with me. Some of your food takes are mildly terrible but as your Hatchet little, I will always aspire to have just a bit of the tenacity that you approach your work with.
Jared – I remember being so excited the first time you edited my article as SNE because I knew you would be such an excellent leader. SNE is such a tough job, and I know it’s even harder with an entire volume online, but I have been constantly impressed by everything the news team has covered so far. I can’t wait to see what you do next. And thank you for being one of my closest friends on The Hatchet – it was a privilege to be a star baby, research assistant and news editor with you.
Ciara – You are such a sweet, dedicated person. I’m so proud of the work you’ve done, especially since event coverage has changed so much during the pandemic – I could not have thought of a better blog editor for this volume. It’s unfortunate that we weren’t closer before this semester, but it’s better late than never. I will miss your laughter in the townhouse, in the classroom and everywhere else. We all couldn’t help but laugh with you too!
Lia – You will always be a metro queen to me, even though you’re in health and sciences now, but the truth is that you excel at whatever you do. I’ve been lucky enough to be both your editor and your reporter, and you are one of the most reliable people I know. Your interesting remarks and your love for rats will haunt me, but they will also be some of my favorite memories of The Hatchet.
Zach – You practically lit up when you worked, like that time you reported on license plates and when we wrote an article on D.C. politics an entire week early, before we had even finished our drafts for the current issue. That excitement about your work always cheered me up, even that one time that our reporting day was going so poorly that we had to entirely swap positions to have any luck getting things done. And on an entirely separate note, I really will miss seeing “The Order of the Arrow” in my Zoom meetings.
Tiffany & Makena – Both of you brought such a wonderful energy to the newsroom from the time you started out as reporters, and I could tell that we had some Hatchet greats in the making. The two of you handle one of the hardest beats on the news team but make it look easy. You are truly a power team, and I look forward to all that you will do in the second half of the volume.
Alec – Yet another original member of team academics! I’ve always known you were a good reporter, but I’m continually surprised by the naturalness with which you approach new mediums, like podcasting.
Aaron – It was such a privilege to be on the small but mighty web team with you. Everything you create for The Hatchet is so beautiful, and I’m glad to have seen the behind-the-scenes work that goes into it all.
Falyn – You are one of the kindest and smartest people I know. I’ve always appreciated your company during our 8 a.m. class or 6 p.m. class or our 2.5-hour-long classes in general. And thank you for recommending Sweetgreen’s chicken and brussels salad. Hopefully we can get one together again soon!
Lauren – I was in good hands with you as my first editor at The Hatchet, and your willingness to trust me with so many stories forced me to learn quickly. I’m inspired by all the work you do now and can’t wait to keep reading your articles when you become the amazing political journalist that you’re already shaping up to be.
Parth – Part of the reason I took so many blogs when I joined The Hatchet was because you always made the process run smoothly, even if I forgot to respond to your texts for two hours (sorry again). As SNE, you constantly had our backs, all while being the reliable source of humor that we all love to hate you for. There was no such thing as a boring newsroom when you were there, even when we were covering the first of many virtual Faculty Senates on the loneliest Friday ever. Blogz editors emeritus 4ever!
Dani – When I first joined metro, I kept hearing about you as the perfect example of a Hatchet-life work balance that I hadn’t thought was possible. Watching you in action as SNE, I continued to be amazed by the grace with which you handled your job (and Parth’s shenanigans). In some ways, I am glad I never had to spend a newsroom work day without either you or Parth there because it really wouldn’t be the same.
Sarah – Thank you for guiding me when I was a reporter starting to write student life stories and for trusting me as a staff member when I was figuring out where I wanted to be on staff. There is plenty more I could say, but I don’t think I need to – all of us on staff are thankful our leader is someone as thoughtful, smart and kind as you.
Anjini – Though we are usually on separate coasts, college wouldn’t have been the same without you. Thank you for watching meteor showers with me, editing so many essays/texts/emails and introducing me to earl grey tea, among many other things.
To my professors – It has been an incredible privilege to study at GW and at SMPA. Without you all, I wouldn’t have a lot of the skills I now consider second nature. I wouldn’t have a sense of direction of where I wanted to be after graduation either. Thank you for all your support, knowledge and advice.
To my family – For making all of this possible.
-30-

It's December, which means the Christmas Tree outside the White House will be lit every night for viewing.
Believe it or not, it’s the first week of December. Between finals breaks, get in the holiday spirit by checking out the National Christmas Tree, watching the virtual premiere of BalletMet’s “The Nutcracker’ and getting cozy by an outdoor fire at The Wharf for a screening of “Elf.”
Friday
The National Christmas Tree
If you’re in Foggy Bottom this holiday season, the National Christmas Tree is only a short walk away. This huge tree sits just behind the White House on the northeast side of The Ellipse and is surrounded by smaller trees decorated with ornaments from all 50 states. The tree lighting ceremony was pre-recorded this year due to COVID-19 concerns, but the 30-foot Colorado Blue Spruce will be lit every night this month for viewing.
The Ellipse, 15th & E streets NW. Tree lit from sunset to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, sunset to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Tickets are free.
Saturday
The Hip Hop Nutcracker by The National Theater
“The Nutcracker” is a long-standing holiday tradition for ballet studios across the world, but this year The National Theater is putting on a virtual Nutcracker with a spin. Though the storyline of the ballet is the same, this hip hop remix incorporates 12 “all-star” dancers, a DJ, a violinist and hip hop icon MC Kurtis Blow. You can either watch the performance live or purchase a ticket to watch for a certain amount of time afterward.
Virtual show starts at 7 p.m. Tickets are $20 for live show, $50 for VIP.
Sunday
“Elf” at The Wharf
Gather your roommates and head to The Wharf for a screening of everyone’s favorite holiday movie “Elf.” Tickets are purchased per group of four, and attendees get to enjoy a complimentary seat around their own fire pit while they watch the movie. The film will be screened on a 20-foot LED screen so guests can spread out and still have a good view. Drinks and snacks will be sold by Catina Bambina if you’re looking for movie munchies.
Transit Pier at The Wharf, 970 Wharf St. SW, screenings at 2 and 6 p.m. Tickets are $60 per group of 4.

George, a health care IT executive, said the FBA must navigate through continuous remote operation during the COVID-19 pandemic, but he said he hopes to conduct in-person meetings next year “where appropriate.”
Local community members elected a new president of the Foggy Bottom Association and charted plans to guide the neighborhood through the year ahead during an annual meeting Tuesday.
The FBA elected John George to serve as president of the neighborhood association for the next three years, succeeding Marina Streznewski, who helped manage the neighborhood group for more than seven years. George said he plans to “engage and involve” a diverse group of locals to unify residents around Foggy Bottom and the West End and rally support for small businesses struggling through the COVID-19 pandemic.
George, who ran unopposed, was ushered in with 27 members voting in favor of his election and two opposed. George was elected along with four other members of the body’s board of directors.
The two opposing votes came from James Harnett, a senior and the chair of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, and Trupti Patel, the ANC’s treasurer who defeated George during the ANC’s general election race.
“I’m looking forward to leading the board and working with the community as we set our course for the next three years,” George said at the meeting.
The FBA functions as a neighborhood association of local residents who meet on a monthly basis to discuss matters and updates facing the community. In addition to the president, at least eight other members serve on the body’s board of directors, a third of which are elected annually.
As the outgoing leader of the community, Streznewski noted how the pandemic has been the single unsolved issue that has exacerbated problems facing the neighborhood like homelessness, small business funding, employment and public health – concerns that need to be addressed by the association’s incoming leadership.
“Right now to be completely honest with you, it’s the COVID pandemic,” she said. “It’s affecting absolutely everything that we do.”
George, a health care IT executive, said the FBA must navigate through continuous remote operation during the COVID-19 pandemic, but he said he hopes to conduct in-person meetings next year “where appropriate.” He said the FBA should also maintain communication with city leaders like Ward 2 D.C. Council member Brooke Pinto and Mayor Muriel Bowser to continue engaging the neighborhood for the next three years.
“We have a wonderfully diverse community here, and you can name the terms around what is diverse to you, but it is clearly a unique spot in the District of Columbia,” George said. “And we are very blessed in many ways for not only our community members but the services and other amenities we have in the area.”
George also presented the results of a neighborhood survey he conducted during his bid for the ANC, which displayed the issues that local residents viewed as most vital to the neighborhood. Surveyed residents value local green space the most, followed by the need to address homelessness, upholding “a positive relationship” with GW and combatting rodent infestation, according to the presentation.
Other priorities in the survey included improving the conditions of the local playground and dog park, maintaining the Arts in Foggy Bottom exhibit, fostering “a vibrant community” for local commerce and addressing the economic effects of the pandemic.
“I thought tonight would be interesting just to share with this community what these survey respondents said,” George said. “They may or may not represent your views, but I think it was a good telling because there was a number of people who indicated what was important to them as it related to living in our area.”
The FBA also elected four community members to serve as at-large members of the association’s board of directors during the meeting. George said one of his priorities is to create a “cohesive” board as the group prepares to appoint officers to serve as vice president, secretary and treasurer.
As the FBA enters the new year, George said the group will look ahead to progressing toward an eventual switch to in-person operation and engaging in the group’s traditional spring neighborhood cleanup efforts in 2021. He said the FBA will continue to meet monthly as the board prepares to guide the association’s community building in the later stages of the pandemic.
“Communication is key, especially now because we are living under different circumstances, and we need to keep engaging,” George said. “I think all of us feel that. So part of it is continuing even in this virtual way.”

Sophomore guard James Bishop moves the ball up the court during a game against Hampton Tuesday. The Colonials dropped the matchup 82–78.
Seconds after the opening tip, Hampton launched an off-target triple. Sophomore guard Chris Shelton recovered the offensive rebound, and Hampton made another attempt from deep that missed the net. A second offensive board from Shelton led to a layup in the paint that put the Pirates on the board first.
Second chance points made all the difference in men’s basketball’s 82–78 loss to Hampton Tuesday. The Pirates (1-0) collected 15 offensive boards to the Colonials’ (0-2) five, resulting in a 16-2 swing in second-chance points.
“I felt like our defense, our rotations were better,” Christian said. “You’ve just got to continue to work to get better, to know where we have to be a little bit tougher. And I felt like they had a couple wild shots at the end of the shot clock because we didn’t have a sense of urgency.”
Turnovers were another point of contention for GW. In its first game of the season, the Colonials turned the ball over 16 times at Navy. Against Hampton, the Colonials committed 17 turnovers.
“Seventeen turnovers hurt us again,” Christian said. “Those are opportunities where we’re scoring the ball at such a high level right now, especially at the free throw line, and we get those down to 12 and 13, like normal, we’re in a pretty good place. We’re just not there yet. And we’re under construction.”
The Pirates’ shooters were less efficient than the Colonials, firing at a 39.7 percent clip compared to the Colonials’ 46.6 percent. But Hampton made 20 more shot attempts, including 21 points from GW turnovers.
Three-point shots also landed better for Hampton than GW. GW’s zone defense forced the Pirates to the perimeter, and they netted 10-of-33 from deep, but GW could only sink 3-of-16. The Colonials went cold from behind the arc in the second frame, missing all six attempts.
“I’m encouraged because I feel like that we took a step offensively because the quality of shots we’re getting were excellent, but we definitely have to finish them,” Christian said. “That would have changed the outcome.”
Sophomore guard James Bishop said guarding the perimeter was a key part of the game plan, but the squad wasn’t able to fully execute.
“That was a big point of emphasis when we came in, and we just came up short in getting them off the line stopping them from shooting threes,” Bishop said.
Bishop carried the night for GW, posting a career-high 22 points and seven assists. Graduate transfer forward Matt Moyer, sophomore guard Jameer Nelson Jr. and sophomore forward Jamison Battle combined for 40 points and 20 rebounds. For the first time in his GW career, Battle did not make a triple despite five attempts.
Hampton started the scoring off with four straight points before GW responded with a five-point tilt to take a marginal lead. The first half would see 10 lead changes as both teams jockeyed for an advantage.
A triple and block by senior guard Maceo Jack put GW out front, and a commanding dunk from Moyer gave the Colonials a six-point lead – their largest lead of the first half.
GW’s perimeter defense produced stops for the first 10 minutes of the half, but it began to fizzle after Hampton sank three consecutive triples. Christian called a time out just under half way through the frame to regroup, and the Colonials regained the lead, riding a 10-4 run in the next three minutes.
Hampton answered with a run of its own and ended the half with a slim 37–33 lead.
The second frame started with shaky ball handling on both sides, clocking a combined five turnovers in the first two and a half minutes. Two made free throws from Jack and a layup from Battle evened the score, and the two squads stayed close for the first half of the frame.
Sophomore forward Chase Paar finished in traffic to put GW up by seven, but that lead quickly evaporated as Hampton’s sharpshooters launched rockets from long distance.
GW partly made up for the offensive disparity by taking advantage of Hampton’s foul trouble. The Colonials forced 30 trips to the charity stripe – 21 attempts in the second frame – and were rewarded with 21 points from free throws. The team cleaned up its shooting percentage from the line, improving 9.1 percent from its first outing.
The Colonials had it tied at 74 points apiece with just more than three minutes to go, but they watched the game slip out of their reach with an 8-4 Hampton run to close out the contest 82–78.
“We all could play harder,” Bishop said. “I don’t think it’s necessarily what we could have done on the offensive end. I think it all boils down to just effort and playing harder.”
Next up, the Colonials will seek their first win of the season on the road against Towson Monday. Tipoff is slated for 7 p.m.

Feldman said the group was inspired by the 2000 United Nations Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security, which calls for the increased participation of women in all U.N. peace and security efforts.
Officials from the Elliott School of International Affairs launched a program last month to provide scholarships and networking opportunities for female Elliott School students.
Ilana Feldman, the school’s interim dean, said although the International Women of Elliott program “formally” launched during the summer, the program’s official public launch was on Nov. 16, with an event on the need for equal opportunities for women in education, government and the economy around the world. Feldman said the program’s membership revenue will be used entirely for scholarships and fellowships for female Elliott School students, who will receive career advising and mentorship opportunities.
She said more than 30 students indicated an interest in the program after it was first announced in August with an additional 80 students registered for the program’s inaugural event and said officials have seen an “incredibly strong and positive” response from students to the program.
“Student interest is only continuing to grow as I/WE expands its programming and collaborates with student groups for various events and networking,” Feldman said in an email.
She said the group was inspired by the 2000 United Nations Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security, which calls for the increased participation of women in all U.N. peace and security efforts.
“In accord with this resolution, the Elliott School launched I/WE – the GW International Women of Elliott,” Feldman said. “The leadership group is designed to raise the global visibility and connectivity of women leaders in the Elliott community, bringing women from all stages in their careers together for dialogue on the unique opportunities and challenges they face.”
She said the program provided an opportunity for Elliott School alumnae and current students to meet and connect with each other to utilize the “rich experience and expertise” the alumnae have. The program includes 21 members of an “executive circle,” representing various industries and sectors, she said.
“These leading women will help shape the group’s activities and programming, providing a wide range of ideas and experiences to share with Elliott School students and alumni,” she said.
Feldman said the program “touches on” all four goals from the Elliott School’s diversity action plan, which includes building a supportive community, growing the number of minority students, increasing the number of resources devoted to diversity efforts and developing a communications plan.
She said women are historically underrepresented in the field of international relations, and the network of alumnae that the program seeks to develop will encourage collaboration on developing the skills necessary to diversify the field.
“Through these efforts, I/WE will be another avenue to draw underrepresented faculty and staff to the school, fostering tighter connections and building a talent pipeline by creating awareness of the successes of women in the field of international affairs and at the Elliott School,” Feldman said.
She said diversity is a “cornerstone” of the program, and officials wanted to ensure the group’s leadership represents various diverse backgrounds and a range of career paths. More than one-third of the program’s executive circle members are from a “diverse background,” and many of them have experience in the public sector, the private sector and the nonprofit world, she said.
“In addition to the two co-chairs, Julie Monaco and Susan Stautberg, the school recently confirmed the participation of Ambassador Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley as vice chair, ensuring that no level of leadership is without representation of race and professional background,” Feldman said.

DCist reported that the selection of shuttered stations will look similar to those closed at the onset of the pandemic, which included the Smithsonian and Arlington stations.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is proposing historic service cutbacks for fiscal year 2022 amid a financial crisis and massive budget shortfall during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under a current agency proposal released Monday, WMATA could eliminate all weekend rail service, shut down 19 stations, terminate nearly 20 of its 41 bus routes, end weekday rail service at 9 p.m. and extend the gap between some train arrivals to 30 minutes on weekdays. The budget cuts also include plans to sever 1,000 more working positions than previously intended, with the total projection now standing at 2,400 workers who will either be laid off or accept $15,000 buyouts if they’re eligible for retirement.
The budget cuts serve as an example of how the pandemic has crippled the public transportation system across the country, where ridership has plummeted under health concerns, stay-at-home orders and in-person business closures.
“In the face of a historic budget shortfall, the Proposed FY2022 Budget preserves barebones service to sustain essential travel and to ensure the network is in place to serve regional recovery,” the proposal states. “Preserving even this limited service requires contributions from all stakeholders.”
Paul Wiedefeld, Metro’s general manager and CEO, said officials decided to cut weekend service, when ridership is lowest, according to DCist. Officials will expand bus service to account for the Metrorail’s closure, DCist reported.
“Any cut is painful,” Wiedefeld said in a call with local reporters. “That’s just the reality of what we’re up against right now.”
DCist reported that the selection of shuttered stations will look similar to those closed at the onset of the pandemic, which included the Smithsonian and Arlington stations. Metro currently operates trains every eight to 15 minutes, and the proposal states officials will maintain 15-minute arrival times at some of the city’s busier stations around Metro’s “core.”
Officials also plan to reinstate “turnbacks” in which trains would turn around and return to the center of the District instead of traveling further out into suburban areas, which would increase wait times for those in D.C.-area suburbs, according to DCist. Metro’s proposal states the agency will still open the second phase of Silver Line construction in July 2021 despite its other budget cuts.
DCist reported that Metro’s service reductions are “the grimmest in its 50-year history,” as officials hope to meet a $500 million deficit that has plagued the agency during the COVID-19 pandemic. After first projecting $680 million in fare revenue during FY21 before the pandemic, the report states Metro officials now plan to collect only $117 million this fiscal year with an increase to $172 million next year.
Metro officials project they will recover up to 20 percent of pre-pandemic ridership levels by the end FY21, and they expect to reach 34 percent during FY22, according to WMATA’s proposal presentation.
Anticipating upcoming budget cuts earlier this semester, students said service scalebacks would complicate their travel schedules if trains were to arrive at stations less frequently than before the pandemic struck.
Metro first started to dial down service in late March when the COVID-19 outbreak swept across the region as officials slowed train circulations and shuttered nearly 20 stations. After resuming pre-pandemic service levels once cases stalled in the region in August, officials reversed reopenings last month with plans to return to fare collection on Metrobuses and “less frequent” rail service in 2021.
WMATA has leaned on CARES Act funding to offset the financial fallout heralded by its revenue dropoff, but that funding expired at the end of July and is expected to run out in March. Congress has yet to pass another relief package, but Wiedefeld said the agency could alleviate the potential service overhaul if lawmakers can reach an agreement before April or May.
A group of bipartisan senators presented a $908 billion stimulus proposal Tuesday in an effort to rush a relief package through Congress and into the hands of Americans and local governments after months of disagreement, raising hopes that federal funding could soon be on the way.
Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a statement following Metro’s budget announcement, calling on federal lawmakers to set aside partisan differences and agree on a relief bill to “save” the Metro.
“WMATA’s deeply troubling proposal is another reminder of the critical need for federal stimulus to revive our economy and to preserve our way of life,” she said in a tweet. “Not too long ago with our federal government, we put Metro on the right track to meet the needs of residents and visitors alike. Regardless of party or ideology, we must once again come together to save Metro.”
Paul Smedberg, the chair of Metro’s board, said although officials had to plan without the expectation that the agency would receive federal funding, he remains optimistic that legislators will recognize the need to save public transportation, according to The Washington Post.
“They really want to see transit survive,” Smedberg told the Post. “So they’re really concerned about this, obviously, and want to do everything that they can to support us given all the investment over the years, and decades, really, that this region and its elected leaders have put into this.”
WMATA officials will present the FY22 budget proposals to Metro’s board Friday, and the board will listen to public hearings and comments until February before their final vote on the budget in March, the Post reported.
If approved, the budget cuts will go into effect in July 2021 when FY22 begins, according to WMATA’s proposal.
