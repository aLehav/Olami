Forgive me for all the line breaks; I had to fill up this 30-piece somehow.
I can’t believe it’s over. Working on a two-man web team at The Hatchet was more than a challenge. Uploading a paper’s worth of content twice a week can take quite a toll on a full-time student also maintaining an internship. I usually started around midnight and almost always worked late into the next morning. Special guide issues were especially daunting, but I took solace in knowing that they would eventually look fantastic reproduced on the website the next day. That is what kept me going. Helping to produce a great online product is what motivated me to come back into the townhouse every production night.
I was brought on staff freshman year as a cartoonist for Opinions. A little later I was invited to join the web team. What a journey. As a web producer and manager, I’ve grown tremendously. I’m lucky to have learned so much outside of GW classes. Though I’ve gained invaluable experience, what was most fulfilling was working alongside my friends. The Hatchet’s biggest strength is undoubtedly the dedicated students who run it.
Looking back, I can say wholeheartedly that I’m proud to have been apart of such a great publication.
Now I suppose I’ll thank everyone who made my time here memorable:
Connor: I’ve never watched so many YouTube videos with any one person. Your diligent work ethic and sense of humor made getting through those long hours bearable. Along the way we have probably discovered more about each other than two coworkers should. But seriously, I didn’t think it was humanly possible to function on such little sleep until I met you. It still baffles me how you were able to master the Uberman’s sleep schedule while still attending school full time. The sheer amount of coding knowledge and web development skills you have is extraordinary. Without you the site would never have gotten this far. You’re hands down the best webmaster I’ve had the pleasure of working with. Now that we’ve come to the end, I think you can truly say, “Harry, I’ve reached the top.”
Priya: You’ve been a great leader at The Hatchet. The paper and staff are certainly better for having you. You’ve been a great boss but an even better friend. Thanks for everything.
Traynor: It’s astounding how easy it was to coax you into getting that fake tattoo where you got it. My only regret is not pressuring you into getting a real one. I am sorry though that I misspelled your name that one time. Who knew accidentally adding a single character could be so inflammatory?
Bowman: Sorry I high-fived. But you deserve it for guilt-tripping me into selling my Krispy Kreme stock – it has doubled since then. As for my obliterated heap of a phone, you have my forgiveness. Also, tell Snowballs I said hello.
Allison: You asked to be in my 30-piece so here you are. Hey there.
Rachel: It was a pleasure working with you. Thanks for the fun times; we certainly had a few memorable moments. Also, my knowledge of NY has tripled since meeting you. I am forever grateful.
French: I have to thank you for bringing me on board. Joining staff was a great decision. I wish you the best.
Justin: When I was a freshman you made an effort to make me feel like I was apart of staff. Thank you buddy.
Jordan: You’re absolutely right.
Annu: You always lighten the mood. I have to thank you for simply being so upbeat when others weren’t.
Ryan & Amanda: Your snarky sense of humor is what motivated me to come in early few times. Keep up the good work.
Gabe: You sometimes stress me out but that’s quite all right. You have a creative vision that I very much envy.
Francis: Thanks for being a good roommate. Living with you was definitely an experience.
TV by the window: Thank you for your weekly broadcast of The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. Otherwise, I might not have made it.
Cory and Ferris: Good luck next year with volume 110. Having known you guys over years, I can rest assured knowing the paper will be great hands. And just remember, if you ever need help with the website next year I will have changed my phone number by then. Tracking me down will be very difficult so don’t try. If you need any technical assistance try this new website I found: http://www.Google.com.
Mom, Dad, Grandma & Dawana: Thanks for all your support. You’ve always been my biggest fans. I’ve gotten this far because of you — for that I will always be grateful.

Editor in chief Priya Anand's desk features three things she can't live without: coffee, hot sauce and Hatchets.
Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
If you only fall in love once, I’m screwed.
That’s the only thing I’ve been able to think while writing a final thousand-or-so words for The Hatchet.
This farewell is supposed to encapsulate my entire collegiate journalism journey. It’s supposed to be a goodbye, a thank you to coworkers, a brief memoir of the countless nights you barely slept, and leapt out of bed to chase cop cars or fire trucks. You can only hope it conveys to your readers how much this damn newspaper changed everything about your life. Or how this dumpy, dilapidated townhouse became your home. Or how you feel like you’re losing a really big chunk of your identity and heart with every character you type onto this page.
I couldn’t bring myself to write this until the very last moment – the night before my final production, then the morning of, then that night. Until after there were no stories left to edit, no issues to plan. Until my last issue as editor in chief hit the printer, and hours before I’d be forced to delete the email signature that shows I’m a proud staff member of this beautiful institution. Until Connor was yelling at me at 5 a.m. to just finish this stupid thing.
I downed coffee, beer and more coffee in an attempt to accept this finality and find the words to accurately describe what these last three or four years have meant. Still, these words won’t tell you enough. There’s no way to tell you enough.
***
No words will be sufficient enough to show how grateful I am that Lauren gave me stories as a baby freshman and quickly after brought me on staff, the biggest turning point in my life. Or how Emily was the lifeline who taught me what news is and how to write, likely turning into the most influential person in my Hatchet career, one who I could turn to for years after her graduation for both friendship and advice.
If it wasn’t for Amy, I wouldn’t know anything about metro news. Her endless support meant more than she will ever know, and Morgenstern made me feel like a member of team news even as a sophomore.
When you’re the new kid in the townhouse, it’s hard to feel like you’re worthy of joining the personalities whose photos hang on these peeling, Smurf-blue walls. But then you meet seniors like Justin Guiffre, Becky and Louis, who make you feel like you can join the cool kids’ table.
I don’t know how to describe where my experience ends and Annu’s begins, or that time we laid the groundwork for our best-friendship over a pizza in Ocean City a few months later. She is the kindest, smartest and most sincere human being I’ve ever met, and I don’t know how I got lucky enough to call myself her best friend. Who else would I eat coffee grinds and jalapeños with?
Gabriella is my rock – the best, most understanding roommate I could have ever asked for. Words will never be able to match the breathtaking beauty of her photographs. She’s so goddamn talented, and I know she will excel. She already does.
I’ve given Gabe shit so often because I consider him very much my own. I’ll always envy and admire his ability to make people laugh even in dismal situations, and be thankful for his candor.
Connor has got to know at this point that being his coworker and friend (admit it!) has been among my favorite things about The Hatchet this year. If I can pick up even tiny elements of what he knows, I’ll be thrilled. This guy is going places. And somewhere between plotting how to take over the Internet – or help The Hatchet do that better – and driving across the city at 4 a.m., I realized our friendship is one that I sincerely hope will continue. Coffee? Bier Baron? Coffee while we walk to the Bier Baron?
Sarah’s partnership is what made this year. Without her, The Hatchet would not have accomplished all it did. I’ll miss finishing each other’s sentences and staying up until the sunrise. Ok, maybe not the second part. But farm girl’s incredibly capable, and I can’t wait to see where she takes the paper.
My successor and dearest of friends, Cory, will help this paper reach new heights. I’ll be around (or on Gchat) when things get rough, but I’m sure he will be more than just fine. Rock it. Be tough. Have fun. This is the best job you’ll ever have.
Traynor’s prolific writing never ceased to blow my mind. Maybe life will let us become coworkers for a third time. If it does, there better be more cookies the size of our faces.
If you think the humanities are utterly unemployable, you’ve clearly never met Patrick. He is among the hardest-working people I’ve ever met, and the opinions section benefitted from his dedication. Also, no. I don’t recall. Doug, find something else to hack next year and I’ll repay you with white food.
The most worthwhile thing to ever come out of an ANC meeting was my friendship with Jordan, who teaches everyone he meets what true fun actually is. I promise to get through at least three pages of the public health book he will eventually write without falling asleep. Prom!
Chloe is going to kill it – she’s already exceeded expectations. Look out for her byline. #adopted forever. I’ll always be her No. 1 fan.
Brianna, my little one, has come so far. And she’s not stopping anytime soon. I knew from the start that she was a keeper. Isn’t chasing cops fun?
Copy is, simply put, fucking insane. I’m glad to have had Amanda and Ryan by my side every late night, along with the laughter, snacks and crudity. They have a gift. Please record Bohemian Copsody for me.
Francis will always be my partner in (breaking news) crime. I hope he knows that nothing will ever get in his way of success besides him.
I’m going to maintain that Dev is one of the most underrated, funny staffers. He made crashing with team web worth losing sleep.
Late-night chats with Allison are what made us friends and gave me a reason to look forward to the end of production. Serena’s stories were hilarious and she was a joy to have on staff.
Lisa and I will always have the pumpkin squares. And sriracha. And coffee. I’m glad she jumped into the very, very deep end of the pool just because I asked.
The coolest kid on staff was Nick Rice, hands down. With that personality, creativity and work ethic, he is bound to succeed.
Karolina, Justin and Nick have grown so much this year and I know culture, ops and sports will be in good hands. Yes, Justin, you can still pester me on Gchat. Jenna, you are already doing great. It’ll be a good year.
Being a news assignment editor is a rough job, but Jeremy can do it. He’s got the spark.
Sam and Delaney are consistently hard-working and will only do good things for team photo next year.
It’s hard to say how I’ll ever repay every former EIC who I’ve bugged on Gchat, or over email or coffee for advice, criticism and help. Thank you. Tim, our talks have meant more than you know, and I’m so glad we became friends.
Nothing compares to the summer of sunshine with Becky, or the endless cheer Anne, Michelle and Marie bring everywhere they go.
I don’t know when I’ll ever have an office again, but when I do, I hope I have a couch so Sammy can nap there, too. One of my first friends since freshman year has grown into one of my best, and there is nobody who can make me smile faster than him.
I’ve missed Lyndsey and Rachel, but know we will make up for lost weekends this year for the next 80 to come. These girls are my anchors, and 718’s space in my heart has only swelled. Meow.
For a long time, I have wondered how to write to my sister Pooja, or explain the degree to which she has been a force in my life. She is my leveler, my confidant, my best friend, my other half and the reason I stay sane. I can’t thank her or my dad enough for their unconditional love. I can’t thank my mom enough for passing on her moxie – it’s probably why I’m a reporter.
***
I discovered my burning passion for journalism when I fell in love with The Hatchet four years ago, around the same time I developed an inhuman addiction to coffee and indifference toward sleep.
For four years, I have been known as the Hatchet girl. For four years, our 2140 G St. office has been my mailing address. For four years, people have asked me “How’s The Hatchet?” in lieu of “How are you?”
I could write more, but no words will ever be enough. They’ll never capture that this newspaper is perhaps the biggest piece of my heart.
It’s time to let this goodbye publish. My love, along with 324 bylines and some photos on the walls, will remain with The GW Hatchet.

Today, still wanted by the government, Connor Jennings survives as a soldier of fortune. If you have a problem...if no one else can help...and if you can find him...maybe you can hire...Connor Jennings.
Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
It was about 20 minutes into my drive from Philadelphia to D.C. that I realized I was heading the wrong direction on I-95. The sensation you get when you realize you’re not where you thought you were is unpleasant, made doubly so since I was traveling by myself. The routines that accompany repetition no longer feel so familiar. The scenery, while not unwelcoming, is not what you expected. So you sit up a little straighter, turn the radio down and realize that it’s time to find an exit. If you don’t have a GPS, you can never be sure that the next exit will take you where you need to go. But that’s fine. As long as you get back to heading in the right direction, you’ll end up where you need to be.
	Analogies are a handy abstraction used to explain an experience to someone who, in their right mind, would never attempt to duplicate it. I figured it would be best to start with one when trying to summarize my time at The Hatchet. That way, even if you read no further than this paragraph, you can leave with some understanding of what it feels like to be finished with working at The Hatchet.
	So what’s being on The Hatchet’s web team like? In some ways, it’s a pretty lonely existence. The office is always full of journalists, photographers and folks who work with paper-based content. There’s only ever one programmer. It’s a life spent being the black sheep.
	That’s not to say that you go unappreciated. College journalists have a tough time comprehending anything technical, so when you can program even the simplest application, there are accolades galore. But that is both a blessing and a curse. When everything is amazing, nothing is.
There are some unbelievably talented journalists working at The Hatchet. They have the skills and talent to recognize work that goes above and beyond and work that doesn’t. But that’s not the case as a developer. Make an elegant function, craft some beautiful code, spends hours solving the hairiest bug, add someone’s name to the email listserv, toggle a settings option in WordPress. To journalists at The Hatchet, it’s all the same. The work you do cannot be appreciated by anyone but the next member of the web team. To work knowing that no one you work with will ever understand the quality of your work is a tough pill to swallow.
That being said, getting to work for The Hatchet is an experience I would not trade for the world. It is a drive I would relive in a heartbeat. The routines no longer feel familiar. The scenery has changed. It looks like it’s time to sit up a bit straighter, turn down the radio and look for an exit. But I leave having acquired a depth and wealth of knowledge I could never get from sitting in class. I have had the opportunity to make friends with people who are the most capable in their field. It’s a shame, because it’s almost all downhill for here.
Before I make my exit, there are people who have made a profound influence on my life in need of thanks:
***
Priya: There are are people in this world who have serious caffeine addiction problems. You put those people to shame. One day, I hope you’ll have a classic rock playlist that consists of more than Hall and Oates on repeat. You have an infectiously positive attitude about all things journalism (which you should probably get checked out). You were the first editor in chief I’ve worked under who made The Hatchet into something worth the time and effort. I didn’t start to enjoy attending GW until my senior year. I guess it’s the simple things that always have the most profound influence. Late night cookies and coffee. Happy hour at the Bier Baron. Killing time in the office. I will be unbelievably disappointed if I don’t get the opportunity to work with you again. But I guess I don’t have to worry. You’ve got the right stuff, kid. I’ll be seeing you around.
Nacin: There are times when I wish that I was a little bit older so we could have worked together on The Hatchet’s web team. There are times when you annoy the crap out of me. Most of the time it’s a little from column a, a little from column b. You were definitely one of the major reasons I decided to pursue a computer science degree. You were not one of the major reasons behind my decision to graduate. I hope to always stay in touch.
Guiffré: I didn’t know much about Okinawa or big wave surfing in my freshmen year. I’m graduating and I still know almost next to nothing about either one. Thanks for taking the time to make someone feel like part of the gang.
Rachel: I’ll never forget that my time at The Hatchet started with production. Thanks for giving me a shot. Your ability to find cute cat videos was always impressive.
Gabe: I hope the retirement goes well. I’m not quite sure why you spent so much time sleeping on the office couch. It was a source of constant amusement.
Amanda: The stream of consciousness that emanated from you and the copy section was impressive in its political incorrectness. Dizzying heights of disturbing were reached on the daily. I’m still working on my Tetris skillz. Be prepared for some serious ass-kicking.
Ryan: Good luck with the English degree. I’m sure the scuzzy bar that hires you will be proud to know they’re employing a Phi Beta Kappa.
Devereaux: Thanks for having my back. You’ve always been the cornerstone of the web team. I don’t think I could have made it night after night without having somebody there to keep me grounded. You dealt with a ton of crap that would have made a person of weaker convictions throw in the towel. I’m constantly amazed that you didn’t decide early on to jump ship. I think that will always impress me the most. You have had a devotion to this institution that I envy. You’ve dealt with a ton of crap over the years, and you’ve dealt with it with extraordinary tact and grace. When the going gets tough, when it would be so much easier to just throw in the towel and call it a day, I always pull up the “Harry, I’ve reached the top” bit, burst out laughing and carry on with what needs to be done. I will never be able to thank you enough for sticking with it all these years. Remember, this doesn’t mean I won’t hunt you down and kick your ass if I see that clip from “Taken” just one more time.
Allison: There’s a an enjoyment to be derived from the consistency of the music played downstairs. No matter the hour of the day or the mood in the office, if a song is being played it will be from a Summer Hits of the 90’s or Billboard top 100 playlist. Please remember to laugh at the next web peron’s jokes. Sometimes they just need to be humored.
Traynor: As my figure might suggest, sports is not my forte. I do, however, have an immeasurable amount of respect for the work you have accomplished while at The Hatchet. Louis may have had an appreciation for the finer things in life, like classic rock and segway models, but the sheer amount of skill and talent you have as a reporter is unmatched by any sports reporter I’ve known while on staff. Let me state for the record that I do think if you root for the Bruins you’re a chump.
Jordan: Les Mis is an excellent musical. I might consider cutting a duet album with you in the future. Stay tuned. Good luck with the public health degree. Try not to let too much ebola escape into the wild.
Ferris: I have an immense amount of respect for the work you and Cory are going to accomplish. You guys are on the ball. I expect to see the volume 110 staff to produce significant quantities of quality work. Try not to puppeteer the web team too much. The next time I’m in Connecticut, I’d like to try my hand at milking a cow. Please arrange that.
Cory: Good luck with The Hatchet Tumblr!
To my family, I don’t think I was ever entirely truthful about what I did or how much time I spent on the paper. Thanks for not asking too many questions, and I love you all.
To my girlfriend, Martha, I always think you consider me to be a bit insane for sticking with The Hatchet for so long. I can’t thank you enough for, if not quite understanding, at least accepting the fact that I might be a bit insane for enjoying the late hours and terrible schedule. I love you, and I cannot thank you enough for always being there for me.
As the Dude says, it’s all “strikes and gutters, ups and downs.” For the last four years, and especially this past year, I’ve been lucky enough to end up throwing a lot of strikes. I can only hope that as I make my way towards my next destination, my luck will continue to hold. I don’t if I’m moving on to bigger or better things. I just know that I’m moving on, and hopefully I’m once again headed in the right direction. -30-

Applications to law school are plummeting around the country, and the GW Law School is holding off on releasing the number of students who applied this year. That nationwide downturn is giving students an edge, allowing them to negotiate financial aid packages.
The GW Law School is negotiating financial aid with accepted students, a new tactic used in several top law schools to improve yield rate as applications free fall by about 17 percent nationwide.
Competition among top law schools has grown fiercer to fill first-year classes, giving students more power to leverage for bigger aid packages. Some students said they have had more luck bargaining at GW than other universities.
The shaky climate for legal education is also keeping the GW Law School, ranked No. 21 by U.S. News & World Report, from disclosing its own application figures until the fall because that information could “impact our incoming class,” law school spokeswoman Liz Field said in an email. She added that this year’s application decline was “much less” than the 17 percent national slump, but would not elaborate.
Last year, GW disclosed its application numbers in April, and was about on par with the national decline. Field said disclosing last year’s data was an outlier, as “historically, the law school has never released preliminary data regarding applications.” The official deadline for first-year J.D. students to submit their applications was in March.
To turn those falling applications into a large enough first-year class, the school has turned to negotiating with students for aid. Field said the law school’s experience negotiating for tuition discounts “is comparable to other schools.” More than half of GW law students receive direct financial aid, the vast majority of which stems from the school’s $80 million operating budget.
Senior Ella Gladman picked GW Law School after applying to a dozen others over the past year, but her decision hinged on negotiation.
“When I would go to the admitted student days, pretty much everyone talks about how much money they got and if they’re going to ask for more and if they’re going to negotiate,” Gladman, who plans to study international or public interest law, said.
For Gladman, the back-and forth began after GW offered her $10,000 a year, which was less than what she got from some others. But after she asked for more financial aid from the school – leveraging the higher offers from other schools – GW hiked up its offer to $17,000, while others, like University of Southern California Gould School of Law, held their ground.
Across the country, law applicants now have “a bargaining chip,” said Kyle McEntee, executive director of national advocacy group Law School Transparency. He said the phenomenon is new, picking up particularly over the past year as headlines blared word of law schools’ struggles.
“The prospective students are empowered by the news coverage of the dropping applications and the expected dropping enrollment,” McEntee said. “The school needs them for the revenue.”
The prospects look bad from about every angle. Nationally, the average debt load for law graduates nationwide has surpassed $100,000, and just more than half earned full-time legal jobs after graduation last year.
Even at GW, where 81 percent of new graduates were employed last year, the school handed out $3 million to fund short-term internships for more than 100 former students.
McEntee said those numbers could be used by applicants as negotiating power, though schools shouldn’t “claim some moral high ground” by not disclosing data.
“Students would like to know whether they’re in a position to negotiate more for a larger tuition discount,” he said. “If they know that school is struggling to fill their class, and they are comfortable with the school, they’ll try to get as much money out of them as possible.”
Brian Tamanaha, a legal profession expert and a law professor at the Washington University in St. Louis Law School, said there’s not much law schools can do about students comparing enrollment and financial aid information,  especially on forums and info hubs like LawSchoolNumbers.com.
“Every law school is subject to what their competitors do. If a higher-up school is struggling with its enrollment target and it fills its waitlist early in the summer, it’ll be taking away students that even already paid their deposits elsewhere,” Tamanaha said. “It’s very volatile.”

Former Ambassador to Kuwait Edward Gnehm has strengthened the University's ties to the small Middle Eastern country. He currently serves as the director of GW's Middle East Policy Forum.
A $4 million gift from the Kuwaiti government last week brought the total amount donated by the Middle Eastern country to the University to nearly $13 million – strong support from a small country as GW looks to globalize.
The Elliott School of International Affairs has forged a strong relationship with Kuwait through former Ambassador Edward Gnehm, whose position as a professor for Gulf and Arabian Peninsula affairs is endowed by its government.  Gnehm, an alumnus and former student government leader, served as ambassador to Kuwait in the early 1990s when Iraq occupied the country.
“In the Middle East, relationships are always very personal. Friendships mean a lot,” Gnehm said. “What you do with and for people mean a lot. The fact that I was ambassador to Kuwait during the time they were in exile, it was sort of a high-profile part of the liberation, and it was something they never forgot.”
The most recent donation in a series of gifts will continue to provide funding for the the Institute for Middle East Studies, as well as aid graduate students. Donations have also supported Gelman Library’s Middle East and North Africa Research Center, created new classes, strengthened existing programs and brought speakers to campus.
Marc Lynch, director of the Institute for Middle East Studies, said the endowments from the Kuwaiti government had helped the institute develop Arabic programs and hold a range of programming events.
“[Gnehm] understands the importance of educating young people to better understand the Middle East region and has supported us in this endeavor,” Lynch said in an email.
The University received a $4.5 million endowment from Kuwait in 2011, which created the Middle East and North Africa Research Center. It also received $1 million in 2008 and $3.4 million in 2005.
Kuwait lies between Iraq and Saudi Arabia and has a population of 2.6 million people. Twelve students from the country are enrolled at GW.
Current ambassador of Kuwait Salem Al-Sabah presented the gift to Gnehm and University President Steven Knapp in D.C. earlier this month, and they discussed how to increase opportunities for students and faculty members in both countries.
The Elliott School also receives an endowment from the Korea Foundation of the Republic of Korea, although Lynch said the relationship with Kuwait was unique for the Institute of Middle East Studies.
Gnehm said Kuwaiti government leaders had been eager to support the institute over the years, often asking how they can support the program.
“I often go back. I’ve spoken there, I’ve hosted them here. It’s a fairly normal relationship between friends, really,” he said. “It gives us a stability and we aren’t really drawing that from student tuition or others. We have this gift which will enable us to support our middle east program, so it’s very nice.”

Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa worked with officials to remove red tape and spur more faculty to hire research assistants.  The provost's office will run the hiring process this fall, instead of University Human Resources.   
The University is trying to increase research opportunities for graduate students by making it easier for professors to appoint them as project assistants
The move comes as GW, en route to becoming an improved research university, tries to shed outdated practices. Professors will be able to appoint graduate students as research assistants more informally, removing much of the administrative process Provost Steven Lerman said may have discouraged faculty from working with students in the past.
With fewer hiring hurdles, Lerman said GW would be “back in the mainstream,” which he added is crucial as GW strives to become a major research institution.
Currently, faculty members heading a research project must create positions for assistants through University Human Resources, categorizing students as University employees rather than students.
The process irked professors, with their frustration coming to a head at a Faculty Senate meeting earlier this month when economics professor Anthony Yezer threatened to pen a “nasty” resolution if administrators did not change the system. Lerman said then that he had just completed finalizing the changes that would alleviate their frustrations.
Starting in the fall, appointments will be approved by the Office of the Provost instead of human resources, and the graduate students’ employment will be contingent on their remaining a student.
The change could help as GW increases research efforts and pours money into science and engineering through a new $275 million building that will increase the number of research labs on campus.
Last year, the University inched into the top 100 research institutions in the National Science Foundation’s ranking. It has still, however, had to reverse processes that have held its research back – for instance, researchers have been pushing for GW to adopt updated software that tracks research grants year by year.
Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa said the current system for appointing research assistants – which he called “archaic” – was the result of years spent without a close eye on research.
“Because we haven’t been a major research force, there are a number of things like that just sort of slipped through the crack, and that needed to be fixed,” Chalupa said.
Lerman said it was difficult to tally the number of graduate students conducting research with faculty because most are paid by outside organizations, like the National Institutes of Health.
Creating positions for specific students will also help professors nab grants, Yezer said. Organizations such as the NSF, a major source of research funding for GW, place weight on grant applications that name the research assistants because they are more complete applications, he said.
Yezer said the change to consider research assistants as students instead of employees also was necessary because they are hired for a specific period of time, while University employees are expected to work for longer periods.
“We’re treating these people as if they’re just regular employees, and therefore they have the same benefits structure as people who would come here with the expectation they’re going to work here for 20 years. And again, that’s not just appropriate,” Yezer said.

Metropolitan Police Department officers arrested a student last week for possession of cocaine, marijuana and drug paraphernalia and intent to distribute marijuana.
Violations for hard drugs – such as cocaine, ecstasy and hallucinogens – have skyrocketed by about 50 percent this year compared to the last, according to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The arrest last week marks the 29th case involving hard drugs this year.
A University Police officer was performing a routine patrol in Mitchell Hall on April 22 when he smelled a “strong odor of burnt marijuana in the hallway” coming from the student’s room, according to MPD documents. The officer found him inside the room smoking a “green, weed-like substance.”
House staff then conducted an administrative search and found a plastic tub and Ziploc bag containing weed, a Ragu jar covered in residue and a gray pill filled with cocaine.
Administrators also found drug paraphernalia in the 21-year-old’s room, including grinders, a digital scale and an electronic smoking device. The report did not name the student.
As of April 22, 13 students have been charged with intent to distribute drugs this academic year. In the last two years, 11 and 12 students, respectively, received intent to distribute charges.

The University has a habit of keeping information under lock and key, routinely declining to reveal budget breakdowns, crime and campus safety details and even documents that were once on the public record.
Of the last 22 issues, an alarming 19 opinions pages included a “What the University Won’t Talk About” feature, highlighting cases in which GW declined to comment – all in an effort to push back against the culture of secrecy that has marked University President Steven Knapp’s administration.
Each night before going to press, the opinions editors and editor in chief look through correspondences between reporters and administrators or staffers to determine what questions were left unanswered that issue. The unknown details range from crucial to simply bizarre.
GW has declined to discuss security changes, the number of pets found in residence halls, the number of FixIt requests and the names of the six dean candidate finalists – just to name a few since January.
A decline to comment isn’t a sign that the information requested does not exist, or that administrators do not know the answer. It means that information is being actively withheld from the public.
And this culture of secrecy is intolerable.
Muzzling information only leaves students to draw their own conclusions and assume the worst, which can have a negative effect on the University – especially at a time when GW has actively looked to polish its name through a rebranding and advertising campaign.
The University set a negative tone even as it tried to push its new brand by refusing to disclose the cost of the rebranding work, which was performed by outside firms. The secrecy prodded students to wonder just how much GW spent to buff up its image, instead of embracing its message.
The most blatant example of this lack of transparency came at the University’s most vulnerable moment.
Even after administrators came forward to disclose they had inflated admissions data for a decade, they still kept other information sealed. Officials claimed they did not document the audit of admissions data completed by an outside firm, prompting questions about whether or not the number manipulation was malicious. The University also kept its top admissions official out of the public eye, prohibiting her from answering questions about the mistakes her office made for at least 10 years.
And the information lockdown reached a new level when earlier this semester, the University refused to release its 990 tax forms from the last decade – records that were once public. A spokeswoman said the University is only required to make three years of those records public. Accordingly, University leaders have decided to release only what is required by law, and absolutely no more, even if this data might be instrumental in improving campus life.
If the University commits itself to disclosing the bare minimum amount of information, it will quickly lose the public’s trust.
GW relies on flocks of people buying into its future. The University needs applicants, students, donors, alumni, faculty and employees to believe it is on the right track with its academics, research, campus safety and financial decisions.  Without this trust in place, the University cannot continue to move forward.
By keeping the record books closed, the University might believe it shields itself from scrutiny. But this is misguided, and will only invite frustration and more questions. A policy of secrecy alienates people the University needs to help it grow.
The “What the University Won’t Talk About” box will remain on the top of the opinions page. And it will continue to have a place until this culture of covertness subsides. If that openness happens soon, GW can make a leap toward becoming an institution we trust.

Faculty are contemplating a policy shift that would remove the unwanted “incomplete” mark from transcripts of students who do not complete a course.
For years, students have lamented the University’s policy on incomplete courses, which applies when students withdraw from courses for any reason – including due to medical concerns. Students often have to clarify the mark on their transcripts to employers or graduate school admissions officers because it comes with no explanation.
The Faculty Senate’s educational policy committee will consider the change this fall, which would bring the University in line with some its peer schools, including Boston University.
Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman, who called for the review, said he has questioned the idea of incompletes on transcripts, and has also had conversations with associate deans scrutinizing the policy.
“One of the things I always want to do is make sure we’re doing what helps our students out the most as they go forward and present their transcripts and stuff to employers, other grad schools,” he said. “On the other hand, I think we also want these transcripts to accurately reflect the record.”
Sophomore Megan Shah, who finished several courses at home in California last year for medical reasons, said the incomplete on her transcript is often interpreted negatively. Shah’s transcript shows the grades she received in her classes, but an ‘I’ is in front of them.
“It does make me nervous,” Shah, an international affairs major, said. “I’ve already had to explain this to employers. Because this was due to a serious medical issue, I thought my grades would be recorded like any other semester.”
Provost Steven Lerman said the policy change is best left up to faculty to decide.
“There are students who get incompletes because of illnesses or other things. It’s not clear that employers understand that nuance,” Lerman said. “On the other hand, there are cases that students get incompletes because they just didn’t get the work done, and one could argue that is at least useful information to a potential employer.”
New York University students who are unable to complete a course for a good reason receive incompletes until they make up the work. Boston University gives students up to a year to complete coursework if they have a valid reason to not complete the class on time.

As new details emerge about the identities and motives of the Boston Marathon bombers, the Muslim-American community will be under greater scrutiny than it has been at any period since the 9/11 attacks.
And as an American-born Muslim, I treasure the spirit of tolerance that allows me to cultivate my passion for my faith and pride for my country’s rich history and culture. I have no doubt that it will continue even if Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect of the Boston bombing, attributes the cause of his violence to political Islamic ideology.
As the hunt for the Tsarnaev brothers began, Muslims throughout the United States not only prayed for the victims of the bombings like the rest of the country, but they also hoped that the suspects would not turn out to belong to their faith community.
The situation leaves Muslims in this country enduring backlash from a justifiably angry American public. But that backlash – aimed at a group of people who did nothing wrong – is unwarranted.
The Muslim-American community cannot be subjected to generalizations. It is multi-ethnic and socioeconomically diverse. This diversity is clearly evident on the streets of this campus, where Muslims come from various locations within the U.S. and around the world. You may see them eating at the halal food trucks outside the library, or at Bobby’s Burger Palace. They may wear hijabs – traditional Islamic headscarves that demonstrate modesty – or shorts, because the weather is getting warmer. Some may offer weekly prayers in Miriam’s Kitchen on Friday afternoon, and others may sleep in after partying the night before.
Whether they wear Islam on their sleeve or keep it within their heart, the fact is that all Muslims at GW benefit from the spirit of openness on campus.
How long will it take until the menace of extremism stops spreading chaos? How long until the media’s portrayal of Islam focuses on something other than violence, intolerance and cultural decay? The majority of the Muslims in this country hope the answer to these questions is “soon.”
But in the meantime, I ask Muslims who feel offended by negative narratives about Islam to think about how blessed we still are to be part of a country that derives its strength from its tolerance and inclusiveness. I also ask non-Muslims who are fed up with radical elements of the religion to recognize that radicalism itself is not an epidemic in the Muslim community, but rather a manifestation of destructive ideas that have no place in the mainstream.
I identify with all Americans regardless of their religion or ethnicity, and I pray that as time passes, they gradually view the Muslim community with the same tolerance.
