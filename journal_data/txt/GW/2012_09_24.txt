Student lobbyists are demanding that the University pull back the health insurance policy it forced more than 3,000 students to pay for this summer.
International students and those in the medical, nursing and public health schools – who are required to have health insurance – must pay at least $2,200 for the University plan. Student Association leaders are demanding that the University allow students to use their own insurance policies.
This year’s policy, which expanded coverage, costs about 40 percent more than those from previous years, SA members Shirley Hsieh and Shashwat Gautam said. The University did not announce the mandated insurance plan through the health insurance provider Aetna until July, students said – after all students, even though who already had insurance, were charged.
The new plan, in line with the Affordable Care Act, is to cover full contraception and preventative coverage for problems like depression, alcoholism and drug addiction. It also covers medication costs up to $100,000 and provides a $2 million injury insurance.
Hsieh and Gautam submitted a 17-page report to student health administrators last week, calling on GW to give students a way out of the costly plan, saying it costs $400 a year more than plans at 21 other schools studied. They also requested a simpler appeals process, which is handled by the provider Aetna.
“Students are in a cycle because they cannot pre-decide or compare plans without buying them,” Gautam said.
They said dozens of students – particularly graduate students who must also pay for family members added to their plans – have tried to appeal the mandate.
“For me, it’s more important that there’s no alternatives – there’s no freedom of choice,” Hsieh, SA director of international students, said.
Mohibul Islam, a graduate student from Bangladesh, said the insurance company did not recognize his coverage through his father’s employer, the Embassy of Bangladesh. He filed an appeal Aug. 27 with Aetna but has not yet heard back.
“The waiver process is supposed to be for people who have a legitimate level of coverage. I have that, but I’m being denied a waiver. There is no clear way to engage Aetna on this issue – I’ve reached out to them, and they’ve just ignored me,” he said.
Student Health Service administrator Tracy Boswell said the University will consider the students’ proposal and respond in the next two weeks. But Gautam said he is concerned by what he has heard from administrators.
“What we found was there was no involvement of the student body, and it seemed like a completely arbitrary decision done by Student Health Service without taking surveys of the student body,” Gautam said.

More than a handful of Metropolitan Police officers arrested a former student Thursday at The Avenue for intent to sell narcotics and possession of a semi-automatic rifle and ammunition.
In a raid of a fifth-floor apartment, officers took the 25-year-old – unnamed in police documents – into custody after discovering the unregistered gun, ammunition, amphetamine and heroin.
The suspect was previously enrolled at GW, University Police Chief Kevin Hay said.
University spokeswoman Candace Smith declined to provide the time frame of his enrollment, his name or whether or not he graduated by publication time.
With a search warrant from D.C. Superior Court, at least six members of the Narcotics Special Investigations Division, entered the apartment Thursday evening at 6:08 p.m. They were armed with machine guns as they stormed the building.
They found a “plastic freezer bag containing brown powder,” which tested positive for heroin, and an unspecified amount of pills, according to the documents.
Officers exited the apartment complex at about 7:25 p.m. with the handcuffed 6-foot-2-inch suspect.

Clarification appended
The University Police Department is increasing campus patrols this fall to clamp down on underage drinking.
Officers will monitor parties on and off campus where they suspect students are drinking, and UPD Chief Kevin Hay told the Interfraternity Council last week that fraternities should expect a larger police presence at their events, several members said.
Hay said officers will crack down on enforcement, but he declined to comment on why he met with Greek chapter heads. He also declined to provide the number of this year’s on- and off-campus housing patrols compared to past years, but he has said in the past that 18 officers patrol the Foggy Bottom Campus at all times.
Some Greek chapter presidents said they feel targeted in the aftermath of two sexual abuse reports at Townhouse Row – Greek housing – earlier this month.
There are 14 Greek townhouses on campus, with additional chapter housing located at Strong Hall and International House. The University also considers groups of fraternity members who live together in off-campus apartments to be part of chapter-affiliated housing.
Colton Blackman, president of Pi Kappa Phi, said chapter heads were told the crackdown was a direct response to the sexual abuse allegations in Townhouse Row, along with two other reported incidents near campus, so far this year. All four reported abuses involved alcohol.
He said he agreed with GW’s focus on safety, but added that he would feel targeted as a member of the Greek community if that were the only student organization approached by UPD.
Colin O’Brien, president of Beta Theta Pi, called the additional patrolling “unprecedented” and said he felt that the Greek community was being singled out unfairly. He said chapters must create more sexual assault prevention programming to erase a stigma surrounding the Greek community and sexual abuse.
O’Brien said his chapter cancelled a handful of events last weekend to play it safe the weekend before rush begins. Five other chapters said they also kept a closer eye on their parties this weekend and alerted members of the additional patrolling.
One chapter head, who wished to remain anonymous, said his chapter sometimes holds parties that are not registered with the University’s Center for Alcohol and Drug Education, because they are not planned in advance. He said he is concerned that officers will shut down such parties and force their chapter into probation for breaking the University’s policy of registering every party that serves alcohol with CADE.
Jared Benoff, president of Alpha Epsilon Pi, said he was “encouraged” that the University was taking steps to make campus safer, but said he hoped the alleged sexual assaults would not spur the University to stifle the Greek community.
Daniel Gil, president of the Interfraternity Council, and presidents from 10 fraternities – including Phi Kappa Psi, where two of the reported sexual assaults this semester took place – did not return request for comment.
Greek Life director Christina Witkowicki did not return requests for comment.

Administrators rejected the two largest Student Association strategies to expand student space on campus last week.
After two years of lobbying and rhetoric, SA executives submitted a 22-page proposal laying out 10 ways administrators could open up space on campus for students. The University fully agreed to just one proposal, calling the plan’s centerpieces – opening up academic buildings for 24 hours and scrapping all fees for student organization events – impractical.
Provost Steven Lerman and Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz agreed through a formal letter to open up seven conference rooms in the Marvin Center for student use after business hours.
The University also agreed to extend Funger and Duques halls’ hours by four hours, to 2 a.m., starting Oct. 1.
GW will also begin splitting room reservation and technology fees with the SA to lift the burden off individual student groups.
Administrators cited security, housekeeping and energy concerns while dismissing SA President Ashwin Narla and Executive Vice President Abby Bergren’s call for 24-hour academic buildings. They also rejected the SA’s call for dining halls to open on weekends and for GW to renovate the Marvin Center third floor’s terrace into an indoor space.

“The short-term recommendations were all met, but a lot of the future recommendations are to be decided. We’re going to have those conversations,” Narla said.
The senior, whose campaign platform last spring largely emphasized increasing student space on campus, said he is not discouraged that the University did not commit to the plan’s long-term goals.
“It’s a step in the right direction,” Narla said. “But we’re going to continue the conversation, continue the work. This is great, but we still have some ways to go in the conversations.”
Under Lerman’s and Katz’s plan, the SA, instead of individual organizations, would shoulder an $8,000 annual fee, allowing groups to rent rooms and equipment for the entire year. Narla said he hopes to lower the cost to $4,000 so the SA can keep more money for allocations to student groups.
Narla and Bergren said they will keep pushing the University to share more of the costs related to room rentals, like the $80 microphone and $120 DVD player fees.
The administrators’ letter also outlined how they would use the vacant office spaces across campus that Narla identified as potential student hubs.
The International Services Office will leave its K Street office next month and move into Old Main, left empty after the GW Career Center moved over the summer. The old study abroad office, known as the Parsonage Building, located at 812 20th St., will undergo repairs.
Narla said he and Bergren want the 20,000-square-foot former study abroad office to go to students.
“They’re not going to necessarily include us in that conversation unless we really push for that,” Narla said, adding that he would like to advocate for the building to take on the Office of Veterans Services or become another hang-out space for multicultural students.
Bergren said the administration’s formal acknowledgement of the plan was a key achievement for the SA.
“It’s one of the more recent in our history where we brought up a student driven idea that wasn’t piggybacking onto a previous University initiative and seeing it though,” Bergren said. “It’s a great win for us and for students.”

Student Health Service has seen a 40 percent increase in psychiatric appointments, which students say has created a month-long wait before they can get help.
The wait for psychiatric appointments ranges from three to four weeks, Senior Associate Dean of Students Mark Levine said, adding that “the wait time has fluctuated based on student needs and staffing.”
Students must sit through appointments to be prescribed medication and some said they have been told to wait up to six weeks.
The office has seen 160 appointments so far this year – up from 115 last year – between its two part-time psychiatrists. But Levine said about 60 of this year’s appointments have been “no shows,” despite phone confirmations – creating delays that keep other students from getting into the office faster. He also said one of the two psychiatrists was out “for a short while,” prolonging the wait.
Levine, who is also the interim director of the University Counseling Center, said the waitlist for counseling visits is about a week, on par with past years. But several students said it takes longer.
Senior Amanda Andreski said she walked into the counseling center the first week of classes, looking to see a counselor that day. The receptionist told her the next available appointment was in about two weeks and recommended she seek private counseling.
“I left there pretty disappointed, because if a student comes to you and says, ‘I need to talk to someone,’ they shouldn’t be pushed away. I think that’s really dangerous,” she said.
Andreski will have her first appointment Monday. She left campus for one week in early September, but has called into the center for three weeks to check if appointments opened up.
Levine said referrals are “not typically” recommended as an alternative to meeting with a UCC clinician, but it is “not uncommon” for a student to be referred for outside counseling if an initial assessment shows they need long-term help. GW’s counseling center, like those at other universities, is designed for short-term help.
Two counseling offices in the area have seen slight increases in student visitors.
Selina Gross, office manager of the Psychological Group of Washington, said about five more students have requested appointments this year.
Psychiatrist Gerald Perman said he has also seen a handful more GW students come into the center saying they were “unable to conveniently get an appointment with the University’s center.” At his office, students can be seen within days, he said.
One student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he was never contacted after his initial phone assessment late this summer. He said the counselor who initially reached out to him did not return his calls for weeks.
“I just assumed somebody would call me back. No one ever answered me,” he said.
He finally got an appointment about a month after his first call, after speaking to a case worker at the center.
Levine said he had not heard of students waiting a month for appointments in the past, and added that it was “certainly not something that has happened often.”
The University Counseling Center has seen a slight drop in visitors since the academic year began, with about 450 appointments so far this year academic year. Levine said that figure is slightly lower compared to this time last year.
But in the last two months, UCC staff held nearly 50 information sessions encouraging students to take advantage of the six free appointments the center offers.
The outreach, which started at Colonial Inauguration and ramped up as classes began, is part of GW’s growing focus on mental health services over the last year. The University scrapped fees for individual counseling sessions last fall, leading to a 25 percent spike in new clients.
“Our numbers indicate that students continue to see UCC as a primary resource for care and support during challenging times in their lives and with additional staff on board we are able to provide even more direct service to our students,” Levine said.
The center has also seen an increase in walk-in appointments and first-time visitors compared to this time last year.
The University said in August that it was hiring four full-time staff psychologists and three other staff members this fall. The counseling center’s website lists four full-time counselors.
The center added an assistant director of outreach and programming this year. It has brought on a new full-time director, but Levine said the University is not ready to announce the hire that will replace former director John Dages.
Dages and former associate director Barbara Brown resigned last year, after several UCC employees claimed their poor leadership was driving staffers away from the center.

The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences is planning a law and society minor that would create GW’s first undergraduate academic program tailored to legal studies.
The 18-credit minor would launch next fall and mostly include existing courses in political science, economics, sociology and history – a step to strengthen legal education at a University which has a top law school but no specific pre-law degree for undergraduates.
Michael Gabriel, a pre-law adviser in the Columbian College, is spearheading the effort, which will introduce undergraduates to legal writing and strategies in areas like constitutional law and criminal justice before they decide on attending law school.
He said it would not be designed as a specific pre-law program, because law schools prefer a broad liberal arts education.
“It can show them what to expect and to see what lawyers do for a living. Or students can say this is really interesting, but I don’t want to [become a lawyer]. An informed, intelligent decision is great either way,” he said.
Gabriel will present a case for the minor at the school’s Oct. 11 meeting of the undergraduate studies committee, a body that would ultimately give it the green light. He said it could potentially be housed in the sociology department, which trains students on social justice theory.
Columbian College’s associate dean for undergraduate studies Dan Ullman said while he’s not “out there stumping for new majors and minors,” a law and society program would make sense in enhancing students’ critical thinking skills.
Michael Fazio – vice president of the Pre-Law Student Association, a group of about 100 undergraduates who write legal briefs and preps for the LSAT – said the program would fit the legal field’s interdisciplinary focus.
“I think that it would be a good addition for students on the pre-law track.  It’s a good way for students to get a good idea of what the legal field is about,” Fazio, a junior, said.
Jill Kasle, an associate professor of public policy and public administration, said the program would appeal to undergraduates’ legal ambitions. About 28 percent of GW graduates pursue further study in law, according to U.S. News & World Report.
“So many kids come to GW wanting to make a career in law, so anything that introduces study in this subject is beneficial to their education,” she said.
Neighboring American University has maintained its own law and society department for more than two decades, offering both a major and a minor in the field for undergraduates. Schools like Florida State and Cornell universities also have similar minors.

The University has steadily built up its core of full-time professors over the last four years, but administrators now have a new challenge: keeping them.
Provost Steven Lerman said the University must fortify against professor “poaching” by more elite schools by being more proactive and working with deans and department heads to keep star professors at GW.
“We have to make sure we do not become the farm team as we attract these great scholars, so we don’t want to become the place you come to leave,” Lerman said. “We have to make this a supportive, challenging environment in which they find the resources to pursue their own interests.”
The University added 96 professors this year, continuing its 10 percent growth in full-time faculty positions, even at a time when other universities held back on hiring after the 2008 financial crisis.
University spokeswoman Jill Sankey declined to provide the number of total faculty hired away by other universities.
Economics professor Donald Parsons, who said he has seen three “highly productive young scholars” hired away in the last seven or eight years, blames low-paying promotion packages.
“We are, in some, respects missing a generation,” Parsons said. “If we underpay these young faculty members and they feel compelled to explore outside offers, they often end up taking those offers.”
Among the 14 universities GW considers its peer schools, like Northwestern and Boston universities, the University falls roughly in the middle of the pack for average salaries of associate professors.
New hires – which administrators and department heads herald as some of the best GW has added in areas like engineering, economics and political science – could soon become the “envy” of higher-ranked schools, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said.
Maltzman added that while schools and departments mostly make tenure and promotion decisions, the provost’s office has made retaining top faculty a priority this year.
“By working with the deans to ensure that faculty raises are allocated based upon merit and when necessary putting together retention packages, the provost helps to retain star faculty,” he said.
New hires and tenured professors mostly praised the University’s work adding research dollars and focusing on retention issues.
Associate professor of political science John Sides, who earned tenure two years ago, said three professors have left the department for other schools like Columbia and Georgetown universities in the last few years. He added that some opt for other universities to be closer to family or because they earn administrative positions.
Professors and Lerman listed a range of factors that help promote faculty retention, from obvious indicators, like salaries, research funding and lab space, to less measurable qualities, like encouraging a collegial atmosphere.
The University has tried to support new professors with start-up packages to help them begin their research. The amount of money GW allocates for research ballooned between fiscal years 2008 and 2010, increasing threefold to $34.4 million.
Administrators are also counting on the high-tech laboratories in the eight-story Science and Engineering Hall, which will open its doors in 2015, to help attract and keep top professors.
David Dolling, dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, said only two faculty members had left the school in the last five years – a testament, he said, to its strong faculty mentorship program that he wants to strengthen this year. The school hired 35 new faculty during that period.
Some recent steps that improve professors’ happiness in their jobs have also helped retention, professors said. The University tripled the amount of paid leave for new parents in 2008, a factor that professor of counseling Sylvia Marotta and professor of decision sciences and psychology Philip Wirtz called important.
Michael Barnett, a University professor of political science and international affairs, warned that an improving economy means that universities looking to hire will get aggressive. Barnett himself, a top international affairs scholar, was hired away by GW from University of Wisconsin-Madison two years ago.
“What’s happening now is that [universities] were starved for a while and now are getting money to rehire. So universities are poaching and moving more aggressively,” Barnett said. “It’s always a problem, and in some places, I suspect it’ll get more intense.”

In a neighborhood bustling with college students, there is one group of people who are sometimes overlooked: the elderly.
A group of Foggy Bottom residents is looking to launch a support network for the elderly who wish to remain in their homes as they age and have reached out to the University for help arranging volunteers.
In theory, students could be paired with neighbors to help cook meals to take individuals to doctor visits.
But University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard told The Hatchet last week that while GW remains “open to negotiations” with program leaders, there are no plans to form ties with the program.
At a university in which community service is an integral component of campus culture, GW should not hesitate to establish a new partnership that would demonstrate a strong commitment to the larger Foggy Bottom community. Finding 200 students to join the program would likely not be an arduous task.
GW has increased its size and presence in Foggy Bottom over the last decade and has since worked to mitigate the bitter relationships that expansion produced. In striving to maintain the more positive relationship that has existed in recent years, this partnership would give back to individuals who have felt their community has been lost to a mammoth university.
This would be another way that students and administrators could get involved in the local community, in addition to the larger scale efforts like alternative breaks. There is tremendous value in making a difference down the block from campus.
It would be a missed opportunity for the University to not forge a partnership with the Aging in Place program.
