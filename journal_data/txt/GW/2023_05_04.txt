Metropolitan Police Department officers survey 23rd Street following an alleged armed carjacking Thursday.
Updated: Friday, May 5, 2023, at 6:18 p.m.
Metropolitan Police Department officers arrested two teenagers accused of committing an armed carjacking at on campus Thursday, according to an MPD spokesperson.
MPD spokesperson Alaina Gertz said Thursday that the department received a call at 1:32 p.m. for an armed carjacking, where multiple suspects reportedly stole a victim’s white Honda Accord, and that the victim reported no injuries. A different MPD spokesperson said Friday that officers arrested a 14-year-old male and a 16-year-old female at about 6:50 p.m. Thursday and recovered the vehicle.
The alleged carjacking occurred on the 2300 Block of 23rd Street, near the Mount Vernon Express stop in front of Tompkins Hall. At least two MPD units and one GW Police Department unit responded to the scene Thursday.
The spokesperson confirmed Friday there were still no reported injuries. MPD spokesperson Hugh Carew said the teens were armed with a handgun in an email Friday.
University officials issued a GW Alert at 1:31 p.m. advising community members of an armed carjacking at 22nd and G streets, requesting community members “look out” for a white Honda Accord and call 911 with any information. The alert advised community members not to approach the vehicle.
The University issued an all-clear alert at 1:53 p.m. Thursday.

Students and dining employees marched from Kogan Plaza to the dining hall in the District House basement Monday.
Roughly two dozen students marched from Kogan Plaza to the District House dining hall to show support for food service employees demanding improved wages and respect from management Monday.
Students and dining employees walked to DC Taco House, a food vendor in the basement of District House, and delivered a letter to a GW Dining official by the taco restaurant that demanded better wages and treatment from management. Student leaders and dining workers said the protest demonstrated students’ solidarity in advocating for dining employees employed through Compass Group, the parent company of the University’s food service vendor Chartwells Higher Education. 
Tracie Thompson, an employee at a vendor in District House, said employees “can’t live” off the minimum wage they receive despite Compass Group’s valuation of more than $25 billion, according to the company’s annual report. Thompson said Compass management is not doing “their part of the work” and that demonstrators aimed to advocate for fair wages, free health insurance and respect through their march. 
“We’re at minimum wages and that’s not fair living for us to pay our bills,” Thompson said. “You can’t buy chicken or bread with your paycheck you bring home when your rent is 1,500 or 2,000.”
The University partnered with Chartwells Higher Education to provide campus dining services at all-you-can-eat dining halls in Shenkman and Thurston Hall and vendors in District House in 2021. UNITE HERE Local 23 – a branch of a labor union that represents hundreds of thousands of service workers – is currently in negotiations with Compass Group to demand at least a $20 minimum wage for dining workers employed through the company at institutions like the World Bank, American University and GW. 
A Compass Group job posting for a food service position at Shenkman currently offers employees a $16.80 starting wage, 70 cents more than the current D.C. minimum wage of $16.10. Full-time Compass Group employees are eligible for medical, dental and vision benefits, while both part-time and full-time workers can access “health and wellness programs,” according to the job posting.
A spokesperson for Chartwells Higher Education said Friday officials will continue to bargain in good faith during negotiations with UNITE HERE Local 23 to reach a new agreement that is “fair to all.” The spokesperson said the union postponed the timing for their next meeting, but officials are “glad” they will reconvene in “just over a week.”
The spokesperson declined to say what benefits Compass Group offers its food service employees.
“We’re eager to provide increases to our employees and give them clarity as soon as possible,” the spokesperson said in an email Friday.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian deferred comment to Chartwells Higher Education because dining staff are employed through the company.
Julian Abeledo, a junior studying civil engineering and one of the protest organizers, said the action was the first “big” show of student support for dining workers at GW compared to efforts at American and Catholic universities.
UNITE HERE Local 23 partnered with GW student organization Students Against Imperialism to host a teaching event April 20. The branch collaborated with American University’s Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter to host a similar event March 28 and Catholic University’s Progressive Student Union March 24. 
“It’s a lot more developed at AU and Catholic, where they’ve had this solidarity planning going on for many months now,” Abeledo said. “But I think this is an important step forward here at GW. It’s an important first step towards building more concrete solidarity in the future.”
Abeledo said he heard about the effort to improve workers’ treatment at the University through his involvement in local labor organizations and connections with union organizers.
“If I’m a student at this university, it’s my responsibility to support the workers who are here feeding the students every single day,” Abeledo said.
Abeledo said the protest sent a “good message to management” by showing student solidarity with the workers’ demands. He said the future of further solidarity protests depends on if the University meets the workers’ demands, and that holding demonstrations in the dining halls with megaphones, which was done at American, could be an option if demands are not met.
“We’re not gonna let them trample over the workers’ rights,” Abeledo said.
Jovanna Walker, the vice president of student organization Black Defiance, said she doesn’t believe the GW community is “receptive” to the idea of standing in solidarity with campus workers but that Black Defiance hopes to support future demonstrations for dining workers.
“Any other action they plan to have, we hope to be here, stand in solidarity, and give our resources, energy, time in any way possible,” Walker said.

Tigerella, the Italian-style restaurant in Western Market, closed its doors Monday after less than a year of operation. 
Tigerella, the Italian-style restaurant in Western Market Foodhall, closed its doors Monday after less than a year of operation.
A Tigerella Instagram post announcing the closure Monday states the lack of office workers returning to the area made the restaurant’s business model “unsustainable.” The post states Tigerella will “pass the torch” to another vendor that can find more success.
“THE TIGER IS ASLEEP,” the post reads. “We are very proud of what we did and we could not have done it without our incredible team, the heart and soul of Tigerella.”
Tigerella staff did not return multiple requests for comment.
The restaurant opened alongside a Tigerella cafe in Western Market last July. The cafe side of Tigerella closed in January due to competition from neighboring coffee shops and slow business, and bagel shop Bullfrog Bagels moved in to the cafe’s space.
“Thanks to all who came to Western Market to visit us and our neighbors,” the Instagram post states. “Please continue to support small businesses!”

Student Association Vice President Demetrius Apostolis swears in incoming SA senators during Monday's meeting.
Updated: Friday, May 5, 2023, at 7:46 p.m.
The Student Association Senate unanimously passed a resolution to create a special committee on dining reform in their first meeting of the term Monday.
The Dining Examination and Reform Act will create the Special Committee on Dining Reform, which will assess and address student’s concerns regarding health violations of the University’s dining halls. SA Sen. Dan Saleem, CCAS-U, who sponsored the bill, said he felt moved to create the new committee after seeing a “concerning” document from DC Health that showed “most” campus dining halls received a moderate to high contamination level.
A DC Health Food Establishment Inspection Report of The Eatery at Pelham Commons from March 8 states that officials observed mice droppings in dining hall’s dry storage area and opened food products that were not closed air-tight, increasing the risk of “possible contamination.” The report also flagged the dining hall’s improper use of dating and labeling, as well as improper temperature holdings of cold units and cold food items. A later report from March 20 showed dining officials corrected the violations.
Saleem said his friends who live on the Mount Vernon Campus and eat at Pelham complained to him about the dining hall conditions they observed. He said he was “afraid” his friends would not show up to class because they were in the hospital with food poisoning after eating in the dining halls.
Saleem said his proposal will address students’ concerns about the safety of dining hall food and give them the “justice” they deserve after his friends asked him what the SA was planning on doing to remedy the issue.
“This isn’t your run of the mill problems in the dining hall,” Saleem said. “This is mice droppings in the kitchen, open containers and storage fridges that don’t effectively prevent spoilage.”
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said officials have made all “necessary resolutions” after reviewing the violations and implementing a “corrective action plan” with leadership from Chartwells Higher Education, GW’s food service vendor. She said the University encourages students to provide feedback through GW Dining’s Student Advisory Panel.
“Dining leadership audits and inspects every dining hall daily to ensure GW students, staff and faculty have a safe and enjoyable dining experience,” Metjian said in an email Friday.
Senators elected SA Sen. Izzy Brophy, CCAS-U, the former dining service secretary, to serve as the chairperson of the special committee.
SA Vice President Demetrius Apostolis swore in incoming senators. Senators also elected Emma Hodgson, a freshman who tied with sophomore Elliot Morton for the ESIA-U senator seat during April SA elections, after conducting a private vote immediately following speeches from the two candidates on why they believe they should be elected during the meeting.
Hodgson said during her speech she will work to make GW safer for all students as a woman on campus, and extend Lerner Health and Wellness Center hours. Morton said he planned to create “fun” community events for students and ensure dining halls accommodate all dietary restrictions.
The senate also automatically confirmed Justin Zaslavsky as SMHS-G senator after his opponent did not attend the Monday meeting.

Newly elected SA President Arielle Geismar said the SA is powerful and incredibly important to GW because it serves as a “connector” and “distributor” for student resources. She said she is looking forward to sharing responsibility with senators this year and collaborating with “open communication.”
“I’m committed to having a very positive and friendly relationship between our executive team and the Senate this year, and I’m really looking forward to utilizing the power together,” Geismar said.
Newly elected SA Vice President Demetrius Apostolis said he will work this year to create a body of staff to support senators and their initiatives, and that the applications for the staff positions are “going well.” He said he will work with Geismar as a team to address students’ needs instead of operating as two separate branches of leadership.
“I’m super excited to work with President Geismar this year,” Apostolis said. “I’m really excited that we’ll be able to make a great team and have communication and really turn a new leaf in the Student Association.”
Senators unanimously confirmed Ishana Bandyopadhyay and Nathan Nguyen as chief of staff and senior director of the Legislative Budget Office, respectively.
The next SA Senate meeting will be held May 8 at 8:00 p.m. in 1957 E Street 211.

Vice President Kamala Harris concluded Wednesday's forum with a discussion in Lisner Auditorium. 
Updated: Monday, May 8, 2023, at 3:46 p.m.
Government officials, artists and media professionals from the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community celebrated the beginning of AANHPI Heritage Month in a White House forum Wednesday.
The daylong event featured panels with industry experts and politicians at Lisner Auditorium, including a discussion with Vice President Kamala Harris, who encouraged aspiring AANHPI leaders to represent their communities in government. The forum, themed “Visible Together,” was hosted by the White House and officials from the White House Initiative on AANHPI and drew more than 1,300 attendees. 
The event served as part of the initiative announced in January, which aims to provide a “whole-of-government agenda” that advances equity, justice and opportunity for AANHPI communities. TV host Jeannie Mai Jenkins and White House Senior Advisor for Public Engagement Philip Kim emceed the panels, which were interspersed with performances from AANHPI artists.
Jenkins and Kim introduced interim University President Mark Wrighton, who said he hopes the forum provides people with more resources to create a positive impact on communities internationally and locally. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) also delivered opening remarks.
Here are some of the forum’s highlights:
Vice President Harris talks family background, White House action to address hate crimes
Harris discussed her Indian-American heritage and actions the Biden administration has taken to protect AANHPI communities from gun violence in a discussion moderated by Jerry Won, CEO of Just Like Media and Poorna Jagannatha, an actress who stars in Netflix’s “Never Have I Ever” TV show.
Harris said her mother, who came to the United States in 1959 in one of the first waves of Indian-American immigrants, was “so comfortable and clear” about where she came from and who she was. She said she remembers her grandfather, who was an Indian government official during the country’s independence movement, talking about “fighting for democracy” and equality when she was a child. 
Harris said being raised in a family and community where there was a “real fight” to uphold the importance of independence and identity is part of her “story.”  
“My mother would often say, ‘You don’t let people tell you who you are, you tell them who you are,’” Harris said.
Harris said there has been a “horrendous rise” in hate crimes toward Asian communities and that the Biden administration has passed “smart” gun safety legislation when asked about what the administration has done to protect AANHPI communities from gun violence. She said the administration has “more to do” and advocated for a national assault weapons ban, background checks and red-flag laws, which allow courts to remove weapons from people deemed a threat to themselves or others.
“We should not be seduced into perpetuating this false choice that suggests you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want reasonable gun safety laws,” Harris said. “I support the Second Amendment.”
There were 746 attacks targeting people of Asian descent in 2021, up approximately 200 percent from 2020 and the most ever recorded in a single year, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation updated in March. President Joe Biden issued an executive order aiming to increase background checks and promote better firearm storage on March 14 and signed a bill in June 2022 that gives incentives to states that pass red-flag laws.
Harris said younger generations of immigrant families share a growing recognition that their representation in government matters. She said aspiring AANHPI leaders may find they are the only one who looks a certain way or has certain lived experiences when they walk into a room, and that in those situations, they are representing the voices of “so many people who are proud that you’re in that room.”
“We are all in that room with you,” Harris said.
AANHPI creatives talk artistic achievement, gender identity
Poet Rupi Kaur, actor Daniel Dae Kim, producer and transgender rights advocate Geena Rocero and CEO of Hawaiian creative firm Gravitas Pasifika Aaron Salā discussed AANHPI art and identity with moderator Bing Chen, CEO of the Asian creative nonprofit Gold House. 
Kaur said people should continue to “celebrate” works by AANHPI authors to prevent school officials and politicians from silencing their voices with recent book bans. 30 percent of books banned from January to December 2022 were about race, racism, or feature characters of color. Kaur’s “Milk and Honey” was tied with “The Bluest Eye” and “This Book Is Gay” as the fifth-most banned book during that period, according to PEN America.
Kaur said she was laughed at when she told “industry gatekeepers” she wanted to publish a book of poetry because they believed there was no market for her pieces.
“They couldn’t have imagined that a brown girl would write a book that would one day outsell Homer’s ‘The Odyssey’ and become the highest-selling book of poetry of all time,” Kaur said.
Kim, who starred in “Lost,” said it is “really important” for people outside the AANHPI community to continue their support of Asian-American art, citing the recent success of award-winning international movies like “Parasite,” a South Korean film, and “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” a film centered around Chinese-American characters and the most awarded movie in history.
“We’re no longer saying, wow, we support this because it’s an Asian-American film, we’re saying we support it because it’s a f*cking amazing film.”
Rocero, a transgender Filipina, said cisgender people have told stories about her culture for “so long” and that gender fluidity is in the “DNA” of AANHPI culture, pointing to Filipino “babaylan” spiritual leaders who practiced gender-crossing, the Indian “hijra” community of intersex and transgender people and nonbinary communities like American Samoa’s “faʻafafine” and Hawaii’s “māhū.”
“We need to honor that, particularly as we’re centering stories,” Rocero said.
Media professionals, activists discuss AANHPI empowerment
DIVE Studios Creative Director Eric Nam, Teen Vogue Editor In Chief Versha Sharma, executive director of the LA-based social justice organization Empowering Pacific Islander Communities Estella Owoimaha-Church and Asian Americans Advancing Justice President John Yang discussed the theme of the panel, “The Power of the AA and NHPI Voice,” with moderator Lisa Ling, the host and executive producer of CNN’s “This Is Life.”
Nam said he and the entire AANHPI community are “still developing” their voice and said AANHPI representation in media has helped amplify their experiences in society.
“For a long time, we were told we don’t have space in the spaces that we exist,” Nam said. “In recent years, we’re seeing ourselves represented in media, in so many incredible places and we’re just now starting to get our footing and getting comfortable with expressing ourselves to our fullest ability.”
Sharma said she felt “othered” growing up in central Louisiana and described Ling as a role model and trailblazer for Asian-American representation in media. She said she is “very proud” to have put four South Asian people on the cover of Teen Vogue as editor-in-chief.
Yang said all of the event’s panelists want to tell the story of who they are as AANHPI people, which serves as the “common link” between speakers who come from different backgrounds. He said AANHPI people must participate in politics to protect their “vulnerable” communities.
“Democracy is not a spectator sport,” Yang said. “It is a sport we must all participate in.”

Emergency responders survey 21st and I streets near the memorial for Shawn O'Donnell, a cyclist who a truck driver struck and killed at the same intersection in July. 
The driver of a charter bus struck a woman riding a Lime scooter on the corner of 21st and I streets Thursday morning.
D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Vito Maggiolo said the woman sustained “minor” injuries. He said FEMS officials dispatched four medical personnel and an American Medical Response ambulance to the scene at 8:45 a.m. after an Academy charter bus struck the woman. 
A Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson said the woman was transported to a nearby hospital.  
The collision took place at the same intersection where a truck driver struck and killed Shawn O’Donnell in July while she was cycling before a newly installed traffic light on the street became operational, which community members and local leaders said could have prevented her death.

Officials approved one dose of the bivalent mRNA vaccine, which has both the original and omicron coronavirus strains, as an equivalent for the preexisting two-dose mandate, according to an email to community members Tuesday.
GW will accept either the primary series of monovalent mRNA vaccines, like the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccines and booster dose, or a single dose of the bivalent mRNA vaccine, the email states. The announcement updates the University’s COVID-19 vaccine requirements and follows the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the single-dose series and the agency’s revoking of the initial Moderna and Pfizer monovalent vaccine authorization last month.
The email states that those already in compliance with vaccine requirements do not need to get an additional vaccine but recommends individuals who do not currently meet the University requirement receive a dose of the bivalent vaccine. The FDA states that individuals previously vaccinated with a monovalent vaccine may receive one dose of the bivalent vaccine and first-time vaccine recipients may receive one dose of the bivalent vaccine instead of the original monovalent vaccines.
“Community members who are already in compliance with GW’s vaccine mandate do not need to take any action, but it is strongly recommended for everyone to have a bivalent vaccine,” the email states.
Students cannot register for classes until they meet the University’s vaccination requirements, unless they are granted a religious or medical exception, according to the email.
GW first instituted a vaccine requirement for GW community members in August 2021 and 90 percent of the GW community was fully vaccinated with two monovalent doses that month. The University also required students, faculty and staff to receive a booster dose of the COVID vaccine by February 2022.
The email states GW community members can receive the bivalent COVID vaccine at local pharmacies and doctors’ offices and directs community members to VaccineFinder.org.
