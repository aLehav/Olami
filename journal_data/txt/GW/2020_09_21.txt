Between the COVID-19 pandemic, a gloomy economy and the specter of climate change, our generation is facing an uncertain future because of today’s problems. Yet the voices and activism of young people on these issues are often belittled or suppressed by politicians. The president himself has repeatedly bashed and cast doubt on mail-in voting, the method by which students generally vote. As a consequence, public policy, like the federal response to the pandemic, has largely ignored college students. 
For our issues to be taken seriously in spite of these obstacles, one of the most important things to do is ensure our votes are counted this November. 
If young people voted in the same numbers as previous generations, it would reshape the electorate and shift the focus toward the issues we care about, like climate change and the cost of college. That’s what happened in the 2018 midterms – youth turnout doubled, ushering into office the youngest and most diverse group of federal legislators in history. We have a responsibility to keep speaking out and participating to effect long-lasting change. And this November, that means turning out to vote. Each and every vote has never been more important – and almost all of us are back home to be able to do it. 
Almost all of the existential problems our generation will inherit will have been handed to us by policymakers from previous generations. None of us had a say in demolishing the economy in 2008 or allowing the climate to heat up. Even now, young people barely merit a second thought in policy decisions. The federal pandemic response, for example, deliberately excluded college students from direct cash payouts. We will be responsible for fixing those problems eventually – and even if we cannot make them disappear right away, we can still slow their advance by showing up at the polls. 
Our vote is even more critical because of the unique stakes of this election. The trite refrain of “this is the most important election of our lifetime” happens to be true this year. The Trump administration has actively damaged democracy at home and abroad. At this moment, he is attempting to make the November election unfree and unfair by sabotaging the United States Postal Service – cutting funding, dismantling ballot-sorting machines and increasing delivery times. These steps constitute an active attempt to reduce the number of ballots counted this year – and the best way to push back against that is to turn out in historic numbers. Put simply, turning out this year may be the only way we can vote in free and fair elections in 2024. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has also brought both new challenges and opportunities for our generation to vote. While college students typically vote by mail because they’re on campus, it may be easier to cast a ballot this election cycle while students are living at their childhood homes or permanent residences. Being at home makes it easier for many students to receive and send their mail-in ballot or show up at a polling place if they feel comfortable and safe turning out in person. Going to the polls or mailing in your ballot with parents, family or friends can lessen the difficulty or boredom associated with casting a vote and help remind you to request your ballot and cast your vote amid schoolwork and classes. There’s no excuse this year. 
Though some aspects of the virtual semester make it easier for students to vote, others can be seriously detrimental. Actually registering to vote can be a barrier for many students. In states like Louisiana, those wanting to register to vote have to print out forms and documents, which could post a barrier to people without printers. In some states like Georgia and Wisconsin, you need several forms of identification, which can be a barrier for someone who maybe never got their driver’s license. All of these may seem trivial but are just one more step between wanting to vote and actually casting a ballot. 
In this election, for most students, voting will only take a few minutes in between the activism necessary to enact systemic change. Yet the upsides of doing so are tremendous, even if you live in a solidly Democratic or Republican state. Do some research on your jurisdiction’s voter registration rules and down-ballot races. Find out where your nearest polling place or ballot drop box is. And vote.

College students have been put through hell for the last six months. They’ve been ripped away from their school friends, needed to readjust to living and studying at home and are constantly worried about an uncertain future. And some college students have unfortunately tacked one more issue onto the list – being scapegoated for COVID-19 outbreaks on campuses.
Northeastern University recently made news for the draconian way it disciplined students who were caught hanging out maskless in a residence hall. Not only were the students expelled, but the university refused to return any of their nearly $40,000 in tuition for the semester. Students and parents were rightly aghast. But this episode is only one example of a troubling trend of colleges blaming their students for COVID-19 outbreaks that should have been administrators’ job to prevent. Solely relying on students’ willpower to prevent outbreaks on campuses is naive – and if colleges aren’t willing to confront the reality of in-person education during a pandemic, then they should follow GW’s lead and keep campuses closed until it is over.
Colleges that have reopened campuses – even in a limited capacity – risk causing virus outbreaks. The chief solution that some universities – including Northeastern, apparently – have come up with is to place the onus on students to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. And if students break the rules, their university hangs them out to dry and heaps scorn on the student body for being reckless and selfish. Other schools like Syracuse University and the University of Pittsburgh have suspended students for partying, but Northeastern’s response was unique in its severity.
The simple reality of pandemic-era college education is that students are going to gather if given the chance. Students watched the lives they had built at college collapse as the pandemic brought the world to its knees. Most then spent six months in their childhood homes, with the best substitute for social interaction being a grainy Zoom image on their laptop screen. Not to mention they have watched their government fail to fight the virus in a way that prevents death and economic disarray. After enduring the unendurable for half a year, there should be no doubt in anybody’s mind that students will try and claw back any semblance of normalcy they can if campuses reopen. When nearly half of young people are presenting signs of anxiety or depression because of the stress and isolation of the pandemic, reuniting with their friends is not a capricious luxury – it is a survival instinct.
To be fair, it would be foolhardy and wrong to merely suggest that students who violate mask mandates and flaunt social distancing rules are justified in doing so. Plenty of rule-breaking can be chalked up to sheer foolishness – like fraternities covering up COVID-19 diagnoses or holding parties. But that is not the point – the point is that relying on the threat of punishment is a cynical, naive and ineffectual way to prevent college students from congregating. Colleges need to have empathy and realize that college students will walk over broken glass right now if it means human contact – and they should shape policy accordingly. And if there is no safe way for students to gather and spend time together safely, then campuses simply should not reopen. GW made that agonizing decision – administrators put the health and well-being of students first and foremost. Even though bringing the student body back to Foggy Bottom would have been the smartest choice for the University’s tanking budget, the risks of an outbreak were too high to justify that course of action. More colleges should make that same calculation and follow the path GW has taken.
It is on everybody – including college students – to be responsible citizens and comply with pandemic-era restrictions. But slip-ups are inevitable for those experiencing unfathomable stress and loneliness. If colleges are going to blame their students and take their tuition money instead of figuring out ways to make campus living safe, then campuses should not open in person at all this academic year.

Former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday of complications from pancreatic cancer she had been fighting for years. Her passing marks a serious loss for the country and to the thousands of women and young girls that she helped to inspire – myself included.
Without her fight and without her spirit, many women would not have the liberties that we have today. Ginsburg was a trailblazer for abortion rights and gender and marriage equality, just to name a few. Because of her fight for equal rights for women, women like me are able to be protected under the Constitution’s equal rights protections. She’s the reason I can proudly say I’m a feminist, and she’s the reason we must continue fighting for equal rights as men.
Hannah Thacker | Opinions Editor
I grew up naive to issues of gender and marriage inequality – for a long time I didn’t consider myself a feminist. I thought women can do anything men can and that there was no need for such terms and ideas as feminism. As I got older and learned more, I realized the only reason I was able to think that I could do anything a man can was because of the women who came before me – women like Ginsburg who fought for women’s rights to be seen as human rights. We owe it to her, to her legacy and her memory to remember and recognize everything she has done for us.
We all stand on the shoulders of those that came before us. Women today stand on the shoulders of people like Ginsburg, who was willing to risk everything and challenge the status quo and fight for what she thought was right. So many of the rights we take for granted today are because of women like Ginsburg. We take for granted that we are able to apply to the same jobs as men, that we are able to have the same educational and financial opportunities and that we are able to have autonomy over our own person. Now that the Supreme Court justice is gone, we can’t forget what she did for us, and we can’t let history repeat itself – we must follow in her footsteps and stand at the forefront of the fight for gender equality.
Women can carry her legacy in their personal lives and careers. We must push for the same wage as men. We can fight for authority positions in our place of work and throw away the notion that any of us are merely meant to be a “housewife.” The struggle for equal rights as men has gone on for centuries – but Ginsburg has reassured us that it’s not an impossible feat.
While many conversations surrounding her passing have been focused on her potential replacement, political parties and President Donald Trump’s next nomination, we must remember that her life made a serious impact on the soul of our nation. RBG was more than just a political prop that stands between a conservative Supreme Court and a more liberal court. She represents decades of work toward women’s equality. Her character and her spirit will live on in any person who looked to her as a symbol of hope, both in her personal life and work in the highest court in the country.
Her passing should be felt as a loss to women all across the country, no matter their political party or ideology. What Ginsburg stood for was more than something that could be prescribed to a political party. Her death must not be seen as a marker of political importance but as a marker of social importance that affects us all. We have a responsibility to carry on her legacy.

The goal of the research is to develop a building code and emergency communication recommendations for handling hurricanes in the future.
Researchers from the Milken Institute School of Public Health received a grant earlier this month that will allow them to investigate building failure that Puerto Rico experienced during Hurricane Maria.
Public health school officials signed a $1 million contract with the National Institute of Standards in Technology to identify the number of deaths that were caused by building failure in Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria. The partnership comes almost two years after Milken researchers discovered that nearly 3,000 people in Puerto Rico had died from the hurricane, a number much larger than what the White House had released to the public.
“The team will create an integrated database of existing administrative records from the government of Puerto Rico, hospitals and others to identify and classify deaths related to Hurricane Maria,” a public health school release about the project states.
Judith Mitrani-Reiser, the associate chief of materials and structural divisions at NIST and the lead investigator on the project, said the project is organized into four parts that will investigate the environmental hazards that led to building failure during the hurricane, and develop building codes and emergency communication recommendations for handling hurricanes in the future.
She said the investigators will look into both the environmental hazards that led to building failure in Puerto Rico and how the structure of the buildings could have influenced their stability.
“We’re trying to understand what were these environmental contributions that lead potentially to failures of structures,” she said.
She said the project will determine recommendations for national building code standards that could be used in areas throughout the United States.
“A lot of the lessons that we’re learning from all of these projects can be applied to any area in our country that has an exposure to hurricane risk,” she said.
She added that the project isn’t meant to produce an updated death count but instead will focus on the causes of death during the hurricane.
“So trying to understand truly the injury mechanisms and the series of events that led to someone perishing in the event, and then where we can learn how failures of buildings and building systems may have played a role in that,” she said.
Carlos Santos-Burgoa, a professor of global public health and the principal investigator from GW, did not return multiple requests for comment.

About one in 14 community health centers have closed nationwide since the pandemic began.
Researchers from the Milken Institute School of Public Health published a study earlier this month revealing that millions of Americans are at risk of losing access to community health centers because of a lack of funding.
The report, which is published annually using the Health Resources and Services Administration’s data on health centers, shows that visits to community health centers had dropped by about 20 percent by late August since before the pandemic and about one out of 14 centers have closed nationwide. Jessica Sharac, a research scientist in the Department of Health Policy Management, said community health centers provide services like dental care and transportation that people risk losing long-term access to.
Sharac said she worked with Geiger Gibson/RCHN Community Health Foundation to compile the report for 2019, and she and her team are using financial and demographic data from HRSA to track how the pandemic is affecting community health centers on a weekly basis.
She said HRSA is reporting how many centers have closed, the decline in weekly visits to centers and the percentage of staff that is unable to work due to safety concerns from the pandemic.
The report found that nearly 30 million Americans – many who are racial and ethnic minorities – received care at a federally funded health center in 2019.
Sharac said community health centers are missing large amounts of revenue because of a drop in patient visits and a lack of federal funding, which could lead to multiple closures. She added that the Affordable Care Act provided funding for community health centers, but centers could lose federal funding after the CARES Act’s funding runs out in November.
“The big problem really facing community health centers right now is financial uncertainty,” Sharac said. “Obviously with the decline in visits to community health centers because of people being afraid to go out to get health care and trying to stay indoors, they might not be able afford health care because they lost a job or similar things like that.”
Public health experts said community health center closures put uninsured community members at risk of losing their care in the long term.
Leila Barraza, an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona, said many people haven’t been accessing the regular care they need from primary care doctors, including at community health centers, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She said people with underlying medical conditions who are at a greater risk for contracting COVID-19 may have trouble accessing the health care they need if their community health center has closed and they don’t have another primary care doctor.
“People still need their primary care,” she said. “We know that people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19, so those underlying conditions, people still need care for those.”
Tara McCollum Plese, the chief external affairs officer for the Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers, said health centers in Arizona have started to offer telemedicine options for patients who don’t want to come into the office, which she said can make reimbursements for doctors complicated because telemedicine costs less than in-person care.
The Medical Faculty Associates started offering virtual follow-up visits for patients who received care at the emergency department, which medical experts said can complicate the reimbursement process for health care providers.
“The funding issue is paramount because if you don’t have a good strong workforce, it is almost impossible to serve the people in that community,” Plese said.
She added that policymakers and public health officials should use data like the information compiled in Sharac’s report to guide their decisions about how they’ll fund community health centers moving forward.
“Those people with chronic diseases may find themselves concerned about not having seen their primary care provider in a certain period of time,” she said. “Especially if they’re diabetic or have asthma, this is really the time that this is most critical that they be able to touch base with their primary care providers.”

As of Sunday, GW's COVID-19 dashboard showed 10 positives from about 9,500 total tests on GW community members.
Experts in public health data said the University’s COVID-19 tracking dashboard will help students and officials make informed decisions about how to handle the pandemic.
The dashboard, which was released last week, will provide daily updates on the 4,000 on-campus community members who are required to be tested weekly, the dashboard’s website states. Officials said in a release that they hope the dashboard will “ensure transparency” as they start to discuss if and when students can return to campus.
The dashboard uses interactive bar chart graphics to display daily total administered tests, daily total positives and seven-day positive rates as well as a breakdown into student and employee results, reason for getting tested and affiliated campus. Milken Institute School of Public Health researchers developed the University’s diagnostic tests, which will be processed in an on-campus public health lab, the website states.
“We are continuing to gather information about the current spread of the virus and projections about its trajectory – both in the D.C. region and nationally – and how these factors and any local government limitations will affect our operations next semester,” University President Thomas LeBlanc said in the release.
As of Sunday, the dashboard showed 10 positive cases after testing 9,453 community members.
Health experts said releasing COVID-19 data in an understandable way is crucial for officials to maintain trust between them and the community they’re guiding through the pandemic.
Kasisomayajula Viswanath, a professor of health communication at Harvard University, said college campuses should release testing data to promote informed decision-making on how to operate during the pandemic. He said the surrounding residents of a city college campus are an equally relevant audience for this data because they interact with students in their community.
Foggy Bottom community members voiced concerns last month that off-campus students’ return to the neighborhood could put Foggy Bottom’s elderly community at risk of contracting the virus. Some members of a fraternity also contracted the virus after attending an off-campus party earlier this month.
“It is essential for them to know how safe it is to enter the buildings, not enter the buildings, attend in our classes and not attend classes, open the restaurants and not open the restaurants,” Viswanath said. “All these decisions will depend upon the information they get.”
Viswanath said public health communication during emergencies depends on “three principles of transparency, trust and credibility.”
“We are demanding a lot of people in the COVID-19 context,” he said. “So if you want people to comply, they should be able to trust you and you should have the credibility. The open release of this data is a first step toward building that.”
With at least 88,000 positive COVID-19 cases across 1,600 college campuses, the GW dashboard joins the effort of many universities, like Boston and Syracuse universities, to distribute testing data to its community.
Rolf Halden, the director of the Center for Environmental Health Engineering at the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University, said this type of public access to data is necessary to combat COVID-19 on a uniform, national level so citizens and government officials can make decisions about their COVID-19 strategy using the same basic information.
“Society is at a critical juncture,” Halden said. “We know how powerful data is, and we know and appreciate certain data is withheld from us for various reasons to control public opinion. But when it comes to our health and the health of our families and loved ones and the health of not only the country and its population but also the economy, I think everyone has a right to access this data.”
Halden said GW’s dashboard is a step in the right direction for the community because it shows transparency in the University’s handling of the pandemic and allows students and community members to make informed decisions as they navigate the pandemic.
“Obviously, it’s the first step and there could be more data on it, but it’s an important step because it signals that your community is willing to share data that is available, and that reflects the health status of your community,” he said.

Students on the Division of Safety and Facilities' Student Advisory Board spent last week's meeting questioning officers about safety on campus during the pandemic and their response to social justice movements.
Updated: Sept. 21, 2020 at 4:25 p.m.
After months of calls for campus police reform, officials reassembled the Division of Safety and Facilities’ Student Advisory Board this month to evaluate students’ demands.
Second-year graduate student Rebecca Bizzarri, the coordinator for the student advisory board, said board members convened for their first meeting of the academic year Tuesday, during which students reported to officials like GW Police Department Chief James Tate. Bizzarri said the board consists of 12 undergraduate and graduate students who will meet every three weeks throughout the school year to share feedback about campus safety and discuss initiatives.
GWPD established the student advisory board in 2018 to better connect students with the department and discuss on-campus safety concerns.
“As we enter the third academic year since the formation of the Student Advisory Board, the division remains committed to our goal of promoting transparency and collaboration between staff and students through the Student Advisory Board,” Bizzarri said in an email.
Bizzarri said board members can participate in personnel hiring, join safety walks through campus and provide input for the Return to Campus plan, as officials prioritize transparency to keep students engaged with University planning.
“Opportunities to participate in safety initiatives are ever-involving, and we are thankful to have a committed group of students willing to lend a hand and provide feedback on a number of different topics,” she said.
Tate mentioned the advisory board last month as he unveiled his vision for GWPD to promote community involvement and institute new reforms – including body-worn cameras, a training program and plans this fall to hire a community outreach officer who will meet with students on the board.
He said students beyond the board can now join the GWPD officer hiring process and interview new officers themselves. He said he plans to reach out to student organizations like the Student Association and Black Student Union to involve more students in officer hiring.
Anna Weber, the Student Association’s vice president for campus operations, said she serves on the board alongside other members of the SA, BSU and Residence Hall Association. Students spent last week’s meeting asking officials questions about how GWPD plans to address safety during the pandemic and social justice issues like the Black Lives Matter movement, she said.
Tate told board members he hopes to minimize officers’ contact with students during the pandemic, limit their presence in the area and market the department as a community-wide resource for student safety, Weber said. She said officials have welcomed students’ perspectives and she hopes GWPD can continue to build relationships with students.
“GWPD should be a resource for the community, not a burden, and I feel like being on this board is a way to make sure that that’s actually happening,” Weber said.
Weber said officials updated the board on last month’s reforms to GWPD and introduced members to The GW Guardian App, designed to replace GW PAL, connect students with GWPD and provide a new Safety Timer that monitors late-night activity. She said Scott Burnotes, the vice president for the Division of Safety & Facilities, suggested officials increase nighttime lighting on campus, as students mentioned they felt less safe at night when campus is relatively deserted.
“Because campus is less dense, it can be really, really scary at night, hence why you would look at things like lighting or video surveillance or all of those other components under safety and facilities that you can use instead of having officers patrolling campus because cops at every corner are not the solution,” she said.
SA Sen. Sam Packer, CCAS-U, who also serves on the student advisory board, said this year’s panel will grant students greater access to police officers than a city police department, adding that student activists want better communication with GWPD so they can feel safer when protesting on campus.
Earlier this year, an officer who allegedly pushed a student down several stairs outside University President Thomas Leblanc’s on-campus residence was placed on administrative leave, and officials later announced plans to reform GWPD practices. BSU wrote a letter to the department in June, demanding that officers strengthen their relationship with students.
“We wouldn’t want another incident like what happened in the spring to occur again, and hopefully with better communication, we protesters can do our action without having to risk altercations with GWPD,” Packer said.
Packer said she will maintain “constant open communication” with students as she serves on the board this fall, and she wants to ensure GWPD training and guidelines are effective in preventing violence on campus.
“It is more important than ever that people of color, LGBTQ people and activists all feel protected by our campus security, not threatened due to similarities to the police that have been acting so violently around the country,” she said.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that 12 undergraduate students serve on the board. There are a total of 12 undergraduate and graduate students on the board. We regret this error.
