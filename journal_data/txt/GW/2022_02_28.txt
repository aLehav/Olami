“always meeting people / with a mean mug always / brooding out of the blue / the world calls you difficult / a black girl with attitude.”
These lines came to mind after a relative criticized my aloof personality. I had grown accustomed to such rebuke, but I still wrote the words with wearied fury. I found solace in them. They were my sanctuary against everything anti-Black, anti-woman or anti-attitude. They were my rebellion against a world fomenting the intersection of these antagonisms. I thought the poem would speak to the smart-mouths. Because those women never needed anybody to speak for them. I wanted it to talk to the ladies who like to talk back. My words were reserved for the so-called Divas, Ice Queens and Sapphires – titles and tropes tailored to independent Black women while our white counterparts are embraced as edgy or exciting. Few people affirm the Black Girl With Attitude, but I will. She matters to me. She is me.
In the 2004 film “Mean Girls,” artsy outcast Janis Ian gives new student Cady Heron a hand-drawn map of the cafeteria cliques at North Shore High School. The camera then conducts a cursory pan of the illustrated groups as Ian assigns a label to each. As a table seating Black teenagers appears on screen, Ian issues another designation. Unfriendly Black Hotties. Throughout my childhood, I had confronted similar labels. Difficult. Stubborn. Snooty. Attitudy. Black girls that seem sulky are problematized, pathologized. They are perceived as in need of correction. In a 2020 Georgetown report on the lived experiences of Black women and girls, participants described educators perceiving them as sassy or threatening as early as preschool. Participants cited this stereotype as a reason for Black girls’ disproportionate rates of disciplinary action. These findings align with a 2020 New York Times analysis of the Department of Education’s discipline data. The Times found that Black girls are suspended from school at least once five times more frequently than white girls and that they are referred to law enforcement three times more frequently.
At 10, I experienced the same policing of my personality. I endured the same remarks implying my justified punishment. Once, I went to a white friend’s home where an innocent visit escalated to an insulting encounter. While in my friend’s bedroom, we talked as she presented her new toys. Later, she left for a few minutes to retrieve an item from another room. I sat there quietly awaiting her return. Then, I approached a bulletin board hanging on her wall. As I stood there staring silently at the board, her father stopped near the doorway. He greeted me, and I replied politely but without visible enthusiasm. Bothered by my blank face, he said simply, “How about a smile?” It was more of a command than a question. My face gradually underwent a forced grin – one fit for a “Happy Negro,” the mask assumed in writer Paul Laurence Dunbar’s famous poem. He had fixed my face into a broken smile. It is an expression well-worn among Black girls who intuit the kind of fate that awaits their frowns.
The only time I felt confident, instead of condemned, as a petulant child was when I listened to rap music. It was the sound of scowling swagger, and I reveled in it. I grew up with Lil Wayne’s legendary 2008 record “A Milli,” on which he laced blistering lyricism with bleeding bass. Whenever I rapped the song in all its overbearing braggadocio, I felt liberated. Ensconced in this sizzling noise, I could finally conquer the comments directed at me. I could fuel myself with people’s enmity, rise as a phoenix from their fire.
While Wayne taught me how to fight the world’s fire with my own, his protege Nicki Minaj made me feel empowered as a sullen Black girl. Here was a Queen, a Black Barbie, making the planet tremble at her dominant personality. In a clip from her 2010 documentary “My Time Now,” Minaj addresses the backlash she faces because of this dominance. “When I am assertive, I’m a bitch. When a man is assertive, he’s a boss. He bossed up!” she says in the footage. “No negative connotation behind bossed up. But lots of negative connotation behind being a bitch.” It was because she sought to dismantle this double standard that I worshiped Minaj. Her bars were frigid, unflinching. “Bitch, I get money, so I do’s what I pleases / I live where the motherfuckin’ pools and the trees is,” she raps on “Did It On’em,” a song from her 2010 debut album. She was equally impenitent on the 2014 single “Only,” asserting: “When I walk in, sit up straight / I don’t give a f— if I was late.” These lyrics validated my eye rolls, mean mugs and hand waves. They were the words of a Black woman with a dimpled smile and withering glare. The words of a Boss Ass Bitch.
Negative perceptions of assertive Black women continue to pervade our society. In a 2021 study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology, researchers found that when a Black woman shows anger in the workplace, observers give her poorer performance evaluations than Black men, white men and white women due to stereotype activation. Rumors about Vice President Kamala Harris creating a toxic work environment and displaying a domineering leadership style have also persisted since her presidential campaign. And complaints about the tone-policing of Black women have been leveled against everyone from former President Donald Trump – who reportedly called Harris “extraordinarily nasty” – to J. Cole, who chided fellow rapper Noname’s “queen tone” in his 2020 song “Snow on tha Bluff.”
I doubt the world will ever welcome a Black woman armed with her own agency. I maintain this skepticism in spite of tremendous contributions from the Ninas and Serenas, the Nickis and Naomis. But still, we triumph as First Ladies and as Madam Vice Presidents. As Queen Bees and founders of – and instrumental figures in – movements ranging from Black Lives Matter to #MeToo. Despite society’s incessant slights, still we reign. Still we rise.

Nathan Smith (left), an assistant professor of pediatrics, and Christopher Cahill (right), the chair of the chemistry department, were honored late last month. 
Two professors were elected fellows of a nationally recognized science research non-profit honoring scientific experts’ advances in their fields.
Nathan Smith, an assistant professor of pediatrics, and Christopher Cahill, the chair of the chemistry department, joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science Honorary Fellows late last month. They said membership in the AAAS will create opportunities for them to network with a national coalition of accomplished researchers and receive international attention for their career achievements.
Smith’s research targets observing how neuromodulators, chemicals like dopamine that regulate nerve cell populations, interact with astrocytes – star-shaped non-nerve cells – to deter disease progression in the central nervous system. Cahill’s research focuses on studying how nuclear energy and waste production can use F-elements – chemical substances located at the bottom of the periodic table.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton – who himself was elected to the AAAS in 1986 – congratulated Cahill and Smith’s appointments as AAAS Fellows at a Board of Trustees meeting earlier this month, saying the honor recognizes them as “outstanding” contributors to science.
“We have a distinguished and key faculty leadership that is really making important contributions in their areas of activity,” he said at the Board meeting.
The AAAS Honorary Fellows are a group of scientists and engineers who are annually honored for their achievements in research, teaching and interpreting scientific information to the public, according to the AAAS website.
Smith said he is honored to be an AAAS Fellow because his experience as a Black professional in medicine can serve as an example for others who come from similar backgrounds and motivate them to not give up on their scientific research journeys.
He said he will share information about the benefits of the AAAS as a spokesperson to other scientists from minority backgrounds in hopes of recruiting more members of color.
Smith said he hopes to discuss and disseminate his research on nerve cell interactions with other neuroscience experts to treat diseases in the central nervous system while advocating for more diversity, equity and inclusion within the AAAS.
He said the fellowship comes with access to a network of scientific experts within the AAAS community and the prestige that the District-based organization carries as a national center for scientific research with notable fellows like Thomas Edison.
“Diversity powers innovation, and in order for science to continue to move forward, we need a more diverse science workforce,” he said.
The AAAS has also recognized University faculty members like Leo Chalupa, a professor of pharmacology, Bernard Wood, a professor of human origins, and Chryssa Kouveliotou, the chair of the physics department, as fellows in the past.
Cahill said the title as an AAAS Fellow helps him meet and engage with other members of the scientific community if he ever needs advice for future research projects and proposals.
He said he hopes to get more involved in science policy like nuclear energy and waste production, which he’s developed an interest for in the past decade. He said while the fellowship won’t directly impact his research with benefits like grant funding, he hopes to continue attracting more graduate and undergraduate researchers to help out in light of their contributions to the studies that have helped him garner AAAS recognition.
“I want to be sort of crystal clear on that – pun intended there because I’m a crystallographer – but this is really as much about the student accomplishments as it is mine,” he said.
Keith Crandall – a member of the 2013 class of AAAS Fellows and the director of the Computational Biology Institute, a GW research institution that combines computer use with biology and medicine – said scientific experts in the AAAS should recognize other “extraordinary” research projects that fellows complete because research funding overlooks the researchers’ efforts for the studies, focusing more on the type of content they include.
He said AAAS fellowship means one’s research has received international attention.
“It’s always nice to have somebody pat you on the back and say ‘Good job,’ and that’s what it is,” Crandall said. “It’s an emotional benefit more than anything.”
Michael Plesniak, the chair of the mechanical and aerospace engineering department and an AAAS Fellow, said becoming a fellow provides a faculty member with more “visibility” as a leader in the AAAS community and a greater opportunity to shape scientific research agenda in the future. Plesniak said the AAAS Fellow title reflects the contributions of research teams that include graduate and undergraduate student researchers and staff in addition to the main professors who lead the research projects.
“I am honored to be part of an impressive group of AAAS Fellows at GW that includes President Wrighton, and I expect that we will see many more deserving GW faculty being recognized in the coming years,” he said in an email.

Phillips and Asim have expanded their TikTok content to include interviews with other student leaders. 
TikTok users at GW have most likely stumbled across the student-run fashion account gwu.fitcheck on their For You pages.
The account, created by senior and Hatchet reporter Rhyma Asim and junior Beatrice Phillips at the end of September, has amassed more than 2,700 followers and tens of thousands of likes since their first TikTok was posted. After becoming friends last summer while living on campus, Asim and Phillips saw a video “blow up” from a Boston University fashion TikTok account, and the duo was inspired to start their own version at GW.
They decided to create gwu.fitcheck as a way to promote students’ outfits and celebrate students’ unique styles.
Since being in college, Phillips said she’s recognized the role fashion can have in self-expression.
“At the end of the day, fashion is just a way to express myself,” she said. “It’s like a look into my character and just putting the inside out.”
Typically, they text each other every couple of weeks to meet in Kogan Plaza and look for students they could feature. While the pair said they don’t have any strict criteria for who they chose to feature, their two rules of thumb are to watch for outfits that catch their eye and not to bother anyone who looks like they might be in a rush.
“Because at the end of the day, this isn’t an account about our personal style,” Phillips said. “It isn’t an account about trends. It’s an account really about what people are wearing at school, so that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily our own personal style or we think it’s on trend. We just want to be like ‘Oh my god, you really put thought into what you’re wearing today.’ Let’s capture that.”
After filming, Asim and Phillips share responsibilities editing the videos, adding text and choosing a sound to go with the visual content.
They both jokingly agree that choosing a sound to play over their videos is the hardest part of the process, which they usually decide together. But one of the easiest parts is finding cool outfits to feature, which Asim said there is usually no shortage of on campus.
Phillips said GW’s fashion scene is reflective of the eccentric style big cities are known for but with more influence from the professional world. She said long coats and blazers are the norm, but they usually feature “funky” patterns and lots of color.
“It’s almost formal with a twist,” she said.
Recently, Phillips and Asim have expanded their TikTok content to include interviews with other student leaders. The account recently featured an interview with Jacy Case, the president of the Student Musician Coalition.
“She told a great story about coming back to campus and playing music and being with Tiny Dorm Concert,” Phillips said. “And had a great outfit for it.”
With this new format, they hope to film short TikToks interviewing students about a community on campus they are a part of and have them share a story about an outfit or clothing item important to them.
“The process is like, ‘make sure you’re wearing something that you can tell a story about, don’t feel pressured to wear something that you think is like the best outfit ever, just wear something you love,’” Phillips said.
Asim said her favorite thing about fashion is its ability to connect people.
“Gaining your sense of style is also just like appreciating other people’s styles and then meeting people that way,” she said.
Since returning to campus from the pandemic, Phillips said she’s noticed students’ confidence in personal style has increased.
“I think sitting at home in quarantine – we were kind of like, ‘You know what, when we go back out finally into the world, I don’t want to have any insecurities about what I wear,’” she said. “I just want to wear what I want because who knows when we’re going to be back in our room.”
Ultimately, they agree that the mission of gwu.fitchek is to celebrate student style and serve as a small way to connect GW students with one another. Although Phillips and Asim haven’t yet discussed plans for gwu.fitcheck once Asim graduates this spring, for now they want to continue highlighting new facets of GW culture.
“Fashion is just like a little pillar of culture,” Phillips said. “And the only way to expand is like going into that culture zone, but we can always put fashion as like a little thread in there.”

FlixBus has offered service in 37 countries since it was founded, originally arriving on the east coast in 2019. 
A new bus stop in Foggy Bottom will give students and locals the opportunity to travel to cities across the East Coast on buses run by a company working to reduce the environmental footprint of its travel.
Locals can purchase FlixBus tickets from the new stop, which was installed earlier this month at the intersection of 19th and E streets for as low as $11. A spokesperson for the German company said tickets come with an option to purchase carbon offset credits that help fund Atmosfair, a nonprofit organization that works to reduce carbon emissions.
The launch of the stop comes after a yearslong effort by the company to install the intercity service in Foggy Bottom, which the COVID-19 pandemic delayed since discussions started in fall 2020. The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission approved the installation of the bus stop in November.
Francesca La Brecque, the business development associate at Flixbus, said the bus company is the first to offer an option for travelers to offset their carbon emissions with an additional 1 to 3 percent cost to their ticket, which funds sustainability projects like planting trees.
“Part of the reason to go with the green color of the buses is we’re really focused on trying to have a greener future,” La Brecque said.
FlixBus has offered service in 39 countries since it was founded in Munich, Germany in 2013, originally arriving on the East Coast in 2019.
La Brecque said the planning for the new stop has been a “long time coming” after working with ANC commissioners for more than a year to settle on the spot near the Elliott School of International Affairs because of its proximity to campus and minimal impact on traffic and parking.
“Once it became clear that the pandemic back in 2020 would be longer than a couple of weeks, we had to figure out on the technical side how the meetings were going to work and restart those conversations as we moved into the period of having buses on the road again,” La Brecque stated.
FlixBus does not have any stops near other universities in D.C. like Georgetown or American universities, but students still account for 15 to 25 percent of customers in D.C. – FlixBus’ second-largest East Coast market.
“Students are a pretty significant portion of our market,” La Brecque said.
La Brecque said the accessibility of the new stop because of its proximity to campus will be one of the highlights for potential passengers, especially if they don’t have a car.
“People tend not to have cars so the closer things are so if you can walk to them certainly makes a difference in terms of that accessibility into long-distance travel,” La Brecque said.
John George, the president of the Foggy Bottom Association, said the new bus stop will be an asset to local residents and workers as well as students.
“Riders consider how easy it is to get to the bus,” George said. “We don’t want to take the Metro to the bus or walk up to Dupont Circle based on where we live.”
George said FlixBus is also providing benefits to residents because of their increased options and lower prices when compared to competitors.
“I think having inter-city transportation is important throughout a major city with competitors like in D.C. so people have choice,” he said. “Choice helps with competitive pricing and picking the way that bus looks or comfort or its schedule.”

Call your Mother first opened in 2018 and has since expanded to six locations with its newest opening in West End.
Foggy Bottom residents don’t have to trek to Georgetown anymore for a taste of Call Your Mother bagels with its new West End location, and next on the deli’s radar is Logan Circle.
The West End location, Call Your Mother Deli’s sixth establishment, opened Jan. 20 in the space previously dedicated to Mercy Me’s breakfast-specific café. Call Your Mother co-owner and founder Andrew Dana said he was involved in opening the South American fare restaurant and pictured one of his bagel shops there since the start.
“We originally almost put a Call Your Mother in there but then decided to do the Mercy Me café and just couldn’t get the idea out of our head,” he said. “So after two years we decided to make the switch and part of that is we wanted Mercy Me to be able to laser focus on providing their amazing dinner experience every day and not be distracted by doing breakfast and lunch.”
The Call Your Mother expansion comes six years after Dana opened Timber Pizza Company, his first restaurant, inspired by his dad.
“Growing up he always used to say ‘Oh I wish I had opened the deli,’ so I had that idea sort of baked in the back of my brain from a young age,” he said. “In college, I stole his line but switched into a pizza restaurant so I said ‘Oh I’m gonna go into marketing’ but realized how to open a pizza restaurant.”
Two years later, when the pizza restaurant became stable enough, Dana found himself with the time and budget to chase an even bigger dream – a bagel shop. Alongside his wife and co-owner Daniela, Dana opened his first Call Your Mother location in the D.C. community in 2018.
Dana said one thing that sets the new West End location apart from the other locations in the local chain is its abundance of seating. Mercy Me’s main dining room and its new Call Your Mother addition are connected to Yours Truly hotel and match its lobby’s aesthetic with a collection of mismatched reclaimed furniture for customers to enjoy their bagels on.
“Our eyes and ears are always open, so we’re always looking for the next great location,” he said.
Another neighborhood Dana received requests from customers to come to was Logan Circle. And now, Call Your Mother’s seventh location is set to open this spring at 1471 P St. NW, in what used to be a Blue Bottle Coffee shop.
Dana said with its seventh store opening this spring, customers can expect to see some new things on the menu including new bagel sandwiches and possibly a whole line of lunch sandwiches.
“Owning restaurants is really hard because you’re only as good as your last day,” he said. “People only remember your last service so you have to be relentless at your approach for quality and great service because even if you’ve been great for 100 days then you have one horrible day that’s what people remember.”
There is no “typical day” for Dana amid the business operation of his six bagel shops.
“Some days I’m working on design of new shops, some days I’m interviewing new general managers, some days I’m just working in the shop,” he said. “So every day is really really different which I think is the best part of my job, so you know I always have a creative outlet.”
Dana said he’s prioritized hiring employees with an intention of creating a welcoming environment for customers.
“We try really hard to only hire really fun, personable people because we want your interaction with the cashier and with the person handing you your food to be absolutely awesome,” he said.
But more than just hiring the right employees, Dana said it’s really about curating the brand.
“We want the branding to be super fun and interactive,” he said. “We look at every detail from music, to branding, to how you’re greeted at the door, while also trying to make the food super fun, and delicious, and with a little hint of nostalgia so you remember your favorite childhood donut or bagel.”

The task force, which is spearheaded by Provost Chris Bracey, is composed of 12 administrators, 10 faculty and four students. 
Faculty and officials said the task force spearheading the University’s diversity review must take the history of discriminatory culture at GW into account to make the improvement of diversity a long-term priority.
Officials unveiled a 26-person team this month composed of faculty, students and administrators who will conduct a comprehensive review of GW’s diversity with plans to make recommendations to University leadership on how to improve campus-wide diversity next spring. Experts in higher education said the yearlong review process should consider marginalized GW community members’ voices and should make plans to continue holding town halls, surveys and listening events after the review process is slated to wrap up next spring.
Last January, then-University President Thomas LeBlanc and then-Provost Brian Blake announced an external diversity audit that an outside firm would conduct to research faculty composition, financial aid packages and police engagement. But Provost Chris Bracey reversed the plan this fall, charging the Office of the Provost with conducting a comprehensive diversity review over the next year.
“The review aims to amplify the voices and experiences of all members of our community,” Bracey said in an email earlier this month. “It will include an assessment of current policies and practices, focus groups and interviews and an external review by a selected board of scholars leading this type of work nationally.”
The task force is composed of 12 administrators, 10 faculty and four students, including SA President Brandon Hill and SA Vice President Kate Carpenter.
Stephen Forssell, the director of the graduate program in LGBT Health Policy and Practice and a member of the task force, said the internal review team understands past discriminatory incidents at GW and wants to make “cultural changes” when it comes to the University’s diversity. He said because the internal review teams members have long tenures at GW, they have institutional knowledge of the University, which can help them accurately assess diversity standards.
“We know a lot about what’s going on, so we can provide an awful lot of perspective – they’re very specific about us,” he said. “You know one of the key foci here is to get faculty truly involved in the process and students as well.”
Forssell said the task force has already met during this academic year and reviewed student and faculty racial and gender makeup, but members will meet more this spring and summer to discuss their long-term plans. He said the review process is “ongoing” and will continue past when the task force has made its final recommendations, but officials should continue to evaluate and improve GW’s diversity.
“When we see the antisemitic comments, we see the racist things that go on that violate students, we can’t ignore those things when we’re talking about creating an environment that’s safe for everybody,” he said.
The review follows a string of racist incidents at GW – in separate incidents in 2018 and 2019, sorority members posted racist images to Snapchat, and in 2020, a white professor admitted to having claimed a Black identity for years. Students said the repeated racist incidents at GW had become “exhausting,” pushing them to turn to the Multicultural Student Services Center or the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement for a safe space on campus.
Former University President Thomas LeBlanc used an analogy to shooting “all the Black people here” when discussing divestment from fossil fuels in 2020, and a white professor said the N-word in a class on anti-racism in STEM education last month.
Members of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity reported that a Torah was desecrated after their house was broken into in the fall as part of a series of antisemitic acts across campus in recent years.
A faculty member also denied a student’s service dog from class earlier this spring, leading more than 4,000 people to sign a petition calling for the professor’s termination.
The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences authorized a search for 12 minority faculty last summer in subjects like criminology, race and mental health disparities to bolster diversity among its professors. The move came after more than 1,000 faculty and students signed a petition last year, calling on officials to “cluster hire” minority faculty members and increase funding for the Africana studies program.
Hispanic and Black undergraduate students at GW have also remained about 10 percentage points below the national average of college-age students, according to 2015 data from the National Center for Education Statistics.
Higher education and diversity experts said the review must focus on changes in enrollments, listening events and faculty makeup and ensure the most diverse set of voices can make recommendations to improve diversity.
Michelle Boettcher, an associate professor of higher education and student affairs at Clemson University, said the diversity review team should consider past incidents of racism at GW and racist policies like the exclusion of Black students under former University President Cloyd Heck Marvin while conducting the review. She said the review can help address the racist history of GW through research and acknowledgment of historic discrimination.
“The history of higher education in this country was not designed to be diverse,” she said. “It hasn’t been developed to be inclusive, so there is a whole bunch of remodeling and rethinking that needs to happen.”
Boettcher said improving the University’s diversity is an ongoing process that should be “cyclical” and repeated in future years and can also include marginalized voices not on the task force in conversations on website forums or in town halls.
“In a sense, we all have agendas,” she said. “We all have goals that we’re working toward, so how many of those pockets and communities can you tap into?”
Rebecca Clothey, an associate professor of education at Drexel University, said diversity reviews can help understand what voices are “missing at the table.” She said if GW has predominantly white and male officials, then the task force should include marginalized voices in its discussions on how to improve diversity.
“Finding out how people feel what kind of incidents have happened that made them uncomfortable and having an open conversation about it and the task force can only do that by talking to the relevant people,” she said.
Marybeth Gasman, a distinguished professor of higher education at Rutgers University, said the task force should be representative across racial and ethnic, gender, sexuality and age groups. She said the large variety of voices can help assess where power is concentrated among the community and encourage discussions on how to increase diversity in positions of power.
“They should be asking who has the power and how are they using it to empower others, and more importantly, how are they using it to include more people in decision making and to bring in more voices,” she said in an email.

Despite finishing with a losing record, GW will participate in the A-10 Championship this week. 
Women’s basketball dropped their final game of the season Saturday afternoon.
The Colonials (11-16, 4-10 A-10) fell to La Salle (15-12, 9-6 A-10) by a score of 62–55, marking their third straight loss as they head into the Atlantic 10 Championship. GW was plagued by turnovers and foul trouble all game, racking up 17 giveaways and putting La Salle on the bonus in the second, third and fourth quarters.
It was an emotional night for graduate student guard Kyara Frames, who played her last regular season game in her collegiate career. She said she is proud of the team for the way they stuck together despite losing the first eight games of conference play this season.
“I think that the most important thing is the effort we’ve put into becoming a better team,” Frames said. “We’ve never put our head down and never quit. Just like today’s game, we had a rough start altogether. That wasn’t our best basketball, but again we fought back. We didn’t get the outcome we wanted, but we’re going to a tournament next, and it’s 0-0 for everybody.”
The Colonials offense struggled from the start and couldn’t find any rhythm in the first quarter, shooting just 2-of-6 from the field.
Freshman forward Maxine Engel notched the first two points for GW at the free throw line, after La Salle opened with 12 straight unanswered points. Both teams continued to trade turnovers before Engel hit a wide-open 3 to cut the deficit to seven with 3:20 left in the quarter.
Sophomore guard Taylor Webster closed the quarter with a strong finish at the rim, making the score 16–7 at the end of the first.
Ball security proved to be a challenge for the Colonials, as they registered four more turnovers than their own points in the first quarter. Head Coach Caroline McCombs said the Explorers’ defense switched between zone and man-to-man throughout the contest to cause GW trouble and keep them out of rhythm.
“I think they did a really good job defensively coming out, switching and denying,” McCombs said. “We didn’t have a rhythm offensively so we were really just throwing it to them.”
The second quarter was a different story for the Colonials offense, netting 22 points compared to just seven in the first. Engel led the way throughout the first half, scoring 15 points and going 3-of-6 from behind the arc.
After an Engel 3 cut the Explorers lead to eight, junior guard Sheslaine Laureano banked in a turnaround jumper high off the glass to put GW back by just two possessions. With 3:45 to go, La Salle, up six, switched to a half-court zone trap that the Colonials were able to take advantage of, going on an 11-9 run that saw Engel hitting a baseline jumper to cut the lead to four at the half.
“We dug ourselves a hole, and they didn’t put their heads down,” McCombs said. “We fought back. I think they were down defensively as well as that was the game plan. So I thought just going in the second quarter, looking at other options to score, other things kind of combating what they were doing on defense to have some better offensive execution.”
Laureano opened the third quarter with a quick 3-ball to slice the La Salle lead to just one.
But GW racked up four fouls in the next three minutes, including a third personal for redshirt junior forward Mayowa Taiwo forcing McCombs to limit her minutes. Foul trouble was a recurring theme in the third, with the Colonials committing nine in the quarter.
“We just have to keep our heads – you can’t control the refs and you can’t control what they’re calling. You can’t control the other team’s mentality,” Taiwo said. “We have to stay within ourselves, keep our own energy and just keep playing hard.”
Taiwo capped off the third with a slick left hand layup off an offensive rebound, putting GW within 3 points of the lead.
The shooting inefficiency continued for the Colonials in the fourth quarter, launching 20 shots and hitting just four of them. Despite this GW kept it close, never going down by more than five until the final possession.
Laureano muscled her way for a jumper inside to tie the game with just less than four minutes to go, setting the stage for a tight finish at the Smith Center. Ultimately, the fouls continued to haunt the Colonials and La Salle’s 65 percent success from the line proved too much to overcome.
Both GW and La Salle will head to the A-10 Championship this week, starting on Wednesday. Despite a losing record of 4-10 in A-10 play, McCombs said she is confident in her squad’s abilities, emphasizing their team-first mentality.
“I think that it’s 0-0 right now, and everyone has the same opportunity right now to go make some noise in the conference tournament,” McCombs said. “And so we’re going to do everything we can to prepare to be our best starting tonight with all the choices that we make moving forward.”
