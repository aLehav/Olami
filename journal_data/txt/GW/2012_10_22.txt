The University will begin construction this summer on its most expensive residence hall – a massive $130 million building that will merge three halls in the center of campus.
The 850-bed mega-hall will include common areas, faculty suites, affinity housing and retail space. Upon completion in 2016, the so-called “superdorm,” will become the second-largest residence hall in Foggy Bottom.
The building, between H and I streets, will house mostly sophomores and juniors after combining the three nearly century-old structures – the freshman Crawford Hall and the sophomore halls The West End and The Schenley. It will add 300 beds to the Foggy Bottom Campus.
The project will add another swath of construction to the Foggy Bottom Campus at a time when there are cranes or dirt ditches on nearly every block.
About 45 percent of the rooms will be singles, while 30 percent are reserved for affinity housing and the remaining 25 percent will become two-bedroom suites.
The 64,000 square feet set aside for student space will likely resemble the common rooms in West Hall on the Mount Vernon Campus, and also feature retail shops, similar to those in the basement of Ivory Tower.
University President Steven Knapp said the food venues lining I Street would transform what is currently the entrance to The West End into “more of a college town,” offering more retail space across the street from The Avenue.
Knapp said the student areas would help build a community in “a city that has a tremendous capacity to draw students off campus” for jobs and internships. He said the Student Association also highlighted common space as a priority.
About six to eight faculty members will live in suites in the new residence hall, increasing the number of live-in professors from nine to more than 17 – part of Provost Steven Lerman’s goal to integrate classroom and residential experiences.
Lerman, who lived in a residence hall during his time as an administrator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said bridging the gap between classes and campus life would ultimately pay off.
The 30 percent of rooms reserved for affinity housing would accommodate increasing interest in the group-based living option. Last year, about 1,200 students – more than double the year before – applied for affinity housing.
“Affinity housing not only gives us more community space, but a richer residence experience,” Lerman said.
The $130 million approved by the Board of Trustees Friday is in addition to the $2.5 million in design funding approved last spring. The University selected architecture firm Ayers Saint Gros, which also designed Ivory Tower, Potomac and Philip Amsterdam Hall.
The project, which will be funded through a combination of loans and donations, was outlined in the 2007 Campus Plan but will have to go through the city’s zoning process for a second approval. University officials must also present the project to the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, a local government body that acts as a liason between the community and city agencies.
But when construction crews gut the insides of Crawford, Schenley and The West End, the University will have to find space to house about 550 students who would have lived in those halls. The superdorm project must also be completed by 2016, when the lease expires for the junior and senior building City Hall, Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said.
He said the University has “some extra capacity” to account for the housing crunch during superdorm construction, but declined to say specifically where those hundreds of students would be placed.
University spokeswoman Jill Sankey said GW is still “exploring all options to best accommodate” the displaced students.
“The majority of these students will be housed in other on campus locations during the transition,” Sankey said.
About 30 feet of the historic facades of Crawford, Schenley and West End, built in the 1920s, will be preserved in the construction process, similar to Lafayette Hall renovations in 2010 that maintained a brick exterior while revamping the apartments inside.

Students will be able to rack up points for free meals at J Street starting this month.
GW is one of a dozen schools with Sodexo dining that will offer student customers rewards through a smartphone app called QBOT, designed to list coupons and alerts about sales.
Director of Campus Support Services Nancy Haaga said the deals program will encourage students to go to J Street and Pelham Commons on the Mount Vernon Campus. Students can download the iPhone and Android app to see daily sales and sign up for the loyalty program that offers students with coupons the more they shop.
“Hopefully, everyone wins. It will keep people coming back and it rewards customers with discounts and freebies,” Haaga said, adding that specifics like the types of sales and coupons have yet to be finalized.
The dining office has tried to reinvent J Street’s image through a major marketing campaign that launched last May, plastering advertisements in residence halls and trying to increase its social media presence. GW’s dining services welcomed its first marketing director in August.
J Street, which brought in Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and the Vietnamese option Bon Mi this year, has repeatedly swapped venues over the last two years to attract more business. After the removal of popular fast food options, like Chick-fil-A and Wendy’s, for Sodexo-run venues in 2011, sales dropped 25 percent. University spokespeople have since declined to release sales information.
Freshmen are required to spend $1,400 a year at J Street. Until last fall, sophomores were also given mandatory Dining Dollars.
Fordham University, Loyola University Maryland and the University of Denver were also picked to pilot Sodexo’s coupon and rewards program.
“We feel like it will be particularly important to have it at a school like GW, especially because it is so retail focused,” Haaga said. “For that reason, we thought we’d be an excellent fit, and they thought the same.”
Smartphone app QBOT’s Chief Technology Officer Kyle Phillips said Sodexo invited GW to participate because of its unique meal plan, which charges per item rather than per swipe.
Chair of the Student Dining Board Michael Morgan said his group is working on creating a GW-specific deals program and website, similar to Groupon and LivingSocial, for Sodexo-run venues and GWorld partners around Foggy Bottom.
Across the District, 417 shops and restaurants accept GWorld. Morgan said he hopes to get students out of “the Foggy Bottom bubble.”
On the QBOT plan, Morgan said it would benefit freshmen the most, because many eat multiple meals each day at J Street on their required $700-a-semester Dining Dollars plan.
“It will reward them for their loyalty and make them appreciate coming here,” Morgan said.

The President Condominium, the only non-GW building along a chunk of I Street, has for 71 years watched the University spend hundreds of millions of dollars razing and erecting new buildings. But owners and residents there say tensions with University construction have reached a tipping point.
As the University prepares to seek approval from the city’s zoning board Nov. 15 for its next big project – a multi-million dollar office complex along I Street and Pennsylvania Avenue – residents at the condominium say it could collapse their company and push tenants out of Foggy Bottom. They plan to testify against the project at a city hearing next month.
The proposed design is about 18 percent bigger than original plans laid out in the 2007 Campus Plan – a gripe residents plan to bring to the city. The 11-story structure would total 250,000 square feet, and also include 6,000 feet of retail, a loading dock and a 179-car garage.
Construction would begin in 2014, ripping down an office building, two University townhouses, Froggy Bottom Pub, Thai Place, Panda Cafe and Mehran Restaurant along Pennsylvania Avenue.
The condos, on the corner of 22nd and I streets, are also less than a block away from the construction pit that will become the Science and Engineering Hall in 2015, and the recently completed Avenue complex.
Anthony Cook, who has rented out space in The President Condominium for a decade, said noise and traffic from a proposed alleyway outside residents’ windows would turn them away for good.
“My tenants will move out. There’s no doubt in my mind,” Cook said at a Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting Wednesday. “There will be too much noise, too much traffic. The air won’t be clean. It won’t be healthy.”
A lawyer for the condominium, Martin Sullivan, said residents will air their concerns at the zoning hearing and try to halt approval unless GW “proposes some suitable mitigation measure.” He said they are waiting for a serious offer from the University to cut down on the alley’s immediate impacts to the condos, including sound and traffic.
“Rarely does a project have such a concentrated impact on one property,” Sullivan said.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said the University has discussed the project with community members – including representatives from the condos – for a year, and would continue “with a goal of addressing concerns as best as possible” before next month’s zoning hearing.
Jeff Barber, a University architect working on the project site, said the new building would be 10 feet farther away from The President than the existing structure. But he said the alley would need to be widened to 24 feet to accommodate traffic flow and loading needs.
The University will not calculate project costs until after the zoning process, Sherrard said. GW will add 40,000 square feet of affordable housing on F Street to compensate for the complex’s increased space.
Asher Corson, an alumnus and commissioner on the local group, called for the University to provide community amenities in exchange for the expanded property plan.
“It provides no direct amenity or benefit to the people who are going to be living near the site that will be impacted by it,” Corson said.
The group’s chair, Florence Harmon, said the University and Foggy Bottom neighbors would have a “philosophical difference of opinion” regarding the project, and it would be in the hands of the D.C. Zoning Commission to work out a solution.
“I think you all are going to take the position that the retail and the affordable housing will be enough for amenities,” Harmon said to the University officials at the meeting. “I think we will take a different position.”
Harmon was set to present a proposed list of amenities, gathered with community input, at Wednesday’s meeting. But when Corson said he had not yet seen the proposal, Harmon slammed her gavel down and ended the meeting early, before running through its full agenda.
Corson, who unwaveringly opposed the project during the University’s initial presentation on its plan last November, said moving the alleyway further from the condos would be the best solution to tone down the noise.
He also suggested that GW add a park near the space and donate to community organizations to give back to the neighborhood in return for additional space.

Thousands of students and their families gathered Saturday to see three-time Grammy award-winning band Train rock out for two hours at the Smith Center.
Crowds swayed to songs like “Calling All Angels” and jumped to their feet for upbeat tunes like “50 Ways to Say Goodbye” and “Hey Soul Sister.”
Lead singer Pat Monahan grabbed the audience’s attention throughout the show, ripping off his T-shirt at one point to autograph it and handing off the scraps to audience members. As beach balls flew overhead, he caught and signed a few before tossing them back into the crowd.
Between songs, Monahan cracked jokes with the crowd.
“Thank you for inviting us to such a beautiful school. We play a lot of schools that just party, but you 
actually do work here,” said Monahan, as he pretended to smoke a joint.
He also called about 20 females – students and family members – onto the stage to sing and dance during the song “Mermaid,” encouraging women over the age 18 to “sexy dance” for the crowd, and for the younger girls to “not even think about it.”
One freshman who made it onto the stage, Sara Wagner, said the experience was surreal.
“It was one of my favorite songs. It was so exciting,” she said. “There was so much energy. I was in shock.”
Monahan also called Nick Lancia, whose older brother, Richard, goes to GW, onto the stage during the last song of the set to give him a guitar signed by the entire band. Monahan said they chose Lancia because his dance moves showed he was enjoying the show from his seat.
During an encore, Train played “California 37,” a track off their latest album released in January, along with the two-time Grammy award-winning hit that rocketed them to mainstream success, “Drops of Jupiter.”
Train marks a departure from the string of comedians who have headlined Colonials Weekend in recent years, including Bill Maher, Jimmy Fallon and Jon Stewart.
Most seats appeared to be filled at the Smith Center, though University spokeswoman Jill Sankey said last week there were “several hundred” tickets left. She declined to provide the specific number of unsold tickets.
Tickets ranged from $45 for an obstructed view to $110 for a close-up floor seat.
Freshman Brendan McDermott called the concert “incredible.”
“They were incredibly fun,” he said. “You could tell they cared about the music.”

In Ancient Greece, the term “idiot” referred to a person who was uninvolved in public life. It was a sign of ignorance and a lack of education.
But contemporary society has a new term for those who don’t vote or participate in public life – they’re called young people.
My experience obtaining an absentee ballot this year was arduous to say the least – I requested a form to be able to request another form so that I could then request my actual ballot.
But there are many students who aren’t even registered to vote.
Voters 18 to 19 years of age only made up 17 percent of the actual voting population in 2008, according to Project Vote, a nonpartisan organization geared toward empowering underrepresented portions of the electorate.
There’s no doubt registering to vote is a confusing process, especially for college students who live away from home.
Each state has a different set of requirements and hoops a citizen must jump through. And this undoubtedly turns away people who might have otherwise cast their ballot.
The Washington Post reported last week that, as compared to the 2008 election, 50% fewer voters ages 18 to 30 said they were closely following this election’s political news. Just 63 percent of those individuals said they would certainly vote – down from 72 percent four years ago, according to the article.
The University should play a greater role in registering students to vote and encouraging them to cast their ballots on Election Day.
Other colleges and universities have found clever ways to maximize voter turnout on their campuses.
Northwestern University launched an initiative in 2011 called UVote, which integrates the voter registration process into school-wide functions such as course registration and freshman orientation. DePaul University, Shenandoah University, Stanford University and Washington University in St. Louis have also joined in on the initiative.
It’s something the University should look into.
While GW is not your average political landscape, it is important that the University ensures that as many of its students are registered as possible. GW already has a relatively elaborate freshman orientation program. During the two to three days students are on campus, the University could use a program like UVote to encourage eligible students to register to vote.
Citizenship is clearly important to the University, or else they would not have included it as a tenet of the 10-year strategic plan draft released earlier this month.
“The ways in which individuals and organizations relate to the communities in which they reside help define democratic society.”
We assume that because of the high number of political science majors and the University’s location in D.C., everyone on campus is a political wonk and frothing at the mouth to cast a ballot Nov. 6. But we shouldn’t.
The Greeks weren’t right about everything. Even philosophers like Plato and Aristotle thought the Earth was the center of the universe.
But at least they knew an idiot when they saw one.

An award-winning actress, the House majority leader, an NBA star and HIV/AIDS activist and the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts are among the candidates for honorary degrees this spring, the Board of Trustees decided Friday.
University President Steven Knapp will select recipients of ceremonial degrees during this spring’s Commencement from a candidate pool that includes Meryl Streep, Magic Johnson, Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Carmen Ortiz.
Recipients must meet two out of three criteria: a connection to GW, a commitment to public service and distinguished professional, intellectual, academic or creative success.
Last fall, the Board approved a list of 14 potential degree recipients, including author J.K. Rowling and Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh. Knapp ultimately selected international businessman Carlos Slim and alumna and artist Clarice Smith for the degrees, along with Commencement speaker and NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams.
Chairman of the board Russell Ramsey, who announced the candidates at a meeting Friday, lauded Streep for “vigorously supporting the arts.” The actress has picked up 17 Academy Award and 26 Golden Globe nominations ­– the most in the history for each award.
Johnson, an HIV-positive activist and the former point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers, came to campus last month for the annual Celebration of Science. Ramsey said Johnson expressed interest in the business schools’ master’s program for professional athletes.
Eric Cantor, who earned his bachelor’s degree in 1985, is the highest-ranking alumnus in Congress, Ramsey said. The Republican, who faces re-election this fall, is also the top-seated Jewish member of any Congress in history.
Ortiz, a 1981 law school graduate, is Boston’s first woman and first Hispanic to serve as U.S. Attorney. She landed the Bostonian of the year nod in 2012 for tackling white-collar crime and corruption throughout the city.
In past years, honorary degree candidates like first lady Michelle Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and civil rights activist Julian Bond were also invited to keynote Commencement.
Nominations come from faculty and students and are vetted by the Faculty Senate.

A new cafe will bring a Parisian twist to The Shops at 2000 Penn next month.
The old-fashioned French eatery PAUL Bakery will move into Foggy Bottom Nov. 15, the company’s president and CEO Philippe Sanchez said last week.
The cafe, known for its pastries, crepes and sandwiches, will seat nearly 80 customers, becoming the largest of its District locations.
The restaurant will open up at the corner of 20th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, across from Founding Farmers. Sanchez said the bakery is in talks with the city to open an outdoor seating area by the spring.
Sanchez said the eatery would accept GWorld shortly after opening. University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said GW is “working toward” making the bakery a GWorld partner.
First launched more than a century ago in Croix, France, about 140 miles north of Paris, the restaurant operates in more than 20 countries. It recreates the atmosphere of its Northern France location, displaying antiques and artwork.
“It will be a warm and welcoming environment where you feel like you’re transported to another country,” Sanchez said.
The PAUL company opened its flagship U.S. location in the District last spring and plans to put “a lot of money” into the Foggy Bottom location, Sanchez said, but he could not provide specific numbers.
The bakery can also be found in Penn Quarter, Georgetown and Farragut Square.
The bakery joins seven other eateries in 2000 Penn. Margaret Fisher, associate manager of the Au Bon Pain there, said she does not expect PAUL Bakery’s arrival to impact her business.
“It’s going to hurt at first, but kids are familiar with our specials, so they’ll come back in here,” she said.

When students taking online courses turn in assignments, professors often are left to guess about who is really submitting the work – a potential hole in the University’s efforts to curb cheating, the academic integrity chief said.
GW does not have safeguards in place to prevent online cheating and such cases make up a small portion of academic integrity violations, but as online offerings increase and the stakes rise, administrators are laying out a plan to prevent the behavior before it spreads, director of the Office of Academic Integrity Tim Terpstra said.
This semester, Terpstra’s office already has ruled on a handful of cases involveing students away from D.C. in online courses, making him think that the University isn’t catching enough of these students and that cases are underreported. Of the 145 academic integrity violations last year, about 5 percent came from online courses.
“I thought to myself, ‘Jeez, how do we know who’s taking care of this?’” Terpstra said, adding, “In the online realm, it’s just that much easier for [cheating] to happen.”
He said he has considered ideas like requiring students who take online courses – mostly graduate students – to take academic integrity seminars on campus, and adding training for professors to catch plagiarism. Terpstra also suggested adapting technology that would measure student keystroke patterns to confirm their identities, but he said because the technology isn’t polished, it would likely be years before those tools could be used.
“It’s one of my goals to come up with something to say, ‘Here’s what we do now for online courses.’ It’s not going to be perfect at this point, but it’s a lot better than looking the other way,” Terpstra said, adding that he wanted GW to be ahead of the curve on dealing with the mounting issue of academic integrity online.
The call for a preventative strategy comes after a proliferation of online academic classes and programs, which enable the University to slide in more tuition dollars under the city-regulated enrollment cap that limits the number of students enrolled on the Foggy Bottom Campus.
Administrators have touted online programs’ capability of reaching students across the world.
“I see it as another area of higher education where we’re going to have to deliver on this. We’re going to have to do something to ensure the integrity of the product,” Terpstra said.
Sheryl Elliott, who teaches several online tourism studies courses, said she has not run into academic integrity issues in her classes. She said her program’s on-campus components help curtail potential violations.
“The on-campus residencies are also the opportunity to go over policies on academic integrity. This would tend to prevent the situation at Rochville University where a dog was ostensibly awarded an MBA,” she said, referring to the unaccredited online university.
Another professor teaching an online course, Blaine Parrish, said he’s never found a student violating the academic integrity code in his courses because he relies on critical thinking assignments instead of multiple choice tests.
He added that by “individualizing the assignments,” students are less tempted to cheat.
The potential for cheating in online programs has come under a spotlight with the rise of massive open online courses, or MOOCs. Students in non-credit courses offered by Coursera reported dozens of plagiarism cases in August, pushing online learning companies to find a solution.
Professors can also ensure their online courses’ academic integrity through more video chats and threaded discussions, Teresa Fishman, director of the International Institute for Academic Integrity, said.
She said various universities and programs use a range of techniques to fight cheating and plagiarism, from identity verification systems to in-person proctored exams, so there’s not one accepted method yet.
“Teachers need to understand that this is a problem and take a combination of steps so that the students are given the right credit. We don’t want online courses to be devalued, because the opportunities are expanding,” she said.
