Graduate student guard Brendan Adams nailed a three off the dribble to capture a 3-point advantage, setting up a single-handed scoring surge from senior guard James Bishop that would lock up a victory for the Colonials.
GW defeated Davidson by a narrow 75-70 margin Wednesday night in a late-game comeback surge led by senior guard James Bishop.
The Colonials trailed by single digits for the majority of the matchup, never going down by more than 9, and pulling out in front 12 minutes into the second half. Bishop, who scored 9 of his 26 points in the final four minutes, led the decisive offensive burst, propelling GW to their fourth-straight win and moving them to seventh place in the A-10.
The Colonials struggled to score consistently in the first half, going 0-8 from beyond the arc and shooting just .379 percent from the field. But the defense held their own before halftime, keeping the Wildcats to .400 percent shooting and winning the rebound battle 35-34.
The first five minutes of play featured lackluster offensive production from both sides, with only five made shots from the floor enabling a 5-4 Davidson advantage. Six minutes in, the Wildcats pushed their early lead to 13-6 off a wing three by redshirt junior forward Sam Mennega.
Mennega led the way for Davidson with 23 points and eight boards on a night when the GW defense held their leading scorer senior guard Foster Loyer to a .300 percent clip from the field on six of 20 shooting. 
With eight to play, the Wildcats still couldn’t manage to build a lead beyond two scores despite a four-minute GW scoring drought. Senior forward Hunter Dean brought the Davidson lead back down to 3 after converting an and-one on a high key jumper with 7:44 remaining.
Dean continued his recent hot streak from last game, coming up just one rebound shy of a double-double with 11 points in 33 minutes of play. His performance followed a career-high scoring night Saturday with 21 points in the victory over La Salle.
Davidson went on to spark the only major offensive push of the first half, cobbling together a 13-8 run to give them their largest advantage yet, up 32-24 with just under two to go. Senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. softened the blow with a hard dunk on the other end to bring the Colonials two points closer as it went to halftime.
Lindo managed to hold down the painted area all game, pulling down a game-high 11 rebounds in addition to a block and a steal, to anchor the Colonials defense.
The second half started with a trey from redshirt freshman guard Maximus Edwards that cut the lead to three at 32-29. Scoring started to accelerate for the Wildcats as they headed toward their largest lead of the night with another 13-8 run that put them up 9 by a score of 46-37 with 15:46 to play.
Edwards played an efficient game offensively, logging a heavy 38 minutes. He only fired seven shots and connected on four of them for a 10-point total.
Bishop responded to the Davidson hot streak with a second-chance jumper on the other end. The next possession, a fastbreak score from graduate guard Brendan Adams brought GW to within five just a minute after the Davidson run concluded. 
The score continued to narrow before Dean tied up the game at 48 with 11:19 to play after an inside score off the assist from Bishop. The scoring burst from both sides slowed from there, and the game remained close, with the score deadlocking again at 57 with 5:22 to play.
Adams nailed a 3 off the dribble to capture a 3-point advantage, setting up a single-handed scoring surge from Bishop that would lock up a victory for the Colonials. Starting with a deep 3 of his own with 3:14 to play, Bishop strung together four straight GW buckets, culminating in two free throws that gave GW a 6-point advantage with just under a minute to play to close out the game.
The Colonials offense came together when it counted, defying a shaky first half to pull off a consequential win that places them sixth in the ever-shifting A-10 standings. With just one game remaining before the tournament, the Colonials are locked into the top 7, ensuring a first-round bye.
The final regular season game will take place at the Smith Center against VCU at 4:30 p.m. Saturday.

Senior guard Nya Lok lit up the scoreboard in the second half, shooting 7-8 from the field in the back 20 minutes while on her way to a 20-point total.
A heroic shot with five seconds remaining from graduate student guard Mia Lakstigala pushed women’s basketball past Duquesne in the second round of the Atlantic 10 tournament Thursday evening, securing a spot in the quarterfinals for the Colonials.
The Colonials defeated the Dukes 71-68 in the Chase Fieldhouse in Wilmington, Delaware, led by a 24-point performance from Lakstigala, whose game-winning, 3-point dagger sealed GW’s victory after a nailbiter. GW now advances to face second-seeded Rhode Island Friday at 5 p.m. in the quarterfinals.
Lakstigala’s game-winning shot came off of redshirt senior forward Mayowa Taiwo’s sixth offensive rebound of the game. Lakstigala said she knew GW had a chance at victory when Taiwo kicked the ball to her at the wing from below the rim with less than 10 seconds left.
“I’m just really proud of her, that she was able to get that last one,” Lakstigala said after the game. “And when she kicked it out, I knew the time was running down, so all I had to do was shoot it.”
Lakstigala nailed the jumper with just 4.9 seconds left, sending the GW bench into jubilant chaos. Taiwo – who played all 40 minutes of the game – blocked a last-second Duquesne 3-point attempt, and Lakstigala secured the rebound feet away. The hero of the game ended with the ball in her hands and sprinted to the GW bench to celebrate their advancement to the quarterfinals.
Head Coach Caroline McCombs said controlling the boards and maintaining possessions against the well-shooting Dukes was a main focus of the team.
“We knew we needed to rebound,” McCombs said after the game. “We knew we needed to be the tougher team. And I’m just really proud again of our resilience.”
Senior guard Nya Lok bolstered GW’s performance in the second half, lighting up the scoreboard with 17 points and shooting 7-8 from the field in the back 20 minutes. Lok scored 20 throughout the whole affair paired with eight rebounds, ailing Duquesne throughout the second half.
Lakstigala opened the scoring 45 seconds into the game with a 3-pointer off a pass by junior guard Asjah Inniss, the first of her six made shots from behind the arc. In what could have been her final collegiate game, the star scored 24 to go along with nine rebounds.
“They did a really good job of finding me for those open shots,” Lakstigala said of her dominant game. “I think when we play well together, the game just comes naturally.”
The game soon became a back-and-forth affair, with Duquesne knocking down two consecutive corner 3s in the third minute of the game, including one by star sophomore guard Megan McConnell, a member of the second team All A-10. McConnell scored 17 on the night alongside eight rebounds and eight assists.
Lakstigala’s 10 first-quarter points bolstered GW’s offense and pushed the Colonials to a 16-11 lead with three minutes to go. But four consecutive GW turnovers, including three straight travels, allowed Duquesne to momentarily jump out to a 1-point lead before a layup by Inniss pushed GW back in front.
GW was able to remain in the driver’s seat for the rest of the first half – never ceding the lead and holding Duquesne to only 14 points in the second quarter, entering the break up 36-33.
Freshman guard Nya Robertson – the A-10’s Sixth Woman of the Year – struggled off the bench, particularly in the second quarter, where she went only one for five. Robertson, the team’s highest scorer this year with 14.5 points per game, finished the duel with 7 points, making three of her 13 attempts.
The teams traded barbs in the first five minutes of the second half, and a 3-pointer from Duquesne sophomore guard Naelle Bernard tied the game at 43. But Lakstigala and Lok shot back, making consecutive treys and sparking a 12-3 GW run.
“When it comes to March Madness, you just need to be the tougher team,” Lok said.
Both teams were solid from 3-point range – the Dukes sank nine of their 22 attempts, while GW made 10 of 23. The Colonials held Duquesne sophomore guard Tess Myers – who was sixth in the NCAA in 3-point attempts with an impressive 38 percent shooting percentage – to only three shots from deep.
GW entered the final quarter with a 9-point lead, but a flurry of Duquesne shots cut the margin to just 1 with 7:40 left in the game. Both teams quieted down for the next three minutes, but the Dukes nabbed a 64-62 lead with 4:17 left, Duquesne’s first advantage since the first quarter.
The teams ping-ponged for the next three minutes, and a Lok layup with 56 seconds remaining tied the game at 68. Duquesne failed to score in the last 2:52, missing all four of their attempts.
After a Duquesne jumper flew out of bounds following a scrap for the rebound, officials reviewed to see who touched the ball last and granted possession to GW.
With 11 seconds left, a layup from Asjah Inniss bounced off the far side of the rim, right to the waiting Taiwo. Taiwo leaped over a misplaced Duke rebounder and kicked the ball out to Lakstigala at the wing with seven seconds remaining.
Bang.
Lakstigala’s instinctual shot nestled through the hoop with 4.9 seconds left, and Duquesne called timeout.
“I just had the confidence in my shot,” she said.
Duquesne inbounded the ball from half-court on their last possession, but Taiwo blocked a final 3-point attempt from Myers at the wing. Lakstigala dribbled out the remaining seconds across midcourt before a Duke could foul her.
GW faces Rhode Island Friday, a rematch of the Rams’ 64-47 drubbing of GW last month. Rhode Island finished 14-2 in the A-10, with Head Coach Tammi Reiss earning the nod as A-10 Coach of the Year and junior forward Mayé Touré winning the A-10’s Most Improved Player award.
The Colonials face off against no. 2 seed Rhode Island Friday at 5 p.m. in Wilmington, Delaware, in the quarterfinals of the A-10 tournament.

Residents of Shenkman, Thurston and West halls will continue to use electronic mail lockers in the lobbies of their buildings as officials add electronic systems to residence halls across campus, according to the email.
Officials announced a campus-wide transition to self-servicing electronic mail and package service pickup in an email Thursday, slotting the installation of new mail lockers in residence halls for spring and summer.
Officials will implement 24-hour mail and package lockers in JBKO Hall during spring break and in District House and Mitchell, Amsterdam, Guthridge and South halls during the summer, some of which will hold mail for neighboring halls without lockers, the email states. The email states officials are expanding the electronic locker system for mail and package, phasing out the existing mail and package service system after officials noticed a “huge increase” in package deliveries and a decline in postal mail.
Officials said JBKO Hall will service Munson and Fulbright halls, District House’s lockers will serve residents of Lafayette Hall, Amsterdam will service Madison Hall residents, Guthridge will serve 2109 F Street and Mitchell hall lockers will hold mail for 1959 E Street residents. 
Residents of Shenkman, Thurston and West halls will continue to use preexisting electronic mail lockers in the lobbies of their buildings, according to the email.
“We set a goal to identify a way for you to pick-up your packages closer to where you live rather than trekking across campus,” the email states. 
Under the existing system, Mail and Package Services receives student mail in their primary campus hub, the mailroom in the lower level of the Support Building on F Street. MPS then delivers postal mail to personal combination, lock and key mailboxes for all hall residents – except for those in Shenkman, Thurston and West halls, who can already access electronic lockers. Residents without the lockers must pick up packages from the Support Building after receiving an email PacTrac pickup notification.
The preexisting MPS buildings in Foggy Bottom and the Mount Vernon Campus will continue to be open throughout the summer and next year and will receive packages that are too large to fit in the new electronic lockers, according to the email. The email states officials will remove older mailboxes in the buildings upon installing the new lockers.
The email states officials will install 24-hour kiosks in the lobbies of the buildings, which will receive mail and packages directly and send students a code to open the locker and access their mail upon deliveries.
The email states that officials are still reviewing mail and package services for those in townhouses, including The Dakota, International House, Building JJ and Francis Key Scott and Potomac halls, but that more information will come out this summer.
“As we get closer to installation dates, we’ll let the residents of that building know of upcoming work,” the email states. “We hope you like these lobby ‘makeovers’ that will provide you with more convenient ways to pick-up your mail and packages.”
Officials first installed the electronic lockers in West Hall in 2018 and added the kiosks to Shenkman a year later. They installed new lockers in Thurston Hall during renovations of the building, reopening for use in fall 2022.
In November, students without access to electronic lockers said they faced difficulties accessing their mail, including receiving their election ballots to vote in the 2022 midterm elections. More than two dozen students said they received their ballots days before the election, after the election or never at all, leaving many with little time to cast their votes.

The menu had plenty of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike, with most dishes offering the choice of shrimp, beef, chicken or tofu.
A cross between a Thai restaurant and underground market combines a menu of bento boxes, curries and wontons with bountiful groceries including matcha, ramen and pocky sticks.
Rice sits across the street from D.C.’s iconic Le Diplomate in a narrow storefront, split into two levels between a minimalist urban restaurant on the main floor and an expansive grocery store downstairs. The idea for Rice stemmed from the childhood of owner Sak Pollert, who grew up on a rice farm in Thailand and sought to bring the country’s classic noodle, rice and soup dishes to the District.
Upon opening the rustic, wooden front door, patrons are presented with a choice: to head down a narrow, dimly lit staircase to the market below, or enter through a black set of curtains to the dining space on the main floor. Looking to explore a bit before our meal, my friend and I began the descent downward, where we came upon shelves of various Sake, infinite types of chili oil, bags of white rice and an assortment of different matcha.

Dry goods necessary for Asian food recipes line one side of the store, and fridges stocked full of fresh mochi, premade curries and spring rolls and frozen Gyoza stand on the opposite end. Hand-painted ceramic bowls, glasses and mugs decorated with flowers and colorful designs are available for purchase in the back. At a register counter in the center of the basement, a sushi chef slices fresh fish and packs them into beautiful stacked rolls. After wandering around and admiring the various goods offered we headed upstairs to dine at the restaurant.
On the entry-level floor, a large wooden bar runs along one side of the wall, offering a casual option for those who are unable to secure a spot at the eight small tables. Exposed brick, wooden panels, dried flowers and framed old newspapers contribute to the minimalist decor across the space. Besides the one front window, the only light comes from abstract chandeliers which provide a warm glow above the guests. Soft instrumental music fills the small space, rounding out a calming ambiance.

We arrived at 6:45 p.m. on a Wednesday and were seated immediately, tucked in within an arm’s length between us and another couple. We debated what to order from the dinner menu, featuring classic Thai items like pork green tea dumplings ($9), pad see eew ($16) and fried rice ($16). Per our waiter’s recommendation, we started with the crispy brussels sprouts salad ($9) as an appetizer. The fried brussels sprouts were a crunchy burst of tangy umami soy-lime flavoring, served on a bed of lettuce, and we devoured them in a few bites each.
After a tasty start to the meal, I ordered the drunken noodles with shrimp ($16), and my friend got the green curry with tofu ($16). The menu had plenty of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike, with most dishes offering the choice of shrimp, beef, chicken or tofu. Our food came minutes after we licked our appetizer plate clean, steam still rising from the large white plates and bowl.
The drunken noodles came with a generous serving of shrimp and an assortment of sliced vegetables like green and red peppers, onions, green beans and chiles. The vegetables contrasted the soft noodles with a surprising and satisfying crunch. Plentiful leaves of basil topped the chewy hand-made noodles and added a herbaceous note to the otherwise-spicy flavor profile. The noodles were flat and wide, folding onto each other almost like pieces of lasagna.
A spicy soy sauce laced with chili pepper coated the mix, leaving a burning but welcoming taste on my tongue. The onions added a nice sweetness to the savory sauce, and notes of garlic were present throughout the dish. The shrimp were sizeable and juicy, and with the noodles and veggies, they made for a perfectly balanced bite. The portion was ideal for one person but can easily be split between two people for a lighter meal.
Despite our pleasant fullness, we made a trip downstairs to snag some strawberry mochi. We stood outside the building, alternating bites as red bean filling oozed out of the shell. The outer layer of rice flour was pink, soft and chewy to bite into, with a subtle fruity flavor, holding together the sweet but slightly nutty red bean paste inside.
Rice has something for everyone – whether you are looking to pick up ingredients to cook at home, get a quick to-go lunch, or indulge in classic Thai dishes in a quaint environment.

Hollywood has a glistening reputation, renowned for its literal and figurative Walk of Fame. But Hollywood isn’t the only prominent city in the United States where stardom has captivated the country’s attention.
D.C. – which political commentator Paul Begala dubbed “Ugly Hollywood” in the 1980s – might not be as glamorous as Tinseltown, but it’s brimming with a similar vein of fame-seeking, self-righteous politicians and public figures that dulls the poignancy of real political policy and civil service.
Celebrity politicians, basking in all their Capitol Hill glory, toe the line between making politics accessible to the public and romanticizing the powers that be. Congress isn’t just the seat of the U.S. government – it signifies glory and name recognition for up-and-coming politicians. There’s a reason being a “Hilltern” – the nickname given to interns working on Capitol Hill – is a coveted position. For D.C. residents, it’s analogous to working under the Hollywood big-league producers. Like traditional red carpet celebrities, politicians mold their personalities around their campaigns and careers, which can elicit obsessive and unbalanced dynamics with constituencies.
Parasocial relationships, a term coined by psychologists Donald Horton and R. Richard Wahl in 1956, describes one-sided relationships between celebrities and their fans. When fans treat a public figure as their close friend or enemy, they invest their time and energy into a person who probably doesn’t know they exist. Because of how social media elevates politicians, constituents become enamored with their congressional representatives much like they would an influencer, musician or actor.
While psychologists are still unraveling the impact of parasocial relationships on politics, these relationships have proven to be a direct indicator of public sentiment for political elections and campaigns. A study conducted by University of Haifa professor Jonathan Cohen and Temple University professor R. Lance Holbert found that intense parasocial relationships denoted strong support for former President Donald Trump following his inauguration. Parasocial relationships also increased support for other political leaders like Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan, according to the study.
As politicians increase their presence on social media sites like TikTok to advertise their campaigns and policies, their personalities and public image become too closely intertwined with their policy and they limit the degree of separation between shallow, social media influencing and positive political impact.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, frequently jumps on Instagram Live to share everything from mundane details about her life, like making macaroni and cheese, to experiences with major political events, like her recollection of Jan. 6. Interacting with fans or antagonists in this manner creates an illusion of closeness – as if a public livestream is the same as a private FaceTime.
When supporters romanticize politicians and overly antagonize their opposition, the focus shifts from their policy rather than their personality. Articles focusing on Trump’s fiery Twitter comebacks and overall scandalous presidency limited the discussion of real issues, like environmental deregulation and his “zero tolerance” policy toward illegal border crossings. A Pew Research Center study found that more than two-thirds of examined news stories in 2017 about Trump were centered around his personality and leadership style instead of his policies and beliefs. Articles about Ocasio-Cortez’s “obsession-worthy Instagram” or how she “beats everyone at Twitter” repeat the same pattern.
The personalities of celebrities have supplanted their policies and ideologies, creating a one-track mind for their bases. Our politicians are no longer complex, multi-faceted human beings with a range of social and fiscal beliefs. They have become caricatures of themselves and their political stances.
No matter how far-right or far-left politicians come across, there are still complexities to their legislative decision-making processes. Issues like gun control and universal health care are quite literally life or death – and constituents should treat them as such. But due to the reputations these lawmakers have cultivated through social media, their stances become extensions of their assumed personas. From conservatives dubbing Ocasio-Cortez as a leftist extremist to liberals slamming Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-GA, as a right-wing conspiracist, polarized personas have fueled echo chambers of undiscerning political thought.
Celebrity politicians and the parasocial relationships they enable can negatively influence public perception and shape the future of how politicians communicate with their voters through a fraudulent sense of personalization. It takes an element of egoism for a politician to want to enter a career in front of an audience, and these politicians now find themselves in the same category as Hollywood influencers and A-list celebrities. We need to draw the line between civil servitude and celebrity status, recognizing when we as voters are falling into the traps of unrequited obsession.

Facing a problem yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
Dear Annie,
My dad and stepmom were supposed to visit me last month to celebrate my first birthday in college. My dad ended up coming by himself because my stepmom had a nail appointment she scheduled months in advance. How can I tell them she hurt my feelings without jeopardizing our relationship?
Help please,
Birthday Blues
Dear Birthday Blues,
Birthdays at college – especially your first one – are confusing. You have to balance your longing for familiar family traditions, like celebratory dinners, with the reality of being away from home. It is time to invest in a pair of big-boy pants to advocate for yourself. Disappointment is a natural part of any relationship – even (step) parent-child ones. Properly communicating your feelings can keep you from running away to join the Amish, as the melodramatic David Rose does in family sitcom Schitt’s Creek.
Jenna Baer | Cartoonist

Coordinate a specific time to talk with your stepmom so you both have ample time for a satisfying discussion. But make sure to taper your expectations for the conversation. In sharing your disappointment, ask her to be more sensitive to special days in your life instead of probing for an apology. A “sorry” will not fix her parenting limitations, but expressing a need for quality time may guide her behavior in the future.
Speak the simple truth – that scheduling a nail appointment on your birthday made you feel neglected. Use “I feel” statements instead of the more accusatory “you.” If you’re feeling vindictive, tell her how much fun you had with your dad on your birthday – quality time that she missed because of her own carelessness.
While I empathize with you, let’s consider what you would have done with your parents anyway if your stepmother joined your dad for your birthday. You might have had brunch while she pointed out passersby who look like they are on the walk of shame, or maybe you would have wandered around the National Gallery while she criticized a manicure in a priceless portrait. You deserve to spend your day surrounded by authentic, natural love as opposed to stiff activities with someone who prioritizes vanity over quality time.
Instead of waiting for your stepmother to follow in the footsteps of the world’s “schittiest” mother Moira Rose, who declares she is “positively bedeviled with meetings, et cetera,” on your birthday, celebrate with your friends ahead of time. With one fewer family member at your birthday meal, treat a close friend to dinner on your parent’s dime if you have the option.
When you travel from one community to the next – like home to college – it’s easy to resent those who aren’t there for you during the transition as they were in the past. But the frustration toward those in the past may prevent you from embracing those in the present. You’re a “grownup” now – leave the family behind, find your friends and have fun!
Warmest regards,
Annie<3

The Equity Institute currently provides seed funding to 31 projects on social justice, like a project on the impact of parental incarceration on children’s mental health, spearheaded by GW professors and staff and non-GW recipients, an increase from 10 projects last semester.
GW chartered an interdisciplinary, collaborative research institute working to address racial and ethnic inequality, according to a University release last week.
Officials granted an official charter – a legal document establishing the goals and structure of an organization – to the GW Institute for Racial, Ethnic and Socioeconomic Equity, a research institute aimed at supporting social science, engineering and law scholars researching worldwide inequality. The announcement follows the institute’s original launch in 2021, and officials will now begin the search for the institute’s inaugural executive director, according to the release.
“The institute’s establishment officially opens a new collaborative, interdisciplinary chapter for GW researchers addressing questions of racial and socioeconomic justice,” the release states.
Dayna Bowen Matthew, the dean of GW Law and the institute’s faculty director, said she hopes the charter will “mark GW’s commitment to justice” and establish the University as a resource for scholars, educational institutions and government entities engaged in policymaking.
“GW has dedicated its resources to support faculty and students who seek to improve societies near and far by contributing to the work of eradicating discrimination, bigotry, prejudice and inequality – to advancing the cause of justice, both here in the United States and around the world,” Matthew said in a release.
The Equity Institute currently provides seed funding to 31 projects on social justice, like a project on the impact of parental incarceration on children’s mental health, spearheaded by GW professors and staff and non-GW recipients, an increase from 10 projects last semester.
Kian Azimpoor, a third-year GW Law student, said pursuing a project on disparities in the criminal justice system in partnership with the Justice Innovation Lab – an institute-funded organization working to find solutions to inequalities in the criminal justice system – through the Selected Topics in Criminal Justice course allowed him to engage with “real-world problems,” like systemic racism in the legal system.
“In a way, it’s probably the most creative class I’ve ever taken – the kind of course that has the ability to help facilitate a new wave of innovative law students,” Azimpoor said in the release.
Saniya LeBlanc, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, said the institute’s funding for her project on how advancing technology can improve health care outcomes “catalyzed” her ability to create partnerships with other D.C. organizations.
“We are learning so much about the different perspectives, approaches and experiences across healthcare, energy infrastructure, transportation and education as our project team builds bridges between disciplines and organizations in D.C.,” LeBlanc said in the release.
The institute will host its annual Global Equity Workshops in the Milken Institute School of Public Health April 26, featuring a presentation titled “The Impact of Colonialism on Surgical Training Structures on Africa,” according to the release.

The Joint Elections Commission internally approved its calendar in its Feb. 17 meeting, which would set the election for April 5 and 6.
The Student Association Senate unanimously passed legislation during its meeting Monday pushing back the date of their upcoming elections and encouraging more transparency from the University about how student tuition and fees are spent.
The Election Timeline Amendment Act of 2023 allows for more flexibility for the date SA elections are held, removing the March 31 election deadline if the Joint Elections Commission provides an acceptable reason for the delay. The amendment states elections must be held within 14 days of the previous March 31 deadline to ensure newly elected SA officials have time to transition into their positions.
The Joint Elections Commission internally approved its calendar in its Feb. 17 meeting, which would set the election for April 5 and 6.
Senate chairperson pro tempore Demetrius Apostolis, CCAS-U, said the need to push back the date of the election came from delays in appointing JEC commissioners to oversee the election.
“We believe that this resolution strikes the right balance between ensuring the integrity of the elections process and accommodating unforeseen circumstances that may arise,” Apostolis said.
The Funding Transparency Act calls on the University to establish a database disclosing which organizations, both for-profit and nonprofit, donate more than $50,000 to the University. SA Sen. Rami Hanash Jr., GWSB-U and sponsor of the resolution, said the legislation will provide students with a better understanding of the University’s “financial interests.”
“Students will need to have a better understanding of where their money is going and whether it is being used in ways that align with their values and priorities,” Hanash said.
The Board of Trustees is looking to increase the University’s donor network, focusing on alumni outreach and increasing donations from existing donors. Earlier in the semester, 14 student organizations and seven professors formed a “coalition” calling on the University to publicly disclose its funding.
The Senate unanimously approved freshman Joe Caltagirone as assistant legislator general.
SA Sen. Linsi Goodin, CCAS-G and chair of the finance committee, said the general allocations process for the fall 2023 semester is set to open March 1 and close March 20. Student organizations will have the opportunity to request funding from the SA during this period.
The finance committee held a series of four information sessions for student organization leaders about the allocations process works and changes made to make the process more accessible, like allowing requests for category funding instead of line items. Legislative Budget Officer Nathan Nguyen said the finance committee is hopeful the allocations process will be more successful after the information sessions and feedback from student organizations.
Goodin said the University-Wide Program Fund is out of money for the rest of the academic year. The University-Wide Program Fund serves as a combined fund between the SA and the University, and a joint committee allocates funds for multicultural and campus-wide events.
SA Sen. Gabriel Young, CCAS-U, said he was concerned the committee did not plan for multicultural event funding needs later in the semester. Young, who also serves as president for the Philippine Culture Society, said there is no money left in the fund for celebrations of Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage month, which occur in May.
“I reached out to Vice President Xu asking about how the process was for UWPF, and Vice President Xu told me that there was no money left in the UWPF,” he said. “And so that was disheartening to hear.”
SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, LAW-G, said the Student Bar Association is concerned about how the University-Wide Program Fund benefits law students, as few events held by law school student organizations meet the requirements to use the fund.
“There was no communication to the SBA on what type of programming the fund was being used that students from law school could end up being a part of,” Ingraham said.
Apostolis said the Governing Documents Committee reviewed and approved the SA Constitution. The Senate will have the opportunity to review the document and suggest revisions.
Apostolis also said the governance and nominations committee will be conducting interviews to fill eight vacancies in the senate this weekend.
SA Vice President Yan Xu said the University is in good financial standing after he attended a Faculty Senate budgeting and fiscal planning meeting.
Xu said he and SA Sen. Amy Cowley, ESIA-G, are planning to survey the conditions of spaces for students who are parents. Xu said he hopes the SA can collaborate with graduate student organizations to address the quality of the spaces.
Xu said the SA is currently researching whether or not the University is complying with a D.C. law, mandating universities provide menstrual products in bathrooms.
SA President Christian Zidouemba said he is advocating for the financial aid website to make its information available in Spanish. Zidouemba said he is assembling a task force to address this initiative, working with students who brought the problem to his attention.
“Anybody who wants to be able to access those websites should be able to do so in their own language,” Zidouemba said.
SA Sen Nicole Blackstone, G-At-Large, expressed concern over Zidouemba’s appointment of Sinan Kassim as director of external relations, which did not require senate approval. The SA in January rejected Zidoumba’s appointment of Kassim to be executive secretary of community and government relations.
The next SA Senate meeting will be held March 6 at 8:30 p.m. in the University Student Center’s Continental Ballroom.

Officials have inspected 7000-series train wheels every seven days since Jan. 28, when WMATA kicked off Phase 3 of the Return to Service Plan that was approved in October.
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority officials are altering the way they press wheels on its 7000-series rail cars in a multiyear plan that is estimated to cost tens of millions of dollars.
WMATA officials announced in a press release Tuesday they are creating plans to change how they reassemble defect wheels on its 7000-series rail cars discovered in inspection checks. The release states the plan will cost approximately $55 million and that officials will fix the wheel pressing on 20 cars per month, aiming to finish improvements on all 748 cars after three years.
The release came in response to a 1400-page National Transportation Safety Board report providing operational, mechanical and engineering railcar data, including information about the cause of a Blue Line train derailment near Arlington Cemetery in October 2021, sparking officials to temporarily pull all 7000-series trains from operation.
The report states 7000-series railcar wheels “microslip” off train axles because of a lack of pressure between the trains and the track. WMATA engineers believe an increase to the fit and press of the wheels mounted onto the axles of the 7000-series rail cars is an effective method to repair the railcars, according to the release.
“Process changes must be safe and deliberate,” WMATA Chief of Safety and Readiness Theresa Impastato said in the release. “We will take the time needed to get this right because every single rail car must undergo a rigorous process to be ready to serve our customers and support our employees.”
WMATA officials will submit their plan for changes in how the wheels are pressed to the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, according to the release. The release did not specify when WMATA will submit its plan.
“We appreciate the NTSB making the technical reports available so that we can develop our plan to begin repressing wheels on these trains at a higher standard, including the fit onto the axles,” WMATA Chief Operations Officer Brian Dwyer said in the release.
Officials returned eight 7000-series trains to circulation last June in Phase 1 of the WMATA’s Return to Service Plan and 12 more in September in Phase 2 following the derailment. All trains were allowed in circulation starting in October after approval from WMSC.
WMSC officials responded to the return of 7000-series trains by increasing wait time for Blue, Orange and Silver line trains from 15 to 25 minutes for a week on Jan. 13, citing concerns with train operator training and inspections. WMATA officials successfully appealed the decision on the same day, and the trains continued to run every 15 minutes.
Officials have inspected 7000-series train wheels every seven days since Jan. 28, when WMATA kicked off Phase 3 of the Return to Service Plan that was approved in October. The WSMC temporarily paused the Phase 3 transition in early January, which would’ve increased train wait time to 25 minutes, before reversing their plan later that week and allowing the rollout to continue.
Previously, officials inspected 7000-series wheels for defects every four days during Phase 2, which spanned from September to January, and inspected them every day during Phase 1, which spanned from June to September.
Metro riders experienced delays of up to 30 minutes before officials returned eight 7000-series trains to service in June, as they account for 60 percent of WMATA’s total railcars. The delays came as the opening of the Silver Line extension to Dulles International Airport and Loudoun County continued to be pushed back because of construction issues, opening in November – four years behind schedule.
WMATA announced in March 2021 that it agreed to a contract with Hitachi Rail to purchase up to 800 8000-series cars for $2.2 billion, which may arrive on Metro lines by 2025. The 8000-series trains will have heated floors and considerations are being made for open gangways between cars.
WMATA purchased the 7000-series rail cars from Japanese company Kawasaki between 2010 and 2013 because they had “better” door, signage and camera technology, replacing their current 1000-series railcar fleet at the time, according to then-Metro General Manager Richard Sarles in a September 2013 statement to the WMATA Board of Directors.

NPS spokesperson Mike Litterst said in an email last week that warmer temperatures “break” winter dormancy in flowering trees like the cherry trees along the Tidal Basin.
The National Park Services predict D.C.’s cherry trees will reach peak bloom between March 22 and March 25, which could be the second-earliest bloom since 2013.
The NPS recorded visible florets – the second stage in trees’ spring bloom – on more than 70 percent of the trees around the Tidal Basin, the earliest since 2017. Since 1921, D.C.’s cherry trees along the Tidal Basin have typically reached peak bloom on April 4, but blooms have come early in 16 of the last 20 years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
NPS spokesperson Mike Litterst said in an email last week that warmer temperatures “break” winter dormancy in flowering trees like the cherry trees along the Tidal Basin. He said the warmer temperatures signal the chance for an early bloom.
“The cherry trees have progressed to florets visible, the 2nd of 6 stages,” NPS said in a Wednesday tweet. “Depending on the weather, peak bloom should be around 3 weeks away!”
In 1909, Japanese chemist Jokichi Takamine and Tokyo Mayor Yukio Ozaki gave more than 2,000 cherry trees after federal officials expressed interest in planting cherry trees around D.C. In 1910, however, the Department of Agriculture found the trees were infested with insects and disease so the department burned them down.
Ozaki requested the Japanese government make a second donation of disease-free trees to the United States, and more than 3,000 trees arrived in 1912. The planting of the trees lasted until 1920 and took place along the Tidal Basin and on White House grounds.
