When the University first sent us home in March of last year, I knew my girlfriend and I would likely not be able to see each other until maybe the summer. But as cases soared and COVID anxiety weighed heavier, summer turned into fall and fall into winter. Before I knew it, we were nearly a year into our relationship with just four months having been spent in person. 
Entering lockdown and isolation while in a new relationship was not easy. As we were each trying to maneuver the pandemic, Zoom classes, internships and generally living back at home with family, we were still trying to get to know each other and learn who we were as a couple. Our relationship was tested in every possible way. At one point, we even had to take a short break because of mental illness and the stress of quarantine.
But what helped us hold onto our relationship was not just love or sheer willpower – it was communication. 
It’s a cliché to say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, in our case, it did – but it didn’t do so on its own. When the only way for you to be with your partner is through phone or computer screens, it is absolutely necessary that you learn to communicate with them. It takes a lot of work, vulnerability, tears, time, understanding and constant conversation. For us, it looked like sharing every part of our days, telling stories about funny things someone said in class, calling during meal times, virtual picnics and simultaneously watching movies over a computer screen together.
Wanting to be with someone can only get you so far – especially during a pandemic. You have to put in the legwork, show up every day and show your significant other that you are in this relationship to win it even when it seems like the world is ending. If you would not be able to last nine months or a year apart, you have to ask yourself the serious question of why you are in this relationship in the first place. And for the sake of communication, you need to ask your partner that, too.
We are now in the same city and only 15 minutes away from each other, but our relationship still carries the weight that almost nine months apart leaves you with. We feel the uncertainty about the future, fear of the ever-present pandemic and a complete gratitude for every second we get to spend together. And for every rough patch, we have learned to talk it out and navigate it together.
College relationships are sometimes looked down upon or scoffed at, especially when people our age are so young and entering such a variable economy. But during an especially uncertain time, I do know one thing – our relationship was made stronger from our time apart and will grow even stronger from our time together. All it takes is communication.

Let’s face it, 2020 was a lonely year. And for college-aged kids like us, we’re in desperate need of human connection– Gen Z was reportedly the loneliest demographic in 2020.
Being separated from friends and family was not most people’s first choice for the roaring ’20s, but this isolation, compounded with being single on Valentine’s Day, is a new type of loneliness. We want to go out more than ever, pandemic aside. But for the sake of safety, please fight the urge to go out for a date or hookup this Valentine’s Day. Instead of heading outside of your bubble, find a way to treat yourself or meet new people virtually.
For starters, you could open up Omegle, an online chat service that chooses someone random to talk to you, video optional. You could enter some of your interests into a questionnaire, and the service will pair you up with people who have common interests. The company also added a college student chat option, so it will link you with other students that go to GW. If you don’t like the person you’re talking to, just move onto the next chat – it’s better than nothing.
For those who want to stick to people you know, make it a movie night with your roommates and watch poorly-aged films or romantic comedies. Poke fun at the so-called perfect love stories and talk about the beauty of being single. Buy your friend chocolate from Baked & Wired and write them a love letter. All this to say, there’s no need to head out on the town to meet up with someone you might not ever see again. Plus, I can’t imagine a new relationship blossoming after contracting COVID-19 from one another.
For those who want to connect with people they have not seen in a while on Sunday, make a homemade card and send it off to your distant family member or friend. Tell someone who lives in a different state that you’re thinking of them, or order a bouquet of flowers and have it delivered to their doorsteps. If they live relatively close, meet at a park and exchange small gifts. If you want to do something truly selfless, take a few minutes to send a Valentine’s Day card to a child at St. Judes. You don’t need to take a road trip to their home or invite them to your apartment for a candlelit dinner – a note or flowers would do.
In case anyone missed the running theme here, I want the antithesis of a typical Valentine’s Day this year. Accept that we are all alone and stay that way, physically. Coronavirus cases are slowly starting to go down and there is absolutely no reason to hinder that success. So my fellow single college peers, desperate to get out there and mingle again, stay home so we can have a better Valentine’s Day next year. Place your focus on taking care of yourself and those closest to you because 2021 should be a year of reflection and improvement, not regression to the mistakes of 2020. Make your Valentine’s Day about more than the commercialism of empty romantic gestures. Work toward self love and platonic love because that deserves to be celebrated equally and socially distanced.

Remember to grab D.C.'s signature mumbo sauce when you visit Henry’s Soul Cafe.
For those craving a warm southern meal while the snow falls, Henry’s Soul Cafe is your next go-to.
The cafe, located at 1704 U St. NW, is the self-proclaimed “Home of the Sweet Potato Pie,” offering several southern style soul food to patrons. Henry’s Soul Cafe started as a deli carryout in 1968 and has since expanded to two locations, with one in the District and one in Oxon Hill, Maryland.
The D.C. location is not open on Mondays, but you can grab a meal between 11 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Sundays. Neither location is currently open for in-person dining, but you can pick up your food or get it delivered.
The restaurant offers four categories of protein on its main menu – seafood, beef, poultry and pork. You can choose from dishes like a fried filet ($10.99), the catch of the day ($11.25), meatloaf ($10.59), fried chicken or a turkey breast.
For a slightly cheaper lunch choice, opt for a sandwich or sub. You can fill it with minced barbecue pork, fried chicken or salmon on a choice of white bread or cornbread. Most sandwiches cost about $9.
The main menu options are filling, but make sure you save room for the sides. Henry’s Soul Cafe whips up several classic southern style side dishes like corn bread stuffing, potato salad and candid yams (all $3.49). Remember to also grab some of its tangy mumbo sauce to drizzle across your wings or fish.
We each selected sandwiches to start. I grabbed the barbecue chicken ($6.25), and my roommates ordered the pork ($9.45) and catfish ($8.75) stuffed sandwiches.
The barbecue sandwich meat comes separate from the bread for customers to assemble themselves, which I appreciated because it kept the sandwich from becoming soggy on the ride home. The meat was drenched in the restaurant’s signature sauce, a rich brown gravy.
While the meal could become a bit pricey with delivery fees, the portions make up for the price. I had more than enough of the succulent chicken to piece together my sandwich and saved the rest for a later meal or snack.
I was hesitant when I saw that the only component of the sandwich was the meat itself, but upon first bite, it was apparent that nothing else was necessary to complete the sandwich. The barbecue sauce was a decadent combination of savory and sweet without being too rich.
We got takeout tubs stuffed to the brim three sides – leafy collard greens ($4.99), white rice doused in more of its signature sauce ($4.99) and crispy chicken wings ($1.75) that fell effortlessly off the bone.
Too stuffed to consider desert, we opted out of the sweet potato pie ($3.25 per slice) this trip, but after seeing its rave reviews, I would include it in my next order.
Opt for mouthwatering, home-cooked barbecue at Henry’s Soul Cafe on your next takeout lunch or dinner.

A new two-way bike lane could be installed near campus, following a notice of intent that the District Department of Transportation issued late last month.
DDOT announced plans to install the lane along Virginia Avenue from Rock Creek Trail to Constitution Avenue in hopes of connecting Rock Creek Park to the National Mall for local cyclists. The installation would become the third major protected bike lane project near campus in the past year, after officials completed a new lane on G Street and started constructing lanes along 20th and 21st streets this fall.
“Protected bike lanes on Virginia Ave NW have been part of strategic planning efforts for many years and will help close a gap in the regional bikeway network,” the project’s notice of intent reads. “When the project is complete, people on bikes will have a safer connection from Rock Creek Trail, Theodore Roosevelt Bridge/I-66 trail, Capital Crescent Trail and National Mall to Downtown.”
Jeri Epstein, the chair of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, said ANC commissioners are “very supportive” of bike lane projects and expect to approve the initiative at their monthly meeting next week.
Epstein said installing the new bike lane along Virginia Avenue would offer cyclists a safe travel method and ultimately help the District become more “bike friendly.” She said the lane would encourage commuters to opt for a more healthy and eco-friendly means to travel around the District instead of driving a car.
“We will never get rid of cars,” Epstein said. “It’s not going to happen. But we could provide an option where people who are not attached to their cars – didn’t love them – say, ‘Wow, I don’t need to take my car out. I could take a bike, a scooter, I could walk. I think there are a lot of options for me. Why don’t I be a healthier person?’”
The notice of intent states DDOT officials plan to start construction on the bike lane in the fall.
Alumnus James Harnett, a recent graduate and the former chair of the ANC, said the plans are part of a “long-term strategy” by the District government to build protected bike lanes across the city.
“It will allow you to get on campus from G Street, where we have a two-way protected bike lane, to the National Mall and to Rock Creek Park and all the way up to Maryland in a protected cycling environment,” he said. “This is the last gap we need to fill to make this network a reality, and that’s why it’s really exciting and why I’m so happy to see D.C. moving forward on this.”
Harnett said he hopes installing the bike lane will be a step toward the District’s Vision Zero goal, aimed at eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries. He said he wants to incentivize the use of other forms of transit like cycling and public transit to limit the number of cars in the District and slow the effects of climate change.
“This road right now is dangerous,” he said. “It’s oversaturated with travel lanes, it’s way too big, so this project represents a really great step forward in preserving human life and making sure that moving forward we have an environment that allows everyone to be safe.”

SBA President Jackie Fisher said the fund has allocated money to more than 100 students for needs, like rent and utilities, office equipment and transportation expenses.
The Student Bar Association Senate unanimously approved five pieces of legislation at its meeting Tuesday, allocating money to a fund that provides financial assistance to law students for expenses, like transportation and rent.
Senators passed legislation to provide $10,000 to the Student Assistance Fund and to temporarily eliminate the requirement for student organizations to host a fundraiser during the spring semester. Senators also voted to continue election rules enacted amid the COVID-19 pandemic for the body’s upcoming spring elections and called on officials to increase the permissible number of Credit/No Credit courses transfer students can take at GW.
SBA President Jackie Fisher said in her opening remarks that the senate should allocate funding to the Student Assistance Fund now, instead of waiting to use leftover funds at the end of the year, to meet students’ “urgent” needs that have surfaced in light of the pandemic. She said the fund, administered by GW Law’s Dean of Students Office, has allocated money to more than 100 students for needs, like rent and utilities, office equipment and transportation expenses.
“As we all know, the financial hardships that our students have dealt with have been substantial,” Fisher said.
SBA Sen. Joshua Gilmer, the chair of the finance committee, said the fund has been “an absolute incredible resource” for students during “these difficult times.”
The body also unanimously passed an act that prohibits the SBA finance committee from considering organizations’ “lack of spending” during the 2020-21 academic year when drafting their budgets for the next academic year.
Gilmer, a sponsor of the bill, said SBA bylaws require that each law student organization hold a fundraiser each academic year to maintain its budgetary standing, but the bill will waive the fundraising requirements for next year’s budget.
“Quite understandably, holding a fundraiser, much less an effective fundraiser in the middle of a pandemic when so many of our students are struggling in especially difficult ways, is not a feasible requirement,” Gilmer said.
Senators unanimously approved a resolution calling on officials to allow transfer students to take an equal number of Credit/No Credit courses as non-transfer students. The resolution also calls on officials to allow transfer students to use Credit/No Credit courses that they did not use in the fall semester.
SBA Sen. Andrew Latham, the sponsor of the resolution, said the goal of the legislation is to place transfer students on “equal footing” with their peers for class rankings. Transfer students are allowed to take eight credits for Credit/No Credit, but non-transfer students are allocated 17 credits for Credit/No Credit, Latham said.
“I highlight this just to show the uneven grounds in which the school administrators have laid out their arguments on,” Latham said. “So this request to extend Credit/No Credit to those transfers who did not opt to use it is a minor request in the face of all the many issues that transfers must deal with.”
Senators also unanimously approved a bill establishing the rules for the upcoming spring elections.
SBA Sen. Adam Manning, a sponsor of the bill, said the legislation essentially reauthorizes the fall 2020 election provisions for this semester’s election. The provisions include eliminating the use of in-person campaign materials on campus and limiting candidates’ use of Facebook groups for their campaign.
The body also unanimously approved the creation of a student-run brief blog for the Latin American Law Student Association, which will seek to introduce topics of diversity and racial equality to the GW community and serve as a platform to promote Latino voices. Students who want to run a blog must submit an application for approval to the SBA’s student organization and charter committee, according to the legislation and the body’s governing bylaws.
SBA Sen. Pavan Patamalla, the sponsor of the bill, said the blog, entitled “LLB,” will highlight international law while creating a platform for students to “embrace” and “enhance the diversity of our GW Law student body.”
“The idea of the blog is to give students from a Latin American background the opportunity to talk about issues that the Latinx community faces in the U.S.,” Patamalla said. “A lot of the legal issues that the Latinx community faces are ones that have touched my family and friends, and it’s important as a traditionally underrepresented group of individuals that we give them this platform.”

GW will host a sustainability summit Thursday, featuring guests like chef José Andrés and U.S. Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill.
Sustainable GW originally planned to host an in-person summit last April in honor of Earth Day’s 50th anniversary, but the pandemic led officials to reschedule the event for this week. The summit will take place virtually from noon to 6 p.m. and include panel discussions on policy, community resilience and energy innovation in the face of climate change, according to the event’s agenda.
“Because GW’s strengths lie at the intersection of science, arts, health and policy, and since our campus community tends to focus on what we do in D.C., this event takes shape around themes that address policy and our role in the nation’s capital,” Meghan Chapple, the director of the Office of Sustainability, said in a release. “We’re highlighting GW’s accomplishments and the change that our GW community members can still help make more broadly in our city, our country and our world.”
Here’s what to look for on the agenda:
The summit will begin with a keynote interview about the future of sustainability with Casten, the U.S. representative for Illinois’ 6th congressional district, moderated by Frank Sesno, the director of strategic initiatives at the School of Media and Public Affairs and the former SMPA director.
University President Thomas LeBlanc will address viewers at 12:30 p.m. ahead of a discussion featuring panelists who will address the upcoming challenges GW’s environmental, social and governance responsibility task force will face to achieve the University’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2030.
The summit will also include a discussion titled “Climate and Community Resilience” at 1:40 p.m., during which panelists will discuss the role that universities, corporations and local and federal governments play in the fight against rising global temperatures.
At 2:45 p.m., the summit will feature GW’s deans, who will each highlight the work that their school has been doing to address climate change. Provost Brian Blake will discuss the value of cross-disciplinary research and teaching on sustainability.
Panelists will have a conversation at 4 p.m. about “energy innovation” and ways of encouraging the purchase of renewable, efficient and clean energy, followed by closing remarks from celebrity chef and activist José Andrés.

Updated: Feb. 11, 2021 at 2:15 p.m.
The Student Association election will take place March 24 and 25, the Joint Elections Commission announced Tuesday.
The JEC – the body that oversees SA elections – released a statement saying students can register to run for president, executive vice president or senator between Feb. 24 and March 3, and eligible candidates can campaign beginning March 4. JEC commissioners will announce election results on March 25 via Facebook Live, an advisory states.
The presidential and executive vice presidential debates will also take place March 22 via Zoom, the release states.
In light of the virtual spring semester, the JEC is modifying the election through several measures, like suspending the annual postering day event and suspending in-person campaigning on GW-affiliated grounds. Candidates cannot campaign in any classroom environment, including Zoom, Blackboard Collaborate and WebEx, but the use of previously made group chats on platforms like GroupMe does not violate campaigning rules as long as they don’t “disrupt” academic affairs, an advisory states.
The JEC also require that candidates create a social media account separate from their personal platforms that serves as the primary means of communication with constituents. The new account will help the JEC monitor all campaign activities, according to an advisory.
Candidates will not be required to receive approval from the JEC to release virtual campaign material for the election, but the JEC reserves the right to tell candidates to remove a social media post if it violates SA bylaws. Candidates are limited to sending two messages to constituents if the recipient does not communicate back with a candidate, the JEC release states.
Per updates included in the SA’s revised constitution, senate seats in the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design and the School of Media and Public Affairs are on the docket for the election.
Undergraduates in Corcoran and SMPA running for a senate seat will have the option to run for either a Columbian College of Arts and Sciences undergraduate seat or for the seat of their specific school. Undergraduates in both Corcoran and SMPA will also be able to vote for a CCAS undergraduate seat and a seat to their specific school.
Graduate students in the Corcoran or SMPA will only be allowed to vote or run for CCAS graduate seats. All students enrolled in the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration may run for either CCAS or Trachtenberg but will be eligible to vote for both seats.
This post was updated to clarify the following:
A previous version of this story stated that undergraduates in CCAS and SMPA could vote for a senator running for a CCAS or SMPA seat. CCAS and SMPA undergraduates can vote for a senator running for both CCAS and SMPA.

Bradley said the move is on par with the organization’s goal last year to increase BSU’s presence on campus and student engagement.
The Black Student Union has published its first official website in more than five years to give prospective and current students of color insight into minority life at GW.
The website, which is accessible through the University’s Office of Student Life page, launched Sunday. The new website will offer students interested in learning more about Black students’ presence on campus an up-to-date look into the student organization’s activities, members said.
The website is broken down between BSU leadership, press releases, a directory of Black student organizations and information about the the Rethinking.DC Project, a research scholarship cohort that aims to grasp the Metropolitan Police Department’s operations, reduce youth arrests and move youth away from the criminal justice system.
Senior Devon Bradley, the president of BSU, said the executive board began working on the website in last August, but students pushed the project off for a couple months as schedules picked up. He said when he was a prospective student researching GW, he struggled to find current information about the University’s Black student life.
He added that the website’s creation fits in with the organization’s goal last year to increase BSU’s presence on campus and student engagement.
“As a Black student, or even as the president of BSU, it makes me happy to know that Black prospective students now have something to look at, something that shows the Black community,” Bradley said. “They can go to a page and see all the Black organizations.”
BSU’s website was last updated for the 2014-15 academic year, according to the organization’s website.
Sophomore Brianna Hawley, a graphic design student who worked on the website, said the website took more than a month to complete.
“My favorite part about the site is definitely the cabinet and executive board pages just because each member of the BSU gets to have their own tab and a little bio and just a picture of ourselves,” Hawley said. “It’s nice to have representation of who are the active members that year in case you want to contact anyone or have personal questions for specific roles that are going on in these issues. That is definitely my favorite part.”

LeBlanc said as GW enters its third century, he is looking to make the University more accessible and inclusive for current and future students.
Some of GW’s most prominent alumni and top officials, along with other community members, gathered virtually Tuesday to kick off the University’s bicentennial celebration, exactly 200 years after Congress established the University charter.
The speakers – which included University President Thomas LeBlanc, Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights, alumna and CNN anchor Dana Bash and alumna and actress Kerry Washington – described the impact of the University since its founding in 1821, linked together by mini-documentaries highlighting GW’s 200-year history. The event, which officials said attracted about 4,300 registered attendees, was the first installment of a monthslong series celebrating the bicentennial, which will conclude at Colonials Weekend in October.
LeBlanc said GW has played a role in shaping the nation’s history, including student movements during the Vietnam War, when the University housed students from across the country who traveled to D.C.
“It’s a chance to look back at the history of our University, but it’s also a chance to look back at the history of our country because our institution in our nation’s capital is intertwined with the history of our country,” LeBlanc said.
He added that as GW enters its third century, he is looking to make the University more accessible and inclusive for current and future students. The COVID-19 pandemic has again exposed the “fault lines” in society, disproportionately impacting communities of color, he said.
“We need to make sure that higher education, which I believe is the greatest force for social mobility in our country, is accessible to all,” he said. “We need to enroll a diverse student body, we need to have a diverse faculty and staff and we need to ensure that our students can be successful.”
LeBlanc said officials’ decision for GW to become test-optional has increased the diversity of the applicant pool, but work remains to ensure students have the financial resources to attend GW. Officials received more than $22 million in gifts last October toward financial aid.
“We will continue to raise those funds so that we can ultimately meet the full need of the neediest students here at GW,” LeBlanc said.
Beyond recruiting a diverse student body, LeBlanc said he will work with the Multicultural Student Services Center, the Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement, the Black Student Union and Latino organizations to make all students feel welcome on campus.
“We need to make sure that they can be successful in the classroom, whether it’s ensuring that they have access to the classes they need or they have the support that they need to be successful academically,” LeBlanc said. “We want our students to be able to graduate, ultimately go out into the world and change the world so that in the future, we’re not dealing with these same problems.”
During the event, University Presidents Emeritus Steven Knapp and Stephen Joel Trachtenberg joined LeBlanc for interviews with alumna and journalist Reena Ninan to talk about GW’s recent history as they set their eyes toward the future.
Knapp said GW has always sought to educate “citizen leaders” for the country and has since expanded to serving students in all 50 states and across the globe.
“That sense of having a front row seat in the theater of both American history and global history really is a hallmark of the institution,” Knapp said. “But at the same time, I would point to this really remarkable entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to service on the part of our students, so it’s that combination of global reach and this extraordinary focus on creativity and service that I think are continuing hallmarks of our students.”
Speights, the Board chair, said she is focused on inclusion, equity and supporting a high-quality academic experience as GW marks its bicentennial.
“This past year has presented many challenges, and our path forward, like all universities, is uncharted,” she said. “But unlike other universities, we have the advantage of benefiting from this fabulous GW community. This community is why I firmly believe that we are positioned for preeminence as a comprehensive global research university in our third century.”
Throughout the event, some of the University’s most prominent alumni in politics, journalism, entertainment and other fields spoke about their experience as students and how it shaped their eventual careers.
“Tonight is all about how all of us have made GW what it is today,” Bash, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 1993 and now serves as CNN’s chief political correspondent, said at the event. “We have two centuries of ‘Only at GW’ moments, two centuries of GW memories and two centuries of bonds that form this lifelong community.”
Earlier in the day, Mayor Muriel Bowser proclaimed Tuesday as “George Washington University Day” in the District in honor of the bicentennial, and President Joe Biden and former President Jimmy Carter also sent letters of congratulations.
Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who earned a master’s degree in 1992 and appeared during the kickoff event, spoke on the U.S. Senate floor Tuesday to mark the occasion.
“Founded as a modest Columbian College 200 years ago, there was no guarantee that The George Washington University would succeed,” Duckworth said. “Ultimately, it was the dedication, ingenuity and hard work of many generations of world-class faculty, impressive students and accomplished alumni over the past two centuries that accounts for why GW evolved into the preeminent, global research university it is today.”
