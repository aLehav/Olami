Political science professor Forrest Maltzman used federal dollars to study why some laws are slapped with amendments more than others. But, ironically, one measure inked on Capitol Hill last week could put projects like his in jeopardy.
Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., attached an amendment to a congressional spending bill to defund $10 million of political science research financed by the National Science Foundation. Congress approved the measure last week, part of a larger package to avoid a government shutdown.
“I am somebody who thinks that this is a very small investment, and understanding how institutions work can frequently save countries, nations, states and cities significant resources,” Maltzman, who is also the senior vice provost for academic affairs, said. “So as a political scientist, I am disappointed that our government does not see the value in political science research.”
This year, four political science professors at GW are working with NSF grants worth a total of about $690,000 on topics like how Americans’ attitudes toward social groups like Muslims affect their political beliefs. The roster of professors who are NSF-funded includes the department’s most prominent faces, like associate professor John Sides.
The cuts – which will shave off a sliver of the federal budget through September – may have a chilling effect on political science research. But it does not affect other social science research, like anthropology or sociology, and instead limits agencies to fund only projects that promote “national security or the economic interests of the United States.”
Coburn, who has railed against political science funding for years in the Senate, said defunding work in that field could help pay for most life-saving medical research.
“Studies of presidential executive power and Americans’ attitudes toward the Senate filibuster hold little promise to save an American’s life from a threatening condition or to advance America’s competitiveness in the world,” Coburn wrote in a letter to NSF director Subra Suresh last week.
Maltzman has worked with five NSF grants over his career. He said the government funding rollback would harm political scientists performing expensive research such as surveys.
“If that money was not available, it would set back that type of work,” he said.
Some political science professors like Sides have organized against foes like Coburn. On his popular blog The Monkey Cage, Sides has posted petitions to block Coburn’s amendment and urged readers to contact their congressional representatives.
But, he said in an email, it’s an old and understandable fight. “Old because this has happened on and off for years. Understandable because the desire of many in the GOP to cut federal spending leads them to look for targets,” he said, adding that Coburn, Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., have “for whatever reason” looked down on political science.
He said it was too early to tell how drastically the defunding would affect research like his because the national interest clause could be interpreted rigidly or loosely.
Professors in the department are also working with grants funded by outside organizations, including the MacArthur Foundation and Carnegie Corporation, which would prevent major damage to GW’s political science research operation.
And Maltzman said as political scientists, they are able to maintain perspective of how Congress operates.
“I think sometimes Congress makes good decisions, and I think sometimes Congress makes poor decisions. And this is one of their poor decisions,” he said. “But truthfully, I’ve never defined my worth by what the United States Congress thinks about my work.”

GW’s favorite sharp-tongued Twitter jester has gone on an indefinite hiatus.
The 2010 alumnus notorious for sniping at administrators in 140-character bursts as @fakeStevenknapp announced Friday that his tweeting days are over.
Hunter Patterson, who spent three years pulling the strings behind the parody Twitter account @fakeStevenknapp, which boasts more than 3,700 followers, said he wants to take a break to focus on his career as a media consultant for DC London – a campaign consulting firm for politicians and issue activists.
“I think I’ve done everything I can do with this,” Patterson, who holds a degree in international affairs, said. “I’ve been a part of the conversation, and it has been fun.”
Patterson sometimes tweeted dozens of times a day, offering edgy – and at times sexist or otherwise offensive – commentary on administrators and University happenings.
The 24-year-old launched the account in 2010 and has posted almost 2,500 tweets since then, interacting with students, campus leaders and even officials like Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski.
Patterson kept his identity a secret until the Washington Post interviewed him in March 2012. He considered dropping the account then, but decided to hold off because he could not resist the opportunity to continue barraging the University with criticism.
But over the last few months, he said he’s seen the number of retweets on his account decline.
He inspired copycats, with hoax accounts popping up parodying Konwerski, a frequent tweeter, and the University Police Department, among others.
Fake Twitter handles have appeared for officials at more than a dozen schools across the country, including American University, the University of Maryland and the University of Virginia.
Patterson said during his senior year, he was inspired by other parody accounts of public personalities, such as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. He said he expected to attract “maybe a few hundred followers.”
Patterson kept up by searching for #GWU on Twitter, as well as following The Hatchet, The GW Patriot and WRGW. Hesitant to claim he made an impact on the University, he  said he thinks he at least kept students interested in University decisions.
“I’ve been able to keep people plugged in,” Patterson said. “I think people enjoy me, but I don’t think I have that much sway.”
@fakeStevenKnapp endorsed senior Hugo Scheckter’s satirical campaign for Student Association president this year. Scheckter said Patterson’s persona engaged the student body more than the real Knapp.
“I think that in the minds of most recent GW students, @fakeStevenknapp is the president of our university,” Scheckter said. “He will be missed.”
Patterson said neither the University nor its actual president ever contacted him, but Knapp responded in another letter shortly after, defending his efforts to reach out the student body, highlighting walks around campus with his dog Ruffles, snowball fights with students and drum solos at University events.
The real Knapp, who has headed GW since 2007, has faced criticism for his lack of face-to-face interaction with students beyond semesterly office hours.
He defended his relationship with the student body in a letter published in The Hatchet in November 2011.
“Even if I held office hours all day every day, seeing a different student every 10 minutes, this would leave me with time for (quite literally) nothing else!” Knapp, who does not have an official Twitter account, wrote in the letter.
In his blog, Patterson asked readers to preserve his legacy, saying, “I don’t want anyone to steal the handle,” but another account called @FakeSteveKnapp launched just minutes after his announcement. He said his next – and final – tweet will come when Knapp retires.
“Then, the account can pass on into Internet oblivion,” Patterson said about his masterpiece. “It’s been a hell of an experience.”

Elissa Froman, an alumna and political activist representing Jewish communities in D.C. and nationally, died Thursday at age 29.
Froman, who graduated with a degree in Judaic and women’s studies, was a congressional lobbyist for the National Council of Jewish Women and an active member of GW Hillel before her 2006 graduation. She specialized in civil liberties, the separation of religion and government and social justice.
She was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease, a cancer of the lymphatic system, when she was 23 years old – the same year she graduated from GW. Froman received the news at GW Hospital after she entered the emergency room for dehydration. Teetering between recovery and relapse, she battled through years of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.
She chronicled her experience with stem cell transplants and her search for a bone marrow donor on her blog.
GW Hillel Rabbi Yoni Kaiser-Blueth said Froman was one of the first alumni he met when he came to GW in 2010. He said she was warm, smart, caring, adventurous and “passionate about doing good deeds and paying it forward.”
“We had a few amazing encounters on the way,” he said, adding that he distinctly remembered how the alumna’s face would light up whenever someone mentioned the GW Jewish community organization. “She just wanted the best for GW and for Hillel.”
Yoni said Froman regularly attended Friday night services and dinners at Hillel, and visited the Gewirz Center on 23rd and H streets for the group’s annual alumni weekend.
Joanna Feldman, who launched a website to raise money for her friend’s medical bills, posted that Froman entered the hospital in February 2012 for complications related to a stem cell transplant, barring her plans to attend rabbinical school that summer.
The site raised more than $45,000 in five months with almost 750 donations – just a few thousand dollars short of its $54,000 goal. Feldman posted that Vice President Joe Biden had written a letter to Froman in October 2012 while she stayed at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
Froman is survived by her father Michael nee Salzberg, mother Gloria and a sister, Rebecca.

After a great deal of waiting, the University finally announced that actress and alumna Kerry Washington will speak at Commencement this spring.
But despite her connection to GW and her resume, which includes films like “Django Unchained,” “Ray” and “The Last King of Scotland,” some students were disappointed.
It’s easy to understand their  frustration since, in the past several years, the speakers have included high profile names like first lady Michelle Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams.
And that disappointment was compounded by the list of people nominated earlier this year to potentially receive honorary degrees, like actress Meryl Streep, basketball star Magic Johnson and Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va.
As a student body, it’s very easy to think of the graduation speaker as someone who students and parents can brag about to their friends and family. With Oprah Winfrey speaking at Harvard University and the Dalai Lama at Tulane Unversity this year, students at GW wish that they, too, could boast a big name celebrity on their campus.
Many see the keynote as responsible for bringing an element of prestige to the University and producing a sound bite for CNN.
But we should focus on the actual content of the speech – not who is speaking. Washington is a rising star, and despite her youth, she will likely have a great deal of advice and wisdom to offer the Class of 2013.
In recent years, GW has fallen into a cycle of choosing politicos and members of the media as speakers, who frequently speak to large crowds. Perhaps Washington’s speech will be a breath of fresh air, a departure from the typical recycled Commencement speech.
At a school that prides itself on political science, international affairs and journalism programs, and that has poured millions of dollars into a new Science and Engineering Hall, the arts and humanities programs often go overlooked. But the decision to invite Washington is an indication of the University’s commitment to these programs.
Washington has spoken at GW before: She delivered a speech in the Marvin Center during Alumni Weekend in 2008. Additionally, she had a high-profile speaking gig at the Democratic National Convention in September. But there’s a number of reasons why students should look forward to hearing her speak.
Her activism in areas such as sustainability and LGBT rights will appeal to a large portion of the student body at this progressive school.
As a former member of the Board of Trustees and an alumna, she has the ability to speak to the student experience at GW in ways that others couldn’t.
As students, we’ve bought into the notion of superficiality. It’s true: Washington isn’t as famous as some of the other honorary degree candidates like Streep or Cantor.
And while she probably was not anybody’s first choice for Commencement speaker, Washington’s upcoming speech is something every graduate should look forward to.

I vividly remember three years ago watching my brother graduate from GW on the National Mall. That was the year first lady Michelle Obama gave the Commencement address.
There had been so much hype about the speech. The student body worked all year to log 100,000 service hours to lock her in as the headliner.
But what was most memorable about Obama’s speech was how unmemorable it really was. I can vaguely remember her talking about how students should never give up.
To be fair, it wasn’t a bad speech. I just felt like I’d heard it all before – and I don’t think I’m alone in that sentiment.
Now that I’m set to graduate in May, I’ve been thinking about what this year’s keynote speaker, actress and alumna Kerry Washington, might say to the Class of 2013.
I’ve spent some time reading and watching a number of commencement speeches. And after consideration, I realized that the best graduation speeches are those that avoid showering the students with praise about their accomplishments. The best graduation speeches tell the audience something they don’t want to hear – something that makes people a little uncomfortable.
That’s the purpose of college: to debunk everything you’ve been taught for so many years – to tell the unpleasant truth. It’s the notion that what you thought you knew all along is really a sham. It’s that horrifying realization that what you thought was the truth – that what looked and felt so obviously real on the surface – was nothing but hot air.
When I think of a good graduation speech, I think about former Baltimore Sun journalist David Simon’s address at Georgetown University last year. Simon is famous for his HBO series The Wire about the drug trade in Baltimore. He told the Class of 2012 something quite unconventional, and it offended some.
“For starters, my generation probably owes yours an apology. Because, hey, we definitely shanked it. We choked. We let ourselves get distracted with greed, with gloss, with the taste of the bread and the glitz of the circuses. We took our eyes off the prize,” he said.
These are harsh words. But at the same time, I don’t see how anyone could ever forget a line like that – an apology from one generation to the next.
It’s an example of honesty in its purest form, the kind that is all too rare when it comes to graduation speeches. We failed, and now it’s your duty and responsibility to fix it, Simon said. And the truth is, you’ll probably fail too.
What is lacking in a lot of commencement speeches is a dose of reality. It’s all too easy to search for words and metaphors that just brush the surface and leave the graduates with a pat on the back and a job well done. What was daring about Simon’s speech is that he didn’t sugarcoat anything. He effectively said our generation is inheriting a world plagued with injustice.
It’d be too simple for speakers to tell us stories of how they toiled for a few years only to emerge from the wilderness enlightened and ahead of the pack. I hope that’s not the case. At a time as uncertain as this one, in a job market that is both unforgiving and intimidating, the speaker would do us all a favor by speaking candidly.
In 2005, novelist David Foster Wallace didn’t tell Kenyon College graduates that their lives would be happy from here on out. In fact, he said quite the opposite.
“The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what ‘day in, day out’ really means,” he said. “There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I’m talking about.”
Wallace was honest with his audience. He didn’t romanticize the years ahead. He was realistic.
If I have one wish for the graduation speaker this year, it’s that she’s honest with us. I hope she doesn’t tell us how special and wonderful we all are. I hope she doesn’t leave us with inflated egos.
I hope Washington catches us off guard. If she’s willing to do that and step outside the bounds of what’s popular and superficial, she might just deliver a speech that people still remember 20 years from now.

Student Association elections are a time of overbearing self-promotion and often-meaningless promises. Last week, candidates shoved fliers into our hands in Kogan Plaza and covered the walls of the Marvin Center staircase in posters.
It’s easy to poke fun at these politicians-in-training as they spend hundreds of dollars and countless hours struggling to gain positions that many students don’t even know exist.
So, on some level, I appreciate what senior Hugo Scheckter tried to do with his satirical campaign, highlighting the absurdity of the whole election process as “King Hugo.” But it was a distraction from the platforms of other candidates, who tried to offer legitimate solutions to campus problems.
Tuesday night’s debate was a chance for Scheckter to use his humor to talk about changes he would actually like to see on campus. But instead of informing the audience, he was merely a distraction for students who wanted to learn about the other candidates’ platforms.
There’s a time and a place for everything. And the debate, which is the culminating and arguably most important event of the campaign season should not be wasted on mockery.
Scheckter failed to offer any real examples of ways to fix campus issues, instead resorting to obscenity-laden complaints about topics like the construction of the GW Museum, which will partially house textiles, at the center of campus. He offered no remedy to the situation and barely suggested how to better use the space.
If Scheckter really wanted to make a statement about the casual disregard the administration practices in its dealings with the student body, then he should have dedicated his campaign entirely to it in a more serious fashion.
Satire is only effective when it’s working toward making a specific point. It’s a lot easier to tell someone they are wrong rather than explaining why. If you’re going to step out on stage with people who claim to have solutions for our problems, you can’t only tell me their solutions are flawed. Running a satirical campaign is fine, but for it to be meaningful, it has to have some substantive ideas as a foundation.
The most frustrating part of this situation is that someone with as much visible wit, passion and charisma as Scheckter didn’t direct those energies where they would have made the most impact. It’s evident from the influence he had on this race and the 775 votes he received last week during the election that a real effort on his part would have been a force to reckon with.
In between jokes, he did make a serious point. In one of his final statements of the debate, Scheckter encouraged every student to “question the decisions that are being made [by the administration].” This should have been the centerpiece of his election effort – not the sole genuine moment in an otherwise comedic campaign.
Personally, I would’ve been eager to hear his solutions to the many problems we face on this campus.
At the end of the day, absurdities aside, the issues being debated affect the daily lives of every student on this campus. And while comedy has its place, student life here will be much better off if we all actually engage with the system rather than having a non-participatory laugh at its expense.

Though it might not have been a full 180-degree turnaround, the Colonials’ perfect results this weekend could foreshadow that the formerly struggling squad has improved.
But then again, nothing in baseball dominates a game’s storyline better than lights-out pitching.
Over a combined 27 innings of work between Friday and Sunday, GW’s hurlers allowed only two total runs. And in the first 18 of those innings, they didn’t allow a single walk. It was an effort that stood in striking contrast to their performance against the Hoyas last Tuesday, when the Colonials’ pitching allowed 10 runs in one game alone.
After going down easily against Georgetown, GW (7-15, 3-0) rolled into its first Atlantic 10 stint this weekend with sights on taking down conference foe Massachusetts. Heavy snowfall in the Northeast forced the Minutemen to Barcroft Park, where they fell victim twice to the Colonials on Friday (4-1 and 7-1) and then again on Sunday, in 1-0 shutout fashion.
“What anted up in this series was consistent pitching and execution of pitches,” head coach Gregg Ritchie said. “It’s a nice way to start the A-10. But those games are done, and we’ve got the next opponent coming up.”
Despite their recent non-conference struggles, all was surprisingly calm in the Colonials’ dugout before the final game Sunday. The lineup card on the near wall bore starters’ nicknames instead of their real ones. New Orleans native Matthieu Robért, the freshman catcher, was jokingly written in as “Mardi Gras.” Senior outfielder Tyler McCarthy, who had two extra base hits on the day, was chalked in as “The General.”
Whether it was good vibes that kept the players loose, or just a newfound focus on going out and getting the job done, the Colonials played consistent baseball against the Minutemen, from the first pitch of game one until the final out of game three.
Game one started off with three GW hits in the first inning, the final coming off the bat of freshman infielder Eric Kalman and driving in the game’s first run. In the fourth, Robért smacked his second long ball of the season, putting the Colonials up 2-0. Senior infielder Justin Albright added a run to the tally in the same frame, knocking an RBI single to the outfield to put GW up 3-0.
On the hill, junior Luke Staub was a force. In seven innings of work, he gave up just one run on five hits while fanning five batters. Junior Craig Lejeune, who also got the save on Sunday, closed the door on the Minutemen with two innings of flawless relief.
The second half of Friday’s doubleheader was much of the same: dominant GW pitching, with an added dose of run support. Junior Aaron Weisberg turned in a one-run complete game, striking out six along the way without giving out a single base on balls. The Colonials had two big innings, a four-run fourth and a three-run sixth, on the way to a 7-1 rout of Massachusetts.
Senior outfielder Ryan Rickey went 4-7 in the doubleheader, with three doubles and the same number of runs batted in.
“We’ve honestly come so far in the first half [of the season],” freshman pitcher Max Kaplow said. “We earned each one of these wins this weekend and it’s huge that we are coming together. Mostly, I am so proud of this team because of how much work went into having things click.”
Game three on Sunday was a quiet one, but didn’t lack the strong pitching performance that highlighted games the first two. Kaplow turned in a six-inning shutout effort, working his way out of many tough jams along the way, including two with the bases loaded.
A textbook hit-and-run play by Kalman in the top of the fourth scored junior Owen Beightol in what turned out to be the game-deciding hit. The game went down to the wire, but ended in favor of the Colonials, completing the sweep.
“None of these wins were handed to us. It’s a confidence builder, but at the same time we have to find ways to get better and build on what we did well,” Kaplow said.
Winning three games to open the conference schedule is an impressive feat for a club that has struggled mightily thus far in non-conference play. But despite the major improvements on the pitching and hitting sides, Ritchie sees a few areas that must be addressed.
“We still had fielding errors, we still had a throwing error with two outs,” Ritchie said. “We had opportunities to execute a couple of times and get another run across the board, but we didn’t do it. So we have to take care of that.”
The Colonials will switch back to non-conference play when they travel to UMES Tuesday.

We’re all familiar with satire. From a Mark Twain novel to The Colbert Report, satire acts as an effective way to criticize and draw attention to society’s flaws. At its best, satire illustrates caricatures of ourselves that are so accurate we cannot help but laugh.
And satire was the cornerstone of “King” Hugo Scheckter’s campaign for Student Association president, when he ran on the platform of turning the SA into a monarchy.
Scheckter’s satirical campaign was at once hilarious and insulting, witty and rude, refreshing and obnoxious. But regardless of what you think of him, we would be doing ourselves a great disservice if we merely dismissed “King Hugo” as an arrogant jackass or attention-seeker.
Scheckter’s satire makes a great point: As he said in his closing remarks at the Student Media Debate Tuesday night, students should never be afraid to say “no” to an administration that doesn’t always listen to our concerns. As students, we must be bold.
University policy impacts us greatly. But all too often, the SA representatives only nod their heads meekly while administrators steamroll them in their haste to implement new plans and policies.
As Scheckter emphasized, it doesn’t make sense for the University to implement something that doesn’t help students or something overwhelmingly unpopular. If a university ceases to take the interests of its major beneficiaries in mind, then it has seriously failed to do its job.
Scheckter pointed to the construction of the GW Museum, which will partner with the Textile Museum, as an example of the University’s failure to provide for students, especially at a time when students are complaining they do not have enough space on campus.
But even if you don’t take issue with the museum, I’m certain all students can think of at least one instance when administrators have frustrated them, whether it’s through the noisy, early morning construction or J Street’s high prices.
Of course, getting the entire student body to actually agree on something is an impossible task. That’s why we have SA representatives in the first place – to represent our collective views to the best of their ability ­– and it would be ludicrous to expect administrators to respond to our every gripe.
However, if an administrative move is widely unpopular, SA leaders should not let it pass without a fight. Students must find creative ways to urge the University to address student needs.
Scheckter’s slogan read “GW doesn’t care about students. Neither does King Hugo.” If nothing else, students should take his campaign as a signal to speak out when they feel their opinions no longer have weight.
Granted, at the end of the day, we’re all just students. We don’t have the experience or power of administrators or trustees. But we have numbers, and we have voices. If we rise up and communicate our problems to the SA, and the SA in turn demonstrates those problems to the University, we cannot be ignored.
So let’s take Scheckter’s advice to heart. He may not be representing us as SA president next year, but we can still make our voices heard. We just have to yell loudly enough.
