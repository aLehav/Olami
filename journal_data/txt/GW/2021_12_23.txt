It has been a year like no other for GW.
The University kicked off 2021 with a desolate campus as students began a second full semester of virtual learning.
Our reporters were on the ground to cover the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. National Guard troops later filled the streets of Foggy Bottom as GW braced for the inauguration of President Joe Biden.
The spring semester came to a close with the news that outgoing University President Thomas LeBlanc would retire at the end of the 2021-22 academic year. His remaining year at GW turned into a semester when of Trustees Chair Grace Speights announced in September that former Washington University in St. Louis Chancellor Mark Wrighton will serve as interim president at the start of 2022 for up to 18 months while the Board searches for a permanent leader.
As classes were wrapping up in May and vaccines became widely available, officials decided to move forward with plans for an in-person fall semester. The roadmap for returning, dubbed “Onward GW,” included a vaccine mandate, a bi-weekly COVID-19 testing requirement for vaccinated students and an indoor mask mandate.
Thanks to your support, The Hatchet’s news team has been able to spend the fall covering breaking news on campus including the desecration of a Torah scroll in the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house and mold outbreaks across campus that led to health scares for many students.
The Hatchet’s Editorial Board weighed in on some of the University’s biggest moves this year, including LeBlanc’s departure, GW’s decision to enroll in Metro’s U-Pass program and protests against the University’s handling of Title IX cases.
This year has given us the opportunity to share crucial information with the University community, but our mission is routinely threatened by financial strains. We rely on readers like you to continue delivering vital news and thoughtful analysis to the GW community and beyond.
I hope you’ll consider making a tax-deductible donation to The Hatchet here to ensure we can continue to cover the University as it gears up for a presidential transition and continues responding to the pandemic.
Thank you for reading The Hatchet in 2021 and from our entire staff, have a happy holiday season and a safe, healthy new year.

At about 5 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, the GW community received an email from officials informing them of plans to hold courses remotely until at least Jan. 18 and a new deadline of Jan. 10 to receive the booster. 
Though disappointing for students and professors alike, GW’s decision to make the first week of the spring semester virtual will likely prevent a 2020-esque end of school year debacle. 
The return of online courses does not have to be permanent and does not necessarily translate to a repeat of March of 2020. Though many of us harken back to how we felt then, and are wary of a similar situation arising again, this decision is a sign of the University taking precautionary measures to ensure that students are fully vaccinated and boosted, COVID-free and ready to come back to class in person. Public health experts are saying that Omicron has a much higher rate of transmission than the Delta variant, but the infection is much milder. This time around, the GW community will also be both vaccinated and boosted, which gives solid protection against Omicron. 
GW isn’t the only entity taking the Omicron variant seriously. Mayor Muriel Bowser unveiled a new action plan to fight the virus’ new avatar on Monday. Bowser is expanding testing sites in the District, reimposing the indoor mask mandate and emphasizing the need for all who are eligible for vaccines and boosters to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Bowser announced Wednesday that indoor venues like restaurants and bars will be required to ask patrons for proof of at least one dose of vaccination. 
Other universities are also taking similar measures. Most University of California universities, Gallaudet, and Harvard universities will temporarily hold classes online at the beginning of the spring semester. 
After a disheartening end to the 2020 school year, and a lack of the 2020-21 in-person school year, many of us were relieved and excited to come back to campus this year. It’s valid to feel worried and anxious at the prospect of more online classes. To some extent, we were aware of the unpredictability of a pandemic, and yesterday’s announcement confirms this unpredictability. But hopefully we don’t have to give up too much this time around. 
By tightening COVID-19 restrictions, increasing expectations and incentives for D.C. residents to get vaccinated, and increasing testing resources, Bowser is indicating that the government is taking DC’s COVID situation seriously. Similarly, by mandating the booster three weeks earlier than the intended Feb. 1 deadline, and holding online courses for the first two weeks of the semester, the University shows that it is dedicated to bringing students back to campus.

This last week has been a doozy at GW. As students hurtled toward the end of finals season, a wave of COVID-19 cases on campus prompted the University to abruptly move many finals online and close facilities to the public. Just yesterday, officials dropped the news that the first week of classes will be held virtually — an ominous sign. As the Omicron variant blankets the District and the country, the possibility of the pandemic getting worse is not the holiday gift anyone had in mind.
But on the bright side, the nearly two-month-long Metro service cuts are on their way out, and winter break has arrived. For now, students can sip eggnog with visions of sugar plums, booster shots and U-Pass cards dancing in their heads.
Here’s the best and worst from this week’s headlines:
Thumbs up:
We did it – the first (mostly) in-person semester of the pandemic era is now over. Late nights hunched over textbooks studying for finals have now yielded to holiday festivities and, if you’re like me, obsessively refreshing BanWeb every approximately nine seconds to check final course grades.
As students go through the holiday season and eventually turn their eyes toward returning to campus next month, they can look forward to an end to the Metro service cuts that have caused an unquantifiable number of headaches for the GW community and beyond. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced that the beleaguered 7000-series train has gotten the green light to re-enter service, after a derailment sidelined the workhorse of Metro’s fleet for months.
It will take more than three months from now until all of the suspended trains – which make up 60 percent of Metro’s fleet – reenter service. But as the fleet is phased in, service will improve – just in time for students to make full use of U-Pass when they come back to campus.
Amid all of the awful COVID-19 news that I’ll get to in a moment, there is one positive headline – the University rolled out a booster shot requirement. All students, faculty and staff will be required to submit proof of having received an additional dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. Initially, this deadline was Feb. 1, but it has been moved to Jan. 10 to try and head off a surge in COVID-19 cases as classes resume.
GW was one of the first universities to announce a vaccine requirement last year, and it is once again ahead of the curve in mandating boosters. The University made the right decision here – administrators made a swift, decisive call informed by science to protect the community. They deserve credit, full stop.
Thumbs down: 
The booster requirement is pretty much the only good news on the COVID-19 front. Cases have skyrocketed at GW, in D.C. and throughout the country in the last week. Record-shattering positivity rates at GW prompted administrators to move many final exams online and to close campus to the public. Just days later, Mayor Muriel Bowser reimposed the District’s mask mandate. And yesterday, the University announced that the first week of the spring semester will feature a return to online classes. The booster deadline is being moved to January 10 as well.
This explosion in cases is happening just as students are leaving campus and dispersing throughout the country and the world to celebrate the holidays – even fully vaccinated students should be extremely careful about not potentially infecting their families and loved ones.
This is very bad news. There’s no two ways about it. People are getting sick, learning is being disrupted and hopes of a normal holiday season are slipping away. There’s no consolation or silver lining to finding out that we might be headed back to the hellish Zoom University format that tormented us for two and a half semesters. After nearly two years of this, to see things get worse instead of better elicits a bitter, gnawing sense of dread. What students can and should do now is get booster shots sooner rather than later, avoid massive unmasked gatherings and get tested regularly if possible.

A Student Association senator resigned a few hours after the last senate meeting of the semester.
Former SA Sen. Alex Griffin, CCAS-U, who served as the chair of the sustainability committee, stepped down earlier this month after he voted against a resolution recognizing outgoing University President Thomas LeBlanc’s accomplishments during his time in office. Griffin said he was thinking about resigning during the week before the meeting because he wanted to spend more time working with student organizations focused on sustainability, but SA Vice President Kate Carpenter asked if he could stay on for the last meeting.
“The SA takes up a lot of time, and I just felt like the time that I was investing into the SA was not time I wanted to be spending,” Griffin said in an interview.
Griffin spent about seven months in the senate and served on the student engagement committee, which disbanded over the summer. He said instead of preparing to be a “politician” in the SA, he will use his free time to work with student organizations like the GW Greenhouse Club, which looks after the Wilbur Harlan Greenhouse in the Science and Engineering Hall.
Griffin and SA Sen. Sofia Packer, U-at-Large, were the only senators to vote against the President LeBlanc Recognition Act at the meeting earlier this month, but Griffin said he was expecting a more “heated discussion” on the resolution. He said his opposition to the senate’s decision to pass the LeBlanc resolution made it “easier” for him to resign.
The Faculty Senate passed a similar resolution of appreciation for LeBlanc last month before he steps down at the end of the calendar year to cede the presidency to Mark Wrighton, the former chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis who will take on an interim role.
“We shouldn’t even really be acknowledging him but just move past it and focus on our new interim president and move from there,” Griffin said. “And I mean, at least personally, I view his job as something that should be pretty thankless. I found us recognizing him or even acknowledging him just felt a little gross.”
Applications for Griffin’s undergraduate CCAS seat closed Monday, according to the SA Instagram page.

The White House had previously maintained that the repayment pause would not last beyond the original Jan. 31 endpoint.
President Joe Biden extended the moratorium on federal student loans through May 1 amid nationwide spikes of COVID-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant.
Student loan borrowers have received the option to pause their monthly bills without incurring interest on their debt since March 2020 following the pandemic’s outbreak. The White House had previously maintained that the repayment pause would not last beyond the previously set Jan. 31 endpoint.
Biden said the U.S. Department of Education would work with borrowers during the next 90 days to transition back to collecting regular loan payments.
“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever – with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent – we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday.
Biden said borrowers should prepare to transition back to regular loan payments to ensure personal financial stability and to help boost the national economic recovery.
“As we are taking this action, I’m asking all student loan borrowers to do their part as well: take full advantage of the Department of Education’s resources to help you prepare for payments to resume; look at options to lower your payments through income-based repayment plans; explore public service loan forgiveness; and make sure you are vaccinated and boosted when eligible,” the statement reads.
The pause on student loan repayments will help 41 million American student loan borrowers save a total $5 billion per month, according to federal data.
An estimated 89 percent of student loan borrowers are not financially secure enough to start repaying their student loans by February 2022, according to a survey conducted by the Student Debt Crisis Center and Savi, two financial advocacy outfits.
Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said the extension will ensure borrowers will have the resources they need to start repaying their debt by the beginning of 2022.
“This additional extension of the repayment pause will provide critical relief to borrowers who continue to face financial hardships as a result of the pandemic and will allow our Administration to assess the impacts of Omicron on student borrowers,” Cardona said in a statement.
Cardona said ED has provided almost $13 billion in relief to more than 600,000 student loan borrowers.
“Students and borrowers will always be at the center of our work at the Department, and we are committed to not only ensuring a smooth return to repayment, but also increasing accountability and stronger customer service from our loan servicers as borrowers prepare for repayment,” Cardona’s statement reads.

D.C. and GW officials are tighteneng COVID-19 restrictions to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, which continues to accelerate across the city and inflate positive caseloads heading into the new year.
The number of daily positive COVID-19 tests at GW and across D.C. currently stand at record highs, with 121 positive results at GW Monday and 1,155 in D.C. Tuesday, according to the most recently available data from the University and city. GW and the District have responsed with new measures that will start limiting public activity in the city, including an online return to the spring semester and a new citywide mandate that will require residents to show vaccination proof to enter restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues.
After COVID-19 cases started to surge on campus earlier this month, GW canceled in-person gatherings for the rest of the fall semester Friday and moved the remainder of final exams online.
Georgetown University officials announced last week that university-sponsored events must take place virtually or outdoors after the school reported its highest single-day total of COVID-19 cases to date, The Hoya reported. The University of Maryland also announced that it would cancel winter commencement ceremonies in the face of rising COVID-19 cases.
The University announced Wednesday that the spring semester would start with at least one week of remote classes, and students must receive their booster shot by Jan. 10 instead of the previous deadline set for Feb. 1.
Other higher education institutions, including Gallaudet and Harvard universities, announced that they will hold classes temporarily online at the beginning of the spring semester
On the citywide level, several restaurants have temporarily closed as employees have tested positive, at least 25 D.C. public schools have moved to virtual operations and Mayor Muriel Bowser reinstated the District’s mask mandate, which she lifted last month for most indoor settings in response to the recent spike in COVID-19 cases.

The University recognized Smith as one of its 72 “monumental alumni” who were honored as part of GW's bicentennial celebration earlier this year.
Clarice Smith, an alumna and philanthropist who donated millions of dollars to the University, died earlier this month. She was 88 years old.
Smith earned a bachelor’s degree in art from GW in 1976 and a master’s degree in fine arts in 1979 before she joined the University as a faculty member in 1980, where she taught watercolor and portraiture within the Department of Fine Arts and Art History for seven years, according to a University release. Smith and her late husband Robert, a former member of the Board of Trustees who donated $10 million in 2008 to renovate the Smith Center, helped fund the Smith Hall of Art, named after the married couple at the Academic Center.
The University recognized Smith as one of its 72 “monumental alumni” who were honored as part of GW’s bicentennial celebration earlier this year.
Smith’s art, which features portraits, still-life arrangements and landscapes, has been displayed all over the world, and she hosted several solo exhibitions in galleries across the globe in cities like London, Paris and Jerusalem.
The Luther W. Brady Art Gallery – an art exhibit in the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design – showcased some of her work in 2013, and one of her paintings is permanently displayed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the release states. Her work has also appeared on display at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the New York Historical Society, the National Sporting Library and Museum and the Kreeger Museum.
Outside of her GW contributions, Smith donated $15 million to the University of Maryland, which opened the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center in her honor in 2001, according to The Washington Post. She received honorary doctorate degrees from GW in 2012 and from the University of Marland in 2015.

The Colonials will be back in action next Thursday in their Atlantic 10 opener against St. Bonaventure. 
Men’s basketball postponed its match against Maryland Eastern Shore Wednesday to curb the spread of COVID-19 as the region faces an uptick in cases driven by the Omicron variant.
Both teams are currently working on rescheduling the match, the athletic department announced in a release Wednesday. The game was supposed to conclude the Colonials’ non-conference slate and marks the first postponement of an otherwise smooth season after the pandemic delayed last year’s season.
Last year, the squad was forced to postpone 10 matches, including a stretch in which the team did not play any matches from Jan. 18 until Feb. 20.
Officials announced in an email this past Thursday that all facilities would be closed to the public effective immediately, stating basketball games for the following week would be taking place without an audience moving forward. Officials announced Wednesday that classes would be held online for at least the first week of the semester as they respond to an all-time high of coronavirus cases.
The Colonials will be back in action next Thursday in their Atlantic 10 opener against St. Bonaventure. Tip-off is scheduled for 4 p.m.

Matic met a time of 46.14 in the men's 100 butterfly topping the 46.63 records set by Phelps in 2011.
Junior swimmer Durde Matic beat a record set by 28-time Olympic medalist Michael Phelps in the 100 butterfly at Lejuene Hall Pool at Navy earlier this month.
“Durde is off to a good start for us, and his results are reflective of his consistency and balance in training,” Head Coach Brian Thomas said. “He executes everything we give him really well, so I’m not shocked that he’s in a good spot. The pool record at Navy was a fun swim but nothing really more than that. We’ve moved on to get ready for what’s next.”
Matic swam in the men’s 100 butterfly where he met a time of 46.14 topping the 46.63 records set by Phelps in 2011 and set the fastest time in the pool by over 1.8 seconds, according to an Athletics Department release.
Matic, a native of Serbia, had beat the A-10 conference record the previous weekend where he set the event in a time of 45.72. He received the A-10 Performer of the Week honor for the second consecutive and the third time of the fall.
Before joining GW, Matic joined the East Carolina Pirates during the 2020 spring semester where he helped the team in their effort to acquire the 2020 ACC title. He claimed bronze in the 100 fly with a time of 47.52, finished in ninth-placed in the 50 free with a time of 20.33 and claimed sixth place in the 100 back with a time of 48.83.
The swimmer has also met success at the international front as a member of the Serbian Swimming Federation. In March 2021 he posted the Olympic B cut swim in the 100 fly event at the Serbian Open.
He won the 50 fly, 100 fly and 200 back in the 2020 Serbian National Championships and competed in the 2018 FINA Swimming World Cup in Budapest.
The Colonials will take a small break from the fall season as they prepare to enter the spring season in the incoming semester.
