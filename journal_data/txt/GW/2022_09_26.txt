On offense, sophomore opposite MC Daubendiek led the Colonials with 10 kills throughout the match, and junior outside hitter Elizabeth Drelling and sophomore outside hitter Brittany Myers tallied eight apiece.
Women’s volleyball lost its three-game winning streak after failing to keep a steady offense and committing multiple attack errors against Loyola Chicago this weekend.
The Colonials (6-9) faced off against the Ramblers (8-7) in a double match Friday and Saturday at the Smith Center, where GW held a lead during each of its first sets but failed to hold the momentum for the remainder of the two matches. Graduate libero Bella Bowman tied for the second-place all-time dig leader in program history, now standing at 1,682 through her career.
Here’s a recap of the games this weekend:
Match One
The Colonials dropped their A-10 opener with a 3–1 loss in the first match against Loyola Chicago Friday, losing the first set 25-23, the third set 28-26 and the fourth set 25-17. They eked out a 25-21 victory in the second set.
In the first set, the Ramblers performed 15 kills against the Colonials’ 10 kills on the way to their early victory. Ties at the 22nd and 23rd points gave GW hope, but a kill helped the Ramblers close it out 25-23.
The Ramblers got off to an early 5–1 lead in the second set, but GW managed to pull with their 10th point during the first half, a lead they held until their 25th point clinched their set victory. The Colonials collected nine kills and a .208 shooting percentage in the set.
Both teams were on top of their offensive game in the third set, but GW’s 15 kills and .308 shooting percentage were not enough to match the Ramblers’ offensive onslaught. The Colonials dropped the third set 28–26.
The Ramblers carried their momentum into the final set to secure their first A-10 victory with a 25–17 win. The Colonials played their worst set of the day, tallying only eight kills and recording a .031 shooting percentage.
On offense, sophomore opposite MC Daubendiek led the Colonials with 10 kills throughout the match, and junior outside hitter Elizabeth Drelling and sophomore outside hitter Brittany Myers tallied eight apiece. Sophomore setter Grace Allread and freshman setter Dilara Elmacioglu contributed 18 and 16 assists, respectively.
On defense, graduate middle blocker Tierra Porter led the team with eight blocks, pushing her to a team-leading total of 83 blocks of the season.
Match Two
GW dropped its second match Saturday, losing the set split by a 3–2 margin.
The Colonials shot at a .205 clip where they held 51 kills, 56 digs and five spikes over the afternoon. The Ramblers averaged a .261 shooting percentage with 76 kills, 83 digs and five spikes.
In the first set, the Ramblers kicked off with a 6–4 start and continued to maintain a lead that the Colonials fought to overcome with consecutive three-point runs, though to no avail, ending the first set 25–19.
The second set started with an early lead for Loyola Chicago 3–0 as the Colonials struggled to get on the scoreboard early in the action. A set of consecutive kills by Womble and Daubendiek turned the match around for the Colonials, entering a nine-point run in the final minutes of the set, which they went on to win 25–23.
The Colonials continued their success in the third set where the GW team maintained a two-point lead throughout the first minutes. The Ramblers fell into a marathon of attack errors that allowed GW to further the lead by five points during the half.
The Ramblers came out on top with a 25–22 lead, as they gained momentum through the set while entering several five-point runs.
Loyola Chicago led a fierce offensive battle over the Colonials in the fourth set and kept a six-point difference between the teams. The Colonials could only put together 13 points while the Ramblers offense took off.
The fifth ended with a 15–13 win for the Ramblers, who hit 10 kills while GW made a series of attack errors.
The Colonials fell short of repeating their winning performance from the past three matches with a softer defense that failed to keep up with Loyola Chicago. GW will return on Friday where they will face off Duquesne at 6 p.m. at Pittsburgh.

With the search for the University’s next president well underway, long-term strategic planning at GW is in limbo. The pandemic rendered former University President Thomas LeBlanc’s already-unpopular strategic plan obsolete, and because of his limited interim role, University President Mark Wrighton is overseeing the transition to GW’s next president without a strategic plan of his own. And now, with the goal to set GW on a path to global renown, the Board of Trustees and academic deans have weighed in on their own vision for the near future with a series of academic priorities for GW, including equity and social justice, sustainability and climate change, data science and academic medicine.
But there’s an easier, more tangible way of improving the University’s prestige before setting sail for a lofty future – focus on the fundamentals of the academic experience first so students have the basic support they need to succeed. Between a lack of classroom accommodations, deadnaming students in official communications and yet another member of the faculty who defended his use of the N-word, the University is failing its students in the most glaring ways. GW can’t become a leader in higher education solely with ambitious academic priorities when students don’t even feel welcome in its classrooms – it needs to go back to the basics and treat students with decency and respect.
These academic priorities come at a time when GW’s long-term strategic planning is still in flux. LeBlanc’s 20/30 plan, which focused on cutting undergraduate enrollment and refocusing academics around STEM education, floundered amid the pandemic and outcry from faculty. And instead of leaving his own mark on GW, Wrighton acts more as a caretaker than an innovator, focusing on repairing the relationships between students, faculty and officials that LeBlanc’s leadership damaged.
So in the absence of a strategic plan, complete with corresponding policies and programs, the deans’ and Board of Trustees’ academic priorities offer the University some form of guidance for the future. Instead of a singular plan spearheaded by GW’s president, the University’s areas of focus are all meant to attract “world-class” faculty and “enhance GW’s global reputation,” Provost Chris Bracey said at a Faculty Senate meeting earlier this month.

A more equitable and sustainable GW would undoubtedly be a better university, and more funding and administrative attention for data science and medical programs will surely catch the eye of top-notch students, researchers and professionals. But that vision assumes these academic priorities actually come to fruition. These priorities read more like a wish list than an actionable to-do list, never mind the fact that GW’s next president could outline a different strategic plan entirely, like investing in the humanities or focusing on career training.
If officials are really committed to equity and social justice, they can act right now. For one, stop deadnaming students in University communications. To their credit, the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement and GW Information Technology emailed students last Friday with guidance about changing their name in a variety of University systems. But now, they need to ensure that these processes actually work.
That sense of respect should carry into the classroom as pandemic-era accommodations like more lenient deadlines and remote classes recede. Last October, the Post-COVID Academic Innovation Task Force released findings that students supported recorded lectures and virtual office hours and professors wanted the option to teach remotely, in person or in a hybrid format with the training and equipment to do so. But outside of Disability Support Services, the accommodations students receive largely vary from professor to professor.
And while this semester is already well underway, requiring faculty to publish their syllabi to Blackboard in advance of the first day of class and offer free, unexcused absences for personal or mental health reasons would make it both easier and less stressful to participate in classes. Students could plan out their assignments well ahead of time instead of scrambling to read the syllabus minutes before their first class. A more lenient policy toward unexcused absences would also give students the opportunity to momentarily put aside their academic responsibilities to focus on their well-being.
When we say GW needs to get back to basics, we’re really asking for officials and faculty to do the bare minimum – use our names, accommodate our needs. The news that a professor defended his use of the N-word in front of his entire class earlier this month exemplifies officials’ failure to do so. When a professor so brazenly and recklessly defends their use of a racial slur to their students, it’s evident that previous lessons on creating an inclusive educational environment haven’t stuck with all faculty members. Although the professor is no longer instructing this class, allowing him to continue to teach at GW this fall confirms that the University’s training and disciplinary efforts aren’t working. GW must fire this professor – cycling a racist member of faculty between different courses is no way to create an academic experience that welcomes every student.
The measures we propose aren’t as glitzy or glamorous as brand new initiatives, but they will have a much greater and much more immediate impact than a series of academic priorities that never come to fruition. There may not be an awards ceremony nor ribbon cutting when a student receives a routine email that uses their name, watches a recording of class or sees a syllabus appear on Blackboard, but it will mean a great deal when students can take those expectations for granted.
Focus on the minute, tangible tactics that can quickly improve students’ academic experience, and leave the grand planning for Wrighton’s successor. If officials want GW in the spotlight, they’ll have to get back to basics and make their classrooms safe, supportive spaces first.

A panel of media figures from South Africa spoke about issues facing the country like political corruption at the Elliott School of International Affairs Thursday.
Mondli Makhanya, Pule Molebeledi, Branko Brkic and Ranjeni Munusamy each spoke about topics like the state of democracy, economic inequity and the energy crisis in South Africa. Institute for African Studies Director Jennifer Cooke moderated the event, which was hosted by the institute.
Cooke introduced the panel by highlighting recent diplomatic engagements between the U.S. and South Africa, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip in August and President Joe Biden’s meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa the week before, along with the recent appointment of former Elliott School Dean Reuben Brigety to the position of U.S. Ambassador to South Africa. She also referenced the upcoming 2024 general elections and the need to repair relations between the people and the government.
“If you read the South African newspapers there is a lot of talk about ‘Is South Africa a failed state, is it a failing state?’” Cooke said. “And we’re going to examine that a little bit today.”
Munusamy, a South African political commentator, spoke about most powerful party in the country’s politics, the African National Congress, and its December conference where they will pick their presidential nominee.
“So, for those in the audience who are not familiar, what happens is that every five years in December the ANC holds a national elective congress with the top six leaders of the party, including the president, is elected as well as an 80-member National Executive Committee,” Musunamy said. “The ANC is the governing party in the country and that NEC together with the top six is what basically directs what happens in the country and all the big decisions. But those people are elected by 5,000 ANC delegates representing branches and structures of the ANC from across the country.”
Makhanya, the editor-in-chief of the City Press newspaper, said when former President Jacob Zuma took over as the head of the ANC in 2007, it began 10 years of “chaos” and that the country is still recovering from Zuma’s corruption.
“That 2007 conference was seminal, it was a huge part of changing the country in the wrong direction,” Makhanya said.
Zuma, later elected to the South African presidency in 2009, dealt with several scandals throughout his career in politics, including using millions of dollars of public money to renovate his country estate and a sexual assault allegation.
Mounting frustrations with Zuma’s misconduct led to him resigning from the South African presidency in 2018. He was later sentenced to 15 months in prison in July 2021 after not appearing before a judicial commission during a corruption inquiry.
“We were about to go over the cliff and we managed to turn the vehicle around and avoided catastrophe,” Makhanya said.
Molebeledi, the director of news and media for Arena Holdings, a publishing group of multiple financial media outlets, said the “great” nation of former President Nelson Mandela has been betrayed by “chronic governance.” He said the country was once the largest economy in Africa, but it is now falling behind other countries like Nigeria and Egypt due to “indifferent management.”
Brkic, the editor-in-chief of South African newspaper Daily Maverick, said South Africa is also facing problems with its power grid due to mismanagement of its state-owned power utility, Eskom. He said about 20 years ago, he remembered the utility winning an award for its services.
Eskom now faces severe debt and implemented power blackouts across the country for more than 10 hours a day last week. The blackouts are happening because of Eskom’s need to save electricity and continue to operate its struggling and old power stations.
The panel then took questions from the audience on topics like the balance of power between older and larger parties and smaller and newer parties in South African politics. Answering a question on how the country equates itself to the world, Makhanya said the country is equating itself to its own government in the wake of 1994 and the end of apartheid.
“What it achieved was nothing short of a miracle,” Makhanya said. “The water that was rolled out through communities in the most rural areas and the electricity to many far-flung areas. Not many areas still have it, all but water. But basic services like clinics in communities and so on, basic health. The government in the first 10 years of the democracy actually did amazingly.”

Lauren Ann Wall is a second-year graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in public health and the director of communications for the GWU Disabled Students Collective. 
The COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and GW needs to stop pretending it is. Earlier this month, GW repealed its mask mandate in all settings except in classrooms and labs, but with its enforcement already gone, the move was just a formality. Professors and Student Association leaders have been going maskless before the mandate was ever lifted, posting openly on their social media channels and walking freely indoors with their faces uncovered. Besides masking, the end of dedicated isolation housing unfairly burdens low-income students with the need to make alternative arrangements to isolate from their infected roommates. And the University’s test-optional policy has left behind an inaccurate picture of COVID cases at GW.
Immunocompromised students have borne the brunt of the pandemic – many of us have been in total or near total isolation for more than two years. While those with healthy immune systems no longer need to be concerned with COVID, individuals with compromised immune systems need to vigilantly protect their immune systems or they could get very sick. Throughout my time at GW, I have constantly had to ask myself whether attending an in-person social event would be worth the risk of contracting COVID given the chance of exposure. But we could appropriately gauge our risk and assess our safety for in-person events if GW implemented a required-but-random testing method and reinstated its mask mandate.
Widespread vaccination and masking made it relatively safer to go out, but these measures rely on other people’s compliance. Those around us on campus often no longer wear masks, and students who have not been able to get vaccinated due to existing medical conditions lack the protection that others have. Basic in-person interactions, like attending student organization events on campus, could lead to weeks or months of active infection and then recovery – they’re too risky for immunocompromised students.
There’s a mindset on campus that the pandemic is over, but it’s not. After I and a few other students asked to tune into a class via Zoom, our professor said he hadn’t planned on offering remote learning this term given the new policies in place. This lack of accommodations for nondisabled students pressures them to go to class when they shouldn’t because they might be contagious or face a high risk of infection – if a student says they can’t come to class, then faculty need to believe them. Making students second guess whether they’re “sick enough” to stay home puts them at risk of contracting or spreading COVID.
And the consequences of COVID infections are much more complex than a binary of survival or death. This virus isn’t just a cold or flu – it can damage your lungs, heart and other organs. Nearly 20 percent of people infected with the coronavirus develop long COVID, which can cause them to experience extreme fatigue, chest pain, coughing and brain fog. These lingering symptoms can last for years. COVID can cause other secondary conditions and long-term disabilities that impact the body’s ability to circulate blood, lead to fainting and dizziness and make even the simplest tasks exhausting. And minorities, particularly Black and Latine people, have more negative health outcomes compared to white people after a COVID infection due to racial disparities in comorbidities and access to health care.
Since GW has repealed the testing mandate, the people who are getting tested are either very careful or actively sick. Without a randomized sample of our University community, GW’s daily positivity reports are watered down and make it harder for immunocompromised students to judge the risks they face. And as people retreat to indoor settings as we enter the colder months, infection rates are going to go up again. But how will we know without the proper data?
GW should implement a program to randomly test a sample of all people on campus, including faculty, staff and students. An algorithm could randomly select 20 percent of the population to get tested in two-week cycles, meaning each person would probably have to test about once a semester in practice. They could receive an email that gives them 72 hours to get tested before they lose campus tap access. And to clearly represent the state of COVID on campus, GW should analyze and present this randomly-collected data separately from the voluntary tests.
Other higher education institutions like Georgetown and Penn State universities and the University of California, Irvine have used this random testing method. Though testing has moved from the trailer on H and 20th streets to smaller locations at 1957 E Street and Monroe and the Science and Engineering halls, GW can still facilitate mass testing. American University has installed PCR testing vending machines throughout campus buildings, which allows students and faculty to test in their homes and drop off their tests at their own convenience without taking up much campus space. A similar model with self-administered, take-home PCR tests – which are far more accurate than rapid antigen tests – would allow the GW community to test easily without reinstating huge infrastructure.
Without these changes, more people will likely get sick, and those who will suffer the most are the already-vulnerable population of immunocompromised students. We need to reinstate and enforce the masking mandate to protect our immunocompromised peers until we have a more accurate and ongoing data set. Only when we are able to continuously assess the campus-wide positivity rate can we make well-informed policy decisions about the necessary procedures for COVID prevention on campus for the good of all members of our GW community.

Officials said about a third of all undergraduate students received federal loans last year, about 30 percent below national trends.
Officials said 3,171 – or 29 percent – of GW’s undergraduate students received federal loans in the 2020-21 academic year, inconsistent with the national rate of about 60 percent of undergraduates who borrow federal loans at private nonprofit institutions. The slim percentage suggests the White House’s plan to forgive tens of thousands of dollars of student debt will reach a minority of students, who said they wished federal officials forgave a larger share of their student loan debt than a fraction of their financial burden.
Jay Goff, vice provost of enrollment and student success, said about 37 percent of undergraduate students receive federal student loans during any given year at GW. He said on average, borrowers graduate with $20,500 of unpaid federal student loan debt, which equals about $205 of monthly repayments over ten years.
Goff said officials adjust GW’s financial aid counseling programs and communication from the Office of Student Financial Assistance to account for new federal policies, like the student loan forgiveness plan, each year.
“We plan to continue those efforts this year and will promote the loan forgiveness application process after it is launched later this year,” Goff said in an email.
The federal government will cancel $10,000 in student loan debt for borrowers who earn less than $125,000 or – if married – earn less than $250,000. Pell Grant recipients will receive $20,000 in federal student loan forgiveness through the plan.
After federal officials release the loan forgiveness application, students eligible for debt cancellation must apply by Dec. 31, the final day of the debt moratorium, on the Department of Education Federal Student Aid website.
Students who take out federal student loans are eligible to be enrolled in a standard repayment plan upon graduation that requires regular payments for 10 years, according to the federal student aid office. But some borrowers may not use the repayment plan due to its complex process that can confuse students with debt.
Alumnus Domonique Clemons – who graduated with a masters degree in political management in 2019 – said even after the $10,000 is canceled, he will continue to make similar monthly payments for the remainder of his 10-year public service loan repayment program through his work for a business membership organization, which some borrowers may not qualify for.
“For some folks, it’s going to be the difference of them being able to pay off their loans when they’re 60 instead of 61 or 62,” Clemons said.
He said the debt cancellation program is “healing a symptom” of student debt for current borrowers, but the next generation of college graduates will continue to face large amounts of debt after graduating college as tuition continues to rise and wages stagnate.
In March, officials announced GW’s cost of attendance will surpass $80,000 for the 2022-23 academic year.
“We haven’t done anything to address the costs of our education system and how much more expensive it’s continuing to get to pursue higher education,” Clemons said.
Patrick Realiza, a class of 2011 political science graduate, said the student debt cancellation program will reduce nearly half of his student debt, which is split between slightly more than $10,000 in federal loans and about $10,000 in private loans.
He said the moratorium on student loan repayment – which federal officials enacted in March 2020 and will last through the end of the year – helped him pay off credit card debt and save money for emergencies. He said the repeated extensions of the moratorium since the start of the pandemic were “nerve-wracking” because he wasn’t sure when he would have to resume repayment.
“Am I really ready to start to make student payments after the two-plus years of not?” Realiza said. “I’m very glad that the Biden administration acted, but I do think this should be the beginning. There should be more reform coming down the line.”
Realiza said his first financial aid package from the University was not “satisfactory” to afford GW’s tuition, and officials granted him more aid after he appealed his initial offer. He said 17- or 18-year-old students who are entering college don’t realize the gravity of borrowing $10,000 to $15,000 until they enter the repayment period after graduation.
He said he graduated a semester earlier than his peers in December 2010 and quickly realized after graduation that he was responsible for financially sustaining himself.
Realiza said while he was attending GW, he thought the financial aid was “generous” for a private university that does not have public funding, but GW should provide students with more resources to understand their responsibilities as loan borrowers, especially as tuition rates rise.
“When I look at the tuition rates now, I really wonder how our parents are financing these kinds of things,” Realiza said.
Leor Clark, a graduate student studying public health, said she attended a public university for her undergraduate degree and received fewer loans than many GW undergraduate students.
She said GW’s high cost of attendance stands in the way of any difference that the debt cancellation program could make in students’ financial situations. Clark said the plan to cancel up to $10,000 in debt for eligible borrowers is a positive step toward increasing college affordability, but she wishes the White House would raise debt cancellation to $50,000 to reach more borrowers.
“I imagine students here probably have like $100,000 to $200,000 in debt,” Clark said. “$10,000 is not going to be super helpful.”
She added that the process of taking out student loans was “overwhelming” because she was only 18 when she took out loans for college.
“It’s hard to conceptualize how much money you’re taking out at 18,” Clark said.
Emily LaBrasciano, a sophomore in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, said debt cancellation and debt moratoriums have eased the burden on student loan borrowers, but many students will still need more aid to afford higher education enrollment.
“I don’t think any student should ever go into debt for wanting to pursue education,” LaBrasciano said.
She said taking out loans was difficult as a first-generation student because her parents did not have the same experience and couldn’t guide her through the loan process. But she said the University’s resources for first-generation students, like peer mentors, have been useful for her because they offered the guidance and advice that her parents cannot provide.
“Taking out loans is so scary, and you just don’t know if you’re making the right choice,” LaBrasciano said. “You don’t know how you’re going to pay it back in the future.”

GW’s COVID-19 Medical Advisory Group will continue to evaluate case rates on campus and adjust the University’s COVID protocols accordingly. 
Even after the University eliminated mandatory COVID testing in June, officials are continuing to track case numbers on GW’s dashboard as part of ongoing monitoring efforts that align with all 12 peer schools.
David Diemert, the chair of the GW COVID-19 Medical Advisory Group and a professor of medicine, said the advisory group – the committee composed of faculty experts advising University COVID protocol – is “evaluating” changes to the dashboard because of the increase in individuals using take-home, rapid antigen tests after officials eliminated the biweekly testing requirement. All 12 of GW’s peer schools moved to optional testing, five of which continue to operate their COVID dashboard to track case numbers for the fall semester.
Diemert said the daily positive rate reported on the COVID dashboard does not represent the positivity rate for all GW community members and only represents individuals who chose to test through the University.
At this time last year, more than 33,000 tests were administered with a case positivity rate of 0.6 percent, according to the dashboard. Only about 5,700 tests have been administered so far this fall, with a total positivity rate of about 11 percent.
Diemert said fewer people are using GW’s testing centers after GW made asymptomatic testing optional, and officials will monitor COVID caseloads at GW and in D.C. and the number of COVID patients admitted to hospitals and ICUs to determine COVID protocols. He said there is no absolute threshold of positive cases on campus that would push officials to reinstate the biweekly testing requirement and the advisory group guides the University’s current COVID health protocols on masking, vaccinations and testing by using evidence- and science-based recommendations about COVID protocols.
“Tracking COVID-19 cases helps GW to decide if additional precautions should be instituted if the number of cases starts to climb,” Diemert said in an email.
He said GW takes guidance from the DC Department of Health “very seriously” and works closely with the department to adjust University protocols to changes in case rates. Diemert said the number of positive cases in the D.C. metropolitan area continues to decrease weekly and hospital rates in the D.C. area have consistently declined over the last few months.
DC Health currently classifies the current COVID-19 community level as “low” and has reported no new COVID related hospitalizations in the last two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports a decrease in average weekly COVID case numbers nationwide, reporting about a 1,000 case decrease per week.
“The MAG has been continuously monitoring the trajectory of COVID-19 globally and locally, and it reviews current data as well as national and local guidance including recommendations from the CDC and the DC Department of Health.” Diemert said.
GW’s 12 peer schools – Boston, New York, Northeastern, Syracuse, Tufts, Tulane, Georgetown and Wake Forest universities, and the universities of Pittsburgh, Miami, Rochester and Southern California – have similar optional testing protocols for the fall semester with all 12 peer schools making testing optional for community members.
Syracuse remains the only university to provide isolation housing for COVID-positive students and also provides vending stations across campus filled with highly subsidized self-administered COVID testing kits for community members.
Experts in medicine said that with the increase in at-home testing for COVID, universities with optional testing requirements need to have clear goals about how they report COVID data.
Robert Ernst – the chief health officer and the associate vice president for student life for health and wellness at the University of Michigan – said the university plans to continue to track COVID data throughout the semester but doesn’t require routine surveillance testing for students and faculty. He said Michigan’s dashboard recently went through an “overhaul” but continues to report transmission rates and identified case numbers.
He said the move to at-home testing represents an “evolution” in the pandemic to a point where individuals, instead of institutions, hold themselves accountable for isolation and testing when exposed. He said people having easy access to vaccines and providing information about how people can protect themselves from COVID are crucial public health strategies for colleges.
“Effective treatments, even for people who get COVID if they’re in a higher risk group, have really changed the ability to protect ourselves,” Ernst said.
He said now that doctors have more of an understanding of COVID, priorities have shifted from rigorous testing and contact tracing when the goal was to know about every single case at the beginning of the pandemic. Ernst said the University of Michigan Medical School implemented a permanent public health response and advisory group instead of an emergency response mode, like what would have been in place in the early stages of the pandemic, to manage the pandemic and other emerging infectious diseases.
“I think the virus has changed over the course of time, but our ability to protect ourselves against COVID has changed also through vaccination, prior infection, more easily accessible high filtration masks,” Ernst said.
Dahlene Fusco, an assistant professor of medicine at Tulane University, said the shift to at-home testing is a pitfall because the CDC doesn’t track results of at-home tests. She said even with university testing, the data needs to be clearly marked with their testing protocols to ensure the data is accurately read.
She said she encourages young people to take control and get tested if they want quicker, more accurate and widespread testing. Fusco said undergraduate students at Tulane started a pop-up PCR testing center out of a residence hall room and encourages any student who has an interest in virology to volunteer at testing centers.
“Don’t wait for mandates, learn how important it is to know what viruses are around so you can nip them in the bud and it’s only when we know what viruses are around that we can develop vaccines and treatments,” Fusco said.

Kalytchak said the institution’s creation of the fellowship program and the University’s expression of support for those impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine are signs of “solidarity” with Ukrainians.
Officials launched a fellowship program for scholars displaced by the war in Ukraine through an institute on Eurasian studies in the Elliott School of International Affairs this fall.
The Fund for Scholars Affected by the War in Ukraine pays the salaries of 12 scholars based in Ukraine or in neighboring countries this academic year as well as the salaries for two Ukrainian scholars based in D.C. this semester. Officials said the 14 scholars will research issues in international affairs, like the ongoing war in Ukraine that has displaced more than 13 million Ukrainians and caused an estimated 5,600 civilian deaths since Russia’s invasion in February.
Marlene Laruelle – the director of the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies – said program organizers worked with the Ukrainian Global University, a network of global educational institutions working to support Ukrainian students and scholars during the war, to advertise the program and select the fellows. She said the program admitted the fellows in August based on “meritocratic criteria,” like the quality of their application and past research.
The fellowship is funded by Jenna Segal, a GW alumna and a member of the Elliott School’s board of advisors, and her husband Paul Segal, who began working with the Elliott School to create the program three weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
“We want to keep Ukrainian scholars engaged internationally, so the price of the war is not destroying local knowledge and academic knowledge,” Laruelle said.
As of May, the war has damaged or destroyed more than 1,600 schools and universities. Russia’s targeted destruction of educational institutions could impede Ukraine’s ability to rebuild after the war ends because many students have limited access to their education, according to experts in war and conflict.
Laruelle said the program will host monthly virtual seminars to connect the residential and nonresidential fellows and provide opportunities for the fellows to speak to GW students about Ukraine and the ongoing war in classes affiliated with the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies. She said fellows in the program will also network with faculty who work with the institute and research similar topics, like the historical conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
“I think they are the ones who can still produce critical, analytical views on what is happening, and then they play a key role in teaching younger generations,” she said.
Roman Kalytchak, a senior visiting fellow in the program from Lviv, Ukraine, said he originally came to D.C. as a Fulbright Scholar affiliated with GW’s American studies department last October and expected to return to Ukraine this year but was unable to because of the war. He said the fellowship’s financial support allowed him to stay in D.C. and continue his research after his Fulbright scholarship ended this fall.
“The main advantage of the fellowship, in general, is that GW was able to bring together around 20 scholars, Ukrainian-based scholars,” he said. “It is important. Not Ukrainian scholars from American universities, but Ukrainian-based scholars so they have first-hand knowledge.”
He said the program is “mutually beneficial” to the fellows and to the institute because it provides Ukrainian scholars with the funding to continue their work and the fellows bring the institute first-hand knowledge to further its understanding of Ukraine.
“I think your country needs more knowledge, more expertise on Ukraine,” he said.
Kalytchak said his research revolves around how Ukrainians studying the United States see the U.S. as a global actor and how that perspective has evolved since Ukraine gained independence in 1991. He said he can further his research and understanding of U.S. diplomacy because of his location in D.C. through connections to diplomats and government agencies, like the Ukrainian embassy.
Kalytchak said the institution’s creation of the fellowship program and the University’s expression of support for those impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine are signs of “solidarity” with Ukrainians.
“It was an important gesture for us, for Ukrainians active in this University, to see this support from GW,” he said.
James Hershberg, a professor of history and international affairs and a member of the institute, said the fellowship’s support of Ukrainian scholars assists the broader Ukrainian educational community because Russia continues to suppress scholarship and target educational institutions in Ukraine through its military attacks.
“I think it’s very important and very needed because obviously anyone in Ukraine is under threat, but academics, in particular, are under threat,” he said. “And there’s a history going back to the Soviet period and earlier in Russian history of authorities in Moscow trying to extinguish Ukrainian culture, and specifically academic centers.”

During a retirement ceremony in the University Student Center Tuesday, GW community members celebrated Michael Tapscott’s legacy as the director of the Multicultural Student Services Center since 2003.
Students, alumni and administrators wiped away tears as they shared memories about Michael Tapscott’s deep imprint left upon the GW community at his retirement reception Tuesday.
More than 50 student leaders, alumni, faculty and staff gathered in the University Student Center’s Continental Ballroom last week to look back on Tapscott’s 19-year tenure at GW and his impact on the University community in celebration of his retirement, which he announced in June. Cultural heritage programming blossomed under Tapscott, who established the first annual Asian and Pacific Islander and Native American heritage celebrations in 2004 and the first annual South Asian Heritage Celebration in 2013 and broadened King Week programming to span two weeks.
But the former Multicultural Students Services Center director said he still views his “greatest badge of honor” to be his acquired title as the father figure of GW’s campus.
“I’ve always told people that I have the greatest job in the world because I have 1,000 sons and 1,000 daughters,” Tapscott said in an interview. 
After receiving more than five GW administrative and lifetime achievement awards and concluding nearly two decades of service at GW, students said Tapscott has left a legacy of inclusion and empathy at GW while in his father figure role.
“I don’t think there’s any word or compliment that’s any stronger or more rewarding than to be referred to as a parent,” Tapscott said. “I took it on as a part of the role that I played as director.”
He said the MSSC has grown over the years to embrace not just race and ethnicity, but also gender and sexuality with the addition of events like Trans Awareness Week in 2019 and the center’s expansion to include a LGBTQIA+ Resource Center in 2008. 
“What we tried to do was create a place where imagery, art, expression, names and faces on the wall, the colors, even the fonts of our productions will reflect underrepresented communities,” he said. “And what ends up happening is when people come in the door, they see themselves reflected on the walls and in the music and in the spirit of the place.”
Tapscott said he hopes people from GW carry on his “enthusiasm pledge,” with a raise of the right hand and an exclamation of a promise to be energetic, thankful and enthusiastic in everyday life as a way to encourage optimism and act as a “source of inspiration.” He said he takes the concept of enthusiasm “seriously” and would often connect with students he knew on campus and try to affirm them if they were having a tough day.
“Nothing more powerful than to see people waving and shouting out ‘enthusiasm,’” he said. “That’s how we’ve got to live life – otherwise, it’s not as much fun.”
Tapscott said his work establishing discussion series and diversity trainings to address racism on campus and encourage students to recognize privilege has stimulated “healthy conversation” as a mode to elicit change. He said he hopes administrators in the future work to de-escalate future acts of discrimination on campus through tighter community and educational discussion on the power words carry. 
“The most important thing you can ever do in a conflict is sit down and have a conversation about it,” Tapscott said. “And that conversation obviously has to be fair and often managed, but if you don’t talk, you don’t grow.”
Tapscott said he takes pride in knowing the comfort that the MSSC building on G Street offered students over the years, where he worked to foster an environment where they could feel comfortable taking long naps on the couches or stopping by his office to chat. 
“This amazing thing occurs – people breathe a sigh of relief because they know that they don’t have to look over their shoulder,” Tapscott said. “They know they won’t be questioned, they know they won’t suffer microaggressions, they know that they could go about their day, refuel, recharge and then go back to the business of being great.”
GW Police Department Chief James Tate spoke at Tuesday’s reception and presented Tapscott with a certificate and badge authenticating him as an honorary police officer. He said Tapscott has served as an inspiration within the GW community and alongside GWPD due to his “kind-hearted” personality and inclusive demeanor.
“Mike listens, he gives you the space and then somehow, someway, before you leave the room, he finds a way to lift you up,” Tate said.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton said at the reception that he realized after attending last year’s Black Heritage Celebration that Tapscott’s encouragement of campus development and genuine support for students made him “instrumental” to the University community. He said he first met Tapscott at last year’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration, calling Tapscott a “master of ceremonies” through his role attracting high-profile speakers to the event, like D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine.
“I know that others will make an effort to live up to your very high expectations, and I have hope that you will be long remembered as a key contributor here,” Tate said to Tapscott at the event.
Senior Gianna Cook, the president of the Black Student Union, said Tapscott made GW’s campus feel like a home thanks to shared memories in the MSSC and Tapscott’s support at BSU events. She said his legacy would live on with BSU and the Black community at GW.
“Mr. Tapscott has always been a friendly, generous and committed leader, from letting us host events at the MSSC to having laughs with one another and to always leaving his door open to a student in need, Mr. T has always been a person you can rely on,” Cook said at the event.

The DMV’s fall festival lineup features several standouts to enjoy before the District dips into cooler temperatures.
It’s that time of year again. With autumn just arriving, fall festivals are ready to pop up around the DMV for anyone looking to scavenge a pumpkin patch or taste some local craft brews.
As the leaves slowly turn to a warmer color palette, the new season welcomes a collection of cultural, musical and traditional fall festivals in the area.
