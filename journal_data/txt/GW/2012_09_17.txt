Student Association leaders are proposing a student fee to increase the funding pool for campus groups by nearly 50 percent.
The organization is looking to increase the mandatory student fee by $1, tacking on 50 cents per credit hour for students, Chair of the SA Finance Committee Alex Mizenko said.
Students pay $1.50 per credit hour with a 50 cent match from the University.
Any fee hike would have to pass a school-wide vote this fall and receive approval from the Board of Trustees.
The fee hike would add about $500,000 to the organization’s budget, which is allocated to about 300 campus groups each year. The group has about $905,000 this year – down from about $1 million last year, but coinciding with a climbing number of student organizations.
Mizenko said this year’s $145,000 gap comes from less year-to-year rollover and fewer reclaimed funds from student organizations that did not use their allocated money.
SA President Ashwin Narla said the funding pool “just really doesn’t meet the needs of students.”
The SA’s budget has steadily increased by 10 cents for the past five years, after a major student fee hike was approved for fall 2008.
Student body referendums struck down fee hike proposals in 2004, 2005 and 2007.
“Until the student fee is raised, the amount we are given by the University will fluctuate,” Mizenko said.
The finance committee will hand out grants later this month, typically ranging from $50 to more than $70,000.
Only incoming students would be affected by the hike because of the University’s fixed tuition policy.
Narla said he and Executive Vice President Abby Bergren will communicate with groups about alternate funding options and how to appeal for more cash after funding is doled out Sept. 24. Last year, 44 organizations won their appeals, earning a total of $27,000 around the first round of allocations.
“It is unfortunate that there is less money to go around, but we are going to do our best to communicate with these organizations,” Narla said.
“We’re going to sit down with student organizations and explain, ‘This is why you got this amount of money and what you can do to get more,’ ” he added.
The SA has tackled University fees for more than a year, lobbying to lessen charges like library printing and transcript requests.
Last year’s finance committee held information sessions about budgeting and earning funds outside the SA to prepare for the expected dip in the funding pool. Mizenko said he hopes groups this year will keep in mind what they learned during the workshops.
“Student organizations will have to work even harder to be efficient, collaborate and seek outside funding,” the finance chair said.
Alex Veliz, president of the Organization of Latino American Students, said his group will have to rely on other resources to make up for their expected cut in SA funding, including fundraising and co-sponsoring events.
“We’re basically just going to do what we can with the money we get,” Veliz said. “We’re not too worried, but we’re hoping for the best.”

Campus dining officials are rolling out a campaign to promote the year-old Metro Diner – a J Street cornerstone they said is falling short of expectations.
GW Campus Dining, which counts two new employees as of Monday, will plaster advertisements in residence halls and take to Twitter and Facebook to market the diner.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to answer questions about how Metro Diner fared financially for the past year, citing a policy not to release sales information.
Director of Campus Support Services Nancy Haaga said she hopes to see more interest in the diner, which is J Street’s largest venue and the only one open daily and late-night.
“It’s important that we are able to serve a significant body of customers out of that venue, because we’ve invested a lot of space in that venue,” Haaga said, adding she wants to publicize offerings like made-to-order omelettes and other new hot bar options, like scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon.
J Street’s first marketing director, Sarah Stevenson, started in August. Three top employees have turned over in recent weeks. Bernadette Thomas became general manager after longtime director Richard Yokely left this summer. The campus dining office also hired Gurmit Chaudhri to fill the retail manager position, vacant since last spring. Haaga said customer service and food presentation without an operational manager has been difficult.
The office also plans to roll out a more rigorous social media campaign this fall, but a year after promising to boost its online presence, the campus dining accounts on Facebook and Twitter attract little attention.
The Facebook page had just one September post as of Sunday evening. The Twitter account has not posted since May.
“We limped through last year,” Haaga said on the office’s communication. “It wasn’t nearly as effective as it can be, or as it should be. Clearly, we have big expectations about how things are going to be improved.”
The diner was the central piece of the J Street overhaul last fall when GW swapped out nine vendors for mainly Sodexo-run eateries.
Last year, Metro Diner was widely criticized for its long wait times, which prompted the University to add a hot bar to the venue this fall. Haaga said the new choices have decreased the wait time.
Haaga said the J Street team is focusing on creating more “monotony breakers” in daily menus, as well as events like a prix fixe surf and turf meal. They are also working with the Center for Student Engagement to bring in traffic to J Street with entertainment and student presentations.
Tim Miller, the director of the Center for Student Engagement, said he is encouraging his team to collaborate with GW’s dining services, adding that the most recent event, the annual Freshman Feast, had a record turnout of more than 900 students.
Bon Mi, which opened this fall, has been well received by customers, Haaga said. Auntie Anne’s Pretzels will open up shop later this month, marking the second major switch since the massive overhaul the year before.

Guards across campus are checking photo identification for all individuals who try to enter residence halls at night.
University Police Chief Kevin Hay said the policy is being enforced after “multiple incidents” where non-students were caught entering buildings with someone else’s GWorld.
“If a GWorld card is stolen, then we need to ensure no criminals are entering a GW facility under false pretenses,” Hay said. “It may take a few seconds longer, but we believe its worth it to ensure safety.”
He declined to comment on which halls would see added security measures or detail the specific incidents that prompted them.
Not all buildings will require photo identification, Hay said, adding the number of “documented incidents” at a hall will determine if monitors enforce the policy.
Freshman halls like Thurston Hall and Potomac House enforce the rule 24 hours a day, requiring all non-student guests to sign in.
Monitors at major residence halls like Ivory Tower, City Hall, Guthridge Hall and South Hall have since last week required photo identification eight hours a night. Buildings like Ivory Tower have seen lines of more than 40 students on weekends as guards check cards.
If a guard sees that a person does not match a GWorld picture, UPD will investigate if that card was stolen or loaned, University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said.
Visitors are already required to present identification and sign into residence halls at night if they are not affiliated with GW.
Residence Hall Association President Jacob Thayer said the photo identification policy has not been implemented in residence halls across the Mount Vernon Campus.
The University employs 90 student entrance monitors and 21 security officers in each of the two dozen residence halls.
The ID checks come a year after the University increased residence hall security to crack down on “piggybacking,” or cases of individuals following residents into buildings.
In October 2011, a man followed a group of students into The West End and allegedly punched students.

A sexual harassment and assault policy approved Friday gives accusers the protection of confidentiality, but limits the time frame within which alleged victims can bring forward a case to 180 days.
The 21-page document, approved Friday by the Faculty Senate, allows alleged victims to remain anonymous and explicitly forbids victims and offenders from mediating sexual abuses. An alleged victim can bring a case forward after the 180-day mark with “good cause,” according to the policy.
Chair of the Faculty Senate’s executive committee Michael Castleberry said the policy modernized the University’s case procedures to provide more “emotional protection” for alleged victims. The previous policy, last amended in 2005, forced complainants to disclose their identities at the formal hearing stage.
“The whole idea that a woman who has been sexually assaulted has to go in and confront the accuser hurts the healing process. The University’s code has to reflect those kinds of changes,” Castleberry said.
Deputy Title IX Coordinator Tara Pereira, who helped craft the policy over the last year, said she hopes more victims will report sexual abuses with the added emphasis on privacy.
Pereira said victims might be more comfortable coming forward if they did not fear retaliation or feel pressured to release information, though she said the anonymity could hinder the University’s ability to proceed with a hearing.
“It’s really hard to be victim survivor and go into a process where you are not in power,” Pereira said. In cases where underage drinking is involved, she added, a victim is “not likely” to face alcohol violation charges if a sexual harassment occurs – a factor she hopes will increase reports.
Three female students reported four sexual abuses on or near campus in the first two weeks of the semester. All of the situations involved alcohol.


Sexual Harassment Policy (PDF)

Sexual Harassment Policy (Text)

Department of Education data shows that nearly 20 percent of women who attend college are victims of attempted or actual sexual assaults. About 95 percent of campus rapes go unreported.
The total number of reported on-campus sex offenses reached 12 cases in 2010, the most recently available yearlong University Police Department statistics.
The policy is an interim, allowing the Faculty Senate time to revise or review the procedures before instituting permanent measures. It also spells out GW’s in-house statute of limitations for sexual assaults and sexual harassment for the first time.
The University’s procedures for reviewing allegations came under scrutiny in 2011, when a then-freshman sued GW, saying he was wrongfully found guilty of sexual assault. He alleged that the University refused to consider relevant evidence that proved him innocent. The lawsuit was settled out of court.
Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Harris Reed helped shape the interim policy over the last year, negotiating with Department of Education officials on specifics like minimum wait time for a trial to be heard. The department also called for schools to bar cases from being settled through mediation between the accused and accuser.
“That’s what every university is doing,” Reed said.  “They didn’t change the regulation, they said: This is how we’re going to evaluate you.”
A decade ago, the Faculty Senate sparred on the sexual harassment policy, voting down previous versions out of concern that professors who discuss sexual topics in class could face sanctions.
Pereira hopes the policy will help increase reporting numbers for a crime she called the most under-reported in the world.
“The policies are clearer, the resources are clearer and there are more people with their eyes directly on this type of issue,” Pereira said.
Senior Yasemin Ayarci said she was frustrated by the University’s GW Today statement that tied sexual harassment to alcohol but was pleased to see the interim policy taking a stronger stance on sexual harassment prevention and accountability.
“It definitely looks great on paper, but I want to see the policy laid out in action,” said Ayarci, who co-hosted a sexual harassment awareness event Sept. 12. “I hope GW takes a larger emphasis on educating college students on sexual harassment and violence.”

Many teams look back after a loss and wish they could have presented a more offense-oriented, aggressive attack from the first whistle.
For the Colonials (3-3), a lack of urgency doomed their chances of taking down non-conference opponent Bryant University this weekend. Despite one late goal, GW’s overall effort was not enough to overcome the Bulldogs’ two second-half scores.
Although the Colonials carried momentum from a previous victory into Sunday’s match, head coach Craig Jones said his team failed to capitalize on that advantage.
“Obviously we were coming off a good win, so the confidence was high. But we knew it was going to be difficult playing Bryant at Bryant,” he said. “Unfortunately we didn’t play as well as we could have. When you turn the ball over as much as we did, you can’t get into any kind of rhythm, and you keep giving it back to the opposition.”
Turnovers aside, GW only produced one shot on goal in the first half and won only one corner kick in the entire match. Bryant, on the contrary, produced eight shots on goal before the 45th minute and strung together eight corner kicks on the day.
The Colonials’ inability to put shots on net is a statistic that Jones could easily point to when dissecting the reasons for the loss.
“We get into good positions, but for whatever reason right now, we are reluctant to pull the trigger. Until we start doing that, we’re not going to score the goals that we should be scoring,” Jones said.
In the second half, GW’s defense could not withstand Bryant’s offensive push. Despite three saves by redshirt freshman JP van der Merwe in the period, two out of the Bulldogs’ eight shots found the back of the Colonials’ net.
The blows came within five minutes of one another, continuing GW’s trend of allowing goals in bunches this year. At the D.C. College Cup game against George Mason earlier in the month, the Colonials yielded three goals to the opposition in the first 24 minutes of play.
Though he said the whole team was responsible for the goals allowed in the game against Bryant, Jones also said the battle for No. 1 goalkeeper has not yet been won.
“There’s still a competition for places there,” Jones said. “We have the options to change things if we think that’s the best thing for the group. And obviously we’ll make that by the end of the week going into the next game.”
For now though, Jones’ emphasis during practice will be double-edged. First on the list is helping his team recognize when to go for the goal. In their three losses this season, the Colonials have averaged less than one goal per game.
On the other end of the pitch, Jones is hopeful that his players can tighten up their defense and prevent the type of easy shot opportunities that have been abundant for GW opponents this season.
“Unfortunately there’s a [recurring] theme in terms of us keeping possession and quality in the final third. Defensively we need to be a little bit stronger so we don’t concede cheap goals,” he said.
More than anything though, Jones hopes his team will have more confidence in its offensive capabilities, because as Bryant proved on Sunday, the more goals you go for, the more goals you will score.
“The stats don’t lie. When you take as few shots as we did, certainly in the first half, it’s all relative,” Jones said. “If you don’t shoot, you don’t score. If you don’t score, you don’t win.”
The Colonials will host the UMBC Retrievers Saturday.

When Barack Obama ran for president in 2008, he knew he had the support of young voters.
But this time around, voters seem to have lost their enthusiasm, and the president must prove to college students – who turned out in droves to support him last time – that in his second term he will take tangible steps to address mounting tuition costs and the looming student debt crisis.
College-aged supporters who voted and campaigned for Obama four years ago have now graduated college and have attempted to navigate the job market during the economic downturn. Student debt is a very real concern, especially at GW, where the average student graduated with $32,500 in debt in 2010, according to the Project on Student Debt.
In his speech at the Democratic National Convention, the president identified the problem facing students but offered little about how he would fix it.
“Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next 10 years,” he said.
He added, “I don’t believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China.”
The president is right to point out the difficulties facing young people, and he is right that we need to work to be more competitive internationally. But then again, he fails to outline any practical solutions for these national issues.
Similarly, earlier this year, he described a plan to withhold federal funding from universities that are not working to curb tuition costs and that don’t meet certain requirements like job placement. As nice as it sounded, it lacked the necessary details and figures that would reassure voters in a consistently gridlocked political climate.
Last spring, Obama urged students to call Congress to keep the Stafford Loan rates from doubling. It was an admirable step to enact policies to support his views on education. Students need to see more of that.
As young people, we are tired of campaign promises. We want to hear real policy plans. And we want answers. What specifically can be done about the state of tuition costs? How will you solve the student debt crisis? What will you do to jumpstart the economy and job market to ease our job searches?
College students are tired of promises of hope and change. And while these speeches help fuel the 24-hour news cycle, they lack substance.
The president’s problem is not that young voters do not support him. A Gallup poll released Sept. 9 from earlier this month put Obama ahead by 59 to 33 percent among young voters.
But Obama is still facing an uphill battle. It is not that young voters have turned their backs on the president, but rather that getting them to vote on election day will likely prove more difficult this election year.
Young voters, who are notorious for low turnout, are predicted to have an especially weak year. The same Gallup poll in September showed that only 62 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 say they’re “definitely voting,” 18 points below the national percentage of definite voters. Here’s the bottom line: If Obama wants the support from our demographic that he had in the last election, he’s going to have to get more specific when it comes to issues like student debt, tuition and the state of the economy. This time around, policy, not rhetoric, will bring young voters to the polls.

The women’s soccer team’s season can not yet be defined.
The Colonials (3-4) are aware of their struggles on offense and their overall record, but they are waiting for conference play to put a label on their year.
“Despite our current record, we’ve come a long way and made many improvements since pre-season,” freshman goalkeeper Nicole Fasano said. “We’ve dealt with a lot of injuries, but the team has come together, and we’ll only progress further.”
GW faced off against Liberty in their final game before the start of a five-match home stand. For the second-straight match, The Colonials could not find the back of the net, and Liberty seized the lead with a goal early on, in the second half of play. Unable to respond, GW was left with its second straight 1-0 loss.
Seven of the Colonials’ 10 shots in the game were on target.
Liberty dominated GW in corner kicks, with 11 attempts compared to GW’s two. The disparity allowed Liberty to control time of possession and continuously keep the ball away from their own goal.
“We created enough chances to score a goal tonight, and that shows we’re becoming a more dangerous team,” head coach Sarah Barnes said. “However, we need to focus our efforts on being composed to keep the ball and make good decisions under pressure and, ultimately, finish the opportunities we create.”
The Colonials next return home to begin their five-match home stand, but those five games have differing levels of weight. The first two matches of the home stand are against local rivals American and Howard – crucial for neighborhood bragging rights – while the final three comprise the beginning of GW’s A-10 conference schedule.
“These next two games, our focus will be on decision making in the attack and finishing, which will both be important for conference play,” Barnes said. “We want to gather momentum heading into conference, so these next two games offer a great opportunity for us to continue to improve.”
The Colonials are 2-0 at home this season. Their upcoming five-match home stand offers the opportunity to improve a win-loss record, though Barnes has said for the entire season that her team is better than their record shows.
“There are many aspects we’ll evaluate when determining the success of the team, including our ability to be competitive,” Barnes said. “The quality of opponents will be more challenging heading into conference, and we feel that we’re a better team with every game we play, so we’re excited for the challenges that are ahead.”
The Colonials will host American at 4 p.m. Tuesday and Howard at 4 p.m. Friday.

Growing up in the suburbs, there are some things about city life that I just don’t get.
Take food trucks, for example. I simply don’t understand the appeal of eating food cooked and sold from a vehicle.
So I was surprised to learn when I came here that food trucks are all the rage in the District. I know people who blog about their food truck experiences. I have friends who tweet at food trucks’ Twitter feeds. I’ve even heard of people who plan their meals around when CapMac or Tasty Kabob will be on campus. For many students here, the food trucks that frequent H Street are a cornerstone of their college diets.
But food trucks – with the exception of Kababji D.C. – are not on the GWorld system even though they want to be. And to better accommodate students’ dining needs, this is something that the University should work to change.
Food is a sizeable expense, and for underclassmen, paying for meals at venues that do not accept Colonial Cash is always a burden. Having food trucks accept GWorld would not only be lucrative for the food truck owners, who would undoubtedly get more business, but more importantly would benefit students who are looking for options that don’t require swiping a credit card or forking over hard-earned cash.
As it stands, many students rely on GWorld to pay for most of their meals, and carrying cash around is an extra effort.
For many students, the meal plan can be restrictive. Most freshmen, sophomores and juniors are required to pay approximately $1,000 in Colonial Cash per semester. It would do the University well to offer as many venues as possible where students could spend that money.
Despite the University’s repeated attempts year after year to renovate J Street and make it more attractive, the reality is, the dining hall is still largely unpopular among students, especially upperclassmen. Instead, it seems as though the Whole Foods on I Street has become the unofficial University cafeteria, with crowds of students congregating there at each meal time.
But when students spend money at Whole Foods, they’re using their prepaid Colonial Cash. They don’t have to pay out of their own pockets. Having food trucks on GWorld would be another welcome alternative that is affordable to students who rely on the meal plan to pay for their food.
The University needs to recognize that the meal plan at GW is vastly different than those of other schools with traditional dining halls. And while J Street does function as a cafeteria, we’re lucky to have the freedom to eat at various other venues that Colonial Cash allows.
Just because students are lucky enough to have more than one dining venue does not mean the University should hesitate to add popular food options like food trucks to the GWorld system. The University should recognize the benefits of our central location in the District and provide students with the opportunity to take advantage of its varied dining choices.
Whole Foods is great, but you can only eat there so many times a day.
