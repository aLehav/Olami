Book fast to get a ticket to Austin for spring break. People from all over will flood Austin for the South by Southwest music festival. And Austin won’t let you down. With plenty of restaurants, a fun bar scene, shopping and warm temperatures, you’ll have more to enjoy than just the SXSW scene.
The cheapest way to get from D.C. to Austin requires a connecting flight, but even with the layover, it will only take you about five hours to kick off your Texan spring break. The cost for a Delta flight (leaving March 11 and returning March 16) is $259.
Many hotels in Austin are already completely booked due to the influx of music-lovers attending SXSW. However, you can still book a four-person room at the Super 8 Hotel near the Austin Convention Center, where you’ll be close to all the SXSW action. For a four-person room, six days will cost $316 per person.
SXSW, which takes place at Austin’s Convention Center, offers a massive, weeklong lineup of concerts, film screenings and more. Hundreds of musical acts play each year, and this year’s lineup includes many up-and-coming bands, as well as bigger names like Vampire Weekend and Tegan and Sarah. A music badge is $750 if you buy now, but the price will bump up to $795 by Feb. 8. Austin’s nightlife is also worth exploring if the music festival doesn’t tire you out. The Sixth Street district in downtown Austin transforms into one giant party on weekend nights, when traffic is blocked off and wild bar hopping takes over the streets.
When you need relief from the heat, check out Amy’s Ice Creams. This chain has locations all over Austin and serves up eclectic flavors like honey, bourbon custard, Mexican vanilla and pecan pie a la mode.
You can’t leave Austin without some Tex-Mex, and there are plenty of places to get your fill. Polvos Mexican Restaurant boasts its own salsa bar, and Kirby Lane Café has eateries scattered across the city.

A student pays tuition and can live in a residence hall, buy food at campus dining halls and go to Student Health Service through the duration of his or her GW career.
But if the University’s new sexual assault policy is to take effect, after a year and a half, a student cannot report a sexual assault. After one and a half years, a victim’s problems are no longer GW’s concerns.
Or at least that’s the message the University is sending with the planned one-and-a-half-year statute of limitations for reporting a sexual assault.
When the University released its plans for a new sexual assault policy in September, it included an arbitrary and reprehensible 180-day window during which students could file charges against alleged offenders.
An administrator said that time frame may be extended to a year and a half, which is just as distressing. The University cannot tell a victim when to feel ready to come forward after such a traumatic incident.
These statutes of limitations are troubling and discouraging.
Sexual assault is a notoriously underreported crime on college campuses. Eleven GW students reported sexual assault in 2010, and 16 reported in 2011, according to the Department of Education statistics. Taking into account that federal studies estimate nearly 20 percent of college women are victims of actual or attempted sexual assault, these numbers are startlingly low.
And while students always have the option to report cases of sexual assault to D.C. authorities, they should be able to bring forward sexual assault cases during the duration of their time at the University.
When a student has been sexually assaulted, it can be years before he or she even feels comfortable telling anyone or asking for help. A year and a half will be no better than 180 days.
Under this new policy, more reports could fall through the cracks. Students need a message of unconditional support, but even a year-and-a-half window for reporting a sexual assault fails to offer that and still serves as a deterrence.
A year and a half, two, three or even four years later, these instances are ingrained in an affected individual’s memory. The editorial board considers it insulting that the University would force students to abide by a rule within an arbitrary time frame.
This editorial was updated on Feb. 4, 2013 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet originally stated that the University released plans for its sexual assault policy, which included a 180-day statute of limitations, in October. The plans were released in September. We regret this error.

As someone who has been semi-regularly going to the gym for the past two weeks, one thing about the Lerner Health and Wellness Center has consistently stood out to me – and it’s not the steep price of a pass to take weekly Hip Hop HUSTLE classes.
It’s the gym’s seemingly arbitrary hours.
You’d think the gym would be open often enough to be useful to students, many of whom work or intern on top of classes. Yet it stays open on weekend evenings when most students are anywhere but the gym.
Mondays through Fridays, the gym stays open from 6:30 a.m. until 11:30 p.m. It opens a little later on Saturdays, at 9 a.m., but closes earlier at 8 p.m.
The gym opens much later on Sundays, at 11 a.m., and shuts its doors at 11:30 p.m.
The University should look into closing the gym earlier on Fridays and Saturdays, and keeping it open later in the week and earlier on Sundays.
If we lived in a perfect world, Lerner would be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week and we would all have the power of flight. But our world is, of course, far from perfect.
And Lerner’s hours for most of the workweek make a lot of sense. But I’m not shocking anyone when I say that a typical Monday for students is not the same as a typical Friday. The gym hours on these two days should change to reflect that.
I’m not the only one to notice this issue. Over the past few months, the Student Association has been working on making the gym more accessible. There have been “several meetings between students and administrators” regarding Lerner’s hours, according to Associate Athletic Director for Health and Wellness Andre Julien.
But SA President Ashwin Narla told me that the reason meetings haven’t resulted in significant change thus far is because financial costs of maintaining a 24-hour gym are too expensive.
And making the gym stay open longer is also out of the question: “We just don’t see the demand in terms of actual users to extend the hours,” Julien told me in an email.
Lerner sees some of its slowest periods during Friday and Saturday evenings, Narla said – when students are out partying and socializing with friends, and the last thing on their mind is a treadmill.
So here’s a solution: Lerner could close earlier during the weekends, so that those hours can be shifted to periods when students are more likely to want to workout during the week.
Especially during these cold winter months, those who are itching for a weekday midnight run are either forced to brave the weather, or forget about getting exercise. But working out late into the evenings or in the mornings isn’t a possibility right now when Lerner closes at 11:30 p.m. on the weekdays and opens at 11 a.m. on Sundays.
Monday is the busiest day at the gym, often seeing up to 2,700 students. Hours subtracted from weekend evenings should be shifted to later in the night during the workweek, to further accommodate the busy lives of students – including those who work at the gym.
These changes would make sense, given that oftentimes on Friday and Saturday nights, fewer than five students use the gym in the couple of hours before closing, according to Narla.
If the University wants students to go to Lerner, it should probably be open when students aren’t at a frat party.

“Play for pay.”
That phrase has haunted the NCAA as it struggles to justify the current system of money in college athletics. But it now appears that the question is no longer if some athletes will receive compensation, but where the money will come from.
With multi-billion dollar TV contracts and merchandising money that never makes it into the wallets of the athletes who play on these teams in the first place, some argue that the NCAA cannot continue to pretend that college sports are amateur athletics.
Take a school like the University of Florida, which had over $70 million in combined basketball and football revenue in 2009-2010. Yet even with scholarships, many on- and off-campus athletes were still living $2,250 below the poverty line, according to the National College Players Association.
And after a federal court judge ruled Jan. 30 that the NCAA couldn’t block college football or men’s basketball players from claiming a portion of TV revenue, accompanied by renewed talk of stipends for athletes, the dialogue around the “play for pay” debate has shifted.
While admittedly flawed, taking money from TV deals is the best option for college players. It would be an additional form of revenue that wouldn’t necessarily detract from universities’ academic budgets. But in reality, compensating athletes beyond scholarship money might only further complicate the world of college athletics.
College athletes are worth a lot of money. The PAC-12 conference recently just signed a TV deal that is worth at least $225 million over 12 years, which students won’t even receive. Even at a smaller, less prestigious conference like the A-10, the same principle still applies in that any revenue the school receives from its athletic program won’t make it directly into the hands of athletes.
The NCAA is considering providing a $2,000 stipend for some athletes on top of any financial aid money they may receive. But to make this possible, that money would have to come from athletic departments themselves – few of which are even profitable – and would only create more competition amongst colleges to attract top recruits. This would inevitably siphon resources from other parts of universities, such as academic programs, and could skew the priorities of otherwise prestigious institutions.
While the NCAA’s stipend plan may be implemented through a need-based system, this move potentially limits access to federal financial aid money, thereby not actually putting more money in the pockets of students, according to a Jan. 6 article in NPR.
That’s why paying players through TV deals is the best option. It would address the root of the problem – which is that athletes aren’t receiving the portion of revenue they help to create – and wouldn’t have a direct effect on academic budgets.
But even this plan has its problems. It doesn’t seem fair for men’s basketball and football players to get paid while other student athletes who don’t produce millions of dollars of revenue may be left without checks. Students in high-profile collegiate sports aren’t the only ones living below the poverty line – other athletes could use the money, too.
And conferences like the A-10 that don’t have large TV contracts, don’t have the revenue to pay athletes as much as other schools. If this were the case, then we would have athletes matriculating to universities for no other reason than the institution being the highest bidder.
College athletics are built on a flawed system that is bound to change in the near future. But before any significant changes are made, we have to be careful not to make an already unjust system even more inequitable.

As an international affairs major, I’m required to take one to two science classes. And I know I’m not the only one who zones out when my professor starts talking about isotopes and the periodic table of elements.
But students aren’t alone. Professors have also begun to realize that traditional lectures are not as effective as they should be.
This discovery has been especially salient in the STEM fields – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – arguably the most academically challenging and rigorous departments in any university, in which 63 percent of professors use lectures as an integral part of their classroom, according to an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education from October 2012.
But there’s a new class model that takes a less traditional approach: Students sit in small groups at tables and collaborate on problems, forcing them to actually participate.
Universities across the country – including GW – have started implementing these classes, known as SCALE-UP courses.
Traditionally, there has been an unspoken understanding that professors do the work in class by lecturing, and students wait until after class to prepare for exams and complete problem sets.
I enrolled in two SCALE-UP science classes my freshman year, and it was frustrating at first because it wasn’t possible to hide in the back row taking less than stellar notes. I realized quickly that I had to actually learn the material before class so I could participate effectively.
And while these classes might require more work, the positive returns are greater as well. Physics professor William Briscoe told The Hatchet in 2011 that the average grade on the first test of the semester was 10 percent higher than those from previous years. And a 2007 study by Professor Robert J. Beichner showed that “in comparison to traditional instruction, significant increases have been shown in conceptual understanding… [and] success rates.”
A large portion of each SCALE-UP class is devoted to group activities. Group work can be frustrating: Not everyone helps, you sometimes feel lost and there’s always one kid blazing ahead of everyone else. As a result, it means you suffer when someone nearby is falling asleep or surfing Facebook.
On top of that, students must answer questions from peers and the professor, solve math problems and make presentations regularly.
When the professor put up a word problem on the screen and asked us to make a calculation, you could see the panic in the students’ eyes. “Where did that problem come from?” they whispered.
But when I look back on it, I realize that the point of the classes was to leave students to grapple with the material on their own. If it were easy, then there would be no point in taking the class in the first place.
Did I feel frustrated? Absolutely. But once I began to put in a little more effort preparing for class, I was able to excel. Students just aren’t accustomed to doing that much work in a general curriculum class.
The easy solution? Come to class prepared.
This might mean skimming over material the night before, grabbing coffee to keep your eyes open or even putting your phone away for the duration of class. But you’ll benefit, and so will your classmates.
So before you judge the SCALE-UP approach, give it a chance and put effort into class time. You might be surprised at  how good you get at chemistry.

Two student entrepreneurs are leading a new cycle.
Matt Wilkins, a dean’s fellow and first-year graduate student in the School of Engineering was part of a winning Clinton Global Initiative University team last year, when he and two partners created a sustainable bamboo bicycle.
Ten months later, he and 2012 alumnus Chris Deschenes have morphed their brainchild, Panda Cycles, into an organization called Pedal Forward – a bike-sharing program in cities that lack the cycling infrastructure in D.C.
A lifelong cyclist, Wilkins initially sought to create a bike that could help the world.
“I saw online that people built bikes out of bamboo, and I said, ‘I have bamboo in my backyard,’ ” Wilkins said. “I went home to New York and cut down some bamboo in my backyard and built a bike.”
Like the bike-share system Capital Bikeshare, users will pay to use a bike for an allotted period of time. Pedal Forward bikes will include built-in locks and GPS tracking devices, and users can find the nearest available bike using a mobile app.
Deschenes said the purpose of the bamboo bicycles is to serve the planet and people, as well as promote conversation about sustainability.
After meeting Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory in April while dining at President Knapp’s home as part of a Planet Forward symposium, they decided to take the bike-share program to the city, which has struggled to improve its transit system.
Wilkins pitched the idea to the mayor and plans to bring Pedal Forward to Cincinnati in two years.
“Bamboo bikes sort of put a light bulb in [Mallory’s] head, saying more bikes in the city is good, and bamboo bikes represent this green, sustainable idea that is a part of his platform,” Wilkins said.
Pedal Forward will donate a percentage of the revenue sales from their bike-sharing business to their charity of choice, Bicycles Against Poverty.
Bicycles Against Poverty primarily operates in Africa and loans bikes to farmers and entrepreneurs in countries including Uganda. Small business owners pay for the bikes incrementally.
“There’s really just no downside transitioning from a car to a bicycle, especially in urban areas,” Deschenes said. “With this in mind, we’d like to continue our original CGIU commitment, as well as develop what we believe to be a more efficient and effective bike-sharing system.”
They have also teamed with fellow Clinton Global Initiative University participant Marisa Ranieri, a 2012 alumna currently teaching English in Tanzania. A fundraising effort on Pedal Forward’s website will raise money for the Tumaini Fund, which distributes bikes to Tanzanian orphans. So far, sales have raised enough money for 29 bikes.
Ranieri said she met Wilkins at the CGIU conference when they were seniors last year. Intrigued by each others’ projects, the two saw an opportunity to join forces.
“When I learned that a non-profit organization in the area, the Tumaini Fund, donated bicycles to AIDS-affected orphans in the area where I live and work, I knew I’d found the missing link,” Ranieri said in an email.
Wilkins will travel to Tanzania and stay with Ranieri in March to distribute the bicycles.
He said he hopes Pedal Forward can expand its bike-share business in the next five years, building up a biking community in cities not yet converted to the eco- and health-friendly form of transportation.

The Bar Bro brings you the best dives in the District. He isn’t classless – just low-class.
DCist published an article called “The Dive is Dead, and We Killed It” about two weeks ago. My first reaction was dismissive. I had held one end of a table up with my knee at Dan’s Café and drank beers for a quarter at McNasty’s. Surely, the bathroom alone at Dan’s qualified it as a legitimate dive.
But as I read further and began to reconsider my drinking experiences in the District, I came to grips with the main thesis.
“We’re not looking for a true dive,” the article said. “We’re looking for the invented nostalgia of the idea a dive conveys but watered down for the masses.”
That’s right. Look up any list of D.C.’s best dives and you’ll find a number of dimly-lit bars in rough (but rapidly gentrifying) neighborhoods that offer cheap canned beer alongside $8 drafts of craft brew.
Essentially, they’re places where well-to-do people can slum for a while without leaving the safety and familiar comfort of their locally brewed IPA.
So last Friday I went to The Looking Glass Lounge, just a block from the Georgia Ave-Petworth Metro stop, with a good idea of what I was in for. It was freezing outside, and the bar greeted my friends and me warmly. It’s cozy without being too cramped. If you follow the mish-mashed chandeliers to the back of the bar, past the exposed brick walls adorned with old promotional mirrors and original artwork, you’ll find that every table in the bar is filled with diners, drinkers and hipsters. There’s a band set-up in the back, and even though no one was playing live that night, the music was loud and hip, and people standing in the space between the bar and the tables danced and chatted intermittently.
We decided to head downstairs, where, past the open kitchen, lies a smaller, chiller scene. It seemed less deliberately cool, with watercolor paintings of tigers hanging behind the bar, and a quieter, old-school hip-hop soundtrack playing over the speakers. After waiting around for about 10 minutes – and lamenting that it was too cold to sit out on the biergarten-esque patio – although it was open to smokers – we grabbed a table in the corner and ordered food and drinks.
The food is standard D.C. pub fare. I had a chili-cheese half-smoke ($6.50), which always seems to live up to its reputation as the best drunk food in the District. I found it odd that vegetarian chili was an option on top of a hot dog, but to each his own. As it were, my dog came out topped with hearty chili and a thick helping of Cheez Whiz, which, as anyone from Philly will tell you, is the only form of cheese that belongs on a greasy bar sandwich. I sampled a few plates around the table – a Reuben ($9.75), some fries ($4) – and everything was genuinely satisfying.
For drinks, we decided to start with good beer before moving on to the cheaper stuff, which in my home state of New Jersey has always meant a Yuengling before a case of Keystone, but I digress. The Looking Glass Lounge has a good selection of beers on tap, all ranging from $7-9. The highlights were the Traveling Mustache Shandy, which was fresh and fruity, and the Chocolate City Cerveza Nacional, which tasted like easy-drinking Irish coffee. Still, I can’t abide a $7 drink, and opted instead to finish the night cruising on $6 boilermakers – a shot of Jim Beam chased with a can of Natty Boh. Quick, easy and to the point.
In the end, a good, drunk time was had by all. But I couldn’t help looking around and thinking about the death of the dive bar. The Looking Glass Lounge has a dartboard – behind the bar. Everything in the bar – the music, the décor, the bartenders – is delivered in a package of premeditated hipness. This is a dive column. And for a bar to qualify, it must offer a drink for $3 during primetime. In that sense, the Looking Glass Lounge qualifies.
If you stick with the shot-and-a-beer combo, you can have a pretty cheap, fun night. And that’s what the Bar Bro stands for: bars that are cheap and fun.
But I feel that I owe my readers a divier experience than this. The dive bar may be dying in this city, but somehow, I refuse to believe that it has gone completely extinct. There are bars in this city that don’t have websites and snarky Yelp reviews, and I will try my best to find them for you. Until then, have fun. Go to places like this. And if drinking for cheap means drinking PBRs next to bearded white guys wearing Wu Tang T-shirts, then so be it.
If DCist is right, it’s kind of what we all want anyway.

With three minutes and 51 seconds left to play, senior forward Isaiah Armwood rose up at the top of the key and drained his first three-pointer of the season. No less than 45 seconds later, from the same spot at the top of the key, he drained his second. It was a now a five-point game.
Unfortunately, for the rest of the Colonials squad, that was as close as they would get. A 4-0 La Salle run immediately following the baskets extended the lead back to nine, silencing the hard-fought comeback. It was a comeback that saw the Colonials go on an 18-3 run after being down by 20 points, but ultimately fall short, losing 80-71.
“We got it down to five with at least two and a half minutes left,” head coach Mike Lonergan said. “I think we just got a little too excited there and didn’t play solid defense.”
Besides a late surge in the second half, the rest of the game showed few signs of success for GW (10-10, 4-3 A-10). The Colonials looked lost on both ends of the floor during much of the first half, and the Explorers made them pay.
Coming in as one of the best three-point shooting teams in the conference, ranking sixth in the A-10, La Salle easily lived up to its reputation. Neither the Colonials’ man nor zone defenses could freeze the Explorers’ hot hands as they went on to shoot 50 percent from behind the arc in the first.
“They spread us out, and then when we switched defenses they hit some really big threes when they needed them,” Lonergan said.
Possession after possession, the Explorers found an open D.J. Peterson or Tyreek Duren in the corner, and possession after possession, they nailed wide-open threes. Peterson, who led all scorers at the half with 12 points, shot 4-for-5 from three in the first, already eclipsing his career high for three pointers in a game. At one point in the first half, with six minutes and 51 seconds left to play, La Salle had more three-point field goals, seven, than the Colonials had overall, six.
Further constraining GW’s inability to get out on shooters was the shake-up in La Salle’s starting line-up. Opting not to go with his usual four-guard lineup, head coach Dr. John Giannini started center Steve Zack. Likely put in to disrupt Colonial duo Armwood and freshman forward Kevin Larsen, Zack was most effective at the top of the key, moving in and out of screens for the Explorer guards – disrupting the coverage of the Colonial defenders.
On offense, the Colonials were just as confused, throwing passes out of bounds and committing 10 turnovers that led to 16 points for La Salle in the first half. By comparison, GW had zero points off of turnovers at the break.
“I give them credit. Their switching defense hurt us,” Lonergan said. “We got the ball inside, and they did a good job digging in, and we turned it over a lot. Just looking at the stat sheet, that really hurt us.”
At the start of the second half, it looked to be more of the same for the Colonials, as they continued to look overmatched against a quicker and more experienced team. But then the comeback began.
GW stepped up its intensity, matching the Explorers’ speed on defense and getting out in transition. The Colonials stepped into a full-court press on defense, repaying the Explorers for the high number of turnovers they had forced, and clawing their way back into the game. With the guards still unable to create anything off the dribble though, GW was forced to change gears.
“I just said we had to play more aggressive because they were switching everything,” Lonergan said.  “And they’re all guards, so we really don’t have that guy that can beat a guy off the dribble against a player like they had, so we just had to rely on being aggressive in transition.”
Even more aggressive was Lonergan’s decision to draw up some outside plays for his big men – specifically Armwood. Looking to create mismatches at the top of the key and hopefully drive to the basket, it was certainly unexpected for Armwood to rainbow in two treys.
“If I get it and I’m open, I’m gonna shoot it,” Armwood said. “But Coach Lonergan designed the play for me to step back and knock it down, so I just shot it.”
But the surprise buckets couldn’t make up for GW’s sloppy first half, as La Salle stayed poised with time running out. Down the stretch, the Explorers hit their last six free throws, going 17-19 on the game, highlighted by perfect 10-10 shooting from the line by guard Ramon Galloway.
Armwood led the way for GW with 17 points and nine rebounds, while senior forward Dwayne Smith and freshman guard Patricio Garino both added 11 points. Overall, the Colonials controlled the paint, garnering a 38-22 advantage, but the 24-6 points off of turnover margin ultimately set the two teams apart.
The loss especially hurt for the Colonials as their recent three-game winning streak and potent starting lineup was speculated to have produced a revitalized GW roster.
“It was kind of like we reverted back to our old ways,” Lonergan said.

Correction appended
While hashtags and tweets seem to disappear amid the endless torrent of Twitter conversations, the staff at Gelman Library is preserving them for history.
Laura Wrubel and Daniel Chudnov, who help run the library’s technology arm, developed a tool, now in its early stages, that gathers data from Twitter to simplify social media research for GW professors.
“The data is amazing. A lot of people look at it and think, ‘Why do we need a record of millions of people telling us what they had for lunch?’ But it’s a lot more than just that,” Chudnov, Gelman’s director of scholarly technology, said. “It’s a wealth of material that people will study for years and years and years.”
Chudnov has led the project since coming to GW in fall 2011 after working as the lead developer on the Library of Congress’ own Twitter archiving initiative – an effort that dwarfs GW’s project by creating an archive of hundreds of billions of public tweets. GW’s web-based software package stores specific Twitter handles or keywords that researchers are studying, which they can then transfer to analysis tools such as Excel.
By preserving election tweets or hashtags like #BindersFullOfWomen, the librarians are able to catch them before they get lost amid a cacophony of conversations.
Before, Chudnov said, researchers and graduate students studying study topics like the tweeting patterns of politicians or media organizations had to sort tweets by hand and enter them into Excel. Because Twitter doesn’t allow access to its historical data, researchers had to shell out thousands of dollars to private vendors to access archived tweets.
“When I heard that, I thought, ‘We can do better than that,’ ” Chudnov said. “One of the goals of librarians is to save you time. There’s no reason students and faculty members researching social media should have to do this work by hand.”
Albert May, an associate professor of media and public affairs, said he plans to use the software in his digital reporting class this semester and for his research on how Congress uses social media.
“The potential is significant,” May said. “The University has taken a significant step in creating a programming team within library services to assist researchers, who often do not have access to such technical support.”
The work is part of the library’s build-up as a digital research center – not just a paper book warehouse. The digitally focused staff Chudnov helps lead only started to take shape five years ago.
This project jumps off the growing number of researchers studying social media, as almost 5,000 theses and dissertations nationally have referenced Twitter in the last two years, according to the librarians’ research.
“It started out as a prototype, but we know this is where libraries need to go. It makes sense for libraries to support this kind of research,” Wrubel said.
Next on the project agenda is archiving tweets related to GW, a school recognized for the heavy tweeting habits of its students, professors and administrators.
Chudnov said his team is working with the University archivist to preserve tweets from accounts like @GWtweets, @GWCollegeDems and @gwhatchet for history.
“By starting to collect this now, we’ll be able to provide a service that few other university archives can,” Chudnov said. “They’re are all fair game for University archiving.”
The staff is trying to grow the software by spreading the word to researchers studying social media, not only in journalism, but also in economics, psychology and linguistics, Wrubel said. The staff has not yet determined how many professors overall would use this tool, she added.
With this technological initiative, everything released by the library will be open-source, meaning it won’t be closed off behind GW’s digital wall, but rather be open to everyone. The Twitter data collection software is available on the sharing website GitHub.
“You have to give back to the community, to academia and to the whole world, because when you do everything internally and you don’t release it, it’s a waste of money,” Karim Boughida, associate University librarian for digital initiatives and content management, said.

Due to an editing error, The Hatchet incorrectly reported that professor Albert May studies how professors use social media. He actually studies how Congress uses social media.
