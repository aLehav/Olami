From go-go music to mambo sauce and early blooming cherry blossoms, plenty of things set D.C. apart from the rest of the continental U.S. There are even our license plates that proclaim “end taxation without representation.” The maxim reflects the problem dogging the District’s government – living in the nation’s capital has plenty of perks, but its lack of full local control isn’t one of them.
Federal lawmakers atop Capitol Hill delivered a stern reminder of the limitations on the city’s ability to govern itself earlier this month when the U.S. House of Representatives voted to reject D.C.’s revised criminal code and strike down a bill allowing noncitizens to vote in local D.C. elections. The Senate will vote on the resolutions nullifying the city’s legislation in March, and President Joe Biden can either sign or veto them if they pass the Senate.
Though you won’t hear about it during a guided tour, congressional oversight of D.C.’s government as outlined in the Constitution makes the District one of a kind. The 1973 Home Rule Act – or home rule, for short – transferred power from the president and their appointees who governed the city to a locally elected mayor and the D.C. Council. But home rule still has its limits. Congressional review of the city’s legislation and control over its budget remains in place, meaning any proposals that emerge from the Wilson Building have to endure a grueling examination and political grandstanding on Capitol Hill.
But before Congress intervened, the D.C. Council didn’t update the city’s century-old criminal code and pass the Local Voting Rights Amendment Act without controversy. Mayor Muriel Bowser opposed revising the criminal code – which wouldn’t come into effect until October 2025 – and vetoed the overhaul before the D.C. Council overrode her 12-1. And while D.C. has a large immigrant population, some city residents and members of Congress believe the right to vote in all elections should be reserved for citizens.
But federal officials have no business getting involved with the District’s affairs. Congress should value the principle of self-government over the specifics of the policies it scrutinizes, yet Republican members of the House and the dozens of Democrats who joined them are socking the city’s democracy in the face for the sake of schadenfreude. These naysaying politicians may be fulfilling their constitutional obligation to review D.C.’s laws, but they don’t represent the District, its people or their interests.
Members of Congress whose constituents live anywhere but in the District itself are acting as if they know what’s best for D.C. And that’s not for the first time, either. Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., has expressed support for repealing home rule together, while Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., blocked the District from legalizing the sale of marijuana in 2015. Clyde, Harris and the rest of their ilk have their own districts where they can try out these archaic, reckless policies. But in flexing their unchecked power over D.C. to score points with their constituents, they’re following in the footsteps of white supremacist politicians who yearned to keep D.C. segregated in the 1930s and 1940s. In historically majority-Black D.C., it’s impossible to hear patronizing calls to keep the District in line as anything other than a screeching dog whistle.
Worse still, there’s no unified strategy among the District’s leaders to stand up to congressional overreach. Bowser implored senators to keep their hands off D.C. in a tweet Thursday and demanded members of Congress “leave us alone” after the House vote – not exactly a valiant defense of democracy. And shadow Sen. Mike Brown, whose position exists to advocate for D.C. statehood, shifted the blame onto the city itself. The D.C. Council acted like a “petulant child” for sending legislation allowing noncitizens to vote before a conservative, Republican-led House, he told Axios earlier this month.
Regardless of how everyone from everyday citizens up to the mayor herself feels about these bills, members of the District don’t need Congress telling them what to do. And whether they’re only here for four years or plan to make the District their home, GW students have a distinct ability and responsibility to advocate for the city’s right to self-government at the most politically active campus in the U.S.
The House vote made clear that the fate of D.C.’s laws is a national issue. GW students from elsewhere in the U.S. enjoy the simultaneous benefit of living in D.C. and receiving democratic representation in our home states. So let’s put democracy to good use on behalf of the city we call home.
If you believe in a D.C. governed by and for the people, pressure your members of Congress back home to support that vision, too. Find out how your representative voted and contact your senator before the Senate votes to nullify the District’s laws in March. Where do they stand on home rule? Would they support D.C. statehood, which would avoid the issue of congressional review altogether?
Democracy is imperfect – it can produce unpopular and controversial policies that may not stand the test of time. But it’s a far better alternative to the unelected dictatorship looming over D.C. We’re fortunate to study, live, learn and work here. Whether you’re a catalyst for change or sentinel of self-government, help ensure the District’s future belongs to the people who live here instead of 435 politicians they didn’t vote for.

The removal of an encampment of more than 50 unhoused people from McPherson Square earlier this month is the latest in a series of encampment clearings showcasing the District’s and federal government’s inhumane approach to homelessness during the pandemic. The McPherson Square removal follows similar clearings at Union Station this past June and across the city in 2021. With shelters nearing capacity and residents barred from “no-tent zones” in areas like parks and underpasses, do the city’s leaders think unhoused people will simply find another place to live?
The National Park Service was in charge of clearing the McPherson Square encampment because the park is on federal land, but it remains D.C.’s responsibility to deal with the consequences of uprooting so many people. The city continues to ignore and misunderstand the underlying causes of homelessness, prioritizing encampment clearings over adequate social services.
Mayor Muriel Bowser has doubled down on encampment evictions even as city lawmakers cautioned against doing so after a bulldozer swept up a tent with a person still inside during the NoMa encampment clearings in 2021. Imagine this scene and try to argue that evictions are beneficial to D.C. residents. Bowser’s desire to eliminate homelessness by any means necessary isn’t compatible with the complex situation facing each unhoused person in the District. If anything, it’s jeopardizing the city’s efforts – NoMa encampment residents told Axios last year that they weren’t comfortable accepting housing from the city.
Homelessness in the city is at its lowest point in 17 years based on a D.C. survey, but the cyclical nature of homelessness can complicate attempts to accurately count unhoused people. More than 3,403 people – including 1,007 adults and children in 347 family households – are experiencing homelessness in the city on any given night. And roughly 86.4 percent of unhoused people in D.C. in 2020 were Black – a statistic that reflects how broader racial and socioeconomic inequities have continued to plague the District.
The city operates 10 low-barrier shelters that provide beds on a first-come, first-served basis and additional overflow shelter sites to account for increased demand during the winter. But D.C.’s shelters have already been under immense stress because of the pandemic – stress that cold spells and the still-unaddressed needs of migrants to the city have only exacerbated. Even with the District’s shelters consistently near capacity, the District has closed programs connecting unhoused residents to hotels and continued destroying unhoused encampments – actions that will only exacerbate homelessness in the city.
While there are federal and local agencies tasked with addressing homelessness in D.C., something is not working. Nongovernmental organizations like the D.C. Coalition for the Homeless, Friendship Place and Thrive D.C. support unhoused people to the best of their ability, but elected officials must ensure their local communities – both housed and unhoused – have the resources they need.
The city’s $19.5 billion fiscal year 2023 budget, an uptick from $17.5 billion in fiscal year 2022, increased investments in public safety, housing programs and city services to address homelessness. Yet thousands remain unhoused every night in the District, and no amount of funding will make up for leaders who shrug off the issues they face.
Bowser called encampments “dangerous,” citing alleged violence and drug activity in McPherson Square. Only six of the more than 50 people living in McPherson Square were directly matched to housing as of Wednesday, according to the D.C. Mayor’s Office.
The desire for public safety is reasonable but demonizing unhoused people and encampments in the process is not. The city removed what some described as a perceived threat in McPherson Square with little regard for the people living there. Claims of drug activity within encampments do not justify shutting them down – they only showcase the need for more support and resources.
Unhoused people are not the enemy that the media or others might make them out to be. Homelessness is not a disease to be cured – it is a product of systemic failures, not personal flaws.
The city and nongovernmental organizations need to work together to address the basic needs of D.C. residents, or at the very least, not make the lives of those already struggling more difficult. One unhoused individual is one too many, but federal and city agencies are removing people from the places they call home just a few blocks away from Foggy Bottom. D.C.’s continued misguided efforts to address homelessness are solidifying barriers to equity, growth and success for unhoused people in the District day by day.
Empathize, speak up and determine what you can do to support your unhoused neighbors. Whether through volunteering at local organizations like Miriam’s Kitchen or Coalition for the Homeless, raising awareness or financially supporting organizations, we can all work to support those who surround us.
At a time when the fundamental right to shelter is increasingly difficult to come by, every person in D.C. – and in this world – deserves respect, dignity and empathy.

The study analyzed the effects of permafrost thaw in areas of Alaska, northwest Canadian territories, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Russia.
A Columbian College of Arts and Sciences professor found that Arctic regions will have to pay more than $276 billion by “midcentury” to counter the effects of permafrost thawing due to climate change.
Dmitry Streletskiy, the study’s lead author and an associate professor of geography and international affairs, said rising global temperatures are thawing the world’s permafrost, a permanently frozen layer of soil found in polar regions like Alaska, Russia and regions of Canada where temperatures rarely exceed zero degrees Celsius. He said funds will be needed to repair sunken roads, railroads, airport runways and buildings that incur damages from floods and sunken foundations that thawed permafrost can cause.
He said the permafrost has remained frozen but not solid amid rising temperatures, destabilizing buildings and infrastructure built on the top layer of soil and raising construction costs for the Arctic regions. He said the world’s reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement, can reduce the permafrost-related cost by about $100 billion. 
“I hope this will be a first-quarter estimate that will help legislation, those who make budget decisions across the Arctic countries to understand better that permafrost is really important for consideration when moving forward with existing developments and infrastructure,” Streletskiy said.
Streletskiy said researchers pulled temperature data from climate models to estimate permafrost temperature in the active layer – the soil layer that thaws in the summer and freezes in the winter – and locate Arctic regions where permafrost thaw would result in infrastructure damage.
The study analyzed the effects of permafrost thaw in areas of Alaska, northwest Canadian territories, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Russia.
Streletskiy said researchers inferred that Arctic communities would need infrastructure rebuilt because of damage from flooding and sinking roads or buildings as permafrost thawed, so they recorded average repair costs for roads, railroads and buildings. Streletskiy said researchers studied various countries and projects to assign the correct cost to each type of infrastructure.
He said he hopes the study will increase awareness about the impacts of permafrost thaw for Arctic governments, developers and investors from other parts of the world to determine the risks of operating on permafrost.
Streletskiy said awareness, education and training can push governments to react to permafrost degradation more quickly and limit costs from extensive damages because permafrost is already “suffering” from climate change due to continued thaw.
He said increased monitoring of permafrost temperatures in natural and industrial locations can determine where thaw is the greatest and reduce infrastructure damage and costs but current monitoring is “very limited.”
“We unfortunately don’t have enough data, but it’s never too late to have this data for future generations,” Streletskiy said. “If we start monitoring now, we can start to create a baseline for those who will deal with it in 20 or 30 years.”
Experts in permafrost and the Arctic said engineering solutions like putting buildings on pilings, posts that support the foundation of a structure, can mitigate the effects of permafrost thaw on infrastructure, but those solutions can be expensive for local officials and developers to implement.
Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor emeritus of the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said permafrost can be up to 90 percent ice, and when it thaws and turns to water, it runs off the landscape and erodes the surface. He said the eroding results in “substantial” damage to roads and “deforms” pipelines carrying gas and oil that sit on top of permafrost.
Romanovsky said rising air temperature and surface disturbances, like wildfires, agricultural activities and construction, can thaw permafrost, which releases carbon and methane into the atmosphere and increases the greenhouse effect, harming hydrology, vegetation and wildlife.
He said solutions to protect infrastructure, like elevated buildings, are expensive but mitigate the effects of permafrost thaw. Romanovsky said the study will likely draw attention to permafrost thaw within federal governments and help those living in areas with permafrost, like Alaska.
“The major impact will be upon people who are really less involved in producing the causes of this impact,” Romanovsky said. “People who live in the Arctic have much less industry there, much less internal producing of greenhouse gases and burning fossil fuels.”
William Quinton, a professor of geography and environmental studies at Wilfrid Laurier University, said it’s difficult to quantify the widespread effects of thawing permafrost in Arctic regions because it results in indirect costs like flooding damage after the permafrost thaws.
Quinton said studies that determine the economic impacts of environmental issues enable researchers to convince their funders that their study is an “important area of research.”
“The cost for people who rely on the land, whether it’s for resources or their own livelihoods, is very, very high,” Quinton said. “So the cost of doing nothing is also very, very high.”

Some residents said they still have to wait 15 to 30 minutes for the water to heat up, despite officials having replaced numerous parts in the building’s water system to solve the issue.
Facilities malfunctions have caused hot water outages in South Hall and District House for about three months with reports of cold water in the residence halls extending into last week.
More than 30 District House residents and more than 20 South Hall residents said they experienced “lukewarm” to “frigid” water temperatures from their showers and sinks as of last week, forcing them to either skip, shorten or relocate their routine showers during the outages. Some residents said the issue has persisted since fall semester, during a time when officials sent at least 10 emails with updates about efforts to fix broken parts in the residence’s irrigation system to temporary or failed avails.
In eight emails from Jan. 31 to Feb. 21, KC Costanzo, a GW Facilities customer engagement and service enhancement associate, updated South residents about a myriad of broken water system equipment in building-wide emails. The defective equipment ranged from faulty “booster pumps,” “shower cartridges,” “bleeding air,” “circulating pumps,” “boiler pumps” and a clogged “strainer.” In his most recent update Tuesday, Costanzo said Friday that staff replaced a broken “mixing valve,” a device that mixes cold and hot water to make tempered water, after shutting off the water for two hours Feb. 17.
“All three water heaters are online and functioning properly,” Costanzo said in a Feb. 6 email after announcing issues with South Hall’s booster pumps and shower cartridges. “We believe we’ve now pinpointed an issue with air present in the domestic hot water system.”
But the following day, Costanzo said the bleeding air issue was not the entire cause of the outage, and updates about different faulty parts in South Hall continued for the next two weeks.
Community coordinators and GW Facilities staff sent six emails to District House residents between Nov. 28 and Feb. 20 alerting them of hot water outages in the building, but, since December, water outages have only affected residents on floors five through 12. Officials attributed the outages to issues with the building’s mixing valves.
About two weeks after GW Facilities staff shut off District’s water for five hours Dec. 2, coordinators said they replaced “machine parts” Dec. 15, which they said would “partially resolve” the issue when fixed. The coordinators encouraged District residents in an email to shower at Lerner Health and Wellness Center as an alternative.
The outages also caused Halal Shack, located in the basement of District House, to close for business Feb. 6, with staff placing a paper sign on the vendor’s fence alerting students of the outage.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said GW Facilities staff have repaired all “identified” mechanical problems in District House in a Friday email. She said the recent hot water issues in residence halls have each had different causes and are not connected, but staff will start conducting “frequent operational checks” of all domestic hot water systems and keep stock of parts they identified as “common failure points.”
Metjian said staff continues to track water temperature and monitor FixIt requests for any “sudden spikes” in hot water issues. She said Campus Living and Residential Education “typically” offers the showers in Lerner as an alternative when residence halls are unable to offer hot water.
“Facilities has seen a significant downturn in the number of FixIt tickets in all residence halls that have had hot water issues,” Metjian said in an email Friday.
More than 20 South Hall residents said they experienced occasional hot water outages since the beginning of the spring semester. Some residents said they still have to wait 15 to 30 minutes for the water to heat up, even though officials have replaced numerous parts in the building’s water system to solve the issue.
Crystal Magandazi, a senior and third-floor resident in South, said her shower lacked hot water from the start of the semester until last week. She said when the water heats up after 15 minutes, the heat is “in and out.”
She said GW Facilities staff has marked all three of her FixIt requests resolved – the first of which she filed at the end of January – but a staff member has never come to her room. She called GW Facilities staff about the outages, and they told her they could not solve the problem, Magandazi said.
“It was horrendous, absolutely ridiculous,” Magandazi said. “Imagine waking up and having to go to work at 9 a.m. and the water is freezing cold, like ice cold, and it’s not warming up.”
Sidney Grimsley, a senior and third-floor South resident, said last week she still doesn’t have consistent hot water, with her shower heating up for only minutes at a time. She said she has to run the water for 30 minutes for the water to turn “lukewarm.”
“I couldn’t kick this cold that I had for like a long time because I was taking cold showers every night sometimes,” Grimsley said.
Ryan Cedeno, a senior, ninth-floor South resident and a member of the men’s soccer team, said he could not shower in his own bathroom because the water was “ice cold.” He said he traveled to the Mount Vernon Campus where he could use athletics facilities to shower.
“That’s like the only place I was able to get hot water,” Cedeno said.
A total of 52 District House residents said water temperature has changed frequently at some point during the school year on all building floors. About 34 of those residents, all of whom live on the top seven floors of the building, said they experienced a hot water outage last week, primarily over the weekend.
Justinian Rahmat, a freshman who lives on the 12th floor of District, said he resorted to showering at his mother’s house about an hour away after taking cold showers in District for three days starting Feb. 17.
“I’m not going to do this cold water, and I don’t want to go to my mom’s house like an hour away,” Rahmat said. “So I just be chillin’ or I take the cold shower and usually, I chill.”
Jess Malobisky, a senior and fifth-floor District resident, said in the first half of the fall semester, the water would get “really hot” without setting it to the highest temperature, but halfway through the semester, the water then became “ice cold.”
Malobisky said the water was fixed over winter break but stopped heating up and became “lukewarm” during the first few weeks of February.
“Everybody, including people in my room, kept submitting FixIts,” Malobisky said. “But nothing was really done. We kept getting emails saying that they were addressing it, but nothing was changing.”
Madison McMullen, a sophomore on the gymnastics team who lives on the seventh floor, said she has come to expect hot water outages in the building given their frequency in the past.
“I just pray that it’s hot,” McMullen said.

From an app that matches you based on astrological compatibility to one that let's your friends do all the hard work for you, these apps take an out of the box approach to dating.
The world of dating apps is wider than you think, and maybe your soulmate – or one night stand – is hiding just beyond the reach of your Tinder, Hinge or Grinder.
Maybe your ideal matches aren’t liking you back, the conversations aren’t progressing or you’re straight out of swipes. Whatever the case is, it may be time to branch out to the more niche side of dating apps. From an app that matches you based on astrological compatibility to one that lets your friends do all the hard work for you, these apps take an out-of-the-box approach to dating.
Here are five dating apps you should check out to find new, potential love interests:
For the veggie connoisseur:
Looking for someone who you can make out with and not worry about what animal product they may have recently consumed? This app is for you. Veggly is designed specifically for vegetarians and vegans looking to find a partner who shares values like protecting the earth and animals. The app has more than 1 million users and proudly boasts the 3 million “Vegmatches” made on the service. If you’ve been eager to bond over your love of Beyond Meat, or find someone who will hold you accountable to your new diet, get chatting on Veggly. Meet your match on Veggly for a passionate hookup without the lingering taste of fried chicken.
For the pet lover:
If you need your future partner to understand that they will always come second to your pet, then check out these two apps. Dig is a dating app designed to help dog lovers – and their dogs – meet. Dig users can bond over their shared love of mutts and escape the awkwardness of having a hookup who happens to be allergic to dogs, or worse, a dog hater. Tabby is a similar app but for cat lovers. The app unites feline fans, serving as a way to meet a hookup, or maybe a future cat co-parent. Let’s be real here – identifying as a cat or dog person says a lot about a person’s personality. Establishing someone’s fondness for one or the other as a prerequisite for joining the app helps weed out some of the matches you probably wouldn’t get along with anyway.
For the astrological expert:
It’s possible that your most recent failed relationship didn’t work out simply because your star signs are not compatible. To prevent that from happening in the future, check out NUiT, an app that factors astrology into the equation of finding your potential partner. The app analyzes your sun, moon and rising star signs in order to properly pair you with a match. Matching based on astrology can help you find someone who fits your needs, moods and personal style. This way, you can avoid that one sign it just never seems to work out with, and skip to a match from the stars.
For someone with great friends:
Maybe your problem with dating isn’t the other person, it’s you. Wingman is a dating app that removes you from the equation and lets your friends matchmake for you. From start to finish your friends make your profile on your behalf, swiping on and chatting with potential love interests for you. It’s possible that your problem with love is that you pick the wrong people, so give your friends a shot at choosing for you. Once you match with someone, your friends will already be sold on your partner, so you can skip the fake conversations in your group chat when everyone has to pretend your new date is cute when they tragically just aren’t. Take the backseat in your own love life, and give your friends a chance to wow you with their matchmaking skills.
For the adventurous type:
If dating has gotten boring, maybe it’s time to spice things up and rethink your monogamy. Feelds has one goal in mind: threesomes. No need to be single to join this app – couples looking to explore can create a couples account which interacts with the singles accounts on the app. You and your partner can spend time bonding over who your ideal third is, while curious singles also get to travel outside of their comfort zone. Embrace your wild side and give this app a chance to open up your world and your bedroom door. After all, monogamy can get boring, and college is the time explore multiple partners at once.

Taking notes from experimental country divorce records like Kacey Musgraves’ “star-crossed” and The Chicks’ “Gaslighter,” Ballerini is sharing her side of the story. She’s finally finding her sound, and she won’t be quiet any longer.
Grammy-nominated country singer-songwriter Kelsea Ballerini surprised fans with an ironic Valentine’s Day release of her new EP “Rolling Up the Welcome Mat” detailing her divorce from fellow country singer Morgan Evans.
On the six-track EP, Ballerini – in true country fashion – writes with intimate honesty accompanied by a 20-minute long, “All Too Well”-esque short film she wrote and directed to depict the demise of her marriage. Ballerini takes control of her narrative for the first time since she announced her divorce and received incessant criticism, backlash and rumors from Evans’ fans and the country music industry as a whole last year.
On the opening track “Mountain With A View,” Ballerini responds to Evans’ “Over for You,” a song which he released just weeks after their split while the two were still in the midst of divorce proceedings. Evans writes, “I would have searched the whole world over for you / Took a flight through the night to be that shoulder for you” and asks, “How long has it been over for you?” Ballerini replies, “Scream I’m just like my parents and giving up easy / But you never took that last flight to see me” and “I realize you loved me much more at 23 / I think that this is when it’s over for me.” The direct parallels between their songwriting captivated fans’ attention and shed light on their five-year public relationship that began when Ballerini was rising to fame at 22 and Evans was 31.
In “Just Married,” Ballerini plays off of the dual meaning of the word “just.” She sings, “But I wasn’t made for fixing a plate or keeping our problems buried / I wasn’t strong enough to hold on with all of the weight that I carried / Yeah, it was love, then it was just married.” With vivid details, including the pair’s real-life wedding date of Dec. 2 and the Veuve Clicquot champagne served at the reception, listeners can visualize the “beautiful wedding” that would eventually culminate in a messy divorce.
On “Penthouse,” perhaps her most personal ballad yet, Ballerini gets candid about how assets were divided in their divorce with a line derived from the project’s title – “It stings rolling up the welcome mat / knowing you got half.” Ballerini appeared on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast last week and told host Alex Cooper that, despite their prenuptial agreement, her ex-husband was entitled to half of the house that she paid for. She describes how their initially-idyllic move to a penthouse on 8th Avenue in Nashville quickly took a turn, “I guess wrong can look alright / When you’re playing home in a penthouse, baby.”
Although it’s a mere 45 seconds, “Interlude” may be the most brutally revealing track, not only on this project, but in Ballerini’s entire career. The experimental, genre-bending track deviates sonically from the rest of the project yet stays true to the core of who Ballerini is as an artist. Her honest songwriting describes the sexist treatment she faced throughout their divorce within the country music industry – “The rumors going ’round, but the truth is kinda nuanced / I wanna set it straight, but my lawyer says I shouldn’t / And ain’t it like this town to only criticize a woman?”
“Blindsided” continues the theme of “Mountain With A View” by responding directly to Evans, who claims he was taken aback by their divorce. Ballerini questions this, explaining that the couple had marital troubles throughout the course of their relationship. She asks Evans, “Were you blindsided or were you just blind?” The bridge delves into a “big fight” before the 2019 Country Music Association Awards. Ballerini slept on the couch the night before but had to keep up the appearance of her marriage on the red carpet the next day. That night, she gave an emotional performance of her single “homecoming queen?” – a song Ballerini called “a metaphor for somebody that seemingly has it all together and polished from the outside looking in.” The stripped-down performance struck a chord with audience members and, with this new perspective, fans can see why.
The project comes to a close on an uplifting note with a more traditional country sound in “Leave Me Again.” The ballad examines a more positive side of Ballerini’s view of Evans. She wishes him well and hopes he will find everything he wants out of life while acknowledging that “Staying only made me get real good at pretend / So I hope I never leave me again.”
It’s clear that Ballerini has entered her prime as an artist. She said on Instagram that “Rolling Up the Welcome Mat” has already outperformed the first week of her previous record “SUBJECT TO CHANGE” by millions of streams with seven fewer songs than the full-length album. Taking notes from experimental country divorce records like Kacey Musgraves’ “star-crossed” and The Chicks’ “Gaslighter,” Ballerini is sharing her side of the story. She’s finally finding her sound, and she won’t be quiet any longer.

It was devastating to find out that being who I am meant I couldn’t experience studying abroad to the fullest extent.
“Ted Lasso”’s faith in human nature drew fans into the show, and its lighthearted nature and British flair will be missed.
