Inauguration is a rite of passage of sorts at GW. With four years of college and four years of the presidency serving as an easy heuristic, virtually every undergraduate can experience the rush of inauguration at some point.
Tourists pour into the city from all over the world to see the president sworn in. Security tightens on campus. Administrators and students plan for GW’s Inaugural Ball, organizing entertainment and plans for the night that many consider GW’s version of prom.
That said, this inauguration feels different. The fervor of the 2008 election has faded into a more humbled excitement.
When students ran down to the White House the night Osama Bin Laden was killed over a year ago, there was a genuine air of excitement. It was an honest and organic response, an overflow of emotion over the death of a national enemy.
Running to the White House in 2012 to celebrate President Barack Obama’s re-election was part of the GW tradition of being the first to storm 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. But the 2008’s energy didn’t carry over.
As we make the final touches on our ball outfits and find spots to watch Monday’s swearing-in from Jumbotrons on the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, this inauguration will carry a different tune than in 2009, when the nation rang in its first black president.
GW prides itself on having a front-row seat to inaugurations and other major political moments. Political activism is part of GW’s culture. Students volunteer for campaigns and intern on Capitol Hill.
Even the University’s most recent marketing campaign is rooted in political language: “Here, a stroke of genius can a become a stroke of the president’s pen.”
But this is not the culminating experience of being a Colonial.
The tradition of inauguration as GW’s hallmark moment will undoubtedly live on, and this is a thrilling time to live in the District.
But with four years in D.C., the inauguration shouldn’t be your only defining milestone.

If you go to GW, you’ve either spent the last two weeks hearing every girl on campus complain about finding a dress, or you are one of those girls who desperately needs one.
Like most other girls at GW, dress hunting became an ordeal that was more tedious than necessary – just like before senior prom.
I began online shopping and soon found myself making a masochistic visit to verawang.com. As I began to fantasize about the evening gowns, I moved on to the wedding dress section and started to imagine color schemes for my big day.
Then I realized I only had enough GWorld money to last two months.
So, I visited the Urban Outfitters sale section, spent about an hour scouring the racks for a dress. I left with a pair of $4.99 earrings.
But the ball was drawing nearer. I needed to pull it together quickly, even the most basic task – choosing a dress color – was a struggle. Green? No, I’d look like the Christmas tree my parents threw out a few weeks ago. I decided to go with black, which would either be slimming or cause fellow ball-goers to wonder who invited the Grim Reaper. But hey, I figured I had a 50/50 shot of looking hot.
Like everyone, my dress search began with the luminescent optimism of a freshman just walking out of Union Station. I picked out the first dress that caught my eye. It wasn’t strapless. Girls from high school would wear strapless gowns and “accidentally” (read: purposely) show off the goods.
It seemed perfect. It was the right color and the right length, but best of all, my gay date approved.
I took it into the dressing room, stepped inside and began the laborious process of zipping it up. It started off easily enough, but became increasingly difficult, eventually reaching the point where the zipper, in all of its devilry, refused to move past my mid-back.
The dress was too small. I shed a tear. The dress gently hit the dressing room floor.
Sure, it was just just one dress. There would be thousands more on the racks, but I only had a few more hours left to shop and was on a strict, dirt-poor college-student budget. Besides, paying for a dress might mean missing a few meals.
The sky looked bleak and the future dreary. I expected to be the ugliest girl at the GW Ball – a giant hulking mass of a person in poorly sewn chiffon. But then I had a wonderful realization: My high school prom dress still fit.
Hallelujah.

GW could join the ranks of those elite universities that teach free, large-scale online lectures soon.
These massive open online courses, referred to as MOOCs, are taught by college professors and allow anyone with an internet connection to access courses on a range of subjects, from quantum physics to knitting socks. Simply by tuning into one of the pre-recorded lectures on a site that facilitates these classes, such as Coursera or Udacity, a curious person of any age can become a scholar.
And after creating a position for an online learning official to spearhead new programs, GW could start offering free online courses  in the near future.
But GW’s not the only institution talking about innovation in online education. These days, MOOCs are hot.
Offered at some of the best universities in the country, from Harvard to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Stanford, they’ve been reported on exhaustively by the media and lauded by philanthropists for opening up education to those who can’t afford or access it.
And the attention these courses are garnering is well-deserved. By creating an effective means to share knowledge with people who can’t afford a steep tuition bill, these open online courses demonstrate how technology can be used as a public service.
Some faculty might be doubtful of how feasible it will be for GW to offer free online courses, as doing so is a financial investment that requires state-of-the-art technology, and the courses might not meet GW’s academic standards. Some have even chided that it would simply be a shrewd marketing ploy.
Knowledge is not a privilege. Information deficits can be closed, and MOOCs exemplify the identity to which so many students who attend GW subscribe. The University has projected a commitment to service in a range of ways, from Michelle Obama’s community service challenge in 2010 to the hugely successful Alternative Breaks trips.
What better way to tell the world that GW is at the cutting edge of education and service than by educating as a service?
In D.C., you can’t miss GW’s new marketing campaign. And the identity these posters, advertisements and apparel hope to convey is that at GW, we are changemakers and that D.C. is our catalyst. According to the rebranding campaign, we’re all future political hacks, have immodest ambitions and something about the stroke of a president’s pen.
This might excite some of GW’s base, but the culture I’d prefer to be a part of is one that the University already emphasizes: a service focus that prioritizes education before its high tuition.
If the University makes the decision to offer MOOCs, it will be democratizing information that people in Argentina, Iceland and Mozambique will be able to access – information they should be allowed to access. See, having the ability to attend a university doesn’t mean we are privy to some knowledge conservatory, and as we continue to learn, we better our chances of advancing later in life.
By offering these opportunities through free online courses – it’s still not attending college, but it’s something – those chances for upward mobility become possible for more people, not just those who have $60,000 to shell out for school every year.
And if MOOCs are offered, should GW play that up for a marketing edge? Absolutely.
We might not know how much the University spent on its rebranding campaign, but we do know the bill was steep. And somehow making an investment in free online courses remains uncertain.
But choosing to offer these courses means people who might have never heard of GW in cities we can’t pronounce would learn about and from the University. They’d know GW cares about giving everyone the chance at a college education. The rest of the world could see the University making strides and investing in a field that lets anyone have a slice of the GW experience.
And that message is louder and more powerful than any catchy slogan or sans serif font.

GW ended a its five-game losing streak Sunday by reversing a pattern, turning its season-long struggles on offense into an efficient and methodical attack. The Colonials (7-10, 1-2) defeated Atlantic 10 newcomer VCU 79-68, committing to attacking the heart of VCU’s 2-3 zone defense.
GW attempted only nine treys over the course of the game and they converted just one, but the Colonials shot an efficient 53 percent from the field overall. The balanced offensive attack produced five double figure scorers and forced the Rams into attempting 20 three-point shots in an effort to keep up with the Colonials’ offense.
“We got good looks against the zone and moved the ball into the middle of the floor,” head coach Jonathan Tsipis said. “We did not settle with our shots, which was important in keeping up on offense.”
VCU could not key in on any particular GW player, because many were scoring proficiently.  Sophomore guard Chakecia Miller led GW with 20 points, converting six of seven shots and making  all eight of her free throw attempts. It was Miller’s second straight game of scoring 20 or more points. Graduate student Tara Booker supplemented Miller’s scoring efforts with 19 points, and graduate student Sara Mostafa posted a double-double, chipping in thirteen points and ten rebounds.
GW showed off the complete potential of its offense as the first half came to a close. The Colonials, down by four, were determined to avoid a sixth straight defeat. They closed the half on a 10-0 run to take a 42-36 lead into the break.
“We got good looks early, and in the second half we kept up the effort and we did a good job,” Tsipis said. “We built confidence on offense, and we kept attacking. With that mindset, the attack mentality that I’ve been proud of, we will continue to improve our offense.”
The team backed up its shooting with a strong showing at the charity stripe, going 20-for-21 from the free throw line. Further supporting GW’s attack was a dominant defensive showing that gave the team a 43-30 advantage on the boards and held the Rams to 33.8 percent shooting on the game.
The victory against VCU was the first A-10 win of the season for the Colonials and Tsipis’ first as a head coach. While Tsipis and his squad are glad to have snapped their five-game losing streak, they are more encouraged by the overall quality of play that led to the win on Sunday.
“Even better than breaking a losing streak is playing really well,” Booker said. “We executed on offense, and we shared the ball well. Right now we are looking to be more consistent.”
Consistency will be key as the Colonials prepare for conference play. Tsipis is encouraged by his team’s victory against VCU – especially that the win came on the road. Four of the five games during GW’s five game losing streak were on the road and every victory away from the Smith Center will require maximum effort and focus.
GW will play another conference road game Thursday when they take on Dayton. Tsipis acknowledges that the Flyers are a tough opponent and will be a real test for his team, but he trusts his players.
“The losing was tough. But they have not stopped working hard in practice. To go on the road and to be able to come on the road and sustain a high level of play makes me proud,” Tsipis said. “They have done a good job of being accountable for their play and getting extra work in. They have taken a lot of responsibility upon themselves to improve and get better.”

Two years after GW offered affinity housing as a way for students to live together based on a common interest, the housing office is looking to make the popular program more exclusive.
Only registered student organizations or athletic groups can apply for the program this spring, GW Housing Programs director Seth Weinshel said. The University also raised the group threshold from 10 to 12 members beginning with the upcoming round of housing applications.
“We’re not looking for 12 folks that want to live together unless they go through the process of becoming a regular student organization,” Weinshel said, marking a break from past years, when students with a common interest could secure living space together.
GW introduced affinity housing in 2011, after it nixed Living and Learning Cohorts, which gave students a budget and a faculty adviser to plan programming around a common theme.
In its second year, about 1,000 students applied and received affinity housing slots. The 100 groups, ranging in themes from cooking to watching sports, were placed in a dozen residence halls around campus. Unlike LLCs, which required an intensive application and presentation to earn a spot in the program, student organizations do not have to submit a detailed proposal of their plans for the year.
Weinshel said he hopes to discourage students from applying just to live in a specific residence hall, such as the highly popular building The Dakota. Affinity housing applications are given priority assignments, because they apply weeks before the regular deadline.
Next fall, underclassman affinity groups will live in The Dakota, Fulbright, Mitchell and Guthridge as upperclassmen move into Philip Amsterdam Hall, City Hall and 1959 E Street.
Successful affinity applicants are notified of their housing assignments Feb. 1, just a week after the general housing application deadline.
Student affinity groups will also receive faculty advisers this year as part of an expanded role for buildings’ live-in faculty.
“I think we’ll motivate each other to be more involved, think on new levels and try new things,” said freshman Kalli McKoy, who is applying for affinity housing with members of the International Affairs Society. “I am hoping that it will bring us all closer together and help us form a solid core for the IAS.”
Following the model of Strong Hall and International House, the housing office is also offering up F Street residence hall Building JJ to the growing Greek life community.
Tim Miller, director of the Center for Student Engagement, said GW wants to support  Greek life, which has demonstrated high retention rates among members.
Miller also hopes that adding more Greek housing space will open up room elsewhere for non-Greek affinity groups.
“I would never want to look at affinity and realize it’s just a new form of Greek housing,” Miller, who is also associate dean of students, said.
Panhellenic Association president Rachael Abram said the additional space in Building JJ comes at a key time, with Kappa Delta becoming GW’s eleventh sorority last fall. But she doesn’t anticipate a decrease in the Greek demand for affinity housing.
“I think that the rate that our community is growing at is going to match up with receiving more housing,” Abram said.

Behind Post Hall is a pile of rusty, reddish brown scrap metal. But the flat, angular metal pieces of abstract art represent the mountains and majestic landscape of its namesake, a rural Vermont town called Pownal.
The piece, created by an artist named Isaac Witkin in 1975, was donated to the University anonymously in 2008.
The intent was to expose the sculpture to a larger audience via foot traffic on the campus, as opposed to keeping it inside a gallery, said Olivia Kohler, assistant director of the University Art Galleries.
Kohler pointed out that steel is not typically a medium artists use to represent nature. She called the piece graceful and raw.
“With the different sides of the sculpture, you have a mountain landscape that kind of goes on,” she said. “You have a different view of the mountain as you are going around the piece.”
Witkin became good friends with Jules Olitski, an artist who has been featured in the Luther W. Brady Art Gallery, while working in Vermont, Kohler said. Olitski passed away in 2007, but his work has been an important staple to the gallery. The link between Olitski and Witkin added to the motivation behind featuring “Pownal” on the Mount Vernon Campus.
Former President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg was a strong advocate of placing more artwork on campus.
“Pownal” is the second sculpture to be installed on the Vern, part of an ongoing process of introducing new works on campus. Last year, a large metal squirrel titled “Professor Who” was placed outside Cole Hall.

D.C.’s lone representative is mounting another campaign for statehood, one that has vast support from constituents but is likely doomed to die in Congress.
Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., who submits a statehood bill every other year, has yet to see one of her attempts gain much traction. To become a law, her proposal would need to sway or overcome Republicans, who argue that the nation’s founders intended the District to be isolated from the states and hope to avoid the likely addition of a Democratic representative and two senators if the District gained statehood.
“The residents of our nation’s capital are and always have been citizens of the United States,” Norton said in a statement to the House. “Yet they are the only taxpaying Americans who are not treated as full and equal citizens.”
Norton, who does not have a vote outside of committees, put forward the bill with support from 15 other Democrats, including fellow non-voting delegates from Guam, the Virgin Islands and the American Samoa and representatives from nine states.
Her latest attempt comes after a citywide coalition, including Mayor Vincent Gray, Norton and members of the D.C. Council, galvanized residents last November through its nationwide campaign for statehood.
Gray and Norton have fused their limited political clout to advocate for D.C. budget autonomy and voting rights in Congress.
“The mayor welcomes Congresswoman Norton’s proposal for a bill,” Doxie McCoy, a spokeswoman from Gray’s office, said. “We are hopeful. We have to be realistic, but we remain hopeful. We know we have to continue the battle.”
This spring, District voters will have the chance to weigh in on whether D.C. mayors can spend tax dollars without congressional approval. The D.C. Council has authorized a referendum for an April 23 special election.
Norton first introduced the New Columbia Admission Act when she took office in 1991, but the measure failed after almost every Republican and more than 100 Democrats in the House voted against it two years later.
The U.S. Capitol grounds, national monuments and the National Mall would remain under federal jurisdiction, according to a release from Norton’s office. Two senators and one House member would represent New Columbia’s more than 600,000 residents.
The latest victory in the battle for statehood came from D.C. Council member and GW Law School professor Mary Cheh, who persuaded President Barack Obama to display the phrase “Taxation Without Representation” on the presidential limousine license plates starting at the inaugural parade.

When a GW School of Business professor prompted students to discuss their favorite food trucks on a test, she found an overwhelming favorite: Seven out of 10 students picked CapMac.
Marketing students can now merge their love for the truck’s inventive mac and cheese creations with their passion for entrepreneurship through CapMac’s new social media internship.
The popular on-wheels purveyor of pasta that holds “GWU Thursdays” on H Street linked up with business school professor Mary Schoonmaker this semester.
Schoonmaker invited CapMac’s founder and owner, Brian Arnoff, and director of operations and social media, Victoria Harris, into the classroom as guest speakers on marketing. CapMac uses social media to market itself and connect with customers as its van – complete with a mac-and-cheese paintjob – traverses the city.
“They were so inspiring as marketers. They both talked about the logo and the brand, and they’re ‘Generation Y-ers’ to begin with, [which gives them] instant credibility about marketing,” Schoonmaker said.
She said she hopes that in honing their social media expertise, business students can differentiate themselves in a competitive job market.
Harris said CapMac has developed a buzz and knows many customers by name. The truck’s business model revolves around social media.
When Harris found herself single-handedly advertising CapMac on social media platforms, the company crafted an internship program to level out the work. She asked Schoonmaker to advertise the opportunity to her marketing students.
“[The internship] gives us new blood that can provide additional ideas and generate new possibilities for the company that maybe the people that we already have working at our company wouldn’t have seen,” Arnoff said.
As the only food truck to offer internships through GW, CapMac may soon expand its intern program to include “entrepreneurial” positions, Arnoff said. The program would teach the ins and outs of running a small business, giving students first-hand experience with finance, accounting and sales.
Junior Krisha Paz got the gig as CapMac’s social media intern. Working outside the iconic truck, she takes to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to chronicle CapMac’s events and promotions as they unfold, advertising anything from upcoming neighborhood treks to special delivery deals.
Paz said she enjoys working with the young marketing staff.
“Getting into the food truck atmosphere, because I’m a D.C. native and I’ve only really been into the art culture here and never really the food culture, [is how] I get to learn about my city,” Paz said.

The School of Media and Public Affairs will aim to build its brand and pump in revenue by launching programs to help professionals catch up in the digital age.
The school’s first jump into executive education, a major money-maker typically offered by business schools, will try to tap into D.C.’s wide market of professionals working anywhere from embassies to lobbying firms and media organizations.
This program, which was unanimously approved by the SMPA faculty, is projected to help fill the media school’s coffers and focuses on “informing, organizing and persuading in the digital age,” SMPA director Frank Sesno said. He expects a surplus in revenue by the second or third year.
The GW School of Business has launched executive education programs for athletes and female corporate leaders recently, with its program for retired sports stars charging $99,500 for tuition this year.
Sesno said the school is committed to leveraging the program as a way to enhance its degree-granting political communication and journalism programs. He said revenue will be invested into more graduate student financial aid and faculty research money.
“We can’t turn into a factory. We can’t turn into an ‘adult ed’ nighttime program,” Sesno said. “That’s not what we’re trying to do, so we have to be very careful how we do this. But I also think there is huge opportunity, and there is a huge need.”
The program is similar to others offered at SMPA’s competitors like Syracuse and American universities. The program will be tailored to organizations and professionals around D.C., helping to expand SMPA’s reach and improve its stature, Sesno said.
“The opportunity is phenomenal here. Everyone in this town needs to be a communicator,” Sesno said. “They want to connect with their audience, grow their community and persuade people and be influential through the arguments they present.”
It will likely be customizable for businesses or professionals to take weekend classes or week-long sessions.
Zubin Bamji, SMPA’s director of communications and marketing, said the school has broad ideas for classes, like “building community through social media” or “interviewing skills in the digital age,” but would adapt them for different groups.
Technological upheaval in communication – from social media to web production – has created huge demand from lobbyists, nonprofit interest groups and media relations professionals to boost their skills, said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst for the nonprofit journalism school Poynter Institute.
“There’s a lot of hunger there for the new media, social media side of things,” Edmonds said. “I wouldn’t try to do that in Topeka, [Kan.], but in Washington you’ve got a terrific market of communications specialists.”
Sesno said some SMPA faculty will help design and teach the customized programs, which will include three-to-five day segments. Tuition will depend on how each program is customized, he added.
The focus on digital offerings ties in with SMPA’s degree-granting programs, which have been searching for new professors to teach multimedia and added courses in recent years like an online journalism workshop.
Sesno said he is also in talks with an Asian university to turn the program global, but said it was too early to discuss specifics.
The school is searching for a director who could be hired within the next few months to design the program.
