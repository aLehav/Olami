LaQuandra Nesbitt will serve as the executive director for the new Center for Population Health Sciences and Health Equity, the senior associate dean for population health and health equity and the bicentennial endowed professor in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, according to a University release.
LaQuandra Nesbitt, the former director of DC Health, will hold the first of the University’s 14 endowed professorships, officials said in an announcement Monday.
Nesbitt will serve as the executive director for the new Center for Population Health Sciences and Health Equity, the senior associate dean for population health and health equity and the bicentennial-endowed professor in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, according to the release. The release states that Nesbitt joined the University Monday after stepping down from her position in DC Health in July.
Nesbitt’s appointment follows officials’ allocation of more than $50 million from the University’s sale of GW Hospital in May to fund 14 endowed professorships to bolster GW’s academic medical enterprise.
“In her role leading the new center, Nesbitt will advance SMHS’ population health initiatives to improve the health and well-being of patients and communities served by the academic medical enterprise,” the release states.
The release states that Nesbitt, who is also a board-certified family physician, will oversee the planning and implementation of clinical, education and research programs at the Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Southeast D.C. The facility will be staffed by GW’s medical enterprise and is set to fully open in 2024.
“I look forward to working with many colleagues and community members I have known throughout the years in continued service to the residents of the District of Columbia and beyond to achieve better health and equity in the health care space,” Nesbitt said in the release.
Nesbitt will also expand GW’s Clinical Public Health program in collaboration with Lawrence Deyton, the senior associate dean for clinical public health.
Barbara Bass, the dean of SMHS, said in the release that Nesbitt demonstrated her “incredibly resilient and effective” leadership skills while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic as the director of DC Health.
“This response, coupled with her longstanding efficacy in leading health care delivery and public health programs in D.C., demonstrate her knowledge and skills as a nationally recognized health care leader,” Bass said in the release.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton said Nesbitt is an “exemplary individual” to earn the first of the 14 endowed professorships.
“Endowed professorships are a cornerstone of world-class research institutions, and they are very important to our ability to recruit faculty and fulfill our mission of teaching, research, patient care and service,” Wrighton said in the release.

Maria Leon-Acosta, a general body member of GW College Democrats, criticized the bussing of immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard and the District, a move seen as a political stunt by some.
Members of GW College Democrats and GW College Republicans took part in a public debate in the University Student Center Wednesday.
The participants, two per side, debated numerous issues including the economy and solutions to inflation, immigration reform and transgender athletes in sports. About 200 people attended the debate, which was moderated by GW Hatchet podcast hosts Eddie Herzig and Sejal Govindarao, marking the first time The Hatchet moderated a debate between the two organizations.
Ethan Kerr – a sophomore studying economics and political science and the political director for the D.C. College Democrats – said it should be easier to become a citizen of the United States and to vote.
“So that path to citizenship would allow, if you are actively in the military, which plenty of undocumented people are, you should be able, if you’re fighting for this country, you should become a citizen,” said Kerr. “If you’ve lived here for the majority of [your] life, you’ve fully immigrated here, you should become a citizen. This should not take 15-20 years for you to become a citizen.”
Kerr said more extensive gun legislation should be implemented to help curb the rise of gun violence throughout the country.
“In my home state of Massachusetts, we have an extreme, strict gun regulation,” Kerr said. “And yet you see no school shootings, mass school shootings have not happened in Massachusetts.”
Jackson Hoppe, a sophomore studying political science and marketing who serves as the director of public relations for College Republicans, said progressive criminal justice reform, like laws in place in San Francisco and Portland, Ore. have been ineffective.
“What we have right now, it’s a travesty because what we’re seeing is these weak-on-crime prosecutors and judges who are refusing to keep these violent criminals locked up,” Hoppe said.
Jack Elbaum, a junior studying international affairs and economics who currently serves as secretary of College Republicans, said that the biggest issue that Americans face is that of education after the pandemic.
“The biggest issue facing Americans today is education, after prolonged school closures advocated by unions and then enacted by Democrats,” Elbaum said. “According to McKinsey & Company, we’ve actually seen kids fall behind five months in math and four months in reading.”
Elbaum also said rising inflation should be curbed by a reduction in government spending, rather than legislation that attempts to drop prices.
“Rather than put big spending policies into place, whether it be the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, all which increase spending and put upward pressure on prices,” Elbaum said. “When it comes to energy, we want to incentivize and encourage oil producers to produce more so that gas prices can come down. When it comes to housing, we want to encourage people and permit the new construction of high-density housing, in order to, like I said before, increase supply and push down prices.”
Maria Leon-Acosta, a senior studying international affairs and a general body member of College Democrats, criticized Govs. Greg Abbott, R-Tex., and Ron DeSantis’, R-Fla., bussing and flying of immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. and the District, a move that many criticize as a political stunt that doesn’t address the issue of migrants at the border.
“I’m sorry, but this is something that should be condemned whether you’re on the left or whether you’re on the right,” Leon-Acosta said. “This is a human rights issue, it’s not a political issue whatsoever. “
At the end of the debate, the moderators asked the participants to say something positive about the opposition. After the other three debaters gave their remarks, Leon-Acosta noted her firm stance against the actions of the Republican Party.
“I respect individuals within the Republican Party, and I respect Republican individuals like both of you,” Leon-Acosta said. “But with that being said, I frankly do not feel comfortable saying anything positive about the party leadership, or the elected officials of a party that, by and large, bends to the will of a fascist.”

Defense was the Colonials’ weak point last season – GW’s defense ranked 12th out of 14 teams in the A-10 last year after giving up 72.8 points per game.
Whether it’s protecting the paint or closing out on perimeter shots, men’s basketball is making defense central to the team’s identity.
Newly hired Head Coach Chris Caputo said the team is looking to protect the perimeter, prevent shots in the paint and limit the number of fouls that lead to free throws as the team tries to bolster its defense. He said with the addition of two new guards – quick and agile graduate student E.J. Clark and 6-foot-5 redshirt freshman Max Edwards – the team will form a tougher defensive wall closer to the paint, with both guards providing more depth to the guard position, which he hopes will translate to higher defensive intensity.
“Trying to protect the paint a little bit better, now that sometimes comes with giving up threes, but you try to play inside out, take away the inside first and then the rim,” Caputo said. “Inside first and then the 3-point line, but you certainly know that if you’re giving up a lot of shots at the rim, you’re going to foul, you’re going to give up a high percentage of fouls. So for us, the emphasis has been on trying to protect the basketball.”
Defense was the Colonials’ weak point last season – GW’s defense ranked 12th out of 14 teams in the Atlantic 10 last year after giving up 72.8 points per game. During the A-10 Championship tournament, the Colonials struggled to stifle their opponents’ scoring runs, especially inside the paint.
The Colonials finished the season with a 12-18 A-10 record and went 1-3 in the A-10 Championship, marking an improvement from the 2020-21 season, when the team only managed a 5-12 record and a second-round conference tournament exit.
Sports Illustrated’s pre-season A-10 poll picked the Colonials to finish in 11th last season, but they ended up as the seventh seed at the A-10 tournament, placing four spots higher than any of the past five seasons.
During his time as the associate head coach at Miami, Caputo focused on a “pesky scramble defense” that looked to interrupt opponents’ offensive rhythm and force key turnovers to boost offensive chances. The Miami team used this defensive style last season to great success, reaching the Sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament.
“I think we want to play in a way that is very free flowing,” Caputo said. “We want to take advantage of our strengths, but really want to share the ball, like the idea that we are a program that is going to play selflessly, it’s very important to me. When you play that way, it attracts people to your program.”
Caputo said keeping the players in “great” physical shape and holding them responsible for their defensive assignments will be vital to keeping the team accountable.
“We’ve really spent a lot of time in the last two months on our defense since school started trying to build out a defensive identity and habits defensively,” Caputo said. “Ultimately, getting in great shape and being held accountable to your discipline defensively is so important, and so we’re going to try to take steps in the right direction there. Sometimes, to be a good defensive team, you have to have good defenders, but what we will strive to do is to make it important to the guys in the program.”
Senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. said the team has learned to talk more on the court to improve communication on defense and build trust between players, vocalizing where they each need to be to guard the ball.
“As a team, just make sure we’re all just cohesive,” Lindo said. “And listen to what Coach Caputo says because he knows what’s best for us. So we have to trust what he says so we can have the best season we can have.”

GW reached the tournament five times in the 1990s and four times between 2005 and 2014 but has slipped into a drought since then.
Men’s basketball is set to begin its first season under Head Coach Chris Caputo, hoping to improve on last year’s 12-18 record and a ninth-place finish in the Atlantic 10 Championship.
GW hired Caputo to lead the program in April after serving as the associate head coach at the University of Miami, where he helped coach the team to the NCAA tournament five times, including an Elite Eight run last season. Officials fired former Head Coach Jamion Christian in March after three straight losing seasons, prompting two of the team’s leading scorers, guards Joe Bamisile and Brayon Freeman, to transfer in April.
In the program’s 109th year, Caputo will take on the challenge of turning around a program that hasn’t seen an NCAA tournament berth since 2014. GW reached the tournament five times in the 1990s and four times between 2005 and 2014 but has slipped into a drought since then.
“It hasn’t been compounded over time to where you can look back and say, well, over 15 or 20 years, we’ve been really good,” Caputo said. “And so I think my job is to try to get us to be a successful program in the short term, but can we build out a program that is sustainable over many, many years?”
Caputo quickly got to work building his program’s infrastructure, compiling his coaching staff and hiring a recruiting and operations director within the first month of his tenure. He also filled the team’s backcourt vacancies with redshirt freshman guard Max Edwards, who transferred from Kansas State after one year, and graduate guard EJ Clark, who spent three years at Alabama State.
Both guards will help fill the gaps left by Bamisile and Freeman and play an influential role in Caputo’s five-out, perimeter-focused offense. Edwards is set to present challenges to opposing defenses with his larger, 6’5” frame and quickness.
“Max is a really talented guy that came from Kansas State, and we looked at him really as a true freshman because he was hurt a lot last year,” Caputo said. “He had never played for Kansas State, but as a true freshman he’s shown a lot of ability and diversity of skill.”
With fresh faces on the court and the sideline, a strong core of returning veterans will anchor the team as it enters the Caputo era. Senior guard James Bishop IV and senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. will lead the Colonials after logging significant minutes last season.
“I’ve tried to be a leader just with how I come to practice and my energy,” Bishop said. “The underclassmen definitely came in with a lot of energy and all the guys came in ready to learn, ready to listen and ready to be a part of what we got here.”
Lindo enters his fifth year of college and final year of eligibility after leading the squad in double-doubles and ranking second in defensive rebounds in the A-10 last season. Caputo said he hopes to keep the forward out of foul trouble this year after it limited his playing time in some games last year.
Caputo said he expects Lindo to regularly put up strong point and rebound totals, looking to him as a “double-double guy.”
Lindo said he’s taking his role as a veteran this year seriously and hopes to inspire the younger players on the team to build a culture of investment in and commitment to the team.
“I’m one of the most experienced players on his team, so just making sure I’m leading these young guys, even the guys I’ve been with for a few years, leading them, just making sure we’re all cohesive and all together,” Lindo said.
Following the season tipoff Nov. 7, the first month of the schedule will feature exclusively out-of-conference opponents, including a Nov. 30 matchup with South Carolina that will mark the first time the Colonials host a Power Five conference school at the Smith Center since 2017. A-10 Conference play will begin on New Year’s Eve against Loyola Chicago, a game that comes on the heels of the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic, a three-day invitational tournament played in Honolulu.
Caputo emphasized the warm reception he has received in his introduction as head coach, saying the community has welcomed him with open arms and he looks forward to fan support throughout the season.
“It’s so important that we have student support and I’m really looking forward to that this year,” Caputo said.
The Colonials season will officially tip off Monday night against Virginia State at the Smith Center at 7 p.m.

Students voting in states with relaxed policies on gun control and rising gun violence, like Pennsylvania and Texas, said they voted for candidates supporting tighter gun restrictions, like increasing the minimum age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21.
Students have cast their ballots in state races across the country for the 2022 midterm elections, focusing their votes on issues like reproductive health care, education and gun control.
More than 30 students said they voted via absentee ballot in November’s elections, where 435 House of Representative and 35 Senate seats, 36 governor races and thousands of local seats are at stake. More than 20 students, some from battleground states like Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida, said they voted in this year’s election to keep candidates who threaten their reproductive rights, safety and education out of office.
Two-thirds of students who voted said electing officials who support codifying reproductive rights is particularly salient during this election cycle after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federal abortion protections and triggering a rollback of abortion protections in at least 14 states in June.
Laurin Still, a freshman from Pennsylvania, said she voted this November because the outcome of Pennsylvania’s governor race could determine policies on issues like energy, voter rights and, most pressing to Still, reproductive rights.
“I think with how far-right some of our candidates are, I was really worried about where rights would end up, especially in terms of women’s reproductive rights,” Still said.
Still said Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro, who is in favor of expanding abortion access, is running against Republican Doug Mastriano, who wants to implement a bill that would ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy if elected. She said abortion rights also motivated her vote in Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate race between Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and celebrity doctor and Republican candidate Mehmet Oz. Fetterman supports codifying Roe v. Wade in Pennsylvania’s state constitution, while Oz has said states should decide the legality of abortion, except for in cases of rape, incest or when the parent’s life is at risk.
Isabella Soileau, a freshman from Louisiana, said her state is under a near-total abortion ban after a trigger law prohibiting the procedure took effect in July, excluding life-threatening situations to the fetus or parent. She said birth control accessibility has also become an issue at stake in Louisiana after Republican State Rep. Danny McCormick introduced a bill in May limiting the availability of abortion and contraception like implants and IUDs, a proposal that the state’s House of Representatives later slashed from the legislation.
Soileau said she takes birth control to treat her endometriosis, a chronic and painful reproductive disease. She said she questions the future accessibility of her medication depending on who wins local elections in her state, given the advancing “restrictive” legislation proposed earlier this year.
“The way my prescription is coming through is through my state,” Soileau said. “So as abortion becomes more attacked and as Plan B and birth control become more attacked, it affects my ability to receive health care.”
At least four students said they voted for candidates who support critical race theory to protect education in their states after governors in 17 states like Florida, New Hampshire and Idaho have passed laws to eliminate education that examines how racism is embedded in U.S. laws and institutions.
Khadijah Winder, a freshman from Florida, said she voted in hopes of unseating incumbent Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who banned critical race theory from state schools and corporations in April. According to FiveThirtyEight’s election model, DeSantis wins the Florida gubernatorial election against his Democratic opponent Charlie Crist 98 times out of 100 as of Nov. 6.
Winder said critical race theory should be taught in every public school because learning through a critical, historical lens can educate children about how they should act toward others in the present and future, avoiding previous pitfalls that illustrate a history marred by systemic racism.
“Learning our past, even the good and the bad, helps you learn from your mistakes,” Winder said of protecting critical race theory in education. “So not showing students what our mistakes were, it really hinders what they think is right or wrong, progress and how we move as a country.”
Students voting in states with relaxed policies on gun control, like Pennsylvania and Texas, said they voted for candidates supporting tighter gun restrictions like increasing the minimum age to buy a firearm from 18 to 21 with gun violence rising in their states.
Allison Barusevicius, a sophomore from Pennsylvania, said she supports Fetterman’s work to increase gun restrictions, like universal background checks for all gun purchases. Gun violence has increased by 27 percent in Pennsylvania since 2012, according to a report by the Pennsylvania State Police.
Philadelphia surpassed New York City and Los Angeles in the number of victims of gun violence so far this year, with more than 2,000 shooting victims as of Nov. 5. Pennsylvania state law doesn’t require citizens to obtain permits before purchasing firearms or conceal-carrying rifles and shotguns.
“I think gun violence in Pennsylvania, specifically in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, are huge issues right now as well, so trying to advocate for legislation in those areas is really important to me,” Barusevicius said.
Giselle Sethi, a freshman from Texas, said many people in her state were “upset” with Gov. Greg Abbott’s, R-TX, lack of a response to the murder of 21 people in the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde in May. Abbott did not fulfill victims’ families’ request to increase Texas’ age requirement to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21, calling the proposal “unconstitutional,” which sparked backlash from those families.
Abbott is running for reelection against Democratic candidate Beto O’Rourke. Sethi said she voted for O’Rourke to push for gun control in her state, but Abbott has a 12-point polling lead as of Nov. 5, according to FiveThirtyEight.
“I want to at least say that I did my part,” Sethi said. “I did my part even if the outcome isn’t what I would like it to be, and this year it’s more crucial than ever.”
Some students said they are considering candidates’ stances on immigration and foreign affairs like U.S. relations with refugees when voting in this year’s midterm elections.
Bazgha Paracha, a senior from Virginia who voted in person, said she is from an international community in the state’s 11th District, and the House of Representatives candidates’ ability to represent and provide economic aid to refugees in her district is influential to her when voting. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-VA, an incumbent who sits on the House’s Foreign Affairs Committee and supports U.S. aid for refugees, is expected to win in her district, according to FiveThirtyEight election trackers.
“For me, what’s most important in my representative is that they are respectful of the various communities that they represent,” Paracha said.

Union leaders said union members will receive details on the new agreement this week.
Updated: Feb. 10, 2023 at 5:07 p.m.
Part-time faculty could receive their first contractual raise in four years and an increased base salary after GW’s adjunct faculty union members voted on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement Friday pending the approval from administrators and SEIU 500 officials.
Union members said the new collective bargaining agreement, a document that outlines pay and benefits for adjunct faculty at GW, could increase adjunct faculty salaries from a $4,467 base salary to a $5,000 base salary and could give a 10-percent raise to all regular, or benefits-eligible, part-time faculty starting in the spring of 2023. Union leaders said they negotiated with officials for about 18 months to raise the pay and benefits for adjunct faculty, which still falls thousands of dollars short of adjunct pay offered at other D.C. universities.
Union officials said the agreement also doubled the $700 professional development fund that adjunct professors originally had access to for work-related expenses like a booking hotel room for a conference, and bans full-time faculty, who are paid a full-time salary, from taking a portion of part-time professors’ pay when co-teaching with them. Union officials said union members will receive details on the agreement this week.
Kip Lornell, the head of the adjunct faculty union and an adjunct professor of music, history and culture, said the 10 percent increase for regular part-time faculty is “notable,” but the pay falls short of accounting for the services like research and mentoring that part-time faculty provide for students in addition to teaching courses.
Officials reported that on average, full-time professors at GW earn a $186,000 salary, while associate and assistant professors earned about $118,000 and $101,000, respectively, in 2021. But regular part-time faculty earn an annual $24,683 salary, according to the University’s collective bargaining agreement between 2019-21.
“For me personally, that’s been one of the big frustrations as you point out factual information, and they just ignore it, or they don’t think it’s important,” Lornell said.
Lornell said some adjunct faculty in the music department do not earn more than the minimum salary, regardless of the length of their tenure at the University.
Prior to the new CBA, officials paid adjunct faculty with top degrees at least $4,467 to teach a three- to four-credit class – about 10 percent more than the $3,915 course minimum they were paid in 2011 – but the increase lags behind the roughly 19 percent jump for full professors and 17 percent jump for assistant professors in the same period.
“It’s the University’s prerogative to pay above what, for whatever reasons they want,” Lornell said.
Lisa Page, the director of the creative writing program, said she’s had to replace “dynamite” adjunct professors who left GW for a higher-paying institution in the past two years. She said most adjunct faculty in the creative writing program are professional poets and novelists who actively pitch stories and write under a deadline while teaching courses as part-time professors.
Adjunct professors at Georgetown University receive at least $7,000 for teaching courses that are at least three or more credits, according to Georgetown’s Office of the Provost website.
“I can’t pay our adjunct faculty what they deserve,” Page said.
She said she has reached out to CCAS leadership to ask for higher pay for adjunct faculty, but adjunct professors are often “left out” of discussions on equitable pay because they do not work full time at universities.
“Adjunct faculty all over the country are in a class by themselves,” Page said. “The system needs a complete rehaul.”
Julian Waller, an adjunct professor of political science, said some adjunct professors are not relying on their salary from teaching at GW as their primary source of income. He said adjunct faculty working for the Elliott School of International Affairs and the School of Media and Public Affairs work professionally as politicians or journalists and have the “luxury” of teaching courses to give back to their field instead of as a source of income.
He added that he would like to see an increase in the base pay for adjunct faculty because the base pay of $4,467 from the prior CBA for adjuncts teaching a three- to four-credit course does not accommodate the high cost of living in D.C.
“For the average adult in D.C., that money is inconsequential,” Waller said.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that regular part-time faculty were tenure-eligible faculty. Regular part-time faculty are benefits-eligible faculty. We regret this error. This post has also been updated to clarify the average pay of associate and assistant professors in 2021. This post has also been updated to clarify the new CBA could give a 10-percent raise to all regular, or benefits-eligible, part-time faculty.

Between Democrats and Republicans who blame each other for threatening democracy to candidates running for office who deny the results of the previous presidential election, the 2022 midterms are primed to be the most contentious and most consequential in recent U.S. history. Like many of GW’s politically active students, I’m excited to have cast my first general election ballot, but I’m anxious that a hyper-partisan political scene will scrutinize my vote and demand loyalty that I’m not ready to give.
I’m an unaffiliated voter – my political values don’t strictly align with any one side of the two-party system. While I may support a public health care option, I’m not convinced it would be beneficial in an evolving public health sphere. And though I see the need for a civilian law enforcement branch, I still think reform is desperately needed to minimize and eliminate abuses of power. In a political landscape quick to label people based on the various beliefs they hold, independent voters should be respected as their own political identity.
Group affiliations built on loyalty are a natural part of human history, but hyper-partisan commitment crosses into dangerous territory. A Cambridge University study found that such tightly wound political ties can lead voters to care less about democratic values than their party’s victory when considering their next vote. I left the Republican party in my early teens when Republicans were unwilling to accept me as a “real” Republican because my views on some issues, like transgender rights and abortion, deviated from the party line. But I wasn’t flipping to the Democrats anytime soon – they asked for that same loyalty, unwilling to accept some of my views on government spending and the transition to green energy.
Neither party is a good home for voters like me whose opinions are based on a utilitarian understanding of political issues. I believe in broader ideals like freedom, security and justice applied to individual circumstances, not sweeping ideological mandates centered around the notion that a political party holds a monopoly both on the truth and moral righteousness.
Democrats and Republicans traffic narratives of heroes and villains that create a fight for the “soul of the nation” – a metaphorical battle that may rally voters but muddles the real-world implications that their policies will have on access to food, housing or adequate medical care for the sake of total party victory. Worse still, it feeds into a spiteful political discourse that is not reflective of reality and dehumanizes our political opposition.
Partisan loyalty was the standard in my small, western North Carolina hometown. In high school, my peers agreed that if I voted for anyone besides Joe Biden or Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, whom I felt at the time I could not support, my vote would be meaningless or purposefully spiteful to the candidate they preferred. On virtually every issue, they viewed one side as simply right and the other as backwards or morally misaligned. And the concept that there could be more than two perspectives on an issue was practically nonexistent.
These accusations often leave me with a lot of stress that I have to be particular in how I vote. I’m not alone in feeling this stress, either – 35 percent of Americans identify as Independents, according to an October 2022 Gallup poll. But when both the former and current president exclaim the other party is only capable of bad things, they’re signaling that Independent voters ought to come home to their side. The weight of expectations from both Republicans and Democrats or conservatives and liberals can lead many Independents to side with a party even if their more personal values don’t adhere to the party platform. But others may feel that the pressure to vote the “right” way is too much and recuse themselves of their vote entirely.
Despite generally outnumbering Republicans and Democrats every year since 2004, there’s a caveat to the Independent label. Partisan affiliation polls lump us into one of the major parties and give the impression that nobody takes our independence seriously. Even if you are an Independent who feels generally more aligned with one side or the other, that shouldn’t mean you have to give up some of your identity to answer a call for loyalty on the side you may sometimes agree with.
But the solution is not to avoid voting. In a political field rife with hyper partisanship that’s hurting all voters, Independents deserve to have their own identities. The United States political system would benefit from a more diversified electorate that doesn’t lump themselves with one side or the other, but thinks and votes on its own accord. Democrats and Republicans alike should approach Independents as people with their own identity – we’re not pawns in the binary two-party system or just simply their political opposition.
It’s okay to be a part of a tribe of ideas – it helps us understand a world that’s more complex than us. But the narrative that one side or the other is the threat to democracy alone and must be eradicated isn’t healthy. If we take the time to understand the political motivations of voters with contrasting identities instead of turning them into faceless villains, we can better hold our political system accountable for its actions, foster a more inclusive voting environment and preserve our democracy.
