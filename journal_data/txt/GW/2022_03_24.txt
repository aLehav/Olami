Ulehla was hired in June 2019 and saw her first season end abruptly due to COVID-19 after playing only seven games.
After a 2-6 nonconference schedule, lacrosse will look to make some noise in Atlantic 10 play in Head Coach Jennifer Ulehla’s first season that wasn’t interrupted because of the pandemic.
Ulehla was hired in June 2019 and saw her first season end abruptly due to COVID-19 after playing only seven games. Her second season was marred by the pandemic as well, and the team only played 12
Ulhela said she tested positive for the virus at the beginning of March, causing her to miss two games.
Although the former Michigan coach has faced obstacles in building the program, she said she is confident it’s heading in the right direction thanks to an infusion of talent and a strong group of leaders.
“This is a younger team, although we have great leadership and great seniors,” Ulehla said. “We do have a lot of youth, but it’s a lot of athletic and energetic youth. So for me, I knew we would have some great leadership with our seniors and they would really bring along our freshmen and even sophomores at this point to help elevate our game.”
Following a 6-6 finish to the 2021 season, the team lost 32.4 percent of their scoring to graduation, including their two highest goalscorers, midfielder Catie Perkins and attacker Ioanna Mantzouratos.
Ulehla responded by bringing in 13 freshmen, who have so far played a big role, combining to start 24 games, score nine goals and tally six assists. But with youth comes inexperience, and the team is still learning how to consistently play the high energy style that Ulehla is pushing for.
“We pride ourselves on being really competitive,” Ulehla said. “But the consistency and the concentration it takes to sustain that through an entire game is where, when you’re young, that can really ebb and flow.”
The team has tested themselves so far, playing a strong nonconference schedule in preparation for conference play. The average Ratings Power Index of the teams they’ve played is 67.75, with their toughest test coming in their first game of the year against a Navy team ranked 37th in the country.
“We’re playing teams, obviously, that are very strong,” Ulehla said. “They may not necessarily have the conference name behind them, but they’re very talented and they have great coaches.”
In the offseason, the team worked to grow closer and now prides itself on their connectivity. They are hoping to build on their off the field bonds to get tangible results on the field.
“The biggest thing for us is to really have a family and create a family here,” senior midfielder and captain Kendall Lambert said. “Someone to lean on, someone to guide you, someone to walk you through homework when you’re having troubles, someone to walk you through difficulties on the field, too.”
Lambert said the team picked up right where they left off even when Ulehla was out for a few games because they were able to rely on their assistant coaches Leighann Stauffer, Hayley Sabol and volunteer assistant coach Kelly Layton as well as strong leadership among the player base.
So far this season, Lambert has also taken on a heightened role on the field, starting every game in nonconference play for the Colonials and leading the team in assists with six, points with 11 and caused turnovers with 12.
Coming into the season, the team is predicted to finish seventh along with La Salle in the A-10 Preseason Coaches Poll. This comes after missing out on the four team conference tournament in a unique 2021 season in which they played four teams twice and didn’t play five teams at all.
“Depending on how injuries go, our goal is to make it to the A-10 tournament, to be one of those top four programs,” Ulehla said. “So we’ve got to be able to beat one of those four teams to get into the conference tournament.”
Unlike last year, the team will play all 10 teams in the conference. The Colonials will be tested immediately, playing two of the top four teams in the league to start their conference schedule.
“We’re a large team,” sophomore midfielder Kianah Watson said. “So having a strong culture of being able to support each other is very important going into the season. We’re gonna be playing a lot of games in a short period of time. So having each other’s back is incredibly important.”
GW opens conference play at Davidson on Friday, March 25 at 6:30 p.m. before coming home to play Richmond two days later at 1 p.m.

When Guy Fieri visited Bub and Pop's in 2020, the bolognese parmesan was his favorite of the sandwiches he tried.
You might associate downtown D.C. with sterile office buildings and pedestrians rushing around in suits, but nestled in the cityscape you’ll find Bub and Pop’s, an old-fashioned sandwich shop that oozes a nostalgic, small town vibe.
Located at 1815 M St. NW, between Dupont and Downtown, Bub and Pop’s charming red facade stands out among M Street’s copious glass-paned buildings. The awning above the steps leading to the entrance features an endearing and homey caricature logo of Bub and Pop, a married couple from South Philly whose reimagining of the Italian hoagie and brisket sandwiches serve as inspiration for the menu’s offerings.
I was initially skeptical that a sandwich restaurant in downtown D.C. would be able to capture the authentic sub shop aura I was used to in delis back home in Boston. Any qualms I had were immediately dashed as I entered the restaurant and was met with colorful walls adorned with decorations ranging from sci-fi movie posters to pictures of famous patrons, like chef Guy Fieri and comedian Aries Spears.
The dining area was on the smaller side, but no one in the packed restaurant seemed to mind as they eagerly waited for their sandwiches to be distributed from behind the counter. While the string lights and fancy mirrors made eating inside the restaurant tempting, I opted for the joint’s outdoor seating area, which was lovely for people watching during a busy weekday on M Street.
The menu, which is handwritten on a large chalkboard next to the ordering area, features specialty sandwiches like cheesesteaks ($10 to $20), brisket ($10 to $20) and the “Philly Special,” which includes roasted pork, au jus, provolone, broccoli rabe and sautéed hot chili peppers ($11 to $22).
Those looking for a lighter bite than a hefty hoagie or cheesesteak can choose from soups (market price) or salads ($5 to $10). On the sweeter side, Bub and Pop’s offers a cookie of the day ($2), which you can have made into an ice cream sandwich ($5), and water ice ($6), more commonly known as Italian ice for those not from Philly.
As a fan of Italian food, I had to opt for the bolognese parmesan ($10 to $20), which included rustic tomato and meat ragu, caramelized onion, aged provolone and Pecorino Romano, along with my bottle of coke ($3). In fact, when Fieri visited Bub and Pop’s in 2020, the bolognese parmesan was his favorite of the sandwiches he tried.
When I dug into my sandwich after a 15-minute wait, I was blown away by the different types of meat blended with a picturesque red tomato sauce that looked as though it had been made fresh that morning. Flakes of Pecorino Romano topped it off, making it look like an authentic Italian dish had been placed on a beautifully toasted bun.
As I took my first bite I knew immediately why Fieri singled the bolognese parmesan as his favorite. I could taste every flavor of the sandwich, the perfectly cooked meat blending masterfully with the melted cheese and decadent sauce.
The sandwich is definitely on the messy side, and globs of meat and sauce fell out of the bolognese parmesan fairly regularly. I typically like my sandwiches to stay in one piece, but I enjoyed the flavors so immensely that I simply looked forward to being able to eat the rest of the ragout with a fork after I finished the sandwich.
For a reprieve from the stoic, corporate atmosphere of Downtown, take a nostalgic trip to Bub and Pop’s for a classic sandwich.

Alana Haim of pop-rock band HAIM and Cooper Hoffman, son of the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, co-star in the coming-of-age comedy ‘Licorice Pizza.' 
After a year of pandemic-induced delays, movies returned to theaters in full force last year, culminating with a slate of 10 films fighting for the Best Picture trophy.
Many of these films can be found in theaters or on streaming platforms during the lead-up to the Oscars, so next time you need to take a break from studying, catch one of these acclaimed flicks. Here’s a rundown of each of the films nominated for Best Picture to help you decide which ones to squeeze in before the ceremony:
‘Belfast’
A touching coming-of-age film, Kenneth Branagh’s “Belfast” is a semi-autobiographical look at a Protestant family’s life in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s at the beginning of the Troubles. The film follows a young boy and his family as they attempt to navigate life in a rapidly changing and sometimes violent world. Central to the film is the friction in having to decide between staying with family or fleeing to safety. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this film is a compelling and emotional frontrunner with a real shot at taking home the big prize of Best Picture.
‘CODA’
Director Sian Heder’s “CODA” offers an emotional depiction of what it means to be family. The film follows Emilia Jones’ portrayal of Ruby, the titular CODA, or child of deaf adults, as she has to decide whether to pursue her passion for music or stay by her family’s side to help their fishing business stay afloat as the only hearing member of the family. At the core of the movie is the relationship between Ruby and her family and the love, however complicated, that they share for each other. “CODA” is a heartwarming film sure to leave you wanting more as the credits roll.
‘Don’t Look Up’
Directed by Adam McKay, this satirical, apocalyptic comedy-drama might hit close to home amid the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing political polarization. Two Michigan State University astronomers, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio, make the scientific discovery of a lifetime that a comet is on track to hit Earth. Chaos ensues as their attempts to warn the public about the grave threat are hindered at every turn by a corrupt government administration. They navigate between diplomatic avenues as well as trying to warn the world through the media, though no one seems to care either way, and some even spread misinformation through the “Don’t Look Up” campaign. A film that combines both elements of comedy, drama and a little bit of tough realism, “Don’t Look Up” will certainly leave audiences with plenty of food for thought.
‘Drive My Car’
A passionate and heartbreaking road-drama, “Drive My Car” tells the story of Yūsuke Kafuku, played by Hidetoshi Nishijima, a fictional famed director and actor chosen to direct a play in Hiroshima and chauffeured by a young driver, Misaki Watari, portrayed by Tôko Miura. Yūsuke accepts the residency in Hiroshima after a personal tragedy, the effects of which are masterfully woven throughout the film by director Ryusuke Hamaguchi. Despite being just under three hours in length, “Drive My Car” is expertly paced, never including a dull moment as Yūsuke and Misaki’s relationship develops.
‘Dune’
A groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Herbert’s legendary novel, “Dune” is an unforgettable epic for devoted and casual sci-fi fans alike. The desert planet Arrakis is beautifully brought to life by director Denis Villeneuve, whose grand visual style is perfect for Herbert’s world. “Dune” is more than just its cinematography, featuring an all-star cast headlined by Timothée Chalamet, who delivers a standout performance as Paul Atreides, a young noble who finds himself in the middle of a war for resources and a mysterious messianic prophecy. Villeneuve expressed hope for at least two sequels, so be sure to see “Dune” as soon as you can.
‘King Richard’
Hollywood legend Will Smith stars in “King Richard” as the father and coach of the modern-day tennis champions, Venus and Serena Williams, played by Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton, respectively. The film follows the girls’ journey on their path to becoming icons in tennis history as they are led by their brilliant and unrelenting father. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green artfully composes a heartwarming tale in his inspirational sports biopic that when coupled with breathtaking performances from the leading cast results in an explosion of emotions before your eyes. The heart of this movie lies in the nuanced storytelling and compelling performances of the entire cast portraying a family on the path to respect and success while simultaneously shattering glass ceilings.
‘Licorice Pizza’
Alana Haim of pop-rock band HAIM and Cooper Hoffman, son of the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, co-star in this 1970s coming-of-age comedy from writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson. Hoffman’s character, a teenage hustler named Gary Valentine who dabbles in waterbed sales and other hijinks, is the perfect foil to Alana Kane, portrayed by Haim. Set in California’s San Fernando Valley, the light-hearted but sincere movie comedically embraces the drama of 1970s Hollywood.
‘Nightmare Alley’
Guillermo del Toro’s “Nightmare Alley” is a grim, yet visually magical tale of a carnival worker turned psychic, played by Bradley Cooper, whose penchant for cons and murder fuel his hunger for wealth and fame. Set in the 1940s, the film transports the audience to the peculiar world of a traveling circus and later to the gilded circles of New York’s elites, where Cooper’s character, Stanton Carlisle, employs deception to orchestrate lucrative cons presented as clairvoyance. But when he collaborates with an equally crafty psychiatrist, played by Cate Blanchett, to con one of New York’s wealthiest men, Carlisle’s lust for wealth finally spells his demise. As much a tale of sparkling showmanship as it is a tale of grotesque crime, the audience is left pondering the psychology of the human mind.
‘The Power of the Dog’
This dramatic new-age western follows two radically different ranchers in 1925 Montana. Phil, a charismatic but domineering ranchhand portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, leads the Burbank ranch while George, Phil’s soft-spoken brother portrayed by Jesse Plemons, assists from behind his brother’s shadow. Their routine life undergoes a change after George marries a widowed inn owner, Rose Gordon, and Phil exercises his power and cruelty over Rose and her son Peter, leaving them traumatized and alone in their new home. The story that unfolds is thrilling and filled with torment, fear and is fraught with tension that comes to a head in a twist ending that no one could see coming. Written and directed by Jane Campion, who became the first woman to receive two nominations for Best Director, “The Power of the Dog” emerged in the eyes of the public after nabbing the most Oscar nominations of the year.
‘West Side Story’
Nearly 60 years after the first film adaptation of “West Side Story” won the Oscar for Best Picture, the vibrant musical, which was remade last year by directing maestro Steven Spielberg, is once again vying for the most coveted award of the night. Hollywood newcomer Rachel Zegler delivers a stunning performance as Maria in the second film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s iconic Broadway musical, a beautiful and dynamic film that captures the allure of New York City and young love.

As officials prepared to open an all-you-can-eat dining hall in Shenkman Hall next academic year, Potbelly had been the only existing vendor to remain in the building.
Updated: March 24, 2022 at 11:32 a.m.
Potbelly, a Shenkman Hall dining staple for more than 15 years, has permanently closed its shop on campus.
Potbelly’s closure, which was announced with a hand-written sign taped to the restaurant’s door, comes weeks after the closure of another GWorld vendor housed in Shenkman Hall – Asian restaurant Teashi, which was located in the building’s basement. Officials have previously said Potbelly would be the only vendor to remain in Shenkman next year as part of the transition to a new unlimited dining system – which will open three new dining halls this fall in residence halls, including Shenkman.
Assistant Dean of Students Seth Weinshel confirmed to The Hatchet that the GWorld vendors’ departure is connected to the transition to the University’s new dining system.
The University was planning to revitalize Potbelly with a “new retail concept” as part of the dining overhaul prior to its closure.
“Thank you for a great 16 years at the Buff and Blue,” the sign reads.
Potbelly originally moved into Shenkman Hall in June 2006 when the building was known as Ivory Tower. Potbelly opened its doors after a 17-month legal battle with the building’s previous sandwich shop – Coggins Sandwich Manufactory – which allegedly infringed on Potbelly’s trademarks.
This post was updated to include the following:

At the University of Virginia and elsewhere, “hushed voices and anxious looks dictate so many conversations,” UVA senior Emma Camp wrote in an essay published in The New York Times earlier this month. Camp said some students who are only comfortable discussing controversial topics in private experience a “pile-on” when they voice unpopular views in class and lie about their views to avoid confrontation. According to Camp’s point of view, backlash for unpopular opinions and the pressure to conform has led students to censor themselves on college campuses nationwide, which has hindered her and other students’ abilities to have meaningful debates.
Though student self-censorship is real and hardly limited to UVA, the panic surrounding it is utterly laughable in the face of far more serious censorship of students and staff, including at GW itself. University-led attempts to punish political expression and outside pro-censorship pressure campaigns pose a more serious threat to student and staff members’ speech than feeling bad about an in-class debate ever could. Whether you lean liberal or conservative at GW, you’ve no doubt elected to keep quiet during classroom discussions about controversial topics. Camp’s uncritical commitment to unpopular ideas in the classroom – even those which lack evidence and logic – does not further students’ education by exposing them to new views. Instead, promoting so-called “intellectual diversity” amounts to uncritically platforming and rewarding certain views on their face. 
More than 80 percent of students report censoring their viewpoints at their colleges at least some of the time, and 21 percent of students say they censor themselves often, according to a 2021 College Pulse survey that Camp cites in the essay.  
Collegiate self-censorship and personal censorship in all walks of life is as much about politeness as it is politics. Though it can be anxiety-inducing, thinking before we speak or not speaking at all ensures people don’t view us as inconsiderate jerks or something far worse. The ability to navigate difficult situations with different people requires a degree of social and emotional intelligence – it is a survival strategy in a rapidly changing world. 
Societal pressure stemming from the context of the conversation tips the balance of when we decide to self-censor. Democratic respondents to the 2021 GW Marriage Pact outnumber their Republicans counterparts 10 to one. While that may not be representative of the entire University, that overwhelming consensus around liberal ideas might push conservative students to self-censor.
But feeling like you can’t speak is different from not being able to speak at all. Unlike Liberty University, for example, no “culture of fear” or concrete policies stop GW students from voicing their beliefs. Instead, the University has a long history of political activism and expression.
If you’re genuinely concerned with self-censorship, then take part in that tradition. Speak up and welcome whatever comes next. But don’t expect to have it both ways. You can be popular, or you can say what you believe. By and large, your peers are a captive audience, not an eager one. They aren’t obligated to applaud controversial or unpopular opinions simply for being controversial or unpopular. 
Some students are clearly comfortable making their voices heard. I’ve witnessed fellow students explain their opposition to including transgender women in women’s sports in front of their gender non-confirming peers and watched male students describe so-called reverse sexism to a group of largely female students. 
Besides being offensive, these “debates” amount to ego-driven, mind-numbing soapbox stands that waste valuable time meant for professors’ professional expertise. Unlike skillfully delivered lectures, such discussions hardly enrich students’ education. The free speech problem rocking college campuses isn’t so much that students’ politics are taboo as their points are asinine. 
Ironically, embracing “intellectual diversity” would only make that issue worse. It’s foolish to make uninformed or ignorant ideas untouchable simply because they’re controversial. Artificially balancing views or guaranteeing equal time for each side of a debate prevents the best ideas from rising to the top and hardly furthers the intellectual rigor of college campuses. And even worse, officially protecting “intellectual diversity” for its own sake would force students to censor their responses for fear of reprisals. 
Student self-censorship is here to stay in a world where we judge people by what they say and do. It’s not fairly innocuous self-censorship, but institutional censorship, that should concern college students of all political stripes.
The University faced a genuine censorship scare in February after interim University President Mark Wrighton condemned and said he would remove posters criticizing the Chinese government. Though Wrighton later backpedaled in a statement, his hasty response and alleged promise in an email to investigate the students responsible gained national attention and criticism. 
And paradoxically, Turning Point USA, which bemoans conservative students’ self-censorship, maintains a “professor watchlist” of “radical” professors that includes two GW faculty members. Under the guise of informing prospective students and their parents, the watchlist has a chilling effect on professors’ own speech and opinions.
Students come to college for professional development, the expertise of their professors and ultimately a degree, not to listen to their peers ramble incessantly about personal political grievances. The demagoguery of cringeworthy controversial opinions and half-baked hot takes in the classroom is just as bad as any campus culture of silence. While we all have a right to speak and ought to exercise it, self-censoring makes you a mature adult – not a victim of your peers’ tyranny.

When officials announced detailed and updated dining plans beginning next academic year in an email last month, it was clear that next year’s sophomores would be participating in a plan markedly different from the one they agreed to when they first arrived at GW. As a member of the Class of 2025, who has enjoyed using the current plan for residence halls with kitchens, I would prefer to continue the same plan next year, without any need to use the dining hall, especially since I’ll have a private kitchen again.
Unlike the current dining hall plan which allocates a fixed amount of money to spend at either GWorld vendors, including Whole Foods and the Georgetown Safeway, the new plans separate the account between one dedicated to dining halls and another to GWorld vendor balance. Ultimately, the new plans offer greatly reduced GWorld balances for next year’s freshmen and sophomores, compared to the current plan. Originally, only one option was offered to next year’s freshmen and sophomores, including unlimited dining swipes, plus varying declining GWorld balances. While first and second year students were restricted to this plan, third and fourth year students could also choose the block plan or legacy base plan, which costs about 50 dollars more than the current plan for students with private kitchens.
Hundreds of current freshmen have petitioned against the single plan offered to them next year after receiving the original dining email. Officials sent an email to the Class of 2025 earlier this month informing them that they can now also opt into the block plan, which gives students varying amounts of both dining hall swipes and declining GWorld balances. Although expanding options for next year’s sophomores was a step in the right direction, GW should reconsider allowing the Class of 2025 the option to dine via the legacy base plan, as we are accustomed to it, we’ll have access to private kitchens next year, and some students have food allergies that are easier to avoid with the legacy base plan.
The Class of 2025 came to GW without knowledge of the recently announced dining plans. When we enrolled, we understood we would have access to the open dining plan and expected to dine exclusively via GWorld money. Although I was initially hesitant about the lack of dining halls because of their commonality at most colleges, I’ve grown to enjoy and appreciate the freedom that dining exclusively via the GWorld balance gives us. Dining on GWorld money has taught my friends and me more about budgeting, meal-planning and cooking, and has promoted independence.
Most sophomores next academic year will have private kitchens in their residence hall rooms, which helps to financially maximize meals for some students. But less money for groceries and more toward dining hall swipes can put students in an awkward position in trying to fully use their kitchens. Residence halls with private kitchens, which make up almost all upperclassmen halls, cost substantially more money per semester than residence halls without kitchens. Requiring the Class of 2025 to pay for both a plan involving dining hall swipes and a kitchen in their residence hall is too financially demanding for students and families. This is especially true when the two offered plans cost from $330 to $1,430 more per semester than the legacy base plan.
The plans offered to next year’s freshmen and sophomores primarily benefit freshmen, most of whom will be living in residence halls with community kitchens, rather than private kitchens. Community kitchens are difficult to regularly cook in comparison to private kitchens, which makes the new plan ideal for incoming freshmen. Students with food allergies and sensitivities have already voiced concerns with a lack of food options at Pelham Commons. The current dining plan allows students much control over what they eat, and provides options for a variety of good quality food. Allowing students who have thrived on and prefer dining solely via their GWorld balances the option to continue in doing so will best suit the needs and wants of all students.
When describing the current plan on the GW Dining website, officials write, “This is not a typical college dining plan, because GW is far from a typical college experience.” Like the website states, the uniqueness of the dining experience here is partly why I chose GW.
Implementing and maintaining three dining halls is costly for GW, but officials should consider phasing in the new dining system over several years, rather than suddenly, to give students time to become accustomed to it. Requiring dining hall usage and limiting GWorld declining balances so soon for the Class of 2025 is upsetting to students who have thrived on the current dining plan. Adjusting to a plan that is unideal to some students is especially difficult amid an already uncertain college experience, due to the pandemic. GW’s dining plan has been contested for years and both current freshmen and other classes may be excited to try plans involving dining swipes, but since some of us already prefer the current plan, GW should make the legacy base plan one of the three dining plan options available for sophomores next year.
GW Dining’s website highlights the benefits of GW’s unique GWorld dining system. The website boasts, “Our open dining plan gives students access to food and groceries from more than 90 dining partners concentrated on our campuses and in our surrounding neighborhoods.” It goes on to say, “designed to fit the busy lifestyle of GW students, the plan supports myriad dietary preferences by providing diverse dining options, healthy foods and convenience.” Forcing a reduction of GWorld money for a class who has spent a year adapting to GWorld is contradictory to this message.
GW’s limited plans for next year’s sophomores has caused dining anxiety for students who worry if they’ll be able to eat the dining hall’s food or if paying for a certain plan will be worth the money. Further, it has disconnected officials with current freshmen, who feel let down by GW in this decision. It is especially difficult for some students to imagine adapting to an unideal plan during an already uncertain college experience regarding COVID-19. To alleviate the concerns of the freshman class, GW should allow the Class of 2025 to opt in or out of the legacy base plan.

If passed, the referendum would require the senate to adopt its budget for student organization allocations for the upcoming fiscal year in March.
Updated: March 24, 2022 at 8:24 p.m.
The Student Association Senate approved a referendum for the SA’s upcoming election ballot Monday asking students whether to amend the SA Constitution in line with “current financial practices” at an emergency senate meeting.
The referendum will ask students whether the constitution should codify how students can approve or reject potential adjustments to the SA fee and require the senate to adopt the budget for the upcoming fiscal year in March. SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U, introduced the Financial Practice Act, which the senate passed almost unanimously, to add recent finance bylaw reforms passed throughout the academic year to the constitution.
If students approve the referendum, the constitution will outline a process allowing students to vote on any proposed adjustments to the SA fee – which totals $3 per credit hour – through a referendum.
Xu said adopting a new fiscal budget later in the spring is “not practical” when senators are still newly elected and also need to fill each of the senate’s five committees.
“To let the senate-elect adopt the budget for next fiscal year is not practical because they will organize them into committees in mid- to late-April,” Xu said. “And we are already at the end of the semester, everyone will go on vacation.”
For the second consecutive meeting, the senate rejected legislation that would have set two other referenda asking students to expand the powers of the SA’s judicial branch and fill senate vacancies through special elections and non-voting delegates.
The Judicial Reform Act, the first bill to fail, would have placed a referendum on the election ballot asking students to give the Student Court more influence over senate procedure through advisory opinions on subjects not brought before the court. SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, Law-G, said he voted against the resolution for a second time, after the senate first debated the legislation earlier this month, because it would overextend the power of the court.
“To my understanding, this is still allowing for advisory opinions, which I’m still against,” Ingraham said. “I think it doesn’t fit the need for the court. I will still be voting no on this resolution because of that.”
The Electoral and Representational Reform Act, the second bill to fail, would have set a referendum asking students to allow the senate to fill vacancies through special elections and appoint non-voting delegates from “underrepresented” groups, like freshmen on campus. Vacancies are currently filled by senate confirmation.
SA Sen. Gabe Young, CCAS-U, who supported the act, said the resolution needed more “tangible” definitions of “underrepresented groups.” He said the lack of a concrete definition could create problems for future senate bodies.
“I’m not fully opposed to it,” Young said. “I would just prefer if there could be another amendment right now that can provide some more concreteness to this.”
The next senate meeting will be held March 28 at 8:30 in the Continental Ballroom in the University Student Center.
This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the newly elected senate can adopt the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The current senate can adopt the budget in March. The Hatchet also reported that the legislation would amend the SA Constitution in line with recently updated finance bylaws. The amended constitution would align with  “current financial practices.” We regret this error.

About a dozen attendees filed into the event at the Elliott School of International Affairs Tuesday, where Gen. Richard Myers talked character and leadership.
The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed personal character and leadership at the Elliott School of International Affairs Tuesday.
Gen. Richard Myers discussed his experiences as one of the highest ranking officers in the U.S. military, the entry of students into public service and his opinions on university governance. About a dozen attendees filed into the event, which was hosted by The Elliott School’s Leadership, Ethics and Practice Initiative and moderated by alumnus Sebastian Reyes.
Myers said quality leaders should exhibit honor, humility and humor, and those who fail to be humble or recognize their own strengths will struggle to rise in their careers.
“It’s your personal integrity that enables you to be trusted, which enables relationships,” he said at the event. “So when you think about it, the whole honor thing – integrity – how we get through life is in relationships, whether it’s our partners in life, or other folks in our military unit, or folks in other countries’ militaries.”
Myers said President Joe Biden has succeeded in creating unity among Western countries in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He said staying united has become increasingly difficult since previous U.S. administrations have turned the country inward with less interest in international diplomacy and military intervention.
“Then there are actors that would like to destroy our world order as we know it,” he said. “And so China has worked on that very hard – sorry, but I don’t do much about that – and Russia is working on right now and this is an assault on a liberal democracy, and the standards we’ve had since World War II about how we deal with each other.”
Myers said young people who are planning on joining the military should never allow for the training regiments to compromise their values or upbringing. He said maintaining your own independence and personality will help people stand out in their careers.
“I always sort of kept my eyes on the bigger picture,” he said. “And never compromise your values – they won’t ask you to do that – they may push you, but don’t ever compromise your values, your personal values, what you hold dear, just to get ahead. Just be yourself.”
Myers added that people in leadership roles need to be prepared to stand up to their superiors when they make decisions they disagree with.
He said during the administration of former President George W. Bush, military leaders announced a policy that excluded Afghan citizens from the Geneva Convention, which set legal standards for wartime humanitarian efforts. Myers said he and a group of military officers had to respond swiftly to the decision to convince President Bush to reverse the decision because of their humanitarian objections to the move.
“Sometimes you are so busy you just need to step back, go up to 30,000 feet, look down and say, ‘Are we doing this in an ethical way that’s consistent with our values in America, my personal values,’” he said.
Myers, the former president of Kansas State University, said part of his success leading the university involved giving all parts of the school’s community – including faculty and the student government – a role in policy decisions, including topics like admissions and tuition costs.
Earlier this month, GW conducted a shared governance survey of faculty, administrators and trustees that found the groups supported more involvement from faculty and administrators in long-term planning. The survey did not mention increased involvement from the Student Association in policymaking.
“The student government association has a huge responsibility and huge authority on our campus,” he said. “It’s not just lip service that we say they have been a part of our shared governance structure. They’re deeply involved when it comes to budget, tuition, fees – their vote is probably the most important point before we go to the Board of Regents and the state legislature.”
