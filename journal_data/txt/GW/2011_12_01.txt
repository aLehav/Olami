Studying during finals doesn’t need to be more of a nightmare than it already is.
If students want a quiet spot on Foggy Bottom, they have to sit in the aging and sterile Gelman Library. That is, if they can even find a spot in the overcrowded study space. And if there is no space in Gelman, students are often hard-pressed to find another comfortable and quiet place on campus to study.
There has been a breakdown between when construction start times on campus and when the University pledged exceptionally noisy construction would start, according to a survey conducted by the Residence Hall Association. While this survey was non-scientific, it points to the fact that students are unhappy with the state of on-campus construction.
Students are here to learn and studying should come before campus expansion for the next three weeks. Even though it is the students’ word against the University’s, administrators should accept that students are bothered by the noise and this will only get worse during finals.
The GW Residence Hall Association has taken laudable efforts throughout the year to ensure that while the construction persists on campus it does not come at the detriment to student productivity today. RHA conducted the survey and organized a petition, which garnered more than 500 signatures, appealing to the University to “uphold its commitment.” Their advocacy work throughout the year is necessary to holding the University’s pledges accountable.
No one is asking for the construction to come to a halt, and the outcome of the campus construction will undoubtedly be beneficial. But we won’t see those results for a long time, and they should not come at the cost of student performance today.

Finals, papers and projects are piling up, and another break sounds ideal right now. It’s easy to lose steam or want to throw in the towel.
But just as students still need to perform at their peak for their finals in the upcoming weeks, professors shouldn’t shirk their teaching responsibilities. Around this time each year, professors begin to cancel classes to allow students the extra hours for time to study or write papers.
This might not be a University-wide problem, but for the courses where professors do choose to cancel classes arbitrarily, students suffer.
Professors have a responsibility to their students, particularly right now, and each course is valuable. Though the value of a lecture or discussion goes beyond monetary metrics, each hour spent in class is worth more than $150 on average, so every time a professor shows up late or disregards his or her teaching responsibilities, students also lose tuition dollars.
If this trend continues, students should make a note of it in their online course evaluations. Course evaluations can also be expanded to include questions specifically pertaining to professors’ attendance and preparedness.
It is troubling how many hours of learning, and how many tuition dollars, are lost to professors cancelling classes at the end of the semester.

Students working on their Clinton Global proposals are encouraged to tap into the University’s network of faculty, departments and programs to strengthen their applications for a highly coveted slot at the spring conference.
About 35 students turned out for the University’s first of two information sessions Wednesday.
“The biggest piece of advice I would give would be to start early, planning and developing your commitment, so you can have plenty of time to utilize the GW resources that are available,” Robert Snyder, the executive director of University initiatives, advised students.
The Center for Undergraduate Fellowships and Research is helping to connect students to faculty in their projects’ fields, Snyder said. He also emphasized the University Writing Center as another way for students to develop their proposals.
Each application, which can be completed by an individual or a group, must include a “commitment,” or formal plan of action to address a global challenge. Applicants must write an essay explaining how the commitment is “new, specific and measurable” – a requirement most students struggle with, Clinton Global director Bill Wetzel said.
Wetzel said the foundation looks for commitments connected to its five focus areas: education, environment, human rights, poverty and public health. The strongest applications not only relate to these themes but also include  “a willingness to take a risk” and “a personal passion and enthusiasm,” in addition to being original, tangible and quantifiable, Wetzel said.
Dean of Students Peter Konwerski urged students to think creatively and reach out to organizations in the D.C. area that align with the focus of a student’s proposal.
He added that the University does not know how many students will be chosen to attend the conference from GW, because the selections will depend on the strength and quantity of applications submitted.
A campus sustainability group, GW Funkstown Food Co-op, is still narrowing down its focus for the proposal and plans to take advantage of the campus’ resources when writing the application.
“Our greatest challenge is creating something that is measurable. We have lofty goals, it is dealing with competition and creating that plan that is difficult,” freshman Haley Burns said.
The deadline for the Clinton Global Initiative University is Jan. 17, and the three-day conference will kick off March 30 next year.
GW is the sixth school to host the university-level conference centered on solving world’s challenges.

Apparently, RateMyProfessors.com is not just a place students go to gripe about their worst classes.
The website provides accurate assessments of performance overall, according to a new study in the electronic journal “Practical Assessment, Research and Evaluation.”
April Bleske-Rechek, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire who co-authored the late November study, said it takes only about 10 evaluations to reach agreement among students.
“There’s a consensus for who’s positive and who’s not,” she said.
She noted that the site’s distinction between quality and easiness improves its accuracy.
Bleske-Rechek, whose students tease her about receiving a chili pepper, signifying attractiveness, on the website, added that the online scores are “highly correlated” with traditional in-class evaluations.
“I would never say the site is flawless, but it can be useful among students,” she said.
More than 1.5 million professors are ranked on the website, which is part of the Viacom conglomerate that owns MTV.
Carlo DiMarco, senior vice president of mtvU university relations, said more than 4 million students visit the site each month.
“With so many students contributing to the site, we feel it’s among the best and most accurate tools for students to judge the performance of professors,” he said. “The site does what students have been doing forever: checking in with each other to figure out who’s a great professor and who’s one you might want to avoid.”
GW administrators remain skeptical about the scores’ legitimacy.
Provost Steven Lerman said RateMyProfessors.com’s rankings rarely play a role in tenure and promotion decisions. University-issued student evaluations and peer reviews by faculty trump comments made on the website, he said, fearing that only students with extreme opinions submit evaluations on Rate My Professors.
“So at least right now, given response rate differential, I’m more comfortable with our own evaluation assessment being a good source of information,” he said. “I’ve never met a professor who got great teacher evaluations who wasn’t a great teacher, and I’ve never met someone who got truly horrible teacher evaluations who wasn’t a bad teacher.”
But in a previous study, Bleske-Rechek found contributors are not only those with extreme opinions, although she acknowledged that inflammatory responses can occur.
Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning Stephen Ehrmann also questioned the validity of the comments on the website.
“It’s important for GW to use evidence that can stand up to the same kinds of standards that we apply to other kinds of research,” he said. “RateMyProfessors.com was created as an information source for students, by students, not as a way to evaluate faculty to help them improve their courses or to decide whom to promote.”
The website’s unofficial capacity on campuses remains strong.
Professor of English Jane Shore has the highest overall ranking of the 2,152 listed professors at GW, with all perfect scores by her 14 student contributors.
“Word of mouth can be pretty useful,” Shore said, although she noted that “it’s not a scientific poll.”
After students suggested several years ago that she read her own comments, Shore began checking her colleagues’ scores for fun on the website – a game she said has always “confirmed her suspicions, good and bad.”
Many students consider the website when preparing to register.
Senior Joshua Friedlander said he used RateMyProfessors.com when planning his courses, except when graduation requirements limited his options.
“I have never contributed to it,” he said. “But I do think that a lot of students use the website before registering for classes.”

When President Barack Obama went book shopping last Saturday, he skipped the disappearing megastores to instead participate in a widespread movement to shop local, favoring a literary pillar of Dupont Cirlce.
“Small Business Saturday,” sponsored and developed by American Express, encourages post-Black Friday holiday shoppers to buy local. Obama took up the call by bringing his daughters to Kramerbooks & Afterwords Café.
Establishing itself as a Washington institution, the restaurant café-meets-bookstore claims to be the first of its kind in the country to feature cappuccino, espresso, a full bar and food. The iconic D.C. bookstore has stood as a staple of Dupont Circle, attracting natives and tourists for nearly 36 years, but it is just one of the locally owned and long-standing bookstores in the District.
Jennifer Ellingston, a long-retired employee of the Library of Congress, has been working at Capitol Hill Books for over 15 years. After wandering in to buy a present for her nephew in 1995, she struck up a conversation with the store’s new owner and soon began volunteering once a week. Thousands of book sales later, she is now getting paid for helping visitors uncover a good read.
Sifting through the estimated 60,000 books held inside the aging Capitol Hill row house can be tricky. Every inch of space is carefully utilized, as secondhand books are stacked from floor to ceiling, creating a “Matilda”-like dream world of well-loved books.
After the first owner passed away, the fate of the local store was unknown. The current owner, retired Navy veteran Jim Toole, couldn’t stand the thought of his neighborhood losing a bookstore and bought the business in 1995.
Without any prior experience as a bibliophile or storeowner, Toole took the reigns.
Toole and Ellingston have watched the rise and fall of bookstore giants like Borders and Barnes & Noble. The former, once with multiple locations, is now completely absent from D.C., and the latter is closing its Georgetown location in January.
Ellingston credits their location, directly across from Eastern Market, for steadily sustaining the business. She personally finds it biologically impossible to think of shopping at a colossal corporate store for any good. “I’m genetically programmed to buy locally,” Ellingston said. “Number one I support small business, number two I support local business.”
At the gateway to Georgetown, Philip Levy, has been running Bridge Street Books for more than 30 years.
By the late 1970s, Levy, then in his early 30s, says he wasn’t going anywhere too fast.
After working various gigs, ranging from a stint with a radical institute to time clocked for Ralph Nader, and later as a messenger and manager at movie theater, he settled on becoming a scholar.
On the way back from a family trip to England, Levy’s brother asked him if he would be interested in opening up a bookstore and made him a deal: if Levy could learn the business, his brother would help him get started.
“I thought, well, if I am going to get in to business, there is nothing I would rather do than sell books,” Levy said.
To learn the book business and hone his customer service skills, Levy got a job making $3.25 an hour at a bookstore in downtown D.C.
“I learned how to act. Even if I didn’t know anything, I learned how to act,” Levy said.
Next to tackle was the question of what to sell.
Levy got the “backlist” – a listing of recommended books for stores to stock from the American Booksellers Association.
“I looked at the list and said, ‘This is not the kind of bookstore I’m going to have. This is like any bookstore. I don’t want to have any bookstore, I want to have a good bookstore,’ ” Levy said.
Instead, for nearly a week, Levy spend five or six hours wandering the shelves of now-closed Olsson’s Books & Records on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown, compiling a list of every title and author of every book he wanted to sell.
“My confusion was if they had a lot of copies of a book, does that mean that’s really important and I’ve got to have it, or does that mean it’s not selling? I had to figure that one out,” Levy said.
In 1980, Levy moved into the store’s current location. His first way to track inventory was a complex index card system with carefully handwritten information stowed away in the back of each book.
From its perch at the edge of Georgetown, Bridge Street Books has withstood waves of mild competition. Levy jokes he is patiently waiting for all other bookstores to exit.
“When we first opened I had this fantasy. I wanted to be the last bookstore left in Washington,” Levy said with a laugh.
Inspired by a local jewelry store that donated its mahogany shelves to the Smithsonian when it closed, Levy hopes his 30-year-old hand crafted bookshelves will one day meet the same end.
“I made a promise when I first started that I would only sell books,” he said. “I’d be a very strange bookstore.”

If you’re planning a trip to Mars, make sure to pack Velveeta macaroni and cheese – 40 boxes of it, to be precise.
In a new exhibit examining space exploration through earthly eyes, Australian artists Sean Cordeiro and Claire Healy blend statistics, American culture and groceries to create a rendering of the common man’s necessities for a hypothetical excursion to Mars.
The first of Cordeiro and Healy’s displays to make it to the United States, “Are We There Yet?” occupies two spaces at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, using nearly 1,500 common grocery products to create a visual manifestation of human consumption.
“Are We There Yet?” utilizes aesthetically-designed stacks of common, ready-made supermarket items, ranging from Marlboro Red cigarettes to Saltine crackers, to create symmetrical hemispheres that are reflected on the gallery’s gold flooring.
“We wanted to set it up so the objects created half a globe on top of a reflective surface. Once you saw the reflective surface, it would visually become a whole sphere. It’s subtle, but it sort of looks like a globe, or a series of planets,” Cordeiro explained.
The endeavor was as much mathematical as it was artistic. To determine the quantities of each product used in the installation, the artists referred to calculations of the total caloric intake one would need to sustain a 520-day voyage to Mars and back. The calculation amounted to a colossal 1,976,000 total calories, an amount represented by all of the food products combined.
The inclusion of 360 cans of Chef Boyardee beef ravioli, 624 cans of Carnation evaporated milk and massive quantities of eight other featured items provides an astounding visual representation of human consumption.
“They’ve recreated a planetary solar system, a cosmological supermarket,” said Beatrice Gralton, the Evelyn S. Nef associate curator of contemporary art.
Cordeiro and Healy referred to published studies of the top 10 most popular grocery products in America to choose the products that would be included in the artistic display. The brands were primarily chosen based upon their ability to remain fresh throughout the entirety of the exhibit.
The gallery’s insertion of aesthetic mounds of beer cans and cheese puffs inadvertently emits a morbidly comical commentary on the average American diet, but the artists note that the intention of the installation is not to provide a social commentary on health.
“I wouldn’t say it’s a comment [on American health], it’s more just a presentation of what we found statistically and factually,” Healy said.
“It doesn’t need to be too didactic, it just is what it is,” Cordeiro said.
Appropriately, the artists drew inspiration from Stanley Kubrick’s iconic film, “2001: A Space Odyssey” when envisioning the spatial layout of the installation. The focal point of the gallery – a space suit donated for the gallery by NASA, laying on a bed – alludes to the final scene of the film.
The presentation arrives at a poignant time in modern culture, coinciding with the recent conclusion of the Mars-500 project and the discontinuation of NASA’s shuttle program.
Marking “mixed feelings” about the conclusion of such ambitious ventures, Healy notes that the quest for space exploration still engages the common man, whose presence is reflected in the mass display of conventional, earthly groceries.
“[The exhibition] is about our mark that we leave on the planet and what we leave behind. We are considering what we consume, but what about the residue after you’ve consumed that thing? Then what happens?” Healy explained.
“Are We There Yet?” is the third presentation in the Corcoran Gallery of Art’s “NOW at the Corcoran” exhibition series, and will remain on display until March 12. All of the products will be donated to food banks and various organizations after the exhibit closes.

Max Romano wanted to be a computer engineer. He liked technology in high school and did well on his science exams.
But within a year of coming to GW, he had changed his mind.
Discouraged by the required lecture-style science and math classes, Romano switched his major before taking a single computer science course. In his move to the GW School of Business, the sophomore sought classes with more interaction and in-depth conversations.
“It didn’t really have to do with the perceived difficulty. I just realized I didn’t want to continue with that [major] here,” Romano said. “So I was like, well I’ll switch my majors like everyone else does.”
Romano is part of a larger group of students who drop science, technology, engineering and math majors to pursue either easier or more discussion-based degrees – a trend that threatens the nation’s ability to stay competitive in scientific innovation.
Across the U.S., 40 percent of students who start as engineering or science majors eventually switch to other subjects or fail out, according to a 2010 study by the University of California at Los Angeles. The drop-off rate climbs to 60 percent for pre-med students.
The number of full-time students who entered the School of Engineering and Applied Science as freshmen and then left for another school at GW increased four-fold from 2006 to 2010, according to data from the Office of Institutional Research.
Almost 10 percent of the total freshman class in SEAS during 2006 transferred out of the program during their four years at GW. For the freshman SEAS class that entered last year, about 28 percent of students have already transferred to another school.
Statistics on transfers by science and math majors in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences is not tracked.
Howard Davis, director of undergraduate student services and advising at the engineering school, said attrition from engineering programs is not just an issue at GW but a national one, adding that the school has been “very diligent in addressing this issue.”
To combat the drop-off rate, Davis said the school uses a combination of professional and faculty advisers to guide freshmen as they progress through degree programs.
Davis attributed the struggle for science, technology, engineering and math majors during their first year at school to the required introductory classes that do not meet their expectations.
“I think, going into the major, students have the tendency to underestimate the amount of prep and focus that it takes to succeed in that major,” Davis said. “When they start doing the course work and the math and science fundamentals, they have a hard time connecting these fundamentals with being a scientist or building a bridge.”
Other students say it is the way that course material is presented that dissuades them from continuing in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field.
“I felt that, if biology and pre-med were truly what I wanted to do with my life, I should be enjoying the classes despite their difficulty, but this just was not happening for me,” sophomore Danielle Leslie, who now studies psychology, said. “I felt overwhelmed and discouraged. I did not enjoy the lectures; labs were fun, but they were not enough to keep me committed.”
The University is targeting science, technology, engineering and math students by pairing all freshmen with upperclassmen of the same major to provide a mentor if freshmen feel overwhelmed. Free walk-in tutoring is also offered to SEAS students for math, chemistry and physics classes within the school.
“I think the fact that the engineering school is a really small school is really helpful to students,” Caroline Battey, a senior majoring in civil engineering, said. Battey, who is president of the engineering sorority Alpha Omega Epsilon, said that experience “definitely tagged me to stay in and offered a support system.”
GW also offers students monetary incentives in the form of lofty scholarships.
Internal data from GW show that 91.1 percent of students entering SEAS received financial aid in 2010. In addition, an engineering-specific $16,000- to $20,000-scholarship is offered through the University-wide Presidential Academic Scholarship program.
This incentive for science, technology, engineering and math majors, Davis said, is the reflection of a growing need for scientists to keep the U.S. competitive.
“As a nation, we need people with those skill sets. Personally, I see it as an obligation to encourage students to do these majors because we are falling behind other countries to produce engineers and scientists.”
