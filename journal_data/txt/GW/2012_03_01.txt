The University’s newest vice president is working to market employee benefits and cut the red tape that bogs down hiring, part of a broader strategy to differentiate GW from similar employers nationwide.
Sabrina Ellis – who assumed the top human resources post in January – said Tuesday that revamping the University’s approach to faculty and staff recruitment is her top priority.
“If we can be ahead of the curve on bringing in talent, then that will help to ensure that we’re making traction in our larger strategies,” Ellis said.
She called the current recruitment process “unwieldy,” pointing to lengthy searches and complex collaboration between HR and individual departments.
Searches for new employees are conducted through a University website but the listing cannot be posted until both offices involved agree on a description. Ellis said this internal review process can be trimmed to increase efficiency.
“I’m looking at, in HR, developing a metric where, when a department makes a determination that they need to fill a job, that we in HR are able to move that position through the various steps in the process,” Ellis said, citing posting the job, attracting a strong applicant pool and facilitating a smooth transition once a candidate is chosen as necessary measures in the process.
She said her approach will reduce the time between the opening of vacancies and final hiring decisions by “unclogging the bottleneck that currently exists” with administrative processes in the Office of Human Resources.
A streamlined recruitment process would allow for more applicants, which Ellis believes will help make national searches more rewarding.
Her strategy will also emphasize the advantages of a career at GW – including its location and the use of campus facilities. She hopes to entice the strongest candidates by initiating a discussion of retirement and health benefits earlier in the hiring process.
Candidate engagement – the process through which the University pitches itself to desirable applicants – will be formalized through tours of facilities and the neighborhood, Ellis said.
“I would want them to understand what full University citizenship includes,” she said.
Hiring will be geared toward specific communities, like veterans, to garner interest among qualified applicants, Ellis said. The Returning Heroes Tax Credit, a national program signed into law by President Barack Obama in November 2011, reduces the federal tax burden of any business that hires unemployed veterans.
The University is accepting applicants for more than 100 faculty and staff positions, six of which are at the senior management level. Openings include a director for the University Counseling Center, several fundraising administrators and a vice provost of budget and finance.
GW is also looking to hire an executive director of talent acquisition, a position Ellis hopes to fill by “early spring.” That administrator will be responsible for developing a strategy to manage recruitment, evaluate weaknesses in the GW workforce and improve the University’s reputation as an employer.
Ellis said that GW competes for prospective employees with Syracuse, Duke and Northwestern Universities, among others.
A more hands-on approach to recruitment will facilitate hiring across the University’s academic and administrative departments, Ellis said.
“What I see is building a competency at GW that can be used across all areas. So if we have an effective talent management strategy and talent acquisition strategy, then we should be able to deploy that strategy for engineering, for the humanities, for technology, for administration,” she said.
Ellis’ efforts fall in line with University President Steven Knapp’s goal to make GW “a place where everyone wants to work,” which he emphasized in December before Ellis assumed the vice presidency.

Gayle Wald hears from students that the arts at GW have an identity problem.
Without a single hub, campus academic departments and stage venues are expanding programming and unifying their message to prove the University can be a destination for the arts.
“People think this town is about what happens on the Hill or at the White House or in office buildings on K Street, but it’s really a rich city for music, for dance, for theater, and there’s a solid literary community as well,” Wald, chair of the English department, said.
The arts initiative, launched by faculty and administrators to stir a renaissance, will start by bringing artists who perform at Lisner Auditorium inside the classroom next fall. The University’s first summer arts program will also link academic and extracurricular offerings on campus for high school and college students this year.
University President Steven Knapp pitched a review of GW’s arts programs in 2010, which was carried out by department heads and professors. Columbian College of Arts and Sciences Dean Peg Barratt said an arts initiative would combine GW’s “disparate” academic and non-academic arts programs on campus.
While arts professors and students lament the lack of physical space for collaboration – additions Barratt said are not in the works – Lisner Auditorium will look to coordinate classroom appearances with the artists it books for its upcoming fall schedule. Details for the collaboration are still being worked out, Assistant Vice President for Events and Venues Michael Peller said.
“There is a need for a performance venue, so Lisner will sort of be part of a supporting cast for the initiative,” Peller said.
Students said spaces like Lisner Auditorium and the Classroom 102 art gallery have supplemented lagging academic facilities.
Francesca Downs, a first-year master of fine arts student, said the Smith Hall of Art does not hold enough drawing or painting rooms.
“It’s hard to thrive and be creative in such a terrible building,” she said. “It doesn’t even feel like an arts building.”
With no sign of new spaces, arts professors said the University uses resources across Foggy Bottom and D.C. to showcase its creativity.
Alan Wade, a theater professor, said while collaboration efforts should be applauded, the departments remain sprawled.
“The sorts of improvements I envision would require considerable financial resources, so I don’t see these changes happening soon,” Wade said.
For the summer program, GW will connect departments in Columbian College with the Graduate School of Education and Human Development’s museum education program, the Luther W. Brady Art Gallery and Lisner Auditorium.
The summer arts initiative will include about 20 arts courses during the two regular summer sessions, spanning fine arts and art history to English, music, theater and dance.
It will also include five summer abroad courses – two of which are brand new – and one summer institute in American Indian art therapy, as well as three courses for high school students. Not all courses will offer academic credit, which Barratt said is typical for summer college programs.
Courses will highlight subjects like digital art, post-modern dance, ceramic design, creative writing, art and architecture, musical performance and photojournalism. One new for-credit course open to high school students will focus on art and politics.
The summer arts initiative and efforts to bring the Textile Museum to Foggy Bottom are the first traces of a push to remake the image of the GW’s creative programs, Vice President of Research Leo Chalupa said.
Recent partnerships with the Phillips Collection in Dupont Circle and Arena Stage in southwest D.C. would also branch GW’s program out into the city, Chalupa said.
“The reputation that GW had until recently is that it had strength in policy and law school,” Chalupa said. “The arts initiative, and a lot of the other initiatives [being led by the office of research], is meant to increase the reputation and the strength of this University and these other areas where we have excellence as well.”

In “George Washington’s Birthday” Feb. 27, p.4, The Hatchet commended the University for hosting centennial celebrations in February marking the George Washington University’s 100 years in Foggy Bottom, but questioned why the University did not hold a rally or block party. Celebratory events are going to be taking place throughout the year until October, including a block party.
Last week, GW launched a campaign to celebrate and recognize the anniversary of 100 years in Foggy Bottom. Kick-off events included an exhibit in the Luther Brady gallery called “Seen in Foggy Bottom,” which features scenes from the neighborhood.
On George Washington’s birthday, President Steven Knapp and a group of students participated in a wreath-laying ceremony for the University’s namesake at the Mount Vernon Estate, Gardens and Museum. Later that night, hundreds of students, faculty, staff, alumni and neighbors helped launch the centennial at the birthday bonfire.
The next day, the University hosted a special program that sought to reveal the man behind the myth that is General Washington. This week, we heard from long-term Foggy Bottom residents who reflected on the changes in Washington and in their lives as part of the panel discussion “Voices: Celebrating the African American Legacy in Foggy Bottom.”   These programs were just the beginning for a large committee made up of students, faculty, staff and neighbors, who planned the commemoration. Our Foggy Bottom Centennial celebrations continue throughout 2012 culminating with the Foggy Bottom/West End block party in October.
 You can read about our rich history in a special GW Magazine supplement which can be found online and on campus. Look for stories in GW Today that cover the decades since our relocation.  Or stop by the “A Century of Change: One Hundred Years of GW in Foggy Bottom” exhibit in the Media and Public Affairs Building. Sign up for the Foggy Bottom Historical Walking Tour History Hunt taking place March 3. Soak up GW’s rich history and imagine what the neighborhood will look like 100 years from now.
The celebrations didn’t end last week. They have only just begun.
  Lorraine A.Voles
Vice President for External Relations

Today is the last day to vote in the runoff election for Student Association president, and The Hatchet’s editorial board would like to re-affirm its support for John Bennett as president.
Bennett and his competitor Ashwin Narla are both strong candidates, who bring unique sets of skills and strengths to the race. But we believe Bennett is the better candidate for the post.
Bennett is a truly impressive candidate with a long history of student advocacy and a generally comprehensive plan for arriving at his goals. His platform strikes a healthy balance between tasks that can be achieved quickly and those that require a year’s worth of advocacy. More importantly, he has the strategy to accomplish both. His plan to get SA Senators more involved and motivated by including them in upper-level advocacy efforts is a smart response to the SA Senate’s typical apathy. It also speaks to his own high-impact term as SA finance chair this year, during which he reformed the financial allocation process and notably kept open dialogues with the many student organizations on campus by holding well-attended town halls.
We are confident Bennett would be able to negotiate the University bureaucracy to push his agenda and make the right connections to achieve his goals. Not only does Bennett have knowledge of campus issues, but also he knows how to apply it. His plan to revitalize Columbian Square, for example, which includes bringing in new furniture and making the area more inviting, is an efficient short-term response to the current lack of student space. Also, when pressed on the infeasibility of one point of his safety and security platform, he was willing to be flexible on its details as long as student safety did not suffer.
Bennett’s performance during the student media debate did not merely exemplify the success he’s had in his current role as SA finance chair. When posed questions about student life issues that weren’t mentioned in his platform, such as how to ensure that campus groups are accepting of GW’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, he responded with a smart and effective solution by suggesting requiring major student organizations to complete Safe Zone training.
We still worry Bennett is not willing enough to ask for the counsel of the students whose votes he seeks. There is no denying he has a huge ego, and while this might fuel a tenacious students-first lobbying agenda, he must make it clearer that he would continue to seek student input. But we have confidence that, if elected, Bennett would bring about important change during his one-year term.
Narla has made frequent communication with the student body the focal point of his campaign. Often, Student Association executives become so entrenched in their efforts that they lose sight of the students they are serving. But Narla’s strong, students-first platform and his plans to hold frequent “State of the Campus” updates reassures us that he would keep his ear to the ground and maintain dialogue with his peers. Narla’s attitude about the sort of chief lobbyist he would be is one of the greatest strengths of his platform.
He asserts that he wouldn’t just work with administrators as one student taking on the University, but also, through his outreach, he would mobilize the student body to be involved in initiatives and lobbying efforts. In the week between the general election and the runoff, it was encouraging to see Narla continue to tweak his platform and goals, such as putting in a specific timeline for accomplishing his plan to implement a student organizartion calendar. By attempting to further outline his ideas and provide additional detail, Narla demonstrated that he would be able to remain responsive and adaptable to any unforeseen problems or issues that could arise throughout his term.
We were very impressed by his fervor and charisma during his endorsement hearing – he certainly has the magic – but during the debate, it became clear that his platform lacks serious substance beyond plans for frequent student outreach.
Narla’s infectious personality and commitment to improving student life would make him an excellent lobbyist. We were disappointed to find that his initial platform and ideas weren’t developed enough to match the strength of his passion and desire to lead the student body.
While both finalists for this year’s presidential race are exceptional, there is only one who can provide real results as next year’s SA president. Vote John Bennett for SA president.

As the educators of the Baby Boomer generation peter into retirement, a dark hole will grow in America’s teacher corps.
U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan called on the imminent need for “1 million new great teachers” on “The Daily Show with John Stewart” Feb. 16 to replace the 50 percent of teachers expected to retire in the next decade.
According to Duncan, that is a staggering 1.8 million teachers leaving the field.
Clearly there is a dire need for more college-age students to take an interest in teaching, or the future of public education nationwide will be in peril.
And some of America’s future teachers might be part of GW’s undergraduate population right now, studying international affairs or business.
But these students should be able to, even at the undergraduate level, identify as aspiring teachers.
The University should offer curricular opportunities for undergraduates interested in the field of education. The Graduate School of Education and Human Development is the 35th-best education studies graduate program in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report. The undergraduate population is also teeming with potential teachers, evidenced by the increasing number of seniors who apply to Teach for America each year.
But how might undergraduates realize their passion for teaching if they can’t explore the field until they graduate?
It is not only practical but absolutely crucial that GSEHD partners with undergraduate academic programs.
Harvard College has already begun a popular and effective undergraduate program linked with its Graduate School of Education. The Undergraduate Teacher Education Program there provides undergraduates with four semester-long courses including psychology and curriculum planning in conjunction with the Graduate School of Education. It also has a practical portion consisting of 78 hours of classroom observation.
At the end of the program, UTEP students have the credentials to teach at public middle and elementary schools across the country. And, while the course load is light enough to fit in with an undergraduate schedule, it can count toward graduate credit if students go on to pursue a master’s degree in education.
GW has the educators and the students, and D.C. has dozens of schools in need of passionate undergraduates. If GSEHD teams up with the undergraduate curriculum, the University could feasibly replicate Harvard’s undergraduate education program.
The higher education administration faculty teaches undergraduate classes to draw interest in masters programs in higher education, Carol Kochhar-Bryant, the graduate school’s senior associate dean, said.
But that doesn’t combat the diminishing number of Kindergarten through 12th grade teachers, and that is why a joint program with GSEHD is so crucial at GW.
Not everyone who wants to be a teacher knows it from the start.
This exposure at an undergraduate level to teaching and education might spark an interest in students and lead them to pursue it as a career path. Allowing GSEHD to team up with an undergraduate curriculum will allow students across the University to pursue a passion for teaching without necessarily committing to a master’s degree program in it.

The zombies are here.
These ones, however, do not feast on flesh; they walk mindlessly from class to class, through University Yard or Kogan Plaza, practically void of all emotion.
Believe it or not, Student Association elections injected a dose of excitement and energy that seemed to wake the walking dead on campus and return them to their human form.
From the colorful poster-lined walls of Phillips and Rome Halls and the Marvin Center to the campaigning, a sense of spirit was added to the student body last week. With the run-off election for SA President occurring today – the walls will soon be stripped, and the palm cards will be a thing of the past – it seems as though there is nothing that is coming up soon to excite the student body.
We need another event that can help bring students together and pump some much-needed energy into the fast approaching mid-term season.
GW hosted a bonfire Feb. 22 celebrating George Washington’s Birthday in University Yard, but its turnout lacked true University-wide representation. It hardly made me more excited for the centennial celebration than any other year’s George Washington birthday bonfire.
Basketball games rarely receive enough attention to garner campus-wide support, and Spring Fling, an event that brings together a large portion of the student body, isn’t until the middle of April. So the question remains: How can the University spark the student body’s interest to bring them together between now and then?
Plan something that cannot be avoided.
Why not sponsor a campus-wide celebration? Shut down the streets in front of Gelman Library, take over Kogan Plaza and pack it with students overflowing with spirit and excitement. We’ve seen how students show up for the annual spring chalking day. The University should channel that sort of commitment to making the campus cohesive and GW-focused for another day.
Student organizations and administrators, particularly the Center for Student Engagement, could work hand in hand to create a party fit for Washington himself; it just has to be something that students want to attend.
Now of course, this mix of GW’s best events probably couldn’t come together in the next few months, so campus groups and the University should start planning for a blowout event for next year.
The key to the election season’s appeal is a combination of appeasing the student’s political interests and putting them front and center. It is true that, despite the constant reminders, many do not vote and, to put it simply, do not care about the SA election, the candidates or the results. But even the most apathetic student cannot deny the surplus of excitement that accompanies election season.
Nothing that I have experienced at GW, so far, has been so unapologetically in-your-face, and that’s what makes elections so appealing. You can’t avoid the overwhelming sense of being a part of something other than collective misery over exams and research papers. Amidst the internships and city living, it takes just a few posters and three days’ worth of handouts to bring out the inner school spirit that lies dormant in all of us.
I am done walking through the masses of zombies; it is time to bring GW back to life, one spirit-filled blowout at a time.

Devoting space for students on the Marvin Center fifth floor is no longer up for negotiation, so now is the time to focus on the other resources the University can offer for a student life space.
And there’s a slot on campus about to open up right before our eyes: Old Main.
The building on the corner of 20th and F streets, which currently houses the career center, classrooms and a few academic departments, will be moving its career services offices to the Marvin Center fifth floor.
Right now, students are clamoring for collaborative organization space, and the University needs to open its doors to this purpose instead of adding more classrooms and offices to fill Old Main’s vacancy. With only the top 57 student organizations receiving office space in the Marvin Center, the University must extend its efforts to the other 383 student organizations.
Instead of converting Old Main into classroom space, the University should use the extra space as a large, collective center for smaller clubs and organizations that don’t have permanent space.
By opening Old Main to the community of organizations formerly working out of closets and dorm rooms, the University can revitalize campus life. College life should be all about finding your niche, and for some people, part of aligning with that niche has unfortunately been sitting on a sidewalk begging for space.
Creating a collaborative environment for students will bring meetings to life and add a splash of color to Old Main. The timeworn feeling of the building needs a pick-me-up, and the frequent milling of eager student organizations is just the spark of life needed to help the building breathe in some fresh air. All it needs is a small renovation and the creativity supplied by the University’s finest innovators: its students.
Old Main may not be on the wondrous H Street – the Broadway of GW – but right now, students need any space they can get. The University needs to stop closing off resources to the community, and instead expand on what it has to offer. Don’t limit resources to the Marvin Center: Build outside of the “student union,” and allow the strength of the community to grow with it.
