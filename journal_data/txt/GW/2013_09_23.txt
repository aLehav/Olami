Senior Jane Wallis admits her second-half goal to break a tie on Friday night was “not pretty.”
But when you break the goal down, it impresses. The shot from the top of the box in the 66th minute did not even elicit a dive from Howard’s goalkeeper, who watched the ball sail into the back of the net. It prevented GW from falling into a fourth straight tie.
And Wallis did it with a dislocated shoulder.
“The thing you love about Jane is how competitive and feisty and fiery she is. So you know you can use her somewhere. Tonight is a good example,” head coach Sarah Barnes said.
Wallis’ goal led to another in the second half, as a more fluid offense came alive, leading the Colonials to a 3-1 win over the Bison. GW would compile 15 shots in the night, seven on goal, and 11 corner kicks.
The breakthrough came at the right time for GW.
“We had really been going at them and they had been sitting in, sitting in, sitting in. We were just trying to take shots and it wasn’t my prettiest shot but it went in,” Wallis said. “Especially last couple weeks coaches have been talking to me about leaning over the ball and getting the ball in frame and I tried to do that a few times tonight, and it went in.”
Against a Howard team known for its physicality, many of the Colonials played with extra intensity. Wallis, who added that she did not know she had dislocated when Barnes played in the second half, said she had been pushed down hard several times during the game.
Sophomore Brooke Bean scored the team’s first goal in the 31st minute. She took a quick pass by junior Nicole Belfonti, who played off the bench after sitting out the last game due to a cold, and turned around a defender in the middle of the box. With the goalie up, Bean passed it into the right back corner of the goal to take a 1-0 lead.
“All through the beginning we had good opportunities. We just had to keep pushing and keep shooting and contesting the keeper and eventually something went in,” Bean said.
The team maintained possession most of the first half, but slipped up in the 38th minute. A Bison forward came sprinting down the field and was tripped up slightly in the box to earn a free kick. She kicked it just out the reach of a diving senior goalkeeper Nicole Ulrick.
“It was disappointing but obviously hindsight is 20/20. It was a good challenge for us to have a sort of difficult situation, an obstacle and overcome it. Those are the kinds of things that I’m sure will happen during conference so it’s a good lesson for us,” Barnes said.
After Wallis broke the tie 20 minutes into the second half, freshman Lina Proska added to the lead, putting away the Bison with her quick shot from around 20 yards back.
“I was just sprinting as fast as I could down the field and then I screamed at Kyla to pass me the ball and I just kind of shot it. I wasn’t really expecting for it to go in, but it just went in,” Proska said.
The Colonials were glad to finally put a tally in the win column.
It was their first win since Sept. 6 against Old Dominion. Despite the drought in wins, they were close to a win against William & Mary, but the game was canceled due to lightning three minutes before it would have counted.
“I think we’ve had really similar games in terms of dominating over the last several and we kind of walked away with a sour taste in our mouths. So it was really good to get a win tonight for sure,” Barnes said.
GW improved to 7-0-1 against Howard over the lifetime series. The Colonials will start A-10 play in a week, starting on the road at Rhode Island next Friday.

Senior forward Tyler Ranalli has been the main bright spot for the Colonials this season. 
By Nora Princiotti | Hatchet Reporter

Tyler Ranalli plays every game to prove a point: He is not the same young player on a losing team.
The senior co-captain is lighting up the stat sheet for the Colonials this year, amassing half the team’s goals thus far. His drive to succeed, he said, may come as a force of habit. Throughout his life on the pitch, coaches have continually underestimated him and set low expectations, he said.
“I’ve always played with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder. I’ve never gotten the respect that I feel like I deserve,” he said.
It’s clear that the Ohio native doesn’t let memories of soccer failure fade, remembering specific details of each season going back to elementary school. “My teams were never good. When I was eight, we lost every game. When I was nine, we won one game,” he said.
Even all the way back to when he was four years old, Ranalli said his soccer career has not always enjoyed much success. “I had a lot of fun playing it, but I wasn’t very good. I was slow,” Ranalli said, jokingly.
And when he was 16, he switched positions to forward, just to show his coaches that he should get a chance on the field.
This year, Ranalli is single-handedly trying to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself. The Colonials have a losing record of 3-4, though, and have their work cut out for them to make something of this season. The team is trying to rebound from a 5-13 season last year.
But Ranalli’s play, with five goals and three assists, has been a highlight. Against VMI two weeks ago, Ranalli netted a hat trick and tacked on an assist in the Colonials’ 4-0 rout. In the next game against UMBC, he scored once more.
Like when he was younger, Ranalli still guides his play with the mantra “be prepared,” putting in two to three extra hours on the practice field every week.
He wants “to be the one person that my teammates” can rely on, he said. “That pushes me to try to prepare and do as much as I possibly can, so that I’m the most prepared person on the field – so that when it comes time, I won’t let anyone down,” Ranalli added.
His work – this season especially, after GW finished at the bottom of the Atlantic 10 last year – has not gone unnoticed by head coach Craig Jones.
“This season in particular he has spent a lot of time working with the coaches, just hitting balls,” Jones said. “On the field, his preparation and how he trains for the game – he leads by example.”
Jones described what motivates the co-captain in simple terms: “Scoring goals.”
“In past years he would probably say he didn’t score as many goals as he would have liked, but then we’ve used him in a deeper position, so he’s overall been used in a much deeper role and he’s done great for us,” Jones said.
The drive prompted his coach to transition Ranalli fully to the forward position, after playing at midfield for much of last season.  Ranalli’s personal history suggests that this may yield good results.
“When I was 16, the team I played for, I wasn’t really good enough to start at center midfielder so the coach asked me to start at forward. I think I scored five goals in the first three games, so they told me I could play forward,” Ranalli said.
Ranalli has started every game of the season as a forward this year, and seems to be making up for lost time in the goal department.
Still, the Colonials have lost three of their last four games and Ranalli will need to keep practicing, and get some help from his teammates, if he wants to avoid being on a losing team again.
“I know that I’ll take the time during the week to go out and do the extra practice, because I know I need to keep improving, and I have confidence – because I’m doing all this extra [practice]a – that I’ll be better than the people I’m playing,” Ranalli said.

Hundreds of sorority women welcomed new members with cheers and songs on the National Mall on Tuesday, bringing the female Greek population to its highest level yet.
Holding cutouts of their chapter letters and clad in neon t-shirts, nearly 25 percent more women received invitations to join one of Panhellenic Association’s 11 chapters this year after turnout slumped last fall.
About 40 more women participated in recruitment this year, with a far greater chance of receiving a bid. About 78 percent of the 650 women were invited to join a chapter, compared to 67 percent last year.
“I never thought being recruited for a sorority would be so much work. I have never experienced so many emotions simultaneously,” said Klaire Spielberg, a freshman who joined Alpha Delta Pi.
“Bid Day” was held on the National Mall for the first time. Dozens of tourists looked on as chapters greeted their newest members on a field near the Lincoln Memorial.
Rachael Abram, president of the GW Panhellenic Association, said the move made recruitment more of a GW experience.
“It made freshmen girls feel a little more welcome in DC and more, maybe, inclined to explore the city and feeling like D.C. is their home as much as GW is their home,” Abram said.
It was also the first fall recruitment with GW’s newest sorority, Kappa Delta. The year-old chapter offered 54 bids – the most out of any other sorority.
“We were brought here to add something to Greek life on campus. We want to stand out, not in a better way, but as who we are,” Kappa Delta president Joanna Rodriguez said.
Sororities invited an average of 46 members after the five-day recruitment process. Panhel added an extra day last spring to give new members an additional night to visit each chapter.
Like in years past, freshmen snatched the most bids, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all invitations. Sororities also offered bids to 93 sophomores, 11 juniors and one senior.
The high turnout came close to reaching the records sororities set two years ago, when 512 of the 715 women registered for recruitment received bids.
Phi Sigma Sigma extended bids to just 39 members, the least of all chapters.

A customer service staffer filed a lawsuit against the University last week claiming she was passed over for a promotion because of racial and age discrimination.
Mona Bernard, a 54-year-old black woman, alleged that GW hired a less-qualified and younger white woman, which caused Bernard pain and suffering, according to court documents filed Sept. 17. She is demanding the University promote her and award her compensation for the pay she would have received if she had been promoted initially.
Her complaint calls GW’s actions “malicious, willful, wanton and in reckless disregard” of her rights.
She alleges her director, Jim Schrote, who is white, chose a “demonstrably less qualified” woman who lacked a college degree and had only worked at GW for two years.
Bernard, an 18-year employee of the University who holds a masters of business administration, manages work orders and the University’s key depot offices.
Schrote declined to comment on the claims.
Bernard, who has held the same position since 2006, wrote in her complaint that her supervisors failed to notify her that someone else had received the job, and she instead learned about the decision after an email was accidentally sent to her. Bernard and her attorney did not immediately return a request for comment.
When she asked Schrote why he denied her the promotion, Bernard claims he responded that the other woman had “more creative ideas.”
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to comment, citing GW’s policy to not comment on pending litigation.
D.C. Superior Court has scheduled an initial conference for Dec. 20.

Despite Loyola Maryland scoring on its own goal in the first half, the women’s soccer team could not push across a goal of its own, finishing in a 1-1 tie against the Greyhounds on Tuesday.
Not including the Colonials’ canceled game against William and Mary last week, this was the team’s third straight double-overtime tie.
“Realistically, I think at this point, with three ties, I think we just need to work on finishing,” senior goalkeeper Nicole Ulrick said. “These are the kinds of games that last year we might have let slip through our fingers. So we’ve been pretty tight defensively, not losing focus or letting chances come up with goals.”
Early on though, it seemed as if the Colonials’ (2-2-3) return to the Mount Vernon Campus after four straight road games had brought them some luck. In the 18th minute, after a free kick by junior Elizabeth Casey was stopped by a defender, the ball bounced around the box to the confusion of just about everyone and resulted in a Loyola (1-6-2) player accidentally kicking the ball backwards into her own net.
For the rest of the game, the Colonials greatest struggle of the season – scoring – resurfaced. Although they significantly outshot Loyola by 19-8, the Colonials could not convert any of their five shots on goal.
“We have to do a better job of having good composure. I think that’s the bottom line. Is it youth? I think for some of them, yes,” head coach Sarah Barnes said. “But in general, if we’re composed, we take our time, we pick our head up and look, you have the time to pass the ball into the goal.”
Even though GW was unsuccessful in finding the back of the net, the team maintained its 1-0 lead deep into the second half. When her team came out in the second half, Barnes said, they looked to continue to be aggressive while keeping a controlled passing game.
GW had every opportunity to score a second goal, holding possession for the majority of the game. When they did get in the box, which was fairly often, the Colonials could not convert. Sophomore Kristi Abbate wowed the attack with skillful footwork and solid touch passes, all on her way to a team-leading two shots on goal with three total shots.
“Maybe I had some nice passes here and there, but it didn’t really matter because it comes down to finishing,” Abbate said.
A lapse in the defense, though, resulted in the Greyhounds finding a week spot at the left side of the net and wrapping a shot right inside the left post.
“In hindsight, I wish I came out and just went for her instead of setting, hoping that I’d get the shot, but it happened. I think what was more disappointing isn’t the goal, it’s that we had so many opportunities to come back and we just couldn’t put anything away,” Ulrick said.
A crucial moment of the game came with 35 seconds to go in regulation when senior Melanie Keer passed to junior Alex Brothers, who then quickly found Abbate past midfield. Abbate turned one defender and crossed another, leaving her with a fairly open left side of the box to strike the winning goal. A blind-sided trip from behind, though – uncalled by the referee, to dismay of the Colonials – ended the threat.
The missed opportunity reassured Abbate of her need to start finding the net for her team.
“Just put my head down and strike the ball. I have to stop staring at where the goalie is because I think it’s starting to throw me off. I’m in my own head right now; the coaches tell me all the time. I’ll be out here tomorrow morning, working on my shot, because I need to.” Abbate said.
Neither team could find a rhythm in either overtime period, as the uptempo pace by both teams tapered the other from taking a shot. In the final 10-minute period, GW had a few more chances, including a cross from the right corner that passed in front of the goal line, but no one was there to finish it.
“They got one chance, and had the composure to finish, and we had 19 chances, and we didn’t have the composure to finish. So that’s disappointing,” Barnes said.
The Colonials were short one: Junior Nicole Belfonti sat out the game after not practicing all week due to a cold, Barnes said. She said she is expected to play against Howard on Friday – the team’s final game before Atlantic 10 conference play starts Oct. 4.
“We just really need to clean up shooting and just finishing. If we have 10 shots, we need to put one away,” Ulrick said. “Ties are better than losses, but its starting to feel like we need to win.”

After four years on the track at Notre Dame, you’d think graduate student Angela Ryck would be tired of running.
But after getting off to a late start on the cross country team in South Bend, Ryck now has unfinished business left on the race course for GW. After a successful career for the Fighting Irish, Ryck still has NCAA eligibility running cross country, and she plans to soak it up.
“According to my parents, I could run before I could walk,” Ryck joked.
In just her third 6,000-meter race and second time competing for GW, Ryck finished with a time of 23:06.00 at the Catholic University Invitational earlier this month, enough to give her the first place award and propel GW to a second-place finish out of six teams.
So far, her skills have brought dividends that head coach Terry Weir did not forsee when he spoke to Ryck about competing at GW.
“I spoke to her briefly after speaking with her coach and she was really looking forward to running a full season in cross country,” Weir said.
Emerging as a middle-distance track runner on Notre Dame’s 30-woman track team, Ryck’s best finish during her senior year came at the 5K JV National Catholic Championships, where she finished second out of 104 runners with a time of 18:30.2. Her best time would come at her next race, the 5K Gold Race at the Notre Dame Invitational, with a time of 18:05, good enough for a 13th place finish out of 116 runners.
“I’ll always have that Irish spirit in me,” Ryck said. “But I’m excited to gain a new perspective here at GW and be part of a program where I can contribute and continue to improve.”
As a mid- and long-distance specialist, having Weir as a head coach appears to be a perfect fit for Ryck, who did not start competing in longer distance races until her junior year at Notre Dame. Despite only a few months of training together, Ryck has already bought into the strategies of her new coach.
“My background is more of a middle-distance track athlete,” she said, “So cross country is something that I’ve started to get the hang of more recently.”
Weir and Ryck’s strategy for the CUI worked perfectly – as reflected in her results. The plan was for Ryck to maintain her speed and stay toward the back of the group throughout the race. By the halfway point, she could then use her saved energy to catch up to the runners in the lead and hopefully pass them.
“It’s a good feeling,” Ryck said about seeing the checkered tape at the end of CUI. “As soon as you see the finish line, you know the pain will be gone soon.”
The dedication to training and wanting to race for a fifth year is a testament to Ryck’s passion that may have stemmed from her first love: music. She has played the violin for 19 years and joined GW’s orchestra upon arrival.
She also is also working on getting her masters in public health, which she cited as her main reason for coming to GW. Drawing from her experience as an athlete, Ryck’s concentration is physical activity, but she wants to expand her field of study to include prevention of diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
With her next checkpoints in mind, Ryck will remain at GW long after she is done racing this season. But Weir envisions Ryck’s one year paying off big time for the program.
“Angela came from a top 10 track/cross country program at Notre Dame. It’s great for our younger or inexperienced runners to hear that some of the things they are going through, go on at these top programs too,” Weir said. “She is exactly the student-athlete I think we can attract to GW.”

The other weekend at an off-campus apartment party, I eavesdropped on a small group of guys huddled and talking about feminism. “Why do girls still talk about feminism? It’s not like they need it anymore. They’re equal, anyway,” I heard them saying.
The consensus among those not particularly interested in women’s issues, depressingly, is that feminism is irrelevant.
Many of us shy away from the word “feminism.”  In fact, even though many people support women’s equality, only 14 percent of the population consider themselves “feminists,” according to an April YouGov/Huffington Post poll. Frustratingly, that number is a mere 9 percent when only men are surveyed.
Feminism is a word with negative connotations and those who subscribe to it are often viewed as extremists. That’s a disturbing misconception, considering how far women’s equality still has to go.
But for those of you at the party this weekend – and for anyone else who might be confused – here’s a quick lesson: “A feminist is someone who stands up for equality and speaks out against injustice,” Rachel Riedner, associate professor of writing and women’s studies, told me.
It means nothing less and nothing more.
It is the solution to the problems that women experience every day, including but certainly not limited to sexual assault, domestic violence, salary disparities and underrepresentation.
As the nation’s capital, you’d think District would lead the country in equality and progressive policy. But although it is ahead of the game on issues like gay rights and medical marijuana, it is behind the curve on gender equality.
In January, the Human Rights Watch released a study declaring that D.C. Metro Police have mishandled as many as 170 rape and sexual assault cases, including some that were ignored completely. Without external oversight, advocates argue, District police can get away with picking and choosing which sexual violence crimes they want to investigate.
Yet, one in four D.C. women are expected to experience domestic violence in their lifetimes. And the 89 women in Congress make up a meager 20 percent of the Senate and about 18 percent of the House.
D.C. isn’t leading the nation in the feminist movement, but neither is GW.
To be fair, there are some promising signs.
The University has a very active Feminist Student Union, a female Student Association President and many progressive, tuned-in students dedicated to bettering the welfare of women. Additionally, GW has recently reformed its sexual assault policy, giving survivors an unlimited time to report crimes.
But as one of the most politically active universities in the country, this simply isn’t enough. Underrepresentation is one of the biggest issues that women face, and it is alarming that our university is participating in an overwhelming problem.
The University has a serious problem with inequality among administrators as well as professors – and inequality in leadership reflects poorly on GW’s reputation.
The Hatchet reported in April that GW is slowly making gains as it attempts to hire more female as well as racially diverse professors. But as of last year, only 40 percent of professors here were female. The University does hire a fair amount of female professors, but many of our older and more experienced professors are male.
This is frustrating given that today, females account for more than 50 percent of Ph.D.’s from American universities, but on average, only 41 percent of undergraduate and master’s level college professors across the country are female.
GW should be ahead of the curve instead of merely being average. A way to do this is by creating more endowed chairs for female professors: Female faculty only hold 14 percent of GW’s 80 endowed slots.
And is an even more serious problem with the University’s administration. Out of the top 15 highest paid administrators in 2012, only two were female.
Just as leaders in Congress should be working harder to lead the country in the right direction on women’s equality, it’s essential that our administration is a trailblazer in the eyes of universities and administrations across the nation – and it’s disheartening that strides on this issue haven’t been made already.
So we need feminism.
We need our administrators to start the dialogue about women’s issues. And as students, we’re ignoring a huge problem if we don’t encourage them to do so.

A new three-year, $350,000 entrepreneurship program will help students start companies that tackle global problems rather than only seek profits.
The University launched “GWupstart” last week and hired a social entrepreneurship coordinator who will lead workshops and advise students competing for a total of $65,000 in cash prizes over the next three years. The program fulfills the University’s commitment to action after hosting the Clinton Global Initiative University conference in 2012.
“We have so many students here who just have great ideas and are just passionate about their different causes and we want to be able to support them,” said Jim Chung, executive director of the Office of Entrepreneurship.
Student-run social ventures will compete for a $15,000 prize, split evenly among the top for-profit and non-profit competitors in a new track of GW’s annual Business Plan Competition. The awards will increase to $25,000 for each of the next two years of competition.
In addition to the awards, the $350,000 program pays for the new coordinator’s salary for three years, as well as programming and marketing.
Melanie Fedri, the new social entrepreneurship coordinator, will serve as a resource for students interested in diving into social ventures. Her workshops will also draw on the University’s network of alumni and local entrepreneurs who can mentor students, similar to programs run out of the Office of Entrepreneurship.
Fedri, who is currently working toward a Ph.D. in higher education at Pennsylvania State University, said she became involved with social innovation groups because of the “close to the ground” approach to taking on social issues.
“Young people and the world are looking for new ways to tackle these seemingly intractable problems,” Fedri said.
She added that GW’s socially minded students are an ideal crop to launch ventures. GW typically ranks high on lists that measure students and graduates most involved in politics, Teach for America, the Peace Corps and the armed forces.
The high number of students who participated in the Clinton Global Initiative University when GW hosted it two years ago prompted the University to invest more to stimulate these types of ideas.
In the long run, Executive Director for the Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service Amy Cohen said she hopes to create more collaboration between similar programs the University sponsors or participates in, from the Knapp Fellowship for Entrepreneurial Service-Learning to the Public Service Grant Commission.
Graduate student Matthew Wilkins, whose bamboo bike venture won the 2012 Clinton Global Initiative University competition, said he is “thrilled” about GW’s continued commitment to social entrepreneurship and has already met with Fedri.
“Social entrepreneurship is all about empowerment,” said Wilkins, who founded Pedal Forward with two other GW students. “GW Upstart does just that for our students, providing them with the resources to tackle today’s most pressing global issues.”

A company contracted to clean GW residence halls for the past three years is battling former employees who claim they were not paid after weeks of doing work in Thurston Hall, Potomac Hall and Ivory Tower this summer.
Eleven workers claim  BRAVO! Building Services fired them and then withheld more than $13,000 in wages after they cleaned residence hall rooms for about three weeks this May.
The company agreed to pay the workers their wages in July, but six employees refused to accept the payments because they didn’t include damages they are owed under D.C. law. Companies in D.C. must pay damages when wages are more than 10 days late.
All of the workers continue to fight for damages and claim the company owes them nearly $20,000 in unpaid wages and damages.
The former BRAVO! Building Services employees said their supervisor encouraged them to work as many hours as they wanted, each clocking in about 70 hours a week on average. But after the two-week pay period passed without a check, workers were told they were no longer needed and could not collect their wages from their supervisor.
Karen Martinez, president and CEO of BRAVO! Building Services, said in an email last week that the company plans to organize a public forum to hear from the workers. She said her company made “all efforts” to pay the workers based on the number of hours they claimed, which were “significantly higher than what our records show.”
Martinez called the workers’ protests a “ploy to make us look like we are a bad employer.”
Julia Hidalgo, a 29-year-old living in Silver Spring, Md., said the company’s staffer refused to pay her wages when she went to her supervisor’s office in Thurston Hall. Hidalgo added that the company’s Arlington office told her they had no records of their work.
She said she will continue to fight for her $2,424 in wages and damages, even if that means going to court.
“For me, it was hard, because I have to be paying for someone to take care of my daughter while I have to go [ask for my checks], not expecting anything, returning empty-handed,” Hidalgo said.
As workers’ back-and-forth with the company continued, daily expenses and rent due dates forced several former employees to turn to loans.
Juan Ambrocio, 44, said he took out a high-interest loan to cover unavoidable expenses like his rent and food. He said he’s had to find additional work to begin paying back the loans.
Still, he rejected the company’s late July offer to pay him wages without damages and continues to demand his $1,831 salary and the same amount in damages. He was already in debt when the company offered to pay workers just their wages and said the damage has already been done.
The workers are getting help from GW’s Progressive Student Union and a labor rights group called the D.C. Employment Justice Center, which is helping the workers pressure the facilities company and the University.
“This is happening on our campus, in our dorms, so every student should have a stake in this and be concerned,” senior Yasemin Ayarci said.
Members of the Progressive Student Union met with Senior Associate Vice President for Operations Alicia Knight last week to ask GW to investigate the issue. Senior Sam Nelson, a leader of the group, said Knight told the students that she would inform the University’s Office of General Counsel.
University spokesman Dave Andrews, who responded on behalf of Knight, said GW is aware of the dispute and “is committed to fair labor practices.” He has asked the company for more information.
Andrews said the University will “take appropriate action” if it finds any wrongdoing by the contracted company. He declined to say whether GW will continue to work with BRAVO! Building Services – which was hired by a University services contractor, Aramark.
Nicholas Woodfield, one of the chief lawyers at the Employment Law Group law firm, said an employer can only avoid paying damages if it can demonstrate that it had a valid reason for failing to pay employee salaries.
“It’s very hard to successfully assert a claim that you somehow, in good faith, didn’t pay them any money when they’re showing up everyday and working for you,” Woodfield said.
