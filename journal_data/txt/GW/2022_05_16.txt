Metro general manager and chief executive officer Paul Wiedefeld announced he would be retiring effective immediately Monday after the Metro announced delays due to a failure to recertify train operators.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Sunday that Yellow and Green Line trains will be running on a delayed schedule because “nearly half” of its rail operators were not up to date with their certifications. Wiedefeld, who announced in January that he would be retiring later this summer, said in his statement that he is retiring now to make interim General Manager Andy Off’s transition into the position smoother.
“I believe conveying all authority of the General Manager’s office to Mr. Off better positions him to address the challenges that came to light this week, while preparing for the transition to the next CEO,” Wiedefeld said.
WMATA’s Board of Directors selected Randy Clarke to be the Metro’s next permanent general manager and CEO earlier this month, according to a release.
The new delays come after the Metro’s 7000-series trains were pulled from the tracks in October after a Blue Line derailment. 7000-series railcars still haven’t returned to service, causing severe service delays.
Joe Leader, Metro’s chief operating officer, also resigned effective Monday. Wiedefeld thanked Leader for “his tireless work and dedication” to the position in his statement.
“Stepping aside a few weeks ahead of schedule is in the best interest of the agency and its workforce, whom I have been deeply proud to lead over the last six years,” Wiedefeld said.

Doing laundry is a necessity, but with a failing payment system, the process is much more complicated than it needs to be at GW. Students’ tuition includes 34 prepaid loads of laundry, or 17 free washer-dryer cycles, before students must pay with Colonial Cash or dining dollars to clean their clothes. But when students go to pay for a fresh load, they’ll often find broken GWorld card readers that leave them digging for quarters as the only possible form of payment left. Card reader malfunctions only add to the larger issue of machine disrepair in laundry facilities and force GW to spend time and resources on fixing unnecessary technological problems. Officials need to realize that the readers’ repeated service outages warrant a permanent solution. It is time that the University eliminates card readers to dedicate more time to fixing broken machines in laundry facilities, and in doing so, make laundry free.
Students deserve better-maintained laundry facilities even though hauling dirty clothes to residence hall laundry rooms only to see broken machines, flooded floors or wet clothes has nearly become a right of passage for students. Granting students unlimited loads would keep GW from spending so much time fixing malfunctioning card readers and offer students more opportunities to clean their clothes. Technological issues with card readers often warrant the removal of software and hardware with newly ordered replacements on top of multiple days of repair. While the card readers are down, students have to pay for laundry out of pocket, despite the free loads they are given. Eliminating the card readers altogether would not only ensure that all students can do their laundry for free but also redirect the attention spent on card reader repair to fixing the laundry machines that fail to properly function.
At least five times during the past academic year, the single laundry card reader in my residence hall was completely unresponsive due to a technological issue. Even after fellow students and I would fill out several FixIt forms to replace the card reader, it would remain broken for days and sometimes up to a week. One time, the card reader was left broken for more than 10 days because a new hardware piece needed replacement. The lack of a functioning card reader leaves students in the inconvenient position of paying with quarters, even if they still have free loads to use. Local restaurants and stores could only offer me about $5 in quarters due to a coin shortage in April, and I spent hours going door to door, both in residence halls and restaurants, finding those coins on campus. Washing and drying a load of laundry costs $3.50 or $1.75 per cycle. Students must often wash or dry clothes multiple times per load when the laundry machines fail to work properly, which only raises that price. Ultimately, I resorted to walking several blocks to another residence hall to do my laundry.
The laundry machines of my residence hall also flooded the basement twice this academic year. The dirty water ruined students’ clothes in the machines, made the building smell awful and the only option to get clothes in the laundry room was to wade through the water until it was drained after several days. It is understandable that laundry machines will not work 100 percent of the time, but the University should prioritize and improve its response time to laundry-related issues. Leaving machines broken or allowing water to sit in the basement of a residence hall for several days is not safe and students deserve better.
Complications with the card reader and poor machine maintenance can backlog laundry rooms with students waiting to clean their clothes. Once a maintenance issue is resolved, all the machines are consistently full of loads that students have waited to run, leaving many others without a place to do laundry for even longer. Some are willing to pull other students’ clothes out of machines after their time is up. Those who are not quick enough to remove their own belongings from machines can find them in a pile on the floor after their load is done. This laundry room backup proved very inconvenient for me when I decided to remove my wet clothes from the dryer for another student to use instead of running them through a second cycle. Students also have a personal responsibility to better track their laundry. The University provides students with a GW Laundry Tracker that notifies them when cycles are complete and allows them to reserve machines. Making use of this feature would help simplify the laundry process at GW.
Finally, GW should address where the revenue from laundry credit goes. While students pay nearly $80,000 annually, they deserve to know how the University spends the charge of $1.75 per load. If the money students spend on laundry is meant to enhance laundry facilities, the University most definitely is not succeeding. Seeing as it does not provide basic services like drying clothes on a constant basis, GW needs to better ensure the effectiveness of laundry facilities and communicate where students’ laundry money is used.
The solution to poorly managed laundry facilities is to do away with the payment system that GW currently has installed in each laundry room so that there is more time to focus on the conditions of the washing and drying machines. It is in students’ and GW’s best interest to reevaluate the laundry system – receiving unlimited laundry loads instead of tapping a card reader would eliminate another opportunity for malfunctions and allow GW to better address rampant facility issues. Students deserve to have properly functioning laundry machines instead of running around looking for quarters or finding other buildings to do their laundry.

President Joe Biden’s repeated debt repayment freezes and more recent willingness to attempt debt forgiveness for some have left student borrowers confused about their own financial future. Indebted students have to decide whether they’ll hold out for wholesale debt forgiveness or make the most of Biden’s payment pause – and what to do if or when those payments restart. As more students rely on this increasingly complex system of government, private and institutional financial aid to meet GW’s rising cost of attendance, the University can and should educate student borrowers about student loans by way of online courses and public forums to ensure current and prospective students understand the true cost of student loans.
Government-backed loans can make college more accessible, especially for first generation, minority and low-income students who might otherwise lack the financial resources to attend college. Yet such loans can mire students into debt. The average student loan debt balance can total nearly $40,000, and the average GW student graduated with $33,305 in debt in 2018. Federal action meant to address student debt might only make their individual situations more complicated – who can expect what relief and when? Forgiving or freezing student loan debt can relieve student borrowers’ financial burden, but it doesn’t make the student loan process any easier to understand. Borrowers who don’t know the basics of the student loan process need help that goes beyond relief – they need information about student loans in general.
Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona have already made some progress in addressing the $1.7 trillion issue of student loan debt facing more than 40 million student borrowers. Addressing student loans was part of Biden’s presidential campaign, and he has forgiven the debts of borrowers with disabilities and those who attended fraudulent for-profit colleges since his election. While the measures have been fairly narrowly tailored to certain groups of borrowers, Biden has also supported more widespread solutions to student debt. He extended a repayment freeze that his predecessor began in March 2020 six times as of April, which has saved nearly 37 million borrowers roughly $195 billion in waived payments. But unlike forgiveness, this freeze still leaves students with the same levels of debt.

Rather than continuous repayment pauses, progressives have favored sweeping loan forgiveness. Calls for unilaterally canceling all student loan debt via executive order went mainstream during the 2020 election after Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., released proposals to cancel up to $50,000 of debt and all student debt, respectively. Moderates and conservatives who favor any form of student debt relief argue that students’ income or their amount of debt should determine potential debt forgiveness. This stricter or “means-tested” approach ultimately caps relief for those above a certain income level. Between this ideological impasse and questions about whether Biden has the legal authority to unilaterally cancel student debt via executive order, government action that goes beyond repayment freezes to address student debt seems unlikely. It’s still worth pushing for some form of relief, but it likely won’t be enough to relieve students of their debt.
The trillion-dollar problem of student debt stems from students’ lack of knowledge as much as it does predatory loan companies or out-of-control tuition costs. Teenage first-time borrowers may be making a major financial commitment without understanding how serious their decision is – the costs and benefits of student loans aren’t for everyone. But combined with the societal pressure to attend college, especially at prestigious universities like GW, and the normalization of student debt, taking out student loans is almost a right of passage if not a financial necessity for many students.
That’s not to say that students aren’t taking their loans seriously, but rather that student loans are extremely complicated. In turn, students need help to understand them. GW’s estimated cost of attendance next year is more than $80,000 for most undergraduates, and a likely corresponding rise in students’ financial aid needs means that the University should explain the terms and conditions of that aid.
Like in 2020, the University should conduct a series of virtual and in-person town halls to address students’ and their families’ questions and concerns about changes to financial aid. Beyond these question-and-answer sessions, a streamlined crash course on the basics of student loans would help student borrowers make an informed decision about whether taking out student loans is right for them. The Office of Student Financial Assistance already provides an overview of the financial aid process, and students can visit the Student Services Hub in the University Student Center for assistance and answers to their questions, including those about student loans. But these resources aren’t helpful if students aren’t aware of them or when the information they provide is no longer relevant in the face of shifting federal policies. Beyond GW, students looking for more information can visit the Federal Student Aid website directly to learn the basics about the federal student loan process.
With changes to federal student loan policies on the horizon, the University should equip students with the tools to educate themselves about their individual student loans. If such loans can make education accessible, then direct, effective and consistent communication about them can help first-time borrowers avoid the trillion-dollar problem of student debt. With GW’s support, its students can confidently navigate the pros and cons of such a life-changing financial decision.

The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified substance use across the country, especially among incoming college students. Research has found that nearly one in five students in grades eight, 10 and 12 used illicit drugs at least once in 2021, and nearly one in four 18- to 24-year-olds used alcohol or drugs to cope with the pandemic. College students’ drug-related deaths make clear that universities can intervene before it’s too late to support these incoming classes who have grappled with addiction, especially as synthetic opioids like fentanyl make drug use even more dangerous.
But the University has so far failed to rise to the occasion, limiting its alcohol and drug programming to online modules that fail to connect students to a shortage of resources. With a new wave of freshmen arriving on campus this fall while drug abuse and addiction persist in the United States, now is the time for GW to improve its prevention programs and recovery resources to address the challenges incoming students will face.
While GW’s current prevention plan adequately teaches new students about the dangers of drinking and general drug use, the University fails to provide readily available and updated resources that reflect the pandemic’s marked effects on mental health and the country’s struggle to contain fentanyl. After a Stanford student overdosed on fentanyl in January 2020, the university expanded its addiction recovery program and offered greater substance-use education. GW should follow this example and implement an entirely in-person program that centralizes its prevention and recovery resources to address substance abuse and addiction on campus.
GW requires all incoming first- and second-year residential students, including transfer students, to take AlcoholEdu as part of its alcohol and drug substance-use intervention policies, offering situational prevention methods that provide students with social tools to avoid consuming drugs and alcohol. But AlcoholEdu’s asynchronous program designed for mass and annual usage requires little to no focus or attention for most students to complete. Barely a year after its creation, officials cut GW’s Pathways to Recovery program after it failed to gain the interest of even a single student. The program was set to aid students facing high-level sanctions from the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities with self-designed rehabilitation plans for each participant, matching them with a mentor from a pool of faculty, staff, alumni and community members to guide their progress.
The Collegiate Recovery Community, a recovery-focused student organization that the University rebranded in 2018 with administrative leadership in place of the failed Pathways program, relies on group-based recovery therapy methods like social events and professional development opportunities. While CRC is a step in the right direction, it does not provide the extensively personalized treatment that Pathways to Recovery promised. Its broad events for general audiences fall short of the intensive treatment that Pathways to Recovery would have offered and which could address the pandemic’s impact on students’ mental health.
Resources for students suffering from substance abuse disorders at GW remain scattered, limited and primarily online. Students would benefit from a singular prevention and recovery program on campus that meshes Pathways to Recovery’s intensive treatment for at-risk students with the CRC’s accessibility and detachment from the disciplinary process. Prioritizing community outreach and student engagement would clarify that the newly-proposed program would remain separate from SRR’s disciplinary system. The CRC’s popularity on campus compared to that of Pathways to Recovery demonstrates that students are much more likely to join a group that advertises itself as a greater community than a “get out of jail free card.”
GW can look to Kennesaw State University’s Center for Young Adult Addiction and Recovery for a program to model its revitalized approach to substance abuse. Kennesaw staff offer all students harm-reduction exercises like tolerance break training, which aims to safely break down a student’s drug dependence, and lessons on the administration of naloxone, which rapidly reverses an opioid overdose. Students can easily access these resources in addition to the university’s own Collegiate Recovery Community on the center’s website. Like Kennesaw, GW should form a robust pool of resources that would reflect the diversity of students’ needs to encourage participation in and reduce stigmas surrounding University-sponsored programs.
GW should invite its CARE Team to partner with the GW Hospital and the Milken Institute School of Public Health to produce meaningful research that will inform prevention and rehabilitation methods on campus. An interprofessional team of researchers from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences announced in November “Project RESULT,” an effort to train clinicians to recognize and treat substance-use disorders. To specifically focus on the needs of its students, GW should go one step further and become involved in recovery science research, a unique field that focuses on how people can recover from substance abuse.
Making naloxone available in every University building and training students and faculty to use it would also mitigate the potential for lethal overdoses on campus. D.C. residents can receive a naloxone kit for free from the Opioid Learning Institute, an educational initiative that aims to share smart opioid prescribing practices with health care professionals in the city. University-sponsored naloxone training would make every member of the University community more capable of saving lives at a very small cost.
GW should recognize the educational limitations of its mostly online modules and focus more on connecting students to its more intensive resources instead of checking off its prevention and recovery resources requirement for students. GW has the resources for such a program to exist and flourish – it just needs to organize them.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., was admitted to GW Hospital over the weekend, but he said he expects to return to work this week.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., is being treated at GW Hospital after suffering a “minor stroke” over the weekend, according to a statement released Sunday evening.
Van Hollen said he was admitted to GW Hospital after experiencing “lightheadedness and acute neck pain” while delivering a speech at a Western Maryland Democratic Party Summit. He said doctors told him that he shouldn’t experience long-term effects from the incident, but that he should be kept under observation at the hospital for the time being.
He said he planned to return to work later this week, but his staff would curtail his schedule for the next few days.
“Fortunately, I have been informed that there are no long-term effects or damage as a result of this incident, but my doctors have advised that out of an abundance of caution I remain under observation for a few days,” he said in the statement.
Van Hollen said he received an angiogram and physicians found a small venous tear in the back of his head. He is currently running for reelection and is expected to defeat business owner Michelle Smith in July’s Democratic primary due to his high approval rating among Democrats.
“I look forward to returning to work in the Senate later this week and thank the medical team for their excellent care,” he said.
Van Hollen’s hospitalization comes on the same day as Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, currently the frontrunner in the Democratic primary to replace retiring Republican Sen. Patrick Toomey, also announced he had suffered a stroke earlier in the weekend. He said doctors found a clot in his heart, which had caused both a stroke and cardiovascular issues.
“The amazing doctors here were able to quickly and completely remove the clot, reversing the stroke, they got my heart under control as well,” Fetterman said in a statement released Sunday. “It’s a good reminder to listen to your body and be aware of the signs.”
Democrats control the tiebreaking vote in an even 50-50 partisan split in the Senate, meaning Van Hollen’s temporary absence from the chamber puts the party’s majority at risk as lawmakers propose legislation on topics ranging from abortion rights to military aid for Ukraine.
Van Hollen, 63, has represented Maryland in the Senate since 2017, after serving seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives for the state’s 8th congressional district.

Former Student Bar Association President Jordan Michel said through students' shared experiences in law school, the class learned humility, acceptance and inclusivity.
GW Law honored its graduating class of 2022 in the Smith Center Sunday.
Officials congratulated the graduating seniors, among the 3,000-person crowd, for their accomplishments during their time at law school. U.S. Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., a GW Law alumni and the keynote speaker, talked about her difficult experiences in her early law career as a woman and how happy she was to see a diverse graduating class.
“By that point, you can say that I felt less than confident in my career choice, especially given the fact that at that time, I was one of very few women in the profession, and I looked far younger than my 25 years,” Wild said. “Often, I was mistaken for the court reporter or a secretary, and let me say as I look out on this crowd today, at the diversity of faces in this audience, I feel such a sense of pride. We have come a long way in this profession.”
Wild said students should take a different view of what resilience means to them and try and push themselves through difficult tasks like challenging court cases, but should give themselves a break if they are struggling with issues like mental health crises.
“So as I leave you today, my fervent hope is this, that you are resilient,” Wild said. “But more importantly that you understand what resilience means. Be bold, be kind, be open minded and thoughtful. And most importantly, do not be afraid.”
Michael Abramowicz, the Jeffrey and Martha Kohn senior associate dean for academic affairs and a professor of law, said law school Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew tested positive for COVID-19 so she was unable to attend the event, but Abramowicz congratulated the class for their resilience in his speech.
“This is a very special day for our law school as we gather to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of our class of 2022 Juris Doctor, Master of Laws, Master of Studies in Law and Doctor of Juridical Science recipients,” Abramowicz said. “Your class has overcome many obstacles and demonstrated extraordinary resilience to reach this day, and I congratulate you all.”
Provost and law professor Chris Bracey, who previously served as the interim dean of the law school from 2019 to 2020, said the graduating class should take pride in their new degrees due to struggles like the COVID-19 pandemic they faced on their way to graduation.
“Graduates, you are here today because you excelled with distinction in your studies through a very difficult period in modern history,” Bracey said. “There is no shame in taking pride in what you have accomplished through all of your hard work. Indeed, I insist that you take pride in all that you were able to accomplish during your three years at the George Washington University Law School.”
Outgoing Student Bar Association president Jordan Michel and member of the law school Class of 2022, said he is thankful for the family members, friends and classmates, for their support throughout his law school experience.
“We appreciate you, we wouldn’t be here without you,” Michel said. “Thank you for putting up with us at our worst selves for the last three, four years. We’ve definitely needed the support of each other, as well as some of our family members, so thank you all.”
Michel said through their shared experiences in law school the class learned humility, acceptance and inclusivity.
“Whether it was in student organizations or on journals, in your communities, or on school initiatives, the Class of 2022 is full of countless impressive leaders,” Michel said.

Alyssa Ayres, the dean of the Elliott School, said she was "inspired" by the resilience of the Class of 2022 as students endured the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Elliott School of International Affairs celebrated the graduating Class of 2022 at its first in-person graduation ceremony since 2019 in the Smith Center Friday.
Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-NY, the keynote speaker at the event, called on graduates to “give back” to their communities using their degrees from the Elliott School as they enter the field of public service. Saad Al-Tami, the student speaker at the ceremony and a candidate for a Master of Arts in International Affairs, said he watched his classmates and professors become friends and mentors throughout his time at GW, and he is now graduating from the Elliott School with a new family.
Meeks said the “optimism and determination” of the Class of 2022 has boosted his own optimism about the United States’ ability to confront major issues like climate change.
“Our government runs on the passions, the visions and the optimism of young people like you,” he said at the ceremony.
Meeks said his parents, who paid his tuition for his law degree at Howard University despite struggling financially, asked him to “pay it forward” when he graduated. He urged the Class of 2022 to do the same.
“Now I’m calling on you, the Class of 2022, to do your jobs, to go out and lead and be the change you wish to see,” Meeks said. “And I say as my mother told me, never forget who you are. Never forget where you came from. Never forget your parents and others who helped you accomplish your goals.”
Al-Tami said graduates have a responsibility to take what they learned during their time at the Elliott School and join the fight for a better future.
“We are the future,” he said. “We are two blocks away from the White House, just across the street from the State Department, just next to the IMF and the World Bank. And we are also a moment away from the change that we wish to see.”
Alyssa Ayres, the dean of the Elliott School, said she was “inspired” by the Class of 2022’s resilience as they endured the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Members of our graduating class gathered here today are not only prepared to tackle the world’s toughest problems, they are eager to take on the challenge,” she said.

Interim University President Mark Wrighton said he’s “delighted” about the impact that SMHS faculty made on the class that is the first to graduate in GW’s third century as a University. 
Faculty of the School of Medicine and Health Sciences led the graduation celebration for the class of 2022 Saturday afternoon.
Professors from SMHS distributed four awards to graduate and undergraduate students in the class at the ceremony. Officials offered advice and wisdom to the departing class and expressed their pride for the students’ hard work despite enduring challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic.
Barbara Bass, the dean of SMHS, said the school acknowledges the hard work of the class, especially during the past two years of the pandemic when students played key roles in administering vaccines and tests or performing laboratory research.
She said the knowledge the class gained at GW will lead the class to serve people in a “beautifully personal” way to restore health and prevent illness.
“We will take great pride in your achievements and contributions to the communities you will serve that will utilize those knowledge and skills that you gain here at GW,” Bass said.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton said despite only being at GW for four months he’s “delighted” about the impact the faculty made on the class that is the first to graduate in GW’s third century as a University.
He said he encourages each student to be a “lifelong learner” to keep up with changing times and how important the students’ work is to supporting their faculty and colleagues.
“As you know, well, the world is changing rapidly and the demands of today’s economy reflect that breakneck speed,” Wrighton said. “In turn, our graduates must be skilled in new ways.”
Karen Schlumpf, a professor of clinical research and leadership, said honoring the two recipients of the Ozgur Ekmekci Interprofessional Leadership Award, Yvonne Rodriguez and Edith Teng, was a “pleasure” as they both have shown their commitment to promoting collaboration and scholarship in the health sciences world.
“These recipients emulate qualities that Ozgur lived and that we admire in his work with students and colleagues,” Schlumpf said.
Alexandra Davis, the recipient of the outstanding undergraduate student award and graduating with a bachelors of science, said her time in the U.S. Navy showed her the challenges that come along with a career in health care but working in a lab drove her purpose in the field.
“Whether or not you stay in health sciences, your passion will continue to drive your decisions down new paths,” Davis said.
Clifford Cymrot, an assistant professor of biomedical laboratory sciences, said Davis’ dedication and persistence over the course of completing her degree and has a “heart” for her peers, profession and community.
“One of the missions of the School of Medicine and Health Sciences is to develop tomorrow’s leaders,” Cymrot said.
Wencesley Paez, the recipient of the outstanding graduate student award and a masters of science in health sciences in clinical and translational research graduate, said the challenges he encountered in his studies has taught him how to adapt to changing circumstances.
“Productivity in everything you do, make it count be productive citizens in this society, whether it be at home or at work,” Paez said.
Samar Nasser, an associate professor of clinical research and leadership, said Paez’s clinical background and years of clinical research experience were an “asset” to the clinical research and leadership program that aided in challenging and bettering his classmates through class discussions.
“I’m truly blessed, honored and humbled to be here today to provide this Outstanding Graduate Student Award to Dr. Paez in front of his friends and families and our colleagues,” Nasser said.
Reamer Bushardt, the senior associate dean for health and sciences and professor of physician assistant studies, said treating teamwork as a healthcare superpower and facing setbacks as opportunities allows for progress and prepares the students for obstacles in the future.
“I challenge you to lead through your character and with integrity.” Bushardt said, “You will make the world a better place, a juster place as if you take your next steps.”
