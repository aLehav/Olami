The dean of the GW School of Business and six graduate students will help steer D.C.’s economic future, looking to create jobs and spur city development, Mayor Vincent Gray announced June 6.
Gray called on area business schools to recommend the best mix of tax breaks and investments to help D.C. grow as part of its five-year economic strategy. Business school Dean Doug Guthrie will co-chair the strategy advisory group alongside David Thomas, dean of Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business, which started preliminary research in April but did the bulk of the planning in early June.
The strategy group, separated into seven sectors including real estate and construction, will help the city decide how to allocate tax dollars to lure businesses to the area and build up industries, aiming to create the first economic strategy plan to take effect since Gray took office in 2010.
Leaders of business, politics and higher education, will help GW “walk the walk,” Guthrie said, in its marketing pitch to intersect business with society. The city is running a $172 million budget deficit, heightening the urgency for an economic plan to make sound recommendations for where to put resources.
“We need to have an institution that serves a community and thinks deeply about its ties to the community and how it’s connected to the rest of the world,” Guthrie said. “If we preach about the intersection with business and society, we should be doing that, as well, as an institution.”
The group will call on 16 area students – six from GW, five from Georgetown University, three from American University and two from Howard University – to interview local business leaders and conduct research to create an economic impact model for the city, using interviews and quantitative analysis to recommend future public investments.
Guthrie added that by aligning with business schools, the city will save money in mapping out its economic future in its $400,000 plan, which includes research and labor costs. City officials have said it would cost $2 million to use a private consulting firm.
Gray, an alumnus, has made it a point over the last two years to reach out to area universities to aid in the city’s economic and environmental goals.
“Together, they will help us survey our industry sector leaders and identify opportunities for the public sector and private sector, working in tandem to catalyze economic development and generate jobs,” Gray said June 6.
The team will also work alongside Victor Hoskins, Gray’s deputy mayor for planning and economic development, with whom Guthrie has also forged strong ties.
Hoskins has teamed up with GW in international projects, joining Guthrie and University President Steven Knapp in China last spring when GW established a partnership with the Suzhou Industrial Park.
Overseeing the city’s economic development adds to Guthrie’s hefty workload as business school dean. The school is knee-deep in its strategy to earn degree-granting status in China, launching an online MBA program this fall, outlining a strategic plan and undergoing an undergraduate curriculum overhaul.
“It’s a little bit of an extra burden, and it’s busy, but the ways in which it actually relates to our general mission and how it can be used for not just service for the city but as a strategic perspective, as a branding opportunity, it’s worth it,” Guthrie said.

The University will begin recruiting parents to take more proactive roles in career fairs and networking events this year as part of an effort to expand job opportunities for students.
As part of a three-year overhaul to improve the job-search experience for students, the Parents’ Association and Career Center will team up this Colonial Inauguration to push successful parents to connect with students looking to enter their field at career fairs and networking events – roles traditionally filled by alumni, Robert Snyder, executive director of University initiatives, said.
As the University hit a landmark 250,000 living alumni last May, he said GW will continue to draw on this expanding pool of graduates for networking opportunities.
“This is a way for parents to get involved in a very positive way,” Rodney Johnson, executive director of the Office of Parent Services, said. “It’s not about tracking parents; it’s about helping them to help their students.”
Parents’ Association Advisory Council President Carmine Gibaldi said the effort demonstrates a further commitment to finding students meaningful career experiences.
On the first day of CI, parents will hear about how to get involved and be able to sign up for the Parents’ Association listserv.
The Career Center plans to group parents and alumni into six broad industry groups, designed to complement academic majors and segment parents by their student’s class.
Working with Snyder to oversee the revamp of the Career Center, Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski has underscored the need for the University to synchronize career advising between schools and provide more specialized career planning for undergraduates.
“We are thinking about the ways we will connect with parents in the future,” Konwerski said.
GW started a search for an assistant provost for University career services in June. The new administrator’s pay is included in the $568,000 funding increase received from the Board of Trustees in May to develop professional partnerships and specialize undergraduate career advising.
Snyder, who has helped steer the Career Services Task Force since 2010, said research found greater emphasis on parent involvement in career services at schools similar to GW.
The 25-member career services task force, founded in fall 2010 at the request of University President Steven Knapp, helped create the new career services model that will roll out in the next three years.

Chris Anderson was at the perfect vantage point to witness the unfolding force of the Internet in 2001.
Being editor in chief of Wired magazine taught him the Web would not be a short-lived fad, and Anderson said it was then that he figured out it was a sound move to drop physics at the end of his GW career to instead focus on writing.
“I was lucky enough to be at the core of this emerging information network. I just didn’t realize how big it was,” he said.
Anderson enrolled at the University at the age of 25, after failing out of the University of Maryland and moving into a group home in downtown D.C. – the start of his unusual GW career.
He did not join student organizations or even try to make friends on campus, enrolling in only night classes while working as a court messenger for a law firm during the day.
“It was a pretty monastic experience for me,” Anderson said.
A few years after he graduated in 1981, he realized following a track in physics would lead him to become a “cog in a machine,” most likely working as a lab technician doing research for a large company.
He spent time at Science and Nature, two leading scientific journals, before landing a position at The Economist, which gave him the chance to travel to London and China to write about science and technology.
During this time, he read Wired, which at that time was just beginning to cover the Internet.
Anderson said the magazine’s early coverage was what made him realize how the world was at a tipping point in terms of technological advancement, and that the Web would serve as the necessary catalyst.
He jumped at the chance when offered the magazine’s highest position.
“[Wired] changed my life. I felt that this was the biggest story of our time and this was the best way to cover it,” Anderson said.
Looking back, with three National Magazine Awards under his belt, Anderson said he first thought he was a “longshot” for the job position, lacking managerial or design experience.
But what got him the job was his passion for technology reporting, a trait he said was invaluable for students to begin fostering in college.
“You have only one job in college, and your job is to figure out what you love,” he said, “Not what you could be employed to do, not what your parents want you to do, but your job is to find out who you are and your passion.”

Correction appended
After working for two failed presidential bids, Adam Conner was done with campaigning and ready to break into the business world.
But politics followed Conner, and just months later, he introduced the District to Facebook.
Starting up the social media network’s outreach efforts in the capital after graduating in 2007, Conner worked largely out of his living room as the office’s sole employee for two years.
The now multibillion dollar company’s D.C. office has since moved to a sleek building downtown at 1158 F St. NW. and employs about a dozen people.
Conner, the branch’s manager of public policy for the office’s politics and government, said his path to Facebook was paved by the two flopped campaign flops, working full-time for Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner.
A semester off to work the Kerry campaign full-time in 2004, during his junior year, cemented his political passion, spurring him to continue traveling on campaign trails.
Conner also signed up for political science courses at GW, where he said he honed his understanding of the political system he had spent so much time navigating.
“I remember loving going from the campaign war room to the classroom and discussing what was happening in the election in real-time,” Conner said.
So the Pi Kappa Alpha member and leader of the progressive Roosevelt Institute, turned down GW’s coveted Presidential Administrative Fellowship for a position on Warner’s presidential exploratory committee.
“That 2008 campaign ended up ending before we even got to 2007,” Conner, who was also a Hatchet columnnist, said. “And though I didn’t know it at the time, [it] helped me eventually end up at Facebook.”
He keeps his passion for politics alive through Facebook, regularly working with members of Congress and government agencies across the District to convince public officials to create accounts and training them on strategic use and avoid tripping themselves up by violating campaign, privacy and finance laws.
Conner also serves as Facebook’s liaison to President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign, offering advice on how to best take advantage of resources on Facebook, beyond garnering “likes.”
“I came to GW interested in politics, but I developed my love for it at GW,” Conner said. “There are very few places where you can immerse yourself in something like you can in D.C.”
This article was updated June 29, 2012 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet reported that Adam Conner offers Barack Obama’s campaign reelection advice and that Facebook’s D.C. headquarters is located in Dupont. In fact, Conner provides the campaign advice on Facebook resources, and the D.C. office is located downtown at 1158 F St. NW. The Hatchet also reported that Conner was a chief lobbyist for the company. Conner has registered as a lobbyist in recent years but is not a 2012 registered lobbyist. He began as the first D.C.-based employee and now formally holds the title of manager of public policy for the office’s politics and government team.

In the nation’s capital, there are hundreds of government agencies, think tanks, nonprofits and companies that hire interns or employees during the school year. These positions will not just fall into your lap, but most are not very difficult to find. Use the GW Career Center’s GWork database, where you can upload a resume and apply for jobs in just minutes. The center also offers resume trips and reviews, along with general advice for internship and job-hunting. You should also befriend your professors, as they are likely connected in their fields in the District and can put in a good word for you.
Upperclassmen may warn that fast fingers are the only way to score a dream schedule as a freshman, but do not worry. Students are allowed to add and drop classes after everyone registers, and there will be lots of class-swapping, opening up spaces for you to get classes you could not snag a spot in the first time around. Some classes have waiting lists and you could receive an email when a seat opens up. At other times, professors will squeeze you into a class if they know you are passionate. But fast fingers on the registration portal do help, so have your course registration numbers ready to copy and paste into the form. But remember, that it is just your first semester, and you have plenty of time to get into those classes.
Moving away from your family can be difficult, but striking a balance between different college commitments  you will encounter will ease the adjustment. Do not go home more often than you need to. To actually adjust to college life you need to be here. Even if you live near home, save visits for breaks – not weekends. Keep busy with student organizations and club sports, Greek life and internships. Remember that the University Counseling Center offers six free sessions if you are feeling homesick or depressed, or struggling academically.
About 25 percent of students are involved in Greek life, and GW offers chapters with cultural, professional and philanthropic focuses in addition to more than a dozen social sororities and fraternities. Members of the Greek community find networking opportunities and a tight-knit community. Recruitment takes place in both the fall and spring.
You don’t need to declare your major until second semester of sophomore year, but some students may want to declare majors early. To declare a major, fill out a declaration form and get signatures from your academic adviser and your school or program. For your first year, you are required to meet an adviser to create a plan to fulfill all your academic requirements. Give yourself time to sample classes from different disciplines and get general requirements out of the way before declaring a major. Try to stay flexible and open-minded, as many students end up changing their minds about their fields of study.
Although having to switch housing is not ideal, it happens. If your living situation does not work out, you are not alone. Living in a college residence hall is a huge adjustment, and it’s understandable if you and your roommate aren’t best friends. If your housing situation is interfering with your quality of life at GW, find someone to switch rooms with through the GW Housing Programs room swap portal. Head to living.gwu.edu and use the online system to reach out to other students who looking for an out. Once you agree on a swap, you can change rooms immediately.
For students who played varsity sports in high school but are not interested in the full-time commitment that comes with a Division I team, there are club sports. Joining a team will help you meet people, stay in shape and maintain your competitive edge while keeping some of your free time to yourself. Check out teams at student organization fairs and talk to club leaders about practice and travel logistics since some teams compete locally and regionally. Regardless of the level of competition, most club sports teams become very close and hold social events often. Plus, athletes get access to better sports facilities.

Dear Class of 2016,
Welcome to GW. You are about to embark on a period of self-discovery that will change your life in more ways than you think.
Allow us to introduce ourselves. As The Hatchet’s editorial board, we make sense of pressing issues and changes at the University. We are committed to sparking campus dialogue about topics that affect everyone at GW.
We meet twice a week to take a holistic and critical look at GW. You can think of us as an independent campus watchdog. But we also applaud the administration, faculty and student body when warranted.
The editorial board consists of copy editors Ryan Ermey and Amanda Kay, production manager Allison Elfring, special issues and research editor Jenna Bernick, sports editor Elizabeth Traynor, managing director Annu Subramanian, features editor Lisa Miller, contributing editor Josh Perlman, contributing opinions editor Justin Peligri and opinions editor Patrick Rochelle.
The news section is in no way tied to the opinions page, and the paper’s views – represented in staff editorials – do not indicate any judgment on part of news reporters.
You are entering college at a time when this University and higher education are at a crossroads. And as you become familiar with campus, you will notice a lot of construction. It is no secret GW is in the midst of several large projects, including the Science and Engineering Hall, the School of Public Health and Health Services and additions to the GW Law School.
But this change is not only external. There are talks about the University’s 10-year strategic plan. Among the strategic planning committee’s list of proposals is a one-college model that would likely affect the entire organization and structure of the University.
This is where you come in.
The editorial board will always be there to contribute to the conversation. But we acknowledge that we are not the only people on campus with ideas and concerns. As members of the community, it is your right and responsibility to voice your opinion.
If there is a topic you, your friends or professors are talking about, it is more likely than not something others feel strongly about. Whether it’s a letter to the editor, an op-ed or a column, we encourage you to submit your thoughts to The Hatchet.
The editorial board strives to be fair and balanced. But at times, if there is a conflict of interest, a member of the board will sit out to maintain objectivity.
A star next to a staff member’s name at the bottom of this page indicates that an individual took part in the discussion for the staff editorial.
Come fall, be as vocal as possible about campus issues. Your University will be better for it.

The summer before your first year of college is so full of hope and promise that it feels a bit like an election cycle.
You can finally bid farewell to people you didn’t like in high school and begin a fresh chapter of your life in a brand new environment. You’ve heard about how great college is and you’re ready to dive in.
But there’s probably something else on your mind right now, too: how you want to come off to a fresh group of people. This is your chance to be whoever you want among a group of people who know nothing about you.
You can reinvent yourself. And that’s a tremendous power you now have.
They never saw you in that school lunch video where you had to wear a hairnet and advertise the salad bar, and they never saw you rap on the high school quad at lunchtime because you lost a bet. This column might or might not bear resemblance to yours truly’s life.
I scoured the Internet for tips on how to best “rebrand” yourself or “turn over a new leaf” when you come to college, and most of the advice was…odd. One website instructed that if you are really committed to starting fresh, you should change your name.
I promise I won’t ask you to do that.
But the sentiment was universal: with college, with GW and with D.C. you have an incredible opportunity to be truer to yourself than you ever have been. All of a sudden, your strange hobbies don’t need to be things you do on the side. In fact, you’ll probably find a group of others right here who love it just as much as you do. If you thought high school was too homogenous, dare to be different now.
I can’t tell you how to do that. But I can tell you that you have an obligation to yourself to make sure that the person you shape yourself into in college is someone you’re proud of and comfortable with. If your town was too small, be big here. If your high school was tough on people who spoke up, shout here.
GW has a population of more than 10,000 students. If you find yourself judged, shunned or miffed, don’t edit yourself to fit in. Find new friends.
And as you start packing up for school, choose carefully what you want to take and what to leave behind. Your favorite stuffed animal you’ve had since you were born? Toss it in a suitcase. That framed photo of the ex-boyfriend you can’t seem to throw away? You don’t have space for that.
 And once you get here, be a force to reckon with. There are no limits to what you can accomplish and no boundaries but the ones you draw.
The best four years of your life are upon you. Don’t let anyone hold you back from flying by the seat of your pants.
Good luck.
Annu Subramanian, a senior majoring in journalism, is The Hatchet’s managing director and former opinions editor.

If you planned on wearing sweatpants to class, you might be in for a rude awakening.
In my first year, I have noticed that on-campus apparel is quite formal in comparison to other universities. A button down and tie or a business jacket and skirt are not uncommon sightings in GW classrooms. But that’s to be expected at a school where it is not unusual for students to simultaneously juggle classes, an internship, a leadership position on campus and volunteer work.
Of course, I’m probably preaching to the choir: many students, after all, choose GW for a front row seat to politics, culture and history as well as access to jobs and internships throughout D.C.
But the emphasis on careers and internships can be overwhelming. So here is my real advice: the only person you should ever compete with in these next four years is yourself.
Despite the obvious perks of living in the District, it’s easy for a student to sometimes feel like he is running a marathon. At times, the competition to identify lofty career goals – like becoming president – and taking concrete steps to achieve them, like getting an internship on Capitol Hill, add pressure to an already stressful four years.
There is no question the competition is stiff: you are now one of 9,500 undergraduates here. And if that is not enough, you are also competing with students at the nine other four-year universities in D.C. It’s hard not to become consumed by the ubiquitous sense of rivalry.
But my grandfather once told me there is always going to be someone who is more talented than you, and no matter how hard you work, you are never going to be perfect.
I don’t mean to discourage you. I am merely saying that when navigating the complex waters of college, be the best you can be without comparing yourself to everyone else.
If you get caught up in the whirlwind of competition, you will lose sight of the reason that you came to college in the first place: to expand your horizons.
Always remember to be patient and to recognize that sometimes, lessons learned from mistakes actually turn out to be your biggest assets. A world without accidents is a world devoid of the creativity that makes life worth living.
When you move into your residence hall in the fall, you will become a tiny part of a community perpetually in motion. But don’t get disheartened. Have your own standards. Set your own goals and work hard to achieve them. And do not give unwarranted credence to classmates who will try to push you in what they think is the right direction.
If you focus all of your energy on competing with everyone else, you will miss out as four years swiftly pass by.
So straighten that tie. Shine those shoes. Freshmen, it is time to get to work.
