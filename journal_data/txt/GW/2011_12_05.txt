The number of sexual offenses reported for the Mount Vernon Campus has increased this year, according to University crime log data.
Four sex offense cases have been reported on the Vern for 2011, according to the crime log, while annual data from the University Police Department shows one case was reported last year and none were reported in 2009.
But none of the victims filed police reports, UPD Chief Kevin Hay said, and instead reported the cases to campus security authorities like the Sexual Assault Crisis Consultation team that offers a 24-hour helpline for survivors.
Assistant Dean of Students Tara Pereira, who oversees the University’s disciplinary branches, said she attributes the climbing number of reports on the campus to increased efforts to make students aware of the issue.
She said since last summer, GW has focused on educating students, especially during Colonial Inauguration, about ways to prevent sexual assault.
“It is well established that survivors of sexual assault are often reluctant to report these incidents or seek help after they occur,” Pereira said. “So, to a large extent, we believe the number of reports we are now seeing is a direct result of these concerted efforts.”
Almost 20 percent of females in college are victims of attempted or actual sexual assaults, according to Department of Education data, and nearly 96 percent of attempted rapes go unreported.
“Certainly we have not identified any other factor that would lead to that result,” Pereira said.
The number of students living on the Vern has also risen over the years, from 400 beds in 2009 to 680 in 2010 with the opening of West Hall.
The number of liquor law violations on the campus increased from two incidents in 2009 to 10 in 2010, The Hatchet reported in November.
Hay said it is difficult to determine if there is a correlation between the increased number of liquor law violations and sexual offenses because while victims might have reported cases through alternative routes, they did not choose to file police reports with UPD.
“But it is true, the far majority of sexual assaults we investigate involve alcohol usage, and it’s usually drinking done with someone known to the victim,” he said, adding that cases at GW almost always involve a victim and an acquaintance, rather than strangers.
The Foggy Bottom Campus has faced 13 reported sex offenses for 2011, with one attempted sexual abuse and six off-campus cases reported.

As Antwan Jones looks toward his fourth semester teaching at GW, one of his first thoughts is to glance back. In reading through completed assignments and exams, the assistant sociology professor thinks about whether or not students are digesting the information he expects them to.
When he first started teaching sociology courses as a graduate student at Bowling Green State University in Kentucky, Jones got caught up with “cookie cutter” learning outcomes, or conceptual guidelines for what students should know by the end of a specific course. After he realized one of his assignments wasn’t really capturing the theory of the course, Jones modified its instructions to help students understand what he wanted them to achieve.
“If I’m not guiding students on what the paper should actually incorporate, then I can’t expect students to do what I think,” Jones said. “They shouldn’t be mind readers, and I shouldn’t assume that they are.”
As he gains more experience in his second year at GW, Jones has adapted his goals and assignments with the help of resources that are now funneled through the Teaching and Learning Collaborative, a faculty-driven effort to enhance teaching at GW that launched this fall. The group of faculty and administrators is working to expand existing programs and develop new priorities, one of which is assessment.
“It’s really about tailoring a specific need that you want your students to have filled by taking the class,” he said.
Colleges and universities nationwide are contemplating new ways to track the success of students after a Nov. 21 report by the National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment called for greater transparency in showing evidence of learning.
The study of 200 institutions of higher education pointed to their websites as untapped platforms for showcasing information about student learning. Online presentations of learning assessments have increased in recent years, but the authors of the report suggest that data be more widely available – rather than buried in internal sites – and more comprehensible to prospective students and parents.
A Campus Assessment Coordinating Council was appointed with representatives from each of GW’s 10 schools in spring 2010 to regularly review the implementation of assessment across the University.
As head of that council, Cheryl Beil, associate provost for academic planning and assessment, said GW has pushed to make both faculty and students more aware of methods that trace and advance learning since its last round of accreditation.
The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, GW’s regional accrediting agency, revised its standards to include an assessment of student learning as a key component of its accreditation review in 2002. While the body requires the assessment must take place, it lets the institution determine the steps to measure student learning, Beil said.
The University mandated that all schools identify measurable learning outcomes on course syllabi as part of GW’s accreditation review in 2006 to 2007. All programs must identify four to five central learning outcomes and choose at least two measures for each one that will provide evidence of learning, including one “direct” measure like a product or performance.
Faculty can receive assistance in writing and planning measurements for learning outcomes through the Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning. As a member of a junior faculty community last semester, Jones also gained insight and support from more senior faculty members. The learning community, which will mark its third year this spring, aims to bring in more participants to the program through efforts of the Teaching and Learning Collaborative.
Building course syllabi around the notion of student learning required a shift in thinking away from the assumption that faculty should be “knowledge holders,” Jones said. The junior faculty learning community, he said, emphasized ways to keep students engaged and to make learning fun and accessible.
“So we’re not the harborers of information,” he said. “We’re the facilitators of dialogue.”
As a way to centralize learning outcome information, Beil’s office created a single website to collect tips and examples for measuring how well faculty’s courses work.
Each year, academic departments or programs produce reports showing student achievements toward at least one to two learning outcomes and all outcomes must be evaluated every five years. The reports must also outline future steps for educational growth.
These annual reports are sent to the deans of each college and to the Office of Academic Planning and Assessment for review. Findings from learning outcome assessments can be used for curricula reform or for making decisions about raises, promotions and tenure.
“The assessment results are used as guidance, not to dictate decisions,” Beil said. “Most programs are having department discussions and making curricular changes that they think will address the assessment findings and will improve student learning.”
Recent changes that stemmed from academic program reviews include the adoption of new general curriculum requirements by the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences in spring 2010, the revision of the core curriculum and general education requirements in the Elliott School of International Affairs in 2008 and outside accreditation for the GW School of Business and the School of Engineering and Applied Science.
While the national report found that 70 percent of institutions participating in transparency initiatives were more likely to report data from national surveys, Beil said it is important to note that GW’s reported information is shaped by its own measures, not state- or national-level benchmarks.
She explained that accountability assessments can be used punitively against departments or institutions – somewhat at odds with the primary purpose of GW’s evaluations as a tool to improve student learning.
To reach that target, Beil said she wants “programs to be candid in their assessment findings,” rather than selecting measures that “show them in the best light.”
Within the Columbian College each year, all major programs assess at least one program-wide goal and every course in the new general education curriculum will evaluate at least one learning goal for that course.
Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies in Columbian College Daniel Ullman said the best measures of teaching are “multi-faceted ones” that incorporate both student evaluations of teaching and assessments of student learning.
“We want students to be engaged in challenging courses and to succeed in them,” Ullman said.

Two candidates outlined their visions for the Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education’s top office last week, in their vie for the position that has been vacant since 2008.
The candidates, both female and recent college graduates, have experience in substance abuse prevention, but did not delve into explicit details of their goals and plans for the position during presentations last week.
The associate director of CADE is in charge of the University’s substance education and abuse prevention programming, including the “BeWiser” campaign, Responsible Alcohol Manager training and student organization event registration.
Assistant Dean of Students Tara Pereira, who oversees CADE, said her staff will meet Tuesday to discuss the candidates. She hoped a decision would be made in time for the new leader to begin in January, although she said the position will reopen if neither candidate is chosen.
“In a candidate, I am looking for fit with students and the campus culture, the ability to lead, an alignment of philosophies between the candidate and the University, relevant alcohol and other drug experience in a college or university setting and violence prevention experience,” Pereira said.
Candidate Alexis Janda is the coordinator for the alcohol and other drug education program at Fordham University’s Lincoln Center campus. She graduated from the University of Maryland in 2010 with a master’s degree in higher education administration.
Janda suggested that smaller decisions – such as what a student does on a Friday night – ultimately determine their regular behaviors.
“What are your values, what do you value and what’s important to you in your life? Oftentimes, I don’t find that students are actively thinking about that,” she said. “They’re not thinking about how those little decisions impact their life on a larger scale.”
Janda temporarily lived in a fraternity house to mentor students about alcohol and drug consumption, an experience that she said helped her to develop a student-friendly approach to substance education.
“Drug and alcohol education and sexual assault prevention is a tough area, and for a lot of students it’s an awkward area, and if I can be that person that they feel okay with in talking about it, then that’s what I want to do,” Janda said.
Megan Stahl, the other candidate, emphasized a hands-on approach to guiding students during her presentation.
Stahl – a drug and alcohol counselor at Summit Medical Group – graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 2011 with a graduate degree in student affairs in higher education.
“If I’m missing lunch because there’s a student in a crisis situation, then I’m missing lunch,” Stahl said.
She said students are autonomous in their decisions about alcohol, so substance education must go beyond telling students what to do.
“We’re really looking to arm students with the information and resources necessary to make healthy decisions,” Stahl said of her goals.
Stahl said her presentation exhibited her personality, skill set and experience, while Janda said she hoped to spark a dialogue about decision-making.
A third unnamed candidate, who was scheduled to present Dec. 2, withdrew for personal reasons.
The Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education’s associate directorship has been vacant since 2008 when Brian Hamluk left the position. Katie Bean served as assistant director of GW’s substance control office, but left in early September for a similar position at St. Joseph’s University.
Pereira, who assumed a more active role in CADE to compensate for the vacancy, has emphasized her hope that the new leader would have collegiate experience with preventing substance abuse and violence.
The coming year will see a comprehensive evaluation of CADE’s performance and opportunities for growth.
This article was updated on Dec. 5, 2011 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet erroneously reported that Brian Hamluk left the University. In fact, he left his position for another at GW.

Students facing drug charges from the city court might see their cases dismissed if they complete community service, after the opening of a neighborhood-focused courtroom in January.
The D.C. Superior Court will designate a community court for the Second District – which includes Foggy Bottom – offering an alternative channel to settle low-level, non-violent criminal offenses like public drinking or urination, driving violations, drug charges and prostitution, Judge Russell Canan said Wednesday.
Cases within the community court’s jurisdiction would be considered “quality-of-life” cases that could be resolved through social services and community service, Canan said at a Citizens Advisory Council meeting at the Metropolitan Police Department’s Second District station. The meetings offer a forum for police officers and residents to discuss safety-related issues.
Common punishments through community courts can include community service or mandatory rehabilitation through a social service agency, depending on an individual’s offense.
George Corey, the chair of the council, said University students facing court charges for drug use, for example, could complete community service to then have their cases dismissed. Charges stemming from the Metropolitan Police Department and D.C. Superior Court are separate from University charges and judicial procedures.
Following the introduction of community courts for other areas of the city, criminal recidivism rates dropped, Canan said, prompting the court to create additional branches across other police districts.
The District’s two existing community courts were created in 2002. One hears cases related to traffic and misdemeanors like aggressive panhandling, while the other serves East of the River areas.
Senior Judge Truman Morrison, who would act as the presiding judge at the community court, said he is confident the community court will have positive results and “resolve disputes fairly, promptly, correctly.”
“Low-level crime takes away resources and time from dealing with meaningful crime,” he said, explaining the need for a community court.
The system makes residents feel good about their communities, Raymond Norko, the presiding judge at the Hartford Community Court, said. Since the program began in Hartford, Conn. in 1998, defendants have completed thousands of hours of service, he said.
“If everyone thought about it, no major community would be without [community courts],” Norko said.

Frances Norwood’s anthropological research over the past decade has brought her to bedsides in nursing homes and into ethical murkiness as she studied euthanasia in the Netherlands.
Norwood, an assistant research professor and lecturer, talked to doctors who admitted to breaking the Dutch ban on assisted suicide before it was lifted in 1984. She also witnessed a doctor administer enough morphine to kill a patient.
Her study of 14 patients who were considering assisted death shaped her award-winning book in 2009, but it also required her to resolve ethical questions.
“To have these tools and conversations whenever you’re nervous about something in the field is important,” Norwood said.
The problem, Norwood said, was that her main tool for ethical guidance – the American Anthropological Association’s 13-year-old code of ethics – could not keep up with the expanding field.
The association looked to update that code in late November, creating new ethical guidelines for modern anthropologists – who are just as likely to study the culture of urban stockbrokers as they are to observe isolated tribes.
The proposed changes recognize the web of power roles that has developed as anthropologists expand beyond studying vulnerable populations, Damon Dozier, the association’s director of public affairs, said.
Before, anthropologists were ethically bound to ensure the research subject’s well being. Now, the code has expanded to include “a spectrum of ‘do no harm,’ ” Dozier said.
Joel Kuipers, an anthropology and international affairs professor who studies language and culture in Indonesia, said the spectrum recognizes that ethical obligations may be less rigid when it comes to researching subjects who are powerful and wealthy – like the doctors Norwood studied.
“But still, one of the things [the code] is now saying is that it’s very important to do no harm,” Kuipers said.
The code, which was accepted by the association’s executive board and now awaits a member review, is not binding law. It represents only one piece of an ethical puzzle that works in tandem with universities’ institutional review boards.
By reviewing projects during the proposal stage and reevaluating implemented projects at least once a year, GW’s Office of Human Research looks to ensure that any studies involving human subjects do not place them at “undue risk” and requires that subjects give “uncoerced, informed consent to their participation.”
While all researchers at GW work closely with the human research office, anthropological researchers rely on their specialized code as a guiding mindset – rather than a specific set of standards – for their work.
The code update, Kuipers said, underlines the breadth of research areas.
“People who live in jungles and rainforests have cultures, but so do people who work on stock exchange floors, and we need a code of ethics that reflects a greater diversity of contexts that fieldwork gets done,” Kuipers said.
As part of a research team studying autism in South Korea, anthropology and international affairs professor Richard Grinker works with people from other universities and disciplines to perform clinical studies and screenings to complement his sociocultural research.
“The old idea was that anthropologists worked alone, so the guidelines never addressed the issue that you have multiple authors, and it just assumed that the anthropologist is going off into the jungle,” he said.
Grinker added that, while the anthropological association’s ethical code provides a broad outlook, he still works with institutional review boards to examine the cultural implications of his research.
“It’s not like we consult the [anthropological association’s] guidelines on everything we do, because so much of it is common sense,” Grinker said.

For a local restaurant owner, giving back to GW is a family affair – with plenty of fruits and vegetables involved.
In 2010 Annie Leconte, her husband Didier Leconte and her son Eric opened Litestars, a restaurant she describes as a “healthier quick bistro” that specializes in gourmet tartlets, grain-based salads and their newly copyrighted “soupdrinks.”
While Leconte, an alumna, has recipes for dozens of healthy menu items, she was approached by Pi Kappa Phi  to add another key ingredient to the bistro – philanthropy.
Litestars teamed up with  the fraternity to hold a fundraiser at the 21 and L streets location in mid-November . The brothers got a nutritious meal and 10 percent of all the profits earned that evening.
Pi Kappa Phi brother, junior Will Gluckin worked on organizing the fundraiser. The fraternity donated the money to Push America, the national philanthropic organization owned by Pi Kappa Phi.
“Happy hour and healthy food – two of GW’s favorite things,” Gluckin said. “It’s like…if Sweetgreen and Cosi had a baby that likes to drink.”
The food options at Litestars were a change from some of the fraternity members’ usual dinner dishes.
“At first, the guys were not open to having quiche and salad for dinner,” Gluckin said about a group whose usual dinner venues are Burger Tap & Shake and Chipotle.
Menu options at Litesars include fruit smoothies, egg white omelet tartlets, a brown rice salmon salad and frozen yogurts.
“Everything here is made from scratch,” Leconte said, emphasizing the impossibility of buying anything unhealthy at Litestars. “We don’t even have a freezer.”
Litestars wants to continue its partnership with GW, working with Greek life organizations in the future to pair healthy eating with philanthropic causes.
Disheartened by the lack of choices in America besides pizza, hamburgers and fried food, she made it her mission to fight against the growing obesity crisis. Leconte joined the “Chefs Move to Schools” initiative – one facet of Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign – and started educating children about healthy eating.
Based on the brothers’ feedback about the hearty salads and satisfying soups, Gluckin sees the possibility for future events on even larger scales.
Gluckin developed a bond with the Leconte family over shared GW experiences. He said the family business “could be portrayed as a GW success story.”
Chief Operations Officer and son of Annie and Didier Leconte, Eric Leconte graduated from GW in 2005 with a B.A. in business administration, and began working on the restaurant concept one year later.
“I had an equal say in the concept and vision of Litestars,” Eric Leconte, who is still making sure the vision of a healthy bistro is being followed, said.
A special Department of Agriculture software program allows the restaurant to provide nutrition information for every item on the menu, readily available on their website.
“For us, it was a major part of our concept to have that transparency,” he said. “It’s not just a marketing gimmick.”
Although he may not wake up at 4:30 a.m. to swim like his mother does, Eric Leconte still values a healthy lifestyle. Used to his mother’s healthy cooking, he said it was hard for him to adjust to food at GW.
“I was always looking for quick, healthy food,” he said.

It’s that time of year again. Get ready for carols, candy canes and corny holiday specials on television.
But in the hubbub of the holidays, it is easy to forget about the religious meaning behind the festivities.
To counter this disregard, the University should sponsor interfaith events during the season to help students develop a deeper understanding of other faiths and of forming a community around religion.
After all, many celebrate something during December, whether it’s Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or even the Winter Solstice. It’s the time of year that most of us have in common, despite how different our holidays and our faiths might be. And it’s a time that represents coming together with loved ones and celebrating the time we share. While each might be unique, it is a common thread and one of the most meaningful times of the year for people of almost every faith.
GW’s Interfaith Dinner is a great start, but it is in early November – before anyone begins even thinking about the more mainstream, consumer-obsessed holiday season. The dinner should be a starting point in discussion and in action with more events following throughout the months of November and December.
An interfaith day of service would epitomize the values behind interfaith cooperation, especially during a time as important and meaningful as the holidays. In addition to helping the D.C. community at large, an interfaith day of service would allow for the many faiths within the student body to come together in service.
Even President Barack Obama has advocated for interfaith cooperation in acts of community service, and for people of all faiths coming together to help their communities – something he has called “interfaith service.”
But it doesn’t have to stop there. The holiday season, after all, contains days of meaning for many religions. Another option is an event celebrating each of the holidays of the season, featuring all of the major religious groups on campus.
Like an interfaith day of service, such an event would allow for many students of different faiths to come together in celebration.
But an interfaith celebration would allow for people to be directly introduced to the specific qualities that make other religions special, educating themselves while still allowing the student body to come together to celebrate the fact that so many of us have religions. And the event could culminate in a discussion about the meaning of the holidays and the need for interfaith cooperation in facing the problems of the world.
Interfaith events allow for a greater and more meaningful interaction between communities and between students who perhaps would not get the chance to interact often otherwise.
Because no matter how different every faith seems, no matter how different each of our holidays are, many students share the idea and the belief in the power of faith.
After all, isn’t that what the holidays are all about?

In 2008, GW took a chance on a talented student and a war-torn nation by creating a pilot scholarship program for a Sudanese refugee.
Makwei Mabioor Deng, the first Banaa scholarship recipient, has excelled at GW and is preparing for a career in service to the newly-established state of South Sudan.
With the program expanding to other universities, it’s clear that GW’s initial investment was a resounding success.
While GW students are doing the difficult and creative work of fundraising and facilitating the Banaa candidate selection process, the program is at risk of slipping away from GW.
University President Steven Knapp’s administration said it will only fund half of the cost for the next Banaa student after Deng graduates.
It’s not too late to save the program.
With the Clinton Global Initiative University summit taking place on our campus in the spring, University administrators have a perfect opportunity to affirm their commitment.
Clinton Global Initiative University was one of Banaa’s first financial supporters, and President Bill Clinton himself has honored Deng and Banaa co-founders on stage at Clinton Global Initiative events in 2008 and 2009.
Knapp should seize that moment and announce the following: a fully-financed Banaa scholar for enrollment in 2012, an annual visit for Banaa scholars at other universities to GW and a sustained fundraising campaign to support the investment.
This would help build the program by signaling to other interested universities that the flagship institution is committed. It could ultimately help to define a model of the 21st century university as a catalyst for global social progress.
Banaa – named for an Arabic word meaning “to build, found or create” – is unique, not only because it seeks to empower some of the poorest and most marginalized people in an impoverished region, but also because it has been designed and administered entirely by students.
Volunteers from our own campus recruited applicants, verified credentials and built a support network for arriving students. They approached dozens of government and nonprofit workers in Sudan to find potential applicants. They created a modified version of the Common Application to probe applicants’ commitments to attaining peace and development. They created a “how-to” kit to help students on campuses around the country pitch the program to their administrators.
Most importantly, these volunteers crafted a long-term vision. Banaa was designed to empower dozens of talented but impoverished young people with technical skills to serve their communities and conflict-resolution frameworks to forge peace.
Deng is living out this vision. After the destruction of his village when he was 8 years old, he lived for 16 years in Kakuma Refugee Camp near the Kenyan-South Sudanese border. There, he won a scholarship to attend secondary school and took it upon himself to produce the world’s first Dinka language textbook, a project he completed and published while at GW.
Inviting another Banaa scholar would have an immense impact on campus, as it would allow students to build relationships with real survivors of conflict, bring fascinating new perspectives to the classroom and showcase GW’s global leadership in the fields of peace and development.
The writers, Jamie Fisher-Hertz, Ryan Brenner and Kelsey Lax are interns for Banaa.
