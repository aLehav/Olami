Officials said their decision to increase GW's acceptance rate and no longer shy away from admitting “higher-caliber applicants” out of the fear those applicants might not enroll once accepted led to the larger freshman class.
The number of students enrolled at GW has continued to fall this school year as part of a four-year decline, a report the Faculty Senate revealed Friday.
Jay Goff, the vice provost for enrollment and student success, said 25,939 total undergraduate and graduate students are enrolled this semester, a roughly two percent decrease from last fall when officials tallied 26,457 students. Goff said the dip comes as officials enlisted the largest class of new students since 2018, with 2,985 freshmen and transfer students.
Goff said the number of underrepresented minority freshmen who identify as Black, Latino and Indigenous rose from 530 last fall to 642 this semester, while the number of first-generation and Pell Grant recipients rose during the same span by more than 50 and 60 students, respectively. He said while international freshman enrollment is on the rise, officials are still working to elevate international enrollment levels after they faltered under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 150 fewer international freshmen enrolled than in fall 2019.
“We’ve attracted one of the largest, most talented and diverse first-year classes in GW’s history,” Goff said.
Goff said 2,985 new students – including 2,941 freshmen and 44 transfer students – enrolled this semester, exceeding last fall’s new student enrollment by about 10 percent and surpassing officials’ goal by about five percent. He said officials aimed to enroll a larger number of students this academic year to offset the pandemic-related dip in GW’s enrollment numbers.

The University’s acceptance rate rose from 43 percent to 49 percent between the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years, which officials said was the result of a decision to no longer shy away from admitting “higher-caliber applicants” out of the fear they might not enroll upon acceptance.
“The new undergraduate class has 2,985 students and slightly exceeded targets that were set this year,” he said. “This increase also helps us position the potential undergraduate class closer to new student intake levels of years prior to the pandemic.”
Goff said total University enrollment currently sits at 25,939 students – a two percent decrease from fall 2021 and about an eight percent decrease from fall 2018. He said the decrease is primarily the result of the pandemic’s negative financial impact on working adults, who are often the students enrolled in part-time degree programs, as there was a nine percent drop in total part-time enrollment between fall 2021 and fall 2022.
Goff said admissions staff recruited more students from the Midwest and Southeast regions of the country than in previous years to improve the geographic diversity of the new freshmen class. He said the University continues to struggle to recruit students from North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, even though GW is attracting students from the surrounding states and Canada.
There are currently six students from Wyoming, six from North Dakota and seven from South Dakota enrolled in the University, according to institutional research data.
“We do have students from Canada, so we really have kind of a doughnut hole right in the middle in terms of our national, international reach,” he said.
Goff said officials plan to recruit more diverse and academically gifted students and improve the University’s affordability through ongoing scholarship initiatives for the 2023-24 academic year. He said they plan to revive enrollment levels among student populations that decreased during the pandemic, like working adults who enroll in part-time programs, and ensure their recruitment efforts fall in line with GW’s housing and education capacity.
“In staying with our pillars, what we’re going to be doing, specifically in terms of our desired student profile, is that we are not going to back off of the idea of academic excellence,” he said. “We will continue to use that as our primary focal point of trying to find the best, brightest, most dedicated students from throughout the country and the world and continue our trends in diversity and maintaining the affordability levels.”
Earlier in the Faculty Senate meeting, interim University President Mark Wrighton announced he will meet with members of the Board of Trustees this week to discuss the finances of the Medical Faculty Associates and ask what he can publicly share about its finances with the senate.
During a senate meeting last month, faculty senators said they were doubtful that officials would follow through on the plan for the MFA to break even by next June, as the health care nonprofit is currently $200 million in debt.
Susan Kulp, a faculty senator and the co-chair of the senate’s fiscal planning and budgeting committee, said the MFA’s leadership could improve their transparency with the senate by having quarterly check-ins with faculty senators about the MFA’s financial statements.
“I want you to be mindful that we’re in the midst of redeveloping the clinical practice for the school of medicine and people are working very hard,” Wrighton said.
David Diemert – the chair of GW’s Medical Advisory Group, the public health body that advises GW’s COVID-19 policies – also outlined the role of the MAG to the senate. He said the about 20-person group meets biweekly and makes recommendations to officials based on the group’s consensus.
Diemert said the MAG analyzes data from COVID-19 case rates on campus, in the GW Hospital, DC Health statistics and national pandemic trends.
“Our overriding concern has always been from the pandemic and remains to be the health of all students, faculty and staff in the GW community, as well as the health of the surrounding community,” he said.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority’s skepticism about race-conscious admissions could upturn how GW and other universities evaluate prospective students. Students for Fair Admissions, an organization led by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, alleges that Harvard University’s and the University of North Carolina’s admissions policies unfairly reject Asian and white applicants because of their race. The two cases have been working their way through the legal system since 2014, the latest in a series of legal battles stretching back to the 1970s challenging what factors higher education institutions can consider in their admissions processes.
Demanding that universities ignore the backgrounds of their applicants in the name of “race-blind” admissions misunderstands the role of diversity in higher education. “Diversity encourages students to question their own assumptions, to test received truths and to appreciate the complexity of the modern world,” the brief GW and 15 other institutions filed in support of Harvard in the affirmative action lawsuit in 2018 states. And with or without affirmative action as we know it, such diversity is worth defending.
As federal legislation in the 1960s and 1970s aimed to eliminate discrimination against minority groups in education, employment and government contracting, affirmative action programs extended these opportunities to people of color, people with disabilities, women and other minorities in the public and private sector. In the realm of higher education, affirmative action pushed public universities like UNC and private universities that receive federal funding like Harvard to actively enroll students of color after decades of discriminatory admissions.
GW, with its own sordid history of segregation, is no exception. From 1927 to 1959, then-University President Cloyd Heck Marvin ruled the University with an iron fist, suppressing academic freedom, curbing student self-governance and abetting racial intolerance, according to a 1940 Alumni Committee report. In 1938, Marvin wrote that “students of any race or color perform their best” when they are in a “homogenous group, and the University, in its tradition and social environment, has long preserved this policy.” GW officially accepted all students regardless of race in 1954 despite Marvin’s opposition. It was the last D.C. area university to desegregate its admissions process.
Desegregation and officials’ subsequent consideration of prospective students’ backgrounds as part of the admissions process has transformed GW’s student body. Granted, GW is still a predominantly white University – 47.1 percent of all students enrolled in 2021 were white. But from 2012 to 2021, the percentage of Hispanic, Black and Asian students enrolled at GW has respectively increased from 5.9 to 10.2 percent, 8.7 to 10.7 percent and 8.6 to 11.5 percent for Asian students, according to the University’s enrollment dashboard.
Living and learning alongside people whose experiences, identities and perspectives differ from each other is critical to the mission of any university. And while officials at GW and other institutions could certainly do better to clarify their “holistic” admissions process, those who cry foul over affirmative action or bemoan “reverse discrimination” should know that no U.S. college admits or denies prospective students solely because of their race. Race-conscious admissions treat an applicant’s race as one of many factors, like academic performance or extracurricular interests, rather than a decisive one. Doing so expands minority students’ access to historically segregated institutions of higher education.
Affirmative action isn’t the problem – an already exclusive higher education industry that favors wealthier, whiter legacy applicants over others is. In 2011, The Hatchet reported that applicants with a parent who attended GW are 1.5 times more likely to be accepted into the University. So instead of litigating who among thousands of applicants deserves each and every crumb, the solution is to make the metaphorical pie bigger and admit more students of all backgrounds.
Still, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority stands poised to toss affirmative action into the dustbin of history. If they do, GW and universities across the country will have to reevaluate their admissions process, either salvaging their current one or preemptively recruiting more minority applicants through outreach programs, local recruitment offices and scholarship programs. The universities of Michigan and California have been barred from using affirmative action in admissions for more than a decade, and both university systems have struggled to enroll Black, Hispanic and Native American students at their respective campuses. Supposedly race-neutral admissions policies that result in single-digit enrollment percentages of minority students aren’t fair – they’re cutting students’ academic careers short before they can even start.
The University should seize this opportunity to explain how it evaluates an applicant’s race in its admissions process, recognize the members of its student body and put this anti-affirmative action hysteria to bed. Officials have yet to publish the results of this year’s University-wide survey of diversity, equity and inclusion at GW, but the future of its admissions policy is an early and urgent test of its values.
Desegregation marked the beginning of the end of one GW, but creating a diverse student body is a work in progress. Whatever the fate of affirmative action, wiping out prejudice – and acknowledging every facet of students’ identities – will always remain relevant at GW.

My mandatory training as part of New Student Orientation informed me about quick tips on campus, like where to get the best latte, how to create a homework routine – and that I’d need to travel across D.C. if I ever needed a rape kit. The knowledge that neither the GW Hospital nor Student Health Center offers rape kits was one of the most jarring parts of my orientation experience and left me with a pit in my stomach and lingering feelings of confusion and fear. If I find myself a survivor of sexual assault, it will be my responsibility to go to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the only D.C. hospital that provides medical forensic exams, just for the collection of evidence to seek justice. 
This isn’t just hypothetical – it’s a reality for all survivors of sexual assault and violence at GW and in D.C. GW claims to support its students and stand against sexual assault and violence through its Title IX Office, but I feel the University has abandoned me through its complete lack of action. The University has a responsibility to leverage its connections with the GW Hospital to ensure on-campus resources for sexual assault survivors, including the provision of rape kits.
Ambulance services like EMeRG can quickly transport survivors of sexual assault to receive medical services at the GW Hospital, which is owned by Universal Health Services. But because the hospital doesn’t provide rape kits, which are ideally administered between 24 to 48 hours after an assault takes place, patients can’t seek justice after their initial injuries are treated there. Rape kits include tools to collect forensic evidence from a survivor of sexual assault, and the evidence they provide is often necessary for survivors to press charges against their abusers. 
The MedStar Washington Hospital Center receives city funding to provide medical forensic exams through the national Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program, or SANE, which trains and organizes personnel to administer them. Without SANE, which D.C. originally began at Howard University Hospital in 2000, hospitals lack the required expertise to properly administer exams with care and respect to patients. 
When Howard University Hospital withdrew from SANE in 2008, Denise Snyder, the director of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, contacted all major hospitals in the city and received little to no interest in hosting SANE, according to the Washington City Paper. The GW Hospital was “historically resistant to providing [sexual assault] services outside the University community” according to minutes from a SANE meeting on the issue. And Snyder told the Washington City Paper that one hospital feared becoming the “rape hospital,” while others claimed the program would be a financial burden. But one by one, D.C.’s major medical facilities – except for MedStar – refused to help the city’s residents. The GW Hospital’s reluctance to provide rape kits risks the health of those within and far beyond Foggy Bottom – if MedStar chose to discontinue its SANE program, the entire city would be left without access to rape kits. 
GW Hospital’s administration and University officials, whose Student Health Center does not provide rape kits either, have repeatedly turned a blind eye to this gaping hole in sexual assault policy. In 2011, student advocacy groups hosted protests and a vigil to call for rape kits on campus after a study highlighted a majority of students falsely believed they were able to obtain them on campus. In 2015, students circulated a petition with the same demand. And that same year, GW student Eve Zhurbinskiy campaigned for – and won – a seat on the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission with a platform to add forensic medical exams to the GW Hospital. In all instances, the cost of implementing the SANE program, estimated in 2015 to be about $700,000, clouded advocacy efforts. But neither the GW Hospital nor GW itself have examined options to implement SANE and offer forensic exams by other means. 
Considering that 13 percent of all college students experience sexual assault during their academic career, it’s bizarrely unjust that the most accessible and publicized medical facilities on GW’s campus are so wholly unequipped to provide support for survivors of sexual assault. And the off-handed, irresponsible manner in which the University informs students about the lack of rape kits during orientation leaves sexual assault survivors on campus in a deeply emotionally and physically draining situation with both financial and practical barriers to receiving treatment at MedStar. Rape kits are no solution to addressing the root causes of sexual assault and violence, but they are a necessary form of quantifiable evidence with which survivors support their cases in court. Barriers to accessing them make an already-imperfect system worse for survivors.
Though the University may provide survivors with emergency medical attention for their injuries, it still has a responsibility to provide rape kits and the evidence they can collect so survivors can advocate for themselves after the fact. One hospital being equipped to deal with this issue in a major metropolitan area is absolutely unacceptable. Many university students across the country are also calling on their administrations to provide rape kits on campus, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Penn State are among the few universities that already provide these services to students.
The GW Hospital must support students and its surrounding neighborhoods and model moral behavior for the rest of the hospitals in the District by providing easily accessible rape kits. A “not our problem” liability statement during orientation can’t replace comprehensive support for survivors, and it certainly doesn’t cultivate an environment of safety and comfort for students. Students have been demanding rape kits on campus for more than a decade – it’s time to do something about it.

GWPD Chief James Tate said outreach has been a “priority” for the department to reform the department’s image on campus since he took office in January 2020.
The GW Police Department has introduced a pair of trademark events this fall to bolster student outreach efforts as part of GWPD Chief James Tate’s push to establish a culture of community policing in Foggy Bottom.
GWPD kicked off the school year in September with Raise High with GWPD, an event in University Yard where officers handed students food like free Chick-fil-A and pamphlets about the department, before unveiling Coffee with the Chief, where students can discuss campus issues monthly one-on-one with Tate via Webex. More than 10 students said the department’s elevated community engagement efforts have signaled increased transparency from the department, drawing stark differences from a period of limited trust between GWPD and students before Tate arrived at the department in 2020.
“The way to determine if outreach efforts are effective is by listening to students,” Tate said in an email. “We have to connect with students and listen to their feedback. So far, the feedback we have received has been positive. Students have shared that what we are doing is ‘refreshing’ and ‘new.’”
Tate said community outreach has been a “priority” for the department to reform GWPD image on campus since he assumed leadership at the start of 2020 of a department whose leadership had previously hung in question amid fractured student relations. Four months after arriving at GW, Tate called the department’s officer training “woefully inadequate” with minimal deescalation preparation for officers. 
BSU published a letter in June 2020 with eight other student organizations to pressure GWPD to restore trust with the GW community through no-tolerance policies for racial bias cases and a lower presence on campus in light of heightened criticism against policing following the Black Lives Matter protests. The letter also came months after GWPD placed an officer on leave who appeared to push a student down a series of steps at a climate justice protest.
Tate said officers have listened to students through discussion opportunities and events as part of their outreach. He said more students have engaged with GWPD events and approached the department to file incident reports than during previous years – an “encouraging” sign of comfort and familiarity with the department.
Tate said the department organized Raise High with GWPD for the first time this year in September for community members to converse with officers in a “nonlaw enforcement capacity,” and he plans to make the event annual on the Mount Vernon and Foggy Bottom campuses. BSU and Fraternity and Sorority Life collaborated with GWPD to host the event, and Tate said the department plans to collaborate with “various campus departments” and District Connections for future outreach events.
“During our community outreach event on U-Yard, student leaders from FSL and BSU volunteered to work alongside our officers at each station, greeting the community and helping build camaraderie, particularly with first-year students,” Tate said. “I’ve worked at several institutions and have never seen anything like it.”
GWPD also introduced Coffee with the Chief this school year, which takes place on the third Thursday of every month where Tate meets with students who can register one week in advance for 15-minute discussion blocks over a two-hour window. Students can discuss matters of public safety and potential community-building events and partnerships, according to the University’s website.
Students said GWPD’s newly introduced campus outreach events have helped familiarize and build trust between Tate and officers and the GW community. Some said the department could continue to build its advertising efforts by focusing on ongoing safety initiatives with more emails and press releases to advertise departmental updates, including those about campus events.
Gianna Cook – a senior majoring in English and the president of BSU, who was also a member of the administration that sent the letter condemning GWPD in 2020 – said GWPD has significantly “evolved” in the past two years. She said prior to Tate’s arrival on campus, GWPD wasn’t helpful to community members because of their lack of familiarity with students, but now she said officers are going out of their way to greet students, attend organization events and offer opportunities for students to talk with them about policy.
“He makes it mandatory for his officers to engage with students on a personal level because he does care about our general well-being in addition to our safety,” Cook said.
Cook said while BSU and GWPD do not currently have plans for an event in the near future, she wants the partnership between the groups to be “continuous” because BSU represents underrepresented minority groups. She said the partnership is “very beneficial” and helps make Black students feel more comfortable with GWPD’s presence on campus.
“I think it helps with the representation aspect of knowing that our voices matter,” Cook said. “I would hope that in the next couple of months and just even years after that, that partnership is still the mindset instead of the us-vs.-them mindset it might have been in the past.”
Michael Graham-Green, a senior majoring in political science, attended Raise High with GWPD in U-Yard last month and said the event demonstrated a willingness among officers to connect with students.
“It’s definitely better than no outreach at all,” Graham-Green said. “I’m not sure if it really made me more likely to interact with GWPD in the future, but it was better than just having them closed off in that building over there and not having any interaction.”
Graham-Green said the event made him more “comfortable” approaching GWPD officers.
“That was probably the best way they could have gone about it to be honest with you,” Graham-Green said. “I’m not sure if it necessarily will make a lasting difference, but I think it’s the best way they could do it.”
Dinorah Martell, a senior majoring in international affairs, said GWPD could promote lesser-known initiatives like its safety app more effectively through increased advertising to better educate the GW community about their resources. She said further promotion of the GW Guardian app, which allows students to be notified if their friends don’t arrive home on time, could help with outreach efforts.
“GW can do more about spreading those kinds of apps instead of GWPD because I hear more from GW than GWPD,” she said.
Lauren Beauvais, an undecided freshman, said the outreach events helped students understand the role of GWPD on campus.
“I think that it allows people to have more of an understanding of what they’re doing so they understand the process better and what their job is,” she said.

Under Biden's proposed change, the definition of sexual harassment and discrimination would include acts of sex discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes and characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation and gender identity.
Officials said GW is preparing to offer mandatory Title IX training to faculty and staff pending the approval of proposed federal regulations from the Department of Education.
President Joe Biden’s administration’s proposed changes would mandate all faculty and staff attend Title IX training instead of just Title IX Office employees, broaden the legal definition of sexual harassment and discrimination at colleges and universities to include protections for LGBTQ+ students and bar discrimination against pregnant students and employees. Charles Bendit, the chair of the Board of Trustees Audit and Compliance Committee, called a 20-percent faculty participation in voluntary Title IX training at GW “unacceptable” during the Board’s meeting in May. 
While ED has not published a timeline for the implementation of the final Title IX changes, updates to federal Title IX regulations under the administration of former President Donald Trump took the department about a year and a half to implement after introducing them because of public comment and ED revision.
Caroline Laguerre-Brown, the vice provost for diversity, equity and engagement at GW, said the federal government only requires that Title IX Office personnel receive training on how to deal with accusations of discrimination and sexual harassment, but under the new rules, all University employees will be required to complete training on sex-based discrimination under Title IX regulations.
“In the coming weeks, the provost’s office will work with our deans to reinforce and ensure full participation in preventing harassment and discrimination, which includes all the necessary timeline content for faculty and staff,” she said.
Five of GW’s 12 peer schools – the University of Miami and Boston, New York, Tufts and Syracuse universities – already have mandatory training for their faculty and staff. Officials required incoming GW students to complete both virtual and in-person Title IX training courses and an online sexual assault prevention module this fall.
Laguerre-Brown said the Title IX Office will be able to respond more broadly to different types of gender discrimination under the Biden administration’s proposed Title IX changes. Under the potential updates, the definition of sexual discrimination would now include acts of sex discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation and gender identity, according to ED’s website.
“All of these additional protections are currently covered under the University’s broad anti-discrimination policy, but not currently under the Title IX policy,” Laguerre-Brown said at the Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
Biden’s Title IX policy would reverse the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce Title IX protections, which narrowed the definition of sexual harassment to be any form of unwelcome conduct that is “serious, pervasive and objectively offensive.” Trump’s Title IX policy also required post-secondary institutions to hold live hearings for sexual misconduct cases, where witnesses were allowed to be cross-examined.
She said officials formed a Title IX regulations task force in July to review the changes to federal Title IX policy the White House proposed in June and receive feedback from the community on how best to implement it. She said the task force will hold an online forum with community members in the coming weeks to receive feedback about the rule changes.
Experts in higher education Title IX policy said Title IX training helps faculty and staff navigate how to respond to sexual harassment and gender discrimination complaints. They said the low number of employees who have participated in the training at GW could pose a “danger” to students, who may not be able to get the assistance they need without trained staff.
Adrienne Lyles, the executive director and Title IX coordinator in the Office for Gender Equity and Inclusion at the University of Cincinnati, said GW’s nonrequired training and low rate of faculty completion is typical for universities because of the difficulties in coordinating voluntary training for hundreds of employees. The current federal policy only requires staff in the Title IX office to be trained, not all other faculty and staff.
“I do not think it’s just Title IX,” she said. “Faculty, like everyone, they’re tired. They feel overwhelmed. And, if whatever training it is isn’t created with their participation and buy-in, it’s hard to get them to want to do it. And that’s not a Title IX thing, that’s a training thing. And it is nationwide.”
Christina Percoski, a training specialist at Syracuse University, said Syracuse registered 100 percent participation among its employees as part of mandatory Title IX training during the previous academic year. She said New York requires annual sexual harassment prevention training for employers with a staff larger than 15 people.
The District does not require colleges and universities to conduct Title IX training for faculty and staff, but other local institutions – like American, Catholic and Gallaudet universities – require their employees to receive training once hired.
Percoski said increasing participation numbers for voluntary Title IX training can be “difficult” with faculty balancing heavy workloads and conflicting obligations. She said mandatory Title IX training gives all employees the same level of knowledge on how to deal with sexual assault and gender discrimination complaints.
“I think the danger there is that a student might not get information that they might need to make the decision that is right for them in that situation,” she said. “The first person that a victim of sexual violence connects with makes such an impact on how that person gets help.”
All faculty members at GW are designated reporters, meaning they are required to report accusations of sexual harassment, assault and domestic violence to GW’s Title IX coordinator, according to the Title IX Office website.
Susan Stone – an attorney and the co-chair of the Student and Athlete Defense Title IX Practice Group at Kohrman, Jackson and Krantz law firm in Ohio – said Title IX training could benefit all campus community members to guarantee students are aware of the resources offered to them and faculty are aware of their duties as trusted employees.
She said training can educate faculty about their role and responsibilities as mandatory reporters. The proper way to handle a Title IX complaint can be “confusing” for faculty if training is not required, she added.
“Certain people are defined in policies as mandatory reporters,” Stone said. “So if you hear of someone who might have been sexually assaulted, certain people are identified, and they have to report to the Title IX office that they believe someone’s been assaulted.”
Sandra Hodgin, the founder and CEO of Title IX Consulting Group, a company that advises colleges and universities on how best to handle Title IX policies and complaints, said the University could be prone to legal troubles if officials improperly handled a future sexual harassment claim while faculty and staff remain without Title IX training. Last fall, student leaders alleged the University mishandled sexual assault reports, leaving survivors fearful their abusers would return to campus.
“Campuses, when they are not looking at best practices because they feel that it’s not mandatory or required, they’re really missing the bigger picture and they are misstepping in areas where it could lead to a lawsuit,” she said. “That really is what they are trying to avoid the most in staying compliant.”

A COVID-19 testing trailer occupied the lot across from University Yard during the previous academic year before officials reassigned three locations on the Foggy Bottom Campus as new testing sites.
Updated: Nov. 14, 2022 at 10:25 a.m.
Faculty senators passed a resolution in support of building a new 320-bed residence hall at the abandoned lot on the corner of 20th and H streets during a Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
The resolution endorses previous plans to construct a residence hall that officials paused during the COVID-19 pandemic, urges the administration to resume planning with “deliberate speed” and recommends the project be placed near or at the top of the University’s spending budget. With 22 yes votes, four no votes and one abstention, the resolution states the new residence hall is critical to attracting new students after the recent renovations of Thurston Hall, which removed 280 beds from the building and “substantially reduced” undergraduate housing.
Officials announced plans to build a new residence hall in December 2018 with hopes of finishing construction this fall, but COVID-19 suspended their plans. The 2018 blueprint for the 10-story building feature loft-style common rooms, community kitchens and retail space.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton said he feels “very positive” about advancing the plans for a new residence hall, which presents an opportunity to improve the student experience at GW.
“I think as I’ve spoken in many settings, we have a need to improve the uniformity of facilities across the institution,” Wrighton said. “That includes both academic and residential space.”

Eric Grynaviski, a member of the senate’s Educational Policy and Technology Committee and co-chair of the senate’s Physical Facilities Committee, presented the resolution to the faculty senators and said the new residence hall is necessary to provide flexibility for GW’s undergraduate enrollment targets. He also said the new residence hall can provide extra beds for students who may be moved around during any major renovations of other residence halls.
Grynaviski, an associate professor of political science, said there’s a “necessity for anchoring” the H Street lot to campus, providing dining options and improving the student experience for graduate students.
“I think that this resolution is actually not something which is particularly controversial,” Grynaviski said.
Faculty senators from GW Law backed the expansion of housing space but were hesitant to throw their support behind the location of the new residence hall across the street from the school’s Lerner and Stockton halls, expressing frustration over their lack of involvement in the plans.
Jeffrey Guttman, a professor of clinical law and a faculty senator, said he supports the construction of a new residence hall, but he and his colleagues at GW Law felt they weren’t included in the plans for building the hall. He said the construction of the residence hall across the street from the law school buildings impacts GW Law because of its proximity, and he hopes officials will include law school faculty in future plans to develop residence halls on campus.
“I don’t doubt that we need another dorm and maybe two more dorms,” Guttman said. “The question in my mind is where to locate them.”
Phil Wirtz, a professor of decision sciences and psychology and a faculty senator, said the administration and Faculty Senate committees have examined the H Street location as the potential residence hall construction site and decided it would be the most suitable of any potential alternatives.
“If it hadn’t been for COVID, the dorm would have been built by now,” Wirtz said.
