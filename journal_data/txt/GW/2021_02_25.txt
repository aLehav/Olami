Robinette said officials would turn to experts like residential staff to handle the RA responsibilities.
Updated: Feb. 25, 2021 at 8:08 p.m.
The University will cancel the Resident Adviser program, transferring responsibilities to residential staff and providing employment positions for residential life for more than 200 students in the upcoming academic year.
Stewart Robinette, the assistant dean of students, said in an email to the current RA cohort that officials will transfer all “counseling, safety and on-call” responsibilities to professional staff members living in each residence hall to “reimagine” the RA program and the Campus Living and Residential Education team. The email states the move will help the Division for Student Affairs offer more Federal Work Study and student wage positions than the 142 RA roles that were planned for last fall.
Robinette said officials would turn to experts like residential staff to handle the RA responsibilities, which he said carried a level of complexity that generated concerns from previous RAs who struggled to support other students.
“We have come to the determination that the increasing demands placed on an RA are not sustainable for a student to be successful as they balance their academics, form social connections with their peers and prepare for a life after graduation,” the email states.
The RA program has been on pause since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and officials suspended the program for both the fall and spring semesters of this academic year.
The email states officials will offer nine new groups of student employment positions open to more than 200 students next academic year, which include programming, operations, desk support, peer mediation, faculty program support, communications, social media, assessment and semester transitions.
Robinette said officials will create a “predetermined set” of weekly hours for each new position at the start of each semester so students can plan their time better than RAs. He said RAs often struggled to work around a position that never featured a standard schedule.
The email states returning RAs will receive automatic acceptance to the new “Transitions Opening & Closing staff” position if they apply, offering $1,500 in housing credit per semester of work.
“These focused positions will allow students to gain a deeper development and build upon a skill set in an area they are most interested in,” the email states.
Robinette said officials will continue partnering with the Residence Hall Association and the National Residence Hall Honorary. He said the Faculty in Residence program will continue to support residential students with resources and be a source of “intellectual engagement” for residents.
He added that current members of the RA cohort will still receive their RA cords for graduation.
“The student voice in our residence halls will continue to be a priority and an integral part of our ongoing commitment to fostering an engaged student community stimulated by culture, intellectual diversity and a cohesive living and learning experience for all of our students,” he said.
Robinette said in an interview that he compiled feedback for the overhaul from exit interviews, focus groups and “action teams” with former RAs over the past five years, meetings with the Residence Hall Association and communication with area coordinators and community directors. He said each group that officials consulted also raised safety concerns about the RA position.
“Safety of our students and safety of our RAs is of the utmost importance, and that’s not just because it’s the right thing to do,” he said. “It’s also because of when we’re talking to students, that’s what they want, as they should, and for when we’re talking to their families, that’s what they want also. And so that was a huge part of the decision making.”
Robinette added that unlike the RA program, the new student employment positions won’t impact financial aid packages, and students won’t need to wait for their packages to process after accepting the position. He said RA candidates who learned about their employment in March would typically need to wait to learn how that would impact their financial aid package, creating different effects on different students.
“It does not impact their financial aid package like it did under the RA model, and what that means also is that now rather than finding out that you’re an RA in March, which used to be our old process and then having to wait to see exactly what your complete financial aid picture is going to be for a while, now you can be like, ‘Alright, I know how this is going to impact me,'” Robinette said.
Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Cissy Petty said the COVID-19 pandemic helped officials take the time to reassess issues facing students and RAs, which have been “magnified” during the pandemic. Petty said RAs might be placed into uncomfortable situations as they’re counseling residents in response to noise complaints, sexual assault cases or students who are intoxicated or “belligerent.”
She said one senior RA shared safety concerns about doing rounds and walking between residence halls on campus, and Petty noted how the recent political climate of current events has intensified these concerns.
“Think about what you’ve gone through in the last decade, and then think about what happened last year, and then think about what’s even happened this year – not just the pandemic, but the insurrection at the Capitol, and the Black Lives Matter movement and the number of deaths,” she said in the interview. “That is an emotional weight that can’t help to spill into your collegiate experience.”

Shouk's mushroom-based meat alternative is worth a try for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. 
Head just north of Chinatown to try out plant-based, Israeli-inspired meals from Shouk.
Shouk is located at 655 K St. NW, off of the Yellow and Green lines at Mount Vernon Square. The restaurant offers a D.C.-certified Kosher menu of vegan Middle Eastern dishes, so it will have a meal for you regardless of any dietary restrictions.
The eatery offers takeout, which took about 10 minutes to prepare when I visited, and no-contact delivery to customers, and it’s open every day of the week from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. With dish prices ranging from $9 to $13, Shouk’s options shouldn’t break your bank account.
Visitors can choose from the falafel sandwich ($10.50), salads, award-winning veggie burger ($12) and house-made hummuses. Shouk also touts market menu items like chili ($10), shouk spice ($5.50) and almond feta ($6.50).
As a vegetarian who loves Middle Eastern food, I can usually only order a falafel bowl with some veggies. But because the meals are plant-based, I knew I had to deviate from my normal order and try something new.
In the mood for something deep-fried, I opted for the Fried Shouk’n ($11.50), a fried oyster mushroom wrapped inside of pita bread with green cabbage, pickles and harissa mayo. The order came in an enclosed, small cardboard box so the sandwich wouldn’t fall apart while I brought it back home.
As someone who is not a big fan of mushrooms, I admittedly was hesitant to eat a mock fried chicken made with mushrooms. But the mushrooms were thin and deep-fried, masking the taste of the fungi and satisfying my craving for fried food.
The green cabbage and pickles added a tangy and salty taste to the dish, complementing the fried mushroom. The pita sandwich was also topped with harissa mayo, a smooth and creamy sauce – with just a small kick of spice and garlic – to balance out the salty and tangy flavor from the vegetables.
When I usually eat salty and savory fried comfort meals, I feel lethargic. But after eating the dish, I felt satisfied and energized and recommended the dish to my D.C.-area friends who are both vegan and meat eaters.
While the Fried Shouk’n filled me up, I’m eager to return to try one of the restaurant’s sweets, like the Choco Cardamom cookie, or buy an ingredient from the restaurant’s market menu, like the harissa sauce, to use when cooking at home.
For plant-based meals that will satisfy you, give Shouk a try.

Humanities disciplines at GW are in dire need of a more structured curriculum. But for departments to create such a curriculum, the University needs to funnel more money to humanities disciplines like history and gender and sexuality studies.
During the hour and 15 minutes of Gender and Sexuality in Bollywood, a 3170 level course, our sessions rarely include robust discussions on complex theories relating to gender and sexuality. Instead, most of the students treat the course as an easy respite from their real majors. Not only are we not expected to have completed any prerequisite courses on film or gender and sexuality, but we also are not even expected to enter the course with basic knowledge about Bollywood cinema.
Through no fault of the professor, the course has become a hotbed of tepid discussion, rarely giving students who are genuinely interested in understanding gender theory the opportunity to learn new ideas and challenge their existing opinions. I have experienced a similar disappointment with most of the upper-division courses I have taken as an upperclassman majoring in history. Anybody from freshmen to seniors can take upper-division courses that ideally should be reserved only for sophomores, juniors and seniors who have taken a specific set of prerequisite courses to prepare for courses that build upon those prerequisites.
Students of any major deserve to grow through their program and advance their studies as they move toward graduation. That has not been my experience in GW’s upper level humanities courses. My classmates and I must be able to undergo the same premiere education as our peers in other well-funded programs, and we cannot ignore the fact that GW does not want to allot money to a smaller humanities department like WGSS. The program could and should be better, but it needs more funding.
Other departments have seen similar issues. The religion department was forced to shrink its course offerings three years ago because it did not have enough money to fund courses that covered four different religions. At the time, there were no full-time faculty that specialized in either Hinduism or Buddhism, which are two of the six major religious traditions that are part of the basic curriculum for religion majors. And most recently, professors have called on officials to implement a “cluster hire” of underrepresented faculty and provide enough money for the Africana studies program to become its own department. This requires money, and officials should not overlook it.
We now know that administrators are likely no longer looking to grow the share of STEM students and reduce the overall student population. In that decision, there is a glimmer of hope that officials can turn their attention to the departments that desperately want to grow. My classmates and I should not need to take an upper-level class with freshmen who are just studying the material for the first time.
Courses must be productive spaces that push students to grow out of their comfort zones and challenge their beliefs, and more funding for my department and several others would help accomplish that.

The past four years have caused a dramatic shift in national identity and everyday life, from interactions with family members to whether we wear a mask on a walk. We have former President Donald Trump to thank for this change, and we should never forget that.
Since Trump left office, it feels refreshing to look forward to the future of the United States. We no longer need to rummage through the countless tweets from Trump, trying to discern what is true and what is not. More than that, we might be more inclined to make a mockery of Trump and think back on his time like it was a bad breakup 20 years ago. But it was not. His mark has been left on this country, and we must continue to hold him accountable as a continued public figure in the United States.
In the wake of the Trump administration, many look to diminish the former president’s role in our country. Students, influencers and night show hosts have referred to him as a “former social media influencer,” “Home Alone 2 actor” or “former reality tv-star” in their tweets, Instagram stories and opening monologues. But let’s face it: He is not completely out of the spotlight. Trump needs to be held accountable for the impact his presidency has had on the nation. Even though he is not in office, we are still living with severe COVID-19 restrictions, while other countries’ leaderships have mastered slowing the virus’s spread.
He is not a person we can joke about, at least for now. Making light of his impact disconnects Trump from the aftermath of his presidential term that we still face today. Continuing to hold him accountable is the first step in recovering from his administration, but we seemed to have skipped past the recovery stage and begun to talk about him like unbearable middle school years.
Students, faculty and staff must remember that D.C. is still in a state of fragility from the U.S. Capitol attack in response to the 2020 election results. The GW community should keep in mind the lasting impact he has had on the District, from soaring COVID-19 caseloads to considering the use of “heat rays” on Black Lives Matter protesters last summer. These national regressions have caused undeniable harm and have directly impacted the student experience at GW. Joking about Trump and discrediting his administration turns Trump into a character, distancing the former president from the very real impacts of his term.
Diminishing Trump’s role to that of an influencer or actor takes away the power he held. Students cannot turn Trump into a joke, because we need to use his presidential term as a foundation for change. Students must continue to point out his shortcomings and lead the charge for healing. We should not use satire to move on from his term because his impact continues to percolate into everyday American life.
The country’s shutdown, D.C.’s fragility and our compromised college experiences are not the result of a reality television star, a social media influencer or the guy from “Home Alone 2.” The current state of our society lies on the shoulders of the former president of the United States. We cannot forget that.

Aborisade said he wanted to use “some” of the SA executive budget – which amounts to roughly $50,000 a year – to create an “online textbook pantry” for students to access their materials online.
A Student Association senator announced his campaign for SA president Wednesday, running on a platform to increase grant funding for students and expand student organization programming.
SA Sen. Charles Aborisade, U-at-Large and the chair of the finance committee, said he hopes to advocate for more funding opportunities for students pursuing unpaid internships and increase the SA’s outreach to student organizations. He said his experience serving in the finance committee and working alongside student organizations helps him understand how to improve connections with students.
“We can all attest to this pandemic has made it hard for students to organize in the typical meaningful ways that they do in person,” Aborisade said. “Being able to understand those struggles and understand those situations, I think I am providing the unique position to usher the school, Student Association, as well as the student body into an era when hopefully in the fall we will receive more engagement, more interaction with students and hopefully this will be a gradual transition back to normal.”
Aborisade is the second candidate to announce his run for president, following current SA President Brandon Hill.
Aborisade is required to gather at least 250 signatures during the candidate registration period from Feb. 24 to March 3 and be approved by the Joint Elections Commission to qualify as a candidate. The senate approved legislation in November that reduced the number of required signatures for candidates to run this year in half.
Aborisade said if elected, he would work to allocate money from the SA executive budget to Knowledge in Action Career Internship Fund grants. He said he would reach out to parents and alumni – who fund the grant – to explore ways to grow the fund.
The GW Career Services Council offers KACIF grants to financially support students taking unpaid internships, on average allocating between $750 to $1,500 for students in domestic internships and roughly $2,000 to $3,000 to students with international internships.
He said he also wants to use “some” of the SA executive budget – which amounts to roughly $50,000 a year – to create an “online textbook pantry” for students to access their materials online. He said SA leaders could also use the pantry to purchase textbooks for students and offset other students’ fees.
Aborisade said he also wants to create an initiative titled “AborisAid” to increase funding for student organizations to host programming. He said he would also create a coalition made up of SA senators and student organization leaders to meet with administrators to provide more representation for student organizations on University issues.
“Whether it comes to advocating for reduced costs for graduate students or whether it be for advocating for certain events on campus or certain changes to be made on campus, I want to build a rainbow coalition that can help support the voices of the students,” he said.
Aborisade said he wants to transition the SA’s budget allocations into a two-step process where student organizations would requests funds at the end of the spring semester and the end of next fall semester. He said the SA finance committee currently only has one budget allocation per year, which he said forces organizations to plan for events a year in advance.
He said he would work to create a more flexible exam submission schedule to improve the virtual learning environment. He said if elected, he would work with the deans of the schools to allow students to have 24 hours to complete their midterm and final exams once they open them online in a virtual or hybrid environment.
“I know a lot of classes and teachers have already implemented such a thing, which is absolutely great, but I want to see if we can expand those to more classes particularly as it relates to these other different schools on campus,” he said.

Packer said in her role as the founder and chair of the LGBTQ+ Caucus, she has been working with senators to urge officials to allow transgender students to be able to live with a roommate of their choice regardless of gender.
A Student Association senator announced her bid for SA vice president Monday, hoping to increase mental health resources in the Colonial Health Center and advocate for greater graduate student representation.
SA Sen. Sofia Packer, CCAS-U, is running on a platform to facilitate equity and inclusion initiatives across campus and increase representation for graduate students. She said she will continue ongoing advocate efforts to reduce graduate student tuition in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and work with senators and officials to create inclusivity training for students.
“We’re just disconnected,” Packer said. “We need to meet with people. We need to make ourselves more open. We shouldn’t be this big, secretive body that a lot of people view us as.”
Packer is required to gather at least 250 signatures during the candidate registration period from Feb. 24 to March 3 and be approved by the Joint Elections Commission to qualify as a candidate. The senate approved legislation in November that cut the number of required signatures in half for candidates to run this year.
Packer is the second candidate to join the race, after SA Sen. Kate Carpenter, U-at-Large and a Hatchet photographer.
Packer said she will prioritize pushing officials to diversify faculty hires if elected. She said she has been involved with efforts to request a “cluster hire” of 18 faculty members of color for the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and will work with senators and administrators to expand this initiative across other schools.
“This is an effort that will have to be done school by school because each school has its own hiring practices separate from the others,” Packer said. “And realistically, much of that decision is made by department chairs and the deans of those schools and then just signed off by people more centralized in the administration.”
Packer said in her role as the founder and chair of the LGBTQ+ Caucus, she has been pushing officials to update GW’s housing policy for transgender students to be able to live with a roommate of their choice regardless of gender. She said if elected, she would also encourage deans and department chairs to use a student’s preferred name instead of their legal name.
Packer said she also wants to add mental health specialists to the Colonial Health Center who specialize in working with students in marginalized groups, like LGBTQ and religious groups and communities of color.
“I think a lot of students of marginalized communities would be able to get more out of it if they had someone who had a greater understanding of their specific set of issues,” she said.
She said she will also promote “inclusivity training” for students and faculty on providing recognition to respective sexualities, gender identities and pronoun use.
Packer said she will work with officials to create a plan to gradually increase the number of gender-neutral bathrooms across campus. She said she hopes to advocate for administrators to add “a few” gender-neutral bathrooms throughout campus over the span of a few years.
She said if elected, she will advocate for graduate students in areas like applying a tuition reduction during the virtual semesters, adding that she commends the work of the Graduate Senators Caucus that has pushed for a tuition reduction this academic year.
“This needs a more activist approach, where you start organizing students to really put broader public pressure on the University about this,” she said.
Officials announced in July that undergraduate students would receive a 10 percent tuition reduction for this academic year. Graduate students have pushed the University to do the same for them through a petition launched earlier this year and a statement from graduate senators.
Packer said she also wants the SA executive branch to facilitate more connecting opportunities, like hosting events, for the student body to meet directly with SA leaders.
“I’ve noticed that there’s a lot of talk of, ‘Oh, I’m doing this for constituents or I’ve gathered constituent input on this issue,’ but we never see a public process for how that’s done,” she said.
She added that she would expand on initiatives senators have used this year to speak with students, like first-year senator forums and graduate student caucus town halls, to gather student feedback.
“If the VP, especially is leading by example and getting that direct feedback from the student body, and then encouraging senators to do the same in a way that we’ve never really seen before, that’s going to be really important,” Packer said.

Leaders from the Black Law Students Association hosted a discussion on the future of the 2021 Black political agenda Saturday.
The Rev. Al Sharpton, an MSNBC news host and civil rights leader, talked about Black political activism and grassroots organizing following widespread demonstrations across the world denouncing police brutality and systemic racism. BLSA President and senior Naseem Haamid moderated the virtual event, which was inspired by the 1972 National Black Political Convention.
Sharpton said the 1972 convention, during which thousands of Black Americans gathered to develop a political strategy, brought together several Black leaders with differing political beliefs. He said the historic event should serve as an example for inspiring cooperation during the current political climate.
“It brought all the elements of the Black community together, from hard core Black nationalists to Black revolutionaries to those who believed in the electoral process to those who believed in the civil rights movement to those who believed in self-defense,” he said. “So the magic of the convention when I was there was that they found a way to come together and set an agenda even though they had tactical and philosophical differences.”
Sharpton said moving forward, the Black political agenda should focus on three major pieces of legislation, namely the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill aiming to reform policing procedures; the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, a bill that would help protect against voter suppression; and H.R. 40, a bill seeking to establish a commission to study and develop reparations proposals.
“In 2021, these are some of the basic things we can agree on no matter our politics or religion, or lack of, and whatever our gender or sexual orientation may be,” he said.
Sharpton added that while politics is “tedious” and “difficult,” young people should not lose faith in the democratic process to advance social justice.
“I don’t think that politics solves all our problems,” he said. “I don’t think voting is a magic wand. But when you are a tenth of white wealth in this country – whites are 10-to-1 more wealthy in terms of median income in this country – you don’t have the luxury of saying ‘I want one silver bullet that will solve all my problems.’ You use everything available to you. Voting is available to you.”
Sharpton said his experiences watching the civil rights movement unfold during the 1960s taught him that public protests are integral for achieving legislative change.
“When Selma happened, President Lyndon B. Johnson began using the public drama of Selma to advance the 1965 Voting Rights Act,” he said. “Nonviolent protest doesn’t solve the problem, it dramatizes the problem. If you don’t dramatize the problem the public does not know or deal with the severity of the problem.”
Sharpton also said the Black electorate should remain engaged in grassroots organizing and work to hold political leaders like President Joe Biden accountable. Biden’s victory was in part driven by Black voter turnout in battleground states like Georgia, The Associated Press reported.
“We need to make sure that promises made are promises kept,” he said. “Most of them will keep their word if they see you are organized and have the numbers to back yourself up.”

Gale said as a traditional day student, she does not share the same experiences as her transfer or non-J.D. constituents.
The Student Bar Association Senate passed a resolution to amend its constitution, allowing for the organization to vote in two new senators, during a meeting Tuesday.
SBA Sens. Andrew Latham and Rachel Gale co-sponsored a resolution that would allow for the body to create two new senator positions, a 3L transfer senator and another non-J.D. division senator. The new positions would be filled during a special election this spring, according to the legislation.  
“Representation is the core of the advocacy that the senate provides,” Latham said. “We are the intermediary between our constituents and the administration. The more voices present, the louder we are and the more difficult it is for them to be snuffed out. It is imperative that this body speak louder now more than ever.” 
Gale, the other SBA senator who sponsored the resolution, said as a traditional day student, she does not share the same experiences as her transfer or non-J.D. constituents. She said the students constitute a “significant” portion of the GW Law student body and should be represented in the SBA.
“It is time for these students to have their voices that are heard through an additional non J.D. senator and a 3L transfer,” Gale said.
Also at Tuesday’s meeting, SBA President Jacqueline Fisher said the executive committee will meet with law school Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew later this week to discuss Dean Susan Fine’s resignation as dean of professional development and career strategy. Fisher said the executive committee has been hearing “serious concerns” that students lack a functional career center without Fine’s leadership.
Fisher added that the SBA will launch a survey compiling anecdotal data about how Fine’s resignation affects students’ applications to law careers.  
“I encourage your constituents to take it,” she said. “It’ll help us target what students need support where and where some of the pitfalls are falling through. And as they’re making decisions about how to restructure the career center with Dean Fine leaving, we see that as an opportunity to really push the student perspective.”
The SBA also unanimously passed legislation to create the Administrative Law Society, a student organization that will work to educate students about administrative law and connect students interested in the subject. Steven Hess, the group’s founder, said the group will have the opportunity to bring in and publicize events with “important scholars.”
“It’s important to every other field that’s going on whether or not you’re doing environmental issues, whether or not you’re doing contracts is important when you’re working with the government,” Hess said. “And it’s going to continue to be working with the government.”
SBA senators also unanimously approved a $400 funding request by the GW African Law Association for a cooking demonstration they will be hosted online later this semester. Sen. Joshua Gilmer, the finance committee chair, said the funds will be distributed to participants to purchase their own ingredients. 
“It sounds like a really exciting event,” Gilmer said. “In addition to urging you all to vote in favor of this bill, I also urge you to reach out to the organization and express your interest in their event and attend if you’re able.”

The law school currently has three active endowment funds, which are used to support scholarships, libraries, programs and students.
A law school alumnus will donate $2 million to the University to be used for a scholarship fund for law students.
Kenneth Jaconetty, who earned a Juris Doctor in 1988, has made a gift of $2 million to create the endowed Kenneth E. Jaconetty Scholarship Fund, according to a University release. The fund will provide need-based aid to GW Law students who are interested in studying intellectual property law and are also enrolled in the Black Law Students Association or are members of a Native American tribe.
“The background you need to go into this profession can be more limiting in terms of race and ethnicity because typically to be a patent attorney,” Jaconetty said in the release. “You have to have a technical degree such as some sort of engineering or science-based degree.”
The law school currently has three active endowment funds, which are used to support scholarships, libraries, programs and students.
Jaconetty said the donation, which was inspired by recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations and his own experience at the school, will hopefully work to combat inequalities in patent law.
“I had a light bulb moment that this was a way I could make maybe a small difference in addressing some of the long-standing issues in this country,” he said.
The endowment fund follows a push by University President Thomas LeBlanc to provide additional financial aid for students.
Officials announced in October that GW had received $22.5 million in donations to use toward financial aid, including the University’s largest one-time donation, and officials would work to increase alumni donations throughout the University’s bicentennial.
Dayna Bowen Matthew, the dean of the law school, said Jaconetty’s scholarship fund will help promote a diverse student body.
“His gift will ensure that generations of talented students, regardless of financial resources, will have equal access to a top-quality GW Law education,” she said.
