When the final buzzer sounded on men’s basketball’s five-point upset victory over No. 6 Virginia in 2015, a sold-out Smith Center crowd stormed the court in excitement.
Lauren Shear, a junior and an intern for the athletic department’s communications office at the time, was working her first game that night. Shear said she hadn’t attended many athletic events on campus before the upset win, but when she saw the court pack with fans, she knew she wanted a career in sports.
Earlier this month, Shear came full circle, moving on from the athletic communications office becoming the director of operations for the men’s basketball program. She said she will be responsible for the “typical” team travel, scheduling and coordinating food, and head coach Jamion Christian tasked her with helming alumni relations and the team’s leadership and mentorship programs.
She said Christian offered her the position after the two talked about her career goals and what she wanted to pursue next in the sports field.
“Jamion looked at me and was like, ‘Aim higher. You can do so much more’ and started talking about different things that I could potentially do,” Shear said. “He saw something within me that I didn’t really see at the moment.”
Shear, who has two Canadian parents, said her love of hockey pushed her into the sports industry. She added that from a young age, she hoped to one day be the vice president of marketing, communications or public relations for an NHL team.
But as she spent more time working in the athletic department, Shear said she began to develop a passion for student-athlete development. She spent five years in the athletic communications office, taking the communications associate position after graduating with a communications degree in 2017.
“Working at GW a lot, I really got to know our student-athletes and really love getting to help them figure themselves out and develop them and really enjoy their experience at GW,” Shear said. “I wanted to explore collegiate athletics a little bit more.”
Shear said she worked with about 10 programs throughout her time at GW in her communications role and had the opportunity to develop relationships with a range of student-athletes. But in her new role, Shear said she is most excited about developing stronger relationships with one team.
“To have the opportunity to really dial in and just work with one team and build really strong relationships, to me, that’s the part that makes my job worth working – getting to work with our student athletes,” Shear said. “That’s what I’m most excited about.”
She said she anticipates some challenges, like booking flights or bus trips for the first time. But she added that she has a strong support system on the coaching staff in assistant coaches Ryan Devlin and Graham Bousley – two former directors of operations.
Christian also connected her with Justine Miller, a director of operations under Christian at Mount St. Mary’s when he helmed the program. Shear said the two talked about Miller’s organizational techniques and how she handled the workload.
Shear said being the only woman in an all-male program is nothing new – she was the only woman in her previous role with the athletic department and one of the few game day media relations staff members for the Capitals.
“But I feel like I’m able to learn a lot from them,” she said. “And then understand the importance of how I can be a role model for all these men around me, but for other women in the industry.”

The tomatoes and chipotle in adobo in the marinade of El Sol's chicken tinga tacos give them a bright red color.
For some of the best Mexican food in the District, El Sol Restaurante & Tequileria should be your go-to spot.
The taqueria, located at 1227 11 St. NW in the heart of Mt. Vernon Square, features an array of Mexican cuisine. With two chefs born and raised in Mexico City, El Sol Restaurante & Tequileria is as authentic as it gets – the restaurant even gets weekly shipments of mole straight from Mexico.
Beyond its food, the restaurant has an incredible drinks selection. Along with a lineup of more than 60 tequilas, you can sip on margaritas ($12) in flavors like mango, tamarind or maracuya or a selection of imported beers ($5.50) like Dos Equis, Corona and Modelo Especial.
If you’re looking for something non-alcoholic, El Sol also offers an assortment of Jarritos sodas ($3), horchata ($3) and Mexican Coke ($3).
Start your meal off with an order of queso fundido ($10) – hot, melted Oaxaca and Chihuahua cheeses topped with chorizo and served with fresh tortillas – or a pile of nachos ($12) to share with the table.
With an expansive menu, it might be hard to decide what to get for your main course. But some of El Sol’s specialties include enchiladas de mole rojo ($13.50), which is stuffed with chicken and cheese and topped with mole sauce, and pozole rojo ($13), a slow-braised pork soup.
I opted for an order of two chicken tinga tacos ($3 each). Each taco came topped with shredded lettuce, crema, a sprinkle of cheese and a slice of lime.
The chicken tinga’s bright red color stood out on the plate, thanks to the tomatoes and chipotle in adobo in the marinade. The chicken was super flavorful – with a bit of smokiness and a mild heat from the chipotles – and was literally dripping with excess marinade. Each taco came layered on two delicate homemade tortillas that helped to soak up the chicken’s marinade, keeping the integrity of the taco.
Each topping helped to balance out the intense flavors of the chicken tinga. The lettuce added crunch and freshness, the sour cream helped to bring down some of the heat and the cheeses added a bit more saltiness. A few squeezes of lime added a subtle, tangy flavor that perfected the overall dish.
Authentic Mexican food in the District is few and far between, but El Sol has got you covered with its huge selection of delicious Mexican fare.

The long-term social-emotional fallout of the COVID-19 closures this past March and subsequent cancellation of activities and events this year is immeasurable. GW’s choice to contribute to that fallout yet again, by denying freshmen the opportunity to live in D.C. for the spring semester, is a mistake.
There is no beating around the bush – most prospective students ultimately choose to enroll as a result of the University’s prime location in the nation’s capital and the internship opportunities in the city. With a major portion of students studying political science or international affairs, the chance to engage in local protests or score a Hillternship contributes to the school’s appeal. Depriving freshmen, many with still undetermined career paths and various academic interests, of these experiences will have long-term effects on the University’s standing.
It is those in-person experiences that attract students to attend GW and that have filled freshmen’s dreams for months. With enrollment numbers already down, it would not be surprising to see a significant group of freshmen withdrawing or transferring this spring. Already one of the nation’s most expensive universities, in large part because of its central location, students simply cannot afford to pay tens of thousands in tuition for a “premium Khan Academy” type experience another semester. Officials have a social responsibility to rethink GW’s closure and allow the Class of 2024 to return to campus this spring.
While officials, faculty and the Student Association have insisted our choice to close was in the best interests of students’ health, they seemingly have forgotten about mental health. We know college students are “prone to feelings of loneliness” and experience higher rates of depression compared to other Americans. Already being vulnerable, even when on an active campus with several social opportunities and access to counseling or other treatment, college students in 2020 live in a dangerous situation. Isolated at home, many with their high school friends departing for college and lacking much communication with their GW peers, freshmen are facing an even greater risk of depression, anxiety or other more serious mental health illnesses. Being on campus would help alleviate some of those issues.
Student morale and academic drive this semester have been low, as I constantly hear from my classmates that they are behind on readings and struggling to motivate themselves to attend class from anywhere but their beds or couches. Digital readings and hours of supplemental videos have become monotonous – I personally have found my eyes strained from spending extensive hours glued to my computer screen for reading assignments. But online learning is not necessarily the only thing hurting our productivity. We lack socialization and the energy of campus that enables students, especially freshmen, to perform their best. Freshmen lean on their peers to get accustomed to the pace of student life, and we need to be in person to experience that.
The Class of 2024 needs to find community. We need to build personal and professional bonds with our professors and administrators. And we need to see the full breadth of the University’s hundreds of student organizations firsthand. Freshmen are in a unique situation in that they are missing out on everything – they didn’t even get a taste of campus and don’t fully know whether GW is the right fit for them. We need to have some semblance of campus life to ensure we stay at the University for the next four years.
A number of GW’s peer institutions, like New York and Vanderbilt universities, have successfully reopened this fall with a miniscule number of cases. These schools, rather than concede in the face of difficulties, have risen to the occasion and formulated solutions to give their freshmen the college experience they promised — a mantra one would expect GW to share considering its fierce political activist mentality. With weekly testing, quarantines upon arrival, contact tracing and isolation of infected students, GW’s peers have worked through a difficult time while caring for the greater social emotional well-being of their students. GW students know the health risks of the pandemic and deserve to live in Foggy Bottom while abiding by COVID-19 guidelines.
Administrators owe students what they sold through endless admissions events, social media posts and spam emails: A world-class education at the heart of America’s political epicenter. Whether that education be fully virtual or with hybrid classes, it ought to be on campus for the best interest of freshmen’s well-being and personal growth.

Philip Wirtz is a professor of decision sciences and of psychological and brain sciences and a faculty senator for the GW School of Business. Sarah Wagner is an associate professor of anthropology and a faculty senator for the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. Both are members of the Faculty Senate Committee on Appointment, Salary and Promotion Policies.
Last Friday, the Faculty Senate voted to express “severe disapproval” – rather than censure – of University President Thomas LeBlanc’s decision to hire Heather Swain as GW’s vice president for communication and marketing. Swain withdrew her acceptance of the offer after widespread criticism over her role in the follow-up investigation of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case. President LeBlanc subsequently sent an email to the GW community in which he apologized “for the distress and distraction that this has caused many in our community.” He noted that “I should have recognized the sensitivities and implications of this hire.”
Prior to last Friday’s meeting, the senate commissioned the Senate Appointment, Salary and Promotion Policies Standing Committee to meet with President LeBlanc in confidence to hear his account of the events, timeline and decision-making process that led to Swain’s hire. After fully reviewing these factors in confidence with President LeBlanc, the committee recommended, without dissent, that the senate censure the GW president over the matter. We are two members of the committee and of the senate who dissented from the senate’s decision NOT to follow ASPP’s recommendation. We think the decision to use a term other than “censure” not only weakened the message sent by senators to President LeBlanc but also sent an unfortunate message to the University community and administration.
As correctly reported by The Hatchet, one reason offered during the senate debate for the change in wording was “because [President] LeBlanc provided a full accounting of the Swain hiring process and proposed changes for administrators to vet candidates in the future.” But the logic behind this assertion is problematic: It seems to suggest that, no matter how egregious the behavior, “censure” is  inappropriate as long as the individual takes responsibility, apologizes and puts in place provisions which minimize the probability of recurrence. Apart from the fact that (a) the “full accounting” occurred under strict confidence with a committee that included a number of faculty senators, and (b) the new hiring protocol came at the senate’s – not the president’s – request, the assertion signals that the senate will limit sanction about any future misdeeds as long as an offender apologizes and takes steps to minimize recurrence of the behavior. In our view, the degree to which bad judgment was exercised needs to be factored into the severity of the sanction. Knowing the details of the events, timeline and decision-making processes, the ASPP committee determined – after “extensive” deliberation, as reported by ASPP to the senate – that “censure” was the correct word  to apply in this case.
The Hatchet article also correctly notes that there was some wariness about censuring the president because the “trustees did not want faculty to censure [President] LeBlanc, preferring that senators voice strong disapproval of the hiring instead,” and that “maintaining a dialogue with trustees and administrators, rather than voting to censure, will enable senators to advocate for faculty more  successfully.”  From our perspective, the senate needs to be entirely independent of the Board of Trustees. The senate should not be taking positions out of fear that the Board will no longer maintain a dialog with it. To us, that sounds like extortion. Furthermore, privileging the trustees’ interests over those of our colleagues, who elected us to represent them in the senate, undermines not only our ability to engage in shared governance but our standing to do so.
A third reason correctly cited in The Hatchet article for reluctance by the senate to censure President LeBlanc is that it might “impair the senate’s ability to practice shared governance with administrators in the future.” Again, to us, this sounds as if the senate is running away from its responsibilities as the independent unit which speaks truth, even if that truth might not be something the administration wishes to hear.
The Faculty Senate has for many years set the standard for independent expression. To us, last Friday’s failure by the senate to approve a resolution of censure represents an unfortunate departure from that standard. We hope that the senate will soon return to the standards which, in our  view, it failed to meet last Friday.

LeBlanc said universities will need to rethink revenue streams so that enrollment and tuition are no longer the lifeblood of colleges in the future, which he said is currently a “broken business model of higher education.”
University President Thomas LeBlanc joined a virtual panel of college presidents Wednesday on the disruption of higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Milken Institute – a nonpartisan economic think tank – hosted a virtual event titled “Ten Years in Ten Months: Accelerating the Disruption of Higher Education.” LeBlanc joined three other university presidents who shared their views on the short-term needs of higher education in the midst of the pandemic as well as the long-term risks and prospective opportunities.
Jeffrey Selingo, an author and journalist specializing in higher education, moderated the discussion.
Arizona State University President Michael Crow said to make remote learning more personable, colleges can employ four strategies – have faculty present their own intellectual material, make available as much human interaction as possible, use technology to allow people to form learning communities and bring an emotional connection to the classroom.
“Online doesn’t mean devoid of human contact,” Crow said. “It means available in a certain modality.”
LeBlanc spoke on the implications of the divergence from place-dependent education. Officials have worked to virtually replicate the advantages of being in D.C. and “Only at GW” experiences, he said.
“One of the things this will force us to do is to think very carefully about how to take advantage of being in the city and how to take advantage of the virtual world as well so we get the best of both worlds,” LeBlanc said.
LeBlanc said universities will need to rethink revenue streams so that enrollment and tuition are no longer the lifeblood of colleges in the future, which he said is currently a “broken business model of higher education.”
“Certainly here at GW we are looking at all possible opportunities for revenue, even with continuing education,” he said. “That is another form of tuition. So the idea that tuition won’t be a lifeblood, that’s probably a long way off.”
LeBlanc also referenced officials’ decision to reduce tuition by 10 percent for undergraduates not returning to campus during online instruction. He said the decision was not “entirely scientific” but represented a fair response to promote affordability.
LeBlanc said the University had many online programs prior to the pandemic, which were priced comparably to current virtual instruction.
Carol Christ, the chancellor for University of California, Berkeley, said the notion of “place elasticity” – the idea that people do not need to be in the same location for their entire undergraduate career –  will likely continue in post-pandemic higher education.
Panelists also discussed topics like the role of universities in racial and socioeconomic injustices, as well as needed systematic change. Michael Sorrell, the president of Paul Quinn College, said universities are an active part of promoting societal change.
“We in higher education, and education in general, are going to need to take a more active role in repairing our democracy and repairing this idea of our societal tone and the common good,” Sorrell said. “I think it’s going to be interesting, as the institutions evolve, to see how we accomplish that because the way we are functioning now in society is not sustainable.”

Matthew said officials have held two “pop-up” discussions that focus on current issues like the legal implications of the grand jury’s decision in the case of Breonna Taylor.
After passing an anti-racism resolution this summer, GW Law officials said they have diversified course readings, encouraged faculty to attend bias training and held discussions on racial justice issues for GW community members.
The resolution included initiatives to increase the number of non-White faculty and staff at the law school, improve efforts to recruit students of color and implement workshops on race-sensitive teaching. Law school Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew said her office has been working with students, faculty and staff to address the initiatives from the resolution through speaking events and fundraising efforts for social justice organizations.
Matthew said officials implemented a speaker series on racial injustice for law school members called “Visions of Change” as a “scholarly discourse” on the role of race in health care, criminal law, commercial law and civil justice. She said officials have held two “pop-up” discussions that focus on current issues like the legal implications of the grand jury’s decision in the case of Breonna Taylor.
“The resolution reaches every aspect of our academic, intellectual and professional mission, and we are identifying immediate, medium- and long-term actions for implementing the resolution,” Matthew said in an email.
She said her office is raising funds to establish a national institute of racial and socioeconomic equity; Power Reimagined, an institute for women, race and law; and a health justice initiative. Matthew said officials are working to establish a “new point of contact” in her office for matters of diversity, equity and inclusion.
Matthew said “numerous” faculty have begun revising their syllabi and “pedagogical approaches” to accomplish the initiatives in the resolution, adding that her office is working with a teaching committee to explore further ways to support those efforts.
“Moreover, several faculty members have proposed new courses that will squarely address issues of race in America, and the Dean’s Office is prioritizing such courses as it evaluates the law school’s academic offerings going forward,” she said.
She said the law school’s Career Center, Dean of Students Office and admissions office are working to ensure the school’s incoming classes are “as diverse as possible” and those students are supported and able to successfully launch their careers. She did not specify how the offices are trying to diversify future classes.
Matthew said her office is planning an “administrative role” to lead the law school’s diversity and inclusion responsibilities and will announce the details about this role by early 2021. She said this role is a “priority” even in light of the University’s budget shortfall.
“The law school is proud that the faculty unanimously adopted an anti-racism resolution on June 19, 2020, and since that time students, faculty and staff have been eager to pursue actions that will follow through on that commitment,” Matthew said.
She declined to say if officials have plans to expand the efforts listed in the resolution.
Sonia Suter, a research professor of law, said she and 10 other law professors helped create the resolution following a letter signed by more than 50 faculty members condemning Attorney General William Barr as not abiding by the basic values of the law school.
Suter said faculty saw there was a “larger issue” of racial justice that “transcended” Barr’s actions, which she said motivated them to draft and pass the resolution.
She said law school officials are hosting a series of discussions on racial justice and encouraging students and faculty to undergo bias trainings. She said in light of the hiring freeze administrators implemented in March to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, officials have not been able to make progress in hiring more people of color in the school.
The resolution stated that officials will work with the Black Law Students Association to implement the school’s goals. Suter said faculty want to encourage BLSA to engage and collaborate with them on these issues but don’t want students in BLSA “to feel like it’s their job” to work on these issues.
“We were trying to strike a really fine line between making it clear we were interested in the views of student organizations generally, but especially student organizations who are impacted by racism, and making it clear we didn’t want to expect BLSA and other groups to hold our hands and take us through this process,” she said.
BLSA members said the resolution assured Black students that law school officials were listening and willing to work with BLSA on their concerns but said the resolution lacked action items and “concrete” steps to move forward.
Jordan Jean, a social action chair of BLSA, said members of BLSA’s executive board met with Emily Hammond, the law school’s senior associate dean for academic affairs, last week to discuss how the initiatives were being implemented and set up a monthly check-in meeting.
Jean said the resolution was a step in the right direction, but “it’s not the ceiling, it’s the floor.” He said BLSA will continue to assess the progress of the resolution as the year progresses, and he wants to see faculty pass another resolution with concrete steps that he said were lacking from the original resolution.
He added that officials gave “some type of inclination” that they heard BLSA’s frustrations and desire for transparency in implementing anti-racism initiatives.
“Dean Matthew at the helm of this thing will ensure that the law school becomes a place of diversity of thought, learning and that African-American students and people of the Black diaspora feel welcome and feel heard,” he said.
Katrina Jackson, another social action chair of BLSA, said BLSA will be able to “apply pressure and accountability” to law school officials through their scheduled monthly meetings.
“While we are optimistic, we are realistic in the sense that a lot of students of color have been told things, have been fed the diversity and inclusion line their whole academic career, and some have seen it and some have not,” she said.
Jackson said BLSA declined to sign on to the original resolution because it lacked “actionable items.”
BLSA launched a petition in July calling for equity and institutional change at the law school, which Jackson said was not connected to the resolution that faculty passed. She said officials were “open and welcoming” to conversations about the petition.
“Given a variety of factors, certain things are going to take some time right now,” she said. “Personally, I think it’s too soon to say how committed the law school is in ensuring a race-conscious and unbiased environment.”

Harnett said the two projects will help rectify safety on roadways throughout Foggy Bottom during a time when traffic fatalities continue to bubble throughout the District.
Before the month is over, a newly constructed protected bike lane and an additional Capital Bikeshare station will be added to the G Street corridor in Foggy Bottom.
Senior James Harnett, the chair of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, said city officials are installing a two-way protected bike lane that will cut through the heart of campus and connect Virginia Avenue to the White House, where the lane starts and finishes. Harnett said G Street will also receive a new Capital Bikeshare station with 15 to 20 new bike slots at the corner of 21st and G Street, the sixth such station on campus.
The construction of the G Street bike lane, a process that started Sept. 30 and is set to conclude Oct. 24, is the second bike lane construction project to kick off in Foggy Bottom this month. Harnett said officials started work on the 20th and 21st street lanes earlier this week, which will run north and south through campus, connecting Dupont Circle to the National Mall.
Harnett said the two projects will help rectify safety on roadways throughout Foggy Bottom during a time when traffic fatalities continue to bubble throughout the District.
“Those two bike lanes are going to provide the necessary access, the necessary safe access for students to feel like they can get on a bike, get around campus, get around the city and their life isn’t in imminent danger,” Harnett said.
Harnett said the G Street bike lane measures 12 feet wide to allow cyclists 6 feet of space when they’re biking in each direction – a feature that exceeds the city’s 8 feet minimum width requirement. He said white bollards, short plastic posts, will line the lane, and concrete slabs will shield every other post to add another layer of protection for commuters in the bike lane.
Harnett said city officials are also decking G Street with parking signs and traffic signals to alert drivers of the new lane and where they can move on the road. Although officials needed to remove more than 120 parking spaces from the south side of the street, Harnett said the north side of the road allows community members to split space between bikers and drivers, who he said will still have room to park and drive through Foggy Bottom.
“We are alright with removing parking, and I made clear that the priority needs to be on cyclist safety and the need to store privately owned vehicles on public space had to be and was the lowest priority in terms of our design of this project,” he said.
Harnett said the city’s initial bike lane proposal in the 2005 D.C. Bicycle Master Plan, which proposes one-way lanes on G and F streets while maintaining parking, would have narrowed streets usually congested with commercial vehicles heading to local buildings and would have confused bikers about the lane’s traffic direction. The ANC passed a resolution last year requesting the District Department of Transportation rework its plans to construct a two-way lane on G Street.
“We were pushing back against the plan they had because we thought we had a better one and one that actually provided better connectivity, better safety and a better network, and once they recognized that, we were off to the races,” Harnett said. “And it came down to me just sitting down with folks and talking about block by block, how this was a better plan.”

A student was arrested last Thursday after he allegedly attempted to rape two women in a pair of incidents last week.
Kendrie Roberts-Monticue, a senior from Reston, Virginia, is accused of attempting to rape a mother in front of her child aboard a Metro train last Monday and another woman in a Reston apartment building a day later. Roberts-Monticue was arrested by Metro Transit Police Department officers at a family member’s home in Virginia Thursday, according to a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority press release.
“We are pleased to see a quick arrest in this case, thanks to tips from the public,” WMATA spokesperson Sherri Ly said in an email.
A Fairfax County Police Department release states Roberts-Monticue is charged with attempted rape and abduction with an intent to defile in connection to the incident in Reston. He’s expected to be charged with both attempted rape by force, threat or intimidation and attempted sodomy by force, threat or intimidation in connection to the event on the Metro, WMATA’s release states.
“The University is aware that a student who is currently enrolled was recently arrested for multiple offenses,” University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said in an email. “The Title IX Office will continue to closely review the available information and take action in support of the safety and wellbeing of the GW community.”
Roberts-Monticue did not return a request for comment.
Roberts-Monticue boarded a Silver Line Metro train last Monday at the Wiehle-Reston East station, attempting to take off a woman’s clothes and exposing himself to the woman and her young child, according to a WMATA release after the incident. The release states the felony occurred at about 11:35 a.m. between McLean and East Falls Church, where the woman escaped the train and MTPD officers responded.
No witnesses were in the Metro car besides the victim’s child, and Roberts-Monticue exited the train at the Foggy Bottom station, according to the release.
The following morning, Roberts-Monticue “grabbed and attempted to sexually assault” a woman working inside an apartment building on the 11000 block of Reston Station Boulevard, according to the FCPD release. Roberts-Monticue ran away from the scene after the woman was able to “fight him off,” the release states.
The release states officers arrived at the building before 8:00 a.m. in response to a report of an abduction, and detectives “worked through the night” to identify and locate Roberts-Monticue.
FCPD sergeant Hudson Bull said joint efforts between MTPD and FCPD helped police arrest Roberts-Monticue to ensure the public felt safe within “a pretty quick manner of time.”
“This case demonstrates the teamwork and the cooperation of the law enforcement agencies in this area, particularly the Fairfax County Police Department and the Metro Transit Police Department, whose detectives worked through the night nonstop once they got the information on the suspect to locate him and justify charges and arrest him,” he said in an interview.
Roberts-Monticue is being held without bond at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center and is in contact with the department’s Major Crimes Bureau’s Victim Services Division, which provides inmates “appropriate resources and assistance,” FCPD’s release states.

A student launched a petition last week calling for officials to cancel synchronous classes on Election Day to encourage community members to take part in the political process.
The petition, which has attained more than 850 signatures as of Tuesday, states that holding synchronous classes on Nov. 3 is an “impediment to necessary civic participation” of students, faculty and other members of the GW community. University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said Provost Brian Blake is encouraging faculty to be “flexible” on Election Day to allow students to vote.
The petition cites American University’s decision last week to cancel classes for the election this year and during all future presidential elections as an example GW should follow.
“Canceling synchronous classes on Election Day like our neighbor – American University – recently did will not only make it easier to participate in our democracy, but it also can lead to an increase in turnout by eliminating scheduling conflicts for both students and faculty,” the petition states.
The petition mentions a 2018 report from the Pew Research Center that states that two-thirds of Americans are in favor of making Election Day a holiday and 2016 U.S. Census data that shows that scheduling conflicts were among the top reasons for why eligible voters chose not to vote.
“Regardless of who they are, every eligible member of the GW community deserves the opportunity to fully participate on Election Day, and canceling classes that day – this year and for future elections – is the most effective way to make that opportunity truly accessible,” the petition states.
Maria Leon-Acosta, the student who started the petition, said holding synchronous classes on Election Day hinders the GW community’s ability to “fully participate” in the election.
“This election – regardless of where one stands – is one of the most contentious of our lifetimes, and even with voting being conducted at least partially by mail, others may opt to vote in person, work the polls and/or spend the day volunteering for their preferred campaign(s),” Leon-Acosta said in an email.
She said all members of the GW community deserve the opportunity to “equitably participate” in the election this year.
“Moreover, GW consistently prides itself in the civic and political engagement of its students and community – giving students and faculty the day off on Election Day is the logical choice to live up to that claim and to further encourage our community’s continued participation in those types of initiatives,” Leon-Acosta said.
She said the petition has had a “warm reception” from the GW community since it was launched last week and said she hopes officials respond favorably.
“That said, encouraging professors to merely give flexibility to students is not enough – it gives them the opportunity to still deny that flexibility, and it ignores the fact that faculty members and staff should also be able to have time off on Election Day,” Leon-Acosta said.
