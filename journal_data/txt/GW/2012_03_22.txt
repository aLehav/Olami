When most college students crave ramen noodles, they think of Styrofoam cups, sodium-packed yellow broth and peas and carrots that taste like cardboard.
These cups are fine for a late night study snack, but you can find a more authentic version at Toki Underground, a Taiwanese noodle spot in Northeast.
Toki Underground is hip. The restaurant is tiny, with seating for no more than 20 people. But what it lacks in size, it makes up for in style. Tables line the walls, and patrons sit bar-style and rest their feet on old skateboards. Other surfaces are decorated with Asian street art or jars of Asian spices, and hip-hop music easily fills the small space. The atmosphere is geared toward a young, adventurous crowd and complements the trendy yet traditional Asian cuisine.
Though best known for its noodles, Toki is also highly praised for its dumplings. The menu offers five different types of dumplings, which come fried, pan-fried or steamed. My friend and I each got an order, hers steamed pork and mine pan-fried seafood. Maybe it was the hype, but neither of us was too impressed. Despite having a decent texture and coming with a delicious Japanese barbeque dipping sauce, both varieties lacked overall flavor. At $5 for 6 dumplings, the upside was the reasonable pricing.
We also ordered a side of kimchi, a Korean pickled cabbage dish for $2. I thought it was tasty— sweet and not too spicy — but my friend was not a fan.
The noodles themselves were a different story. I ordered the Thursday special, Taiwanese-style beef noodles for $12. The bowls are enormous for such a decent price, as one could easily feed two people. The best part of my dish was the beef, braised and wonderfully tender. The broth and additional toppings were delicious, with baby bok choy, scallions and surprisingly appealing pickled mustard greens. The overall effect was seamlessly tangy and salty, with a great texture and depth of flavor.
My friend’s $10 Toki Hakata Classic had a slightly salty broth, but it was rich and satisfying when eaten with pork loin chashu and noodles. The noodles in both dishes were thin and perfectly cooked, serving as a great base for the unique and often contrasting flavors.
For dessert, we got the special – coconut sorbetto with smoked sea salt and shortbread cookies, for $3. Though small in size, the sorbetto was creamy and fresh, and the cookies were a crunchy bonus.
We also tried the Warm Cookies for $7, which turned out to be Chinese almond cookies served with a glass of cold milk. They were, as promised, fresh-from-the-oven warm. The flaky, chewy and buttery cookies proved a delightfully sweet end to a savory and flavorful meal. By the time we left at around 7 p.m., the line to get a seat was out the door.
Overall, the restaurant was solid. The appetizers were mediocre at best, but the noodles and the desserts were well worth the 50-minute bus ride to the other side of the city. So next time you reach for your Ramen, shut the microwave door, grab a friend and venture over to Toki Underground for great noodles that come in a bowl bigger than your head – not a Styrofoam cup.

It started 20 years ago as a relatively small showcase, but it lives on today as the nation’s largest celebration of environmental film.
Seeking to advance environmental causes through film, The Environmental Film Festival offers viewers the chance to witness a desire for change on screen through videos shot around the world.
This year’s event is the most ambitious project in the festival’s history, showcasing 180 different films in 64 venues across the city from March 13 to 25.
The environmental event began in 1993, founded by Flo Stone, who recognized the potential for environmental awareness in the still-emerging field of documentary filmmaking.
“People have become more concerned about the environment, and documentary films have become more prevalent and better,” Helen Strong, public affairs director of the festival, said. “These two trends have helped the festival grow and prosper.”
Last year the festival attracted more than 30,000 people to screenings across the city.
Strong said the stature of the festival has grown because of the types of films the festival showcases features stories to engage a varied audience.
“Most of the films we show are not overtly political. They address issues across the globe and frequently show the effects of environmental developments on ordinary people,” Strong said.
Senior Natalie Kornicks and junior Jon Fenech produced a short film, “Coffee in Crisis,” examining whether depleting coffee crops could be linked to climate change, something the duo took a look at both globally and within their local community.
“I think the film can advance environmental causes by showing that climate change is not as distant as most people think,” Kornicks said. “By putting climate change in terms most people understand, coffee, it is easier to grasp the concept and understand the consequences.”
The film was made as part of an SMPA class, linked to the environmental non-profit Planet Forward, in which students produced environmental or sustainability themed video pieces examining problems related to climate change, bio fuels and green business.
With “The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom,” a 2012 Academy Award nominee for short documentary film, director Lucy Walker originally intended to create what she calls a “visual haiku about cherry blossoms,” but the tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 led her to film a visual poem about the cherry blossom as a symbol of life and hope. It received the festival’s Polly Krakora Award for Artistry in Film.
“Symphony of the Soil,” opening on March 25, combines ancient knowledge and cutting-edge research into a narrative that explores exactly how important soil is to our planet.

Fresh from wrist surgery, senior pitcher Kara Clauss said it was a strong drive that helped her throw the second no-hitter in program history in the Colonials’ 3-0 victory over Mount Saint Mary’s March 13.
Pitching a no-hitter, a significant accomplishment for any pitcher, was especially rewarding for the senior, who took to the mound this season intending for her performance to establish a successful return.
“I’m a big believer in letting my actions speak louder than my words,” Clauss said. “I really try to push myself.”
She underwent surgery in January after a cyst developed on her right wrist, her pitching arm. Unable to perform her normal training drills, Clauss focused on cardio conditioning, which weakened the cartiledge in her right ankle, putting the pitcher in a boot for six weeks. She returned fully from both injuries just a few weeks before the season began.
At first, Clauss said she expected to start the season performing at her personal peak, but returning from the surgery and its complications was more challenging than anticipated. She focused on rehabilitation exercises that slowly increased the pace and force of her throws, and estimates her performance was at about 80 percent of her potential power as play opened.
But Clauss continued to push herself in practice, determined to return to the level of play she brought to the field before injury. It paid off– GW picked up its first win of the season March 3, defeating Robert Morris with Clauss on the mound for seven innings of one-run ball.
“I know that I need to help our team out and be a dominating part of our pitching staff,” Clauss said. “I knew that I needed to come back and work even harder in practice and work to get to where I was at the end of last season.”
Her passion for the game doesn’t go unnoticed by Clauss’ teammates. She was nominated by the rest of the Colonials to serve as the only captain this season, and she is vocal about her desire to motivate her teammates through her actions.
Head coach Stacey Schramm said Clauss expects more out of her teammates than they expect out of themselves – a leadership quality that pushes the entire roster on the field.
“When she stands on the mound, the team is just very comfortable. She doesn’t even realize the impact that she has on her teammates,” Schramm said.
Clauss pitched her fourth shutout of the season against Hampton Tuesday, allowing five hits and walking none in GW’s 3-0 victory in game one of a doubleheader. While she is playing, Clauss said she focuses only on the game, shutting out all other distractions.
She doesn’t shake her intense focus for anything, even an outstanding performance. During her no-hitter, Clauss didn’t know what she had accomplished until after the game
“I normally don’t like to know that type of thing until after the game, because it puts added pressure to make sure I finish the game properly,” she said.
When Clauss graduates this spring, she’ll leave as a standout performer for the Colonials, one whose roster spot Schramm said will not be easy to fill.
The loss of Clauss’ leadership skills will be felt just as deeply, the head coach said. If it were possible, Schramm added, she would keep the senior on GW’s roster for much longer.
“That’s going to be tough for her to leave,” Schramm said. “There will be a big question mark as far as who’s going to replace her.”

Students nationwide signed more than 130,000 letters to four Congressional leaders last week to protest the higher interest rates set to take effect in July on some student loans.
Subsidized Stafford loans – interest rates for which will double to 6.8 percent without Congressional action – provided about 4,700 undergraduate GW students with more than $30 million in education funding this year. The average subsidized loan award was $4,760 in 2011, data from the U.S. Department of Education show.
“Today student voices will be heard loud and clear by delivering over 130,000 letters to leaders in Congress. Our message is simple: Don’t double student debt rates,” said Rich Williams, a higher education advocate with the United States Public Interest Research Group. “Rising college costs, tight family finances and uncertain job prospects pack a triple whammy for student borrowers. In this economy, the last thing we should do is double the interest rates on student loans.”
In 2010, the average debt of GW graduates was more than $32,500, significantly higher than the national average, according to the Project on Student Debt’s latest information.
“Congress has effectively been paralyzed so there is a risk that, due to lack of momentum in Congress, interest rates could end up doubling. So that is why it is important that we are out there banging the drums on this issue and showing and reminding lawmakers that people actually care,” Williams said.
Associate Vice President for Financial Assistance Dan Small declined to say if he expected the petition to trigger Congressional action, but said GW will work to notify students once a final decision is made.
“We will have to wait until the debate has been finalized and Congress has made a decision,” Small said.
The current interest rate is the result of federal legislation passed in 2007, which set out to halve the 6.8 percent fee over four years. Without a move by Congress, the interest rates will return to their pre-recession 6.8 percent July 1.
Under the planned changes, almost 8 million students nationwide will have to pay an average of $2,800 more in student loan debt over a 10-year repayment term, Williams said. The bump in interest fees tied to the loans carry heavy consequences, he warned.
“Buying a home, getting married, starting a family – all of those major decisions might be postponed because of the quantity of debt a graduate has,” he said.
Small said he had not heard concerns from GW students but emphasized that the University will not react until a federal choice is handed down.
“I’m sure some are upset, but probably know it is out of GW hands,” he said.
Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the Congressional leaders to whom the letters were addressed, did not return requests for comment.

Marilyn Chavannes hadn’t always wanted to be a family doctor, especially with most of her classmates in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences eyeing specialty fields like internal medicine and pediatrics.
But after the fourth-year graduate student took a medical mission trip to her native Haiti during her first year at the medical school, she was hooked into the generalized field of family medicine.
“I saw how a family medicine doctor was able to take care of anybody. The pediatrician could only have kids in his line,” Chavannes, who will perform her residency in a hospital in southwestern Georgia, said. “Getting to see the benefits of family medicine was a big deal to me.”
Last Friday’s residency Match Day for fourth-year medical students revealed which fields future doctors are choosing, and Chavannes is part of a small but growing contingent of medical students at GW and nationwide who are opting to do their three-year residency in family medicine – a placement that often means lower pay and less prestige.


Now with 12 students matching into family medicine residencies at GW, double the total from last year, more students are trying to shed the stereotypes of family physicians as the “jack of all trades, master of none,” fourth-year medical student David Goodman said.
On Match Day, an annual cathartic event for medical students across the nation, 172 medical students crammed into Ross Hall to tear open envelopes revealing where they were accepted to do their residencies.
This past academic year, students have traveled the country, interviewing with potential hospitals and medical centers that they hoped would be their homes for the next three to seven years. Students and directors at American teaching hospitals each list their preferences for residency matches, which are filtered through a computer algorithm run by the National Resident Matching Program.
“I think a lot of us were more anxious than we thought we’d be,” Goodman said. “I just kind of walked in there and thought, ‘Do I really want 200 other people around me when I’m doing this?’ But when it happens, there’s a lot of happiness.”
In residency assignments spanning from Seattle to Albany, Ga., budding family physicians will be trained to handle a wide range of cases and treat both adults and children instead of specializing in one area or age group. Family doctors serve more rural and poor communities than any other medical specialty, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Although the 12 GW students who matched into family medicine represent only 7 percent of the class, the growth is surprising in a medical school without a department of family medicine, the medical schools’ senior associate dean for academic affairs Scott Schroth said.
“In D.C., where there’s a [specialty] physician on any street corner, family physicians haven’t historically had a big presence,” Schroth said.
After a decades-long slide nationally in the number of family doctors, the rise in students taking up family medicine residencies at GW mirrors a three-year upward trend across the country, said Wendy Biggs, the assistant director of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
According to the National Resident Matching Program, about 48 percent of the vacancies in family residency programs in the U.S. were filled this year, the highest rate in the last five years.
“It is becoming more widely recognized that family medicine is the foundation of a strong healthcare system,” Biggs said, citing studies that show communities with strong family doctors save costs by avoiding emergency room visits.
The lower earning potential of family doctors can turn off medical students, many of whom face student loan debt after graduation. According to an annual survey of physicians’ salaries, family doctors earned an average base salary of $189,000 in 2010, dwarfed by specialists like anesthesiologists who earned $344,000 on average.
Goodman said he gravitated toward family medicine after interning with family physicians and enjoying the smaller program sizes.
“I took a month or two months to do a rotation with family medicine, and they knew what they were doing and when to ask for help,” Goodman said.

The D.C. Council gave a green light to new boundaries for the city’s most localized districts Tuesday, moving closer to finalizing a yearlong redrawing process that will add two new representatives to Foggy Bottom’s flagship neighborhood group.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission – the community’s top advocacy group that serves as a liaison to District agencies on matters including traffic, safety, land use planning and liquor licenses – will not see changes to its outer boundary lines but the reshuffling plan breaks up its single-member districts to create two new subdivisions, forming eight total commissioner spots.
Single-member districts, each represented by a commissioner, split wards into smaller, individual constituencies.
The maps must receive a second approval from the council next month, offering time for technical changes like fine-tuning descriptions of each border.
The two-year nonpartisan posts are unpaid. Elections for the two new commissioners will be held Nov. 6.
Commissioners must reside in an address within the single-member district they represent. Students will be the only residents in a new single-member district along the eastern edge of campus and bordered by Pennsylvania Avenue – meaning a student will likely hold the commissioner seat. ANC 3D, which American University falls under, will also see an all-student single member district.
City officials are reviewing adjustments to the boundaries for its nearly 40 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions after completing the redistricting process for D.C.’s eight wards last summer. Andrew Huff, director of communications for Ward 2 D.C. Council member Jack Evans – who co-chaired the council’s subcommittee on redistricting – called the process a “mixed bag.”
“There are places where some ANCs are gaining commissioners and some are losing commissioners. There are some brand new ANCs,” he said.
Realignments began after 2010 census data revealed a 5.2 percent hike in the District’s population over the previous decade, growing from 572,059 people to 601,723.
The census tallied college students as D.C. residents for the first time that year, rather than counting students under their home states. Ward 2, where GW sits, reached 79,915 people in a 16 percent boost – the largest jump in population among all of D.C.’s eight wards.
Students at the University make up about 39 percent of Foggy Bottom and the West End’s population, according to the redistricting task force’s final report.
Alumnus and commissioner Asher Corson, who was elected to the ANC during his senior year in 2006, said he does not think a student representative would dramatically change the dynamic of the group. Corson also worked on the redistricting task force.
“Anyone that lives in the [single-member district] and qualifies can run: professors, students, anybody,” he said. “It is my sincere belief that the more students are involved in groups like the ANC, those students will realize that their interests are well-aligned with the rest of the community.”
Assistant Vice President for Government and Community Relations Renee McPhatter said the University has a good working relationship with the ANC.
“GW was represented on the sub-committee, comprised of community stakeholders and ANC commissioners that worked on the re-districting for ANC 2A,” she said.

Administrators will trek more than 7,000 miles next month to tout the University among students in Arab states, an effort to further diversify an international student population that is currently dominated by a handful of Asian countries.
Admissions officials will embark on a recruiting trip in mid-April to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey to draw in more undergraduate and graduate applicants.
The two-and-a-half week trip is a continuation of a 2010 diversity effort launched by the admissions office, which sent officers to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Egypt. This visit marks admissions officials’ second trip to the region since Sept. 11 after returning to hands-on outreach programs in the region two years ago.
“We are a global University in the center of the world [and] the center of the United States. There is a desire and a need, and it just makes good sense to have a very diverse international and domestic population,” Associate Vice President and Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Kathryn Napper said.
Universities nationwide moved to increase their international student bodies with the onset of the recession, a shift experts noted would boost revenue because these students are not eligible for federal financial aid. Napper said GW’s recruitment abroad is not financially motivated.
Slavko Bradic, GW’s director of international recruitment, said these three countries were chosen because of growing interest from students and to foster diversity among the international student population.
Total enrollment – including graduate, undergraduate and non-degree seeking students – from Saudi Arabia has crept up in the past five years, climbing by 29 percent to reach 98 students last fall. The kingdom is home to the fourth highest population of international students, far behind China, South Korea and India.
Enrollment from the UAE over the last five years has been relatively stable, varying by only a handful of students, while the Turkish student population has dropped off by about one-fifth over the same period, according to internal data. This year, a total of 59 students hail from Turkey.
Bradic will join Napper and one graduate admissions officer to visit international high schools, speak to school officials and students, meet with alumni and promote the University with international admissions organizations like Education USA – a State Department office that encourages foreign students to study in America.
The administrators’ trip will include 12-hour days of non-stop recruiting, as well as private lunches with guidance counselors and alumni. Much of the recruitment will occur in international American- and British-style high schools, Napper said, as their international attendees are often already familiar with the American academic structure and necessary admissions exams.
The GW representatives will also attend the International Exhibition & Conference on Higher Education in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as one of more than 400 universities from around the world, just 72 of which are from the U.S.
“It’s very rewarding, because they’re anxious to make a connection to the individuals who represent whatever countries they’re looking to go to school in,” Napper said.
She added that GW already attracts applicants from the Middle East and Turkey, but said this trip provides an opportunity to build relationships that will expand the University’s international reputation, a goal in line with the forthcoming 10-year strategic plan.
Grabbing the attention of international students can be difficult because it requires first convincing them to study in the U.S. and then encouraging them to apply specifically to GW, Napper said. While marketing the University abroad is similar to domestic recruitment, she said business and engineering programs tend to be high selling points among international applicants.
Selin Habbab, a Turkish national who graduated from the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences in 2000 and remains active with the local alumni chapter, said that international students seek foreign schools with strong reputations and prestigious faculty.
“Tuition and housing, of course, are important factors for all students coming from abroad, but more than that, the level of education, the vision of the school and how students benefit from the college once in the real world,” Habbab said.
Habbab added that GW facilitates the transition for international students by hosting multicultural programming.
“It is always a good feeling that your school does acknowledge your culture,” Habbab said.
John Evans, president of the Overseas Association for College Admission Counseling, said that cultural standards often determine the priorities of international students applying to American colleges.
“Cultural norms more than political institutions influence decisions by students and their families towards Western cultures and university opportunities,” Evans said, noting that prospective students’ cultural and religious lifestyles impact where they apply.
This trip follows a trip by Knapp and several administrators to Oman in January – “part of GW’s ongoing efforts to build strong ties with Oman, as well as the broader Middle East,” University spokeswoman Candace Smith said.

When the dust settled after the spring 2011 season, the women’s club rugby team was without a coaching staff and down 18 players.
The Colonials graduated 14 seniors, and saw four other players depart for personal reasons. Their four-year head coaches, Kenny and Apryl Pope, departed after completing their graduate degrees to rejoin family in Ohio.
But the squad that had advanced to the Elite 8 of the USA Rugby Division II Championship last April wasn’t shaken by the change. Using their considerable success to help recruit, the women’s rugby team found new coaches and began to rebuild the program.
“We decided to heavily recruit in the fall and go for a training regimen that allowed rookies to get a basic grasp of the game,” team president senior Jaime Albarelli said.
The roster overhaul was a massive change for a squad that went undefeated in fall 2010, sweeping its opponents in the Potomac Rugby Union and qualifying for play in Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union. There, the Colonials finished second in spring 2011, ultimately advancing to the Elite 8 of the USA Rugby Division II Championship. After the completion of the entire 2010-2011 season, GW earned a sixth-place ranking nationally from Rugbymag.com.
After the turnover, the women’s rugby team was left with 13 members – two shy of fielding a full team. Undaunted, the Colonials found two new coaches, graduate student Winnie Chao and alumna Suzanne Haggerty, additions who offered vital motivation for the club team as it regained strength.
“Suzanne played with us for two years, so she knows our system,” Albarelli said. “Winnie brings a sort of intensity that everybody on the team understands and feels.”
Haggerty, a 2010 graduate of the University, serves as the team’s fitness coach, putting players through challenging endurance drills at the end of practice, once the team finishes running through plays and tackles. With about 20 minutes left in practice, Albarelli said, Haggerty prepares the team for fitness drills that push players to their limits – but that Albarelli said make a huge difference in competition.
“You always know when she goes to set up a drill, she has a smile on her face that says, ‘This is going to be fun.’ ” Albarelli said. “And you know it’s going to be the opposite of fun.”
The team is now preparing for Mid-Atlantic play, and will return to USA Rugby competition in June. Sophomore Beth Strader said, despite significant setbacks in the offseason, the root of the program’s success again this season lies in its unified front on the field.
“We don’t have a ‘best player,’ ” Strader said. “It is a collective effort that makes us win.”
Fellow freshman Shelby Steeves echoed Strader’s sentiments, adding that tight-knit camaraderie and unselfish play are two key aspects of competition that the women’s rugby team emphasizes. Both are key to the Colonials’ performance, Steeves said.
The Colonials will host Delaware March 24 to open Mid-Atlantic play, and should they emerge victorious, they will advance to the semifinals. The key against the Blue Hens is simple, Abarelli said. To win, the team simply needs to continue the unfaltering effort it has displayed since last season, through offseason shake-ups and into an undefeated fall campaign.
“They’re a good team, but if we play well and hard, we should beat them,” Albarelli said.
