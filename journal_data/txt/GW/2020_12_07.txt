On a special episode of “Getting to the Bottom of It,” host Alec Rich explores how GW’s real estate growth has impacted the Foggy Bottom community over time. In interviews with community members and public policy experts, the discussion tackles the responsibility of an urban university to its neighborhood and how GW can expand while minimizing the impact of issues like gentrification.

The years in this map were collected by first determining the square and lot numbers for each property through the D.C. GIS Master Address Repository. Those square and lot numbers were then searched in the D.C. Recorder of Deeds. Only buildings which had recorded deed transfers to GW are displayed on this map.

“Getting to the Bottom of It” is hosted by Alec Rich. This podcast is produced by Gwyn Wheeler. Music is produced by Aulx Studio. Special thanks to news editor Jarrod Wardwell, Marina Streznewski, Greg Squires, David Johnson and Eddie Suarez.

Try your hand at edibles this holiday season with some of our favorite recipes.
Cannabis-infused holiday treats are a relaxing way to celebrate the season, but maybe stick with classic sugar cookies for Santa.
As of last month, Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota joined 11 other states in the legalization of recreational cannabis use. If you live in one of those 15 states, you can take the holidays as an opportunity to experiment with making some of your own edibles.
Here are some yummy, cannabis-infused holiday treats you can make and a guide for prepping your cannabis for cooking.
Step one: Get your cannabis ready
Before you get to baking, you’ll need to activate your bud’s cannabinoids, the part of cannabis that makes you feel high, through a process called decarboxylation. This seems like a daunting task but all you’ll need is finely ground cannabis, an oven, parchment paper and a baking sheet.
To start, grind your cannabis into an evenly fine texture and preheat your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Next, line your baking sheet with parchment paper and spread your ground cannabis onto the parchment in an even layer. Bake this for 30 to 45 minutes before removing from the oven and allowing to cool.
Once you’ve done this, your cannabis is ready to be transformed. For most recipes, you’ll use the decarboxylated cannabis by first infusing it into butter or oil. For any infusion, use a one-to-one ratio, so for example, one pound of butter to one ounce of cannabis. Here are step-by-step recipes for “cannabutter,” “canna-oil” and cannabis tincture – each of which can be substituted for alcohol in the recipes below.
Once you’ve got these made, you can store them and use them as a replacement for butter or oil in most recipes.
Step two: Prepare your treats
Apple cider by CannabisWiki
This steamy drink with warm spices and a bit of tartness is great for ultra-relaxation.
What you’ll need:
Add the apple cider into a crockpot or deep boiling pot. Stir in the cinnamon sticks, sliced apple and cloves. Warm the mixture through on medium-low heat. Mix your tincture and brown sugar in a small bowl. Bring your apple cider mixture to a boil, and then add your brown sugar, tincture mixture and stir until combined. Turn off the heat and serve warm.
Marijuana snowball Christmas cookies by Texas Weed Syndicate
If you’re a fan of Italian wedding cookies, these buttery shortbread-style cookies will win you over. 
What you’ll need:
Heat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Whip the cannabutter, regular butter, one-half cup of powdered sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl. Stir in the flour and nuts and mix until a firm dough is formed. Shape the dough into golf ball sized pieces and place one inch from each other on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes and remove from the oven to let cool slightly. Finally, roll the cookies in powdered sugar and serve.
Cannabis peppermint bark by Las Vegas Cannabis Reviews
This cannabis-infused peppermint bark is a step up from your average chocolate bar edible.
What you’ll need:
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Fill a medium saucepan halfway with water and bring to a low boil. Place a medium to large metal bowl over the saucepan to create a double-boiler. Melt the white chocolate in the metal bowl until smooth. Add the canna-oil and peppermint extract to the melted white chocolate and stir to combine. Pour this mixture onto the parchment lined baking sheet and tap out to create a smooth layer, then place in the fridge to harden. Clean the metal bowl and melt the semi-sweet chocolate with the same technique. Once it’s all melted, pour the chocolate over the hardened white chocolate layer and sprinkle crushed candy cane on top. Allow to cool and serve.
Cannabis gingerbread loaf by Cannadish
This moist cake loaf will satisfy your gingerbread craving and is great for getting high any time of the day. 
What you’ll need:
Preheat your oven to 330 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease and flour a 9-inch loaf baking dish. In a large bowl, whip together the sugar and butter. Once the mix is light and fluffy, add in the egg and molasses and stir to combine. In a separate bowl mix, together the flour, salt and spices. Add the flour mixture into the creamed butter mixture and thoroughly combine. Whisk in the hot water and pour the batter into the baking dish. Bake for one hour or until a knife comes out clean from the center. Serve the cake warm or room temperature.

Spice up your charcuterie board with homemade crackers and cranberry chili jam.
Snacks are an irresistible part of any holiday gathering – and conveniently the easiest to whip up. 
You may be celebrating the holidays with fewer people than usual this year, but that’s not an excuse to slack on the appetizers. Whether you’re eating with friends at a socially-distanced outdoor party or chatting with family over Zoom, here are a few dishes that are guaranteed to please.
Cranberry & sweet chilli jam from BBC Good Food
This tangy, spicy jam is a festive take on cranberry sauce. Pair with cheddar crackers or appetizer meatballs, or just enjoy some crostini. Reduce the number of chiles if you prefer less spice.
What you’ll need:
In a food processor, finely chop half the cranberries, the ginger and the chiles. Pour into a pan and add the remaining cranberries, sugar and vinegar. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 20 to 30 minutes until thick and bubbling. Pour into jars and let cool. 
Slow cooker candied nuts from Taste of Home 
These nuts will provide a sweet counterpart to the savory dishes in your spread. They are quick to assemble, and the slow cooker does most of the work, leaving you plenty of time to plan the rest of your holiday feast. 
What you’ll need:
In a slow cooker, combine butter, sugar and spices. Mix in the nuts and cook on low for two to three hours until the nuts are crisp, stirring halfway through. Cool on wax paper. 
Figs with bacon and chile from Bon Appetit
This one-bite, gluten-free appetizer combines classic holiday flavors like figs and bacon and adds a chile kick. 
What you’ll need:
Cook the bacon in a skillet until crisp. Then, pour off all but two tablespoons of the fat, add maple syrup and heat. Place the figs’ cut side down in the skillet and cook until figs are softened and caramelized, about five minutes. Arrange the cooked figs on a platter and top with bacon. Then, add vinegar to juices remaining in the pan and cook down into a syrup. Add red pepper flakes and pour over figs. 
Cheesy garlic, herb and ham bites from Southern Living
These mini pastries will upgrade the classic holiday ham by combining prosciutto with cheese and parsley. 
What you’ll need:
Roll out puff pastry and cut into two inch rounds. Brush rounds with butter and top with cheese. Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes until golden, then top with prosciutto and parsley.
Cheddar holly crackers from Country Living
What would the holidays be without cheese? These crackers are delicious on their own or served with a dip, like the cranberry chili jam above. To be extra festive, use a cookie cutter to shape them or just cut into squares or triangles.
What you’ll need:
In a mixer, combine the butter and cheddar. Then, mix in the rosemary, salt and pepper, followed by the flour and one tablespoon of cold water. Roll the dough into a sheet one-fourth inch thick and chill. Use cookie cutters to cut out crackers or slice into shapes, then bake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for eight to 10 minutes until golden and cool on a rack.
Appetizer meatballs from The Spruce Eats
These jelly-glazed meatballs are an American holiday party classic. If you use pre-made frozen meatballs, this dish only takes a few minutes to prepare, and your slow cooker bears the brunt of the labor.
What you’ll need:
Place the meatballs in the slow cooker. Then, mix the minced onion, jelly and barbecue sauce and pour onto the meatballs. Cook on low for three to four hours or high for one and a half to two hours, then top with green onion and serve. 
Antipasto picks from Delish
Because they’re so customizable, these picks are a great option if you or your guests have dietary restrictions like a gluten or nut allergy. 
To make these picks, select an assortment of antipasti, like marinated artichokes, peperoncini or artichokes. Then, add some cheese, like mozzarella or fontina, or some cured meat like salami. Finish with fresh vegetables, like broccoli or cherry tomatoes. Assemble onto cocktail sticks, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and herbs like Italian parsley or basil before serving.
Crispy golden smashed potatoes from Good Housekeeping
Any good holiday table has at least one potato dish. These red potatoes are a combination of crispy outside and soft inside.
What you’ll need:
Combine potatoes, salt and water to cover in a large pot. Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes until tender, then drain. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Pour potatoes onto tray and smash each with a large, flat spatula and spray with cooking spray again. Bake for 25 minutes, then broil two to five minutes until crisp. Toss with butter, parsley and salt. 
Sesame roasted kale from Jamie Oliver
Roasted kale chips, like these flavored with sesame, are vegan and will add a delicious crunch to your holiday spread.
What you’ll need:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Rinse and dry the kale leaves, cut out the center stalk and slice into two inch pieces. Place the chips on a baking sheet and toss with oils, sesame seeds, salt and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes until edges are crisp, tossing halfway through.

Gerald Keusch, an infectious disease specialist from the Boston University School of Medicine, recommends that adherents skip out on organized services in church or temple this season to dodge COVID-19.
Before you invite friends and family over to swap presents, consider the risk of COVID-19.
Gerald Keusch, an infectious disease specialist from the Boston University School of Medicine and the associate provost for global health at the BU Medical Campus, fielded The Hatchet’s questions about everything from holiday shopping to visiting elderly family members this month. Keusch’s answers have been edited for length and clarity.
What are your biggest recommendations to keep the general public safe during the holiday season?
Gerald Keusch: My singular message has been to remain prudent and thoughtful about the risks of exposure but not to panic. Clear thinking based on information about the spread of the virus is essential. It is a great mistake to let political or other polarizing views or issues determine one’s behavior. COVID-19 is real, more than a quarter million Americans are dead, and everybody is at risk. However, nine months of experience with this pandemic in multiple countries demonstrates that simple rational measures can reduce transmission, illness and mortality.  
The single simple idea is to alter behavior to reduce exposure to an infected individual and with respect for others, to reduce the chances you might spread the virus if you were infected, whether you know it or not or are feeling well or have symptoms. These measures are to use a mask in public, keep socially distanced from others and avoid being in crowds – especially if there are lots of people you don’t know many or most of whom are not wearing masks – and wash your hands or use sanitizer if you touch something that could have been exposed to the virus.  
How do you think the COVID-19 pandemic will be affected by the holidays? 
GK: Adversely, for sure, and to the extent that people stop thinking about risk reduction for themselves and for others and become careless or cavalier about the basic public health behaviors then the transmission of infection and its consequences will increase…The more the outbreak continues, the longer it will take to return to more “normal” times.
What are the safest types of gatherings? The least safe? 
GK: It is easier to identify the least safe gatherings where large numbers of people are crowded indoors and many are not wearing masks. When you find that you can be sure that most of those people are meeting with others in similar circumstances which also increases the likelihood that one or more of them will be exhaling virus containing air and others in the room will be breathing it in.  The safest gathering will be a small number of people, all of whom you know and can trust that they are responsible and always practice good and prudent public health behavior and would let everybody know if they were exposed to somebody with the infection and decline the invitation to get together. 
Would you recommend attending holiday gatherings like religious services or office parties? 
GK: Office holiday parties are easy to address – this year they should be canceled unless the number of people is limited, the space they will be in is proportionately large and preferably outdoors, social distancing is possible and activities like singing – which increase the force of exhaling and spreading potentially virus containing air – are avoided. Religious gatherings are no different. A church, a synagogue or mosque are no more protective than a school or office building, and the same principles apply to all. In my view it is irresponsible and in fact immoral for religious leaders to assume and preach that a religious setting is any less risky to the participants than any secular setting might be.
What are your recommendations when it comes to exchanging gifts? 
GK: To be encouraged as these represent human to human feeling, bonding and support. I would include just sending a holiday card with a personal message as a gift – the gift of caring.
How can we safely shop for the holidays? 
GK: It’s too late to tell people to avoid the crush of Thanksgiving shopping venues, but the same principles of prudent behavior pertain. The least risky is online. The most risky is in line at a store or the check out counters when there are crowds, distancing cannot be maintained and some or most people are not wearing mask. This doesn’t mean you absolutely refuse to enter a shop, but you do refuse when the sane public health behaviors are flouted and crowding is unavailable.
What are your recommendations for visiting grandparents or the elderly? 
GK: Everybody has to think about whether they represent an increased risk to their grandparents or other elderly people they might visit. It comes down to the same issues to evaluate – have you been in settings of increase risk of transmission or have you been with somebody who has tested positive – sick or not sick – and could you be asymptomatically infected?  I would add to the decision analysis – otherwise known as thinking – to consider when the more risky contact occurred, and if it was at least seven days previously you are less likely to be infected, but for sure not 100 percent certain that is true.  Then, how well or frail are they? How old are they? Can you limit close contact during the visit? How long will you be together (another parameter affecting transmission is how long you are in proximity to an infected person)? And will everybody wear a mask?

Several traditional holiday events, from the White House tree lighting ceremony to the Times Square New Year's Eve events, have moved online due to the pandemic.
You might be eagerly waiting for the ball to drop in Times Square, but this year you’ll need to watch the calendar turn from home.
From “The Nutcracker” ballet to tree lighting ceremonies, a bucketload of long-standing holiday events are shifting online in light of the pandemic. Here’s a rundown of events to look out for online this holiday season and how you can access them.
Times Square New Year’s Eve
The organizers of Times Square New Year’s Eve announced in September that the annual tradition will take place on a complementary app, NYE 2021, which will be released Dec. 19. Using the app, you can see Times Square from your home, extend well wishes to friends around the world and share selfies on NYE on social media. You can also stream the evening on a live broadcast Dec. 31. 
In anticipation of the event, a virtual Times Square has been built by the owner of One Times Square, where the New Year’s Eve Ball drops. The event will celebrate “the best of the human spirit,” showcasing essential workers, first responders, doctors and scientists who have pioneered COVID-19 research over the past year, according to the event website. 
Rose Parade
A two-hour television special to replace the annual Rose Bowl Parade has been scheduled for New Year’s Day. The tape will include footage from previous year’s parades highlighting impressive floats and marching band performances. The creators of the Rose Bowl parade are also partnering with Feeding America to support people facing hunger during the holiday season. 
Viewers can watch the TV special on ABC, NBC, KTLA, Univision, Hallmark Channel and RFD-TV at 11 a.m. EST on Jan. 1. 
White House festivities
Because of the pandemic, the First Family lit the White House Christmas Tree privately last week, but you can re-watch the lighting ceremony and holiday performances of artists like Colton Dixon and Jillian Edwards online. If you’re in D.C., you can check out the 18.5-foot Fraser Fir tree from West Virginia yourself. 
In addition to the lighting ceremony, you can sign up to attend a limited capacity White House tour. The tour includes tributes to American service members and frontline workers, in addition to information of the nation’s history, wildlife and technology, according to a White House release.
George Balanchine’s “The Nutcracker“
This year’s production of “The Nutcracker” had been canceled due to the pandemic, but viewers will still be able to view a past production online via Marquee TV. 
This year’s show was filmed during the group’s 2019 season at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center. Stars include Maria Kowroski as the Sugarplum Fairy, Tyler Angle as Her Cavalier and Sophia Thomopoulos as Marie. 
This production of “The Nutcracker” features the New York City Ballet Orchestra directed by NYCB Music Director Andrew Litton and children performers from the School of American Ballet.
Anyone interested in watching can purchase a ticket on the Marquee TV website for $25. The performance will be available to view from Friday Dec. 11 to Jan. 3, and ticket holders will have 48 hours to finish watching after first play.

One student who celebrates Baba Marta, a Bulgarian holiday that recognizes the end of winter and the beginning of spring in March, exchanges red and white cloth bracelets with his friends and family.
Sophomore Gabriel Young tries to weave together Christmas traditions from his four ethnic and racial backgrounds.
Young, who identifies as Filipino American, Spanish, English and Chinese, said he and other Filipinos attend midnight church mass, which overlaps with the Spanish celebration of Nochebuena – or Christmas Eve. But as a Filipino American, he said he starts listening to Christmas tunes as early as September, the start of the yuletide season in the Philippines.
Young is one of six students who shared their heritages’ holiday traditions, which range from wearing white to ring in the new year to exchanging bracelets with friends and family. The students said practicing these customs help them embrace their cultural identity and connect more closely to their families.
“It’s more of an opportunity to study, understand and empathize with those who live in the country where my family’s from, and for me to reclaim the identity that I’d say I have to mold myself into toward the melting pot that is the United States instead of the salad bowl that it should be,” Young said.
Nica Albertson, a sophomore living in McLean, Virginia, and the president of the GW Bahá’i Club, said during big holy days – like the Day of the Covenant and the Ascension of Abdu’l-Bahá – she and her family come together, tell stories of Bahá’i history and sing. She said Bahá’is are encouraged to designate the Day of the Covenant, which usually falls on Nov. 25, as a time to practice unity, whether it be by visiting neighbors or sharing meals.
“The big message of the Day of the Covenant is that we should not have any enemies and that justice should be our underlying inspiration,” she said. “We’re encouraged to designate that day as whatever we see to unite the community.”
Albertson said one of the most important messages of the Bahá’i writings is empowerment, which the Bahá’i community reflects by singing and playing instruments on a djembe or guitar.
“The Bahá’i community is very characterized by its diversity in music,” Albertson said. “I’m just very enamored by that wide range of cultures and always learning.”
Bruna Janikian, a junior living in São Paulo and the president of BRASA GW, said Brazilians dress in white during New Years Eve to symbolize “peace” and “good vibes.” She said if they are at the beach, they “jump” seven waves and make a wish for something to happen during the new year.
“It reminds me every year [of] where I come from, and it’s a way of celebrating with my family,” she said in an email. “It feels right and makes me feel happy! If I don’t do that, it seems like I’m not ‘ready’ to start a new year.”
Irene Myo, an international student from Myanmar and the president of GW International Students Association, said she and her family host outdoor barbecues for New Years because Myanmar is relatively warm in the winter. She said she participates in the Buddhist traditions of freeing birds and fish as a way to cleanse for the new year.
Myo said she and other Buddhists pay their respects to monks by donating materials like lunch or basic necessities like rice and oil.
She said due to the pandemic, she won’t be able to go home and practice her New Years traditions with her family, but she plans to video call parents and her grandparents to pray and pay respect to them from afar. She said when she usually participates in traditions in Myanmar her favorite part is spending time with her family and practicing their traditions together.
“It just makes me feel much closer to both my religion and also my family,” she said. “And I love how when we do those traditions, people come together and we are engaged.”
Galen Ekimov, a junior living in south New Jersey, said in addition to Christmas and New Years, he celebrates Baba Marta, a Bulgarian holiday that recognizes the end of winter and the beginning of spring throughout the month of March. He said on Baba Marta, celebrated on March 1, he exchanges red and white cloth bracelets with his friends and family, called martenitsi, which symbolize the wish for good health and new life, throughout March until the month ends or they see a blossoming tree.
Ekimov said swapping martenitsi is special to him because he gets to see his family and friends.
“When I go to Central Park in NYC for example, and see martenitsi hung up on trees from past years of spring, I know Bulgarians or their friends have been there,” Ekimov said. “It’s a huge comfort, and it’s interesting to think about their lives and how we all came to the same spot at separate times under the same tradition.”
Sahar Qazi, a senior living in Houston, Texas, and the president of the GW Pakistani Students’ Association, said she and her family do not celebrate a specific holiday during the holiday season, but they do spend time with extended family and enjoy taking in the “ambiance” of other cultures like Christmas. She said she and her family come together on Christmas for a meal, then go to see Christmas lights at Space Center Houston or in a nearby neighborhood each year.
“We get consumed with our own lives, especially even the GW culture, like ‘Oh, internships, work, I have so much to do,’” she said. “It’s important to take a step back and realize OK, these are the people who supported me and made me who I am, and I need to appreciate and be thankful for each and every one of them.”
