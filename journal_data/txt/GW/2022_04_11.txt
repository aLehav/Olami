Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
When I first joined The Hatchet’s staff my freshman year, the graduating editors were giants to me. They seemed so much older and wiser, and I looked up to them. Surely, they knew all the answers.
By my senior year, I thought I’d have some big takeaway to share. A major moment, moral of the story, maybe an epiphany. But as my time on The Hatchet – and in college – draws to an end, I sometimes feel like I still don’t know what I’m doing.
I realized there wasn’t some secret wisdom you gain with seniority but rather a willingness to try. A perseverance and grit that comes when you’ve dedicated years to something.

The Hatchet is truly about taking it step by step (some larger than others), and suddenly you look up and you’re ready to pass the torch. For me, my time on the paper culminates in not one big lesson, but in all the little hidden ones I learned with each step:
Cold calling taught persistence. Interviewing built compassion. Editing increased patience. Rewrites grew humbleness. Pitching improved creativity.
I guess the moral of the story is that there doesn’t always need to be one – as long as you’ve grown along the way.
It’s safe to say that I wouldn’t be the journalist – or the person – I am today without The Hatchet and the editors of which it is composed.
Thank you to everyone who helped me take a step and gain more lessons along the way.
Molly: The greatest gift The Hatchet ever gave me was your friendship. From day one as culture editors, you were in my corner. When it comes to The Hatchet, there truly is no me without you. I am forever grateful to have you as my teammate, my collaborator, my partner in crime and my best friend. Your drive and talent will take you so far. Thank you for doing life with me.
Anna: The first time our names appeared in the paper, they were next to each other, and I will never forget that. Culture would not be what it is without you. You inspire me with your creativity and continuous dedication to journalism. Your presence brings me pure joy, and I can’t wait to visit you in your beautiful home in Maine one day.
Sarah Roach: Your leadership on The Hatchet meant so much to me. I am so lucky and grateful to have had the privilege to work with you. Your ability to lead with grace and generosity inspires me to this day, and I can’t wait to see everything you accomplish.
Sarah Urtz: Thank you for being my photo editor, but more importantly thank you for being my friend. You are an incredibly talented, incredible person. I know you are going to do big things and have big adventures.
Olivia Dupree: You are a gem. Thank you for chatting with me all of those late nights in the townhouse basement. Thank you for spearheading food discourse. And thank you for sharing your talents with The Hatchet. Your drive and kindness inspire me.
Lindsay: My OG culture queen, food inspiration, and the first person I looked up to as a baby freshman on The Hatchet – thank you for being an amazing editor. Thank you for being you.
Grace Hromin: I am so happy we got to be Hatchet buddies and class buddies this year. Your dedication to the photo team is so inspirational, and I can’t wait to see all you accomplish in the future.
Dante, Amanda & Thais: All three of you make me smile. You all possess such genuine talent and kindness. Dante, I loved collaborating with you when I was culture editor because you were always able to bring a new level of depth and creativity to a piece. Amanda and Thais, you absolutely slay.
Tyara: I have to give The Hatchet credit for introducing me to you, too. Having you as my best friend means the world to me. Thank you for your thoughtfulness, your support and your loyalty. You inspire me to chase my dreams, and I am eternally grateful to have you in my life.
Mom & Dad: I owe everything to you guys. I would not be where I am or who I am without your constant support and love. Thank you for always supporting my dreams.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
My work on the GW Hatchet newspaper was an incredibly solitary commitment at times. Still, it’s been unquestionably important to my sense of accomplishment, happiness and community on campus.
I was beyond excited when I was accepted to the culture section freshman year. I remember truly sweating over the application. Now as the editor of the section, I’m the one sending out the “welcome to the culture section” emails, something my freshman year self would think was so cool.
But the bizarre timeline between now and then has characterized how I view my progress on the paper.
For my freshman and most of sophomore year, The Hatchet didn’t really give me the social element that student organizations usually do. I was a reporter and then a staff writer, neither of which put me on the actual Hatchet staff. I would go to weekly culture section meetings and briefly socialize, but most of my work was individual and communication with the editors was mainly digital.
It was tough because I saw my friends who were in more traditional student organizations building social outlets for themselves. And as I started taking more and more stories, I didn’t really have time to join another club that would give me that community I was looking for.
I didn’t realize it then, but I was making two of my closest friends during that time I thought was so lonely. Sidney Lee and Molly Kaiser have been on the culture section with me since our first semester on campus. The first story I wrote was one I co-bylined with Sidney, just the other day we talked about how we met in Kogan Plaza to work on the draft together.
Sophomore year, Sidney and Molly were the editors of the section and I got to work with them on a regular basis. That fall semester they invited me to the staff holiday party, which was the first social event I’d attended for the Hatchet. I got to meet other people on staff and get a taste of what that next step up on the paper would look like for me. I was so excited.
That following spring of 2020, of course, was chaos. At the beginning of March, while the pandemic was still budding, I remember sitting at a table in Whole Foods with Sidney and Molly making the decision to move forward with becoming the editor of the culture section.
About a month later, my first time attending a staff meeting, something I’d been looking forward to for two years, was via Zoom in my childhood bedroom. Although I was excited to be the editor of the section, my enthusiasm was muted by the circumstances.
All my introductions to reporters and people I hadn’t met yet on staff were virtual. Every section meeting consisted of me talking to my laptop for 30 minutes. And we didn’t produce a single physical paper for my entire first year on staff.
Last spring, with the hope that we’d be returning to campus for my senior year. I decided to stay on as culture editor for another volume, and I’m so happy I did.
When we arrived on campus and kickstarted training for the volume, it was bizarre to see people I hadn’t seen in a year and half and meet people in-person that I’d only known by their Zoom squares. And the first time I had to lead a section meeting in-person, I experienced an unexpected wave of anxiety.
But as we got into the groove of the volume, I started to enjoy what I had been looking forward to since freshman year: the community of this paper.
The past two semesters, I’ve appreciated simple things about the job more than I would have if I hadn’t had to experience working on the last volume virtually. Having in-person meetings in the townhouse, getting to hang out with and collaborate with the other amazing student journalists on the paper way better than I could over Zoom and being able to report in D.C. again have all been highlights of my last two semesters on The Hatchet.
I wish I could have experienced this sooner than my senior year, but I wouldn’t change anything about how I spent my time on the paper.
Even weeks when I barely talked to other people on staff and when I didn’t want to open my computer for another Zoom meeting, I was getting more journalism practice than I could have in any class or internship.
My time on The Hatchet wouldn’t have been as meaningful as it was without some amazing people I’ve met along the way and support from the people I love:
Sidney and Molly: It’s been such a special thing to watch our friendship grow over the past four years that we’ve worked on the paper together. Regardless of how sporadically we see each other, we always pick up right where we left off and you’re two of my favorite people at this school. Here’s to more memories.
Clara Duhon: From the start of the volume, I knew we’d work really well together. You jumped right in and have been consistently impressive throughout our time together. Regardless of the task, you’re always willing to step up. You’re a stellar journalist and I can’t wait to see what culture puts out under your leadership in this coming volume. I couldn’t have asked for a better person to work with.
Sarah Roach and Lia DeGroot: With the creative liberty that comes along with the culture section, we’ve thrown out some crazy ideas and pitches over the past two volumes. You both have been wonderful to work with and always give our section just the right amount of room to explore that. Through editing and guidance, you’ve made me a better journalist and taught me how to be an editor. I wish you both the best in your careers and am incredibly grateful for our time together on the paper.
Editorial Board: One of my favorite parts of the week is the hour we spend together. I want to thank Andrew Sugrue and Hannah Thacker specifically for your excellent guidance through these meetings and the stimulating atmosphere you created. Listening to the perspectives of everyone on the board has been invaluable and I’ll cherish the sometimes dull, sometimes silly and sometimes contentious conversations we had.
Sydney, Shannon, Hana, Shereen and Grace: I still remember when you taped my first articles on your fridge in Thurston. You all know how much I love you and cherish our friendships. You’ve always been there for me to vent about anything Hatchet related and you’re my biggest cheerleaders.
Izzy and Jackie: I know you’re tired of the phrase, “Sorry I can’t, I have Hatchet” leaving my mouth – I am too. I’m so grateful for your support this year and can’t thank you enough for the hype you give me and my work on the paper.
My family: Even when I was just a reporter freshman year, you all were so excited about my work on this newspaper. Your enthusiasm has given me the motivation to stick with it like I did. I wouldn’t be where I am in life without your love and support, and I’m truly grateful for each of you.

As Arthur Wilson’s term as chair of the Faculty Senate’s executive committee comes to an end, faculty senators said he led faculty through the COVID-19 pandemic while pushing for efforts to improve shared governance with “skill” and “diplomacy.”
Wilson, an associate professor of finance, will conclude his two-year term as executive committee chair in late April after senators unanimously approved a resolution of appreciation for him at their meeting Friday. Faculty senators said Wilson was able to effectively advocate for professors’ increased involvement in administrative decisions as the University undergoes leadership changes and emerges from the pandemic.
Wilson joined the executive committee during the onset of the pandemic in April 2020 and has since spearheaded faculty efforts to improve shared governance at the University. He serves on the shared governance task force, which has devised recommendations for administrators, faculty and trustees to create “clear and frequent” channels of communication and collaborate on decisions like selecting the next University president.
“Over time, I think trustees realized we were as committed to the University as anybody,” Wilson said at Friday’s senate meeting.
Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights created the task force around the time when former University President Thomas LeBlanc announced his retirement last May.
Wilson was also a member of the team of professors who conducted a faculty survey last year on University leadership that found a majority of faculty had lost confidence in LeBlanc’s abilities.
Speights announced in the fall that the Board would delay the search for LeBlanc’s permanent replacement, citing a need to first strengthen shared governance to place GW in the best position possible to attract talent amid a large number of ongoing presidential searches nationwide.
“The University is more likely to succeed if we have robust participation on the faculty side of shared governance,” Wilson said in the meeting.
Wilson has served on the senate for more than 10 years and concluded his executive committee tenure after he reached the committee’s three-year limit, according to the resolution of appreciation. He declined a request for an interview.
Senators unanimously voted to approve the new slate of executive committee members at their meeting Friday, led by incoming executive committee chair Jim Tielsch, a faculty senator for at least four years and the chair of the Department of Global Health.
Tielsch did not return a request for comment.
The senate also approved a resolution of appreciation for Miriam Galston, an associate professor of law, who served as vice chair of the executive committee for two years alongside Wilson and will also conclude her term on the committee this spring.
Shaista Khilji, a professor of human and organizational learning and international affairs and a member of the executive committee, said Wilson led efforts to build a model of shared governance on the senate that promotes “transparency” among trustees, administration and faculty, which she hopes the new executive committee chair will replicate.
She said Wilson has stayed open-minded about faculty concerns and has kept the faculty “unified” through his leadership.
“He listens, cooperates and is not shy to learn about issues while also admitting his shortcomings,” Khilji said in an email.
Wilson entered his position during a period of faculty discontent with LeBlanc’s strategic vision to reduce GW’s incoming class sizes as part of an initiative to cut undergraduate enrollment by 20 percent over five years. Officials halted the plan when the pandemic hit and declared the plan “obsolete” in November 2020 amid undergraduate enrollment drops alongside widespread faculty criticism.
“Making sense of the gathering chaos while also charting a productive path was a challenging task,” Khilji said. “But Art managed it well with his teamwork skills.”
Anthony Yezer, a faculty senator who worked with Wilson on the senate’s fiscal planning and budgeting committee and a professor of economics, said Wilson helped “elevate the debate” during a time of tension among trustees, faculty and administrators.
“There is a narrow line between respecting and listening to others and still maintaining your position,” he said. “Arthur does this very well. Even where there is disagreement in a meeting, everyone leaves thinking that he has listened carefully to their point of view.”
Yezer said he expects Tielsch, the new chair of the executive committee, to take on issues like the search for a permanent University president and plans to potentially build new campus buildings as part of the Strategic Campus and Facilities Master Plan. Officials presented potential concepts for the future of GW’s campus like a “reimagined” Kogan Plaza with a new student center at a senate meeting in October.
“Finally the issue of long term planning for GWU, developing plans for what we want GWU to look like 5 or even 10 years in the future,” he said in an email.
Harald Griesshammer, a faculty senator on the executive committee and associate professor of physics, said Wilson had a “flexible” style of leadership where he established his opinions on how the University should operate without forcing his ideas onto the senators. He said Wilson was a “trustworthy conduit” between the trustees and administrators because of his ability to relay broader faculty sentiment to the Board.
“And nonetheless he would, in the end, be a faithful spokesperson for the faculty and not for his own opinion,” Griesshammer said.
Griesshammer said he hopes Tielsch will improve communication among trustees, administration and faculty because it is difficult to predict what the Board wants from the faculty to reach goals like a 75 percent faculty tenure rate. He said Wilson’s dedication to listening to faculty has provided a “fresh start” for faculty representation with trustees since the beginning of his term.
“I think the new chair is going to pick up the baton to continue and improve the relations between the Board and the faculty and the administration,” he said. “I think in particular, the relation to the Board is really crucial there.”

The restaurant’s complimentary side sauces blend perfectly with any of the menu items – their signature Habibi sauce and smooth garlic sauce each provide an extra hop of flavor to dishes. 
Location: 2000 Pennsylvania Ave. NW
Readers’ pick: Falafel Inc.
As Foggy Bottom’s dining scene is going through a slew of changes, Falafel Inc. has established itself as one of the best new eateries on campus for students on the hunt for a tasty bite at an excellent price.
The Foggy Bottom community embraced the arrival of more than 10 restaurants in Western Market over the past year, with more yet to arrive. The chicken sandwich joint Roaming Rooster, Venezuelan vendors Arepa Zone and Italian deli Capo Deli have each delivered distinct tastes to students, but one restaurant rises above the pack.
Falafel Inc.’s quality, convenience and affordability positions the vendor as the food court’s ideal restaurant to grab a quick bite during a busy day.
The menu is simple but delectable. With ingredients like falafel, lettuce and pickled red cabbage all stuffed in fresh pita, the falafel sandwiches ($4) are the star of the menu, a tasty and easy-to-eat sandwich that fulfills all culinary desires.
Falafel Inc. offers solid vegan options, namely its shawarma sandwich ($5), made with vegan meat, red umami cabbage and lettuce. The restaurant also offers fresh falafel bowls ($5) for cleaner eaters and tasty zaatar – a Middle Eastern spice blend – fries ($3), and service is quick and convenient.
The restaurant’s complimentary side sauces blend perfectly with any of the menu items – their signature Habibi sauce and smooth garlic sauce each provide an extra hop of flavor to dishes.
The location makes it easy for friends to grab bites from other vendors in the building, ensuring no one is left out from purchasing their preferred meal. For a tasty post-meal sweet, walk a few feet and grab dessert at Captain Cookie or Capo Deli.
You can feel comfortable spending your money at Falafel Inc., too – every meal purchased is paired with a donation to refugees in need as part of a collaboration with the World Food Programme, a branch of the United Nations.
Earning my vote as one of the freshest new restaurants in D.C., Falafel Inc.’s quality food and convenience establishes the spot as the best new restaurant in Western Market.

Matching and patterned sets are ideal for a put-together look that takes little to no effort to plan, and you can mix pieces to expand your outfit options. 
Readers pick: Claw clips
After about a year and a half of quarantining, online instruction and postponed in-person events, the fashion industry’s outlook on spring 2022 fashion has circulated around one underlying mindset: if we’re finally going out, we’re going to look bright and bold doing it.
This trend takes the win for our fashion category for its convenience, vintage inspiration and potential for variation. While trends like knitwear and claw clips have definitely gained popularity in recent months, they don’t present as many fashion possibilities as matching and patterned sets.
Spring 2022 fashion will be full of eye-catching bold patterns and color palettes. And unique to this trend, you also won’t have to sacrifice convenience and comfort to achieve eccentric style. That’s why the resurgence of patterned and matching sets have made its way to the front of fashion shows like Versace and Maison Margiela and onto the streets of New York and D.C.
Matching and patterned sets are ideal for a put-together look that takes little to no effort to plan. Items are not limited to one outfit, as you can mix tops and bottoms with other items of clothing while still looking chic and trendy this spring.
Get ready to rock matching gingham or checkered crop tops and oversized pants sets and see bright color palettes reminiscent of Jennifer Garner’s famous “13 Going on 30” dress this spring. Colors like grass green, soft lilac and canary yellow, which have found their way onto the backs of celebrities like Ariana Grande and Anne Hathaway, are popping up everywhere in D.C. stores stocking for the season.
Most recently, rapper and actor Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, and actor David Oyelowo wore bright yellow-green suit sets to the 2022 Oscars while actress Zendaya wore a matching suit set to an Oscars after party.
Patterned sets have event found their way into the White House. Singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo wore a pink plaid Chanel skirt suit set to the White House last year after she was invited to serve as a celebrity ambassador to encourage teenagers to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Matching and patterned skirt suits or pantsuits are a chic way to look stylish in both professional and casual settings, since this trend can be dressed up or down. As matching sets make their way onto the spring 2022 runway, they’ll soon make their way into your closet hopefully awaiting that coveted Hillternship debut.

The market’s rule to keep pups away doesn’t doesn’t stop swarms of people attending each week with their best friends. 
Location: 1600 20th St. NW
Readers’ pick: Dupont farmers market
If you’re missing your furry friends from home, take time to fawn over all of the adorable dogs you’ll see at the Dupont Circle farmers market.
Every Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. a stretch of 20th Street in Dupont Circle bustles with vendors selling local produce, artisan products and street food – and lucky for us, many of the shoppers bring their dogs along. While places like the National Mall or Rock Creek Park are also dog hotspots, there’s no other spot in the city where you can find the same density and variety of dogs that the Dupont Circle farmers market delivers.
Since the market is packed into two blocks, you’re sure to see a dog every few seconds despite the fact that its website states they’re strongly discouraged. More than 50 stands selling organic produce and goods line the streets. And starting May 5, there will be Thursday hours from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.
Whether you are there strictly to scout the dog scene or wrangle up fresh veggies for a spring salad, a list of the items you need – or the dog breeds you would like to pet – will help hone your hunt. As you stroll the market shopping for seasonal fruits and vegetables to whip up a fresh meal, you might notice that the most prevalent dog breed at the market seems to be the goldendoodle.
The curly cuties are popular for their sharp brains, inherited from their poodle side and their friendly disposition coming from their golden retriever genes. These dogs usually love attention and pets, but make sure you ask the owner before approaching. You’re also likely to spot French bulldogs and Australian shepherds – both popular city dogs.
All breeds of dogs gravitate toward the strong smells at the market like Shepherd’s Whey Creamery, which sells minimally processed cheese, or the sizzling bacon cooked at the Call Your Mother Deli stand. For a sure-fire dog sighting, these are prime locations.
But most dogs are at the mercy of their leash, so you are equally likely to make a furry friend at any stop along the market. Benches scattered around the market offer a popular hangout spot for people and their pets.
The market’s rule to keep pups away doesn’t stop swarms of people attending each week with their best friends. Make sure to plan a trip this Sunday for a substantial dose of doggy dopamine.

Gallery Place-Chinatown offers genuine dining and shopping experiences to grab a taste of Chinese and Asian culture and explore pinnacle D.C. landmarks. 
Location: 630 H Street NW
Readers’ pick: Gallery Place-Chinatown
The next time you’re aching to escape campus for a few hours – or a day trip – tap your U-Pass into the Gallery Place-Chinatown station for an enriching and cultural experience like no other neighborhood in D.C.
Under Chinatown’s spectacular Friendship Arch, you can try high-end restaurants, catch a music concert, take a quick stop by a museum or check out a chic speakeasy. In addition to being a spot for an enticing outing, the history and culture behind this lively area helps to make this locale in particular stand out among the other Metro stops in D.C.
Throughout U.S. history, Chinatowns across the nation were created to grow community and protection for Chinese communities facing discrimination and racist laws, like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers until it was repealed in 1943. While D.C.’s Chinatown was once populated with 3,000 Chinese residents in the 1970s, housing prices have spurred the gentrification of the area, leaving fewer than 300 Chinese Americans remaining as of 2017.
While you’re in the area, explore a few Asian markets like Da Hsin Trading Inc, an authentic spot packed with Asian snacks, pottery and furniture. For a 7-Eleven-like Chinese grocery and convenience store, check out Chinatown Market just a block away from the Metro stop.
Try new flavors at restaurants like Reren in the heart of Chinatown serving up Chinese-style ramen and other delectable Asian dishes. Hit up hole-in-the-wall China Boy for an excellent dim sum experience, though you might want to take your order to-go since the location is quite small.
Chinatown is also home to some of renowned chef José Andrés’ most magnificent restaurants, like Zaytinya for upscale Mediterranean cuisine.
Grab a low-key drink at Denson, a liquor bar just a block away from the Portrait Gallery providing an intimate, classy feel tucked away from the livelihood of Chinatown’s nightlife. The dimly lit speakeasy resembles an old-timey train station with white and black-patterned hexagon tiles on the floor and a gold and back, industrial-looking divider in the center of the room.
The bar offers a wide selection of small bites and cocktails, including the pretty in pink ($15), made with vodka, rosé vermouth, rose water and sugar – a spin on the classic cocktail.
When you first hop off the Metro stop, you’ll find yourself steps away from gems like the National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which both offer enriching exhibitions like a series of portraits portraying the historical figures that are now the namesakes of various D.C. streets and public spaces.
Gallery Place-Chinatown offers genuine dining and shopping experiences to grab a taste of Chinese and Asian culture – as well as pinnacle D.C. landmarks to explore – earning our rank as the best Metro station.

Bill and Hillary Clinton chose the 9:30 club as the venue for a private party they threw in 2001. 
Location: 815 V St. NW
Reader’s Pick: 9:30 Club
From the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana to Kacey Musgraves and Rainbow Kitten Surprise, the 9:30 Club has hosted some music powerhouses in its intimate yet energetic environment.
The concert venue was founded in 1980, hosting just six concerts in its first two years operating but has put on more than 2,700 since. The 9:30 club tends to attract smaller, independent artists, providing the concert-goers get an interactive, immersive experience with the artist, earning it The Hatchet’s pick for best concert venue.
The 9:30 Club shares an owner with The Anthem, but the experiences at the two venues couldn’t be more different. The massive size of The Anthem attracts more mainstream artists, and the line to get in is long, the crowd can be overwhelming and you usually don’t have a great view of the artist.
While the 9:30 Club’s original venue was a cultural center for The District’s emerging punk-rock scene in the 1980s, the steady increase in the club’s notoriety and performances led to its 1996 shift to a location with more capacity. By that time the club had hosted artists including The Ramones and REM, even featuring the Smashing Pumpkins in its opening show for the new location.
Today, the 9:30 Club continues to host a variety of artists and events, it even served as the venue for a private party the Clintons threw in 2001.
The outside of the club is simplistic in nature, echoing similar brick stone buildings without a window in sight. Yet the interior of the club really shines through with the ensemble of lighting and sound systems, including a unique rolling stage experience that lets the 9:30 Club create a more intimate setting.
The 9:30 Club continues this simplicity in its presentation of artists, relying on the musicians and crowd to set the mood and ambiance rather than over-the-top special effects, but the stage is usually decorated minimally to fit each headliner’s vibe. The 9:30 Club’s emphasis on the artists makes for an open and inclusive atmosphere that can highlight an audience’s love for the artists at its core.
Aside from the main stage and the performances of the various artists hosted by the 9:30 Club, the venue also runs two full service bars and operates a merchandise booth for artists to stock with their merch each show.
The next time you’re looking for concert tickets, check if your artist of choice will be making appearance at the 9:30 Club – you won’t regret it.

When I received my housing assignment for the next academic year, I was met with simultaneous excitement and immense fear. I got placed into a four-person residence hall with someone I planned to live with already, but the other two were complete strangers. It is not abnormal for students to receive housing assignments with random people – students are asked to fill out questionnaires so housing officials can match them with like-minded people. But the fear I felt came from not knowing whether my new roommates would accept my identity.
As a nonbinary and pansexual person, I am part of the LGBTQ+ community and very visibly so. My pronouns are they/them, and I do not appreciate gendered terminology being used for me. The thoughts that raced through my mind as I got my housing assignment were, “What if my new roommates do not respect my pronouns?” or “What if they are uncomfortable living with a nonbinary person?” The questionnaire that GW includes in their housing applications should have optional questions about sexuality, gender identity and if it is preferable to live with queer people.
In a perfect world, being queer would not be a detriment to housing situations, but the reality is that not everyone understands or accepts the LGBTQ+ community as much as is needed to live with them. Some of my friends have needed to request a room swap in the past due to homophobic and transphobic roommates. At Rutgers University, a student died by suicide in 2012 after learning that his roommate spied on his sexual encounters and intimidated him for being gay.
There are many more reasons as to why a queer student would prefer to live with other students in the same community. Just thinking about having to explain my gender identity to my new roommates is exhausting for me, even if they are as accepting as possible. In a space that should be for relaxation, I do not necessarily want to explain my existence, I simply want to be understood. Straight or nonally roommates do not have the knowledge of or exposure to the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community the same way that queer people do, which can make queer students feel unwelcome or even endangered.
If a transgender student is not out to anyone in their college community but has to be out to their roommates, there can be a large fear of this information being shared nonconsensually. Queer people understand that they are discriminated against, and so some people in the LGBTQ+ community prefer not to share their identity or are simply not ready. Straight, cisgender people will never comprehend the risk that queer people go through every day by just existing, hence why they could out their roommates and put them in harms way without even intending to.
To better protect LGBTQ+ students and be aware of their needs, GW needs to broaden the questions they ask in their housing application. By making the questions optional, those who feel strongly about their identity are able to prioritize it and make sure they receive roommates who are accepting and understanding of them. Likewise, those who are not sure of their identities would not have to answer those questions if they are not ready to share that information.
Adding these questions allows for students to express interest in rooming with other queer people, or not, which would therefore create a more cohesive living situation for all. If a student is not comfortable living with members of the LGBTQ+ community, the answer is not that they should still live together so that the straight, cisgender roommate becomes more accepting – that would put students in the position of needing to spend emotional energy educating their peers about their very existence as a queer person. It could even put queer students in danger if they end up with roommates who are not accepting of their basic identity. It is not queer students’ job to teach their roommates about how to be accepting – it is the University’s job to make sure all students can have a basic level of safety and inclusion in their homes away from home.
In its housing forms, Northern Arizona University includes questions about sexuality and gender along with responses like “Not comfortable for me – I would not feel comfortable living with someone who identifies as LGBAQ+,” “Somewhat comfortable for me – I would feel somewhat comfortable living with someone who identifies as LGBAQ+,” and “Very comfortable for me – I would feel very comfortable living with someone who identifies as LGBAQ+.” NAU acknowledges that living together means interacting every day and sharing personal space – having that level of interaction with someone who is not accepting of a queer student’s identity will inevitably be awful.
Just like a student may not want to live with someone who is messy or a female student may not want to live with a man, there are students who do not want to have queer roommates, and that cannot be ignored. This is not meant to preserve the feelings of the nonallies but to preserve the safety, peace and dignity of queer students. This could cause an environment rife with anything ranging from basic ignorance and microaggressions to outright homophobia or transphobia. Queer students do not deserve to have to put up with this.
Adding questions about gender and sexuality to the housing questionnaire in no way implies that everyone in the straight community is unaccepting of queer people or that straight, cisgender people cannot live with LGBTQ+ people. There simply must be a way for queer students to ensure their safety in their housing situations if they are worried about not being accepted. A residence hall is effectively a student’s home when they’re at college – and everyone deserves to feel safe and comfortable at home.
