Students said the University's in-house COVID-19 testing center has been quick and reliable services to those living on and off campus.
2020 was a year like none other for GW.
Nearly every aspect of campus life has been upended as the coronavirus pandemic pushed the University community to remote learning. Students and faculty have adapted to keep up with classes remotely while departments across the University have dealt with drastic budget cuts and layoffs to stay afloat.
Here are some of the biggest events the community witnessed throughout this year:
COVID-19 strikes the District

D.C. officials confirmed the District’s first case of COVID-19 in early March, prompting officials to instruct students to transition classes online for at least two weeks. Less than a week later, administrators announced that the remainder of the spring semester would be conducted remotely.
After initially planning to bring students back to campus for the fall semester, officials changed course and announced late July that the fall semester would be conducted entirely online. Officials decided in early October to continue online learning for the spring semester as well.
Administrators have not made any formal announcements about whether classes will remain online for the upcoming fall semester, but University President Thomas LeBlanc said he is hoping for an in-person fall semester in time for the completion of the University’s bicentennial celebrations.
Throughout the year, officials have also been working to address the financial impacts of the pandemic on GW through varying measures like a hiring freeze, a salary freeze, a pay cut for top administrators and hundreds of staff layoffs. Officials announced in early December that they have concluded all expected layoffs implemented in response to the pandemic’s financial challenges.

Despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, the GW community has found ways to persevere and help one another through stages of the pandemic.
Students and faculty have quickly adapted to the online environment, picking up part-time jobs and adjusting their schedules to accommodate their families’ needs. Community members throughout Foggy Bottom also stepped up to provide meals and financial assistance to some of their most vulnerable neighbors.
A group of students banded together at the start of the semester to create a mutual aid fund to provide financial assistance to students in need.
GW’s research infrastructure took a front-seat role in the race for a vaccine when a group of researchers from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences joined research teams across the country to take part in a Moderna, Inc.’s COVID-19 vaccine trial. The trials are a part of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ COVID-19 vaccine development initiative.
GW’s trial exceeded its targets for including a diverse group of participants in its study, with more than half of the trial’s participants identifying as Black or Latino. Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser for Operation Warp Speed, spoke at a press conference on campus with the researchers in October, thanking the trial’s participants and encouraging members of the public to participate in a trial.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the Moderna vaccine earlier this month, and health officials have started distributing vaccines to frontline health care workers throughout the District.

A sign is posted on the door of the Smith Center reading “Building closed indefinitely." A-10 officials announced Friday that fall sports are held until the spring semester.
The COVID-19 pandemic played a major role on GW’s sports teams, canceling the remainder of spring sports in March and announcing in July that fall sports would be postponed to spring 2021.
Officials announced in late September that GW will cut seven sports programs at the end of the 2020-21 season due to financial concerns in light of the pandemic. Men’s rowing, sailing, men’s and women’s squash, men’s indoor track, men’s tennis and women’s water polo will be eliminated, affecting more than 100 student-athletes.
In response, alumni from the men’s and women’s squash teams wrote an open letter and launched a petition in August urging officials to reconsider their decision to remove the programs, arguing that squash did not pose a financial burden on the University.
After spending the summer staying in shape from home, the men’s and women’s basketball teams came back to campus this semester under strict safety protocols to participate in the season.
Tensions build between LeBlanc, faculty

LeBlanc has faced criticism from students, faculty and staff throughout his tenure at GW, but their frustrations came to a head in 2020.
LeBlanc was recorded using a racially insensitive analogy during a conversation with a freshman about the possibility of GW divesting from fossil fuels in February.
The video, which circulated on social media, showed him comparing support for fossil fuel divestment to hypothetical support for shooting “all the Black people here.” LeBlanc apologized for his remarks amid backlash from the Student Association, advocates for divestment and other community members.
Support for LeBlanc dwindled throughout the remainder of the year as students, faculty and staff launched dozens of petitions and letters calling for him to resign or reverse recent layoffs and financial decisions resulting from the pandemic.
The petitions and letters criticized LeBlanc for the University’s partnership with the Disney Institute and for his plans to cut undergraduate enrollment by 20 percent. His plans to cut undergraduate enrollment were part of his broader strategic plan, which also included aims to increase the ratio of undergraduate STEM majors at the University to 30 percent.
The Faculty Senate passed a resolution in February criticizing officials for violating principles of the shared governance while making decisions for enrollment changes linked to the 20/30 Plan.
Due to the pandemic, officials put the plan on hold in April and planned to reassess its goals but have since concluded it has been likely “rendered obsolete” as the pandemic has changed many of the plan’s key assumptions regarding enrollment and GW’s financial status.
Faculty, staff and students have also criticized officials’ lack of transparency amid ongoing layoffs of staff members at several offices like the Center for Career Services, Events and Venues and academic advising.
Faculty lambasted LeBlanc and other administrators in August for the hiring of Heather Swain, who was ridiculed for a lack of transparency in the Larry Nasser sexual abuse case at Michigan State University, as GW’s vice president for communications and marketing. Swain rescinded her job offer less than a week later after widespread backlash from GW community members.
Faculty senators debated a resolution in September to censure LeBlanc for hiring Swain but instead voted the next month to express “extreme disapproval” of LeBlanc over outright censure.
Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights defended LeBlanc at a Board meeting in October after SA President Howard Brookins signed an executive order calling for LeBlanc to resign.
Students continue push for divestment, name changes

The announcement comes after officials announced last month that all GW community members will need to receive the COVID-19 vaccine before returning to campus in the fall. 
Prompted by student activism, the GW community also underwent a wave of social change this year.
The SA senate passed a resolution in January calling for the University’s divestment from fossil fuels and for GW to cut ties with the Regulatory Studies Center, which has been accused of promoting an anti-regulatory stance. Nearly 86 percent of students voted in favor of a referendum calling for divestment during SA elections in March.
Sunrise GW has held numerous protests throughout the year calling for divestment. After years of student activism, the Board voted in June to divest GW’s endowment from fossil fuel companies by 2025.
Following a slew of student-led petitions urging administrators to re-name buildings named after controversial historical figures, LeBlanc established two committees to evaluate the name change requests for the Marvin Center and the Colonials moniker.
Student leaders expressed hope that officials would revamp the University’s diversity and inclusion practices after a history professor revealed in September that she had falsely claimed a Black identity. But they also suffered from exhaustion at a continuation of racial incidents at the University.
Jessica Krug, a professor of history who specialized in Black, Latin American and African American history, admitted in a Medium post that she had falsely claimed to be Black for years.
Students who took Krug’s class said they felt “betrayed” that she had lied about her identity. Krug resigned from her position a few days after her post was published.

Protests, Zoom meetings and a quiet campus defined the calendar year for GW.
The Hatchet’s photo team looked through images that captured some of those significant moments throughout 2020. From demonstrations over racial injustice to celebrations in Foggy Bottom after former Vice President Joe Biden was elected as the next president, here are some of the most memorable shots of the year:

Sophomore guard Jameer Nelson Jr. and senior forward Ace Stallings are leaving the men’s basketball program, athletic department spokesperson Brian Sereno confirmed Tuesday.
Nelson Jr. and Stallings are the second and third players to leave the program within a week after senior guard Maceo Jack announced his intention to leave the team last week. The duo were in their second year with the program.
Nelson Jr. will enter the transfer portal and seek to play at another school, while Stallings opted out to dedicate more time to a “business venture” he will pursue before he graduates in May, Sereno said.
Nelson Jr. was a late commit to GW after he decommitted from fellow Atlantic 10 member Saint Joseph’s in April 2019 and signed on to play for then-newly instated head coach Jamion Christian. In his first year with the program, he found a spot in the starting rotation, starting 28 of the team’s 32 contests.
He averaged 10.4 points a game – good for fourth on the squad – shooting at a .415 clip from the field. He averaged 31 minutes a game and led the team in steals with 55. Nelson Jr.’s 94 turnovers and 68 assists ranked second on the squad.
Christian said before the start of the season in October that Nelson Jr. is a dynamic player who was on the up-and-up. He slated Nelson Jr. and sophomore guard James Bishop as a one-two punch for the Colonials before the year started.
In his first seven games of 2020-21, Nelson Jr.’s time on the court decreased to 26.3 minutes per game, and he started five nonconference contests. He was averaging 8.4 points a game and racked up a team-leading 18 steals with 14 assists and 15 turnovers. He was hitting 39.2 percent of his shots from the field and just 25 percent from deep.
Stallings transferred into the program in May 2019 after Christian took over the helm. He previously played under Christian at Mount St. Mary’s. In his first season with the Colonials, Stallings played primarily off the bench, averaging 8.1 minutes per game without a start. He scored 1.6 points a contest on 18-of-32 shooting and ripped 1.7 rebounds a game.
To start off the 2020-21 season, Stallings saw limited time on the floor, playing in just four games and averaging 4.8 minutes of action. He scored one point on 1-of-2 free throw shooting and did not attempt a field goal. Stallings snatched two offensive rebounds and one defensive rebound this season.
The Colonials (2-6) faltered in nonconference play, starting the season 1-6, but broke their winning draught with a win over Fordham to kick off A-10 play Wednesday. GW is back in action Saturday to take on Duquesne at 12:30 p.m.

Men’s basketball junior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. will use the 2020-21 season to practice, despite the NCAA Division I Council granting a blanket transfer waiver, head coach Jamion Christian said last week.
The NCAA Division I Council voted earlier this month to allow eligible transfers in all sports to be immediately eligible to play during the 2020-21 season. But Christian said Lindo Jr., who transferred from Maryland in April, will not see time on the floor this year.
“As of right now it won’t be this season,” he said. “He’s enjoying his development process. We’re enjoying doing that with him, and we know if we do that right we’re going to have a great player start of next season, and that’s what our focus is with him.”
Sophomore guard James Bishop, who came in from LSU in April, was previously granted a waiver to forgo his year on the sidelines prior to the season.
Division I Council Chair Grace Calhoun said the waiver will give student-athletes more flexibility during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
“Allowing transfer student-athletes to compete immediately will provide additional opportunities to student-athletes during this continued difficult time, and perhaps allow games to be played that otherwise might not have been,” Calhoun said in the release.

As much as we hope for 2021 to be better than this unfortunate year, it’s foolish to assume the new year will change everything. 
When the clock strikes midnight, we will still be in the grips of a pandemic, millions of Americans will continue to struggle financially and thousands of students will still take classes remotely. Many of us will continue our lives in our childhood bedrooms, alone in an apartment or a residence hall room. A new calendar year won’t change a thing.
Our immediate lives might look the same, but there is something promising about a new year. We can renew hopes for something better, and in this country’s situation, the only way we’ll see something better is if we wear our masks and keep our distance.
December has so far proven to be the deadliest month of the pandemic. More than 300,000 American lives have been taken so far, roughly 63,000 of which have taken place this month alone. It is undeniable that the holidays and the past nine months of isolation, quarantine and social distancing have caused many of us to experience “pandemic fatigue.” We need to remember that this is the final stretch and if we don’t break the rules tonight or in the new year, we might live more safely in 2021.
We are tired of not seeing our friends and family, spending birthdays and holidays alone, not being in school and missing everything else that this pandemic has cost us. But that does not mean that it is time to pretend that the virus is not a threat and go on with our everyday lives as if nothing is happening. 
I have seen countless tweets and posts talking about how 2020 will finally be over and how 2021 will hold greater possibilities and more freedoms. This wishful thinking is setting us up for disappointment. Yes, 2020 has been difficult and it seemed like it was all just one punch after the other. But assuming that 2021 won’t hold the same fate is mildly delusional. 
States across the United States are facing vaccine shortages, new strains of COVID-19 are popping up left and right, our hospitals are overflowing and there are more and more cases being reported every day. There is nothing but hope and promises from elected officials to indicate that this turmoil will end anytime soon.
While this may seem overly pessimistic and “negative Nancy-esque,” it is important to face reality instead of hiding from it. We must prepare for the state of the pandemic to be either the same or worse in the new year. Even though 2021 promises more vaccinations and holds the possibility of mass immunization against this pandemic, it is going to be a long wait until we get to that point and we must remain vigilant in our efforts to prevent the spread. Don’t go out tonight, and please keep your distance in the new year.

As coronavirus-related deaths reach record highs, President Donald Trump made the brazen move to demand that the U.S. Senate pass $2,000 stimulus checks for Americans – giving hope to millions of Americans.
Here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up
GOP senators signed off on $600 stimulus checks last week for struggling Americans, sparking outrage from millions who want and need more financial assistance. Trump became a surprising advocate for a larger stimulus check and urged Republicans to consider giving Americans more aid.
While I disagree strongly with mostly everything the president has done during his tenure in office, this final show of solidarity with the American people is a net positive, albeit a confounding one.
The American people need help, and if Trump is going to end up being the one to bring aid to millions, he should be applauded for it. Americans are still struggling to make ends meet, even if the economy is doing relatively well.
Businesses have been shuttered, many cities and states are entering strict lockdowns for the holiday season and thousands remain unemployed. $2,000 stimulus checks would not pull everyone out of their financial graves, but it would cover much more than a laughable $600. People could actually pay for the essentials, like rent, insurance and food.
Thumbs Down:
Heading into the holiday season, Americans were warned that post-Thanksgiving parties and holiday travel would contribute to an increase in COVID-19 cases. These warnings have come true – December marks the deadliest month of this pandemic.
About 63,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 in December alone, despite countless advisories against holiday travel and get-togethers. It can also be expected that the number of deaths may increase in the new year after data comes back for Christmas and New Year’s gatherings.
While people want everything to go back to normal, December shows us what happens when we try to rush. Until there is mass immunization, we must recognize the cost of ignoring public health guidelines. Family is important and being away from them during the holiday season is devastating. But what’s more devastating is the hundreds of thousands of lives we cost because we selfishly wanted a party.

Say goodbye to 2020 with a decadent takeout order, a bottle of champagne and the Times Square Ball Drop.
You may not be able to kiss someone on New Year’s Eve or pop champagne with strangers this year, but don’t let that get in the way of having fun. 
From festive eats to New Year’s-themed broadcasts, here’s how you can make the night memorable from the safety of your home.
Get the people you live with excited
Whether it’s your roommates, family or cat, you can still celebrate with loved ones this year — just in smaller numbers. 
The people you live with might be burnt out from the holiday season or simply spending time with one another. But if there were ever a time to rally, it’s New Year’s Eve. If you want your night to be more exciting than sitting on the couch trying to stay awake for the ball drop, you’ll need to get everyone in your house pumped for a night of festivities.
One way to inspire some enthusiasm would be to assign everyone tasks to prep for the night. Someone can be in charge of food, another alcohol and someone else can get activities like photos and games planned. You could put someone in charge of planning the grocery list, hitting the store, ordering the food, picking party games or setting up a photo backdrop. 
Extravagant takeout menu
Holiday cooking might have you sick at the sight of your kitchen. That’s OK. Pick up your phone and browse the menus of your favorite restaurants in town. 
This isn’t the night to be modest with the Grubhub bill, either. Think about the money you’d usually spend club hopping and Ubering around town on New Year’s Eve and redirect those funds to an indulgent takeout meal. If you live in D.C., here is a list by Eater DC of restaurants offering special deals on New Year’s Eve.
If you want to make the experience of ordering food more exciting, have each person order takeout for a different course: appetizers, main course, dessert and late-night snacks. 
Appetizers all day
If you’re a die-hard foodie or just want to try out new recipes from your favorite food blogger or culinary magazine, opt for making appetizers throughout the night instead of laboring over a huge dinner.
Here’s a couple recipe ideas for inspiration:
Creamy Goat Cheese, Bacon and Date Dip from NYT Cooking
What you’ll need:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. In a medium bowl, mix together the cheese and lemon juice. Add in salt and pepper to taste, then transfer to a 1 quart baking dish, spread evenly. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until bubbling. While this bakes, cook bacon pieces in a skillet on medium-low heat until crisp. Use a slotted spoon to remove bacon from the skillet and transfer to a paper-towel lined plate. Using the rendered bacon fat, lightly sauté the date pieces for one minute or until hot and crackling. Top the baked cheese with bacon and dates. Add garnishes and serve.
3 Ingredient Cheesy Pizza Pretzels from Half Baked Harvest
What you’ll need
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange pretzels on the baking sheet and add pepperoni and cheese slices. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until the cheese is crispy. Top with asiago and parsley and serve.
Get dressed up
Who says you have to be going out to show off your sparkliest, most eye-catching party outfit? Browse your closet for an outfit worthy of the camera. Pick out your fancy shoes, main character fit and fun accessories to get dressed up for the night. If you wear make-up, follow a New Year’s Eve make-up tutorial from Glamour magazine, YouTube or TikTok. 
After you and your roommates are all glammed up, it’s time to whip out the camera. Your apartment or house is now your photoshoot space. You can even create a photo backdrop with things like balloons and streamers. 
Pop champagne
This one’s a given, but you’ve got to time it right. Make sure to stock up on plenty of champagne this morning before you head into your celebratory night in. It’s way more exciting to pop the champagne as a marker of the new year than to plow through the bottles early in the night.
That being said, you’ll want to stock up on your household’s favorite seltzers, wine and liquor to get the party going early.
You could even dive into some 2020-themed drinking games to commemorate this chaotic year coming to a close. Try turning on any of the New Year’s Eve TV specials that will be airing on various cable channels like ABC and TBS and taking a shot or sip of your drink every time the pandemic, a celebrity’s death, the presidential election or civil unrest is mentioned. 
Celebrate as different countries ring in the new year
Watch fireworks from Sydney, Australia
You can tune into a livestream of the celebratory New Year’s Eve fireworks here.
Watch France’s New Year’s Eve show live from Paris
Stream the night’s festivities with English commentary here.
Watch Russia’s New Year’s Eve festivities 
For the first time in history, watch Russian New Year’s Eve festivities live from the Red Square on its state-sponsored TV network Perviy Kanal.
Watch fireworks from Dubai, United Arab Emirates 
Watch a firework show from the world’s tallest building located in Dubai here.
Watch the Times Square Ball Drop
As per tradition, make sure and have your TV tuned into ABC around 11 p.m. to watch as anticipation builds for the ball drop at midnight. Although there won’t be a giant crowd in Times Square to celebrate the drop, the tradition is still on schedule. You can tune in earlier if you want to catch live music performances by artists like Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Machine Gun Kelly.

Those who knew Kramer said she was committed to ensuring the best for students and always brought a spirit of generosity to her work and those around her.
Leila Kramer, the interim assistant director of Disability Support Services, died unexpectedly earlier this month. She was 52.
Kramer joined the DSS staff in 2016, helping students with their studies, organization skills and time management. A certified life coach, Kramer spent time developing workshops for students to succeed both within and beyond the DSS office.
Those who knew Kramer said she was committed to ensuring the best for students and always brought a spirit of generosity to her work and those around her.
Caroline Laguerre-Brown, the vice provost for diversity and inclusion, said DSS benefited from Kramer’s service through her dedication to caring for students.
“Leila was a passionate advocate for students,” she said in an email. “She inspired students and colleagues alike to be the best version of themselves.”
She said staff members feel the weight of Kramer’s passing, as officials put together “interim supports” and search for someone to fill the position she has held for several years and used to inspire the students she served.
“The DSS team is heartbroken over Leila’s passing,” she said. “They are like a family, and this is a terrible loss.”
Brown and Alisa Major, the interim director of DSS, emailed students with news of Kramer’s passing earlier this month and offered drop-in sessions with the Counseling and Psychological Support Office as a resource. They said the University’s CARE team is also available to support students impacted by Kramer’s passing.
“Leila was a compassionate professional who saw the work of supporting GW students as a vocation,” the email states. “She was deeply committed to ensuring that students with disabilities had equal access to educational opportunities. She worked tirelessly to advocate for students and did so with a warmth that made her colleagues appreciate having her as a partner.”
Terri West, the senior disability services associate at DSS, said she and Kramer fostered “a great friendship” over the roughly five years they knew each other. West said she remembers Kramer for her generosity and humor, noting memories like the two laughing together in the office and Kramer sharing a cake with her coworkers in celebration of Mardi Gras.
Aside from personal memories, West said Kramer’s ultimate commitment was to her students.
“Leila was dedicated to her DSS students,” she said in an email. “She went above and beyond to make sure they had access to all that was needed in their academic success. I cannot speak enough about her kind spirit and awesome qualities. Such a huge loss.”
Ben Freedman, a junior studying international affairs, said he met Kramer during his freshman year when he sought out help from DSS for managing his workload while coping with attention deficit disorder. Freedman said he met with Kramer for 30 minutes every Thursday to organize his homework and review upcoming assignments, and as a result, he eventually found himself preparing for presentations mentioned in his syllabi even before his professors mentioned them in class.
“She was extremely helpful and extremely patient with me, and she was extremely passionate with what she did,” he said. “She contributed positively to a lot of people’s lives within the GW DSS community and the GW community as a whole.”
Kramer always came into work with the same amount of enthusiasm, motivation and patience, Freedman said.
“The whole time it never felt like I was just work for her,” he said. “She was always patient with me and very helpful and caring.”
Freedman said Kramer, whom he notes as a grandmotherly figure, taught him two lessons during their time together – have patience and love what you do.
Kramer is survived by her father, Graham Kramer; his wife, Nell Kramer; and her sister, Sarah Kramer, according to her obituary.
