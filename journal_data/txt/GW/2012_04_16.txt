The men’s tennis team saved its best tennis for when it mattered most.
The Colonials entered the A-10 tournament as the fifth seed and began their path to the A-10 title competition by defeating La Salle 5-0 Friday. GW pulled off two upsets as it advanced in the competition, taking down No. 4 seeded Temple Friday 4-1, and surprising top-seeded Charlotte 4-2 in the semifinals Saturday to advance.
The Colonials faced a familiar foe in the finals, taking on Xavier, the team GW defeated last season to win the A-10 tournament. Echoing the previous year’s performance, the Colonials claimed the A-10 championship for the second straight season, earning an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament in the process.
“Xavier is always a tough opponent. But all of our opponents are tough opponents,” senior Ugur Atalay said. “Xavier, even though we beat them last year, we always know that they are tough and that they can play. [It’s a] good thing that we came through.”
Xavier began the day by nabbing the doubles point, putting GW in a one-point hole  entering singles competition. The Colonials regained ground when senior Richard Blumenfeld won at No. 6 singles, followed by sophomore Viktor Svensson and junior Alexander van Gils, who took No. 5 and No. 3 singles, respectively.
But Xavier rebounded with a victory at No. 4 singles, and topped freshman Francisco Dias at No. 1 singles, tying the contest. The day’s match and the conference title ultimately came down to Atalay, who has established a reputation as a clutch performer over his tenure at GW.
“If we are deadlocked at three-all and Ugur Atalay is playing in the deciding match, I do not doubt that he will win,” head coach Greg Munoz said.
After dropping his first set 3-6, Atalay stormed back to capture the second and third sets, 7-6 (5), 6-1. He concentrated on shaking off the pressure after dropping the first set, Atalay said, focusing instead on the promise of additional competition should the Colonials win the title.
He and Blumenfeld will extend their careers in NCAA tournament competition, and that was Atalay’s motivation as he took the court Sunday.
“I’m told that I handle it well, playing under pressure. I know myself. With too much pressure, I can’t play my best, so I try to not think about it.” Atalay said. “This year, being a senior made me feel totally different playing in the A-10 tournament. This could’ve been my last match ever, but luckily it’s not. I did not want to end my career here.”
After earning the No. 1 seed in the A-10 tournament for four straight seasons, GW was more of an underdog this year, entering postseason play as the fifth seed. The lower seeding meant the team didn’t earn a first-round bye, but GW remained focused.
As the A-10 grew stronger this season, the Colonials were often hampered by nagging injuries to various members of their squad.They went into every match confident, Blumenfeld said, a presence of mind that helped the team fight its way to its second straight title.
“We’ve overcome so much this season, battling injuries,” Blumenfeld said. “In our minds, we thought that we were the favorites every time. The other teams know what we are capable of, and injuries don’t really change that. Everybody came through for us because we all wanted to win.”
Munoz sees this year’s squad as his most resilient, calling it “our best team ever, I believe.”
While the Colonials were unable to make it past the first round of the tournament last season, falling to Duke, they’ve been given a second chance this year.
“One thing that I enjoy is making history. I don’t think that a fifth seed ever had a shot at winning the conference tournament in the past,” Munoz said. “We played with our hearts. We were almost down and out, but we just kept trying to figure out how to find a way.  We all contributed in some way or another and we made it happen.”

The first game GW dropped Sunday was a slugfest, with GW falling 8-0 to Massachusetts.
The second was a tight pitcher’s duel in which only one run had crossed the plate until Minutewomen senior pitcher Sara Plourde hit a homer just over the left field fence in the sixth, clinching a 2-0 Massachusetts victory.
It was Plourde’s fast, high-rising pitch that stumped the Colonials, as the team was unable to adjust for her breaking, shifting balls. As she stood on the mound against GW, Plourde proved why she currently leads the nation in strikeouts and holds the all-time A-10 record in that category.
“She definitely had some speed on her ball, and she had a whole lot of movement. She had a great rise ball that was really getting our batters,” senior pitcher Heidi Penna said.
Entering Sunday’s first contest against Massachusetts, the Colonials were riding a three-game win streak that had roots in six victories over GW’s previous seven games.
Plourde struck out 13 in the first game of the afternoon, setting herself up for her first no-hitter of the day. With GW unable to solve Plourde’s pitching arsenal, Massachusetts was free to concentrate on its offense, tallying eight runs over the game. The Colonials cycled through three pitchers: sophomore Courtney Martin, Penna and freshman Chelsea Pedley, before the game ended in the fifth innin because of the mercy rule.
“[Plourde’s] movement is unbelievable, and that combined with speed,” head coach Stacey Schramm said. “She’s got the most strikeouts in the country for a reason.”
When GW saw that Massachusetts would return Plourde to the mound for the second game of the afternoon, they rallied together, Penna said, cheering to stay focused and bring a new presence in the second contest. Schramm, aware the Colonials were staring down another tough battle at the plate, told her team to choose its pitches wisely.
“Other than making smart adjustments, we knew she was going to get tired, we talked about not swinging at the rise ball, not helping her out and we did,” Schramm said. “We still didn’t hit well in the second game, but we put the ball in play.”
The second contest of the day was more tightly contested at the first, Penna settling down to pitch a complete game after the Minutewomen scored in the first. She faced 28 batters, striking out two and allowing two runs on five hits. Though GW was able to put the ball in play more in the second game, Penna soon locked into a duel with Plourde, who struck out 12 Colonials.
“You just have to continue focusing as if it’s any other day,” Penna said. “You just have to stay focused on what you do. You can’t think about the other team.”
Its two victories against Rhode Island Friday and Saturday evened GW’s A-10 record at five, but dropping two to Massachusetts put the Colonials’ league tally below .500 to finish the weekend.

For three weeks this year, intimacy is becoming the pillar of Hawthorne Heights shows, as the rock band sheds its harder sound and embarks on an acoustic tour.
The four-member group sat with guitars in their laps Friday for 40 cross-legged fans on a carpeted floor in West Hall, playing the acoustic-only set, which featured a mix of their oldest and newest music.
An eclectic audience consisting mainly of students – joined by younger fans who brought their parents along – lined the floor as the band played its songs, rewritten for acoustic sets, introducing an entirely new element to their tunes.
“You’ve got to think on your toes a lot more during a show like this, because it’s a lot harder to get people to sing along, because they aren’t used to hearing the songs this way,” lead singer JT Woodruff said.
Woodruff said audience members Friday approached him, admitting their surprise at the venue – a Mount Vernon Campus room with fluorescent classroom lighting, as opposed to the typical dimly lit bar.
Despite the unusual atmosphere, Woodruff said he loves doing smaller shows, as he joked with the audience, never taking his bandmates or himself too seriously.
“You can hear every single mistake you make when you play acoustic, and I have to sing so much louder because of how naturally everything just kind of sounds empty,” he said.
Although Hawthorne Heights fans spilled their support and love Friday, cheering, clapping and singing along, the idea behind the band’s newest album, “Hate,” is negativity, Woodruff said.
He added that the inspiration for the new album came from how “shitty people can be to each other for no reason.”
Citing cyber bullying and anonymous Internet comments – mainly on music blogs – as inspiration for the album, Woodruff said he does not understand why online space is used as a forum for bickering.
“The album is about how you can be anonymously negative and feel no repercussions from it,” Woodruff said. “But actually, life should be very positive.”
The takeaway from such a heavy topic, he said, is for listeners to “grow up and relax.”
“Hate” is one of a trilogy of albums, released in August 2011. The next two will revolve around different themes, Woodruff said. He declined to release what the new themes would be.
The student organization We Book Shows brought the touring band to GW for its final show of the year. Sophomore Matt Kostman, a member of We Book Shows, said Hawthorne Heights offered to perform at the best price tag of any other band they approached, solidifying the deal.
“We all decided that this acoustic tour would work best for us,” Kostman said.

Three students slipped into ball gowns and lived like queens last week.
Instead of running through the typical student schedule of classes and work, seniors Amy Brickman, Pierron Tackes and Lauren Kalina attended events like meet-and-greet ceremonies at the Department of State and gathered at a tea party as winners of the weeklong Cherry Blossom Princess Educational and Cultural Exchange Program.
Brickman, Tackes and Kalina represented their home states of Pennsylvania, Nevada and Missouri, respectively, as three of 54 Cherry Blossom Princesses in the 64th annual event sponsored by the National Conference of State Societies.
“I knew this would be a great experience and make a really great story one day,” Brickman said. “The potential to win a trip to Japan was also helpful.”
The contest’s rules require that princess hopefuls have a high school diploma and range from 19 to 24 years of age.
With a jam-packed schedule for the week, the princesses began each day at 7 a.m., their schedules not ending until the early morning hours. Tuesday, they began their day touring National Postal Museum, after which they visited children at the Smithsonian Early Enrichment Center and stayed for lunch, visited the National Museum of American History and went to Bread for the City. They then talked with the Women’s Bar Association, Bright Beginnings and Mary House in Northeast D.C. before they finally went back to their hotel to freshen up and attend a Taste of the States Princess Coronation Reception at Ft. Myer.
“I was excited about the whole program and what we would be able to do, and thought that in my last semester it was something I could really afford to do,” Tackes said, referring to her lax class attendance last week.
Despite their rigorous schedule, some events allowed the girls to blow off steam. Earlier, the princesses were invited to eat and play with children at the Kennedy Institute and the Smithsonian Early Enrichment Center, something they said was a fun break from the more regimented structure of their busy routine. 
“I was the crazy girl who was rolling around in the grass and not acting like a princess,” Tackes said, adding the children had the funniest stories to share with the princesses.
They also received backstage tours of the Kennedy Center and sampled traditional cuisine at the Thai embassy.
Brickman said the Kennedy Center tour was her personal favorite event.
“The tour was really cool, because we got to stand on the main stage, which was really exciting. We got to see the tech area, underground, three different stages and go in the president’s box,” Brickman said.
As a senior, Tackes felt this was her last chance to participate in an event like this – something she could cross off her bucket list.
“As a senior getting ready to go out into that scary place that is the real world, it was so encouraging to hear that we should pursue what makes us happy, despite the roadblocks,” Tackes said, reflecting on words of advice from people she met throughout the week.
The U.S. Cherry Blossom Queen, from Maryland this year, won a two-week trip to Japan, and past winners have visited the Diet of Japan, the country’s legislature.

Many students see career advising as logging onto a website, uploading a resume and praying that some employer on GWork will notice.
But with the University’s ongoing career services overhaul, students can hopefully look forward to a more constructive process.
One of the major questions the Career Services Task Force will have to address is the relationship between academic and career advising. The GW School of Business has an interconnected model, in which career and academic advisers work alongside one another. The Elliott School of International Affairs has a more informal approach, in which a career adviser spends several hours a week in the advising office to answer questions from students.
As the Career Services Task Force debates how to balance the different roles of academic and career advisers, it should adopt a model similar to that of ESIA.
But it’s not as simple as just assigning two different sets of advisers. It is critical for the Career Services Task Force to strike a balance when defining the roles of academic and career advisers.
With the influx of new advisers, there will inherently be more collaboration and interaction between academic and career specialists. And while each college will have somewhat of a distinct system, there should always be a clear division between the two.
At a time when interdisciplinary studies are becoming more prevalent in academics, students need academic advisers who will be able to help facilitate their exploration into different fields of study.
While academic advisers should certainly be aware of career opportunities for students, their primary focus should be to help students develop effective four-year academic plans.
Academic advisers should be knowledgeable about courses offered throughout the University. For example, students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science should be made aware of a digital design course in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.
By keeping the advising models separate, students would not feel pressure to translate every course they sign up for into a career opportunity.
Having this division between academic and career advisers would provide students the freedom to craft an advising system that works best for them.
Under the new model, students shouldn’t feel pressured or constrained by also having career services advisers. If students are already comfortable with their academic adviser, then they can look to them specifically for advice about academics and beyond. And the same goes for those who feel comfortable working with a career mentor rather than an academic one. The University must allow for sufficient flexibility within the new system, as students should be able to retain control over their specific academic and career choices.

Trust.
That is what the Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education wants from students. To rid the office of its reputation as the alcohol police, its leadership is asking students what they really think.
The listening tour, which will begin Tuesday, will include talks with specific student populations – a new approach to town hall-style meetings that administrators hope will allow students to voice their concerns with the center’s operations and offer suggestions for its future.
Assistant Dean of Students Tara Pereira expects face-to-face interaction with students will help make the office more functional and approachable.
“I also want to make sure we have time in the listening tour for things that are not policy related, but are more programmatically related, or health and safety campaign-related,” Pereira said.
Alexis Janda became the center’s new associate director in January, after the office lacked senior leadership for nearly a semester. Janda wants to hear students talk about how visiting CADE can become a more inviting experience, rather than an obligation resulting from disciplinary action.
“I would like to have the impact of making CADE a true resource center where students feel comfortable coming in and asking those questions,” Janda said.
The tour mirrors Pereira’s efforts last year to aggregate feedback when Student Judicial Services was restructured into two bodies: the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the Office of Civility and Community Standards.
CADE, a preventative body responsible for publicizing the risks of alcohol and drug abuse, also serves several administrative functions, including on-campus event registration and Responsible Alcohol Management training for students.
“I don’t think that listening tour was hugely successful in that we didn’t have a lot of people attend the sessions,” Pereira said, adding that around 30 students attended the half-dozen more generalized sessions last year. She hopes the more targeted outreach will draw more participation.
Pereira is applying a concentrated approach to the CADE tour by targeting specific student groups and organizations at each town hall – including undergraduates, graduates, Greeks and student leaders – as well as soliciting private comments via e-mail through her “TellTara” address.
CADE staff also plans to meet individually with international students and veterans, house staff, and faculty and staff – to learn students’ current perceptions of the office and what they believe it can do better in the future.
Pereira said the reassessment will likely result in renaming the office to account for its growing responsibilities, such as more violence prevention education and efforts to support students recovering from substance addictions.
“Because CADE’s services are expanding, its name needs to reflect those services better,” Pereira said.
Pereira said the listening tour would also serve to educate students about specific regulations – such as ambiguity regarding the Good Samaritan policy, which grants amnesty to students who report a peer’s alcohol overdose – and CADE’s efforts to promote bystander intervention, through campaigns such as Be Wiser and Living in the Green.
Originally slated for February, the tour was rescheduled to allow Janda to settle into her new role with CADE. But Pereira said students have already voiced several concerns with the center’s current policies, citing recurring issues like mandatory event registration and Responsible Alcohol Management training.
“We have been listening, we have been listening for all of these years,” Pereira said. “We have written down what it is that students have problems with.”

The Faculty Senate voted Friday to overhaul its model for divvying up seats, giving bigger schools more voices in the lobbying group.
The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, the GW School of Business and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences will each gain two senators – an expansion that will give them more weight in faculty governance. Each of those schools will have 11, five and five senators, respectively.
Most other schools will also gain one senator as the faculty group proportionally lines up with its ratio of tenure-track faculty. The body will swell from 29 to 40 tenure-track faculty starting in the fall of 2013 if the proposal gains approval from the Faculty Assembly and the Board of Trustees in October.
“By expanding the size of the senate and making it more proportional to the size of [each] school, you would get a greater diversity of opinions from different departments in the schools,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor who chairs the senate’s Committee on Professional Ethics and Academic Freedom.
The resolution, which passed 14-6, was a compromise that will give each school at least two senators after faculty debated whether a strict senatorial model or a proportional model would help restore the senate’s influence and inject it with more diversity.
Wilmarth said by increasing the size of the senate, the body could engage faculty from different disciplines, since 52 of 71 total departments lack representation.
Kimberly Acquaviva, an assistant professor of nursing, maintained that the adopted proposal – which was heralded by senators in the University’s largest school, Columbian College – would marginalize smaller schools and make senate representatives less diverse by race and gender.
“I have grave concerns,” Acquaviva said. “Our three smallest schools here have the highest percentage of female faculty. Our largest school has the highest percentage of white faculty. The impact, if we vote on that as a faculty assembly as a whole, it may unfortunately tilt our diversity in a direction we don’t want to go.”
About 20 percent of the senate is female, while the women make up about 40 percent of the entire University faculty base. The School of Nursing – which has all female faculty – the Graduate School of Education and Human Development and the School of Public Health and Health Services have the highest percentage of female faculty at GW.
This year, the Faculty Senate has three senators from six schools and nine senators from Columbian College. The School of Nursing, which was established in 2010, gained its first senator in September, while the School of Public Health and Health Services and the Elliott School of International Affairs have two each, because they are the University’s next newest schools.
The adopted plan defeated a pitch to allocate seats based on a strict senatorial model, giving three senators to nine of GW’s schools, while the Columbian College would maintain nine representatives – three for each of the school’s divisions: humanities, social sciences and mathematical and physical sciences.
Michael Castleberry, the chairman of the executive committee of the Faculty Senate, said he did not think the change would affect the way the senate operates, because senators rarely form voting blocs by school.
Presentations about ongoing University initiatives like the strategic plan at meetings this year have been met with little resistance from senate members. The body last clashed with administrators over funding plans for the Science and Engineering Hall and the shuffling of parking options during the building’s construction.
Professor of medicine Gary Simon recalled when Columbian College professors and engineering professors locked horns over the $275-million building’s funding, adding that the adopted proposal could have made a difference when Columbian College faculty spoke out against paying for it with University debt in 2010.
“When it does come down to things that affect one school versus the other, we’re not exactly all in lockstep. There is an argument for having a little bit of one [model] and a little bit of the other.”

Where: 1207 19th St., NW
Cover: No
Carded: Yes
Happy Hour: Monday through Friday, 3 to 7 p.m., $1 off all bottled beer, drafts, signature whiskey cocktails
Bar Bells:
Our Bar Belle roams around D.C. reviewing bars as she sees fit – if she can see straight after visiting them.
If you’re in the mood for a stiff whiskey drink only a quick jaunt away from campus, Irish Whiskey Public House is a top choice.
I won’t pretend to know what authentic Irish culture looks like, but this place claims to be just that. The three levels have a distinct pub feel – minus the grime – and the menu offers Irish dishes, Irish and non-Irish draft and bottled beers and plenty of its namesake.
In light of my lack of knowledge regarding all things authentically Irish, I should also disclose that I don’t actually like whiskey. At all. This is one of my girly drinking tendencies, and the need to overcome it was part of the reason for my Irish Whiskey mission.
The whiskey list was long, and boasted several varieties and brands like Bushmills, Connemara, Tullamore Dew, Millars, Powers and of course, Jameson. There were also less common names, like Knappogue Castle, that I’m sure have a home in the hearts of whiskey lovers. The prices of Irish whiskey ranged from $6 to $300, with the pricier options including rare Irish whiskey and single malt Scotch whiskey selections.
Not wanting to take my experiment too far, a glass of dry whiskey was out of the question.
Instead I opted for the menu of signature cocktails – all $10. First came the Jameson Julep – with Jameson, fresh mint, simple syrup and club soda. If you want a drink that allows you to taste all the alcohol, this is your winner. The other ingredients did little to hide the whiskey taste, but I drank it nonetheless. I tried another route with the Ginger Flower – Michael Collins whiskey, St. Germaine and ginger ale, which gave me hope that whiskey wasn’t all bad. It proved a great choice for a tasty drink that’s not too sweet.
I took my night of adventure further by ordering the Whirlaway – Jameson, peach, fresh-squeezed orange juice, grenadine and club soda. My love for rum punch made this a perfect match, as it was basically the same concoction with whiskey.
Late on a weeknight, the crowd was mostly middle-aged and tame, although a large group of rowdy 20-somethings did breeze through and cheer on a rugby team on the television while pounding back shots.
While I might not be back for happy hour – $1 off a $10 cocktail isn’t exactly a steal – I certainly will remember Irish Whiskey as a place to cultivate my newfound whiskey acceptance with a side of friendly conversation.
