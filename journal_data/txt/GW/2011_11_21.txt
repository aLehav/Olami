What are you thankful for this Thanksgiving? Here’s The Hatchet’s monthly wrap-up of what we’re thankful and not so thankful for.
Gelman’s new entrance
Let’s face it: Hardly anyone wants to go to Gelman Library. And when you go down the stairs into Gelman’s dark and gloomy entrance, you really just want to turn around and walk away. But the University’s projected redesign to the Gelman entrance, which will be positioned in Kogan Plaza, will hopefully make it a more welcoming space. With this new entrance, students will only start to feel depressed when they actually sit down to study, not before they enter the building.
Senior Safeway closing 
Despite the protests of local residents, Safeway Grocery in the Watergate Hotel will close its doors Dec. 3. No matter how depressing and gray the “Senior Safeway” actually looked inside, students and locals went to the store to buy brand-name grocery products. It’ll be a shame to bid adieu to familiar food brands like Kraft and Kellogg’s, and we’ll have to make sure that our wallets are a little thicker when we go to Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods.
Attendance at games
GW’s athletic teams have achieved notable successes throughout the year, and students are showing up in impressive numbers to support them. Students stormed the field when the men’s soccer team clinched a berth to the Atlantic-10 tournament and head coach George Lidster earned his 200th win. Colonial Army was out in full force in the men’s home opener victory against University of Maryland, Eastern Shore, and the women’s game against Virginia Tech was well-attended, as fans watched the team battle and ultimately fall in the hard-fought game. Hopefully students will continue to support the athletic teams as the winter season begins to enter full swing.
Increased safety measures
The University has responded to a number of troubling security infractions this year with some notable increases in safety measures. University Police Department officers will be stationed in some upperclassman residence halls at night, a laudable move to help thwart piggybacking. In addition, the University now is able to alert students of ongoing threats via a safety and security text messaging system. Living in a city is exciting, but it also comes with some dangers, and these improvements will help students feel more secure on campus.
Farewell to The Frog 
The University plans to implement the next phase of its campus plan, and while it will be sad to see Thai Place, Mehran Restaurant and Panda Café go, the most tragic casualty is that Froggy Bottom Pub will be shut down. At this school, which too often laments a lack of spirited GW spaces, Froggy’s cheap pitchers of beer and greasy food are a flocking ground for students. Froggy Bottom, and its owner Hien, our mother away from home, will be sorely missed if it is unable to relocate close to campus.
Bad News Bears in the volleyball playoffs
The Intramural Volleyball League’s playoffs will begin after Thanksgiving at HelWell, and The Hatchet’s team, the Bad News Bears, is still without a win. Fortunately, the tournament’s forgiving format allows everyone to make the playoffs. So the Bad News Bears will march into the playoffs with a defeated record, searching for our first victory that did not come from the opposing team’s forfeit. Go Bad News Bears!

We are surrounded with the commercialization that accompanies Christmas, from the festive red cups from Starbucks branded with “Let’s Merry,” to dancing Santa Clauses and bags of red, green and white M&Ms at CVS.
With all the garlands and carols playing, Thanksgiving – a time for being thankful and appreciating what we have – can be lost in the celebration of the impending Christmas season.
So let’s put aside the Christmas merriment for a little while. What the University needs is a school-wide day of service for Thanksgiving, an in-depth conference devoted to discussing homelessness and the problems facing the impoverished.
The Center for Civic Engagement and Service already hosts a multitude of events throughout National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness week. Student-organized events include service opportunities across the city, a poetry slam, a homelessness panel, hunger banquet, a canned food drive and a hunger walk.
But like the two other days of service the University holds – Sept. 11 and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day – Thanksgiving is an excellent opportunity for a University-wide day dedicated to volunteering.
Having a designated day of service will also encourage students who are not involved in student organizations or who do not typically have time to participate in service activities.
There’s no denying that turnout for the University-wide days of service is greater than student organization-run events. Publicity on campus for the events is huge, house staff members encourage their residents to take part and some professors even allow classes on those days to be optional.
The University could host former or current homeless individuals willing to share their stories. While there is an opportunity to hear directly from former or current homeless individuals throughout National Hunger and Homelessness week, having this event open to all of GW would only enhance its power and significance.
Given that we are a student body that interacts directly with the homeless on a daily basis, this would provide the entire community with the chance to listen to the unheard voices of the people we see every day.
We saw a promising glimmer of what a Thanksgiving Day of Service could be with the National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness week. But what this laudable student-organized week showed us is that, with University backing, an even more impressive day dedicated to serving others is possible.
After Thanksgiving, the national culture turns to one of consumerism and excessive spending. So while we are still focused on gratitude and appreciation, we should take the next step and have a University-wide day of service.
We can give more than thanks this holiday.

The opinions page of The Hatchet rarely gives the University a break.
But the Thanksgiving season is upon us, and it just so happens to be one of my favorite holidays – not because I really like the change of seasons or because my mother makes an exceptionally good turkey dinner.
It’s because Thanksgiving is the one time of the year when we can take a break from the hectic nature of life and appreciate the things we care about most. So I will defect from the typical opinions page critiques to dedicate this column to the things about our University that I think we can all be grateful for – even if that means being grateful for some faults.
First, to the administration: Thank you for not being perfect. At every turn, there is another reason not to like this place. Whether it’s a brilliant adjunct professor who knows everything – except for how to teach – or the University’s bureaucratic system that hinders well-intended employees from being good at their jobs, GW definitely has its faults.
I guess, after all, this is a good life lesson. When we graduate and enter the real world, a lot is going to suck. Many of us will join the work force and be a part of major corporations that will be rich with hierarchy and red tape. And it’ll be on our shoulders to fix it.
At least most of us will have had four years of dealing with administration – along with its imperfections and oversights – to know how to best be engaged and positively make changes.
To the student body: Thanks for being weird. We truly are something unique. If we ever looked up from our BlackBerrys we might see just how diverse our student body is.
Few students at GW are from the District, so the student body is comprised of people from all 50 states and numerous other countries. And every student brings a story – and his or her own quirks – to campus. Whether it’s a Midwestern freshman teaching her roommate what “pop” is, or a fratstar upperclassman explaining to his hipster classmate why V-necks and cargo shorts are unacceptable, this student body is pretty weird.
But we are weird in the best way possible, weird in the way that we’re all different from one another, and that’s what makes it work. After all, when we venture through life, not everyone will look the same as us or appreciate the same things as we do. The student body here is preparing us for all the strange people we’ll meet down the road.
To the community: Thanks for having a “sorry I’m not sorry” attitude. We live in the hustle and bustle of a great American city. Our weekends are packed with some of the hottest clubs and best museums a student could ask for.
And you better believe the community takes advantage of it every minute. We’re loud, we can be a little obnoxious and sure, we take over the city at times. But we’re not about to apologize for that, because we’re young and we’re thirsty for new experiences.
And we feel the need to tell everyone in the city, from the D.C. natives to the young professionals in Dupont Circle to the tourists looking for the Foggy Bottom Metro stop.
So thanks for all you do, GW. But I’ll be honest, while my mother’s turkey dinner may not be that great, it’s a hell of a lot better than J Street. So the only thing I care about right now is that.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
