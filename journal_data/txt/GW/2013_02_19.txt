Applications for GW’s affinity housing program dropped 67 percent after the University announced this spring that only registered student organizations could be part of the program.
Thirty-three groups applied for the housing option – a drop from about 100 groups last year, GW Housing Programs Director Seth Weinshel said.
The themed housing option boomed after it first launched three years ago, prompting GW to tighten restrictions this year by only including registered organizations and upping the number of participants allowed per group.
Affinity groups next year will live in Fulbright Hall, The Dakota, Mitchell Hall and Guthridge Hall. While the average group will swell to 24 members – up from 11 last year – the affinity housing population will shrink by 25 percent.
A total of 600 students will participate next year.
Weinshel said the smaller size will not affect the program, which is slated to expand over the next decade as a flagship student life component of the University’s 10-year strategic plan.
“It doesn’t matter how many people, if those groups are living together and are building great community amongst themselves, affinity will only continue to grow over time,” he said.
The plan will also increase its faculty-in-residence and study abroad options. Six floors in GW’s newest residence hall, known colloquially as “the superdorm,” will have floor plans designed to house up to 20 students who will share a kitchen and living room.
Freshman Meg Glavey said the new requirements weren’t made clear enough to students applying for the program. She said she and 15 friends who happen to be involved with Campaign GW decided to apply together.
“It was hard to establish ourselves as a student organization because of the stricter rules,” Glavey said.

Part-time professor Caitlin Schrein wants the work of her graduate anthropology students to go beyond an audience of academics who read leather-bound journals and obscure research papers.
Schrein, who leads a graduate course called “Public Understanding of Science,” teaches aspiring scientists to relay complicated research findings for laypeople – a concept the University wants its own established researchers to start putting into action.
“Public understanding of science in general is not just about trying to persuade or convince people that what you think as a scientist is right,” Schrein said. “Scientists have to be able to effectively communicate science for the betterment of society generally.”
GW’s nearly final 10-year plan, which is marked with millions of dollars to improve the University’s research status, will also encourage researchers to more aggressively convey their work to the public. Schrein said this was an unusual focus for a university.
“This is a pressing national need,” Provost Steven Lerman said. “Fewer and fewer people in the general public I think understand the nature of scientific research and its value to society, partly because many of the research areas are complicated.”
The University will look to push back against this ignorance, according to the plan, by increasing researchers’ work with GW’s public relations arm. The office hired Lisa Van Pay, a former spokeswoman for the National Science Foundation, two months ago as director of research communications.
“I think it will make the case why research is so important,” Lerman said. “Research and development is one of the great engines of the American economy. I think it’s because – perhaps – because we in science and technology have not explained that well, perhaps it’s been undervalued.”
Murray Loew, a professor of engineering, said he teaches his students to have a 20-second elevator speech – as well as an hour-long presentation that includes the technical details – prepared about their projects.
“The point is to focus on the importance and not the details,” Loew said. “ ‘How is this useful? What will the benefits be in the future?’ and so on.”
Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said executing that communications pitch also helps the University’s reputation if more people view GW as a place where beneficial research occurs.
He pointed to recent anthropology research about the origins of barefoot running, which earned GW a mention in a New York Times article.
But the emphasis on public communication of science can also water down research, said Chet Sherwood, an associate professor of anthropology. He said researchers need to strike between correctly reporting the science and over-simplifying it.
“It’s our obligation, I think, to be able to very clearly try to explain the significance of our research. But science can be bogged down in rather technical terminology, and there are always caveats to being able to generalize your findings,” he said.

The University will not refund hundreds of students who were forced to pay for a full year of GW’s health insurance even though they will graduate three months before the plan expires.
As part of a mandatory insurance plan, about 4,000 students were automatically charged $2,200, plus additional thousands for dependents, last July. Senior Associate Dean of Students Mark Levine said last week that it is not possible to refund graduating students for the extra months of coverage, despite backlash.
“Many students continue to use the health insurance benefits locally or at home, including internationally, during the summer months,” Levine said in an email.
The insurance fees applied to international, medical, public health and nursing students, many of whom say they plan to leave the U.S. after graduation.
International graduate student Shashwat Gautam said the extra three months come out to $518 per student, on top of charges for dependents like wives or children.
Gautam and Shirley Hsieh, both members of the Student Association, have lobbied for GW to modify its mandatory health care policy since last summer, when thousands of students saw charges on their bills even if they already had health care coverage.
Gautam and Hsieh created a 17-page report last semester outlining changes for the program, the cornerstone of which was a refund. About 1,800 students opted out of the plan last semester after proving to Aetna that they had a previous insurance plan. About 2,300 students are still covered by the plan, University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said last week.
She said she is not sure of how many students on the plan will graduate because not everyone has applied for graduation. Last year, more than 1,000 medical, public health and nursing students graduated, including hundreds of international students.
Second-year graduate MBA student Fatih Saglik, said he is “really pissed off,” about the coverage. He said he will return home to Turkey in May, but must continue paying $1,381 for himself and an additional $3,867 for his seven-months pregnant wife.
“I don’t get why they make me buy health insurance for the summer, from which I won’t be benefiting at all,” Saglik said. He said his wife is due in April and the costlier coverage will make it difficult to keep the new family afloat under a tight budget.
Siddharth Dugar, a second-year MBA student from India, said that while Aetna has a branch in his home country, it would be cheaper to purchase from a provider back home.
“It’s really expensive, and we don’t have the option,” Dugar said.
Gautam said because it has been six months since he submitted his initial proposal to alter the health plans, he has “lost hope” that his other recommendations, including establishing an Aetna contact point on campus for students and offering alternate affordable packages, will ever gain ground.
“After putting in so much effort, with such an elaborate document and meeting with every single senior administrator, and having them promise, it’s pretty disappointing,” Gautam said.
Gautam tried reaching out to administrators via email at the end of January, but said he never received a direct response. He was also in contact with Student Association President Ashwin Narla, who agreed to address these concerns at his next meeting with the administration.
In the last few months, the University has extended the deadline to apply for a waiver, expanded the exemption criteria for these waivers, and increased communication efforts, Levine said.
But Gautam said increased communication is not enough. He added that the University failed to fully explain the policy to the student body, and after he setup an email account to answer insurance questions last semester, more than 100 students reached out to him.
“We did the work that Student Health Service should be doing for students,” Gautam said.

Correction appended
GW will spend several million dollars to gut and replace kitchens in Fulbright Hall this summer, part of a five-year plan to renovate outdated residence halls.
About 75 kitchens in Fulbright will receive fresh countertops and cabinetry as part of the renovation process, with some rooms also receiving new appliances. Rooms in the 66-year-old building were last upgraded in 2009 with a paint job.
“A lot of times we look at where you can get the most bang for your buck. Fulbright has 225 residents, and in terms of looking at places with outdated facilities like kitchens, it’s one of the bigger buildings and makes the most sense to renovate,” Director of GW Housing Programs Seth Weinshel said.
Next on the list to renovate are International House, JBKO, Francis Scott Key and Guthridge halls.
University spokeswoman Taylor Tibbetts could not pinpoint the exact cost of the renovations, but said the cost is less than last year’s $2.5 million upgrade in Munson Hall. GW set aside $4 million for residence hall renovations last year.
The Board of Trustees will officially price the project in the capital budget in May.
Several Fulbright residents say the upgrades are overdue, citing drainage problems and recurring cockroach problems.
Sophomore Emilia Totzeva said she doesn’t feel her room is worth the $9,250 rate, and said she has found cockroaches in cabinets several times this year. She also said some of her appliances do not work properly.
“It’ll be great to see the next batch of residents with newer cabinets and microwaves,” she said. “As of now, the sinks are dirty, and the drains used to clog basically every single day. When we open our refrigerator, our freezer opens, and when we open our freezer, our refrigerator opens.”
Another resident, sophomore Diana Clokey, said her oven does not work well, baking only in some places instead of all around the pan, and said the sinks’ drains “easily clog.”
The halls up next for renovations are the oldest on campus. Over the past 16 years, the University has built five residence halls, including Philip Amsterdam, Potomac and South halls, 1959 E Street and Ivory Tower.
And when the University begins construction on the $130 million “superdorm,” this summer, three more halls built in the middle of the 20th century will be completely revamped.
Few halls have seen building-wide upgrades in recent years, like the water, heating and air conditioning upgrades in Francis Scott Key Hall in 2009. Lounges in Building JJ, Strong Hall and The West End were also renovated that year.
The University spent more than $3 million on upgrades to Guthridge, Mitchell, City and The Aston halls in 2012.
This article was updated Feb. 19, 2013 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the renovations would cost an amount similar to the $2.5 million spent on Munson Hall in 2012. The renovations will cost less than that amount. We regret this error.

The English department is looking to build a stronger cadre of professors in disability studies – a relatively new field that looks at how people with disabilities perceive and are perceived in society.
The English department will hire an associate or full-time professor in for the cross-disciplinary field that spans several departments, including education, law, literature and public policy. Disability studies has taken root in the English department over the last few years, though it is not yet offered as a major or minor.
That could change soon, department chair Robert McRuer said. He added that he hopes another speciality hire will build momentum for disability studies at GW and entice more graduate students to the program.
He said that while there are other professors who are interested in disability studies, he is targeting a top scholar to lift the department above its competitors.
“It will make us really one of the two English departments in the country that are known for that kind of interdisciplinary work on disability – impairment of the body,” McRuer, who specializes in disability studies, said. “It’s kind of difficult to understand how important that will be in terms of our national profile in that field, which is a really emerging field. It’s also one that students tend to love.”
The field is akin to feminism, and it looks to dig deeper than common stereotypes and metaphors about disabilities in history and literature, McRuer said.
Jeffrey Cohen, an English professor, said the department, which has several scholars on disability studies, has put a lot of energy into the cultural field.
“A way to think about this is for those of us who were not born disabled – if we live long enough, there will come a time in our lives where we become disabled. It’s not that a disability sets a person off in one particular way,” he said. “It’s a part of the human experience.”
Disability studies gained momentum at GW six years ago with its first cross-discipline symposium. The next conference, which will likely take place next spring, is in the planning stages.
GW is currently one of the only English departments in the country with a teaching slot for disability studies. Other universities that have shown interest in the field include Emory, University of Chicago, Georgetown and Corcoran College of Art and Design.
It could become a minor at GW “down the road,” McRuer said, tying into the University’s interdisciplinary focus, highlighted in the strategic plan and evidenced by new minors like sustainability.
Columbian College of Arts and Sciences has had two students graduate with majors in disability studies in recent years because they were able to create their own interdisciplinary degree, McRuer said.

Clarification appended
The Graduate School of Political Management wants students to know it can help them thrive in a culture of partisan sniping, shifting its marketing focus after a year of declining student interest.
Director Mark Kennedy, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who took over last January, said the school will highlight lessons in campaigning and legislative dealing rather than policy.
Applications to the school dipped 22 percent last year, pushing enrollment down by 14 percent. The decline came after a year of stagnant enrollment following two years of about 35 percent gains.
In previous promotion efforts, headed by three marketing heads in five years, the school would sometimes advertise itself as “nonpartisan,” Kennedy said.
“We [called] ourselves nonpolitical. We are not nonpolitical. Why would you come to GSPM if you aren’t political, if you weren’t partisan,” Kennedy said. “We don’t care what policy you’re trying to advance; we’re here to teach you how to advance it.”
Kennedy said he is trying to reach more potential students who want to learn the ins and outs of campaign strategy, speechwriting, polling, PR and new media. He will travel to Utah, California and North Carolina to recruit, a role his predecessors did not have.
“He got the mandate to be much more visible,” Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said.
GSPM, housed in the College of Professional Studies, is one of the University’s smallest schools. The marketing campaign – a new website and brochure – will launch this month.
Kennedy has personally pushed to make the school more visible by blogging for both sides of the political spectrum: FoxNews.com and The Huffington Post.
The former conservative congressman, who was in the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007, said becoming the director of a partisan but “all-encompassing” school has been “a learning experience for me as well, because the terminology that you use cannot wittingly be red or blue.”
Kennedy voted with his party 91 percent of the time, according to a Washington Post congressional database. He reached across the aisle to support a ban on cruel treatment of detainees in 2005, but voted to pass a constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriage in two failed attempts in 2004 and 2006.
Unsteady leadership prior to Kennedy’s arrival last year might have also derailed recruitment efforts. The school saw 18 months of faculty strife, interim leaders and internal debates over its trajectory. Its acceptance rate also crept up to two-thirds from 60 percent last year. Just one of the 23 applicants to a legislative affairs program, which are narrowed down in a U.S. Army-GSPM partnership, was rejected last year.
“I think the transition nature of the leadership impacted it. There was a lack of clear focus on reaching out every day and telling our story,” Kennedy said. “I’m not sure if we just relied on word of mouth but I still find people at GW that don’t know that GSPM is here.”
Kennedy has planned over the last year to add more full-time professors to the school’s “skeletal” faculty core and improve its research portfolio.
Maltzman said enrollment also might have fallen last year because it was election season, which would have put potential GSPM students out on the road with campaigns.
The College of Professional Studies will now control marketing efforts for its umbrella school, which has resulted in the sharing of talents and expertise as well as more streamlined operations leading to efficiencies,” Dean Ali Eskandarian said in an email.
The college hired this month Jonathan Akman, a new senior recruitment and enrollment specialist, to focus on boosting student outreach.
“There’s a renewed enthusiasm here,” Akman, an alumnus, said. “There are a lot of institutions where politics is taught, but the applied tenant is what makes this school unique.”

The Hatchet reported that 23 out of 24 applicants were accepted to the Graduate School of Political Management’s legislative affairs program. This is true, but the program is actually a partnership between GSPM and the U.S. Army. The army narrows the candidate pool down from hundreds of applicants and the school picks the top students that the army recommends.

Student space was a focus for Student Association executives last year. It has been the primary focus of the student leadership this year. And it is going to be the central tenet of nearly every SA candidate’s platform for the upcoming year.
The debate over this issue isn’t ending anytime soon. But Provost Steven Lerman and Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz wrote a patronizing public response Feb. 11 to the cry for more space, essentially denying the calls to turn the third floor of the Marvin Center into a student hub.
Instead, they argued, student space will be incorporated into new campus construction projects like the Science and Engineering Hall and the “superdorm.”
“We believe the best approach is to integrate student spaces into our new buildings and renovations, and this is the approach we have been pursuing.”
While it is reassuring that administrators are at least including more student space in future projects, the letter sent a message to students that their input isn’t a priority.
Students obviously have valuable insight when it comes to issues like campus space. The Marvin Center is supposedly GW’s student union, but the University has traded both the old Hippodrome bowling alley and the wingery on the fifth floor for more office space. And in response to more than 4,000 signatures on a petition to the Board of Trustees to open up more student space to create a greater sense of community, administrators have virtually turned their backs.
For any meaningful conversation, student ideas must be taken into account. The whole purpose of the SA is to take the pulse of the student body and lobby on behalf of the average Colonial. But these student leaders can only do so much when administrators won’t meet them halfway. Student feedback, especially from the SA, can complement the administration’s plans and initiatives.
Students’ concerns should not be brushed off. Collaboration is necessary in planning the future of campus. Universities exist for students, and their feedback should hold weight.
The administration’s opposition to student input puts an end to any SA lobbying efforts on this hallmark issue, which is frustrating, given that collaboration between the student representatives and GW officials has a led to past successes.
In the 2009-2010 academic school year, former SA President Julie Bindleglass and Executive Vice President Jason Lifton pushed the conversation about renovating Gelman Library. And then in May 2011, the board allocated $16 million to upgrading the aging building.
It is essential that the University remain receptive to student concerns, instead of writing a passive letter of dismissal.

Imagine two scenarios: one in which you are standing in a courtroom in front of a judge accusing your hall mate of stealing your phone, and one in which you are accusing your professor. As the victim, you would expect to retain the same rights while on trial regardless of the status of the person you’re accusing.
But in the confidentiality subsection of GW’s interim sexual harassment policy, there is a double standard for how the University treats students as compared to faculty and staff.
Thankfully, the University is in the process of changing this and other parts of the sexual harassment policy – and for good reason.
The interim policy states that a victim can remain anonymous when accusing another student, but not when the accused is a faculty member. That’s a problem considering one of the main purposes of the policy is to protect students who have been victimized and to help them feel as comfortable as possible if they choose to come forward.
It is critical that the plans to change this egregious double standard are finalized.
It’s already difficult for a student to accuse a faculty member due to the fear of a potential impact on an individual’s academic future. The fact that the interim policy was passed but didn’t recognize this shortcoming – and exacerbates an existing problem – is distressing.
Anonymity will have repercussions when it comes to disciplinary proceedings. To progress to a formal hearing process, whether against a student or faculty member, students will need to disclose their identities to ensure a proper investigation.
As a result, the disciplinary process should protect both parties’ rights. Students should have the right to remain anonymous throughout the course of a sexual harassment investigation and hearing, but they must know that if they choose to do so, it will make the process less effective.
Deputy Title IX Coordinator Tara Pereira explained to me that it would be impossible to issue a no-contact order, a rule restricting one person from interacting with another, without informing the person of who they are prohibited from contacting. And she’s right: At a certain point, disclosing an identity is necessary to move forward with a case.
But still, the decision to remain anonymous should initially be afforded to all students.
Alleged victims of sexual assault should be allowed to protect their identities – no matter who is sitting across the table.

The GW Law School is at a crossroads.
This fall, the school will search for new leadership after dropping Dean Paul Schiff Berman after only 18 months. The search coincides with a changing legal market and increased scrutiny of what is traditionally required of a legal education.
The law school can innovate to adapt to a new legal job market. Or, it can adhere to a more traditional approach that has served the school well – and placed it at the coveted No. 20 rank.
But to remain competitive, the new dean of the law school will have to adopt both approaches.
There was the approach of Berman – an outsider and proponent of challenging traditional notions of legal education. And then there’s Gregory Maggs, the re-appointed interim dean and a senior member of the school’s faculty approach, who calls for careful review of new initiatives and collective decision making.
Four months ago, Berman was still talking about his new initiatives for the law school, and chief among them was tailoring legal education.
“What I was interested in was, how can we take each individual student’s set of interests and tailor a set of experiences that respond to those interests,” Berman told me.
In an increasingly competitive legal job market, Berman wanted to use GW’s vast resources and reach to help students design a set of experiences that would help make them competitive. He also expanded a program that allocates stipends to struggling graduates for internships until they find jobs.
And last summer, Berman’s unconventional thinking won him the National Law Journal’s award as one of 20 “Champion and Visionaries” of the law in the District.
But the dean moved to the provost’s office as the new vice provost for online education and academic innovation at the end of last semester. It seems like Berman’s “academic innovation” was out of place in GW’s flagship law school.
Maggs, who was also interim dean before Berman was hired, replaced him. His return avoided giving the school a fourth dean in four years.
Maggs’ approach is quite different from Berman’s. In an interview, I asked Maggs about his top priorities as dean. He responded by highlighting the importance of collective decision making and sending major decisions at all levels through the committee.
I pressed Maggs to explain his reasoning.
“It’s a priority because I don’t have all the answers,” he said. “I think we work best when we make collective decisions.”
Maggs is the law school’s answer to Berman’s 18 months of new initiatives. Unlike Berman, who tried to make an immediate impact on the law school, Maggs is more careful and cautious.
Where Berman emphasized to me his initiatives to change the face of the law school, Maggs emphasized that for him, relying on other leaders there for support and guidance is a priority.
At this time of uncertainty in legal education, Berman’s departure was a poor decision for the law school. He was trying to be proactive and find new ways to provide students a quality legal education.
Going forward, the law school needs a leader who recognizes that innovation is necessary if the school is going to stay ahead. But it also needs someone who is pragmatic and who would look to the faculty for guidance and support. The new dean will have to balance these two perspectives. He or she must be someone who can push the boundaries of a legal education while also maintaining the trust and high opinion of his or her colleagues.
The new dean will have to find a way to strike a balance or else he or she will be out too.

I am writing in response to the article “The hidden costs of campus dining” (Feb. 4, p. 1), in which The Hatchet reported that J Street is unlikely to turn a profit.
The University has, over time, developed what we believe to be the most flexible university dining program in the country. The program offers both campus dining dollars and Colonial Cash, providing students with access to a variety of campus dining venues such as J Street, Pelham Commons, ZeBi and G-Dub Java and also the option to patronize eateries throughout Foggy Bottom and the District.  The University constantly evaluates the balance of flexibility in the dining program with the goal of providing variety and quality on-campus offerings.
With regard to the concept of “hidden costs,” all business owners must take into account operating costs – such as rent, staffing and cost of goods and sales – when establishing prices. It is important to note that vendors are not permitted to charge a “tariff” for using the GWorld card. In addition, there is no direct correlation between locations that accept GWorld and those that charge higher prices.
For example, at Whole Foods Foggy Bottom – which accepts GWorld – the cost per pound for the hot food and salad bar at is the same as the Arlington, Va., location and even less than the P Street location. Neither of those locations accept GWorld.  Similarly, the cost of a pita sandwich at Perfect Pita in The Shops at 2000 Penn is the same as other D.C. locations that do not partner with GWorld. This is also true for offerings at Sweetgreen and CVS.
There are many opinions about what constitutes the best dining plan. We consistently take into account these viewpoints as we continually review our plan. We will continue to work to create the best plan possible for our students while taking into account the desires for both flexibility and quality.
I encourage students to share comments and ideas on how to improve the dining program through engagement with the Student Dining Board or by completing a comment card, available at campus dining venues.
