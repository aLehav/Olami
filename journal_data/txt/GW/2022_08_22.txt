SA Senators said they plan to encourage people from marginalized groups to run and to get a broader spectrum of student viewpoints on University operations. 
Updated: Aug. 22, 2022 at 12:54 p.m.
The Student Association’s leadership has become more diverse during the past decade, but the SA Senate remains a predominately male body that some senators say fails to accurately represent the student population.
People of color have increasingly occupied the SA’s top leadership positions, where women have also maintained a consistent presence in the last 10 years. But gender diversity has lagged behind in the senate, where nine of this year’s 37 senators identify as female – a 24 percent composition compared to the entire University population that is 63 percent female, according to University enrollment data.
SA senators said they plan to reach out to student organizations to encourage people from marginalized groups, including women and racial minorities, to run and recruit a broader spectrum of student viewpoints.
Women in the SA
Within the last decade, 10 of the last 20 SA presidents and executive vice presidents have identified as female. But in the senate, only two of the six committee chairs identify as female. The senate plans to hold re-elections for chairs to give the 12 senators who filled vacancies this summer – among them, female students, students of color and nontraditional students like part-time students – a chance to run.
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
SA Sen. Linsi Goodin, CCAS-G and the only female member of the SA’s governance and nominations committee, said the committee prioritizes merit, selecting the most qualified candidates instead of filling diversity quotas. She said the SA is predominantly male, but she thinks it “has not been an issue.”
“You can advertise, but you can’t exactly put an Instagram post, ‘We want you – women, international students specifically,’” she said. “We can talk about a diverse perspective as much as we want, but if people aren’t applying, then people just aren’t applying.”
Goodin said the governance and nominations committee was proud to nominate a female student of color for the full senate to consider, filling the GWSB-G seat earlier this month. She said the SA should continue to improve its communications to advertise its positions.
Goodin said an executive secretary for diversity, equity and inclusion could help bolster resources for promoting diversity within the executive administration.
“I think a lot of the controversy with the SA has overshadowed whatever good work we might have done or could do,” she said.
When the senate initially confirmed this year’s committee chairs on May 2, graduating senator Chris Pino, CCAS-U, said this year’s senate has the lowest percentage of female chairs in the last decade, “if not longer or forever.”
Racial diversity in SA leadership
Ashley Le, the first Asian woman to be SA president and an adjunct professor of media and public affairs, said her election showed that students were open and willing to electing a female president of color. Both she and her opponent Imani Ross were set to become the first female president of color, if elected during the 2018-19 SA election.
“Women are not always elevated into positions of leadership,” she said. “And I think that if we have the choice to do that, we should be able to do it.”
Le said the 2017-18 candidate pool provided representation for Black and Asian student communities, a significant achievement even if GW was, and is, predominantly white. The past three SA presidents have been Black men, dating back to Howie Brookins who was elected for the 2020-21 academic year. Before Brookins’ presidency, students had not elected a Black student as SA president in a decade.
She said her cabinet reached out to individual members of the Multicultural Student Services Center and student organizations, like the Interfaith Council, to encourage them to apply for the SA as part of recruitment efforts.
Le’s cabinet created positions for a director of international students and a director of interfaith engagement during her term. Last year’s director of interfaith engagement, Julia Kerrigan, hosted an interfaith week and coordinated off-campus transportation to worship sites while holding the position.
Le said eight of her nine cabinet members were female. She said she selected cabinet members based on merit and did not try to balance the cabinet’s gender ratio.
“People will say that, ‘OK, we have too many women, we have to balance it with men,’” she said. “We decided not to have that mentality.”
SA President Christian Zidouemba has yet to replace and confirm the at least seven cabinet members who resigned in early July. His current cabinet of four confirmed seats contains two female members.
Prior to her resignation this summer, former Chief of Staff Cordelia Scales said she planned to create a task force to work to prevent sexual assault on campus and advocate for victims. Keanu Rowe, the current chief of staff, did not respond to a request for comment on whether he was still creating the task force.
Looking forward
In 2018, the SA formed its diversity and inclusion assembly, a group of multicultural student leaders and SA Senators to share and respond to concerns on campus. The assembly has hosted town hall meetings in the wake of antisemitic and racist incidents on campus.
SA Sen. Henry Deng, CCAS-U and the chair of the SA’s diversity and inclusion assembly, said the DIA should continue working to solve campus-wide issues, following the lead of the executive cabinet’s initiative last year to put menstrual products in University bathrooms.
“I hope we can use the platform of DIA to connect students with different backgrounds together,” he said. “That includes working to do more events and improving our social media platform.”
The DIA hosted listening sessions throughout the 2019-20 school year, but its activity dropped off since then until this past spring.
After the senate elected Deng as the diversity and inclusion assembly chair in May, he remained the sole member of the body until mid-July, when he sponsored the DIA Reform Act to loosen the requirements to join the assembly. The DIA now has 10 members – five senators and five student leaders from organizations, like the International Students Association and the Pakistani Student Association.
Deng said the SA sometimes fails to engage with students due to confusion on how to communicate, so students may feel that their perspectives are being overlooked.
“I feel like we should have done much more in the previous years,” he said.
SA Sen. Lydia Miller, ESIA-U and the chair of the undergraduate student life committee, said her background as an international and female student pushed her to diversify the SA. She said she talked to female friends, many of them Eastern European students, who felt their voices lacked power on campus, especially compared to their male counterparts.
“They don’t think that their perspective is going to be taken as seriously, especially because they are girls,” she said.
Miller said the SA administration is improving upon its diversity in its new administration, which features international students and students of color, but the SA is not yet completely representative of the student body. She said connecting with the student population through outreach to student organizations will improve the SA’s relationship with diversity and inclusion and give the SA multiple perspectives on the issues students face.
“By going out to the student body rather than waiting for them to come to us to tell us their issues or their ideas, I kind of want to change the pace of that,” she said.

“We were best friends,” Shawn O’Donnell's mom said. “And now my best friend’s gone.” 
Updated: Aug. 23, 2022 at 12:43 p.m.
Marble busts and tall statues have decorated Foggy Bottom for years, but the neighborhood’s newest memorial sticks out among the rest to honor a loss of life that devastated the local community this summer.
A white bicycle adorned wheel-to-wheel with flowers and pictures sits at the corner of 21st and I streets in memory of Shawn O’Donnell, who died last month after a construction truck driver fatally struck her while she cycled to work. The intersection has been the site of calls for physical repairs dating back to 2018 during which students, activists, neighborhood officials and businesspeople have said the crossing was dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists alike.
The installation of a new traffic signal – a light that locals said would have likely prevented the crash – was completed on July 29, nine days after the truck driver killed O’Donnell. Despite more than four years of concerns from local leaders, the intersection remained largely unchanged on the morning of O’Donnell’s death.
As friends and family mourn the death of O’Donnell, locals are demanding to know why the intersection remained untouched – an alleged inaction from D.C. officials that allowed the tragedy that too many saw coming – despite widespread calls for change.

A lost daughter
On the night of July 19, Mary O’Donnell – a former rear admiral in the U.S. Coast Guard who currently lives in California – called her daughter Shawn on FaceTime, when the pair spoke about the farmers’ market and ways to keep strawberries fresh before saying goodnight. The next morning, O’Donnell opened her door to a police officer who told her that Shawn had been killed after the driver of a construction truck turned into her while she rode her bicycle alongside to her job at the State Department.
O’Donnell said her daughter was a generous, one-of-a-kind person who traveled the world in an effort to make it a better place, like teaching English in Egypt and serving as a refugee officer in Thailand. O’Donnell said Shawn, a State Department official, was preparing to leave for Amsterdam, where her next assignment would be, when the driver struck and killed her.
“We were best friends,” O’Donnell said. “And now my best friend’s gone.”
In 2018, nearly four years before the truck driver struck and killed O’Donnell, two local leaders and a building developer said the District Department of Transportation should add safety infrastructure to the intersection of 21st and I streets to protect pedestrians and cyclists. When O’Donnell was killed, DDOT was in the process of installing a new traffic signal at that intersection, but locals said the changes didn’t come soon enough.
A DDOT spokesperson said in an email that full operation of the light didn’t start until July 29 – nine days after the July 20 death of Shawn O’Donnell.
Marina Streznewski, the then-president of the Foggy Bottom Association, told The Hatchet in 2018 that the intersection needed a traffic signal “a long time ago.”
“It was the same thing for years and years and years,” Streznewski said in an interview last week. “You just had to be really careful crossing that street.”
Streznewski, who said she thinks the new traffic signal would have prevented the collision, said crossing 21st Street has been difficult since her time as a GW student in the 1970s because drivers would need to use their own judgement to stop for pedestrians given the lack of a traffic signal or stop sign.
The pair of intersections of 21st Street with Pennsylvania Avenue and I Street were ranked by Greater Greater Washington in the top 10 most dangerous intersections in the District, based on DDOT and Metropolitan Police Department data. A total of 35 crashes took place at those intersections between 2015 and 2020 while locals made 13 safety requests to DDOT, according to GGWash.
“I was very sad,” Streznewski said about learning of the death of O’Donnell. “But I was not the least bit surprised.”
Too little, too late
A DDOT spokesperson said the traffic light’s installation was completed on July 19, the day before the fatal collision, but the signal entered an at least weeklong “flashing operation” – as required by DDOT – in which the lights blinked but were not fully operational. The lights were blinking but not operational when the driver of the truck struck and killed O’Donnell on the morning of July 20.
The spokesperson said construction on the traffic signal’s physical infrastructure began in the fall of 2021 and was completed this January, but the signal still required electrification from PEPCO. DDOT initially sent PEPCO an electrification request to turn on the power for the signal in August of 2021, but PEPCO did not complete the request until late this June, the spokesperson said.
They said the timeline for the design and construction of this signal was “typical” for “projects of this type.” The spokesperson said DDOT closed at least three requests for traffic safety investigations into the intersection since 2019 because of a previous rule requiring people requesting investigations to fill a separate form called traffic calming applications.
Boston Properties, the real estate firm that built the new 2100 Penn building, planned to pay for the new light in a deal with the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission to address the safety concerns following years of close calls at the intersection.
In 2018, Jake Stroman – the executive vice president of Boston Properties – said he expected construction on the traffic light to begin in 2019 and finish in 2021 due to multiple phases of approval for the project.
Calls for safety improvements continue
Shawn O’Donnell was one of three cyclists to die on the streets of D.C. in July, sparking calls to the D.C. Council to implement reforms that could protect cyclists, like banning right turns on red lights. The Council plans to vote in September on a bill – the Safer Streets Amendment Act of 2022 – that would prohibit vehicles from making right turns on red lights and allow bikers to treat stop signs as yield signs.
Yannik Omictin, an alumnus and commissioner on the Foggy Bottom and West End ANC, said he was shocked when he learned O’Donnell had died at that intersection, but not surprised. Omictin said the intersection of 21st and I streets had the “bare minimum” in terms of protections for pedestrians and cyclists.
“We knew this was going to happen at this intersection,” Omictin said. “I think every unprotected intersection in D.C. is a place where someone can die.”
In an ANC meeting February, Omictin identified about 50 intersections in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood eligible for improved infrastructure, including the corner of 21st and I streets. Omictin introduced a map of the intersections in the meeting and marked that intersection as one that needs a raised crosswalk, which increase visibility and slow vehicles down.
Omictin said in an interview that DDOT has failed to be proactive for years in constructing protective infrastructure, like traffic signals and stop signs because of insufficient staffing and poor management.
“DDOT can blame supply chain issues, they can blame PEPCO not being responsive to their requests to connect the power,” Omictin said. “But there are some places in D.C. that have waited years – there’s one place in Petworth that waited seven years for a four-way stop sign and some additional safety measures.”
Omictin said it shouldn’t have taken nearly five years to install a traffic signal at the intersection, and management at DDOT, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, should implement a plan to make the department’s processes more efficient.
“It is simply a failure of leadership at the highest level that we see projects that should happen in days, happen in years,” he said.
Looking forward, Omictin said community members and city officials should do everything in their power to advance the installation of bike lanes and other protective infrastructure to save lives in D.C. He said pedestrian and cyclist safety will make the streets more habitable to non-car transportation, modes that are more accessible for many residents that shouldn’t be dangerous.
“I’m sure that folks who work for DDOT and who have to interface with the community every day are sick and tired of hearing the community’s complaints and attending memorials for people who died because DDOT didn’t act fast enough,” he said.

Thurston, which previously housed about 1,100 students, making it the largest residence hall on campus, became a target of criticism in recent years due to outdated facilities, mold and frequent leaks.
After more than five decades as GW’s black mold hub and two years as a construction project, Thurston Hall is entering its new era as one of the most state-of-the-art residence halls on campus, welcoming students for the first time since 2019.
A green courtyard area that sits directly behind the first-floor lobby greets students in a display of newly designed architecture, one of many renovations which also include additional study spaces, wider elevators and a dining hall set to be completed in September. Upgrades for Thurston had been discussed for decades after the building had become notorious for its disrepair, with upgrades announced in 2018 and formally beginning in May 2020.
“Thurston Hall will continue to provide a space for students to thrive, build lifelong connections and have a sense of belonging,” Associate Vice President for Business Services Seth Weinshel said in an email. “The new usable courtyard, multiple outdoor spaces and dozens of community spaces will allow students to connect with each other and build community.”
Thurston – which previously housed about 1,100 students as the largest residence hall on campus – became a target of criticism from both students and administrators in recent years due to outdated facilities, mold and frequent leaks. In November 2019, a small fire and subsequent sprinkler damage displaced some students from the building.
The renovated residence hall will hold 16 study lounges, 820 beds and the one to-be-completed dining hall.
When the renovations were announced in 2018, then-University President Thomas LeBlanc emphasized improving students’ living spaces as a reason for the upgrades. Officials have cited a desire to increase community as the impetus for several recent changes to student life in Foggy Bottom, including Thurston’s renovations and the construction of dining halls.
“Thurston should be reflective of a preeminent institution, and we have a vision for a dynamic, inclusive community that helps students feel at home at GW,” LeBlanc said about the renovations in 2019.
Officials are offering naming opportunities to donors for study rooms, residential rooms, lounges, community spaces and more for prices between tens of thousands of dollars for a residential room to a million dollars for the dining hall, according to the University’s website.
Student Association President Christian Zidouemba said Thurston’s new look was “marvelous” when he first toured the residence hall earlier this month, and freshmen should be “excited” to move in. He said additions like larger elevators and more communal spaces make the building more accommodating than it had been prior to the renovations.
“The way it’s been created is to give a sense of community, a sense of belonging to Thurston,” Zidouemba said.
Zidouemba said amenities like study spaces, which are available for students on each floor, give students the option of studying in a building closer than Gelman Library, which has a limited number of reserved study rooms. Zidouemba also said Thurston’s dining hall, which is set to be completed in September, will feature an automated system that enables facial recognition as an optional payment method.
More than a dozen freshmen living in Thurston said they were impressed with Thurston’s new look and excited about the building’s organization with plenty of communal space to meet new people.
Mallory Viotto, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said she appreciated how modern and clean the residence hall felt and how she was welcomed into the building. She said the green space on the first floor will help her connect with her friends and other freshmen.
“You can really connect with your peers and I know a lot of the freshmen are going to be living here,” Viotto said. “It’s a really great way to bond with the freshman class.”
Viotto said the abundance of study spaces will allow her and her roommates to spend time in the building outside of their room. She said the variety of study areas offer plenty of options for other floors or rooms with more space or better views.
“We were even talking about this, how much are we really going to be at our desks when we have all these amazing study rooms and everything?” Viotto said.
Elyse Arragon, a freshman majoring in international affairs, said she most-anticipated the communal kitchens and study spaces because of how they could foster community. She said the central courtyard could act as an exclusive meeting spot for students in the middle of D.C.
“The central courtyard unites all of the floors together,” Arragon said. “It acts like a green space for students in the middle of the city.”
Stella Weiss, a freshman majoring in international business, said she appreciated the accessibility Thurston provides with amenities like trash chutes and laundry. She said she also enjoyed how modern and clean her room was.
“It’s really nice to have an updated dorm,” Weiss said. “I know that’s not common for freshmen.”
Michelle Seaver, a freshman majoring in international affairs said because she lives in a one-person unit without a roommate, she will be able to meet others more easily in the common spaces. She said the warm greeting from the move-in team stood out to her when they helped her move in.
“I have a single dorm,” Seaver said. “So that was especially important for me to go and meet with people because you know, I don’t have someone to rely on.”
Olivia Earley, a freshman majoring in political science and dance, said the dining hall adds to the convenience of Thurston’s location. She said many common areas will make meeting new people easier for her.
“The common space is really nice, getting to come together with all my fellow classmates in person and just get to know people,” Earley said.

The week kicks off Monday morning with a welcome breakfast with GW Hillel, followed by “Building Welcome Programs,” which will introduce freshmen to their residence hall and living community. 
It’s about that time again, when thousands of freshmen full of luggage stockpiled in blue carts will make their way to campus for a week full of orientation events.
This year’s Orientation Week spans from this past Saturday, Aug. 20 through next Sunday, Aug. 28 and is full of academic information sessions and other educational resources alongside recreational activities, like cookouts at the Mount Vernon Campus quad and monument walks, to introduce freshmen to campus life. New Student Orientation occurs annually right before classes start as a way for freshmen to feel more confident as they enter a new chapter of their academic and social lives – this year’s theme is presented as Empowering Community: Reflection & Resilience.
Izzy Banks, a student coordinator who helped plan New Student Orientation programming and train orientation leaders, said the week of events is vital for freshmen to establish their own community on campus.
“I believe that one of the most exciting parts about matriculating into college is meeting new people and learning about the University,” she said in an email. “Orientation is the perfect opportunity to do this and facilitates such activities.”
Banks said the team of orientation leaders planned Orientation Week events based on six principles – preparing students for GW and D.C., developing a culture of compassion, maintaining participation, encouraging shared pride in GW, building community connections, promoting open discussion and destigmatizing health-related resources. She said the principles are meant to create an orientation structure that can connect students to academic departments and student organizations through GW’s resources and events, like Org Fair Fridays.
“Incoming students are not in this alone,” Banks said. “Not only are they part of an amazing incoming class, but they are now members of the GW community, and they have the support of their fellow community members throughout the week and throughout their time at GW.”
The week of orientation events kicks off Monday morning with a welcome breakfast with GW Hillel, followed by “Building Welcome Programs,” which will introduce freshmen to their residence hall and living community. Tuesday is chock-full of events, including an optional campus tour with admissions guides and a movie night on the Mount Vernon Campus quad.
Daniel Pink, the author of five New York Times bestsellers, will deliver a keynote speech Wednesday morning to discuss his book “The Power of Regret,” which GW distribute to the freshman class for encouraged summer reading in June. Transfer students can also join a meet-and-greet later from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m.
Wednesday night, the entire Class of 2026 will file into the Smith Center, where interim University President Mark Wrighton among other faculty and staff will address students at the spirit-filled Buff and Blue Kickoff. Banks said students will learn GW’s fight song at the assembly before the night turns into live music at the annual House Party, where students can dance with friends, play games and take a stab at winning more prizes.
Thursday morning will start with orientation events hosted by each undergraduate academic school. Later that night, kick back to the early 2000s with GW Late Night Committee’s first-ever ​​​​​​​​​​​​Throwback Thursday Takeover at 9 p.m. in the University Student Center. Students will be able to partake in trivia with a team of friends, watch a 2000s film, play video games and make crafts.
Friday ushers in some of the largest recreational events of the week that freshmen can’t miss. Soak up the final week of summer at the Mount Vernon Pool Party or embrace the District’s landmarks at the National Mall Kickback with lawn games and food before a late-night monument walk.
On Saturday, the Welcome Day of Service – hosted by the Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service – will introduce freshmen to community service opportunities within the D.C. region spanning across D.C. and parts of Maryland from 12:30 to 5 p.m.
Orientation Week will cap off Saturday evening with the University’s biggest event of the year – First Night. This spirited whirlwind of a celebration features carnival games, inflatables, free food from vendors like Dominos and Insomnia Cookies and a chance to win prizes.
On Sunday, new students will attend a training session with the Title IX Office, which will teach how to “prevent sexual harassment through the use of active bystander skills” and provide a general overview of students’ rights, responsibilities and campus resources under Title IX.
Feel overwhelmed by the week’s packed schedule? Banks recommends students to reach out to members of the orientation leadership team, who give out their information to their assigned small group of about 25 freshmen.
“The orientation leader that students were assigned over the summer are still available to them as resources and can provide a lot of reassurance about the schedule,” she said.
Banks said she hopes freshmen walk away from orientation with a sense of belonging within the GW community. She said the orientation team aims to ensure they experience and form new relationships that will help them solidify this connection.
“Whether this be an organization at the org fair, a department at GW or a student who they got the opportunity to meet, we want to introduce students to everything that GW has,” Banks said. “And we hope that they come away with a vision of what their life at GW will look like.”

Officials said the Student Health Center's Medical Services team has partnered with the D.C. Department of Health to diagnose and treat the “handful” of cases within the GW community over the summer. 
The Student Health Center is treating patients for monkeypox on campus and educating GW community members about the spread of the disease after officials identified a “handful” of cases within the community.
Rebekka Christie, the medical director of the Student Health Center, said the SHC, formerly the Colonial Health Center, is assessing and quickly diagnosing suspected positive cases through a partnership with the D.C. Department of Health to shore up treatment and awareness of the disease in the local area. She said officials are aiming to educate students through presentations about monkeypox and other communicable diseases in an effort to prevent outbreaks on campus, but Christie declined to release the number of cases within the GW community.
Christie said the SHC’s medical services team has partnered with the health department to diagnose and treat the “handful” of cases within the GW community over the summer. Christie said each community member who contracted monkeypox recovered from the disease. 
Officials reported GW’s first case of monkeypox within the GW community in late June.
Christie said the SHC plans to assess presumptive cases through telehealth appointments before bringing patients in for an in-person clinical evaluation.
“It is important to understand that monkeypox is an infection that every member of the GW community should be aware of because everyone is at risk for infection if exposed, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity,” Christie said in an email.
Christie said the SHC refers patients with a high risk of exposure to the D.C. Department of Health for a vaccination and will provide access to the drug tecovirimat, whose brand name is Tpoxx, for monkeypox treatment to students with severe symptoms.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Federal Drug Administration last week authorized the Jynneos vaccine to be administered intradermally – a process of injecting the vaccine into the skin instead of the layer of fat underneath the skin – which increases the number of doses in each vial by five times.
Monkeypox is spread through direct and indirect contact with skin lesions or through respiratory droplets, most commonly through sexual interactions. Symptoms like fever or chills, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, rash and skin lesions can occur five to 21 days after exposure.
Christie said the SHC and the Capital Peers Sexual Health Task Force – a group of peer health educators that produce education and health promotion to the GW student body – will hold presentations and outreach programs about health and wellness in residence halls to raise awareness of monkeypox and other contagious diseases. She said the medical services team has educated staff about the virus throughout the summer to help them better understand “communicable diseases.”
She said officials from GW and other universities in the area – including Georgetown, American, Howard, Catholic, George Mason universities and the University of Maryland – receive updates on monkeypox, its health impacts in the city and the status of protocols from D.C. government representatives. Christie said the meetings are bi-monthly and hosted by the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, a group of local higher education institutions.
Christie said the SHC is not accepting walk-in visitors and recommends students to call the clinic if they are experiencing symptoms or have been exposed to the virus in an effort to mitigate transmission.
Officials earlier this month released their first public health update on monkeypox, saying the spread of the virus in the GW community remains “very low.”
There are more than 14,000 confirmed cases nationwide since the first case was documented in May, as of Aug. 18.
The White House declared monkeypox a public health emergency and announced new initiatives to increase access to care and resources in early August, a week after the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern late last month.
D.C. Health offers monkeypox vaccines to adult residents, employees, college students and patients in D.C. who’ve had multiple sexual partners in the last two weeks, sex workers and staff at establishments where sexual activity occurs.
D.C. Health reported 350 positive cases and vaccinated more than 16,000 individuals for monkeypox in the District as of Aug. 16. D.C. Health runs walkup vaccine clinics in Ward 2, 4 and 8 on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Georgetown and American universities have both identified presumptive cases of monkeypox and have provided information to their respective communities to reduce the transmission of the virus over the summer.
Experts in infectious disease and epidemiology said universities should expect monkeypox cases to rise and make students and faculty aware of the risk the virus poses through accurate information and education about symptoms and treatments associated with monkeypox.
Amesh Adolja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health and an infectious disease physician, said monkeypox won’t be as “impactful” on college campuses as COVID-19, but colleges should be prepared to log cases and limit spread. He said most people who contract the virus don’t typically need supportive care, but some patients do respond to treatment from the antiviral drug Tpoxx.
“The key is just making sure that these [treatments] are available to people and that people are aware of the risk and that universities take proactive steps in the event that they do have a case or exposure on their campus,” Adolja said.
Adolja said the virus is quickly spreading among men who have sex with men, and people must ensure that individuals in that group are aware of the high transmission rates.
“There’s a tendency to look at every infectious disease emergency through the lens of COVID-19,” Adolja said. “They are not going to be like COVID-19, and monkeypox is a disease that’s been known to science since the 1950s for which we have a vaccine antiviral in testing.”
Andrew Brouwer, an assistant research scientist in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said college campuses have the potential to be “transmission hotspots” because young adults typically have a higher number of sexual partners and most transmission of the virus has occurred because of sexual interactions in the current outbreak. He said there is a potential for spread through close proximity in residence halls, sports and parties because the virus can also spread through non-sexual skin-to-skin contact, surfaces and linens.
“Just because those routes of transmission are possible, does not mean that they are likely,” Brouwer said in an email. “We need to watch for changing guidance as the outbreak continues.”
Brouwer said the University of Michigan has not reported any monkeypox cases, but the university is prepared to treat and test possible cases and vaccinate priority groups. He said the best way to stop transmission is to interrupt transmission chains and practice safe sex.
Brouwer said arguments about classifying monkeypox as a sexually transmitted infection are not “productive” even though the majority of transmission has occurred through sexual interactions and awareness about an individual’s current risk of contracting the virus is crucial in understanding monkeypox.
“It is important to have compassion for people that are infected,” Brouwer said. “It is often stigmatizing to have a disease (we saw a lot of shaming in the COVID-19 pandemic) and that is especially true for a disease that can be transmitted through sexual contact.”

Former University President Thomas LeBlanc’s pay fell from more than $1.36 million to about $1.25 million, or a cut of more than $115,000. 
Most senior administrators saw their overall compensation fall during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, according to public disclosure documents released by GW in June.
The drop during the fiscal year 2021 – which starts in July of 2020 and ends in June of 2021 – came on the backdrop of a voluntary pay reduction of about five percent or more that several top leaders took in April 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data about officials’ compensation come from GW’s annual Form 990, which the Internal Revenue Service requires all tax-exempt organizations to make public, and shows that most top officials’ total compensation fell between four to 10 percent between the two fiscal years.
University spokesperson Josh Grossman declined to comment on whether senior administrators’ salaries would increase or decrease during fiscal year 2022. He said the Board of Trustees’ Executive Committee decides whether to change compensation for senior officials.
“In making its assessments, the committee obtains compensation information prepared by an independent compensation consulting firm that includes market data from comparable universities for comparable positions,” he said.
Grossman said “many factors” contribute to GW employees’ compensation in a given year.
“GW is a world-class university and employer of choice, and we are fortunate to attract highly qualified and talented members of staff, faculty and administrative and academic leadership,” he said in an email.
A series of top administrators have left GW over the last few years, many of whom saw their pay fall during fiscal year 2021, including former University President Thomas LeBlanc and former Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz. Interim University President Mark Wrighton brought on four new administrators, including a new CFO and human resource officer, in July, but the University is still searching for a string of permanent top officials like a chief technology officer.

While several top officials saw their pay drop, some administrators got salary bumps.
Former Chief Information Officer Loretta Early was one of the only officials to see her compensation rise from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 with her total compensation being around $575,000 during the 2020-21 academic year, more than a $200,000 boost, even though she left the University in September 2020 – just months after the fiscal year began.
Vice President for Health Affairs and Dean of the School of Medicine and Public Health Jeffrey Akman also saw his pay rise by more than a third, to more than $1.3 million, making him the highest-paid official listed in the disclosure documents.
Grossman declined to comment on why Early and Akman’s total compensation rose.
LeBlanc’s pay fell between the end of fiscal year 2020 in June 2020 to the end of fiscal year 2021 in June 2021 from more than $1.36 million to about $1.25 million, a cut of more than $115,000. LeBlanc officially departed the University in December 2021 after announcing his retirement in June 2021.
At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, LeBlanc said he would take a roughly 20 percent pay cut, but his base salary actually fell by less than 14 percent, while his total compensation — which includes bonuses and other benefits — fell by about 8 percent, according to the disclosure.
“Many others at GW have been diligently preparing for what is to come and to help our University weather what will be more difficulties ahead, including with our finances,” LeBlanc said in an April 2020 release. “In many ways, our path forward, and that of every other University, is uncharted.”
LeBlanc was the 40th highest-paid private university president in 2019 – before he took his pay cut in 2020 – according to a data report published by the Chronicle of Higher Education last week.
Wrighton was the seventh highest-paid private university president, collecting more than $2.8 million in total compensation from his position as chancellor of Washington University, St. Louis in 2019, according to the report. Wrighton also had the highest base salary of private university presidents, according to the data.
LeBlanc was also paid more than six of the presidents of GW’s 12 peer schools, according to the report.
Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Mark Diaz took a similar pay reduction of more than $90,000 during the 2020-21 academic year, which totaled almost 10 percent of his pay.
The most recent public disclosure document is also the first year former Provost Brian Blake received a full-year salary, which totaled almost $750,000. Blake had received about $180,000 the previous year, but he had only been in the role for about seven months when the public disclosure was written.
Former University President Steven Knapp – who has received income from the University since he departed GW in 2017 – also saw his total pay fall from more than $460,000 to about $175,000, a more than 60 percent drop.
Grossman declined to comment on why Knapp’s pay dropped significantly more than other officials.

It’s no secret that GW students are inseparable from politics to the point that it feels like republicans and democrats are only united by their curriculum. In Foggy Bottom and across the country, political polarization has split us into spiteful groups with little interest in our peers’ ideas. Instead of getting to know our enemies, we’ve resorted to stereotypes and assumptions meant to blunt challenges to our opinions. But even the most partisan students can start rebuilding a foundation for compromise and coexistence.
We don’t actually know who or what we’re disagreeing with, but we’re dead set on our own beliefs. Respondents in a 2015 poll of democrats, republicans and independents said they believed that 38 percent of republicans make more than $250,000 and that nearly a third of democrats were part of the LGBTQ+ community. The correct numbers for each statistic are two and six percent, respectively. You can’t argue with a made-up opponent. We’re totally ignorant about the people with whom we claim to disagree.
Across the country and on campus, we tend to view the opposing group more like an enemy than an alternative because of that ignorance. A majority of democrats and republicans view members of the opposing party as a serious threat, and members of both parties have increasingly perceived one another as “immoral” since 2016. Seventy-seven percent of Americans called the country “more divided than before the outbreak” of COVID-19, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study. And half of Americans at least somewhat agree that a civil war will happen “in the next few years,” according to a separate study by the University of California-Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program this summer.
So what is the source of all this ignorance? Political identity has taken on a life of its own as our personal identities and political preferences increasingly overlap. GW students – and Americans more broadly – have shifted into distinct groups based largely on political issues. Whether they self-identify as democrats, independents, socialists, republicans or something else entirely, students can’t change how political parties operate. But we can and should tweak our approach to politics – we must acknowledge the merits of an argument beyond our opinion of its arguer.
Instead of letting politics subsume our identity, we should explain what we believe and why we believe it based on our own experiences. There are a plethora of positions to take on issues like abortion, immigration and climate change, and listening to others – even those with whom you disagree – can shift your own positions. A well-intentioned argument and a willingness to listen could make the difference between conservatives joining the global calls for environmental protection or liberals supporting stricter border control measures.
We don’t have to consume all the same news sources or follow the same Twitter accounts, but we need to occupy a shared political reality – we need to know what other people think, especially those with whom we disagree. While it’s commendable to stay true to your principles on any front, remember that you’re probably just as certain in your beliefs as your opponent. Instead of trying to change someone’s mind or disprove them in a viral moment, think of your argument as an addition to their understanding of politics. When you make an impression on their political conscience, they’ll be forced to consider your contentions every time they argue their own.
Besides peer-to-peer conversations, student organizations can encourage students to share their perspectives before we take shelter in our ideological bunkers. If you’re already involved in politics on campus, it’s worth poking your head up and seeing what the other “side” is up to. Whether you represent a major party or a minor one, your student organization could invite guest speakers – those you agree with and those you don’t – to campus for the benefit of yourself and your peers.
GW also has its own chapter of Bridge USA, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating spaces for open discussions on politics across the ideological spectrum. Regular discussions on pressing political issues can help decrease polarization and lower the temperature of our rhetoric – when politics becomes less about blood sport and more about learning, everyone wins. At nearby George Mason University, Bridge USA’s events on topics like universal basic income and the effects of COVID-19 mandates on mental health have brought students together – we can do the same at GW.
Whether making groups in class, chatting in line at GW Deli or going out on the weekend, students on campus are eager to embrace their mutual diversity across the spectrum of beliefs and backgrounds. That shouldn’t stop when politics come into play. You don’t have to sacrifice your principles in pursuit of friendship, but we limit ourselves to only the most partisan perceptions of our peers when we fail to communicate our ideas with one another.
