Sophomore Bogdan Petvokic will lead a men's water polo team that has gone through an intense preseason. 
Bogdan Petvokic took home plenty of hardware during his freshman season.
The former Serbian Cadet National Team captain tallied an astonishing 96 steals last season, setting a new school record. He was named Rookie of the Year in the Collegiate Water Polo Association Southern Division, and nabbed an All-American honorable mention recognition.
Now, in his sophomore year, is preparing himself to lead by example as the Colonials step into the pool for their first games of the year this weekend at the Navy Open in Annapolis, Md.
“I have my role, it’s already shaped. I feel pretty good about it because now I have some position on the team where I can help out of the pool and in the pool as well,” Petvokic said.
First, the team will need to shake off a bit of last season’s ghosts.
Going into last season’s CWPA Championships, the Colonials found themselves facing it’s worst possible opponent: nationally ranked No.17 Bucknell.
Despite playing their best water polo of the year at those championships, the poor seeding that resulted from inconsistent regular season play led to the year’s unfortunate ending.
This year, Petvokic said the squad he said was bolstered before its first games this weekend by a solid preseason.
“It was probably one of the best preseasons that we’ve ever had. With all of the experience that we have on the team it was a pretty easy adjustment for the incoming freshmen – there’s no pressure on them – and the upper classmen did a good job of showing them the way to make it a pretty smooth preseason,” he said.
Petkovic and the 12 other returning letterwinners have already had a chance to get to know the teams four freshmen this preseason, with Petvokic describing the early training in one word: “Hard.”
“It was shorter than last year but at the same time it was twice as hard because it was shorter. Six hours a day in the pool, plus lifting, so it was hard but it’s already paying off,” he said.
Those long days in the pool included drills where players had to tread water while holding water cooler jugs above their heads. This hard work in preseason training is worth it, head Coach Scott Reed said, as the Colonials prepare themselves for competition in a very tough division.
“There are probably eight teams out there that can probably put together a great performance and win conference championships,” Reed said. “Every league game that we play is going to be extremely difficult.
Petvokic echoed his coach’s remarks, saying, that despite the CWPA Championships expanding the number of qualifying teams from eight to 12, it will be no easy task in the Southern Division.
“The division is pretty tough because it’s pretty even. You don’t have any games you can ease through, so every game counts,” he said. “That’s what it really comes down to, every game counts and every game you’re on the verge of winning or losing and that’s what really determines the champions.”
This season, the Colonials will count on their experience, with nine upperclassmen. They helped GW over the 300-goal mark for the second time in a row last season.
Last year;s potent offense is largely intact, with top scorers and seniors Daniel Tyner and Nate Little spurring on the offense.
Petvokic, along with senior Adam Streeter and sophomore Jonah Dowd, will anchor the defense that Reed said will need to stay consistent all season and all match long to improve on last year’s 12-16 record.
“This year, the goals are that we want to be very consistent about what we do during the regular season – no consecutive losses,” Reed said. “I think sometimes last year we kind of dwelled on those losses and that’s something we just want to keep moving forward from, instead of going backwards.”
The team did lose starting goalkeeper Cameron Illes. The job of filling his role will fall to sophomore Connor Dillon, with freshman Sander Profaci right on his heels for the starting position.

University police officers reported six students for alcohol possession at Fall Fest this year, a 60 percent decrease compared to GW’s annual spring show.
The half-dozen violations were reported in University Yard starting at about 4 p.m., much fewer than the dozen liquor law violations at last year’s Spring Fling starring Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. Officers logged a total of 13 liquor violations though across campus Saturday, however which is just shy of last spring’s 19 violations on the day of the concert.
Last year, UPD reported six students for disorderly conduct at the spring show, including a student who was arrested for assaulting two officers. This year, one student was reported but was not arrested.
UPD Chief Kevin Hay said the number of charges in April was unusual for University-held concerts, which was held on one of the first warm weekends. He said the popularity of Macklemore likely contributed to the uptick.
“When that entertainer’s name was first announced, I guess he had a No. 1 hit soon thereafter, so he really brought in a lot of energy that I don’t know was completely anticipated,” Hay said in an interview.
In the spring, officers started to deny students access to University Yard after the crowd grew too large around the stage. Hundreds had lined up as early as 2:30 p.m. to watch the show.
A smaller crowd came to see Timeflies and DJ Earworm on Saturday.
UPD determines security measures based on anticipated crowd size, the number of entrances and exits to the event and the type of entertainer: “Is it a gospel choir or is it something a little more fast?” Hay said.
Hay added that pregame parties can contribute to the number of liquor law violations, along with underage students using fake IDs to buy or drink alcohol.
“When we look at a lot of the worst incidents we had last year, you can trace them back to an evening that began with the use of a fake ID, where they drank to excess and then bad things happened downstream,” Hay said.
This post was updated Sept. 5 to reflect the following correction
Due to editing errors, The Hatchet incorrectly reported that five students had received liquor law violations last weekend instead of six. In addition, 19 total liquor law violations took place on campus last spring, not 16.

GW’s medical school, the most selective in the country, is taking steps to enroll more minority students this year, in part by giving less weight to applicants’ GPA and test scores.
The School of Medicine and Health Sciences already fields more applications from black and Latino students than nearly every school in the country, according to the most recent data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Still, minority students made up less than one-third of the school’s student body last year – a rate that newly hired head of diversity, Yolanda Haywood, said she hopes to change.
Haywood, the school’s first associate dean for diversity, inclusion and student affairs, was hired last month as the first to officially oversee the school’s efforts to increase diversity – a major goal of Dean Jeffrey Akman.
She said as the school tries to attract students from different backgrounds, administrators are not striving for a specific target. Among her responsibilities: recruiting students from underrepresented groups and expanding support programs to help during the daunting application process.
“There are no ‘quotas or numbers’ associated with this initiative. The whole point is to create a medical workforce that can address the needs of their patients – which is becoming increasingly more diverse,” Haywood, an alumna, said in an email.
Students who train in diverse environments are better prepared in their research and practices, according to a 2008 study by the University of California’s Higher Education Research Institute.
The move should also help shore up GW’s image for accreditors. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education has issued more sanctions in recent years, with some colleges failing to meet diversity standards in their student bodies and faculty.
GW’s medical school was put on probation from 2008 to 2010 because of inadequate administrative processes and curriculum.
Haywood added that GW students should prepare to treat patients in D.C., where African Americans make up nearly half the population.
“By virtue of D.C. having a multi-cultural population, it’s always been a priority that we maintain a diverse community,” she said.
About 14 percent of GW medical school students identified as black or Hispanic last year, according to the Office of Institutional Research and Planning. That’s about on par with the rate from 10 years ago.
Nearly one-fifth of GW’s medical students were Asian last year, which puts GW at No. 19 nationwide for the largest population of Asian students.
Haywood, who is also an associate professor of emergency medicine, said she’ll draw on her previous experience running a program that brought local minority and disadvantaged high school graduates to GW’s campus for a month-long summer program about jobs in the health field. The Howard University graduate previously served as the assistant dean for curricular and student affairs.
She will also help steer faculty searches to continue the school’s trend toward hiring more diverse staff members. The number of white faculty members has decreased since 2007.
At the University-level, Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Harris Reed has helped ensure that search committees are considering diverse candidates.
But increasing diversity among tenured and tenure-track faculty is a slow process, Reed said. While more minority students are earning doctoral degrees in their fields than ever before, many in that group are still years away from qualifying for tenured faculty positions.
Henry Sondheimer, who directs education projects at the Association of American Medical Colleges, has long pushed medical schools to embrace holistic review to increase schools’ diversity.
He said there’s little chance that choosing more diverse applicants will affect the quality of that class because “the applicant pool is so strong right now,” and the competition is growing more fierce each year.

Stephen Nelson swims to third place in the 500-yard freestyle in a meet against Georgetown last January. GW announced Sept. 3 that it will add diving to its list of varsity sports teams to help bolster the swimming program.
Athletic director Patrick Nero said Tuesday that the additions of men’s and women’s diving and track teams will give the Colonials a competitive edge.
The programs’ returns in 2014-15 support Patrick Nero’s two-year-old pledge to give every GW athletic program the chance to make a run in playoff competition. Without diving and track, the swimming and cross country teams, respectively, had slim chances to make it to postseason play, he said.
“What we’ve been doing is going through all of the teams and sitting down with the coaches and alumni, and saying, ‘What steps need to be taken to involve that particular team?” Nero said. “In the case of cross country and swimming, to allow that team to win an Atlantic 10 Championship.”
The additions represent a piece of the 2012 athletic strategic plan – now turning from plan to tangible change. That plan also called for a surge in fundraising – $1 million or more each year – and new facilities to attract higher-level recruits and coaches.
Nero said the department discussed bringing back the diving team, which was eliminated in 2009 to focus more resources on swimming, since the strategic plan process began a year and a half ago.
The swimming team’s need to bolster its roster contributed to the move. The team, without competitive divers, could not accumulate enough points to make a run at the A-10 title, Nero said. The Colonials finished in fourth place at the A-10 Championships last year, 291 points behind champion St. Bonaventure, which boasts a diving team.
A roster that expands from its current 18 members would allow for more scholarships and the steady player development, he said.
“Diving, we’ve been looking at it a little bit longer and trying to figure out how to add diving back in, just based on a statistical study,” Nero said. “It pretty much showed us that if we didn’t have diving, our opportunities to win the Atlantic 10 Championships were gonna be very, very slim.”
When looking closely at the cross country program, Nero said, coaches and alumni complained that the team’s
that the team’s could not stay competitive because it did not compete year-round.
At last year’s A-10 Championships, the men’s cross country team finished 13th, while the women’s team ended its year with a 10th place finish. Now, they’ll be able to train year round and compete in three different championships: cross country, indoor and outdoor track.
“Right now, our cross country season is so short that it’s very difficult to recruit a high-level runner and then tell them they can only compete one season,” Nero said.
Cross country head coach Terry Weir will extend his duties to the men’s and women’s track teams. His expertise with cross country runners transfers over well, Nero said, to the current focus on long-distance running.
Nero said he did not yet know where the track team would compete, but that Weir is reaching out to local tracks and is close to determining a suitable practice facility. The track team will not host meets, just like the cross country program.
It’s likely that both Weir and swimming head coach Dan Rhinehart will add assistant coaches this year, Nero said, who will focus on track and diving, respectively.

GW has taken concrete steps to make the campus friendlier for gay, lesbian and bisexual students over the past few years. For instance, there’s now gender-neutral housing, an LGBT minor and an LGBT Resource Center.
But GW is letting the transgender community down. It is forgetting about the “T” in LGBT.
Just across town, American University announced last week that student insurance plans will cover 80 percent of the costs of sex reassignment surgery and associated treatments starting this year.
This is great news for transgender students at American, who might not otherwise be able to afford transgender medical treatments, which the Human Rights Campaign says “should be considered medically necessary, reconstructive and not cosmetic.”
But that guidance, endorsed by the American Medical Association – the largest group of doctors and medical students in the nation – seems to fall on deaf ears on many college campuses, including our own. Only about three dozen colleges, including New York University and Cornell, cover sex reassignment surgeries.
Even other colleges that contract with Aetna, an outside student health corporation which GW uses, offer trans services, like UC-Santa Cruz.
For students at these universities, transgender-inclusive policies can have tremendously positive effects. American’s former student government president Sarah McBride, who came out as transgender in May 2012, praised her university’s move, even though she graduated before the new policy went into effect.
“I felt really proud of the institution I was graduating from,” she told American’s student newspaper, The Eagle.
For trans GW students looking for an affordable way to cover treatments, there’s no good news to report.
The question for GW becomes: Does it take a transgender Student Association president to achieve this important step for diversity and inclusivity? It shouldn’t – especially since it seems like, slowly but surely, institutions that want to be modern and progressive will need to offer inclusive health insurance.
The University already has the means to include transgender-inclusive benefits.
Under the existing student health insurance policy students are allocated $2 million maximum per condition, per year, according to the Student Health Service website.
University of California at Santa Cruz allocates a lifetime maximum of $75,000 for sex reassignment surgery. That’s significantly less than GW’s maximum limit, so it shouldn’t be too costly or too unrealistic of a service for GW to offer. American boasts that its policy would not raise premiums “more than a matter of pennies,” according to a press release.
It’s an incredibly small price to pay to relieve the significant financial burden a transgender student must endure to pay for this life-changing surgery or related treatments.
For administrators, the decision revolves around whether or not they agree with equal rights advocates who say the surgery is essential.
So what’s another incentive here, beyond promoting equal rights? Well, GW’s leaders seem to care about rankings. But if they’re so interested in getting the University’s name on the top of lists that matter, they should focus on Campus Pride’s list of the “Top 10 Trans-Friendly Colleges and Universities.” Schools like NYU and some of the UC schools are on this list – in part because of their inclusive insurance programs.
We aspire to be similar to these types of schools in many other areas. How about this one?
Logistically speaking, insurance for sex reassignment surgery shouldn’t be too far off on the horizon. But we need to agree that this is a problem worth solving first.

After dismal participation in GW’s eco-challenge last year, the Office of Sustainability will add monthly prizes this fall to help increase interest in conserving energy.
The office will create a September challenge to reward the hall that saves the most water and energy with a water bottle spigot in its lobby, Director of the Office of Sustainability Meghan Chapple-Brown said. And in October, residents in the winning hall will win food-related prizes, like last year’s behind-the-scenes tour of Founding Farmers, and will all receive reusable water bottles, she said.
The last prize – a sustainable upgrade of the hall’s choice, with options like an energy-efficient television – will go to the winners of the entire competition.
“We’re trying to beef up eco-challenge this year. What’s really critical going forward is student engagement,” Chapple-Brown said.
The move to pique students’ interest comes after more than half of the 30 participating residence halls actually increased their water and energy consumption during last year’s contest.
Chapple-Brown said the office is trying to promote sustainable habits like turning off the lights and not letting faucets run, targeting some of the outreach toward incoming freshmen.
“We’re trying to take advantage of getting students to form the right habits as soon as they get to campus,” she said.

When it comes to crime, sometimes what side of the street you’re on makes all the difference.
That’s the case in D.C., where private college police forces like GW’s have the power to rule on campuses, but are allowed to keep crime details under lock and key.
The Metropolitan Police Department enforces law and order throughout all of D.C., but is required by law to submit public crime reports that allow anyone to scrutinize its work and piece together what exactly happened.
Now, GW wants to go across the street – into MPD’s territory – and take on public responsibility. But they don’t want to accept public accountability.
The University Police Department and other college police squads in the District want to expand their power without playing by the same rules as the MPD.
University officials said they hope the D.C. Council takes up a bill this fall that would give colleges expanded jurisdiction to police beyond their campus boundaries, allowing officers to break up loud parties and collect GWorld numbers. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson tentatively said he would support such a plan.
But no one in the District, including the D.C. Council, should welcome this proposal, especially without explicit legal conditions that would force college police forces to open their books.

The benefit of public crime records
Public disclosure helps create more secure communities. MPD provides detailed information on each crime in the District. Beyond a basic crime log, required by the federal Clery Act, UPD is not required to produce an official incident report – no names, descriptions or narratives.
This patchwork of information and culture of secrecy only creates insecurity. Students aren’t able to take safety precautions if they aren’t sure what precautions are necessary.
UPD has given some indication that it wants to provide clear, timely information by expanding email text alerts and providing some details each week in a brief and temporarily accessible crime log.
But UPD has a less-than-admirable history of keeping students in the loop, further decreasing their justification for expanding jurisdiction.
In September 2011, University police waited nearly six hours to send an email to students after learning about a man threatening to bring a gun to the GW Medical Center to “kill some doctors and patients.”
And as recently as last March, UPD’s secrecy caused speculation and uncertainty after officers took days to respond to questions surrounding drug and alcohol searches at Thurston Hall and residences on Townhouse Row.
The department also does not release its budget or campus patrol routes.
UPD should release open public records to earn the trust of the people it is charged with protecting, instead of persistently keeping students in the dark.
Enforcing off-campus crime?
UPD already has all the authority it needs to keep students safe. Existing laws give GW police the authority to pursue a criminal fleeing off campus.
Pushing more officers into areas of Foggy Bottom not owned by GW would merely divert UPD members off campus instead of achieving their primary goal: keeping students on campus secure.
But according to GW’s top safety and security official, Darrell Darnell, student safety might not be the top goal, anyway.
“It would give us the authority – if we knocked on the door, we could ask for GWorld cards, and who’s in there, just like we do in our residence halls right now. And they would have to produce it,” Darnell said in defense of the new proposal.
This explanation makes it seem like UPD is focusing more on addressing the noise complaints brought about by Foggy Bottom residents than safety concerns on GW’s campus. With hundreds of major crimes like thefts and assaults on campus every year, UPD’s focus should be here.
This is an especially frustrating prospect after a summer of new polices that restrict student freedom but do nothing to promote student safety, including a mandate that juniors live on campus. These police actions, coupled with new plans to expand jurisdiction, are the latest examples of administrative overreach.
Precedent for legislation
The 1990 Clery Act requires all federally funded universities to disclose some police records in a crime log. Recent amendments, such as the mandate to release text alerts on recent crimes, only ensure more openness in university law enforcement.
But if D.C. does go forward with the GW-backed police proposal, it should follow other states in increasing the transparency of private police records even further.
State legislatures in Georgia and North Carolina recognized the importance of open records, pledging to revoke funding from university police departments – at both public and private schools – that fail to release detailed incident reports. These conditions are fair and logical: Campus police that are granted the authority to conduct arrests like public police departments must be held accountable in the same way.
Activist groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and The Student Press Law Center have expressed their dissatisfaction at the plan to expand UPD’s jurisdiction. District leaders should take their advice, and adjust city law so that it is commensurate with more transparent policing rules that keep the best interests of students at heart.

The men’s soccer team battled through an up-and-down opening weekend, due in part to the “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” routine they’ve been putting forth on defense.
In the Colonials’ loss to American on Friday, the back line allowed 15 shots – three of which found the back of the net – and required goalie Jean-Pierre van der Merwe to make five saves. The same defense put on an entirely different show Sunday, shutting down Howard and limiting the Bison to a mere three shots, none of which were in van der Merwe’s vicinity.
For GW, the disparity was palpable, and was the difference between this weekend’s win and loss in the D.C. College Cup.
“We looked a lot more decisive than we did on Friday. Defensively, we got a clean sheet,” head coach Craig Jones said.
The team’s defensive performance will make all the difference for goalie van der Merwe. In a game like GW’s win against Howard, where the defense takes the pressure off the goalkeeper, a goalie’s confidence can remain unrattled, compared to a game in which he is forced to make a number of strenuous saves.
That strong Howard performance resulted in zero first-half shots for the Bison and just van der Merwe’s second career shutout, his first since last September. It was an almost flawless performance against a rough Howard team that averaged 7.1 shots per game last season.
Against the Eagles, however, the Colonials’ defense had van der Merwe scrambling around the box, unable to stop the 15-yard blast, header and 11-yard punch-in that all put American on the scoreboard.
It remains to be seen which unit will show up for the coming games, but if Sunday is any indication of what is to come, van der Merwe can trust he has help with some of that weight. Jones hopes his goalie will be energized by the defensive turnaround going forward.
“He’s been playing well, but we conceded some cheap goals on Friday,” Jones said. “He’s a goalkeeper, so any time he gets a clean sheet, it gives him that confidence going into the next game.”
Part of the inconsistency can be attributed to a lack of time playing together by this defensive unit. There is no shortage of skill on the back line, but injuries have led to instability in recent years and have prevented any one group of players from establishing themselves as the core defensive line.
Junior and reigning team MVP Andri Alexandersson anchors the Colonials’ defense in the center and is expected to play nearly every minute of game time this season. He has been joined chiefly by classmate Matthew Scott, senior Abdul Shaban and rookies Miles McClearn, Tobi Adewole and Sam Summerlin on the back line thus far.
Scott was an Atlantic-10 All-Rookie selection in 2011, but missed all of last season with an injury. His return could prove valuable, but at the same time, the missed play is a potential cause for concern.
Shaban brings experience as well, but also missed significant playing time with an injury last season. He entered the game as a substitute on Friday, but started on Sunday, and his senior leadership in the presence of many young players may lead to good results.
Until the younger players, like McClearn and Adewole, have a chance to get to know each other better on the field, it seems that Jones’ move to put more experience on the back line will be effective.
The Colonials’ next chance to improve upon their communication and defense comes on the road this Friday against LIU Brooklyn, and Sunday against NJIT.
“Next weekend will be a tough road trip, and we need to keep that momentum going, just one game at a time,” Jones said.

Before last fall, University Police Department officers didn’t hesitate to break up fights, knock on doors or write up intoxicated students a few blocks off campus.
That’s because for longer than UPD Chief Kevin Hay has been at GW, responding to off-campus incidents was a regular duty, according to interviews with two current officers.
“It was literally a rule in the police handbook, with our standard operating procedures, that said: ‘Go knock on doors’,” said one officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The private police force is not part of the Metropolitan Police Department fleet, and is technically not allowed to operate outside campus grounds unless chasing a suspect, even to bust parties thrown by GW students.
UPD had skirted that law until officers were reprimanded by the city last year. New accounts from officers show just how much GW’s top brass had stressed off-campus policing.
The University recently announced a plan to regain its off-campus authority, and this time it’s legal.
GW is banding together with 13 other schools to expand campus police jurisdiction, which would allow officers to take action off campus but hold onto their records. GW, the city’s largest university, has said it is looking to give UPD’s more than 100 uniformed officers the authority to crack down on loud parties and other incidents that may arise just beyond the campus line.
Senior Associate Vice President for Safety and Security Darrell Darnell said GW wants to see expanded jurisdiction – whether it’s “three blocks, five blocks or only to those houses where we have students” – so that officers can knock on doors and report students who violate the Student Code of Conduct.
For now, GW staff members will take on neighborhood patrolling duties, administrators told neighbors. But Hay said at a meeting with neighbors in July that the expanded jurisdiction would help the campus police deal with rowdy students.
“We believe being able to knock on the door while the party is in full force is the best way to go, because it will give you more immediate gratification,” he said. “That’s how we’d like to proceed – if we can get all other universities to join forces with us, we think we have a decent chance.”
Officers afraid to step outside jurisdiction
This expanded jurisdiction would put UPD back in line with its old policies, when officers went off campus almost every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night, mostly to townhouses two blocks behind the Foggy Bottom Metro station. When officers received calls from local residents about noise, they would issue warnings to students and sometimes also to people unaffiliated with GW.
The two UPD officers interviewed said they never entered a home, but would sometimes ask students to hand over their GWorlds, though the officers weren’t sure what officials up the chain did with the information they collected.
D.C. officials began to catch on to the long-standing UPD practice last fall. MPD suspended two officers after they breached their authority in two separate incidents off campus.
The University quietly ignored the clash with the city, and announced a new policy to respond only to on-campus incidents this spring, then refused interviews with The Hatchet to explain the policy change.
A year later, officers say they still avoid confronting students or neighbors anywhere off campus grounds to avoid consequences from the city.
“Like, people were afraid to help people in the street who were stumbling or vomiting or – like, ‘Oh, there’s a fight in the street. Well, I can’t go’,” the first officer said.
UPD’s chief is still declining to talk about off-campus policies or how officers responded to noise complaints in the past.
“I don’t want to get into it a whole lot because we are trying to move forward with legislation,” Hay said in an interview this fall. “I don’t see it as being productive at this point.”
Starting to ‘look more like the MPD’
With a bill possibly heading to the D.C. Council after legislators return from their summer recess, legal experts say they are watching developments closely.
Robert Becker, an attorney and board member of the D.C. Open Government Coalition, said if a UPD officer knocked on the door of a student who lived off campus today, the student could turn the officer away.
“Because the student who lives off campus has the right to privacy, you have no obligation as an individual to talk to the police or to give your information,” said Becker, who was also a professor at GW.
He said municipal police forces, like MPD, must have “reasonable suspicion” that a person has committed a crime before they ask for an individual’s information. But Becker said if UPD, a special police force, began to operate like city police, he would expect officers to abide by the same benchmarks as local law enforcement.
The Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, which includes GW, has not yet hashed out a specific policy or set a timetable for legislation. But if that effort moves forward, multiple civil rights and legal groups have said they’d try to strike down or alter the proposal.
“Depending on what they come up with as a bill, then there may be some room for negotiation, particularly when they have to deal with people off campus, because then they are beginning to look more like the MPD than the campus police,” Becker said.
‘A fully-fledged police department’
The first UPD officer said the push to expand jurisdiction goes back several years, when Dolores Stafford served as chief of the department and sought concurrent jurisdiction for D.C. colleges’ police departments.
“The bigger issue is we – not we as in GW, but the universities – have all been trying to get concurrent jurisdiction for years,” the first officer said, which “means being able to be a fully-fledged police department where we could go somewhere else and assist.”
This system would allow UPD officers to share jurisdiction with MPD, which has authority over public D.C. land.
UPD can enforce, arrest and carry weapons other than guns on GW’s campus, or off the grounds when chasing a suspect, under city law.
But campus police officers can also exert their authority in areas “immediately adjacent” to the property they are commissioned to protect, and the first UPD officer said the interpretation of this law has stirred controversy.
The first officer said the department operated under an “agreement” between University officials and neighbors that allowed the officers to respond to noise complaints and was meant to ease tensions with neighbors.
“Our administrators told us that MPD was aware of what we were doing, and they wanted us to go back there, and that was that, and that was what we did,” the second officer said.
The officer added: “The University would tell the residents back there that if they had problems with GW students, that they should call UPD, and they were never shy about doing that.”
Still, off-campus incidents were far from the top of the first officer’s priority list, especially without a weapon for self-defense.
“I have bigger fish to fry on campus. And that’s just kind of my personal view, but my focus was not off campus at all,” the officer said.
