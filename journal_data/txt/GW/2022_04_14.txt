Evans faced calls for expulsion from other Council members in 2019 after it was revealed he touted his influence as a government official to gain business for his consulting firm. 
Former Ward 2 Council member Jack Evans will not face prosecution after a federal investigation into ethics violations he committed during his time on the D.C. Council ended, his attorney announced Wednesday.
Evans – who represented Ward 2, which encompasses Foggy Bottom, beginning in 1992 – resigned in 2020 after repeated calls from Council members amid ethics investigations into his private business dealings while in office. The District’s Board of Ethics and Government Accountability fined Evans $55,000 last July, requiring him to pay the fine in monthly $2,000 increments over the next two years.
“The U.S. Attorney’s Office confirmed yesterday that its investigation of former Councilperson Jack Evans has been concluded and no action will be taken against him,” Evans’ attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement.
Evans faced calls for expulsion from other Council members in 2019 after it was revealed he touted his influence as a government official to gain customers for his consulting firm, which resulted in a $20,000 fine. Evans also crafted legislation to benefit sign company Digi Media just a month after his consulting business was given shares of that company, which led to a $35,000 fine.
Evans resigned just days before a vote to expel him from the Council was scheduled, and Brooke Pinto won the special election last June to replace Evans as Ward 2’s Council member.

The nkatenkwan stew is served in a large bowl with a generous piece of fufu and substantially sized pieces of chicken still on the bone.
Soothe your end-of-semester nerves with a bowl of aromatic and creamy stew at Bukom Cafe, a long standing Adams Morgan restaurant serving traditional West African cuisine.
The restaurant’s name – which comes from Bukom Square, the lively and vibrant city center of Accra, Ghana – is an apt one given its location on bustling 18th Street in Adams Morgan. While the restaurant industry is known for its low survival rates, Bukom Cafe is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, heading into a new decade as a staple in Adams Morgan’s bustling neighborhood.
Bukom Cafe’s storefront is simple but colorful with bright yellow signage hanging over the building and printed decals of the Ghanaian flag stuck to the windows. Its interior consists of two floors with plenty of seating at tables and a bar. The decorations vary from lovely patterned baskets hanging on the wall to a painting of a man soulfully playing the trumpet against the background of the cosmos.
Walking inside, you’ll be greeted with a variety of background tunes including Afrobeats, Spanish music and reggae. Unfortunately, I was not able to visit during one of the restaurant’s regular live performances that feature reggae, funk and soca – a music genre from Trinidad, highly influenced by African and east Asian rhythms – but artists are known to elicit dancing from the patrons after 10 p.m.
With a full bar, Bukom Cafe’s cocktail menu boasts an array of intriguing options, a star of which is the mango lane ($8.18) which incorporates mango juice, rum, tequila, triple sec and grenadine. Guests can also choose from a selection of red and white wine and several African beers.
The drinks menu also includes Malta, a nonalcoholic, carbonated malt drink from the Caribbean that tastes similar to beer and is made from barley and hops. You can additionally opt for one of the specialty drinks like the Africa connection ($10) – a mix of Hennessy, Grand Marnier and fresh mango juice.
Looking for a comfort food, I knew I wanted to try one of the stews despite being tempted by the wings and rice option ($11.82). I decided to sample the nkatenkwan ($17), a West African stew made with ground peanuts as a base of tender chicken.
The dish comes with your choice of fufu, pounded yam or white rice. I opted for the fufu, a starchy, dough-like food staple of West African cooking that is typically made from mashed cassava, green plantains or yams. With a soft texture and not much flavor, fufu is traditionally swallowed without chewing and pairs well with bold stews like my own.
The dish came in a large bowl with a generous piece of fufu surrounded by the stew with substantially sized pieces of chicken still on the bone throughout the dish. As soon as the server brought the food, I was struck with the pleasant smell of peanuts emanating from the slightly reddish, tomato-based stew.
I pinched off a piece of fufu and dipped it into the warm, comforting fusion of ingredients and aromatics that created a bold and well-rounded flavor. The ground peanuts made the broth deliciously creamy, quite similar to the texture of a coconut milk-based curry. The spice of the dish was delayed and developed in the back of my mouth – making me think that either habaneros or Scotch bonnet peppers, which are regularly used in Caribbean cuisines – were mixed into the dish.
Be sure to come with an appetite – the portion of chicken was considerable, and fufu is known to be very filling. I left not only content but with leftovers for later.
The stew was a tasty and cozy meal that left me feeling satisfied and excited to return with friends. Head to Bukom Cafe to savor one of the District’s most well-known West African restaurants and de-stress from the fear of finals with some relaxing reggae music while you’re at it.

Fans can expect a new suite behind home plate with memorabilia from the Nationals’ 2019 postseason run, including game-used jerseys, framed photos and the World Series trophy. 
Baseball fans visiting Nationals Park this season can enjoy new dining options, mobile ordering and and a deeper connection to D.C. history and culture as part of a slew of amenities added to the park this spring.
The home of the Washington Nationals introduced a BetMGM sports betting bar, new dining options and a special suite with extensive fan seating to honor the 2019 World Series championship team. Ryan Bringger, the vice president of ticket sales and service for the Nationals, said the upgrades improve the overall ballpark experience for fans as a fresh season of baseball gets underway.
The park’s new fans suite – the FIS Champions Club – is located behind home plate and stretches from first to third base featuring memorabilia from the Nationals’ 2019 postseason run, like game-used jerseys, bases and line-up cards, framed photos and the World Series trophy.
The keepsakes are set up along a wall-to-wall window for visitors to peruse. The suite’s area on the first and third baselines supplies a bird’s eye view of the game below. The club, which was constructed this offseason, accepts reservations for special events and offers ballpark seating.
The park also added a new line of DMV-based chains, including Rockland’s BBQ, Hard Times Cafe, Grazie Grazie, South Mountain Creamery and GW favorites Duke’s Grocery and Roaming Rooster. The new vendors will offer a mix of American and Italian cuisines and provide everything from barbecue to soft-serve ice cream to attendees.
Jonathan Stahl, the vice president of experience and hospitality for the Nationals, said the collaboration with local food vendors is part of a continued effort to connect the Nationals with the D.C. community.
The park unveiled a BetMGM sportsbook and bar just outside of the park in January, where fans can bet as much as they want on any sport. The location is the first sports betting bar at the park with a collection of betting kiosks and TVs airing live sports games like basketball and baseball and the odds for each.
“We’re excited to now add this within the city of Washington,” Chris Gumiela, the vice president of marketing for BetMGM, said. “When you come here pregame as a fan or even when the Nats are away, you’re going to be able to leverage a multitude of opportunities to engage in sports betting on the Nats or on any other sport that you’d like to engage with.”
The Nationals have also launched some new merchandise for the season, most notably the cherry blossom-themed City Connect jerseys – a fashionable nod to D.C.’s distinctive cherry blossom season. City Connect, a collaboration between Major League Baseball and Nike, ventures to capture the bond between each of the 14 participating teams and their respective city through tailored uniform designs.
The Nationals may have traded the fastest player in baseball Trea Turner last season, but that doesn’t mean they’re not introducing speedy new services for ballpark patrons to utilize. Fans will simply walk right through security without placing their phones, keys and other items in a bowl with the park’s newest security upgrade called OPENGATE. If the scanners flag an item, the fans will need to walk through the stiles again.
Visitors to the park can now order concessions through the MLB Ballpark app – a perk that Bringger said will continue from last year, its first in effect. Bringger said fans can now use the app to pay to move to open seats closer to the action on the field during the game.
Though the Nationals are not offering student discounts this season, Stahl, the vice president of experience and hospitality for the Nationals, said students can attend the park’s George Washington University Day on Sept. 18, buying a special ticket to receive a hat adorned with the GW and Nationals logos at the end of the game.

Students sampled cultural cuisines like Armenian lahmacun, a spiced pizza-like dish topped with minced meat and vegetables, at the event.
The International Students Association hosted its first annual World Food Night in partnership with more than 10 other culture-based associations Sunday, two years after the event was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Students gathered in University Yard to sample cultural cuisines native to each organization, play games and watch performances from GW’s dance associations. Student organization leaders said they were eager to share their cultural traditions with more than 150 students who attended.
Tina Peng, a senior and the president of ISA, said she intended to use the event to address food insecurity issues for international students who don’t have ready access to meals specific to their home country. She said she hopes the event will promote cultural awareness for students by bringing multicultural dishes and entertainment to campus. 
“We have a really diverse student group, however, we don’t really see them represented enough,” Peng said. “And that’s kind of the main reason why we invited all of these cultural and identity-based student orgs to sell their food as well as having performances.”
Peng said international students who have since graduated initially planned the event for spring 2020 before it was postponed after the outbreak of the pandemic. She said she had a “great feeling” seeing the event she envisioned as a sophomore finally take form during her senior year.
“Literally a month before I graduate, I was able to actually have this event planned out,” she said. “So it was really nice.”
Robert Naldgian, a junior majoring in French and economics and a member of the Armenian Students Association, said his table hosted games of backgammon, a chess-like game especially popular in Armenia, and served traditional Armenian foods like lahmacun, a spiced pizza-like dish topped with minced meat and vegetables, and small cheese pastries known as borek.
He said the association was there to fly the Armenian flag and teach students about Armenian culture, something he said very few students know a lot about. 
“I’ve met a lot of kids who are Armenian that don’t know about the org,” Naldgian said. “So it’s kind of cool talking to them.”
Katarina Nguyen, the president of Asian-interest sorority Sigma Psi Zeta, said the sorority handed out food like samosas, a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling that is common in India, which was ​​served to about 30 people at the event. The organization was also doing Henna at their table, temporary body art that is a cultural tradition popular in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Morocco. 
“I think it helps them to get introduced to more cultures and get to try more new food,” Nguyen said.

Newly elected SBA President Nicole Karem said she will prioritize communication and adaptability during her term in the year ahead. 
The Student Bar Association Senate swore in its president, executive vice president and incoming senators for the 2022-23 academic year in their final meeting of the year Tuesday.
Second-year law students Nicole Karem and Garret May were sworn in as president and executive vice president, respectively. Karem said she will prioritize communication and adaptability during her term to promote collaboration between the SBA’s legislative and executive branches.
“My biggest goal is to always be someone who you can ask questions to,” she said. “You can say, ‘I don’t know what I don’t know and I don’t know how to find it out,’ and I can say ‘Let me help you.’”
May presided over the senate for the first time in his new role, promising to be “impartial” and adhere to traditional parliamentary procedures to maintain the structure of senate meetings.
“Whether you’re doing things on executive or whether you’re coming here weekly as a senator, we are able to use this experience to learn how to care for each other despite differences on procedure,” May said.
Senators also voted to confirm Thompson Hangen, a second-year law student, as attorney general and OJ Singh, a second-year law student, as vice president of outreach for next year.
The senate also passed a resolution of appreciation for former Executive Vice President Yun-Da Tsai, a graduating third-year law student. SBA Sen. Pavan Patamalla, a third-year student who co-sponsored the resolution, said he wanted to call attention to the research and compilation of SBA materials Tsai performed “behind the scenes.”
“Regardless of the disagreements we may have had during my time in the senate, I know that he truly cares about this law school in an exceptional way,” he said. “And I think it’s important that we recognize and identify service or future sittings of the senate, should they have any need to call upon him because I know he will answer that call.”
The next SBA Senate meeting will take place next fall.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
My time at The Hatchet didn’t begin because I had an itch to become a journalist, nor did it begin because I wanted to rise up the ranks of a student organization on campus. Instead, my trajectory to becoming an editor was born out of a simple urge to have a reliable place to go to, a place where I knew I could see the same people over and over again, and hopefully make some friends. In the second semester of my freshman year, I decided that this reliable place would be the weekly opinions section pitch meetings. 
I began to live for these meetings, constantly tinkering with my pitches, looking forward to some lively conversation with good people. I’m so glad and so grateful that I chose The Hatchet to be my safe place during that lonely time. It’s served me well since then. 
As a staffer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with wonderful people, all of whom were passionate about journalism and even more passionate about the sections that they ran. I had the opportunity to lead some incredible writers in their journeys from writers to staffers, and edit pieces from columnists that I am in awe of. 
As an opinions editor, I have grown to love the complexity and contradictions of opinions journalism. I learned that a pitch is usually approved not based on the strength of the opinion but rather on the strength of the facts in the opinion. I learned that the most focused and specific opinions are often the ones that are most relatable and enjoyable for peers to read.
I’ve loved my time as contributing opinions editor. I can’t believe my time at The Hatchet has come to an end, but here are some people who made all of it possible: 
Hannah: I still remember sitting next to you in our freshman year as you took out a list of pitches, passionately listing them off as Kiran and Renee listened. I’ve been in awe of your passion for the opinions section ever since. Even though we’re the same year, I’ve looked up to you both as a fellow columnist and as an editor. You have always been kind and humble. You’ve been a great friend to me throughout my years on The Hatchet. 
Andrew: We’ve been on this journey together from the very start, and I’m so lucky to have topped my senior year off as your contributing editor. I can’t imagine having a better partner to lead the section with, and I hope you’ve had as much fun as I had this year as we led meetings and worked together. 
Kiran: I remember how much of a pain in the ass I was as a sophomore opinions writer, fighting you on every word and phrase right before my pieces were published at midnight. You were kind and never lost your patience with me, and I’m very grateful. Thank you for always making me feel heard. 
The opinions and cartoons section: I’m so proud of all the wonderful pitches you brought to the table this year. I’ve looked forward to our meetings a great deal. Thank you for your exuberance and passion for the opinions section. This section is alive and well because of all of you. 
My friends and family: Thank you for always reading and championing my work at The Hatchet. I appreciate you all so much.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
Some families have legacies of doctors and lawyers, scientists or centuries-old family-owned businesses, but in my family, how one uses words has always been most important.
My grandmother was a calligrapher who sought all-encompassing quotes to be painted, framed and gifted to people to make them feel special on important occasions. My mom has been a pioneer in her own right as a woman in the media industry, using words to build powerful promotional campaigns and craft stories of human resilience. My grandfather was a voracious reader and purveyor of all subjects and curiosities, and indulged me in my childhood boredom by passing notes at the dinner table. Words bring us together, build and maintain relationships and offer hope for the future.
In this way, it was only natural that I decided to join the newspaper upon my enrollment at GW. I was a shy kid and writing was the best way I knew how to express myself. But what came next is what surprised me – that The Hatchet would change my life. Within my first year as a reporter and staff member, I made some of my closest friends, learned journalistic fundamentals from my impressive peers and became part of a network of creative and driven individuals who work tirelessly to bring quality coverage to the GW community.
I want to reflect on my time at GW, and on The Hatchet, in the spirit of my grandmother – through a few simple quotes that embody my time here. Corny? Yes. Effective? Maybe.
These words have guided my thinking and outlook over the past few years:
Freshman Year: “Life isn’t about finding yourself, it’s about creating yourself.” – George Bernard Shaw
My mom gifted me a mug with these words printed across the front before my senior year of high school. I’m sure I rolled my eyes and said a strained “thank you” as most teenagers would, but this wisdom has inspired me to try new things in college and beyond and to venture outside of my comfort zone. I think culturally, we’ve gotten too cozy with the idea that we need to follow the exact paths of our role models and icons, or that everything we’ve ever wanted to do has already been done before. Well, it hasn’t. And there’s a million and one ways to get to where you want to be, emotionally, physically and professionally. So even if it’s scary, don’t be afraid to blaze a path that hasn’t been chartered before. (Don’t say I didn’t warn you that this was going to be corny).
Sophomore Year: “To be great is to be misunderstood.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson
Reading Ralph Waldo Emerson’s “Self Reliance” in my sophomore year English class changed my life. In a lot of ways, I felt that I didn’t fit in at GW, and was unsure if I wanted to stay here for the remainder of my college career. But this piece of literature changed my perspective: what makes us great is what distinguishes us. Rather than looking to others for guidance, or feeling pressured to stick to the status quo, looking within and being unabashed in your individuality is the best way forward.
Junior Year: “Learn to do everything lightly even though you are feeling deeply. […] Throw away your baggage and move forward.” – Aldous Huxley
You get to a certain point in your shift from adolescence to young adulthood when you have to decide if you’re going to let your past dictate your life, or if you’re going allow yourself to slowly let it shed like snake skin and emerge as someone new. Quarantine was rough and gave a lot of us more time to think than we might’ve been comfortable with. I saw this quote on Instagram one day and it allowed me to reframe my thinking. Not everything has to be hard. Learning and honoring your past is one thing, but harping on it is another. Let yourself be free.
Senior Year: “The hardest step we must take is to blindly trust in who we are.” – Atticus
This is a quote painted by my Grandma and sits in a small frame on my desk that I glance at every morning. I’m still figuring this one out, to be honest. Graduating college really makes you question your place in the world. What is it that I actually like to do? What do I not like to do? Is my sole purpose to work? Where do I belong? Who am I? These are the questions that have been keeping me up at night as of late. I’ve learned that a lot of these questions need to be answered by letting go and just doing, and trusting that your choices for the future will all fall in line – somehow, someway.
Shoutouts to my nearest and dearest:
Sidney: When I first met you in passing at Hatchet culture meetings freshman year, something told me that I had to know you. Maybe I was just really into your chill girl Lululemon athleisure vibe, or maybe I have good instincts. All I know is that I am incredibly grateful that this organization brought me my best friend. You do everything with grace, composure and a calm-cool-collected-ness that was foreign to me until I met you. I admire your ability to invoke the best of those around you and how you bring a universal conviviality to every situation. Thank you for being patient with me in our work and in our friendship. No matter where the next chapter of life takes us, know that I will cherish all of the laughs, late nights, existential chats, Georgetown trips and cross-coastal adventures, always. <3
Tyara: You know those mental image captures you have of key moments in your life? I can still envision you walking across the street after we exchanged numbers to hang out after meeting on a Hatchet photo assignment freshman year. You are one of my first and longest friends at GW, and that has to mean something. You are one of the most creative people I’ve ever met, and your ability to make something artistic and unique out of any task assigned to you amazes me. You remind me of what’s possible and to challenge my inner voice telling me no. Some of my best (and goofiest) memories from college have been made by your side, and for that, I’m eternally grateful. Catch you in the 212.
Sarah Roach: The woman, the myth, the legend. Thank you for indulging my silly ideas (long live the quiz section?) and for empowering me to blaze my own path on The Hatchet. I aspire to be the kind of leader you are – kind, open-minded, patient and proactive, all while having a sense of humor. I’m still waiting for the day you go viral on TikTok.
Anna: My curly-haired queen! Where is the best-dressed award for BONW because you have my vote. I’m so grateful that I’ve gotten to work with you on the paper and vibe so hard as friends. I’ve loved watching how you’ve led the culture section with unmatched creativity and open-mindedness, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for you.
Lindsay P: I am so grateful that you took a chance on me and hired me as contributing culture editor all those years ago. I owe all of the friends I’ve made, fun I’ve had and skills I’ve learned on The Hatchet to you. Your journalistic prowess and eye for food photography amazes and inspires me, and I can’t wait to see you soon.
Sarah Urtz: You are effortlessly cool. Every memory I have with you feels like it was an adventure. I’ll be on the first flight across the world when you become a kick-ass diplomat. Culture girl gang forever.
Mom: Whether you like to believe it or not, you are a badass. So much of who I am is you, and you have inspired so many of my professional passions and personal achievements. Thank you in advance for helping me move across multiple states for the second time in four years – have I mentioned I love you?
Grandma and Gramps: If you took an x-ray of my body, you would find two huge hunks of heart dedicated to all the love I have for you. If there was a World Series for grandparents, you would be the starting batters. Thank you for everything you’ve made possible for me and for always believing in me.
In conclusion, words matter. They define us. They bring us closer, connect us and change our perspectives. They might even bring you your best friends, define your passions and change your life. So choose them wisely.

Chief Justice Yun-Da Tsai said the court will issue a final judgment on the case before May 1 instead of immediately because neither the plaintiff nor the defendant requested a prompt decision.
The Student Court will not release a preliminary verdict on a case about the Student Association’s updated finance bylaws that allowed the finance committee to sanction student organizations Sunday.
Chief Justice Yun-Da Tsai released the court’s preliminary order Sunday and said in the order that because neither the plaintiff nor the defendant requested a prompt decision, the court will procure a final judgment for the lawsuit before May 1. The Office of the Legislator General filed a complaint in the court in February alleging that the finance committee’s power to sanction violated due process because, under the legislation, student organizations can’t appeal to the executive branch.
The defendant, SA Sen. Yan Xu, argued that the senate passed legislation last month that renders the case moot because the finance committee’s power to sanction will expire in June.
The court delayed its initial consideration of the complaint in late February after Xu filed a motion to stay the lawsuit. A day later, the senate passed a new bill to address the issues laid out in the complaint.

For a brief moment in time, GW was without an indoor mask mandate. Although this experiment proved to be short lived, we can reasonably expect that masking will not be required of students forever as the world comes to terms with COVID-19’s endemic nature. But how long we will have to wait depends on our own ability to make intelligent use of our masks – wearing them indoors to limit the spread of the virus and keep students learning in person.On my way to my first class since the University’s mask mandate was lifted last week, deciding whether I would go maskless for the very first time at GW prompted much thought. Wearing a mask would protect myself and my classmates, but virtually everyone in my vicinity is fully vaccinated and at very low risk of serious symptoms. If I kept the mask on, would I stand out in a bad way if everyone else went mask free? The social ramifications didn’t outweigh the health logic, but I did seriously consider them.When I walked into class, that fear had not become reality. A majority of my classmates were wearing their masks, including the professor. I felt at ease at first, proud of my GW community for taking the coronavirus seriously so that we could build towards a safer future when the pandemic no longer interrupts our daily lives. As class went on, I started to notice the students around me who had decided to sit among us maskless now that the mandate was over. My pandemic-wired brain did not like that image. I had spent so long in a system where masks were mandatory and those who entered buildings maskless were breaking the rules, as well as endangering their classmates. In the past, students who shirked their responsibility to mask up sent a message to me that, more importantly than their personal stance on masking, they felt that the rules did not apply to them. In GW’s brief post-mandate era, I wondered if it was still fair for me to associate my unmasked classmates with any above-the-law feelings of entitlement. They weren’t breaking the rules, but they were deciding to be slightly more comfortable instead of taking an action to keep neighboring students from getting sick. Many would like masking to be left to their own discretion, but I have a hard time respecting the “personal choice” of those who have decided against taking simple steps to protect others. It’s easy to be a free rider, but if nobody picks up the reins, we all suffer.I felt frustrated by these maskless students because we have so much to gain from doing everything in our control to fight back against the pandemic. If students can avoid getting sick, they can avoid missing classes or even exams because of isolation. Mask wearing is an incredibly easy step that we can all take to keep ourselves and those around us safe. Students at a higher risk of developing serious symptoms will be protected, nobody will have to worry about bringing the virus home with them at the end of the semester and we can keep D.C.’s hospitals from being overrun with COVID-19 patients. That’s the end goal – slow this virus down so it doesn’t cause major interruptions to our society. So when GW announced that the indoor mask mandate was back after only a very short sabbatical, I was not surprised but disappointed that students need a hard-and-fast rule instead of simple guidance to do the right thing. The reason we still have to deal with this virus at all is that we can’t be trusted to make remarkably low-cost decisions for the collective good. Perhaps if students had continued to mask up when the mandate became a “strong recommendation,” we could have kept cases lower and enforcing the mask mandate once more would have been unnecessary. Going forward, GW needs a substantive enforcement mechanism to keep people from breaking the rules. If the rules are not enforced, there may as well be no mandate at all. I’ve seen GW employees politely remind students at the University Student Center to put their masks back on after they’ve finished their meals from Panera, but that’s a far cry from the oversight that is necessary to make students take the rules seriously. To start, professors need to be serious about requiring masks in their classrooms and asking students who will not mask up to leave class. If GW won’t improve upon enforcement, more students will begin to violate the mask mandate as they grow weary of pandemic regulations. Should that happen, students will have to be more diligent about reminding their less responsible peers about wearing their masks indoors. The people who skip out on the rules need to feel some social pressure to do the right thing.One day, and hopefully soon, the masking issue will once again be a matter of personal choice, but that can only happen if students are willing to do their part and wear their masks responsibly. It takes diligence but also common sense – there are indeed certain times and places where mask wearing has very little impact. Classes or student organization meetings with 10 or fewer students may not be a place where masks are necessary. But in lecture halls, classrooms and public spaces, proper mask wearing is essential. Students must remember that this is a university campus in a big city where people literally live on top of one another. We’re going to have to mask up longer than our rural and suburban counterparts to handle this pandemic.The entire world has been bending over backward to respond to the pandemic’s relentless curveballs, like COVID-19’s alphabet soup of variants, but we cannot allow ourselves to give up and hope that others will do the right thing for us. Every member of this community has to work tirelessly to see that the mask mandate is adhered to through the semester’s final stretch. The ‘I’m just tired of wearing it’ rationale threatens to put us right back where we started.

Officials named Josh Lasky the new director of the Office of Sustainability in a release Tuesday.
Lasky, an alumnus and former Student Association executive vice president, said he hopes to grow the University’s sustainability initiatives like eliminating fossil fuel investments, phasing out single-use plastics and achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, according to the release. Lasky said he wants to improve the University’s initiatives to support communities that are disproportionately affected by climate change and would benefit from improved sustainability policies.
“GW’s sustainability initiatives have much to gain by including underrepresented voices in both strategy and implementation,” Lasky said in the release. “Given the scale and disproportionality of the effects of climate change, GW has a responsibility to consider its reach and its impact both here on campus and communities well beyond.”
Lasky graduated from GW with a bachelor’s degree in 2007 and received a Presidential Fellowship for his master’s in 2009. The release states he previously worked at a social impact consulting firm and the U.S. Green Building Council before returning to GW.
The former sustainability director, Meghan Chapple, stepped down from the post last summer after nearly 12 years working for the University.
As a graduate student at GW, Lasky was one of two students on a sustainability task force that eventually led to the creation of the Office of Sustainability in 2009. The task force and the Office of Sustainability both focus on “supporting efforts in academics, action and research that promote healthy and thriving resource systems for all,” the release states.
Lasky said that coming back to GW is “full-circle moment” and is excited to continue working on the University’s comprehensive sustainability commitments.
