This year's Black Heritage Celebration focuses on dispelling the notion that the Black population is a monolith by allowing student organizations to define what being Black means to them through various events.
For sophomore Talyn Williams, the Black Girl Mentorship Program’s outreach coordinator, this year’s Black History Celebration is an opportunity to uplift Black women through conversations about “womanism.”
In preparation for the BHC, which begins Monday, Black Girl Mentorship Program organized the panel event, “Black is Womanist,” for Thursday. The event will host representatives from groups like the Student Association, Feminist Student Union and Black Men’s Initiative to discuss the everyday experiences of Black women.
“We definitely wanted to do this because it is representative of the people that we cater to, which is Black women on the GW campus,” Williams said.
Williams is one of dozens of student leaders who are using the theme of the BHC, “Black is ___,” to celebrate their identities. Student leaders who helped put together this month’s celebration said they aim to emphasize the range of identities Black students on campus represent with events like “Black is Innovation” by the Multicultural Business Association and “Black is Power” by GW DREAMS.
Williams added that the discussion gives students an opportunity to learn about different student organizations to potentially join if they feel connected to any of the panelists’ experiences or message.
“It’s very important that we have organizations that cater to specific groups, but it would be definitely very beneficial for everyone if we could all just gather around,” Williams said.
In total, about 20 student organizations will participate in this year’s BHC with events ranging from STEM-focused symposiums to a virtual painting night.
Senior William Davis, the president of the Sports Business Association, said the organization’s panel event, “Black is More than a Player,” on Feb. 10 in collaboration with the Black Student-Athlete Alliance will invite four professionals in the sports industry to discuss their experiences as a minority in the field. He said he hopes inviting professionals in roles like sports management and agencies will show attendees that those interested in pursuing a career in the industry can enter roles beyond being a broadcaster or an athlete, which he said is a common stereotype.
“I hope to accomplish for my org, it being a non-Black org, I hope they have a better understanding of the different roles that different minorities portray within the sports industry,” Davis said. “It would be a good event for them to know about the different roles, not only the different roles within the sports industry, but how impactful they are to Black people and minorities in general.”
Sophomore Maya White, the secretary of the Black Student-Athlete Alliance, said “in light of 2020 and how the year took a turn,” she saw a greater call for public figures to speak out about racial issues.
She said the event can foster a sense of community among Black student-athletes by offering an open platform to speak and hear about being a minority in the sports industry. White also said the event will give non-Black peers an opportunity to listen to Black students’ concerns.
“GW wanted to be a part of that, especially our Black students,” White said. “Because I think contrary to popular belief, we are actually a minority within the athletic community so having a space where we’re able to talk about what’s going on and not feel uncomfortable or scared to speak out in front of our other peers.”
Tevon Blair, a second-year graduate student and the president of the Black Graduate Student Association, said he is helping put on an event for Feb. 25 called, “Black is the Future.” He said the event will involve a panel discussion with successful professionals, including GW alumni, in the technology, politics and education industries who are “breaking barriers” by entering White-dominated fields. 
“I want to really push the importance of mentorship and Black people being more than just the positions that we are expected to do,” Blair said. “We can exist in spaces that were not made for us and do it well.”
He said members of BGSA chose young Black working professionals to speak at the event to emphasize the help they received from peers in their community through networking. He said he wants students to realize that together they can all continue to support each other through their professions.
“We want to make sure that our speakers are highlighting that they didn’t just get here in their roles by themselves,” Blair said. “They had a community. They had a network behind them that were supporting them throughout the journey.”
Senior Naseem Haamid, the president of the Undergraduate Black Law Student Association, said the organization is planning a virtual conference from Feb. 19 to 21, inspired by the 1972 National Black Political Convention, to advocate for better representation and access to equal rights in the Black community. He said the conference will host speakers and discussions about “grassroots organizing” and the steps that can be taken to hold President Joe Biden’s administration accountable on issues like health care.
“We are creating a space dedicated to a conversation around the Black political agenda during a time of unrivaled turmoil,” Haamid said. “The organizers of this event believe that although we are facing grave challenges, our country is on the precipice of change – on the cusp of a multi-racial democracy.”
The organization, in collaboration with the GW Association of Black Journalists, will also host a conversation with White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor about her journey being a reporter and the future of political journalism on Feb. 19, according to the BHC schedule.
Haamid said it brings him “joy” that the BHC is continuing this year in an online format, which he said is necessary during this “historical time.”
“Even in the virtual space, all of the Black organizations on campus have come together and collaborated and have worked toward making sure this happens,” Haamid said.

Byron Kerr, the Colonials' play-by-play announcer, started his career as a commentator for high school basketball games before announcing for George Mason's home games.
For as long as he can remember, Byron Kerr had a knack for sports commentary.
As a kid, Kerr said he would turn down the volume on his TV while watching NBA games, take out his cassette player and call the games himself. While shooting hoops on his own, Kerr said he would call out the play-by-play in his driveway.
Today, Kerr serves as the play-by-play announcer for men’s basketball on the radio, and more recently, ESPN+. Now 15 years into the gig at GW, Kerr still considers calling Colonials games a “dream job.”
“I always remember that moment when the first ball goes up to begin a season, and I get the butterflies in my stomach because I’m like, ‘This is so much fun,’” Kerr said. “I’m really lucky to be able to be the voice of GW and to call games.”
He got his start behind the mic while a student at Virginia. Kerr was the public address announcer for non-revenue sports, and he spent time as a sports anchor at a college station. For his first job after graduation, he called play-by-play for high school basketball games.
Then in the early 1990s, Kerr broke into the Atlantic 10 scene as an expert commentator for George Mason’s home men’s basketball games. After a few years, he became the team’s primary play-by-play announcer – a position he held for more than a decade.
While with the Patriots, Kerr became acquainted with GW’s play-by-play announcer, Larry Michael, who he asked to give a heads up if the position to call games for GW became available.
The job opened up in 2005, when Michael moved on to become an announcer for the now-Washington Football Team, and Kerr soon found himself calling games for a men’s basketball team that finished 27-3 during the 2005-06 season.
“They were just an amazing team,” Kerr said. “That shot put me into that, and I’ve been with the Colonials ever since and really, really loved calling the games and coming to Foggy Bottom.”
But as with most aspects of life throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Kerr’s broadcasting routine has changed this year. In addition to men’s basketball, Kerr added women’s basketball games to his docket, and he undergoes regular COVID-19 testing and wears a mask while speaking into the microphone.
With restrictions to both access and travel, Kerr now only handles home games, which he said has affected his relationship with players and coaches that help him see how the team is progressing on and off the court.
“When I’m traveling with the team, I get an inside view of how the players are doing, what’s going on with the coaches,” Kerr said. “I get to go to the shoot arounds and practices to see what the emotion of the season is, what they’re working on, what they’re trying to improve on, how the players who are injured are trying to get better. None of that is available right now.”
Aside from restricting his behind-the-scenes access, the safety protocols in place at the Smith Center have also shifted Kerr’s day-to-day routine. Taking a COVID-19 test each week prior to games, Kerr said he now only interacts with two or three people every time he calls a game.
“As a father of three children and a wife at home, you definitely get nervous going out into the world and hoping that you don’t contract something like COVID-19,” he said. “But being tested once a week kind of makes me feel a little bit better.”
Along with the weekly testing, Kerr wears a mask at all times inside the Smith Center and keeps hand sanitizer nearby. Unlike past seasons, he said he now needs to remain cognizant of when his mask rubs against the microphone during broadcasts. Kerr’s vantage point has also shifted from a courtside view to the upper corner of the Smith Center.
“You have to stand up sometimes to see what’s going on on the baseline,” Kerr said. “It’s a little bit different.”
Kerr added that the most stark difference for him and the student-athletes has been adjusting to the absence of fans inside the Smith Center. Nowadays, the public address announcer reads the starting lineup to cardboard cutouts of fans rather than George’s Army in the student section and the other attending fans.
“That’s the toughest part, I think, is being unable to have the fans enjoy those moments,” Kerr said. “The players feed off the fans in the stadium, so they have to generate their own emotions sometimes because they don’t have the students. They don’t have fans there to help them through a tough time.”
Despite the adversity this season, Kerr said he still “loves” calling GW games. Without fans watching the action in person, Kerr said his role has only become more important.
“It’s a valuable position to be in, to try to help people see how the teams are doing and what they’re doing in the games,” Kerr said. “That’s exciting for me to be able to have that responsibility to pass on all that information, to help people, at least for a two hours, escape what they’re going through and root for GW.”

Junior guard Maddie Loder looks for an open teammate during a women's basketball game against Duquesne last February. Loder was the only Colonial to notch more than 10 points during a game against Richmond Friday.
For the second game in a row, women’s basketball held the lead in the second quarter. But a free throw and a triple from Richmond junior guard Claire Holt spurred a 10-0 run, and GW watched its lead and the game slip away Friday.
The Spiders (9-4, 6-2 A-10) outscored the Colonials (4-11, 1-8 A-10) in the final three quarters to nab a 60–49 win. GW has now dropped four straight games and sits in 13th place in the Atlantic 10.
Both offenses were sloppy – GW committed 21 turnovers and the Spiders coughed it up 25 times. Despite the loss of possessions, Richmond was efficient with its shooting, knocking down 44.4 percent of its shots compared to GW’s 30 percent.
“The turnovers really hurt us and that was getting spread around with everybody on our team,” head coach Jennifer Rizzotti said. “It was nice that we were only down four at the half after having so many turnovers but still disappointed that we played so sloppy in the first half because we need those cushions.”
GW again struggled from long range, draining two of its 15 attempts from downtown, which allowed the Spiders to put its resources into double or triple-teaming freshman center Ali Brigham. Brigham averages 11.5 points per game on 50.3 percent shooting to lead the Colonials, but she scored just eight points on 3-of-10 shooting Friday.
Junior guard Maddie Loder was the only Colonial in double figures with 13 points. Graduate student guard Jasmine Whitney aided the defensive effort with a floor-leading seven steals and six assists.
“She really puts it all on the line for us and just gives everything that she has,” Loder said. “We’re all trying to be like Jasmine. If we could all be a little bit more like Jasmine, I’m not sure we would be in this position, but it’s great to have her here.”
Richmond saw offensive contributions across the board. Eight different players scored against the Colonials, and three Spiders notched double-digit efforts. Freshman forward Addie Budnik led the way with 13 points, Holt contributed 11 points and junior guard Kate Klimkiewicz added 10 points. Sophomore forward Elaina Chapman led all players with 11 rebounds.
Loder opened the scoring by converting an and-one from beyond the arc for a quick 4–0 Colonial lead. After a quick 10–3 Richmond run, Loder was able to tie the game at 10 thanks to another and-one following a layup with less than five minutes remaining.
Just more than a minute later, freshman forward Caranda Perea found Brigham under the rim for her first points of the night and a 12–10 GW lead. Klimkiewicz tied the game with less than a minute remaining, but Perea hit nothing but net on a midrange jumper to edge the Colonials back in front 14–12 heading into the second quarter.
After Brigham converted a layup that extended GW’s lead to four points early in the second frame, the Spiders kicked into high gear. Richmond tacked on unanswered 10 points while the Colonials did not score for a nearly six-minute long stretch.
Loder and redshirt junior forward Neila Luma scored back-to-back buckets to stop the drought and reduce Richmond’s lead to 22–20, but a triple from Holt with two minutes remaining helped give the Spiders a 27–23 advantage at the half.
The Colonials ended the first half shooting 27.3 percent from the floor and 16.7 percent from deep, while Richmond hit 37.5 percent and 26.7 percent, respectively.
The initial stages of the third quarter brought further success for the Spiders. A layup from Chapman midway through the frame gave Richmond a 39–29 lead, its largest of the game so far.
After Chapman’s bucket, the Colonials cobbled together a 7–2 run, highlighted by a triple from freshman guard Aurea Gingras, to trail 41–36 going into the final frame. Despite staying within striking distance of Richmond after the third quarter, the Colonials could not keep up as the game wore on and fatigue set in.
“We need to be able to be up so that when we get tired we can give up a few buckets and still be OK,” Rizzotti said. “We can’t keep sitting there. It’s like every game – it’s like a six, eight-point lead – and we fight to get it to five, and then they hit a big bucket, and it’s back to seven.”
A pair of free throws from Whitney made it a one-possession game, 47–44, with less than six minutes left to play. But that would be the closest the Colonials would get to a comeback.
The Spiders were able to answer every GW bucket. Budnik’s six points in the final five minutes were more than GW scored as a team, and Richmond sank its late free throws to secure the victory.
Loder said the team’s goal is to go 7-1 over its next eight games, and the team will “keep fighting” for the outcome.
“This is a team that doesn’t give up and I know that our record may not show how good we are, but I can promise you that we’re not going to give up,” Loder said. “We’re not just going to keel over and die because of our record.”
The Colonials will host VCU in their next matchup Monday afternoon. Tipoff is set for 2 p.m.

As COVID-19 displaces thousands of students from campus, student dining representatives are raising awareness of easy-to-make recipes over social media.
GW Dining student representatives are shifting their engagement entirely to social media during remote instruction.
Dining representatives said they have doubled down on GW Dining’s social media usage with recipes, tips and resources for healthy food options around campus. The students said they hope their engagement helps students struggling to find affordable takeout options or easy recipes to cook as the pandemic continues to keep people homebound.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said the student representatives are “active members” of GW Dining, and officials maintain communication with them via WebEx, emails and phone calls. She said the students meet “regularly” with staff members to discuss ideas for students’ dining options during the pandemic.
“The University dining program remains committed to serving all students nutritious meals during the pandemic, including those that follow specific diets,” Nosal said in an email. “Students are encouraged to take advantage of the Dining program’s resources, including contacting GW Dining representatives, visiting the Dining website or getting in touch with Dining staff members directly.”
Peyton Wilson, the Mount Vernon Campus’ student representative, said her role before the pandemic still involved social media but also included organizing in-person activities on the Vern, like cooking classes and contests.
While the Vern remains shut down, Wilson said she’s focused on cooking and posting healthy recipes on Instagram, which she focused on Southern meals like biscuits, cornbread and sweet potatoes. She said she hopes her Instagram posts motivate students to cook their own meals at home, adding that preparing food can serve as a form of self-care during the pandemic.
With at least 35 GWorld vendors closed due to the pandemic’s financial impacts, including Pelham Commons on the Vern, many students are grocery shopping and cooking their own food, she said. Wilson said she hopes posting recipes and tips on her Instagram will make it easier for students to find and make healthy food options.
Of the GWorld dining options that remain, Wilson said she recommends Beefsteak and Surfside as “filling” and “affordable.” To find other affordable options, she suggests turning to Grubhub, from which students can buy food with no delivery fee.
Jess Squires, the student representative for sustainable dining, said the pandemic has forced her to brainstorm new ways to make takeout packaging more sustainable. Squires, who joined the representative program during the pandemic, said she recommends students prioritize cooking at home or use recyclable utensils and bags when eating out.
“I’ve definitely been trying to focus more on just suggesting meals and services that are available to students, not only in Foggy Bottom but all over the country and the world, so that’s obviously a bit more home-cooking than takeout,” she said. “Dining in person is not really an option right now, which is too bad because that’s so much more sustainable than takeout.”
Squires said she has recently focused on posting sustainable meal suggestions and food services that are available to students on and off campus on Instagram. She said her page is focused on home cooking instead of takeout.
When students don’t have time to cook their own meals, she said asking restaurants to leave out utensils and napkins in an order could make takeout more sustainable. She said she is currently working to figure out which GW Dining partners have the most sustainable packaging, a new focus of hers since the pandemic started.
Squires said she also recommends that students on campus look into the community-supported agriculture program with the GroW Garden. She said purchasing food from local farmers who are part of the program is a sustainable way to buy groceries during the pandemic.
The Dupont Circle FRESHFARM Market is also still open for students to purchase local, in-season produce, Squires said. She said students can still compost their food waste there, in addition to the GW compost bin set up in Kogan Plaza every Friday.
Jess Flagg, the vegan and vegetarian student representative, said she hopes to update students on events that provide discounted or free food options. She said since the pandemic sent students home, she’s relied on her Instagram account to host virtual cooking classes, post recipes and recommend restaurants near campus.
Flagg said some of her responsibilities as the vegan and vegetarian dining representative include leading cooking classes, coordinating dining events and communicating with students who want to voice issues related to vegan and vegetarian diet availability. She added that students living in Foggy Bottom can find vegan and vegetarian options at grocery stores like Whole Foods and Safeway.
Flagg said students living at home should experiment cooking new recipes and check out their local restaurants for vegan and vegetarian options.
“You can almost always find something vegetarian, and a lot of restaurants have vegan options or options that you can change a little to make vegan,” Flagg said in an interview.

At 450 residents, freshmen are the largest cohort on campus, while seniors are the smallest on-campus group of residents.
Residence halls tripled in occupancy this semester as GW works to bring more students back to campus under strict COVID-19 guidelines.
About 1,500 students flocked to campus for the spring, with 500 returning from the fall and 1,000 arriving for the first time this academic year, said Seth Weinshel, the assistant dean for campus living and residential education. Weinshel said students must follow several COVID-19 guidelines on campus, including weekly COVID-19 tests, daily symptom checks, social distancing, mask-wearing and closing rooms from guests.
“While students are on campus, we expect certain behaviors from our community to help control the spread of the virus,” he said in an email.
Weinshel said students moved into District and Potomac houses and Shenkman, South and Francis Scott Key halls, where students have their own bedroom and share a bathroom with no more than one other student per COVID-19 regulations.
He said students who lived on campus during the fall semester returned to campus the weekend of Jan. 9, while new students moved in over the past two weekends. About 700 students moved in during the first weekend following the presidential inauguration, and 200 students moved in this past weekend, he said.
Freshmen make up the largest group of returning students with about 450 residents, while seniors are the smallest group, Weinshel said. He said officials tried grouping students in residence halls by class year, and Potomac House and FSK Hall include the largest number of freshmen.
Weinshel said all on-campus residents were required to complete a 30-minute online training course about living on campus during the pandemic prior to move-in.
He said Campus Living and Residential staff members reminded residents about their responsibilities through the check-in process and will note it during “mandatory virtual hall meetings” with area coordinators a week after move-in and individual meetings with students during the semester.
He added that officials are planning a “virtual forum” for students’ family members to hear about campus living.
“We really are excited to be welcoming more students on campus this spring,” Weinshel said. “While it was nice to have a limited number of students on campus for the fall, as we bring more students back to campus, it is beginning to feel like life is getting back to normal.”
Housing officials announced in October they would open nine residence halls for 1,500 new student resident applications who would join the 500 students living on campus. Only about 1,100 students applied, and Weinshel said some students have canceled since December because of COVID-19 concerns or security fears surrounding the presidential inauguration.
Weinshel declined to say how many students live in each residence hall and the percentage of filled beds on campus. He also declined to say how officials plan to enforce a no-guest policy in residence halls and how they decided the number of students in each residence hall.
Almost a dozen students living on campus said the influx of residents didn’t raise their personal COVID-19 concerns, and they anticipate socializing safely and isolating in a more focused learning environment this spring on campus.
Haley Stanks, a freshman living in Potomac House, said she decided to move to campus to feel more connected to the GW community while living in a socially-distant environment with mask-wearing and a roommate cap. Officials limit units to two students, except in South Hall, which can house up to four students in each unit.
“We need to get tested every week, which I really like because I feel like it’s protecting everyone in the community,” she said. “It’s exciting to think I could be walking outside of my dorm room and maybe see someone I have a class with that I just haven’t met before. I think everyone is so relieved to be here.”
Stanks said the University’s socially-distant move-in process was well organized. Students needed to choose a designated time slot to move into their residence hall to avoid crowding in each building.
Kay Jewler, a sophomore living in Shenkman Hall, said she decided to move back to campus this spring so she could better experience college life, reunite with her friends and apply for internship opportunities around the District.
“I’m excited that I’m back in D.C. and can hopefully get a little bit of a semblance of what school was like before all of this happened,” she said. “I’m looking forward to seeing people my age again and experiencing the types of things I had gotten used to my freshman year, like having independence or just doing things for myself.”
Emir Johnson, a freshman living in Potomac House, said restrictions like the University’s no-guest policy make it difficult to meet new people, but he said he understands how social adjustments need to be made during the pandemic.
“I feel like it takes a lot away from campus life if you’re not allowed to have guests in your room and stuff like that,” Johnson said. “But I understand that there is also a pandemic, so there are certain things we just won’t be able to do.”
Melanie Campbell, a freshman living in South Hall, said housing policy restrictions were “reasonable,” and she can better manage her workload while on campus.
“Everything is pretty fair,” she said. “This is the first time they are having this many students back on campus during the pandemic, and I think that’s definitely a reasonable restriction at least for the beginning of the semester.”

The Biden administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan includes $35 billion for colleges and universities.
Less than two weeks into office, President Joe Biden has signed several executive actions on higher education, a move experts say is a signal of a major shift in higher education policy coming over the next four years.
In his first few days following his inauguration, Biden extended the pause on the collection of federal student loan payments for borrowers, repealed former President Donald Trump’s travel ban preventing many students from Muslim-majority countries from studying in the United States and proposed a bill allowing DACA recipients to apply for permanent residency. Higher education experts said Biden’s actions will have a significant impact on international student recruitment and higher education finances.
Biden’s proposed bill calls for an immediate cancellation of $10,000 in federal student loan debt and forgiveness of up to $10,000 for every year of national or community service, up to five years. The president has indicated that he plans to ask Congress to act on student loan forgiveness and will not tackle the issue with executive action, as some commentators have suggested.
Rachel Gentry, the assistant director of federal relations at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said Biden’s key actions in higher education so far have been focused on pandemic relief for students and institutions.
“One thing you have to mention is that his top priority related to higher education now is responding to the pandemic and making sure students in schools have adequate support and guidance to weather the storm,” Gentry said.
The Biden administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan includes $35 billion for colleges and universities.
“I do think it is safe to say that passing another COVID relief bill that would include funding and additional support for higher education institutions is a top priority for the new administration,” Gentry said. “I think the administration clearly understands that schools and institutions at all levels are really struggling now and need additional support.”
Martin Van Der Werf, the associate director of editorial and postsecondary policy at Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce, said many universities need money because they were unable to financially prepare for the effects of COVID-19. Universities like GW have taken on several new costs since the pandemic began, from coronavirus testing and contact tracing to modifications permitting social distancing in campus buildings.
Van Der Werf said universities like GW, with relatively large endowments, should increase their payout rates in the short term to fund operations and mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
“I’m of the opinion that endowments are meant to be fiscal cushions for just this kind of thing,” Van Der Werf said.
Officials decided on a payout rate of about 5 percent in fiscal year 2020, consistent with prior years. Administrators are planning a 4.5 percent payout starting this fiscal year, which began on July 1.
One of Biden’s most ambitious education plans calls for public colleges and universities – which would not include GW – to be tuition-free for families with incomes below $125,000. Van Der Werf said moves to make public colleges free would have a significant impact on the higher education landscape, although GW may not face much change as a result of the decision.
“Clearly if college was free then public colleges would see a significant increase in enrollment, and it would have a relatively significant impact on private colleges as well,” Van Der Werf said. “I think a bigger place like GW would be safer because GW has a lot of other different attributes. It is a big research university, urban location and has many programs of study.”
But Biden will face hurdles in trying to enact his plan for public college tuition. Megan Schneider, the senior director of government affairs at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said she is unsure whether Congress will pass that part of his policy platform, given the narrow margins of Democratic control in both chambers of the body.
“I think it’s too soon to tell whether or not Congress will be able to pass a bill forgiving federal student loans,” Schneider said. “It’s certainly a priority of both the Biden administration and many congressional Democrats, but again, many congressional Republicans are concerned with the cost of such a bill and the slim margins in the House and Senate will likely make it difficult.”
Biden nominated Miguel Cardona to serve as secretary of education and spearhead federal education policy. Cardona, a former teacher and commissioner of education in Connecticut who navigated reopening schools in his home state, has not yet received a confirmation hearing.
Schneider said Cardona’s breadth of experience is a marked and welcome contrast with former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was a businessperson before she served as secretary.
“We were pleased to see an education secretary nominee with actual education experience, and while most of the nominee’s experience is in K-12 education, I have no reason to believe he won’t be fully attentive to the needs of postsecondary education and will hopefully, if confirmed, will build out a support team with extensive higher education experience,” Schneider said.

Kavita Daiya, the director of the women’s, gender and sexuality studies program, said she received approval for one part-time faculty member this semester.
Almost one year after administrators implemented a hiring freeze to offset the financial impacts of COVID-19, department chairs said they have struggled to offer enough classes without part-time faculty members.
Provost Brian Blake said he has still been approving certain hires during the freeze that officials had an “absolute need” for, but he won’t feel comfortable lifting the freeze until administrators have a better idea of the status of the fall semester. Department chairs said they often rely on part-time faculty members to teach lower-level courses and leave electives to full-time professors, but the hiring freeze has forced more full-time faculty into introductory courses, limiting elective offerings.
“We want to make sure that we don’t have to be put in a situation where we have to make additional or new extraordinary actions, which is, I think that’s the good news scenario here, that we did some heavy lifting last year,” Blake said. “But at this point, I think we’re in a pretty stable place going into next winter.”
Kavita Daiya, the director of the women’s, gender and sexuality studies program, said since her program only has five full-time faculty members and three regular part-time faculty members, they often depend on other part-time faculty members. She said department officials relied on courses cross-listed with other programs at GW and faculty from other departments to teach some WGSS courses to “add curricular diversity.”
Daiya said the WGSS program has seen “massive jumps” in enrollment in recent years – the incoming class of graduate students increased by 30 percent this academic year. She said she usually relies on “one to three” part-time faculty members each year to support all of the program’s students, but she was only able to get one part-time faculty member request approved this year.
“In spite of the hiring freeze, I was able to get approval for one part-time position because we had some gaps that needed to be filled,” she said. “I appreciate that the [Columbian College of Arts and Sciences] dean’s office is really working hard, and they’re doing their best despite the freeze.”
Daiya said the WGSS program faced a “critical gap” in its offerings on Black and Hispanic feminist and queer studies. She said she previously filled this gap by hiring part-time faculty members or requesting faculty members who specialize in these topics from other departments, but she can’t rely on those part-time faculty members this year because of the hiring freeze.
“I’ve been able to pull this off with the support and goodwill of a lot of people, but this is not right,” she said. “It should not be the case that Black feminist studies in a historically important women’s, gender, and sexuality studies program is getting taught in this ad hoc way. We should have tenure-line faculty who are integrated into the program.”
A group of faculty members launched a petition last week calling on officials to implement a cluster hire of underrepresented faculty members. Blake said at a Faculty Senate meeting last month that he is a “big fan” of cluster hires, but it would be “hard” to implement this year because of the uncertainty of the fall semester.
Tadeusz Zawidzki, the chair of the philosophy department, said officials have not approved new tenure-track or contract faculty hires for his department in “many years,” despite continuously high enrollment in graduate and undergraduate philosophy courses. His department has hired relatively less part-time faculty this year and had to delay hiring an administrator in the department, he said.
Zawidzki said his department has cut back on course sections this academic year, which has made it more difficult for philosophy majors to complete their upper-level course requirements.
“This has adversely affected our majors, in particular, since it’s hard to offer upper-level classes when the minimum required enrollments are raised to 15 per class and when the faculty who normally teach such classes must teach lower-level classes for which we can’t hire part-time instructors,” he said in an email.
Zawidzki said his department has grown class sizes this academic year at the expense of “very intimate, intense” proseminar courses, which are required to complete the philosophy major.
The philosophy department is offering two proseminar classes this semester, compared to the three proseminar classes offered last fall and last spring, according to the schedule of classes.
“This has made it harder to give our majors the experience they deserve and also has forced us to give some majors proseminar credit for other classes, since canceling one of our proseminars made it impossible to meet demand,” he said.
Maria Frawley, the chair of the English department, said “many” faculty and staff have retired from the department this academic year. Under a new “staff sharing” model implemented by Human Resource Management and Development, administrators were able to replace the staff member who retired with one who was already working at GW part time, but department officials have had to make changes to the program’s curriculum to accommodate the faculty retirements.
She said faculty have “streamlined” the English major this year to include fewer requirements, since there are fewer faculty members who can teach courses on a “breadth” of historical topics related to the program.
“We hope students have not been adversely affected in terms of fulfilling their requirements,” she said. “We put a lot of thought and consideration into our curricular redesign so that we felt good about the integrity of the major. That said, there is an inevitable sense of loss when one ponders the opportunities for course work no longer available to students because retiring faculty have not been replaced.”

LeBlanc said he expects aspects of virtual education, like increased reliance on virtual office hours or remote instruction on snow days, to persist after the pandemic ends. 
As campus locked down during the inauguration, University President Thomas LeBlanc stopped his regular walks around Foggy Bottom with his wife, spending much of his time assessing GW’s safety protocols and preparing near-daily updates to the University community.
LeBlanc reminded students in D.C. to be “vigilant” and prepared as security threats led law enforcement to construct an armed fortress around the downtown area. The regular messages from LeBlanc often referenced a quiet campus except for National Guard troops on patrol throughout Foggy Bottom.
“During the inaugural week when we were on safety lockdown, they basically shut down all construction in the area,” LeBlanc said in an interview last week. “And it was the quietest GW has been in my entire time here.”
LeBlanc said staying in touch with the University community on issues like campus security and the evolving public health situation has been one of his top priorities since the COVID-19 pandemic hit last March, and he’ll continue to leverage constant communication in the coming months. He added that the pandemic helped officials learn to be “more flexible” with academics moving forward.
As students moved in over two weekends following the inauguration, LeBlanc said parents thanked him for the regular updates on the University’s operations.
“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had people come up to me, including [the first move-in weekend] when I greeted parents and students, and thank me for the regular communication coming from the University,” he said. “And sometimes the communication didn’t have any news. And sometimes the communication just said, ‘Things are still OK.’”
LeBlanc said he has not left campus since March and is hoping the remainder of 2021 will bring back a sense of normalcy, which began with permitting more students on campus this spring. About 1,500 students are back on campus this semester, a three-fold jump from the fall.
“It was great to see the students coming back,” he said. “Even with appropriate social distancing and masks, it’s just great having more students back on campus. And of course, as we bring more students back to campus, we reiterated with them the important role that they play in keeping our community safe.”
LeBlanc said he is “actively planning” for an in-person fall semester as GW closes out its bicentennial celebration that kicks off this month. Safety will always guide decision-making, particularly the distribution of vaccines in the coming months, he said.
He said once classes are back in person, he expects many faculty will consider holding virtual office hours permanently or even virtual instruction during inclement winter weather rather than canceling class once GW returns to normal operations.
“What I’ve heard from faculty and students both is faculty are more willing to do office hours at night if they don’t have to drive back to campus,” LeBlanc said. “So maybe they could create some more convenient opportunities for students, and they feel like most of what you get out of office hours is perfectly achievable via Zoom.”
He said he also hopes to explore making study abroad more feasible for students by enabling them to take virtual courses at GW while they live outside of the United States. Officials have canceled study abroad programs through this summer.
“One of the big barriers [to studying abroad] has always been a curriculum that doesn’t have the flexibility for you to be gone for a semester,” LeBlanc said. “Well, maybe you could do that if you took a couple of courses online while you’re doing study abroad.”
LeBlanc said officials have been focusing on fundraising efforts to increase need-based aid as GW enters its bicentennial year. GW has experienced some of its best fundraising years since LeBlanc’s arrival while struggling to improve the University’s alumni giving rate, which has historically lagged behind most peer schools.
The federal government allocated roughly $13.8 million to the University in the stimulus package signed into law late last year, some of which must be used for emergency student aid. LeBlanc said he “presumes” officials will distribute those funds in a similar fashion to grants given after Congress passed the CARES Act in April, but exact details are still being finalized.
Officials distributed all of the roughly $9.1 million allocated through the CARES Act to students.
LeBlanc said the funds can also help officials pay for GW’s COVID-19 testing capability and losses incurred during the pandemic.
“That was very much welcome from the federal government,” LeBlanc said. “I think both the students and the University will benefit from it.”
