The pandemic has brought about huge changes in the way GW conducts academics. Not only are students exclusively online for the first time ever this semester, but the way professors teach and conduct exams has changed. These differences might be worth keeping in the long run.
Some differences this semester, like dull class conversations over Zoom, have proven challenging. But others, like take-home quizzes and exams, provide a welcome contrast with regular in-class evaluations. The added pressure of a test-taking environment is gone, and students have more time to complete their tests than they would in a 75-minute class. Even if there’s more work, the extra time given to take exams helps us fully flesh out our responses and as a result, turn in better work. Some of these open-note tests also reduce the impetus to cheat, which is a win-win for students and professors. 
Many students, myself included, dislike the tense atmosphere in a class where dozens of students hunker and write furiously until 75 minutes are up. Not only do my stress levels increase under the time constraint, but the added pressure of watching classmates turn in exams can feel stigmatizing. Being the last to turn in a test can feel embarrassing, even though it should not. When we can turn our exam in online, the pressure to perform in a scheduled time frame is removed and in turn, helps a lot of students succeed. The old test-taking methods are archaic – and they should stay that way for the future of higher education.
Giving students a few days to complete an exam worth a significant portion of their grade is more fair than expecting them to regurgitate information in a brief, in-class window. Even if the extra time means higher expectations for their work, allowing students to draw upon reference material instead of expecting them to have facts and figures memorized means that they can work at their own pace. Like a regular in-class exam, students still benefit from being familiar with the material before starting the exam. Flipping through textbooks or other source material is time consuming, so even though they may have access to it, students may simply aim to finish their work by drawing upon the lectures, readings and discussions.
There are exceptions to this rule, of course. Prospective doctors, for example, may not benefit from open-book exams when they’re trying to diagnose patients on the spot. But for most other majors, rote memorization does not benefit students. Although research on open- versus closed-book exams is still ongoing, at the moment there is not enough evidence to suggest one is superior to the other. One study found that students who took open-book exams performed better and retained the same amount of information in the long run. This semester, more than ever, students deserve a break, and if we end up with the same level of learning at the end of the semester, surely no harm can come of it.
Getting accustomed to taking exams over a few days instead of a few minutes may take some time, but it is worth it to do so even post-coronavirus. Now more than ever, students deserve a low-stress academic environment, and continuing some of the changes made to ensure that atmosphere will help reduce stress in the long run.

Sharbat's medovik, or honey cake, consists of multiple layers of crepe-like pastry stacked atop each other with honey and whipped cream sandwiched in between. 
For a grab-and-go treat to satisfy your sweet tooth, try one of the many Azerbaijani pastries, cakes and coffees at Sharbat in Adams Morgan.
Located at 2473 18th St. NW, the bakery and cafe is one of the area’s newest additions, and if it weren’t for the pandemic, you could walk over to nightlife hubs like Songbyrd Cafe and Madam’s Organ bar next door. Take an Uber or the Circulator, which would drop you off just one block away from the establishment, to get there. 
The bakery occupies a building unit that once housed a frozen yogurt bar I tried out my freshman year, and Sharbat kept the same minimalistic vibe as the previous tenants. The walls are white, and the seats are decorated with colorful cushions and pillows.
Separated into two floors, the lower half of the bakery includes long tables and benches where customers can eat, chat or study, and the upper platform is fitted with a walk-up counter where you can place your order. Customers can also place orders for delivery or pickup due to the pandemic.
I wasn’t searching for a proper meal, but the dolmas, or stuffed grape leaves, and the gurza, or dumplings with minced meat and yogurt, seemed like the best options for those seeking a full dish (both $18.10).
Sharbat also offers some smaller savory snacks. According to the baker, the most popular lunch pastry is Sharbat’s borek, or flaky phyllo-dough puff stuffed with spiced chicken ($6.69). Vegetarians should not worry – I was reassured that the goghal, or cumin- and anise-filled pastry, was equally crumbly and delicious ($3.29).
And for a quick caffeine boost or something to accompany your pastry, Sharbat’s baristas also have you covered with classic coffee drinks like a cappuccino ($3.60) or a mocha ($4.30). 
I was on a mission to find a dessert for a dinner party with my roommates, so I was solely focused on finding an indulgent and decadent cake to share with my friends. I ultimately opted for one of Azerbaijan’s typical desserts, medovik, or honey cake ($5.99 per slice). 
The layered cake looked very much like a stacked-crepe dessert, with whipped cream and gooey honey oozing in between 10 layers of delicate and airy dough. The whipped cream complemented the sticky honey, quelling some of the honey’s sweet flavor. 
The layered cake was also topped with finely ground toasty nuts and warm spices, like cinnamon, similar to the garnish on the traditional Greek dessert baklava. The crepe-like cake, sweet and creamy filling and nut dusting came together to give the cake a sticky, chewy and crunchy texture all at once. 
If you have a more traditional palette when it comes to sweets, you might want to check out the chocolate cake, which is layered with chocolate creams and spreads ($6.49 per slice). My friend who had previously recommended Sharbat to me also said the raspberry cake ($6.49 per slice) was another solid option.
Head on over to Sharbat if you’re looking to explore a new type of handcrafted dessert at your next family dinner.

Julie Thomasian is a member of the GW Armenian Students Association.
A week ago, I woke up to what I thought would be just another day of school – until I looked down at my phone.
Flooding my screen were alerts from local Armenian news sources and messages from my friends and family in Armenia. While I had been sleeping, my homeland Armenia, and specifically Artsakh, an ethnically Armenian, independently established republic, was attacked by Azerbaijan with full support from Turkey. A full-scale war had broken out. In other words, I woke up to a war in my homeland.
When I am located 5,000 miles away from my homeland, living through a war is a feeling akin to paralysis. My mind travels far away from my body, and I am constantly thinking of what I can do next to help. But the ways I try to help never seem like enough, and anything I do is certainly nothing compared to what Armenia is doing for me right now – defending my existence in this world.
This realization weighs me down with immense guilt, and my mind travels even further trying to imagine what it feels like to be in my home right now. I am inundated with different sounds in my head, from the voices of soldiers fighting on the frontlines to the screams of youth my age, and much younger, fleeing to take shelter while their homes are destroyed. Sometimes, it’s the silence I hear while I’m physically miles away while my country is in crisis that is most overbearing.
The silence felt as an Armenian living in the United States right now is deafening. The silence felt as an Armenian student at GW is even louder. How can we be expected to go to class, participate and learn while our homeland is being destroyed at the hands of its perpetrators and with the help of the world’s silence? Azerbaijan’s planned attacks on Armenia have crossed any measure of a mere regional conflict. This is no longer just an issue between two adjacent countries or an agenda that can be silenced in the name of politics. Starting a war amid a pandemic is nothing short of a major humanitarian and public health crisis: one that threatens the entire Caucasus region and beyond, which needs – more than ever – attention from the rest of the world.
War is a public health problem in and of itself. War during a pandemic, then, creates an even greater health crisis. The demand for hospital beds grow, while hospitals themselves are under attack. Medical supplies, which were already running short, become even more scarce. And the destruction of every part of infrastructure occurs, from homes and schools to the water supply and electricity. These destructions exponentiate the risk of disease transmission. With living spaces destroyed, people have no choice but to be forced into close, unsanitary quarters – a perfect milieu for any pathogen, let alone a highly contagious one like COVID-19, to spread rapidly.
It is the morale of the people that suffers the greatest loss from a war during a pandemic. This loss is even greater for a close-knit society, both in the realms of physical space and culture, where the idea of social distancing has already been enough of a challenge, only upheld at the cost of that which everyone now needs more than ever right now: happiness. But how can health precautions, disease prevention or even happiness be on this society’s mind, when it is their very own existence that the people are fighting for?
We call upon the GW community to end this silence. More than anything else, we encourage you to take the time to learn what is happening. Be curious, seek accurate information and learn about Armenia – a nation that has time and time again fought for the struggle of its existence while the rest of the world remains silent. The Armenian Genocide of 1915, in which more than 1.5 million Armenians were killed under the Ottoman Empire, is still denied by its perpetrator, Turkey, more than 100 years later. It is time for us to find our voices and use them as we strive not to repeat history. It is only then that we can become advocates for one another. And it is through this spread of knowledge that this public health crisis will be stopped in time.

Diaz said the Board of Trustees eventually developed an annual budget in the first week of September based on the best data available.
GW experienced a roughly $10 million deficit last fiscal year, but officials said they expect the University to break even this year following financial mitigation steps.
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz said GW’s deficit last fiscal year, which ended June 30, was roughly $3 million less than originally projected, a result of a higher-than-expected summer enrollment and one-time cost reductions. He said the Board of Trustees eventually developed an annual budget in the first week of September based on the information available at the time.
“We finally drew a line,” Diaz said. “We finally said, ‘We need to start managing the operation – we’re going into our fall semester.’ We couldn’t just have a perpetually evolving budget.”
Diaz said in an interview Tuesday that officials didn’t expect GW’s online offerings over the summer would see many students, but the virtual programs “really did take off.” He said steady enrollment in online summer programs helped offset GW’s anticipated budget deficit.
“Our faculty did yeoman’s work to convert a lot of the in-person courses to virtual, and the students jumped on those offerings,” he said.
As the new fiscal year began, the Board granted officials provisional authority over the University’s spending rather than approving an annual budget as uncertainty persisted. Administrators are now projecting a roughly $180 million budget impact as a result of the pandemic this year.
He said this year’s budget does not reflect an annual deficit following administrators’ financial mitigation measures. Officials suspended most capital projects and hirings, froze all salaries with an additional pay cut by some top administrators and laid off hundreds of staff during the first phase of budget cuts, which reduced expenses by $100 million.
To close the remaining budget gap, officials suspended the University’s retirement contributions and will reduce non-recurring expenses and use some of GW’s unrestricted assets. Diaz said trustees gave officials approval to utilize the assets, but it has not yet been determined which assets will be tapped.
“We were still able to land the 2021 budget on a break-even basis, which I think given not only the turbulence but some of the decisions we had to make that had significant revenue impacts, I think that’s an extraordinary outcome,” he said.
The current revenue shortfall projection of $180 million is far less than officials’ model in May, which estimated a $300 million shortfall if classes remained online for the academic year. The change is largely driven by GW’s better-than-expected enrollment levels, which fell just 2.9 percent – far less than the 30 percent drop estimated in May.
Diaz said the financial implications of the pandemic have always been “fluid,” which led to administrators considering many potential actions.
“We didn’t overreact early on,” he said. “We modeled our scenarios, we identified measures that we were definitely going to take, we put other measures on the tables that were really just for discussion.”
Some of administrators’ mitigation steps have been met with intense criticism from faculty and staff, but Diaz said officials have avoided “provocative” measures, like an across-the-board salary cut.
He added that although officials have already announced classes will remain online for the spring, some uncertainty remains, like enrollment levels. Officials sent out a survey to gauge students’ intentions for the spring semester earlier this month, but Vice Provost of Enrollment and Student Success Jay Goff said last week there is “no indication” enrollment will shift beyond normal trends.
“We are still monitoring several data points like a hawk as we move closer to the spring,” Diaz said.

El Tarabishy said officials held 20 percent of last year's events virtually to allow for alumni around the world to participate.
School of Business officials are holding their second annual “Entrepreneurship Week” in a virtual format this week.
Officials transitioned the event, which began on Monday and will end on Friday, fully online in light of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ayman El Tarabishy, a teaching professor of management who curated the event, said the events of this year’s conference focus on virtual entrepreneurship with workshops on telehealth and telemedicine.
El Tarabishy said officials held 20 percent of last year’s events virtually to allow for alumni around the world to participate. He said this year’s entrepreneurship week follows the same “successful formula” as last year.
“We knew attendance will be strong, and it is,” he said in an email. “As entrepreneurs and to act like ones we sought opportunities for everyone and students responded very positively.”
El Tarabishy said the event has drawn more than 250 students for workshops on topics like social and digital entrepreneurship. He said the theme of this year’s event is “resiliency,” which is embodied in the conference as it has been transitioned to a new platform this year with “different communication channels.”
“As this year’s theme is centered around ‘resiliency,’ we wanted the conference to embody the theme, meaning that we were both set to discuss and model resiliency,” El Tarabishy said. “Change-makers worldwide are looking to become more and more resilient.”
He said students have taken on a “significant” leadership role in the conference this year, proposing and creating all of the sessions and inviting all of the keynote speakers.
“We have seen truly remarkable engagement and leadership from our GW students, which has shown us how our students have not just responded to the pandemic but how they have taken on a more significant leadership role to help move GW forward,” El Tarabishy said.

SA Sen. Gabriel Young, CCAS-U, said the legislation will help “expedite” the process of adding the minor and would help express the “importance” of having ethnic studies options for students.
The Student Association Senate passed a resolution calling on officials to implement an Asian American studies minor program at a meeting Monday.
The resolution, which passed unanimously, asks officials to adopt the minor in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and includes a proposal written from CCAS professors outlining course requirements for the minor. SA Sen. Gabriel Young, CCAS-U and the sponsor of the resolution, said the rise of racial justice this summer and the “exposition” of normalized racism toward Asians and Asian Americans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has “revived” the conversation about the need for an Asian American studies minor.
He said the Asian American student body, particularly the Asian American Student Association, has advocated for a minor since 2017.
CCAS professors Patty Chu and Dana Tai Soon Burgess sent a proposal for the minor to CCAS officials earlier this month, according to the legislation. The proposal was released in conjunction with a petition that has attained more than 2,500 signatures from students, faculty and non-GW communities in support of the minor, the legislation states.
He said the legislation will help “expedite” the process of adding the minor and would help express the “importance” of having ethnic studies options for students.
“GW says that it is an institution that promotes diversity and inclusion yet lacks ethnic studies programs,” Young said. “By passing this piece of legislation, you’re taking another step forward in helping marginalized communities reclaim their voices and stories while providing a space for them to learn, convene and study their own histories.”
The senate also approved a resolution requesting officials include text acknowledging the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on all undergraduate and graduate students’ transcripts for the 2020-21 academic year.
SA Sen. Jovawn McNeil, ESIA-U and the sponsor of the COVID-19 Transcript Accommodations Act, said he will continue conversations with officials to ensure the hardships students are facing due to the pandemic are appropriately noted on transcripts. He said officials should adapt the language on transcripts from last semester to be more “inclusive and representative” of the current circumstances students are facing this semester.
“This is to ensure that there is a clear line of reasoning for students suffering from lower than average grades or praise for those maintaining their high grades in spite of the circumstances,” McNeil said.
Young, the CCAS senator who is also a co-sponsor of the resolution, said the resolution would act as a “safeguard” for students so those viewing job applications know of the challenges faced this semester. He said even for those choosing not to exercise the Pass/No Pass option this semester, including a note on everyone’s transcript can be an indication that students tried their “hardest” during this period.
“Understand that this period was rough for all of us, but just remember that grades aren’t reflective of a person, and we are more than just a grade,” Young said.
The senate also confirmed Courtland Ingraham, a first-year law student, as a law school senator to fill the body’s last senate seat vacancy.

Lafayette Hall is one of nine residences slated to house students this spring.
Officials will offer students housing in nine residence halls this spring, according to an email sent to students Monday night.
GW will open Lafayette and Francis Scott Key halls, Potomac House, 1959 E Street, One Washington Circle and The Aston to accommodate the roughly 1,500 students expected to return to campus this spring, administrators said in the email. District House and Shenkman and South halls, which currently house 500 students, will remain open next semester, according to the email.
“Please keep in mind that we are not requiring any students to return to campus,” Seth Weinshel and Stewart Robinette, two assistant deans for campus living and residential education, wrote in the joint email. “We want you to return if you feel comfortable moving during this pandemic and agree to follow both the University and the District of Columbia’s health and safety guidelines.”
Applications for on-campus housing opened Tuesday at 10 a.m. EDT and will close Monday, Nov. 2 at 10 p.m. EST. Officials said students will be notified whether or not they were approved for on-campus housing by Friday, Nov. 20. Approved students will live in residence halls from Jan. 23 to May 12, the email states.
Students may not request the building of their choice to ensure “an equitable process” for those interested in applying for housing, according to the email. Students will also be entered in a lottery system for spring housing if the application pool exceeds the available number of beds.
Two students may live in an apartment-style unit, while South Hall can house up to four students – each with their own bedroom – in a single apartment unit. All students approved to live on campus will receive their own bedroom and share a bathroom with no more than one other student, according to the email.
Officials added that all other residence halls, including those on the Mount Vernon Campus and in fraternity and sorority townhouses, will remain closed. Fraternities or sororities that own their own townhouse, either on or off campus, may receive housing permission from their chapter’s national headquarters, the email states.
Administrators added that the D.C. Zoning Commission “discourages” first- and second-year students from moving to the D.C. area next semester if their permanent residence is not within commuting distance from campus.
The email states that halls with an in-unit kitchen will cost about $6,000, and halls without an in-unit kitchen – Lafayette Hall and Potomac House – are priced at about $5,700. Meal plans for students with a kitchen rest at $1,570 for the semester and $2,445.50 for those without a kitchen, according to the email.
Officials said the housing application includes “a limited number of questions,” and they will consider students’ lifestyle responses from the 2020-21 housing application sent out this summer. Students who are approved to live on campus may “preference” another suitemate before they receive their housing assignment, and first-year students may only select other first-years as potential suitemates, according to the email.
Administrators said they will deliver students their stored belongings to their new housing assignment before move-in day if students extended their storage period during the fall. The email states officials will announce by the end of November how they plan to “reunite” students living at home with their possessions in D.C.
Officials have not yet made a decision about housing options during summer 2021, the email states.
