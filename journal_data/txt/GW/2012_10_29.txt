The University would claim a larger stake of cash from researchers’ inventions under its first new patent policy in 16 years.
As GW looks to grow its research enterprise, it would pull in two-thirds of its share of income from patented and licensed inventions that reap $2 million or more, leaving one-third for researchers, according to new guidelines under Faculty Senate committee review.
It’s the first time the University set a bar for inventions that make over $2 million, a total no GW product has ever collected.
Researchers will still get half the income from inventions that earn less than $100,000 and 40 percent of the payoff for inventions between $100,000 and $2 million – components of the 1996 policy. The rest of the funds go toward researchers’ departments, schools and the Office of the Vice President for Research.
The old patent policy, however, has mostly gathered dust over the past decade as the University has begun trying to make a mark in technology transfer– turning products into dollars by patenting inventions and licensing the rights to companies.
The two-year-old Office of Technology Transfer counted only three patents issued and 11 patent applications last year. Engineering professor Charles Garris said the University generated only about $20,000 in licensing revenue last year, but Jim Chung, the office’s leader, would not comment on licensing income.
Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa said GW is “ramping up” these efforts to fuel its research enterprise.
The changes, under review by a Faculty Senate committee, alter an “outdated” policy shaped before GW had major research ambitions, Chung said.
“GW is transitioning to be a top tier research university and its intellectual property policy needs to be able to accommodate the anticipated new levels and types of research and innovation,” he said. “Top research faculty we are recruiting expect to have well-functioning support services to bring their inventions to market.”
Six universities were awarded more than 100 patents two years ago, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford and University of California.
But as GW tries to turn researchers’ attention toward patenting their work, the new policy could drive them away, engineering professor Murray Loew said.
Loew, who sits on the Faculty Senate’s professor ethics and academic freedom committee, said the idea to decrease researchers’ share of income as their invention rakes in more dollars is “upside down.”
“I think having this reduction in the percentage is sending the wrong message, I really do,” Loew said. “A university should have a patent policy, but this one isn’t as enlightened as it ought to be.”
Garris, chair of that committee, praised the policy but said there will likely be faculty concern about the income sharing plan after it reaches a vote in the Faculty Senate, likely by this spring.
“They’re changing this patent policy with the hope that the University will benefit from this source of revenue, but they won’t benefit from the source of revenue unless there’s an incentive to let faculty participate,” he said. “That’s where this policy has to strike a fair balance.”
Chung said his office scoured top research universities and market basket schools for their best patent policy practices. While most patent policies vary across universities, GW’s new policy doesn’t differ greatly from those at Northwestern, New York and Yale universities.
Chung stressed that the money given back to researchers’ schools and departments “will go back to the inventor’s ongoing research,” helping fueling more opportunities for inventors commercialize their research.”
“It’s a draft that we’re waiting to get input on. If faculty want to change it, we’ll change it,” Chalupa said.
The policy also affirms for the first time students’ share of the income if they work on a patented product.
The University has tried to gather student interest in undergraduate research and sharpened the research focus of its graduate programs in recent years.
“We haven’t had that many things making big money, but now that we’re ramping up the licensing and ramping up the product production with potential companies, we want to make it clear that students should get some rewards for their contributions,” Chalupa said.
But while the policy declares that students have the rights to income if they contribute, it doesn’t spell out how researchers and the undergraduates, graduates or post-doctoral fellows who work in their labs would divvy up the funds.
That could be a hole in the plan, said Akos Vertes, a chemistry professor who invented a laser that provides instant analysis of living tissue – one of the most successful GW inventions in recent years.
“That is a missing link. I can just see when money becomes available, people will start to have different feelings about what the contribution was. Somehow it has to be declared at the beginning,” Vertes, who praised the plan overall, said.

Correction appended
Filth, rodents and mold are just a few unwelcome fixtures in many popular Foggy Bottom restaurants.
Lindy’s Bon Appetit and Red Lion, T.G.I. Friday’s and Panda Café have each been handed 30 or more health code violations since April 2010, with some as recently as last week, according to InspectionMapper.com – a new website that pulls data from the D.C. Department of Health to help people pick out the safest eateries around the District.
The city’s health department checks restaurants without warning about twice yearly.
Foggy Bottom averages about 20 violations per restaurant, the most common ranging from unsanitized washcloths to lack of employee health records and missing handwashing signs near sinks, according to the website.
Lindy’s, a restaurant and student hotspot on Pennsylvania Avenue, had 15 violations in a September inspection in and three violations most recently as Thursday. That makes for a total of 39 violations at the restaurant since April 2010. Fifteen were identified as critical, and included evidence of vermin, smoking in food preparation areas and multiple accounts of unclean food preparation surfaces.
“Every restaurant has problems,” Lindy’s owner Jim Eckels said. “The Health Department comes in here and clues us towards those problems, and that’s what they did.”
He declined to outline the specifics steps he has taken regarding the restaurant’s violations.
Inspections that mark critical violations entail conditions that could be considered detrimental to a patron’s health, like the presence of pests and insects or improper food storage. Other violations are docked as non-critical and deal with restaurant protocol, like placing handwashing signs above every sink.
Mahlori Isaacs, a representative from the D.C. Department of Health, said most restaurants are able to correct violations on the spot during inspections and that nearly all venues are willing to work with the department.
At the T.G.I. Friday’s at the corner of 21st and I streets, inspectors found a handful of minor violations in August that were immediately corrected, including debris on the floor and mold outside an ice machine.
Manager Bamba Sama said that the restaurant, which had 30 violations since July 2010 – including a roach found in the manager’s office – is working with the health department and goes through regular inspections, but declined to comment on specific violations.
Panda Café, along the 2100 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, had 48 violations in the last two and a half years – 19 of which were deemed critical. The eatery had four violations at their last inspection in July 2012, according to the website, including a lack of proper rags for sanitization and debris at the bottom of a sushi container.
Neighboring eateries Mehran Restaurant and Thai Place also had steep numbers of violations – 41 and 30 respectively.
Dia Khanthongthip, manager of Thai Place, said that recent violations in July 2012 – unlabeled food and dirty light fixtures – were minor and were corrected during the evaluation.
“It’s really important for customers that we keep things clean,” Khanthongthip said. Managers of Panda Café and Mehran Restaurant could not be reached for comment.
Several campus eateries hold nearly clean health records. Tonic at 21st and G streets was cited for just two violations at its last recorded inspection in April 2011 – a broken garbage disposal and “unclean food contact surfaces,” which were both fixed on site, according to the website.
“We take cleanliness and health laws and rules and regulations very strongly and very seriously,” Elizabeth Lettic, director of marketing for Tonic, said.
District Commons and Burger Tap and Shake in the 2200 Pennsylvania Ave. complex have committed minimal violations since opening over a year ago, with six and three respectively – one critical at BTS.
Kathy Arvis, marketing representative for the owner of both restaurants, said one violation was due to an improperly mounted ice cream scoop along the wall, which she said was fixed immediately.
This article was updated Oct. 29, 2012 to reflect the following:
A previous version of the map mismatched the restaurants and the violations. We regret this error.

With Hurricane Sandy hurtling toward the Atlantic coast, GW will shut its doors Monday – the first University-wide closure since the 2010 Snowpocalypse.
Showers and powerful gusts greeted the city Sunday night, the starting punch of a harsh storm that forecasters expect will see up to 70 mph winds, 10 inches of rain and widespread power outages.
All academic buildings and libraries, as well as the Lerner Health and Wellness Center and the Smith Center, will remain closed Monday as campus braces for the storm. The federal and District governments will join area universities in the shutdown, and flights and trains have canceled trips in and out of the region.
Administrators were in close contact with the D.C. government and federal agencies throughout the weekend, keeping students glued to social media and GW’s campus advisory page to find out about class
Skies: pounding showers all day
Winds: 35-50 mph, surging to 70 mph at night
Temperature: 40 degrees
Skies: heavy rains throughout the morning, settling by noon
Winds: up to 60 mph
Temperature: as low as 37 degrees
Skies: cloudy and calm, 30 percent chance of rain
Winds: low winds
Temperature: high of 54 degrees
cancellations. The cancellation message hit cell phones and inboxes at about 6 p.m. Sunday, hours after schools along the East Coast began announcing closings – sending students into revelry on Facebook and Twitter, and in some cases, into the streets.
The University has designated shelters – the Marvin Center, the Smith Center and the Media and Public Affairs building – but the Senior Associate Vice President for Safety and Security Darrell Darnell said students would be safe in their residence halls and apartments. Campus dining halls have stocked up and will maintain normal operating hours to feed students.
“If students follow instructions, stay indoors, don’t go outside, stay away from windows, everyone will be safe,” Darnell said.
The Vern Express will operate on a normal schedule as long as road conditions permit, but service could be suspended if the weather worsens, University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said Sunday night. Like the Metro, which cancelled all trains and buses starting Monday, bus service to the Virginia Science and Technology Campus is suspended until further notice.
The hurricane has sent federal, city and University officials in a scramble to respond to the historic – and alarming – storm that will creep up the East Coast and merge with a cold front crossing the Northeast. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency for the District late Sunday.
“Let me be clear. This storm is unique, large, dangerous and unlike anything our region has ever experienced in a very a long time,” Mayor Vincent Gray said at a press conference Sunday.
Crews began battening down campus this weekend, clearing storm drains and preparing sandbags. The Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses are equipped with generators in case of power outages, and the University sent extra generators to the Vern, which is prone to losing electricity during heavy storms.
“Because of the city’s power grid, we seem to always have a problem with the Mount Vernon campus. It’s better to be safe than sorry, so we brought in extra generators for that campus,” Darnell said Saturday night. “Critical facilities” on the Foggy Bottom Campus already had backup generators, he said.
Additional facilities personnel, including police and housekeeping employees, will remain on-call during the storm, Darnell said, and members may be housed on campus or in hotels depending on the severity of the storm.
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority began prepping for the storm Friday by placing sandbags around potential water entry points to Metro rail tunnels and scheduling additional staff to respond to arising problems.
The University also worked with construction contractors to safeguard major construction sites across campus including the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and School of Public Health and Health Services pits.
“[The contractors] have their own emergency plans in place for the storm, especially to make sure the cranes can sustain wind,” Darnell said. The crane at the Science and Engineering Hall construction zone remained secure following the impact of Hurricane Irene in August 2011.
Hurricane Irene forced the University to allow students to move into their residence halls earlier than scheduled to avoid the swirling storm. But Irene toppled only a handful of trees and news stands on campus, largely sparing the District and producing minimal damage.

GW plans to lift a ban on classified research to allow some professors to work with state secrets – a move that could rake in millions of dollars yearly.
For the first time since the Vietnam War, researchers would handle top-secret information related to areas like cybersecurity, homeland security and physics, if the final 10-year strategic plan includes a proposal to reverse a 2003 ban on covert research.
Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa said the initiative – which would likely require a special facility, technology and security detail – also would be pricey, but he could not yet estimate costs because discussions are still in the early stages.
The policy would be a step forward from the 2003 policy that was drawn up in “a different world,” he said.
“We’re a different country than we were nine years ago. The faculty is different. The kind of research they’re doing is different,” Chalupa said. “Our colleagues at other universities feel it’s in the national interest to be doing this kind of work, and we should consider joining them.”
The University has historically shut down proposals for classified research on campus, but it did maintain some secret projects during the Vietnam War era that incited student protests, former executive vice president for academic affairs Don Lehman said.
As it looks to put the policy proposal in front of a Faculty Senate committee over the next year, the University will first have to determine its relationship with the classified research institute. While most schools ban classified research, some universities like Johns Hopkins and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology run their classified research institutes off campus or as separate entities.
Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory is run by the university, and is its only facility designated to do classified research. The laboratory brings in $600 million in research dollars every year, Chalupa said.
Chalupa said he has informally discussed how to implement a classified research policy with administrators at Virginia Tech, which established its facility two years ago.
“[Virginia Tech is] out there in the middle of farm country, and they’re doing classified research and we’re right here, a short ride from the CIA and FBI and NSA,” Chalupa said. “It seems like at least it’s worth a discussion, and that’s where we’re at.”
The policy reversal could set off another debate about classified research, Chalupa said, because the study is based on restricted access to information, a keystone of higher education.
“On the one hand, you’re balancing the well-being of the U.S. That’s a big deal for me and any American. On the other hand, you have the tradition of academia, which is bringing in information and open discourse,” Chalupa said.
Engineering professor Charles Garris, who chairs the Faculty Senate’s professional ethics and academic freedom committee, said the money the research would bring in could help fund academics and further research, but it will open up issues with secrecy.
“The idea of classified research is very controversial,” he said. “There will be new discussions and new debate over pros and cons of it. There could be academic freedom issues there, because if you’re doing research for a classified entity, you can’t publish it.”
The University also likely would have to shut out international students from working on research with state secrets. One-third of graduate students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science are international students.
Timothy Wood, an assistant professor of computer science, said he supported the idea because his research on how to manage massive computer systems draws interest from intelligence agencies. But leaving out foreign graduate students would put up a logistical hurdle, he added.
“It’d be a tricky thing to figure out, because most of our graduate students are international. It’d be difficult to get the manpower for people to work on these projects, because we don’t have enough domestic students to work on this project in the first place,” Wood said.
Mark Reeves, a physics professor, said the benefits of a classified research enterprise would far outweigh the concern by allowing GW researchers to tackle crucial national security problems.
“My dad did classified research in the Nevada Test Site, and he couldn’t go home and talk to my mom about it,” Reeves said, referring to the Department of Energy nuclear testing project conducted in the 1950s. “It was just one of those things. He still made a huge contribution.”

José Andrés, one of the world’s most acclaimed and influential chefs, will teach his first course at GW next semester.
The 43-year-old Spanish culinary icon is considered larger-than-life in the restaurant world. He will help teach a course called “The World on a Plate: How Food Shapes Civilization,” the University announced Monday. It will be open to 230 undergraduate and graduate students.
Andrés will teach “some” classes in the 1.5 credit course, according to a release. Classes will focus on examining the connections between food and society, including the history of food, issues of hunger and obesity, and food and national security.
GW faculty and guest lecturers will teach the rest of the classes, with a line-up of lecturers that includes Andrew Zimmeran, the host the Travel Channel series “Bizarre Foods,” along with federal food officials.
Classes will be held Mondays from 4 to 5:20 p.m. in Jack Morton Auditorium.
“Eating is the one thing, besides breathing, that we all do from the day we are born until the day we die. Food is that thread that runs through the fabric of society,” Andrés said in a release. “I could not be more proud than to bring this idea – an education course focused on the power of food and how it changes the world – to life here at GW.”
Andrés was also named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people this year. His legion of five top D.C.-area restaurants include minibar and Jaleo, which often serves First Lady Michelle Obama. He also won the James Beard Award last year, the top U.S. honor for a chef.
The Spain native has already built ties with GW, sitting on its urban food task force, which promotes sustainable food production, healthy eating and food policy. He’s also worked with the School Without Walls, the public high school on the Foggy Bottom Campus, to create a food and nutrition curriculum.
Andrés is not a novice in higher education. In 2010, he co-taught a course in culinary physics at Harvard University, and he still lectures in its public series on cooking.
“José Andrés is internationally renowned both as a culinary innovator and a visionary humanitarian,” University President Steven Knapp said in a release. “We are delighted that this new course will bring his passion for connecting food and education to our students.”
It will be the second consecutive spring semester that a high-profile figure will teach at GW. Last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke taught a lecture series to undergraduates in the GW School of Business.
Denis Cioffi, director of GW’s Teaching and Learning Collaborative, who will oversee the course, called it a chance for students “to discuss critical decisions that need to be made regarding food.”
“This class helps make connections between disciplines often viewed in isolation – like science, history, culture, politics and security – and will encourage problem-solving on multiple levels,” Cioffi said.

On a college campus like GW’s, it’s expected that students will be loud and boisterous. Students love a good party on Friday nights, even if the noise is bound to upset the locals.
Conflict between University students who live off campus and local residents is nothing new. It’s a problem that persists across all college towns. But at some point, enough is enough.
Last week, an off-campus student threw a beer can at a permanent resident. And that was not the first time locals have reported disruptive and disorderly behavior. In response, some neighbors have compiled a list of apartments and townhouses where so-called noisy students live, and they plan to give that list to the University.
Foggy Bottom’s permanent residents are justified in their complaints. We all know it is ridiculous to fling beer cans, destroy private property or host the entire student body in a one-bedroom apartment.
But to compile a list of residences unfairly places all students in the same group. Not everyone is reckless, and the group as a whole should not be treated as such.
Instead, there are other, more productive means to deal with residents’ grievances. Just talk to your neighbors if you have an issue with their behavior. We’re all grown-ups – though students may not always act like it – and open lines of communication will ensure everyone’s needs are met.
The University should not have to serve as a mediator for these kinds of conflicts. Off-campus noise complaints are outside the University Police Department’s jurisdiction, and it should gear efforts toward enforcement and protection on campus – not off campus, where UPD’s presence is neither appropriate nor warranted.
Permanent Foggy Bottom residents should treat student neighbors just like any other neighbors. And the neighbor-to-neighbor relationship could be further strained if the University intervenes and patronizingly hands out pamphlets on proper behavior.
Regardless of our status as students or professionals, we all live here. We pay rent. We take out the trash. We have jobs and obligations. We are all residents of the District, and nobody should be treated differently from anyone else.

I’m probably one of the few students who has yet to try a pretzel from Auntie Anne’s, the latest addition to our ever-changing campus dining hall, J Street.
It’s partly because I’m wary of developing the addiction others on campus already have. But mostly, it’s because I rarely eat at J Street.
For the past several years, J Street has tried everything in the book to boost its image, swapping out Chick-fil-A and Wendy’s for venues like Metro Diner and BONMi and launching a marketing campaign. Now, the food provider Sodexo is piloting a new smartphone app for a dozen universities that will offer discount deals and loyalty rewards to students.
The idea seems to be that maybe Sodexo can attract students’ attention with special offers.
It’s sad that the dining hall must resort to a rewards program that nearly amounts to bribery to attract students.
A rewards program is a half-hearted solution to the root of the problem: J Street meals are too expensive. Students pay for food at the buffet based on weight, making meals pricier than they would be with a per-meal swipe system, which other schools offer.
The Student Dining Board is also trying to create a GW-centric program similar to Groupon and LivingSocial, which would offer special deals for Sodexo-affiliated venues and GWorld partners. While students may score some savings with this latest marketing push, the Student Dining Board shouldn’t have to coax students into spending more time and money at their dining hall through what is basically  a Living Social deal.
The University has tried to generate more excitement over J Street in recent years by offering expanded seating space and introducing healthier food options, but these attempts have gone largely unnoticed by students. J Street may never be a popular campus hub.
But the bottom line is, handing out coupons will not make students change their minds about J Street, especially when it’s less-than-stellar and high-priced.
If the University is concerned with increasing student interest in the dining hall, it has to realize that there is no bargain grand enough to cause students to forget issues like quality of food and high prices.

Legal education is under assault.
Applications to law schools dropped nearly 14 percent this year, while jobs for graduates are increasingly harder to attain.
As many question the validity of a legal education, the GW Law School has responded by implementing a new “Inns of Court” program to break the school into smaller units, provide professional development and supplemental training and offer personalized learning and career advice specific to each student.
These are worthy initiatives. But to succeed, the Law School must tailor to students’ interests and become more engaging. I’ve talked to several of my colleagues in the Law School, and it’s safe to say the Inns of Court program has frustrated many students.
In practice, the Inns of Court’s purpose is twofold. First, it assigns students to dedicated faculty and staff mentors. And second, it is a weekly commitment for law students to attend a one-hour lecture. Lectures have included lessons about the legal job market, talks from law firm search firms and instructions on professional conduct.
Dedicated faculty and staff have clearly spent time developing programming, but there is still room for improvement. A number of changes, if implemented, would make the program more effective and beneficial to students.
As a whole, the programs have not been interactive, nor have they emphasized meeting peers or engaging in workshops. Instead, sessions are akin to lectures. Sure, students have a chance to engage with speakers, but too often, the format does not foster discussion. A preferable arrangement would be to sit at round tables and have a chance to interact with presenters and peers.
My favorite part of the program was a lecture called “How to Find Your Place in the New Legal Market,” in which the presenter did a great job of convincing attendees that employment prospects are dismal. Students would find this time better spent learning about the career aspirations of their peers while also having the chance to hear feedback from mentors.
Luckily, the template is already in place. GW Law’s personalized learning initiative acknowledges that students might actually know what they want and should receive specific education and advice.
Dean Paul Schiff Berman told me his goal was to tailor individual students’ experiences around their specific interests. His attempt to individualize education is commendable, but the Inns of Court has to be a part of that plan.
The Inns of Court sessions should be a time for students to think about their own individualized learning plans, as well as a chance for guest lecturers to provide constructive feedback during small group discussions.
Otherwise, we’re just wasting time.

“Professor” is not a dirty word.
But this election season, I’ve learned that some people think so.
Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, a first-time candidate for a Massachusetts Senate seat, is running against two-year incumbent Scott Brown, a centrist Republican. He has spent so much time lambasting Warren’s status as a non-politician that you would think she was a used car salesman.
Vicious partisan jabs are typical in politics today. But Brown’s attacks on Warren crossed the line, and they came to a head during the debate earlier this month when he said to her, “Excuse me, I’m not a student in your classroom.”
Being a professor is not something for which Warren should have to apologize. We need more professors who are able to add some intelligent conversation to our politics.
And using Warren’s intellect against her undermines the importance of education. As a student who values the people who have dedicated their careers to my education, it’s frightening and frustrating that people like Brown feel that discrediting teachers can be a successful political tactic.
Warren came from a modest background and worked her way up to get to where she is today. She grew up in a middle class family, earned a debate scholarship to GW, went to the Rutgers School of Law and became a professor.
Sounds like a respectable upbringing to me. But Brown uses Warren’s resume against her. He doesn’t seem to understand that professors don’t merely teach. For students across the country, they serve as mentors and leaders.
The GOP’s fight against intellectualism didn’t start with Brown. It has come up several times this election cycle.
Rick Santorum, a former Republican presidential candidate, joined the fray when he referred to college professors as people who are “trying to indoctrinate” their students.
Yes, I do concede that academia is stereotypically composed of left-leaning scholars. But the attack on higher education is still toxic. Our country’s leaders should be trying to foster a culture of academic achievement – not using it as a ploy to push teachers from getting involved in policymaking and political discussion.
Being a professor should be a bonus – not a deduction for someone running for office. For many Americans, a competent Washington outsider is what they have been waiting for all along.
Warren’s resume is not completely without political credentials. In 2008, she was appointed the chairperson of the Congressional Oversight Panel, and she oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was responsible for the implementation of the federal bailout after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. She was also a leader in the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, established to help Americans make responsible financial decisions in the midst of a recession.
Brown has every right to state his opposition to Warren’s economic plans and her political promises. That’s what a campaign is all about. But he cannot expect to maintain his Senate seat on Nov. 6 if he continues to suggest that Warren’s status as an intellectual makes her unqualified for public office.
Educators are the cornerstones of our society, and they’re at least as important as our politicians. It’s about time we start treating them as such.
