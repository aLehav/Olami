After the win, Fordham is now tied with GW and Dayton for third place in the A-10 after eight conference games.
Men’s basketball fell to Fordham on the road 85-70 in a hard-fought matchup against the Atlantic 10 rival, despite holding the lead for nearly 70 percent of the game.
The Colonials (11-10, 5-3 A-10) got off to a quick start, making five of their first seven attempts from the field and building a double-digit lead over the Rams (17-4, 5-3 A-10) midway through the first half. Despite the early momentum, GW could not maintain the advantage as Fordham made a massive second-half charge that rained down 52 points on the Colonials, who responded with only 33. 
Senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. got the scoring started for GW on a trip to the line where he went 1 for 2 just under two minutes into the game. Lindo anchored the Colonials’ defense throughout the game, registering his second double-double of the season with 12 points and a game-high 10 rebounds.
Graduate student guard Brendan Adams knocked down a 3-pointer about four minutes in to push the GW lead to 5, adding to the Colonials’ early game-scoring barrage.
The Colonials largely controlled the first half, knocking down shots at a .571 clip, but they struggled all game to contain the Rams persistent offensive attack. Fordham’s 85 points tied for the third-most GW has given up this season. 
The Colonials extended their lead to double digits as senior guard James Bishop found junior center Noel Brown under the basket for an easy dunk to make it 24-14 with 10 minutes to play. Bishop continued his prolific scoring season with 15 points and six assists on the night.
Fordham responded with a 6-0 run over the next two minutes to slice the lead back to 4 points, bringing the Bronx-based home crowd to its feet.
Graduate forward Khalid Moore led the run and the Rams’ offensive attack throughout the game, dropping 30 points on 10-14 shooting from the field. His consistent pressure on the GW defense tested the stamina of Adams, Bishop and redshirt freshman guard Maximus Edwards, who all shouldered more than 36 minutes of play time.
The Colonials would not allow Fordham to come within a possession of their lead for the remainder of the first half, but that did not stop Moore from capturing the momentum as he thundered home a buzzer-beater dunk off a steal to cement the score 37-33 at half.
Fordham wasted no time at the start of the second half as Moore knocked down a deep 3 within the first 10 seconds, cutting the Colonials lead to a single point.
GW responded with a pair of layups from Bishop and Lindo that put them back on top by two possessions.
Both squads continued to trade baskets, with GW’s lead never reaching more than 6 before the 10-minute mark. Fordham launched a 18-4 run over the next four minutes, featuring four forced turnovers that they managed to convert into 70 percent shooting, blowing by the Colonials and establishing a commanding 70-59 lead.
With a little under four minutes to go, Adams nailed a wing 3 to cut the Fordham lead back down to single digits at 66-74.
Shortly after, graduate guard Darius Quisenberry, who finished with 22 points, put the game on ice with a 3 of his own, extending the lead back to double digits with just under three minutes to play.
Despite Fordham’s superior overall record, they came into the matchup trailing GW in the A-10 standings after losing three conference games. After the win, they are now tied with GW and Dayton for third place after eight conference games.
The Colonials will face La Salle Wednesday as they continue their road trip at 7 p.m.

Over the past year, instances of racism and discrimination in the classroom haven’t been a question of if, but when. Like clockwork, professors target students with prejudice on the basis of their identity, leading to a wave of condemnation and outrage but rarely consequences for the professors involved. Unless officials want this familiar pattern to embed itself in the fabric of GW, they need to act – now.
In the most recent example of discriminatory behavior in the classroom, a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights earlier this month alleges assistant professor of clinical psychology Lara Sheehi created a “hostile environment” for Jewish and Israeli students in her Diversity I course, which is part of GW’s professional psychology program, last semester.
Beyond antisemitic comments and actions that allegedly included Sheehi telling a Jewish Israeli student, “It’s not your fault you were born in Israel,” Jewish students also raised concerns to Sheehi about class readings, which included references to racist treatment against Arab and Muslim people and the Israel-Palestine conflict. And one Jewish student told Sheehi that a guest speaker’s presentation on the conflict made her feel “vulnerable and unsafe” because she believed it “targeted” Israeli and Jewish people, according to the complaint. Sheehi allegedly replied by saying “in no uncertain terms, anti-Zionism is not antisemitism.”
The complaint also claims the University violated Title VI after faculty and administrators “retaliated” with “disciplinary proceedings” against students who shared concerns about Sheehi’s conduct and course.
Both the Office for Civil Rights and a “third party” are investigating these allegations, which are yet another reminder that the authority faculty wield should be used to educate students, not discriminate against them.
“The George Washington University strongly condemns antisemitism and hatred, discrimination and bias in all forms,” interim University President Mark Wrighton said in a statement after the allegations against Sheehi became public. “We remain committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment where all feel safe and free of harassment, hostility or marginalization.”
Condemning antisemitism, hatred, discrimination and bias in all its many forms is just as critical as it is easy. In fact, we’ve done so in the past after the desecration of a Torah scroll at Tau Kappa Epsilon’s on-campus fraternity house in November 2021. And let us do so again now – targeting Jewish and Israeli students for their faith or their country of origin is, as with any act of discrimination, unacceptable.
But after a year of prominent racist and ableist incidents in the classroom, that commitment to inclusivity still eludes the University. In January, GWTeach professor Alicia Bitler used the N-word in class, and assistant industry professor of decision science Marie Matta denied a student’s service dog from class. In September, professor of human rights Michael Stoil defended racist comments, including his use of the N-word during a phone call with a provost, to the students in his course. Bitler and Matta apologized for their actions without facing real consequences, while Stoil stood in defense of what he said before stepping down soon after.
There’s a difference between academic freedom and blatant discrimination. Sheehi has a right to discuss the Israel-Palestine conflict in her class, with the caveat that no professor has a right to allegedly denigrate students for their heritage. Nor can they hide behind the idea of starting a conversation or tackling a difficult topic to excuse their racist behavior – it’s just wrong.
When these incidents happen with alarming regularity, lofty rhetoric about GW being a tolerant and inclusive environment rings hollow. Whether it takes petitions and viral videos in the case of Liza Malinsky, the student whose service dog Matta barred from class, or more formal complaints to the Department of Education in this recent instance, students are looking for more immediate recourse and just outcomes than GW can provide with its slow-moving, opaque internal reporting procedures. And there are likely countless instances of bias, prejudice and microaggressions that go unreported.
Something has gone deeply wrong, and GW’s faculty has a problem. When faculty’s power over students combines with the prejudices they hold, students suffer the consequences – discrimination, harassment, emotional distress and, as in the allegations against Sheehi, retaliatory disciplinary action that can punish those who speak up about what they’re facing.
What’s so striking about this particular case is that the discrimination went beyond one professor or one classroom. The complaint states the psychology program’s faculty voted to subject the students who shared criticism of Sheehi with academic staff and a dean of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences to “disciplinary proceedings.” The program’s faculty threatened to place a “permanent negative mark” on the students’ academic records if they refused to explain “what harm they caused,” according to the complaint.
While ignorance is no excuse for bias or prejudice, it is an explanation. But faculty who knowingly and maliciously engage in discriminatory conduct directed at their students cannot and should not be part of this University. To that end, officials should work to train faculty to be cognizant of their biases and reconsider the positions of professors who fail to adhere to the values of diversity and inclusion – values GW claims are at the core of this institution.
Whether general sensitivity training or courses meant to illuminate the policies that govern GW, professors must know how to create an inclusive classroom environment for students of various backgrounds. Instead of reacting to incidents in the classroom if, or realistically when, they occur, the University can stop some of them from happening in the first place. Educating professors on appropriate classroom conduct and encouraging them to take students’ concerns seriously could begin to address the reality that GW and its classrooms simply aren’t inclusive as they ought to be.
GW did not accrue hundreds of faculty from around the world overnight, and it will take time to evaluate and ensure that the professors who interact with students on a day-to-day basis understand their concerns and respect who they are. Fostering an inclusive community requires action, not just words. The sooner the University starts, the better.

Most D.C. universities started their academic year without any mask mandates to ease back into a traditional college experience, but GW was one of the few that had a different approach. Though officials made wearing a mask optional in most indoor spaces on campus last semester, a mask mandate is still in place in instructional settings. With a post-winter break surge in COVID cases failing to materialize, GW needs to revisit its COVID-policy strategy and make masking optional in all classrooms on campus.
Despite entering the third year of the pandemic with dwindling nationwide support for measures like universal masking and social distancing, GW hasn’t updated its mask policy since September. Back then, D.C. averaged roughly 79 cases a week per 100,000 people. Positive COVID cases are low at GW and across the District, and a mandatory masking policy within classrooms is proving to be an outdated safety measure.
The University’s masking policy makes it an outlier among other schools in the city. Howard, Georgetown, Catholic and American universities have all lifted their classroom mask requirements. Georgetown removed its mask mandate in March after it reported its lowest COVID positivity rate of the semester at roughly one percent, down from 6.5 percent in January. And American stopped requiring masks in classroom settings in September 2021 after it reported a vaccination rate of approximately 98 percent.
GW’s current COVID case rate is inflated because of the smaller pool of students and faculty being tested. Because GW stopped requiring biweekly COVID testing last July, fewer people are testing, and those who do test are likely those already symptomatic of COVID. Of 516 tests that GW administered between Jan. 13 and Jan. 20, 62, or roughly 12 percent of tests, were positive. GW reported that 504, or four percent of tests, were positive out of 12,561 total tests in the same period last year. The former biweekly testing policy gave a more accurate picture of COVID positivity at GW. But with the threat of transmission waning, making masking in the classroom optional would be more conducive to the current pandemic environment.
After months of masking requirements across campus from September to January, there has been no significant jump in COVID cases, and the positivity rate continues to be lower than the data suggests. Despite not requiring masking in residence halls like the 820-person Thurston Hall or at events like basketball games and school performances, cramped, crowded spaces are more likely to be COVID hotspots than a 20-person Spanish class. But GW fails to consider this inconsistent logic.
Like American, Howard and Georgetown, GW requires its students to be fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID – Catholic University has no vaccination requirement. Approximately just one percent of the student body is exempt from GW’s requirement for religious or medical reasons, suggesting that the vast majority of students and faculty will have a built-in level of protection against COVID. Amid relatively few COVID cases and the ability to test its community should those cases rise, GW’s high vaccination levels should signal a future without masking in classrooms.
Students have been experiencing mask fatigue for months, and many of my peers haven’t worn masks in classroom settings since the beginning of the fall semester. Professors have also grown increasingly lenient with masking enforcement. Most of my instructors, regardless of the classroom size, have disregarded the mandate or outright stated that masking isn’t required in their classroom. Students and faculty already treat masking like it is optional, but the current policy ignores this truth. The University needs to recognize the inconsistent, wavering implementation of the masking requirement across GW’s campus.
The effectiveness of masking has not changed – it’s the need for masking that has. Compassion and understanding during this transitional pandemic period are still vital, and GW students and faculty are still well within their right to continue to mask themselves and politely ask anyone in close proximity to consider wearing a mask as well. COVID still poses a significant risk to immunocompromised students, and while GW should relax its masking policy within classrooms, it would be well advised to continue encouraging their use in the same vein the University promotes staying home when sick, getting flu shots and washing hands.
If positive cases were to climb or vaccines were no longer mandatory, then GW would be justified in mandating masks. Masks mandates should not disappear on campus forever. They should instead serve as intermittent tools if case rates drastically increase. COVID will not disappear in the near future, but its immediate threat has evidently dropped. In the midst of a changing pandemic culture and the embrace of a new normal, GW needs to update its masking policy to match strides with other universities in D.C. and across the country.

If you’re a regular, you may recognize Matthew Kimwon and his wife, Sophia, who both work at the store and emigrated with their two children from South Korea to the United States in 2011.
As the owner of McReynold’s Liquors, Matthew Kimwon celebrated his 10th anniversary operating the quintessential Foggy Bottom liquor store this month, where he’s racked up a long list of memorable interactions with students and other patrons throughout his career.
The family-owned business is not only the go-to liquor store for students, but it has also emerged as an integral part of the community where customers commemorate their most special moments – from popping the bubbly after Joe Biden’s presidential election win to taking photoshoots after Commencement. Kimwon’s favorite part of the job is meeting new student customers – encounters that elicit “inspiration” for the store owner because of their youthful nature as they pop into the store to pick up drinks before scrambling off to their campus get-togethers.
“They always have bright smiles, and I can get very good energy from you guys,” he said. “That’s one of the favorite things to do while operating business.”
If you’re a regular, you may recognize Kimwon and his wife, Sophia, who both work at the store and emigrated with their two children from South Korea to the United States in 2011. Kimwon, the fourth owner of the business, said he moved to the United States so his children could grow up in an environment that wasn’t as heavily competitive academically as South Korea.
Lily Speredelozzi | Assistant Photo Editor
Upon arriving in the United States, he said the language barrier made it difficult for him to find a job, so he decided to take over the business in 2013 from a member of the church he attended in Maryland who was retiring.
“To prepare for getting a job, companies take too long of a time to learn a new language and cultures, blah, blah,” Kimwon said. “But while preparing for the job market, I have to support my family too. So as soon as I land, I have to start my business.”
Since opening the store on G Street, Kimwon said he’s received memorable visits from the likes of a White House spokesperson during the administration of former President Donald Trump, a Florida governor and even a rapper who came to film a music video in the store. He said he enjoys seeing students and their parents stop at McReynold’s after GW’s commencement ceremonies so they can take pictures in front of the store.
Kimwon has sold students and D.C. residents celebratory drinks for iconic moments in their own lives and in the country as a whole. He said he remembers when Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election sent students flooding into the streets, crying in celebration and taking pictures outside the store.
“Everybody got on the street to celebrate Biden’s election, and then we sold all the bubbly drinks, champagnes, we sold out everything, first time,” he said.
But one of the most heartwarming stories to take place in McReynold’s might be an unexpected love story. Kimwon said on one especially busy night last year, two customers waiting in line struck up a conversation, which led to a budding romance. He said the couple later returned to the business to tell them they’d started dating, and the pair still regularly returns to the store together.
Lily Speredelozzi | Assistant Photo Editor
Kimwon not only remembers distinct moments with students, but he has also witnessed the evolution of students’ drink of choice over his 10 years as owner. When he first began working at the store, cheap beer like Bud Light and Budweiser held the crown for most popular.
But more recently, GW is apparently a tequila school. Kimwon said hard seltzer and tequila have taken the place of popular brews, partly powered by the rise in celebrity-owned brands like Kendall Jenner’s 818 Tequila.
“From a couple years ago, tequila business boomed a lot,” he said.
While the pandemic stifled business from tourists and office workers, Kimwon said he’s proud to have a loyal student customer base of not only GW students but students from American and Georgetown universities as well. He said the store offers a 10 percent discount on beer, wine, seltzers and other low-alcohol beverages for students to “help their wallet.”
“I have a college student as my son, but, as you know, one of the United States’ social problems is too expensive student debt, so that means you don’t have enough allowance to spend to enjoy,” he said. “And you have to study hard and work hard together, so that’s why we try to help students with providing some discount.”
At the store, Kimwon’s day-to-day operations include ordering new shipments to the store, stocking, cleaning, checking inventory and merchandising – all of which add up to more than 12 hours of work most days of the week. But he said he loves the daily job and the spot he holds in the local community.
“Having interaction with you guys is very happy for me, and I can get very good energy from youth,” he said.
Lily Speredelozzi | Assistant Photo Editor
Students have found a similar sense of welcoming within the store. Junior Caroline Dejoy, who is majoring in interior architecture, said the store offers a “bonding activity” for students who go on McReynold’s runs together. She credits McReynold’s friendly environment and smaller size to the store’s popularity among students.
“Going to Whole Foods, it’s a big store, but McReynold’s feels smaller, more intimate, and also more willing to help you,” she said.
Seniors Sidney Grimsley and Connor Christopher said they ran to McReynold’s after Biden won the 2020 election, where they found customers lined out the door and patrons drinking celebratory champagne in the store. The pair, who said they go to McReynold’s about once a month, said the store is crucial in fostering “community bonding,” whether that be through supplying alcohol for parties or providing a place to run into friends they might not have seen in a while.
“I like going there because it’s a cultural institution at GW,” Grimsley said. “The girlboss running the front counter is truly changing lives. It just has a campus community feel.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 71 percent of pregnant people aged 18 to 49 are vaccinated against COVID, and 20 percent of pregnant people received an updated booster shot.
Researchers from the Milken Institute School of Public Health found that catching COVID-19 while pregnant can increase the risk of death by seven times, according to a study released last Monday.
Emily Smith, the project’s lead author, said the study found that people infected with the coronavirus during any stage of pregnancy face a higher risk of pneumonia and neonatal morbidity by more than seven times. Smith said the research project started its meta-analysis of studies on COVID symptoms during pregnancy in early 2020 and included data from more than 13,000 subjects who tested either positive or negative for COVID from 12 different countries.
“This is by no means the first study to show that COVID in pregnancy is not good from mom to baby,” Smith said. “It is far from the first study to show that.”
Smith, an assistant professor of global health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health, said she hopes other researchers can use the study’s “summary” data as a baseline for understanding the serious health risks COVID causes during pregnancy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 71 percent of pregnant people aged 18 to 49 are vaccinated against COVID, and 20 percent of pregnant people received an updated booster shot.
She said she was “somewhat surprised” that the risk for serious health issues increased seven times among pregnant people, but clinicians already knew respiratory viruses and other infections can cause serious health issues in pregnant people like premature birth and miscarriage.
She said the World Health Organization was slower than the U.S. to make “positive recommendations” for pregnancy. The WHO released recommendations for pregnant people to get vaccinated in November of 2021, nearly a year after COVID vaccines were available to the public.
Smith said identifying COVID risks in pregnancy is difficult through research because of the high number of subjects with COVID who are needed, and the same is true for comparing pregnant and nonpregnant people to study pregnancy complications.
“This is somewhat unique from the existing COVID literature because we have data from all over the world,” Smith said. “Especially pregnant women in Asia and Africa have been underrepresented in the published literature so far.”
Kate Grusich, a spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the CDC recommends vaccination and boosters against COVID for people who are pregnant and people who are breastfeeding. She said pregnant people who catch COVID have a higher risk of severe illnesses that can lead to hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, ventilation and cardiac and respiratory life support.
“Evidence continues to show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective and beneficial to both the pregnant person and the baby,” Grusich said in an email.
She said the benefits of COVID vaccination during pregnancy “outweigh” the risks of infection from COVID. Grusich said there is “no evidence” to suggest COVID vaccines are harmful to people who are breastfeeding or to their babies, and COVID vaccines are not associated with fertility problems in women or men.
“COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk of delivering a preterm or stillborn infant,” Grusich said. “Perinatal transmission from the pregnant person to their infant has been reported, but it is rare.”
Experts in infectious disease and epidemiology said the study reinforces existing research that found pregnant people encounter greater health risks from catching the coronavirus than receiving COVID vaccines.
Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said vaccine hesitancy among pregnant people is increasingly common because of similar perceptions of distrust among the general public. He said research that found pregnant people have a higher risk of death from COVID caused pregnant people to be classified as a risk group for severe COVID.
He said pregnant people have a higher risk of complications due to COVID, but health care providers can counsel patients about vaccination to protect pregnant people and their infants from COVID. Adalja said the danger of disinformation is a major challenge to the willingness of vaccine reception in pregnant people.
“That data research that makes it into the mainstream media may influence the willingness to get a vaccine,” Adalja said.
David Savitz, a professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health, said the study reinforces that the risks from catching COVID in pregnant people are more serious than the “absence of adverse effects” from the COVID vaccines. He said monitoring for potential adverse effects of the vaccines in pregnant people can help researchers detect problems before they occur.
He said vaccine trials excluded pregnant people in the past, but health care providers now have enough information about vaccine safety to know pregnant people are safe to receive vaccines. Savitz said studies that “documented” vaccine effects in pregnant people will always be needed to monitor potential problems in pregnancy and vaccination.
Misinformation about the risk of receiving a COVID vaccine during or before pregnancy created false theories that they cause infertility and are unsafe for pregnant people who are breastfeeding.
“So I think that’s really the message to reinforce there is that this is all about what happens if you don’t get vaccinated, the risk that you may be facing,” Savitz said.

The panelists talked about issues like how U.S. nuclear war plans are developed and maintained and U.S. command and control systems’ vulnerability to attack.
Authors of “Managing U.S. Nuclear Operations in the 21st Century,” an analysis of the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal and management, gathered to discuss selected chapters from the book Wednesday.
The panelists and authors of the book, Elaine Bunn, John Harvey and Claude Robert Kehler, discussed how U.S. nuclear war plans are developed and maintained as well as U.S. command and control systems’ vulnerability to attack. The GW Institute for Security and Conflict Studies, the Elliott School of International Affairs Book Launch Series and the Security Policy Studies program organized the event, which was moderated by a co-editor of the book, Charles Glaser and held at the Elliott School.
Alyssa Ayres, the dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs, said the goal of the book aligns with the Elliott School’s mission of educating the next generation, conducting research and engaging the public and policy community.
“This book represents a remarkable, multiyear and collaborative effort to bring civilian and military leaders together to map out a framework for U.S. nuclear strategy since the end of the Cold War,” Ayres said.
Kehler, the former commander of the United States Strategic Command who now serves as a senior fellow at National Defense University, said he focused on the human dimension of U.S. nuclear operations in his chapter of the book. He read aloud portions of the chapter, emphasizing the importance of having a structured personnel system devoted to managing and operating the country’s nuclear assets.
“Although policy plans and hardware typically dominate the conversation, men and women who operate our nuclear forces and maintain, secure and support the nuclear mission form the most important component of the U.S. nuclear deterrent,” Kehler said, quoting from his chapter in the book.
Harvey, a physicist with more than 40 years of experience working on nuclear weapons, previously served as the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs in the Department of Defense.
Harvey spoke about the technical side of the U.S.’s nuclear command and control program, known as NC2, namely updating the country’s satellite detection system. He wrote that while the foreign policy landscape changes, technological improvements occur and diplomatic relations develop, the country’s command and control program must transform as well.
He listed issues with modernization that might complicate the current program and offered several solutions to adapt it, like securing the system’s aging cyber-based components against possible hacking attempts.
“Today’s NC2 system is a legacy of the Cold War,” Harvey said. “It is fundamentally the same system that we had in place in the 1970s.”
Bunn, a consultant on strategic issues and a nonresident senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Project on Nuclear Issues, said it is important for the country to focus on the diplomatic side of nuclear operations.
“Understanding nuclear operations in U.S. alliances is about a whole lot more than just the weapons or what you think of as military operational details,” Bunn said.
The panel then took questions from the audience, each speaking from their areas of specialization.
“One thing you see from this panel, and you see it through the book, is just the depth of expertise and experience that comes through and the kind of nuances you don’t get from newcomers,” Glaser said.
