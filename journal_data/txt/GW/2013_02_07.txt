Students should be able go to sleep each night assured that their residence halls are secure.
But in the past two weeks, there have been a number of burglaries where at least 10 electronics were stolen in three residence halls. And although each building requires students to tap their GWorlds to enter, not every residence hall has the same level of University Police Department surveillance daily. In fact, some do not even have guards or officers to monitor the doors at night, let alone during the day.
It is impossible to anticipate or prevent every crime, but it is likely that some of these burglaries could have been prevented if employees manned the front desks of these buildings. Security surely serves as a deterrence for criminals.
Thurston Hall consistently has desk attendants who monitor the lobby and entry. But others, like Munson Hall and The West End, which are on the same street as the Foggy Bottom Metro and just as vulnerable to unwanted visitors, rarely have any employees stationed in the lobby.
UPD Chief Kevin Hay said students must be vigilant and ensure that when they tap into their buildings with a GWorld, there are no individuals following them inside without also tapping their IDs. Crime is a community problem, and students play a critical role in ensuring their personal property is safe. Students should always lock their doors during the day and night to prevent theft or burglaries.
But it is not the responsibility of a student to prevent unauthorized individuals from entering the building.
Individuals who lack access to a residence hall can easily wait for a student to open the door so they can slip inside.
In September 2011, a man followed a female student into City Hall and attempted to sexually assault her. One month later, UPD arrested a man who trailed into The West End behind students. He entered rooms and allegedly punched students.
Students pay between $7,150 and $13,400 to live in campus residence halls – in many cases, paying more than it would cost to live in an off-campus apartment with a doorman. They should at least be secure.
To make security more of a priority, the University is requesting money in the budget from the Board of Trustees Friday that would provide funding for electronic locks that would function with GWorlds, similar to hotel key cards. This is a laudable request. But the University should also place at least one employee – be it a security guard or desk attendant – in each residence hall lobby to monitor the building at all times.
Having a staff member in some residence halls only during the night hours is not enough: Burglaries can and do happen at all times of the day. But they are less likely to happen if there is some form of security in buildings.
Some residence halls will naturally need heightened security due to their size or location on campus. But no residence hall should be left completely unprotected beyond an initial door tap.
Temple, Howard and Northeastern universities – all schools that maintain a 24-hour security presence in all of their residence halls – see significantly fewer burglaries than GW.
Students’ safety should be a top priority, especially with GW in the heart of a city. UPD has been successful in curtailing burglaries in recent years, down from more than 100 cases in 2009 to 39 in 2011.
But until that number is reduced to zero, there is still work that must be done.

At least two students have been scammed by a GWork job posting that offered students large rewards in exchange for access to their bank accounts.
The pair of students reported “suspicious communication” from the employer, Adele Harpole Horsemanship, after replying to its posting about “barn help” on GWork. The posting was taken down four days after it was posted last month.
Career Center communications director Jeff Dagley said the employer promised applicants large payments “in exchange for allowing the use of the applicant’s bank account” to deposit checks or transfer money. He called it “more sophisticated” than some scams that have tricked students in the past by charging application fees.
“After a student later contacted us for guidance claiming that the information requested by the employer did not match that which was listed in the posted description, our staff immediately responded to the student that we would investigate the situation and then immediately suspended the posting, removing it from view,” Dagley said.
The posting was originally approved by Career Center staff, Dagley said. He said when employers ask to post on GWork, staff briefly review the posting and look for “red flags” like wages that appear inappropriately high for the level of work.
The Career Center uncovers about five scams a year out of the 15,000 positions posted on GWork, Dadley said.
The Career Center also offers students several tips for how to spot a fraudulent posting, including improper use of English.
“Scams such as this one are not restricted to University job postings. They appear in all types of online posting systems,” Dagley said. “The way to mitigate the situation is to have in place a stringent review process and a strong effort to educate the users of the online system.”

With two seconds left to play, sophomore guard Chakecia Miller drained a layup off an assist from senior forward Shi-Heria Shipp, solidifying the Colonials’ three-point win over the Richmond Spiders.
The last 24 seconds of the game consisted of aggressive defense between Miller and Shipp that pushed GW to victory. After leaping to gather her fourth rebound of the game, Shipp passed the ball down to Miller, who forced her way into the paint in order to give GW a one-point lead. Soon after, Miller stole the ball to drive home the final tally.
Thanks in part to the team’s aggressive play until the final seconds, GW walked away with a 57-54 victory over Richmond.
“When we went into the locker room [at halftime], [head] coach [Jonathan Tsipis] said that we have to find a way sometimes,” Miller said. “And I think we did that.”
GW (10-12, 4-4) started the game with strong transition play and an equally formidable offensive effort. But both teams played an aggressive man-to-man defense, which ultimately led to 11 lead changes.
Within the first four minutes, the Colonials attacked the Spiders with a half-court press that included traps whenever possible. A Miller dish to freshman Alexis Chandler, who ended the game with five points, made the score 14-11 with 11 minutes remaining in the half.
Richmond replied with a half-court press during the Colonials’ next offensive possession but GW was able to maintain their composure.
“With the timeouts we just had to re-group, calm down and just think about what we were doing down there,” Miller said. “We just can’t get too amped up during the game because your adrenaline is running.”
At the end of the first half, the Colonials were up by five points, 32-27, due to senior forward Megan Nipe’s closing three-pointer.
Richmond, however, entered the second half with a renewed intensity and went on an 8-0 run until Nipe broke the Spiders’ momentum with a quick jumper.
“I think [Richmond head] coach [Michael] Shafer had his team ready coming out of the locker room to start the second half with just a higher intensity than we had,” Tsipis said. “We kind of went back and forth.”
Graduate student forward Tara Booker helped the Colonials slowly come back from a six-point deficit with two made free throws and a quick jumper off of fellow graduate student forward Sara Mostafa’s offensive rebound.
Booker ended the game with six points and 10 rebounds, while Mostafa contributed four points and four rebounds.
“I think the thing I’m most proud of is the way the team battled. We had to get the rebounds off of the missed free throws. We had to push the ball up the floor,” Tsipis said.
As both teams battled back and forth, the Colonials were one point from tying the game with 52 seconds left. After missed free throws from the Spiders, GW capitalized on the additional opportunities to execute plays.
The final series of plays between Miller and Shipp were not drawn up by Tsipis, but ultimately led the team to an exciting victory. It was an example of his team “finding a way to win,” and the head coach was quick to note that, overall, the win was a teamwide effort. Nipe contributed a total of 12 points while senior Danni Jackson added six.
“You don’t get style points in basketball,” Tsipis said. “You get wins and losses.”

Students will soon use GWorlds to unlock their residence hall rooms, with several buildings ditching keys as early as this summer to curtail theft.
The electronic locks will be added over the next three years but the University will request funds in next year’s budget for installations in buildings including Ivory Tower this summer. Next year’s budget, which lays out funds for all campus renovations, goes before the Board of Trustees in May.
“We believe that these locks provide a convenience to building residents, assist in keeping doors locked when rooms are uninhabited, and assist the University in managing its key inventory,” University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard wrote in an email.
Students would tap their GWorld cards onto their door handles to get into their rooms, which would lock automatically.
University Police Chief Kevin Hay’s announcement of the plans for electronic locks comes after a string of burglaries over the past two weeks in Ivory Tower, Fulbright and JBKO. At least 10 electronics
, including laptops and iPads, were stolen from unlocked rooms.
Lafayette Hall was equipped with the locks as part of a $9.8 million renovation in 2011, and Munson Hall added the locks after a $2.8 million renovation last year. The University’s capital and operating budget does not provide a breakdown of specific costs. Sherrard said “it’s difficult to provide a specific cost” because of varying prices of locks in each building.
Hay said the locks in Lafayette and Munson halls have helped decrease thefts in both buildings.
The only other building on campus with automated locks is City Hall, which is a former hotel and uses a separate key card system.
The locks will also be added to the $130 million “superdorm” set to replace the Crawford Hall, The Schenley and The West End. Crews will begin construction on the hall this summer.
The University of Virginia and Villanova University use the same technology made by Schlage, according to the manufacturer’s website.
After the crime streak in the past month, UPD put up posters on residence halls, telling students not to allow others to follow them into buildings without a GWorld and to remember to lock their doors.
“Most thefts occur in rooms that have been left unlocked and forced entry into residence hall rooms is rare,” Hay said. “Whether it’s a traditional manual door lock or a newer electronic lock, thefts and burglaries decline considerably when individual room locks are engaged.”

GW got exactly what it needed out of Wednesday’s game against Duquesne: a bounce-back win.
And unlike many of the team’s games this season, there was no last second possession or chance at a buzzer beater that would decide the game. This one was decided from the very start, as GW coasted to hand the Dukes their tenth straight loss, 79-57. It was a dominant victory that sets up arguably the team’s biggest home game in over a decade when Butler heads to the Smith Center Saturday.
Finding the offensive rhythm they have been searching for all season, the Colonials got out to a hot start in the first half.  Guards were open along the perimeter to knock down threes, lanes were open for the drive or drop off, and the floor was spread out to run and get in transition.
“We got off to a real good start offensively,” head coach Mike Lonergan said. “We shot 54 percent in the first half, but for the first five minutes we probably shot 80 percent.”
It wasn’t quite 80 percent, but the Colonials did go 5-for-11 from behind the arc in the first half, led by 3-of-4 shooting from senior guard Lasan Kromah. For the game, GW shot 50.8 percent from the field, making use of the offensive flow created by the team’s 20 assists.
The strong bench play from Kromah helped spark the team’s offense and seemed to be contagious to the other Colonials waiting on the sideline. GW’s bench outscored the Dukes’ 28-8 in the first half, and went on to extend that margin to 40-18 by game’s end.
“I think we tired them out with our bench,” Lonergan said. “We played a lot of guys and got a lot of production.”
Perhaps GW’s strongest
performance of the night, though, came from in the paint. Having started four different centers this year, Duquesne has struggled to find a consistent inside presence, and the Colonials took advantage of that hole.
Using both senior forward Isaiah Armwood and freshman Kevin Larsen, the Colonials completely controlled the inside on both ends of the court. For the game, GW outscored the Dukes 44-14 in the paint, outrebounded them 47-27, and led 14-6 on second chance point opportunities.
“So that was definitely our game plan, to get the ball inside,” Lonergan said.  “And then to take the threes away from them because they’re guard oriented.”
Armwood would go on to post a double-double for the Colonials, scoring 14 points and adding 13 boards to the stat sheet. GW didn’t need any dramatic shots from the senior forward, but his sixth double-double of the season was a valuable contribution to the stat sheet.
Down 10 points at the half, Duquesne needed to make some adjustments, and it did – switching out of its man-to-man defense in favor of a 2-3 zone. For the time being, GW’s offense was stalled, unable to get inside and doing nothing more than swinging the ball along the perimeter.
As Lonergan said though, the Colonials’ consistent production off the bench and hard defense on the opposite end ultimately left the Dukes winded, and that spilled over to their defense as well.
Soon, GW’s 10 point halftime lead was up to 20, and soon, GW was on its way to a smooth road win – its third straight when away from the Smith Center.
Leading the way for the Colonials was the hot-shooting Kromah, who had a game high 19 points while grabbing six boards. Kromah took advantage of the help-side-oriented Dukes defense and hit the open shots when he had them. Despite spending tonight, and much of the season, coming off the bench, Kromah has begun to embrace his role as a sixth man.
“The main goal for the team is just to win games no matter who starts,” Kromah said.  “You know it’s about who finishes the game.  And I come in and try to produce as much as possible to help my team win.”
If there had to be one criticism of GW’s performance it would be their free throw shooting.  The team took a step back at the line tonight, going 8-for-18 from the charity stripe – much like it did in contests earlier in the season.
Still, the bounce-back win signifies something important for the Colonials: They’re getting tougher. Even more, it gives the team valuable momentum coming of a loss to La Salle and heading into Saturday’s contest against No. 14 Butler.

April 11 | 9:30 Club | $25
Resurging from a two-year absence, Cold War Kids have again made their mark on alternative rock. This California-based ensemble defies the limitations of the indie genre, producing the kind of animated, lively singles with subtly visceral lyrics that bands like Foster the People now champion. Sprightly and rhythmic, their latest single, “Miracle Mile,” suggests the band is delving into the genre’s penchant for fun and uplifting musicality. An energetic, revitalizing tone flourishes after a constrained intro riff, mirroring the band’s burst from a mini hiatus. Cold War Kids’ 9:30 Club appearance will arrive right as their next album, “Dear Miss Lonelyhearts” does, promising a varied set of standard, older hits for longtime fans and fresh tracks for those newbies flocking to their whimsical formula for rock.
Score: Seldom does a band return from a musical hiatus with such energy, bravado and, frankly, success. Even more promising, the refreshing tonality of “Miracle Mile” might just set the sound for the rest of their new album.
Bore: While Cold War Kids have consistently delivered a uniquely magnetic sound, to some, they may just sound like run-of-the-mill indie rockers.

For someone confined to the singer-songwriter title, Rufus Wainwright possesses musical dexterity rarely found in contemporary artists. With a self-authored classical opera under his belt, Wainwright’s music ranges from haunting, orchestral piano pieces – his stunning, droning “Hallelujah” cover – to bouncier, energetic pop-friendly tunes. Yet despite his atypical approach to modern pop, Wainwright’s lyrical themes remain as accessible as ever. His meditations on everything from discordant relationships to political culture prove inclusive, as anyone who’s endured unrequited love or social disillusionment can find solace in Wainwright’s tales.
Score: In a live setting, Wainwright’s inclusion of strings, horns and organs is sure to amaze.
Bore: The operatic musical theatrics of this set might be off-putting to those with an aversion to the histrionic.

“I speak out for the kids who don’t have shit,” Richard Colson Baker, also known as Machine Gun Kelly, muses in his “See My Tears” music video. To be certain, Machine Gun Kelly can empathize with his audience. His adolescence, punctuated by drug addiction, depression and a fragmented family, now serves as the impetus for his entire music-making process. Machine Gun Kelly chronicles the tribulations of society’s misfits, and his spit-fire verses are all delivered with the unbridled confidence and ballsy pomposity of someone who adopted the name of a notorious 1920’s gangster as his stage moniker.
Score: With his huge net of support from the rap community, from Waka Flocka to Diddy, you never know who might make a surprise appearance at his show.
Bore: MGK’s most famed hit, “Wild Boy,” exemplifies the artist’s most juvenile tendencies: Its boasting is unwarranted, and its repetitive “Yeah, bitch, yeah bitch/Call me Steve-O” hook is lyricism at its dumbest.

When members of the GW Secular Society hung posters around campus with pictures of members captioned “This is what an Atheist looks like,” they hoped they would be making campus more comfortable for atheists who wanted to tell their families about their beliefs.
But most of the signs have been torn down.
“People thought we were trying to recruit or to preach, but we were trying to show people we’re just like everyone else and we’re not the devil,” junior Nare Gukasyan, a member of the GW Secular Society, said.
Gukasyan said she comes from a fairly liberal area of Massachusetts and identified as agnostic throughout high school. But when she came to GW, she began to identify as an atheist.
She said she often gets challenged on her views and is forced her to defend her beliefs.
“Well, at school when you tell someone you’re in a secular society the first word that comes out of their mouths is ‘Why?’ But when you tell someone you’re Jewish or Muslim, they don’t ask why like that,” Gukasyan said.
Gukasyan was surprised by the response to the posters, and said she had not expected such a hostile reaction on a campus that is often noted for being liberal.
“I think I expected the school to be much more open. I don’t know if ‘liberal’ is the word, but open to different understandings or different beliefs, and recognize that just because some people don’t believe in certain things doesn’t mean you’re weird. You’re just different,” Gukasyan said.
The group was started and later disbanded several years ago due to lack of student interest. Now, it boasts more than 100 members.
Sophomore Magdalena Stuehrmann, the group’s public relations and outreach director, said members became concerned after an online fight prompted by comments on the Overheard at GW Facebook page broke out. Stuehrmann said the weekly support group meetings for atheists and agnostics are designed to help students feel safe on campus and quell any negative feelings.
“We were shocked to see the lack of acceptance, especially on such a liberal campus,” Stuehrmann said.
Though the group tends to comprise mostly atheists or agnostics, Stuehrmann said there are also members who identify with other religions, including Christianity and Buddhism. She described the organization as “a group of people who share the belief in the separation of church and state.”
“We have several members who haven’t told their parents about their beliefs yet due to the fear of repercussions,” Stuehrmann said.
The Secular Society is currently planning to hold events this spring, including a Darwin Day Celebration, to discuss human evolution. They will also host an event featuring speaker Nate Phelps, an atheist and son of the founder of the Westboro Baptist Church.

Dozens of student performers are pressing GW for more low-cost, late-night practice areas, saying they are sometimes forced to rehearse outside or in parking garages and common rooms.
The groups say they should be allowed to practice after business hours in areas like the Marvin Center ballrooms, suited for dance, and that space in Old Main and townhouses such as Building XX and Building J should open up.
GW Ballroom is leading the lobbying effort, trying to link up the campus’ 80 performance groups, after the organization nearly lost its practice spot this year. Nicole Martin, logistics coordinator for the group, said the University asked for $6,000 a semester for GW Ballroom’s usual room in Lerner Health and Wellness Center, which it previously used for free. GW Ballroom received $8,000 in funding from the Student Association’s Finance Committee this year and also uses the funds to travel to other states for performances.
“We just don’t have that in our budget, maybe if we had been told earlier in the year, we could have tried to work something out, but by now it’s too late,” Martin said.
The group ultimately bargained out of paying for this semester, but Martin said she is concerned about future reservations.
Christopher Kim, president of Capital Funk, said finding space has always been hard, and this year he has resorted to taking his group to locations like parking garages and Kogan Plaza when other locations are not available. He said his group has to schedule audition space in the Marvin Center’s Grand Ballroom 11 months in advance.
To avoid scheduling issues, Kim has also moved his group to the Mount Vernon Campus, where he said they have an easier time reserving the Lloyd Gym or Hand Chapel.
While GW’s more than 400 groups across campus face a space crunch when trying to book rooms, performing groups are more limited in their options. Hard wood floor ballrooms are often booked a year in advance.
About 7,000 student group events have taken place in GW’s non-academic spaces, mainly in the Marvin Center, since school started in August, Assistant Vice President for Events and Venues Michael Peller said. Last year, the Marvin Center hosted 6,600 student events.
Peller said the problem stems from a cramped urban campus and the competing uses of Marvin Center ballrooms as both dance space and space for other events.
“There is no dedicated dance space. It’s competing with all the other needs,” Peller said. “We certainly would love to have more space, but that’s something we have to deal with and try to balance. We can’t give space to everyone all the time. That’s the challenge.”
Eishita Nariani, president of GW Bhangra, once booked space in the Marvin Center for the weekend only to later get a call asking to give it up so the school could prep an event for Monday.
“It’s always something where we need to work with them and not where they really reciprocate or try to negotiate with us,” Nariani said.
Peller said the University has a hard time planning to invest in developing spaces with one sole use because space is limited and interest in niche groups like dance organizations can vary from year to year. He said constructing meeting and conference space in the Marvin Center’s third floor terrace would be a safer bet because of its multipurpose use.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said she could not say which spaces are already reserved for the next year because the booking system only shows spots by day.
“Our system does not allow us to provide an overall snapshot of our future availability and only allows us to see the availability on a daily basis,” Sherrard said.
Martin, the GW Ballroom coordinator, enlisted SA President Ashwin Narla to tack on performing practice space to the SA’s campaign for student space. The SA held a rally in Kogan Plaza last week, which drew more than a thousand students. Narla said the SA collected 4,000 signatures as of 8 p.m. Tuesday when the petition closed,  falling short of its goal of 5,000 signatures.
Narla will meet with Provost Steven Lerman this week to talk about opening up the performing spaces that close after business hours, which is when student groups typically practice.
In the past, administrators said it is hard to keep academic halls open past business hours because the University Police Department would need extra staffing. Narla pushed for the University to keep academic spaces like Duques and Funger halls open for 24 hours, and administrators agreed to 2 a.m.
“We continually evaluate the use of student space across campus and are monitoring closely the use of Duques and Funger halls,” Sherrard said. “We encourage students to use spaces in the Marvin Center, Gelman Library, Duques Hall and Funger Hall, among other spaces.”
Narla said opening up the academic space that can be used by dance and theater students, as well as other spaces with hardwood floors, past business hours is the best solution because it has dance studios that go unused past 5 p.m.
“We’re going to do our best. That’s the type of stuff we can look into,” Narla said. “If that’s not an option, we’ll explore other options, one of which would be the ‘superdorm.’ ”
Narla added that the “superdorm” basement would be better served as meeting and study room because performing space is “not in exactly high volume use throughout the day.”
But the SA has lobbied for nearly two years to increase student space while making few gains, and Martin said she is worried performance groups might be tossed aside.
“We’re not really sure what’s going to happen. We just hope to get included in the initiative,” Martin said.
Saumita Rajeevan, president of GW Raas, said her team practices Mondays through Fridays but has limited practice venues because the Marvin Center only allows groups to book large spaces three times in a month. When they can’t get the space in the Continental or Grand ballrooms, Rajeevan said they usually resort to an Ivory Tower common room.
“It’s really hard because at the end of January to March we have competitions every two weeks, and it’s really competitive and the other schools aren’t having these problems,” Rajeevan said.
