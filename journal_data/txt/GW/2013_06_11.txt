GW will crack down on loud off-campus parties this fall with quicker disciplinary action for students and a new online complaint system for neighbors, University officials announced at a meeting with Foggy Bottom residents Wednesday.
The changes were some of the most dramatic steps the University has taken to calm its relationship with Foggy Bottom neighbors, who for years have called on GW to tighten its rules for students living off campus, particularly members of Greek life who are living in off-campus townhouses not registered with the University.
The University now will collect addresses for all Greek life members living off campus, create an online complaint form for neighbors and take disciplinary action against students after a second verified report of disruptive behavior instead of a third. GW could also consider video footage from neighbors as verification that misbehavior occurred.
“We’re going to take a more proactive and aggressive role with fraternities and sororities, but we want to engage them in the conversation,” Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski said. “This is a series of attempts to address behavior in some different ways. It won’t be perfect and I’ll assure you we’ll probably make some mistakes along the way.”
Neighbors have long criticized students’ off-campus behavior in email listservs and community meetings, recounting stories about students throwing beer bottles at them and playing loud music in the middle of the night.
Students could also see fines for neighborhood misconduct, like failing to pick up trash during move-out, though Konwerski said that plan will be in a pilot phase. “If students and the community members were interested in [other] types of fines, as a way to diminish certain behaviors, we certainly would consider them and try to test them out,” Konwerski added in an email.
Students will also need to take part in a mandatory online orientation in August that lays out issues of underage drinking and objectionable noise.
If students do not attend meetings with staff outlining the changes this fall, they will face a course registration hold. The Greek life office will meet with fraternity and sorority members living off campus on Aug. 21 and 25. Other student organizations will begin reporting member addresses next spring and meet with advisers about the changes this fall.
“Really our goal is to discuss what we expect and what the community expects, and kind of how we can live in peace,” Konwerski said.
The University officials said they will also consider increasing the amount of time staff members monitor the neighborhood on weekend nights. University Police officers had been the ones knocking on townhouse doors during noise complaints until this spring when it changed its off-campus response protocol that violates D.C. law.
GW will try to change that law, officials announced Wednesday, by backing a potential D.C. Council bill that would allow campus police officers to break up parties in off-campus residences.

Konwerski was joined at the meeting by some of GW’s top officials from the offices of general counsel, Greek life, and safety and security. He said in an email after the meeting that he would begin deeper discussions with Student Association leaders this week on how to put the policies into effect.
The moves come after the University announced it would mandate that students live on-campus through their junior year, beginning with the Class of 2018. That step was also listed as a way to appease neighbors, but has faced strong opposition from students for cutting down on cheaper living options.
The crackdown also follows Georgetown University, which reached an extensive agreement with neighbors last year during its campus plan negotiations that quieted complaints about student partying off campus.
At the meeting, Foggy Bottom, neighbors complained that GW is not doing enough to “play hardball” with students misbehaving off campus. Complaints mostly surrounded townhouses rented by students in the western part of the neighborhood – between 24th and 26th streets and down I Street and New Hampshire Avenue.
“I’ve invested all my savings in my home here, and I won’t let that go away because some kid wants to have a kegger,” said Daniel Gage, a Foggy Bottom resident, who described repeated problems with student partying near his house.
Some of the dozen Foggy Bottom residents at the meeting said they were pleased with the changes, and resident Marina Streznewski said she was even surprised GW moved with a comprehensive strategy so quickly.
“They know we’re angry,” she said after the meeting. “We’re civil, but we won’t be nice.”

Zach Gorelick was about four months old when doctors treated him for a birth defect called clubfoot. After the treatment, which was “extremely expensive,” the alumnus was able to live a normal life, though he said gym class was always a bit tougher.
In developing countries, children born with clubfoot – a condition that causes feet to grow inward and downward – may never be able to run, play or go to school because of the steep costs and distant medical facilities.
Gorelick, a 2013 graduate of the School of Media and Public Affairs, is planning to bring light to the issue, which is largely unknown in the Western world, by creating a documentary of how it affects people in the U.S., Vietnam, Ghana and New Zealand.
“I want people to know what this issue is because I want people to know and care. But to care you have to know,” he said. “If it’s treated, it can literally change somebody’s life. To treat it is not actually that difficult given our resources in the Western world.”
Gorelick said he will share his own experience with the condition to show how few people in the U.S. are aware of it. He said he raising awareness will also help raise funds for the treatment process in countries where it is more challenging.
He will travel with his film partner, Hannah Silverstein, who graduated from Georgetown University and witnessed the effects of untreated clubfoot while studying abroad in Ghana. Gorelick, who graduated with a degree in journalism, was also the editor-in-chief of an online news site, The GW Patriot.
Silverstein said she was inspired to create a documentary because of how difficult it was for her to find information about clubfoot that was easy to understand, even with a background in public health. After the two graduated in May, they decided it was the best time to actually make the film.
“This is the only time in our life that we don’t have house payments, car payments, bills to pay. It’s the time to go out there and have this adventure,” she said.
One in about every 750 children worldwide are born with clubfoot, and Gorelick said getting treatment in developing countries can require eight to nine hours of travel a few times a week, which is impossible for many families.
Looking to raise about $45,000 to pay for the trip and production, the team has started a online fundraising campaign. So far, they’ve raised about $3,000 with the help of 40 supporters.
Gorelick and Silverstein plan to head abroad in October or November. He said they choose each country for a reason. In Vietnam, there is a large network of medical facilities specifically for treating clubfoot scattered around the country.
And New Zealand, which Gorelick said is often the most surprising to people, boasts state-of-the-art hospitals to treat clubfoot all over the island because Polynesians have a higher risk of being born with clubfoot.
Ghana, a much poorer nation, will offer a stark contrast to the other countries’ treatment. The Ponseti method, the most common type of treatment there, is not just a one-time surgery, but a series of adjustments and casts that require several trips to a doctor.
“For a rural village that’s eight to nine hours away from the clinic, going in one to two times a week is a sustained effort that’s very difficult for a rural environment,” he said.
Gorelick said he hopes to use the documentary to spread awareness of his condition, as he said it never fails to surprise him how few people know what he is talking about when he mentions clubfoot. The two plan to hold viewings of the film, and share it with clubfoot organizations that have reached out to them to get word out.
He hopes that by spreading awareness, it may help ease treatment in places it is more difficult to treat.
“If it’s treated, it can literally change somebody’s life. But to treat it it’s not actually that difficult given our resources in the western world,” he said.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the procedure to correct clubfoot cost Gorelick $200. In fact, he said it cost more than that. The Hatchet also incorrectly referred to clubfoot as a disease, instead of a condition. We regret these errors.

The University will cancel its study abroad programs in Egypt this fall as violent protests continue to rock the country.
Eight undergraduate students and three graduate students had planned to study in Egypt in the fall, but University officials called the situation unsafe.
“Our foremost concern is to preserve the safety and security of GW students, faculty and staff, wherever they are carrying out their work,” Donna Scarboro, associate provost for international programs, said in a release Monday. “We don’t want students to be anxious about safety as they go about their normal activities, nor do we want their studies to be disrupted.”
One of GW’s top Middle East scholars Marc Lynch said last week that the University needed to pull students out of the country for their safety.
“I am a big believer in the value of studying abroad, but I don’t believe it is currently safe for American students in Egypt,” said Lynch, the director of GW’s Institute for Middle East Studies.
GW pulled out seven students from summer programs earlier this month after protestors overthrew former president Mohamed Morsi and the military brought an interim president to power. The  State Department issued an evacuation order for Americans on July 4, shortly after a student from Kenyon College was stabbed and killed during a protest.
Clashes between the military and the exiting leadership, the Muslim Brotherhood, have resulted in at least 50 deaths.
At least one student planned to remain in Egypt after GW suspended its programs. But Scarboro said the University discouraged students from traveling to Egypt alone.
“If a student decided to go to Egypt on their own, they would be going as an individual, not as a student of the University,” she said.
The University of California system and University of Michigan also suspended study abroad programs in response to the protests.

Students will be required to live on campus through their junior year, starting with freshmen who enter GW in fall 2014.
The requirement is intended to “further support students’ academic and campus experiences,” according to a University release Monday. Students can currently move off campus at the end of their sophomore year. In 2011, University officials had floated the option as a way to raise $2.6 million to support academic and research efforts, but never followed through with the move.
The announcement comes just as the University begins construction on a $130 million residence hall, slated to open in 2016, that will add 300 beds to campus. It will house nearly 900 sophomores and juniors.
About 40 percent of students live off campus after their sophomore year, according to the release.
The mandate will also appease local residents, who have repeatedly criticized students living off-campus as disruptive to the neighborhood.
“By requiring that students live six semesters on campus, we’re taking another important step to minimize impacts of students living in the surrounding neighborhoods,” Britany Waddell, director of community relations, said in the release.
The change out of the mainstream among other urban universities, which can sometimes have a difficult time finding enough space on campus to house students.
Georgetown University, which has a historically discordant relationship with neighbors, requires all freshmen and sophomores to live on campus, as well as junior transfer students.
Boston University requires only freshmen to live on campus, and American University and University of Southern California allows all students to live off campus. In downtown Boston, Suffolk University students are only guaranteed one year of on-campus, and students in the Honors Program are guaranteed two years.

The man who was caught with a suitcase full of electronics in Ivory Tower earlier this year pleaded guilty to 10 offenses Wednesday including burglary, theft and unlawful entry.
James Dunmore admitted to a federal court that he stole five laptops, a Nintendo Wii game, two cell phones and a GWorld card, University Police Chief Kevin Hay said.
The court will sentence Dunmore on Sept. 13 for three counts of burglary, six counts of theft and one count of unlawful entry.
UPD officers arrested Dunmore Jan. 28 after he broke into rooms, mostly on the sixth floor, and attempted to carry items out in a stolen suitcase. Officers received a tip from a student and stopped the man as he tried to flee campus.
Dunmore had trailed into Ivory Tower behind a student. He then walked along the hallways, trying doorhandles until he found ones that were unlocked, Hay said.
That string of thefts brought GW’s security, which is relatively light compared to other city schools, under scrutiny. Top security officials said the security procedures were sufficient to stop crime when students are vigilant in preventing “tailgating” into their buildings.

University President Steven Knapp greets students in person, but rarely interacts with them online.
Correction appended
University President Steven Knapp earned $1.108 million last fiscal year – the third-straight year his total compensation surpassed the million-dollar marker.
Knapp’s compensation – which includes bonuses and his on-campus residence, the F Street House – keeps him among the top few-dozen highest paid university presidents.
His $761,496 salary, which does not include benefits, increased by 5 percent that fiscal year, which spanned the 2011 calendar year. His total compensation decreased slightly from the year before because the schedule for bonus payments changed, GW spokeswoman Candace Smith said.
Historically, Knapp leads the pack among D.C. university presidents, outpacing Georgetown and American universities’ top leaders by tens of thousands of dollars. Many peer universities’ presidents, like those at New York, Boston, Northwestern and Vanderbilt, have also earned million-dollar salaries plus benefits.
Knapp’s salary is a blip on the University’s total about $800 million operating budget. But his seven-figure compensation has caught students’ attention as loan debt piles up and tuition prices increase.
Since he came to GW from Johns Hopkins University six years ago, Knapp has drawn praise from faculty for increasing lab space and internal dollars for research. The Board of Trustees, too, has rewarded Knapp by extending his five-year contract two years ago.
“I’m very excited about the direction in which we’re going,” Knapp said in a May interview. “We’re really trying to set the stage for moving the University to the next level.”
He added that one of the biggest challenges he has faced is getting “the message” out there in a “consistent” way.
The Board, made up of 36 alumni, donors and business leaders, sets Knapp’s salary and bonus levels each year based on how he reaches the governing body’s goals, as well as what goals he sets for himself.
Increasingly, the Board is focusing on how Knapp reaches fundraising levels, Board of Trustees Vice Chairman Nelson Carbonell said.
“We really want that incentive compensation to be real. We’re going to set aggressive goals. That’s part of the job,” said Carbonell, who will become chairman next month.
Carbonell, who helped recruit Knapp from Johns Hopkins University in 2007, said overall the Board is “really happy” with how Knapp has done.
The University has made a calculated push to build its donor base during Knapp’s administration, making it one of the central tasks of GW’s president. Historically, GW has much lower alumni giving rates than its peers, hurting how much the University can grow its bottom line.
In fiscal year 2012, the University pulled in $120 million, the most money for a single year ever. However, the growth rate slowed to 6 percent – far lower than the previous year’s growth of more than 21 percent.
The University has looked to incentivize GW’s top administrators to make stronger pitches to donors. Deans, colleges’ academic chiefs, now must spend 40 percent of their time fundraising, a sharp increase from before Knapp’s administration.
Scott Jaschik, the editor of the website Inside Higher Ed, said private university presidents’ most important task is bringing in money.
“With a private university like GW, fundraising is huge. It’s quite common for a president to be on the road for as much as they’re on campus,” Jashick said. “They’re not involved in the nitty-gritty. They’re away raising money and representing the university.”
Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz said all administrators have some of their compensation “at risk,” depending on how they hit the University’s targets for their departments.
Provost Steven Lerman also earned more than a half-million dollars, earning $749,555 last fiscal year. Lerman, the University’s second-in-command, oversees all academics, student life and admissions at the University. He was hired away from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2010, and also lives in University housing on the Mount Vernon Campus for free.
Mike Morsberger, GW’s fundraising chief, also earned $505,375 in total compensation
For fiscal year 2012, Knapp wasn’t the highest earner. Former Senior Associate Provost John “Skip” Williams made $1,088,821, plus more than $41,000 in other benefits during the last year he was at the institution. Carbonell attributed the difference to a few one-time payouts that accumulate during an administrator’s tenure and are added in once an administrator leaves.

A year after the University’s chief judicial officer said GW would alter the alcohol policy that graduate students have called cumbersome, they are still waiting on the University’s legal arm to approve those changes.
GW’s Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education aims to roll out an alcohol policy this fall that will include clearer language and more flexible standards for graduate students, like reducing the number of sober monitors required at networking events.
The changes, details of which are being kept under wraps, will come after nearly two years of student lobbying and testing aspects of a revised policy. Law students, who have led the charge for reform, hope the new policy will allow free alcohol to be served at networking events, which is not permitted under the University’s current policy.
“Our main concern is having [free drinks] at networking events because at a lot of our events we bring in attorneys from around the D.C. area to mingle with students, and for us to have to charge for something like that is a hurdle,” Student Bar Association’s alcohol policy liaison Nicole Tyrell said.
“This shows that disconnect between the policy as it applies to undergrads [and graduate students], because in the context of a sorority and fraternity party, you wouldn’t want to have free alcohol out all of the time,” she added.
The Center’s director, Alexis Janda, who joined GW in January 2012, tied the yearlong delay to a prolonged review process of a policy that will reshape oversight of alcohol and students in a mixture that could have serious legal implications.
The revamped policy will formally implement changes in effect since the fall, like reducing the required sober monitor ratio for graduate student events — from 1-to-20 to just one monitor for every 50 attendees — and holding individualized Responsible Alcohol Management trainings for specific graduate student groups.
And while the policy could bring a series of other changes to differentiate graduate and undergraduate students, Janda declined to share the potential changes until the Office of General Counsel concludes its review this summer.
Last summer, then-Assistant Dean of Students Tara Pereira said that a reworked policy would also relax registration requirements for graduate student events, but Janda declined to say whether these were still on the table.
Janda explained that she does not want to provoke any reactions from graduate students without knowing whether certain changes will be approved or turned down by GW’s legal office. Senior Vice President and General Counsel Beth Nolan declined to comment through a spokeswoman on the status of the policy review.
The new policy could also include changes for faculty and staff events with alcohol, which are currently governed by the blanket policy.
Tyrell attributed the delay in the policy’s roll-out to the initial lack of a point person on alcohol policy from her group, and said Janda’s arrival stalled the changes.
“She had other priorities, [she] wanted to get the office organized, to get other people on staff to be able to help her to implement something that made sense to her and not just that she was adopting from the previous leadership,” Tyrell said.
The law student group also pushed for revisions to include clearer and more specific language to prevent unintentional violations because of a misunderstanding of event registration requirements.
Janda said students echoed this sentiment during town hall-style events last spring, just months after she was hired.
“What I got from the listening tour was students were like, ‘Well, we’d like to be, kind of, more taught the policy,’ instead of it being a policy where it’s like, ‘Hey, read this and follow it,'” Janda explained, adding that she hopes to hold workshops to explain elements of the policy to students.
The policy workshops would be a welcome sight for law students, who are particularly wary of inadvertent disciplinary slips because racking up a disciplinary record during law school can hurt a student’s admission to a bar association.
But third-year law student Andrew Bayer said the Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education also needs to increase its educational outreach on substance abuse.
“CADE often times — knowingly or not — they worry too much about looking good and not enough about doing good,” Bayer, the Student Bar Association’s 2012-2013 programming director, said. “They care a lot about forms being submitted on time and signed by the right people.”
Bayer emphasized that over-stressed and overwhelmed law students would value increased programming and information about substance abuse that would help students during their time at GW and prepare them for responsible drinking in the legal world.
“We’ve had two [law] students in the past three years die of a drug or alcohol overdose,” he said, pointing to the deaths of Benjamin Gupta in 2011 and John Hroncich in 2012. Gupta died after mixing alcohol and oxycodone while Hroncich’s death was caused by a heroin and Adderall overdose.
“I haven’t seen one CADE staff member handing out a single flyer or putting on a single program trying to educate our community about how to deal with a high-stress job without resorting to dependence on drugs and alcohol,” Bayer added.

Mayoral candidate Jack Evans announces his candidacy Saturday, June 8. Evans has served as the Ward 2 Councilmember since 1996 and previously ran for mayor in 1998, coming in third place with 10 percent of the vote.
Jack Evans, a D.C. Council stalwart who represents neighborhoods like Foggy Bottom, officially announced his candidacy for mayor June 8, nearly completing the political picture for the District’s top office.
Evans, a Ward 2 D.C. Council member, said he would look to make D.C. “one of the greatest cities in the world,” and emphasized the diversity of the city and its need for continued growth in a speech at a 14th Street restaurant.
In front of about 100 supporters, Evans pledged to support the city’s different populations and small businesses by implementing a school-to-career pathway program to create jobs in the District’s key industries.
Evans, 59, said in a phone interview June 5 that his campaign will also focus on restructuring the education system, which has been marked by a growth of charter schools in recent years, leading to public school closures and mergers across the city. He also emphasized job growth, especially in D.C.’s low-income neighborhoods.
“People in many parts of the city have jobs, many don’t. Creation of jobs, and creating an educational structure that educates our residents for the jobs that exist, is really important,” he said.
Evans, who is not originally from the District, referred to the city as a “tapestry,” and first discussed the accomplishments of African-Americans, the city’s largest racial group. If elected, Evans will be the city’s first white mayor since Congress gave it home rule in 1973.
Peter Sacco, a junior who serves on the Advisory Neighborhood Council, said Evans will have a tough campaign, but that his long career of successful policy-making and finance acumen will help him.
“He was instrumental in passing marriage equality in the District, as well as working to increase the District’s bond rating to AA through his work as chair of the committee on finance and revenue,” Sacco said.
In March, Standard & Poor’s upgraded the District’s credit rating from A+ to AA-. The District reported a $140 million surplus at the beginning of fiscal year 2013.
The city’s longest-serving council member and a Democrat, Evans was first elected in 1991, and ran unopposed for his seat last fall. He could have difficulty garnering support outside of his own ward, especially when Muriel Bowser, a council member also running for mayor, represents Ward 4, the part of the city most dense with voters.
Evans said gathering supporters outside Wards 2 and 3 could be difficult, but was confident that his many years of experience would help.
“Having been around 22 years, people know who I am and think I’m doing a good job,” he said.
Ward 6 D.C. Council member Tommy Wells also announced his mayoral bid last month. Incumbent Vincent Gray has not yet announced whether he will run, but he hinted he may run when he criticized Bowser’s campaign in April.
During his first term, Gray came under fire for allegedly paying officials above the legal limit, and for paying a former mayoral candidate to attack his opponent. Several members of the mayor’s 2010 campaign team admitted to running a shadow campaign to help get him elected.
Junior Daniel Egel-Weiss, an Evans supporter, said his efforts to develop parts of the city, such as Chinatown, could help attract support.
“He built the Verizon Center, and then that whole area, it just exploded right after that,” he said. “He’s just been great in revitalizing a lot of neighborhoods in the District.”

Keith Crandall, director of the Computational Biology Institute, can see a new academic and research building under construction from his window at the Virginia Science and Technology Campus. The building's future purpose is unclear, but Crandall hopes it will provide more space for computational biology programs.
When researcher Keith Crandall looks outside the window of his spacious Virginia Science and Technology Campus office, he can see construction crews working to build on GW’s 120 acres in Loudoun County that administrators say go underused.
Crandall, who was hired away from Brigham Young University last year to run GW’s new Computational Biology Institute, said he believes he is at the center of GW’s growing research enterprise in Virginia. The University approved in May two new research centers that could be housed there, creating a cluster of interdisciplinary centers in computational biology, genomics and big data that could pave the way for GW’s first research park.
“When I came out here and took a look at the space and thought about what I want to do with the new institute is grow it. If I did this downtown, the growth potential was zero. The growth potential here is simply unlimited,” Crandall said.
The two centers, likely to cost about $10 million combined to start up, will begin searches for directors in the coming months and last over the next year or two, Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa said. A search for the leader of the genomics center will start this summer.
The cluster’s fields – sequencing the human genome and analyzing massive amounts of digital data – are growing at a rapid speed, as governments and businesses demand more research.
“This is an extremely topical area. It has implications for everything,” Chalupa said. “It has implications for policy. Do you want people to know everything about you, everything you’ve ever done? That’s stored somewhere.”
He added that the centers would bring in money for the University as demand for big data research rises. The University set aside about $30 million in its latest strategic plan to start new research centers in hopes that an improved research operation will help GW’s name power and revenue stream. GW is currently No. 99 in research expenditures in the country, according to the National Science Foundation.
Crandall said these topics are also critical for professors to jump into because they are being judged more critically by top administrators.
“In this new initiative to ramp up the research engine at GW, the report card is not publications anymore, it’s expenditures. How much is your unit spending per year on research? That’s the bottom line that these folks are looking at, he said. “We’ve each been given that direct charge.”
And much of that research growth is likely to come about a 45-minute bus ride away from the Foggy Bottom Campus, along a large stretch of highway in Ashburn, Va. Administrators are drafting a plan for the Virginia campus, which Crandall said could point to the start of a research park there – pairing professors and students with companies and startups.
The 120-acre campus has space for additional growth, although Senior Vice President for Operations Alicia Knight said there are no plans for additional construction in the next three years. The University is currently constructing its fifth building on the campus, half of which will be for conservations and museum collections — all in coordination with the GW Museum, which will be completed by October, Knight said.
About 30,000 square feet of the building will be used for research and teaching, but that space has not yet been doled out. Knight said they purposely designed the space for flexible use.
“On the first floor, we have a bigger floor-to-floor opening that might allow for easier hood hook-ups or infrastructure that might be needed if you wanted to do wet labs,” she explained.
The campus, opened by GW in 1991, houses about 20 academic programs, mainly graduate programs like computer science and information systems technology. Its research activity is mainly carried by work in car safety, energy and computing.
But Crandall said the Virginia campus must become more accessible to students and faculty if more centers will be successful. A free shuttle travels between the Foggy Bottom and Virginia campuses and provides free Wi-Fi, but shuttles only leave each campus every two hours, making the campus inconvenient for many professors and students.
Crandall said Virginia campus dean Ali Eskandarian has said it will cost $125,000 annually to run two shuttles to and from the campus each hour.
“Right now it doesn’t even make sense for folks to come here,” Crandall said. “But eventually, once we have our group here, I’m hoping that there will be enough incentive for people to be coming out here regularly to do collaborative stuff.”
