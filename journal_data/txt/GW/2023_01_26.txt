Like D.C.’s legendary local groundhog Potomac Phil, the Student Association has poked its head outside, taken a look around and finally done its job. After squabbles and scandals, internal restructuring and votes on cabinet positions and resolutions last year, the installation of a new contraception vending machine on campus last month demonstrates that the SA can get things done – and just how far it still has to go.
At a moment when the right to bodily autonomy is under threat across the country, convenient, stigma-free access to contraceptives helps ensure students’ health is in their hands – not those of government officials. The vending machine, which is located in the University Student Center, sells a generic, more affordable version of Plan B than nearby CVS as well as medical supplies like Tylenol, Advil and tampons.
The SA’s effort to make the vending machine a reality began over the summer after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. And now that it’s come to fruition, the machine’s installation is a rare success for the SA. Neharika Rao, a sophomore and the SA’s executive secretary of diversity, equity and inclusion, and Aiza Saeed, a senior and the executive cabinet’s communications director, led the effort alongside SA President Christian Zidouemba. After Zidouemba approached Northeastern University over the summer about its plans to install a similar vending machine in October, Rao and Saeed “worked directly” with members of the Office of Student Life to execute the plan.
More accessible and affordable contraception available directly on campus is a step forward for GW. But this is a case of meeting – not exceeding – expectations. The push to install the vending machine tells a different story than what the SA has, or more accurately hasn’t, been up to this year.
Zidouemba’s presidency got off to a shaky start when members of his cabinet attempted to remove him from office over the summer. Zidouemba allegedly threatened to fire SA members for using their titles in an open letter demanding that GW remove Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas from lecturing at GW Law after he voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Though Zidouemba retained his position, the whole debacle – which involved a four-month-long Student Court lawsuit – cost the SA time it could have spent advocating for students.
Once the school year rolled around, the SA spent more of its energy restructuring itself to represent students than actually representing them. Fourteen of the 33 bills the SA Senate passed last semester approved nominees for a variety of positions within the student government. Another 10 pieces of legislation dealt solely with reforming the senate’s internal processes, like allowing senators to hold multiple committee leadership positions and removing the requirement that a chairperson of one committee must be a member of another.
With the vending machine, the SA demonstrated its potential to act as a conduit to convey students’ concerns to officials as GW undergoes a period of historic change. Though the scale of the vending machine project pales in comparison to the University’s search for its third president in three years or its highly anticipated replacement for the Colonials moniker, students needed – and still need – their voice to be heard on these issues.
We don’t expect our peers to retroactively handpick GW’s next president or paint Foggy Bottom hippopotamus gray over officials’ heads. But when it comes to major University-wide decisions, students need a larger seat at the table – let alone one in the room. Zidouemba, who received a little more than half of the 2,690 votes cast in last year’s SA elections, was the sole student included in the 17-member Presidential Search Committee. And while officials are conducting focus groups with students to garner input on the new moniker, they officially ruled out the student-favorite Hippos last month.
Without student input, the changes coming to GW may leave the overly bureaucratic systems in place at the University and its longstanding culture of racism and discrimination practically untouched. But it’s impossible for students to make their thoughts known when the governing body tasked with conveying them to officials would rather spar over parliamentary procedure than take a unified stand. The SA’s members must be mature and capable enough to present the needs, wants and occasional demands of GW’s thousands of students to officials.
Recent SA administrations have set and met even greater expectations. Last year, SA Vice President Kate Carpenter spearheaded efforts to expand SafeRide and advocate for U-Pass, which together made it easier, safer and more convenient to travel around Foggy Bottom and D.C. Besides a career fair planned for Feb. 10 and a commission for students to voice concerns about GW offices created last semester, the vending machine will be one of the only concrete achievements that most students will remember from this SA’s whole term. Make no mistake, the vending machine is a good first step – students asked, and their representatives answered. But when SA members vie for students’ votes later this year, they should expect to get quite a few blank looks – and ballots – in return.
This should be an inflection point for the SA. What could have been if they spent more time fighting for students instead of bickering over bylaws? Spring is coming soon, and the SA shouldn’t go back into hibernation.

Pro-choice protesters rallied across the country Sunday.
Hundreds of pro-choice demonstrators gathered in front of the Supreme Court Sunday for the 2023 Women’s March, exactly 50 years after the landmark – and now-reversed – 1973 Roe v. Wade decision granted the constitutional right to abortion, with protesters calling on lawmakers to restore abortion rights nationwide. 
Pro-choice protesters rallied across the country Sunday calling on lawmakers to codify abortion rights into law, with the central rally taking place in Madison, Wisconsin, to highlight the state’s upcoming special election which could alter the makeup of its Supreme Court and dictate the fate of statewide abortion access. Demonstrators in the District said they felt “frustrated” but “hopeful” in their calls to broaden abortion protections across the country following the 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade.
Sena Waver, a D.C. resident and pro-choice demonstrator, said the pro-choice movement “really matters” to her because her grandmother had a life-threatening abortion in Romania when abortion was illegal in the country. 
“I thought that we were over this, I thought that my grandmothers, they had to go through this,” she said. “And I thought that that was in the past now.”
Waver said she attended the Women’s March in 2017 to protest former President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a demonstration she said was broadly about women’s rights compared to this year, which focused on abortion rights. She said she is “not super hopeful” for the state of abortion rights over the next two years now that Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in the November elections. 
Ommy Miranda Martone, a pro-choice demonstrator and a D.C. resident, said she decided to march this year to show that despite the Supreme Court’s reversal Roe v. Wade, limiting reproductive control is an “unpopular” decision lacking national support.
“If y’all don’t do what you said you were going to do, there’s other ways to get other parties in this country and there’s other ways to get things done,” Martone said.
Martone said she hopes to see lawmakers codify the right to abortion, a move she said lawmakers should have taken “a long time ago” under the Obama administration. She said it’s upsetting to see protesters continuing to demand action on reproductive rights 50 years after the Supreme Court established constitutional protections to abortion in 1973. 
“We’re literally progressing past where we were in the ’70s,” Martone said.
Emma Hussey, a D.C. resident and a pro-choice demonstrator, said she hopes to see legislative protection from lawmakers on reproductive rights, making abortion legal on a federal level. She said she also hopes to see more inclusivity integrated into the pro-choice movement to ensure all people capable of giving birth are represented in conversations advocating for broadened abortion protections.
“It’s not just women, but individuals with uteruses,” Hussey said.
Hussey said it was important to her to march on the 50-year anniversary of Roe v. Wade to continue the legacy of fighting for reproductive rights that was led by the generations of pro-choice advocates before her. She said she felt “emotional” throughout the day’s march, even tearing up while witnessing the momentum of the march through the streets. 
“Just to see the amount of people that have shown up and different people who have shown up to fight for what we believe in, it’s very, very powerful,” Hussey said.

WMATA officials also announced in a Tweet Thursday that riders can expect increased train frequency on the Blue line stretch from Rosslyn to Stadium-Armory stations, down from a seven-minute wait between trains to a train every three and a half minutes.
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority officials announced trains will begin running more frequently starting Feb. 7, decreasing rider wait times.
The Blue, Orange and Blue+ lines’ wait times will decrease by three minutes, dropping to 12-minute intervals between trains from 6 to 9 a.m. and 3 to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday. Starting Feb. 21, Red line trains will depart every eight minutes between 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, a two-minute drop from the current wait time.
WMATA officials also announced in a Tweet Thursday that riders can expect increased train frequency on the Blue line stretch from Rosslyn to Stadium-Armory stations, down from a seven-minute wait between trains to a train every three and a half minutes. 
Wait times for the Green and Silver lines will remain unchanged at eight and 15 minutes between trains, respectively, the release states.
“Future improvements to rail frequency will be announced in the coming months, as Metro gradually adds back service to meet growing ridership,” the release states.
The trains’ increased frequency comes as part of WMATA officials’ plan to increase 7000-series rail car service after a Blue line derailment outside of the Rosslyn station in October 2021. WMATA officials periodically introduced some 7000-series railcars in June and September, and officials fully restored service for the railcars in November following the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission’s approval of Metro’s revised safety plan for their 7000-series cars.
Last week, officials announced the WMSC approved WMATA’s transition to Phase 3 of its Return to Service Plan, which decreases the frequency of 7000-series inspections and allows Metro to use low-press tonnage axles on its cars after WMATA reported some axles failing their evaluation of railcar safety. Prior to the announcement last week, WMATA petitioned WSMC’s directives which sidelined 50 railcar operators and stalled return plans, WSMC approved the petition and avoided potential delays.
“Our ability to move from a 4 to 7-day inspection interval will gradually allow us to train staff with this improved process and work towards the safe implementation of improved service for our customers,” officials said in a Tweet.
Officials also said in the release that all Orange Line trains will have eight railcars to provide more capacity than the six-car trains they’re currently providing.
Randy Clarke, WMATA general manager and chief executive officer, said WMATA is “excited” to see these changes where travelers “most need them.”
“By making trains more frequent and increasing capacity with more 8-car trains, we are reducing crowding and making service more convenient,” Clarke said in the release.
The release states railcar availability is half of the “equation” to more service, citing the shortage of Metro employees. Officials said employee vacancies are down to 1,400 from last summer’s 1,900 vacancies, but Metro is looking to recruit more employees with hiring bonuses and “competitive” wages and benefits offerings.
“Our veteran and growing workforce has demonstrated our deep commitment to safety as we work continuously to bring the Metrorail system back to full strength,” Clarke said.

ADC alleges that StandWithUs “wrongfully accused” Sheehi of antisemitism and argues the organization harbors anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian sentiments. The allegations center around a class Sheehi taught in the Professional Psychology Program, housed in 1922 F Street.
A civil rights organization working to stop anti-Arab discrimination is defending a professor who a Jewish and pro-Israel advocacy group accused of antisemitism earlier this month, according to a press release Tuesday.
The Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee agreed to represent Lara Sheehi, an assistant professor of clinical psychology who StandWithUs filed a Title VI complaint against in the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, accusing her of being antisemitic toward Jewish and Israeli students in her graduate-level Diversity I course. ADC alleges that StandWithUs “wrongfully accused” Sheehi of antisemitism and that the organization harbors anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian sentiments.
“As in other campaigns, StandWithUs has targeted Dr. Sheehi by mobilizing their allies in the right-wing media and other pro-Israel organizations with the explicit intent to threaten her safety, well-being, professional reputation and livelihood,” the press release states.
StandWithUs’ complaint alleges that GW faculty members and administrators brought “disciplinary proceedings” against students in Sheehi’s course who voiced concerns about Sheehi’s “hostile” conduct. The students also said the course’s guest speaker and three of the course readings on the Israel-Palestine conflict portrayed Israel and Jewish people negatively “within the greater context of antisemitism in the class.”
“ADC is proud to represent Dr. Lara Sheehi, an internationally recognized clinician, scholar, activist and beloved professor whose Arab identity and work on mental health in Palestine have led her to be unjustly persecuted by those who seek to censor and harass scholars and supporters of justice,” ADC’s press release states.
ADC’s press release states that the University set a “chilling precedent” by planning to launch a third-party investigation of StandWithUs’ claims after officials allegedly cleared Sheehi of the students’ accusations through “internal processes” in the fall 2022 semester. ADC communicated their concerns with officials’ handling of the Title VI complaint against Sheehi, according to the press release.
“We are confident that when all information is made public, the intent behind this politically motivated harassment campaign against Dr. Sheehi will be evident,” the press release states.
Students for Justice in Palestine posted a now-expired Instagram story, expressing support for ADC’s defense of Sheehi.
“We proudly stand in support of Palestinian faculty at this school wrongfully accused by Zionists,” the Instagram story stated.

While “Velma” manages to land occasional laughs and touch on somewhat-clever concepts, it’s hard to recommend a show that seems to be filled with so much disdain for its original concept.
In the latest “Scooby-Doo” spin-off to hit the small screen, “Velma” strays as far as it can from the renowned gang of high school sleuths, delivering an all-out disappointment for franchise fans.
Serving as a TV-MA reimagining of “Scooby-Doo,” Mindy Kaling’s latest effort “Velma” – which premiered on HBO Max earlier this month – promised adult jokes while capturing the original magic of the series with a murder mystery central to its plot. But the animated high school drama is riddled with an unfunny attempt at self-referential meta-humor that feels closer to the cringe-worthy CW teen drama “Riverdale” than anything “Scooby-Doo” related.
With the exception of the pilot – which sets up the murders of the show and Velma’s struggles over her mom’s disappearance – the six episodes released so far, out of 10 total, revolve around dramatic high school love triangles and social cliques instead of classic mystery-solving hijinks. The high school setting feels tired and played out, making liberal use of meta-jokes to make fun of common dry cliches and high school tropes. It feels as if Kaling and showrunner Charlie Grandy believe that as long as they poke fun at the show’s flaws, they don’t have to do anything to remedy them. The result is a production magnifying the worst aspects of its writing and expecting praise for it.
The show explores uncharted “Scooby-Doo” territory in the characters’ high school through issues like mental health and sexual identity. Unfortunately, these topics are handled clumsily enough to border on offensive. Velma suffers frequent episodes of hallucinations and anxiety, but the depictions of these episodes are frequently downplayed and minimized. Velma is able to turn these hallucinations on and off like a switch in certain instances. She takes laughable steps to escape her anxiety, in one episode making her best friend embarrassingly confess his feelings for her.
Viewers also get to see Velma and Daphne explore their blossoming feelings for one another. While the popular fan pairing was exciting to see on TV, Velma’s constant obsession over Fred makes this feel like an even less progressive take on the character’s sexuality than the mainline “Scooby-Doo” series, which has committed to portraying Velma as a lesbian in the 2022 film “Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo!” after being forced to remove her sexuality from the script in 2001.
Along with the updated setting, Kaling reimagines the core cast of characters unrecognizable as their original versions with new personality traits and even names. Most notably, Shaggy Rogers is no more, now going by Norville. Norville is a far cry from Shaggy – he appears well put together and has an explicit disdain for marijuana and its culture. Fred is an arrogant, spoiled, rich kid instead of a trap-obsessed doofus who loves his friends. Velma is a snarky, sarcastic and generally miserable human being with none of her trademark intellect. Instead of the simple and loveable depictions seen in other “Scooby-Doo” media, “Velma” consists of archetypical parodies of characters pulled out of thin air.
The series’ sole saving grace is its impeccable voice actors. Glenn Howerton brings a hilariously entitled energy to Fred that elevates the character above the poor writing and manages to deliver some genuine laughs with the trite material he’s given. Constance Wu gives an enigmatic performance as Daphne, capturing the queen-bee essence of her character. Sam Richardson as Norville would be a delight if the character wasn’t such a frustration any time he is on the screen. Even Kaling brings the same sarcasm and confidence her fans have come to love, and while this characterization is still an odd choice for the more socially inept Velma, her performance makes the character the least bit more bearable.
It’s hard not to feel as if this show was meant to be something else altogether, dislodged from the “Scooby-Doo” cinematic universe. After all, what sort of “Scooby-Doo” project centers around judgy high school cliques or the trial of Fred Jones, who is bizarrely charged for murder despite no real evidence against him? The glaring lack of any character’s authenticity, a concrete mystery and even the presence of Scooby-Doo himself come together to create an identity crisis for “Velma.”
Simply put, “Velma” is a show with no respect for its audience or its source material. “Scooby-Doo” may be a franchise for children, but the writers should still treat it with respect. Although the show is written for adults, the only viewers who will find any wit or charm here are too young to be watching it.
While “Velma” manages to land occasional laughs and touch on somewhat-clever concepts, it’s hard to recommend a show that seems to be filled with so much disdain for its original concept. Instead of parodying “Scooby-Doo” out of a genuine love for the series and its characters, the writers seem to resent their ties to the franchise. The result is a show that feels full of anger and hate instead of any desire to be a smart take on a beloved franchise. If you’re looking to recapture the childhood magic you felt watching “Scooby-Doo,” go watch the original series. But whatever you do, do not watch “Velma.”

Like many members of Gen Z, watching “Glee” defined my first experiences with pop culture in elementary and middle school. Every Wednesday at 9 p.m., I tuned into Fox to watch the McKinley High students compete in show choir competitions and reimagine iconic songs from Amy Winehouse, Journey and Barbra Streisand. The paradigmatic show raised a generation of young teens and drew a loyal fan base that followed the actors’ personal lives just as much as their onscreen storylines.
When the Emmy-award winning series premiered more than a decade ago, it turned actors like Lea Michele, Darren Criss and Amber Riley into household names. The cast of young performers struck a chord with their raw talent, brilliant comedic timing and catchy renditions of classic songs, rising from obscurity to Broadway and even performing at the White House. And “Glee” is looked back on today as a pioneering force in the TV industry that placed LGBTQ+ characters front and center.
So when the trailer for the three-part documentary “The Price of Glee” was released last month, Twitter turned into a frenzy of theories, debates and questions about the ethics of creating a commentary about the unrelated deaths of “Glee” cast members Cory Monteith, Mark Salling and Naya Rivera. While some fans were curious to hear general behind-the-scenes gossip from the show, others condemned the documentary entirely, pointing to the fact that not a single cast member endorsed the Discovery+ production.
The hit musical comedy series ran from 2009 to 2015 but has recently resurged in pop culture due to Michele’s record-breaking revival of “Funny Girl” on Broadway, which became a central pillar of her character on the show. Discovery+ has capitalized on the series’ recent popularity with this tasteless documentary lacking any real substantiated claims about their deaths and resorting to empty theories at the expense of the entire cast. Despite their curiosity about what transpired on set, fans of the show should not support or stream “The Price of Glee.” The docuseries lacks any new, verified or even compelling information and is nothing more than a cheap attempt to monetize and profit off of a cast who has already gone through immense loss.
The show’s first episode centers around Monteith, who died of a drug overdose in 2013 before the start of “Glee”’s fifth season. Monteith – who played Finn Hudson, the star quarterback turned glee club member – was engaged to Michele in real life at the time of his tragic death. “The Price of Glee” also touches on the death of Rivera, who played outspoken cheerleader Santana Lopez and died in 2020 after strong winds and currents caused her to drown in Lake Piru, California.
But sandwiched between discussions of Monteith and Rivera, the series takes an insensitive and offensive dive into the death of Salling, who played Noah Puckerman and died by suicide in 2018, just six weeks before he was scheduled to be sentenced to four to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography. While it is uncommon for a single cast to have multiple deceased members in their 30s, the similarities between Monteith, Salling and Rivera end there – they happened to work together a decade ago. Equating two good-natured people, particularly one who struggled with addiction, to a child predator is not only in poor taste, but it brings all three of their deaths to the surface yet again, setting up the cast members who dealt with them in various capacities to be further traumatized.
A multitude of cast members have condemned the documentary, but its sole claim to relevancy to the show itself comes in the form of entertainment reporters – most of whom were not covering the show while it was filming – and crew members who worked on the show in the background for a small window of time. Dugg Kirkpatrick, who worked as the head of the “Glee” hair department during Season 3, alleged that a cast member told Monteith they would support him if he wanted to have a drink at a party, which ultimately led to his overdose because “it sent him on a path to destruction.” No other cast or crew member has ever substantiated this encounter, and the narrative that someone else is to blame for an overdose is harmful to those who suffer from addiction and their loved ones.
Christopher Baffa, the director of photography from Seasons 1 to 3, attributed the disconnected deaths to the “Glee curse,” or the offensive conspiracy theory that the deaths of Monteith, Salling and Rivera are somehow linked. Patrick Chisolm, the assistant key locations director, asked, “If Cory had never acted in Glee, would he still be hanging around the corner?” Monteith had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse more than a decade before acting on “Glee,” so correlating his addiction to the show or anyone on it is solely an effort to create falsehoods. The documentary even references these conflicting facts, showcasing its illegitimacy even further.
Aside from vaguely involved crew members, “The Price of Glee” features Stacy Kaiser, a psychotherapist who never treated or even met a single “Glee” cast member. She theorizes the fame associated with “Glee” was behind Monteith’s overdose and Salling’s child pornography arrest. Actor Stephen Kramer Glickman, who introduced himself by saying “I was one of the stars of ‘Big Time Rush’ on Nickelodeon, which shot at Paramount studios about 50 feet away from the TV show ‘Glee’” also takes on a completely undeserved role in the series. Glickman claims he and Monteith were friends – evidenced by a vague, one-line email he says Monteith sent him and video footage of the two standing near one another.
“The Price of Glee” ultimately boils down to a cheap exploitation of two talented young performers’ deaths by positioning them in the same vein as a sex offender, grasping at straws to link all three of their deaths to “Glee” and the entertainment industry. If the makers of this documentary wanted to honor the “Glee” cast members, they would have asked permission from their close friends and castmates instead of making unfounded claims against them. Fans of “Glee” should continue to enjoy everything the show was but let Monteith and Rivera rest without theorizing about their deaths or comparing them to Salling.

The New York Magazine sparked an online craze over “nepo babies” last month after publishing a front-page feature plastered with a baby-bodied illustration of celebrities like Ben Platt, Maude Apatow and Zoë Kravitz filling a hospital nursery.
The New York Magazine cover exposes 5’3″ models like Lily-Rose Depp who benefit from their parental ties despite their lack of industry credentials. But the nepo-baby conversation also affords GW a time of introspection – the University has its own class of underqualified students who somehow landed prestigious government internships by riding on their family’s coattails. So the next cover of The Cherry Tree ought to look something similar to that of the New York Magazine. I’m envisioning well-connected students with influential families holding congressional intern IDs and VIP cards on the hardbound cover, paying homage to the generational legacies weaving through our student culture.
Nepotism babies – dubbed “nepo babies” in the recent internet trend – are children of influential people who get ahead using their family’s connections, money or fame. The first widespread use of the catchy, shortened term started on TikTok and inspired other deep-dive videos on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. Viral videos revealed models, politicians and actors’ already well-established lineages within their respective industries for the world to see. Netizens debated whether the celebrities in question were actually good at their job or if their parents were master puppeteers.
I knew I had my work cut out for me as a first-generation university student when I enrolled at GW, but little did I know, I would be competing with GW’s nepotism babies for even entry-level internships. Everyone fantasizes about being famous and rich, but most people don’t have the parents or connections to achieve their wildest aspirations with just their last name. I grew up in Stafford, Virginia alongside the children of CEOs, international lawyers and heirs to multinational corporations. But the wealth in my hometown was nothing like the status I’ve come to witness during my first semester at GW. My high school classmates may have boats, but now my peers don’t hesitate to drop thousands of dollars on a flight to the Caribbean for just a weekend trip.
I’ve always been aware of the fact that GW students were among some of the wealthiest and most privileged students in academia, but I didn’t anticipate my classmates being part of the elite club of D.C. government socialites. Any major university has its celebrity kids, but GW is better known for those who skip airport security with their diplomatic passports. Some students I’ve met so far are the grandchildren of previous ambassadors, enigmatic international students and students who vaguely talk about their parents’ prestigious careers in government or business. As a GW student, it’s clear most of my peers have their opportunities handed to them educationally and financially. And they have a cushy, designer net to fall back on if they can’t make it without their family’s name in their back pockets.
GW’s history of nepotism babies dates back to the 1800s on the heels of the University’s founding in 1821. Dozens of influential people have attended GW, earning their degrees and eventually their jobs by way of their parents’ connections. Alumnus and Energy Minister of Pakistan Omar Ayub Khan is the grandson of Pakistan’s former President Muhammad Ayub Khan. Children of presidents Gerald Ford, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Dwight Eisenhower attended GW. Eisenhower’s grandson received his doctorate degree from GW Law in 1976 and also happens to be President Richard Nixon’s son-in-law.
Expansive alumni network aside, I didn’t come to GW to dine at Western Market with silver spoons. I came for the opportunities the University marketed for me – White House internships and classes with the most qualified professors in my field of study. As for my academic career, I’m set. My professional career, on the other hand, I worry about. I’ve had to deal with getting passed over for the more experienced, polished, well-connected candidate – spoiler alert: not every Elliott kid is destined to be a Hilltern. Trying to start a career in a generationally interwoven city has me chasing transient opportunities far out of reach.
My gratitude for the opportunities I’ve encountered outweighs my bitterness for feeling like the second choice as I’ve come to understand that oftentimes being passed over isn’t personal. I still feel lucky enough and motivated to be educated alongside some of the smartest and most hard-working people I’ve ever met, even if they have a giant yacht docked in Portofino and a trust fund locked up until they’re 25. They might have the leg up, but I landed my first official – albeit unpaid – internship this semester nevertheless. When I watch my friends be hired for prestigious paid internships on the Hill with Congresspeople and lobbyists alike, it still stings. As a first-generation student, I have to navigate the development of my career without the experiences of my parents and grandparents, but I’m grateful that I even have the opportunity to complain.
Nepotism babies’ trajectories may be forged in their private boarding schools, but it’s not their fault for being born with connections. When I retire from my career, I can only hope that my family and I have the connections that some of my peers were born with – and if I were in their position, I’d certainly take advantage of my resources. D.C.’s web is entangling, but I care more about how the nepotism babies of this generation apply their inherent education and power than any fame they achieve.

About nine Taylor Swift fans mobilized in front of the Capitol Tuesday, urging Live Nation Entertainment, the product of Ticketmaster and Live Nation’s 2010 merger, to break up after being unable to purchase presale tickets for the pop star’s upcoming tour in November.
Protestors rallied outside of the U.S. Capitol building Tuesday, calling on lawmakers to break up ticketing company Live Nation Entertainment during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing focused on the lack of competition within the live event ticketing industry.
About nine Taylor Swift fans mobilized in front of the Capitol Tuesday, urging Live Nation Entertainment, the product of Ticketmaster and Live Nation’s 2010 merger, to break up after being unable to purchase presale tickets for the pop star’s upcoming tour in November. But during the protest outside Congress, inside the building, members of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights met with live event ticketing authorities and entertainment industry professionals, expressing their concern about the company’s potential monopoly over the industry.
Jennifer Kinder – an attorney from Kinder Law, which is representing more than 300 plaintiffs filing lawsuits against Ticketmaster because of their experience during Swift’s ticket presale – attended the protest, sporting a T-shirt with the ticket vendor’s logo crossed out. She said she helped organize the event and hopes the Senate can take some “real strong measures” to “punish” and break up Ticketmaster-Live Nation.
“What they can do is they can really control the monopoly, they can change it, they can deconstruct it, they can break the whole thing up, that’s what Congress can do,” Kinder said.
The Ticketmaster site crashed in November during the presale for Swift’s stadium tour, “Eras,” and many fans who queued online to purchase a seat waited for hours before running out of luck, with thousands of fans unable to purchase tickets to the tour.
Penny Harrison, one of the lawsuit’s plaintiffs, held a sign reading, “Ticketswindler, your reputation’s never been worse.” She said she joined Kinder at the protest because of her experience at Swift’s presale and her belief that there is no industry “competition” after the merger.
She said ticket sales after the 2010 merger agreement have exponentially increased ticket prices. She added that she wants to see antitrust campaigns that spark more industry competition and more affordable ticket prices for the public.
“I hope that the Senate will understand that there was a mistake that was made back in 2010, when the DOJ allowed them to actually merge and create one large company,” Harrison said.
The Justice Department approved the merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation in 2010 under a requirement that Ticketmaster gives Anschutz Entertainment Group access to its ticketing software so that the group could compete with Ticketmaster and prohibit LNE from retaliating against venues that abandon it for a competing ticketing service.
Since the merger, Live Nation Entertainment has continued to acquire complete ownership and majority stakes in numerous entertainment companies, further consolidating the live event industry and increasing its market share within the industry.
Jenn Landry, a protester from Houston, TX, said her experience with obtaining tickets was a “horror story” because of the high prices and long wait times. She said the plaintiffs are suing for “answers.”
“I’m really sorry that this happened to you, and you have a voice, too,” Landry said. 
The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition, Antitrust and Consumer Rights led the hearing. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-MN, and Mike Lee, R-UT, called upon witnesses in the live event ticketing industry, including President and Chief Financial Officer of Live Nation Entertainment Joe Berchtold, SeatGeek Chief Executive Officer Jack Groetzinger and JAM Productions CEO Jerry Mickelson.
Berchtold said at the Senate hearing that fans and bots trying to buy tickets and resell them on secondary websites overran the Ticketmaster website during the Swift concert sale.
“We knew bots would attack that on-sale and planned accordingly,” Berchtold said. “We were then hit with three times the amount of bot traffic than we had ever experienced.”
Mickelson said fans should be voicing their concern about the extreme prices resulting from the Ticketmaster-Live Nation monopoly.
“The fan is getting, let’s just say, screwed,” Mickelson said. “They can’t afford to go to the shows that are taking place because of the greed that Ticketmaster wants to pay for their bottom line.”
Senators also called upon Clyde Lawrence, a singer and songwriter for the soul-pop band Lawrence, Kathleen Bradish, vice president for legal advocacy at the American Antitrust Institute and Sal Nuzzo, senior vice president of The James Madison Institute, an economic policy think tank on issues affecting Floridians.
Lawrence, who testified on behalf of his self-titled band, said fans would be “surprised” to find out how much the artists receive from ticket sales, citing how artists don’t receive any part of the service fees Ticketmaster adds during sales. He said it is ultimately up to Congress to “reckon” with the Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger.
“If the way the pie is being divided up isn’t fair for the artist, you’re gonna have more and more artists not able to break even on tour,” Lawrence said.
Nuzzo said he hopes the hearing shows the “complex nature” of the practices of companies like Live Nation Entertainment and how they impact consumers, as well as presenting a timeline of the monopoly and its effects.
“One player has such a dominant position that they’re able to kind of exert their will on just about everything in the industry and, in a way, integrate that,” he said. “Ultimately, as you could, as you probably heard, it harms the bands, harms the venues and harms consumers.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, said the statement Ticketmaster put out in response to the presale website crash – that Swift would have to perform “a stadium show every single night for the next 2.5 years” to meet the high demand for the Era’s Tour – implied the “debacle” was Swift’s fault.
“Ticketmaster ought to look in the mirror and say ‘I’m the problem. It’s me,’” Blumenthal said.

The coalition is urging officials to disclose the sources of externally funded research and create annual reports on fundraising from corporations and nonprofits. 
A coalition of student organizations and faculty launched a campaign earlier this month calling on officials to publicly disclose the sources of GW’s funding.
The Coalition for Ethics and Transparency – which includes 14 student organizations and 17 professors representing five of GW’s schools – sent a letter calling on officials to disclose “restricted gifts,” one-time donations to GW that fund an initiative that a donor selects and total more than $50,000 from for-profit and nonprofit entities. The coalition is urging officials to disclose the sources of externally funded research, create annual reports on fundraising from corporations and nonprofits and implement the Environmental, Social and Governance Responsibility task force’s 2022 recommendations to produce “timely” and “accessible” investment reporting.
“By taking the steps we call for today, GW has the opportunity to become a more accountable and transparent institution, and a leader across higher education,” the letter states.
The Board of Trustees dissolved the ESG task force in May, two years after it started drafting recommended changes to the University’s environmental practices, following a yearslong student campaign to end GW’s investments in the fossil fuel industry. The task force outlined a plan to completely divest GW’s endowment from the fossil fuel industry by 2025, which the Board adopted in June 2020.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said the University received the letter from the coalition, which includes organizations like Sunrise GW, Jewish Voice for Peace, Student for Justice in Palestine and Students Against Imperialism, and officials will “review its recommendations.”
“The University has policies and practices in place related to receiving and disclosing research funding and gifts,” she said in an email. “We regularly review such policies and practices, make appropriate updates and ensure they are aligned with best practices to support academic freedom and transparency.”
Metjian declined to comment on if trustees are on track to divest from the fossil fuel industry by 2025 and how officials are increasing transparency in external research funding from for-profit and nonprofit institutions.
Bella Kumar, a sophomore and member of Sunrise GW, said she and other students formed the coalition out of concern about GW’s reported acceptance of “dirty money,” which she said are funds dependent on the “destruction of different aspects of life,” like the climate.
Former University President Thomas LeBlanc openly disclosed to a student in a 2020 video that the University, at the time, devoted three percent of its investments to the fossil fuel industry.
“The overarching goal of this funding transparency campaign is obviously to get the transparency that students deserve and need, but also give us a way to say, ‘Look, GW has told us that they are taking this money. We don’t have to do this research on our own anymore,’” Kumar said.
Kumar said she and other Sunrise members reached out to faculty who previously committed to not taking any fossil fuel money for research to ask them to join the coalition. She said the coalition rolled out a written resolution for schools and departments to commit to disclosing the sources of their funding.
“The coalition is going after departments who are sympathetic to the cause, who are pro-transparency, and ask them to sort of formulate their own database, a Google Sheet, whatever that looks like for them, that has their funding in it that we can see and that is updated and made public,” she said.
Kumar said the coalition will push for officials to fulfill these goals by the end of the spring semester.
Six professors whose names were signed onto the letter declined to comment on their involvement in the coalition or said they weren’t involved enough in the coalition to comment.
Aza Evans-Townsend, a junior majoring in journalism and mass communication and a member of Sunrise GW, said a petition calling on the administration to implement the coalition’s demands has hit 218 signatures as of Wednesday.
Evans-Townsend said Sunrise has learned that academic entities at GW, like the Regulatory Studies Center – a GW research center focused on policy analysis of government regulations – are often reliant on funding from private corporations to conduct research. Sunrise GW led a 12-hour sit-in at the RSC office in November to protest the center’s ties to the fossil fuel industry.
“One of the main things we know is that without funding from private corporations, they would be unable to do the research that they’re doing,” Evans-Townsend said. “So it is clear that there’s a reliance on something, which then sort of impedes faculty from being able to do research if they don’t have it.”
Lance Lokas, the president of Students for Justice in Palestine, said he helped write the coalition letter to “mobilize” the student body and create a space where students know they can rectify their concerns. He said students who are involved in research on campus may not know if the funding of their projects come from weapons manufacturing companies, like Lockheed Martin – which earned billions of dollars from a weapons sale to Saudi Arabia’s government as it wages war against Yemen.
The Elliott School of International Affairs received funding from weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin in 2013, according to the 2013-14 annual school report.
“There are a lot of students who are part of our members or who are just within the community that we usually interact with, like Palestinians, Arab students, who are involved in research and who don’t know where this one thing is coming from,” Lokas said. “It could be coming from weapon manufacturers, defense contractors, people who are actively involved in exporting war and violence overseas that directly affect people here at GW.”
Ivy Ken, an associate professor of sociology and women’s gender and sexuality studies who signed onto the coalition’s letter, said the public has a right to know what companies are funding professors’ research and the University’s academic institutions.
“If a faculty member or a center at GW wants to accept Koch money, they should face public pressure to reveal it and to defend their decision, given the Koch men’s long-term plan to undermine democracy in the U.S.,” Ken said in an email.
Koch Industries owner and businessman Charles Koch gave $81.7 million through his personal foundation to 140 universities and colleges across the country in 2021, including GW, which received slightly more than $500,000 in funds.
David Karpf, an associate professor of Media and Public Affairs said professors should be “insistent” on passing the coalition’s demands.
“I joined the coalition because this is something that GW should already be doing, and when large organizations aren’t already doing a thing they should be doing, it usually takes a little bit of coordination or effort to get them there,” Karpf said in an interview. “So I was happy to join the coalition because there’s no reason we should not be doing this.”
