Officials scaled back GW’s mask policy last month to only require masking in indoor instructional settings, GW-operated transportation and University health care facilities after requiring masks in all indoor spaces through the majority of the pandemic.
Students are retiring their masks in classrooms and on the Mount Vernon Express without reprimand from faculty or staff while GW’s mask mandate in instructional and transportation settings remains in place.
Students said they’ve been experiencing “mask fatigue” on campus in light of recent relaxations to mask and testing policies this semester, pulling back from the added “hassle” of masking in required on-campus areas. More than 40 students said they’ve noticed their peers attending classes and boarding the Vex unmasked while faculty and staff fail to enforce GW’s mandate. 
Officials updated GW’s mask policy earlier this month to only require masking in indoor instructional settings, GW-operated transportation and University health care facilities after requiring masks in all indoor spaces through the majority of the pandemic. During the summer, the University transitioned to an isolation-in-place policy for students who test positive for COVID and dropped its asymptomatic testing requirement, leaving high-risk students concerned about asymptomatic cases going unnoticed.
University spokesperson Tim Pierce said masks continue to be mandatory in classrooms and lecture halls as well as on the Vex, the Virginia Science and Technology Campus Express and inside SafeRide vehicles. 
“The University will continue to monitor rates of COVID-19 on its campuses and in the region and will revisit the masking instructions as appropriate,” Pierce said in an email. 
Esabella Vasquez, a freshman studying international affairs, said she has noticed a “majority” of students ride the Vex unmasked, but she continues to wear a mask while commuting for her own comfort and to comply with University policy. She said she feels uneasy sitting near students commuting without masks in an enclosed space, especially if they are showing signs of sickness.
“If someone’s coughing and you’re behind me or you’re next to me, I’m going to get uncomfortable, especially if you’re not wearing a mask,” Vasquez said.
Vasquez said she hasn’t seen Vex drivers enforcing the policy during rides, but hopes University staff enforce the mask mandate in all required settings including GW-operated transportation, where students are not socially distanced and gather in an enclosed space. Vex drivers are not employed by the University as contracted workers through RMA Worldwide Chauffeured Transportation.
The University’s campus health guidelines state students, faculty and staff are expected to “commit and adhere to required health and safety guidelines” established by GW policy and D.C. law but do not list any penalties for failing to wear a mask in required areas.
Vasquez said she’s comfortable remaining unmasked in open areas like the University Student Center, where masking is not required, because the open spaces are typically less crowded.
“In certain spaces it should be required, like the Vex, because it’s so many people so close together, but in open spaces, if you’re close to someone it’s typically because you’re friends with them,” she said of going unmasked.
Alexandra Kicior, a junior studying international affairs and a former Hatchet reporter, said she doesn’t consistently wear her mask on the Vex and makes her decision to wear one depending on how many people are seated near her and whether they are masked.
“Sometimes I’ll just go on and be like ‘Oh, there’s no one sitting around me. I don’t have to put it on’ or I don’t feel like I should,” Kicior said.
Kicior said she noticed the GW community shift into an eased attitude regarding COVID policy this semester in comparison to last year when cases were higher. She said her professors used to be stricter about enforcing the mask mandate in classes but have taken a more moderate approach this semester, choosing not to enforce the policy as many students opt to go maskless.
“Last year, they were enforcing the rules a lot more,” Kicior said. “And now it’s more relaxed.”
Rohan Bagli, a senior studying finance, said he remains maskless in some of his smaller classes with fewer than 50 students but continues to mask in larger lectures where he’s in close contact with more students. He said most of his professors haven’t actively enforced the mandate or even made statements about wearing masks in class.
“A lot of my classes have 20 to 30 kids in them, and there’s a lot of space between me and the other kids, so we don’t wear masks,” Bagli said. 
Bagli also said most students are tired of continuing to wear masks as COVID rates decrease on campus, and he thinks it’s an appropriate time for students to start pulling back on mask-wearing.
“I think a lot of us have mask fatigue,” Bagli said. “A lot of us are just a little bit tired of wearing them.”
Marianna Pecora, a freshman studying political communication, said she hasn’t seen any enforcement of the mask mandate on the Vex, which she hopes the University will do better to promote compliance with all University policies moving forward.
“If they’re going to keep a mandate in place, then there should be a more significant enforcement system,” Pecora said. “Because I think it sends a mixed message from administration to have a mandate but they’re not enforcing it.”
Grace Newman, a sophomore studying business analytics, said she only wears masks in the three classes where her professors enforce the mandate, but she chooses not to mask in her two classes where they are less strict. She said professors who regularly mention mask-wearing in class cause more students to wear them, but more students tend to go maskless if the professor doesn’t show interest in the issue.
“I feel like last year, everyone was more used to wearing them, and the teachers and professors enforced it more,” Newman said. “But after summer break and since we’ve been back, the students are less wanting to wear them, and the professors aren’t enforcing it as much. I feel like they’re also a little tired.”
Georgetown University scaled back its mask mandate last week, making masks optional in instructional spaces and in the library and dining halls, but requiring them in health care centers and on university shuttles and transportation. American University recommends masks in classrooms but only requires masking in on-campus medical facilities.

Whether in Martha’s Vineyard or D.C., cities and towns across the country have struggled to respond to an influx of migrants that Republican governors have sent as part of a foolish, cruel and inhumane attempt to protest President Joe Biden’s border control policy this summer. The United States has received record numbers of migrants in recent months, and busing these human beings to cities that were ill-prepared to handle such an influx has worsened their living situations. But unlike other cities, the structure of the District and its relationship to the federal government is making it harder to provide food, water, housing and legal aid to the thousands of people who have found themselves in a city that they may not have intended to enter.
Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of limited emergency in D.C. last month to address migrants’ basic needs. While the city created the Office of Migrant Services last month to aid asylum seekers with $10 million in contingency funds, it also looked to federal authorities for assistance – Bowser stressed that the city can’t address a national issue on its own while dealing with other issues, like homelessness. But with a steady increase in migrants and no guarantee of federal help, D.C. must organize its response to house, defend and support these migrants.
D.C.’s reliance on the federal government has hamstrung its ability to respond to this crisis. The Pentagon rejected Bowser’s request earlier this summer to deploy 150 members of the National Guard to help process migrants and refugees. While the National Guard is usually under the command of the state or territory governor, that’s not the case in D.C. – the president and Department of Defense assume the responsibility that Mayor Bowser would otherwise have. The condition of federal oversight listed above is just one example of how the District differs from other governments with statehood. Without voting representation in Congress, D.C. missed out on millions of dollars of federal COVID-19 relief in March 2020 because lawmakers grouped the city with U.S. territories rather than with states in the bill’s funding calculations.
Although the mayor’s office is just a stone’s throw from the White House and a short walk from Capitol Hill, federal officials are turning a blind eye to the migrant crisis D.C. is facing. Bowser has said that aiding and welcoming immigrants to D.C. is a top priority, but that priority needs money, staff and other resources to become reality. Denying Bowser’s requests for National Guard assistance and failing to reimburse the city for covering migrants’ needs ignores how much her administration is working to address this crisis and strains that response even further.
If D.C. can’t rely on federal funding to help address the issues migrants are facing, it’ll have to stretch every dollar to its limit and rely on local residents and organizations to assist in resettling incoming migrants. Nongovernmental and charitable organizations are a second line of defense to serve and support migrants and their families in ways the government can’t. Overworked and underfunded organizations like SAMU First Response provide migrants with food, water, shelter, legal consultations, translation services and more. While the Office of Migrant Services is theoretically doing the same, shifting funding from there to organizations that have experience and more established relationships with community members would be more effective.
D.C.’s lack of representation and resulting lack of funding have limited its ability to support migrants, leaving them without the resources they need to survive and thrive in the nation’s capital or at their final destination within the country. D.C. is, as the mayor’s declaration indicates, in a state of emergency. Migrants are human beings and deserve all the aid they require, whether it be legal assistance, a change of clothes or something to eat. Both the federal and local governments should be doing everything in their power to provide this assistance, especially considering that D.C. may not be every individual’s final destination in the U.S.
This is a crisis that requires immediate attention – the federal government should take seriously the call to action from Bowser and nongovernmental agencies alike. But barring federal intervention, D.C.’s residents will need to take action to defend their new neighbors whether they intend to make a new life here or are simply passing through. Migrant rights are human rights, and human rights belong to every individual regardless of where they might come from.

From the dark days of the University’s shuttered campus to the full return of in-person learning last semester, GW’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic through isolation housing, testing and masking has shifted over the past two years. But the University’s COVID policy is radically different from where it began. In the absence of official policy, students are riding out the pandemic on couches and spare mattresses while their roommates self-isolate, and immunocompromised students feel neglected on a campus that doesn’t enforce mask wearing or require testing. GW has abdicated its responsibility in favor of an individualistic approach that has left students to navigate a public health crisis on their own.
GW began rolling back its COVID policy this summer, transitioning to voluntary asymptomatic testing in July and instituting an “isolate in place” in August. And in September, officials announced that GW would go mask optional except for in instructional settings, health care facilities and on University transportation. These voluntary, self-contradictory and ill-informed policies have effectively left students without a coordinated plan from officials in charge of charting GW’s pandemic response and protecting their own health.
The University’s decision to put us, willingly or not, in charge of our own health couldn’t be clearer than with the end of isolation housing. Instead of sending students who test positive for COVID to another room in a residence hall or off-campus hotel, GW’s isolation-in-place policy has sent students with sick roommates scrambling to find a place to stay on their own. For those who can’t crash on a peer’s couch or afford to book an expensive hotel room on such short notice, GW recommends they simply stay as far apart from their roommates as possible. And if GW’s isolation guidance amounts to a nonchalant shrug, the reasoning behind the change is even more questionable – the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that GW publicly cites covers K-12 educational facilities, not colleges.
Maura Kelly-Yuoh | Staff Cartoonist
The advice GW does offer about masking is just as illogical as its reasoning behind isolation housing. N95 masks are the best way to protect ourselves and others, and yet they’re optional – but strongly recommended. GW’s recent mask optional policy isn’t without precedent, though usually not a successful one. The University lifted its mask mandate in June 2021 for vaccinated individuals but reimposed it a month later. And a similar story played out in April this year – officials ended the mask mandate in all settings except for health care facilities but put it back in place just more than a week later after an increase in cases. What reason is there to believe the University won’t flip-flop again?
And the transition to voluntary testing has made tracking COVID on campus all the more difficult. With fewer asymptomatic individuals testing, we don’t have an accurate picture of GW’s positivity rate – GW’s positivity rate was 0.2 percent compared to a citywide rate of roughly two percent in September 2021. Last month, GW’s positivity rate was nearly 5.5 percent – a nearly 27-fold increase – while D.C.’s positivity jumped by a smaller interval to about six percent.
There’s no doubt that students are split over the University’s guidance, nor is this the first time that a shift in GW’s COVID policies has led to a mix of celebration and consternation among students. But dialing back isolation housing, testing and masking jeopardizes your health and safety regardless of how you feel about these measures.
Granted, both the pandemic and the response to it have cost the University millions of dollars, losses that officials are surely looking to recoup as quickly as possible by winding down isolation housing and testing. Acting as if the pandemic were over or at least in an endemic phase may secure GW’s financial health, but reducing its efforts to track and limit the spread of COVID risks the community’s well-being.
We can’t get through this pandemic alone, but that’s the message students have received from officials this semester – everything is optional, voluntary or recommended. GW went from mustering its institutional strength to confront a life-changing disease at the start of the pandemic to offering mealy mouthed, contradictory and unfounded advice today. The pandemic isn’t over, no matter how much we, or the University’s balance sheet, want it to be.
So continue to wear a mask, test yourself for COVID and make contingency plans if you or your roommate needs to isolate. GW may be washing its hands of the pandemic, but each of us can keep ourselves and those around us healthy.
And even if GW is looking to cut costs, it should support students with the resources and guidance they need to be responsible for their own health – continue to supply voluntary lab testing and KN95 masks until or unless supplies run out. And with officials making their stance on isolation housing clear, haphazard responses and mediated discussions with community coordinators can only go so far. A list of students willing to take in people whose roommates are in isolation or a more formal guide to off-campus housing options would objectively be a better help to students.
At the outset of the pandemic, the University made a difficult decision to keep students safe. Now, it’s taking an easy decision that puts them in danger, letting its COVID response wither under the guise of personal responsibility and financial strain. Inaccurate, unhelpful information and misguided policies are no way to keep students safe – we’ll do our part, just as long as GW does its, too.

During my first week living in Thurston Hall, somebody put a fish in a communal shower. And as much as I enjoyed watching a student carry the fish barehanded down seven flights of stairs to solemnly present it to a very bewildered security guard, our custodial staff was likely much less amused to scrub remnants of dead fish goo off the shower floor at 10 p.m. The fish incident represented a larger issue that has continued throughout the semester – students aren’t treating our custodial staff with respect. Students have been making unnecessarily excessive messes in communal spaces, and they haven’t made an effort to get to know our staff on a more personal level despite the fact that we interact with them multiple times each day.
From leaving piles of food scraps and unwashed dishes in the shared kitchen sinks to leaving hair, human waste and fish in the communal bathrooms, students are making a mess of their residence halls and taking advantage of the fact that someone else will have to clean it. Thurston Hall’s community coordinators have already told residents via email to stop clogging the toilets with paper towels and clothes. This behavior has added yet another burden upon the building’s already busy custodial staff.
The custodial staff aren’t our personal maids or butlers – they have actual work to do, and their contributions to our community deserve appreciation. They’re responsible for disposing of food scraps or wiping up accidental spills, cleaning the bathrooms to make sure they’re sanitary and taking out our communal trash bins. They shouldn’t be responsible for getting clothes out of our toilets, and dealing with a dead fish in the showers wasn’t in their job description. Instead of mindlessly leaving huge messes in our wake, we can act more considerately to custodial staff.
One of the main reasons why I and other students likely chose to attend GW is the student body’s impressive commitment to social advocacy and equity. I view the University as one that prides itself on valuing and appreciating all members of the diverse identities among its staff and student body. So when I moved into Thurston Hall, I couldn’t help but feel there was a contrast between the values that students preached and the behavior that actually takes place on campus. Students seem to make little effort to get to know our custodial staff and often don’t acknowledge our custodians’ presence at all. I, too, can be hesitant to say hello when passing by staff in the hallway or on the elevator, and so I understand that many people simply find it awkward to interact with others whom they don’t know. But just because this subtle disregard is understandable doesn’t mean it’s acceptable.
When I was leaving Thurston last Friday, my friend asked a custodian visibly struggling to push an oversized garbage bin into the building if he needed help holding open the door. Although he declined, he seemed to deeply appreciate the fact she volunteered. “Thank you,” he said. “You’re the only person who asked.” He pointed out to us all the students who were walking by, none of whom had offered help with the door. “All these people, and you’re the only one who asked.”
It is essential for all members of the student body to make sure that we’re getting to know and actively supporting the custodial staff instead of scarcely acknowledging their existence. Custodians should not have to feel unseen while cleaning up after students who don’t feel the need to ever say hello, ask their names or take 10 seconds out of their day to hold a door for them. They should not have to feel like students are taking advantage of them with extravagant amounts of disarray left for staff to handle.
When I spoke to some of the women from our custodial staff, they expressed a genuine appreciation for the students who say hello and stop to chat, and she said these interactions can foster a family-like feeling.
We’re surrounded by an incredibly friendly and genuine staff that seeks to support the GW community. Our custodial staff exhibits a real compassion and kindness toward us, and we do ourselves a disservice when we overlook them in return. So say hello when you bump into them in the hallway or on the elevator. And the next time you’re about to leave your mess unattended, remember the humanity of those who have to clean it.

Student leaders registered the organization on campus over the summer and aim to host social events for students to engage in Lebanese culture this semester.
Students in the new Lebanese Student Association plan to raise awareness for ongoing issues in Lebanon and fundraise for charities to raise emergency aid this semester.
E-board members said they plan to build a tight-knit community for Lebanese students at GW and use social media to spread awareness and fundraise for conflicts in Lebanon. Student leaders founded the LSA last spring, registered as a student organization over the summer and aim to host social events for students to engage in Lebanese culture this semester.
More than 20 students attended LSA’s first general body meeting Tuesday, which included free falafel sandwiches and opportunities to suggest event ideas for the fall semester to board members. Student leaders said they plan on holding weekly fundraising events, including a sale of Lebanese food that would send half of the profits to charities for Lebanese communities facing poverty, like the Lebanese Red Cross and Social and Economic Action for Lebanon.
Sophomore Oliver Jabbour, the co-founder of the LSA, said members hope to screen Lebanese films with outside organizations like the Foreign Film Society, an organization on campus that shows foreign films to encourage conversation on world events.
“I think it’s going to be so great,” Jabbour said. “Just have a strong Lebanese presence on campus and outside of campus.”
Jabbour said the main goal of the new student organization is to bring people together across campus to promote Lebanese culture. He said the LSA previously disbanded, which made it more difficult to meet other Lebanese students. A Facebook page named GW Lebanese Student Association posted most recently in November 2018.
“I want a strong community with these people and to start doing things together instead of being alone,” Jabbour said. “We are unified by sharing some religions or sharing Arabic as a language.”
Sophomore Lara Eid, the co-president of the LSA, said the organization is planning to recruit students to join the club and help spread awareness about Lebanese culture through public fundraising events and other promotional events like tabling in Kogan Plaza.
“I think a big Lebanese thing is socializing and everybody knows everybody somehow through someone,” Eid said.
Eid said the members hope to build an inclusive community not just for Lebanese people, but for anyone on campus to help and participate.
“I want everybody, not even just Lebanese people, to be a part of it and just feel like they’re here and they are able to participate, not like they are excluded or like they’re not welcome,” Eid said. “I want everybody to feel like they can really engage and embrace our culture.”
Junior Katarina Hamady, the LSA’s director of public relations, said members want to dedicate a portion of each club meeting to discuss current events in Lebanon. She said she wants to create educational posts for the club’s social media to raise awareness for issues in Lebanon, like the current economic crisis and the 2020 Beirut explosion. 
In August 2020, 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in the Port of Beirut, killing more than 200 people. Last August, thousands of protesters led demonstrations in Beirut urging the Lebanese government to further investigate the explosion that left more than 300,000 people displaced.
Hamady said members plan to use the organization’s Instagram account, which currently has more than 70 followers, to recruit students. She said LSA plans on being “as active as possible” this semester with sales of Lebanese food in Kogan Plaza.
“We’re definitely not hesitant in sharing our love for our culture and also educating people on all the things that are going on right now and how you can help,” she said.
Junior Eyad Sleem, the LSA’s director of cultural integrity, said his role is to make sure the club “exemplifies the culture of the Lebanese identity” and no religion is “discriminated” against on campus, considering there are 18 recognized religions in Lebanon. 
Sleem said GW needed the Lebanese Student Association due to the high number of Lebanese students on campus. He joined the organization wanting to create a community where students can talk to each other and share in their culture.
Sleem and other members said they hope to collaborate on student programming with other organizations across campus, like the Arab Student Association and Middle Eastern Society. He said the LSA could organize a joint Brazilian and Lebanese barbecue with the Brazilian Student Association along with other bonding events for all students.
“As a board member, I would say my responsibilities would be to ensure that this club is successful in its mission of bringing Lebanese kids together and forming a good community,” Sleem said. “There’s a lot of freshmen on campus and I noticed a lot of exchange students as well that we could try to bring in.”
Sophomore and LSA member Maya Sabeh said she was excited about having an organization where Lebanese students can bond and get to know each other.
“I am half Lebanese and I’ve lived in the U.S. for most of my life, but I want to get more connected to my culture and my Lebanese side,” Sabeh said.

Cheh said she decided to step down to spend more time with her family, especially her granddaughter, and making sure her family was safe during the pandemic realigned some of her priorities.
After representing Ward 3 on the D.C. Council for 16 years with a proven record pushing for policy on the environment, nutrition and transportation while teaching at GW Law, Council member Mary Cheh’s lawmaking career is coming to an end.
Cheh will end her tenure representing Ward 3 – the upper northwest quadrant of the city that encompasses some of the District’s wealthiest neighborhoods – in January after she withdrew from the upcoming ballot in February to spend more time with family. She has taught constitutional law and criminal procedure at GW for more than 40 years and is one of the only current Council members to have held an outside job while serving on the Council.
“Once I got there, and I realized the potential for making things better in various spheres, whether it be health or consumer protection or what have you, I said, ‘Wow, I can really accomplish things here and make things better,’” Cheh said.
Here’s a look back at her Council career:
New to local government, Cheh secured Ward 3 seat in 2006
Cheh said she decided to run for the Ward 3 seat in the 2006 election when former Council member Kathy Patterson – whose daughter was on the youth soccer team Cheh coached – ran for chair of the D.C. Council, leaving the Ward 3 spot open for a fresh face. Despite calling herself “completely ignorant” to the power of local politics prior to the election, Cheh said her legal conversations with Patterson made her realize she could accomplish her legal and environmental goals on the Council.
“It planted a seed in my mind, and I started to say, ‘Well, maybe that could be exciting or good,’” Cheh said.
Cheh won the 2006 Democratic nomination with a little less than half of the vote against eight opponents. She said she had no campaign organization or experience going into the general election, where she beat Republican candidate Theresa Conroy for the seat with more than 70 percent of the vote and promised to continue teaching at GW despite her new career.
Cheh said because candidates for the Council aren’t advertised on TV and radio, she could prioritize her campaign spending on retail, like flyers and yard signs. She said she also threw house parties where she networked with city officials throughout the campaign.
“To this day, I can think of little aspects of it that may have contributed to it, but in terms of an actual strategy, I would hardly call what I did strategic or well planned or anything like that,” Cheh said. “But in any case, I won.”
Cheh said while Congress interfered with Council legislation regarding hot-button issues like marijuana legalization or taxpayer-funded needle exchange programs in the past, she was impressed by the Council’s speed passing bills and budgets during her tenure. She said the city government has home rule – a dependent government’s right to rule itself – and Congress doesn’t usually interfere with legislation, despite acting as D.C.’s legislature under Article One of the U.S. Constitution.
“We have a $17 billion dollar budget and yet this streamlined legislative process,” Cheh said. “It’s amazing, so I have taken full advantage of that to pass major pieces of legislation, sometimes landmark pieces of legislation.”
Clean energy, nutrition legislation headline Cheh’s accomplishments 
Cheh said one of the first omnibus bills – which packages together many measures into one piece of legislation – that she introduced and passed was the Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008, which authorized the city to contract private companies who administered sustainable energy programs in the city. She said she was always looking for opportunities to save energy as a Council member, and passing her legislation has made D.C. a “leader” in the nation for green energy.
She said despite facing pressure to support climate measures like a carbon tax from outside groups, she identified regulating buildings’ energy as one of her environmental priorities from the start of her tenure because D.C. uses most of its energy on powering buildings and lacks polluting industries, like fossil fuel production and logging. D.C. uses about 85 percent of its energy in the commercial and residential sector and about 15 percent in transportation and industry, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
“The key is buildings, so I put in that legislation,” Cheh said. “Then finally, the different groups – the climate action groups and this and that – they all come around and think, ‘Wow, what a genius you are’, and I said ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t have been if you had your way about it.’”
Cheh wrote and passed an amendment to the act in 2018, mandating the city to convert to entirely renewable energy by 2032.
She spearheaded numerous other bills during her tenure, like the 2008 Healthy Schools Act – which created standards for school meal quality like mandatory vegetarian options, provided universal free breakfast for public school students and increased student physical activity requirements at D.C. schools. She likened her efforts to introduce a one percent soda tax per ounce of sugary beverage in 2010 – which failed by one vote – to “going to war.”
“We have to counter that and not wait for people to get into a position where they have heart problems or hypertension,” Cheh said. “But if they are, we have to think of food as better than drugs in many cases, as medicine.”
The Council voted Cheh as chair of the Committee of Transportation, Environment and Public Works in 2011, and she also chaired the committee that investigated former Ward 2 Council member Jack Evans, who resigned in 2020 in light of a series of ethics violations.
Cheh to focus on teaching at GW and family
Cheh said in February that she would not run for a fifth term on the Council despite already filing to appear on the ballot, a reversal that surprised some locals. But she said the decision to step down was the fruition of juggling her jobs on the Council and at GW, where she taught morning and night classes to leave room for Council events during the day.
“Having two full-time jobs for 16 years has been pretty grueling,” Cheh said. “And there are some Council members who just serve on the Council, and they just want to be Council members. They don’t really do very much, but I’ve been very active and it’s been a challenge.”
Cheh said she decided to step down to spend more time with her family, especially her granddaughter, and making sure her family was safe during the pandemic realigned some of her priorities.
“My kids were telling me, ‘Don’t do it, you’ve done enough, don’t do it for another four more years,’ and they did influence me and my friends,” Cheh said. “So what was not seen behind the scenes is this debate in my mind, and my leaning against running.”
Cheh said she will continue teaching law at GW for the foreseeable future, but she hopes to take up visiting professorships at another law school in the future to “revive her juices.” She said she hopes to create a food law and policy course at GW after passing legislation expanding animal welfare protections on the Council because of the “amorphous” nature of animal law.
She said she will miss the position in D.C. government after serving for 16 years, but with an accomplished track record, Cheh is ready to sign off on her lawmaking career.
“Both things can be true,” Cheh said. “I can miss it, but I won’t be leaving with regrets.”
Ward 2 D.C. Council member Brooke Pinto – who represents neighborhoods including Foggy Bottom, West End and Georgetown – said it has been a pleasure serving on the Council with Cheh since she was elected in 2020, and Cheh is a “champion” of environmental and sustainability issues. She said she will miss working with Cheh because of her thoughtful and logical legislative style.
“Throughout her time on the Council, she has been the driving force on accelerating our climate goals and ensuring that all residents have access to renewable energy, clean drinking water and environmentally sustainable jobs,” Pinto said in an email.

Rowland wants to encourage Hispanic athletes to “ignore the statistics” if they are interested in rowing and looking to pursue their dreams in a sport that fails to represent athletes of color.
Updated: Oct. 5, 2022 at 6:29 p.m.
As the only international athlete from Latin America on the women’s rowing team, competing in a sport all but void of diversity is nothing new for senior rower Elizabeth Rowland.
Rowland, who identifies as half Colombian, started her college career at Hobart and William Smith College in Geneva, New York – a predominantly white institution that left her without a sense of inclusion or understanding in the classroom and on the water. But after transferring to GW during her sophomore year and discovering a more diverse community of Hispanic students and locals, Rowland said she has settled in as a team leader and a role model for Hispanic student-athletes looking to brave the same sport while holding onto their core cultural identity.
“I felt a lot like it was a very small, similar community of people who I didn’t feel very included and I didn’t feel very understood by from a cultural perspective,” Rowland said in an interview. “I really wanted to change to get the Division 1 experience, just because I felt like rowing at the Division 3 level wasn’t really meeting the expectations I have for myself, and my goals didn’t feel very supported.”

Seventy-three percent of women’s rowing athletes identify as white at the NCAA level, leaving Hispanic athletes in the five percent minority.

Rowland said she savors the chance to compete at the collegiate level and hopes to inspire other students in the Hispanic community to feel empowered to do the same, especially in sports where people of color are less represented. During Hispanic Heritage Month, The GW Hatchet is profiling Hispanic athletes at GW to showcase their talent and spotlight the faces behind the stat lines.
Rowland wants to encourage Hispanic athletes to ignore the statistics if they are interested in rowing and looking to pursue their dreams in a sport that often fails to represent athletes of color. She said she wants the sport to become more accessible to the community, especially at the collegiate level, where most rowing programs recruit students without previous experience.
Before she launched into her rowing career, Rowland moved homes often throughout her younger years with her family because of her father’s work for the State Department. She said most of his posts were in Latin America in countries like Venezuela, where Rowland grew up in a “decently homogenous culture” that made her feel like she was still in Colombia.
She said she misses speaking Spanish in her everyday life, but she practices her native language during regular phone calls with her mom and listens to Hispanic music during her workouts to remind herself of home.
Rowland said one of her favorite Colombian dishes is Bandeja Paisa, traditional of the Antioquia region that has two types of Colombian sausage, ground beef, rice, red beans, fried pork rind, an arepa, a plantain, a slice of avocado and a fried egg on top. She said restaurants like Arepa Zone at Western Market help satisfy any cravings for Colombian food.
“I think Arepa Zone at Western Market does a pretty good job, I think that it’s their label of a Venezuelan restaurant,” Rowland said. “I think Venezuela and Colombia, just having historically been one country, have a lot of similarities with this is. And so it just basically feels like I’m having Colombian dishes when I go there.”
Rowland began rowing competitively in high school in Massachusetts, where she finished sixth in the single event at the Head of the Quinobequin, a 3K race on the Charles River in Boston. She also won the Head of the Riverfront, a national rowing regatta in Connecticut, in 2018.
The varsity eight boat, a three-seat race, has been a constant throughout her career at GW, where she placed second at the A-10 Championship during her sophomore year while also helping the Colonials place second overall, matching the program’s best finish. Last season, Rowland gained a spot on the All-Conference Second Team and rowed GW to a silver medal in the varsity eight boat at the A-10 Championship while once again recording a second-place finish for the program.
Rowland said she looks to continue getting faster and making the varsity eight boat as the team looks to clinch first place in the Atlantic 10 Championship for the first time in program history.
She said the team had a “pretty exciting” season outperforming pre-season rankings and rebounding from a few early losses. Rowland said although the team first struggled to iron out its physical chemistry, the Colonials’ scores on the ergometer – a device that measures physical strength and energy in the rowing motion – indicated that their physical condition positioned them to execute on the water.
Rowland said she hopes the team will take advantage of their past performance to acquire the crown.
“A team goal would be to win A-10 this year, just because we’ve come in second so many times,” Rowland said. “We keep closing that margin. It just keeps getting smaller and smaller, so hopefully this year we can flip it.”
Rowland said her Hispanic identity has shaped the smallest habits of her rowing career, including her workout music that includes popular Spanish songs, and her transition to a new country to pursue her education and athletics has allowed her to challenge herself in recent years.
“I think I kind of took a moment to be thankful for the opportunity to be a student-athlete, and I hope when people see that I am one, especially in the Hispanic community, it helps them feel empowered,” Rowland said. “Just because I feel like there’s strength in numbers, and being able to see someone doing something that you could potentially do I think is empowering – to be ‘I can do that’ versus ‘Who’s filling that space for you?’”

This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Rowland is the only international athlete on the women’s rowing team. She is the only international athlete from Latin America on the team. The Hatchet incorrectly reported that 75 percent of of women’s rowing athletes in the NCAA identify as white. The correct number is 73 percent. The Hatchet also incorrectly reported that the Colonials tied Duquesne in preseason polling. That ranking did not apply to NCAA polls for women’s rowing. We regret these errors. This post was also updated to clarify the meaning of an ergometer.

Marchers blocked the intersection of 21st and H streets for about three hours Friday.
Updated: Monday, Oct. 4 at 12:56 p.m.
Dozens of Sunrise GW protesters staged a mock funeral and blocked the intersection of H and 21st streets Friday as their first action of the semester to urge officials to reject fossil fuel research funding from companies like ExxonMobil and the Koch foundations. 
Protesters dressed in black marched through campus while carrying a fake casket marked “Our Futures” Friday afternoon in an effort to establish a tone of “mourning” to mobilize students to fight against climate change. Sunrise GW leaders said they want to see increased transparency from University officials in regards to GW’s 2020 promise to divest the University’s endowment from fossil fuel industry companies by 2025.
Bella Kumar, a sophomore and a hub coordinator for Sunrise GW, said Friday’s somber theme was a departure from Sunrise’s previous protest in April when the organization led a “celebratory” march through campus that culminated with the organization’s pleas to administrators to reject funding from fossil fuel companies.
She said Sunrise GW hopes to build on the energy sparked by the protest to organize students to take action during the upcoming semester by asking professors to take a pledge and sign a petition to reject fossil fuel funding. She said the pledge, which launched last November, has gained more than 60 signees from programs like the Redstone Center and the Women’s, Gender & Sexuality Studies Program, and the petition has gained more than 1,400 signees. 
“What we can control is the funding our University takes and the social license of the fossil fuel industry,” Kumar said. “It’s imperative for us to cut that tie.”
Kumar said she hopes students recognize the urgency behind the University’s role in the climate crisis following the protest and feel motivated to pressure officials to refuse fossil fuel funding and offer funding transparency.
“I hope people understand that we are going to die,” Kumar said. “And that it becomes a prominent issue for them and that they take control over what we have control over.”
Protesters marched from Kogan Plaza to the F Street House of Interim University President Mark Wrighton, where Sunrise hub coordinators and members urged administrators to sever ties with fossil fuel companies.
Marchers then shifted to the intersection of H and 21st streets, where they sat for about three hours playing live music, pasting sticky notes detailing future hopes and dreams onto a makeshift casket and delivering speeches to denounce GW’s Regulatory Studies Center, which accepted more than $1 million from ExxonMobil and the Koch network, according to a 2019 report.
Metropolitan Police Department and GW Police Department officers blocked traffic to the intersection, turning around vehicles when they approached the group.
Mary McManus, a sophomore and a member of Sunrise GW, said they left a note on the wooden casket lying at the center of the intersection detailing their hopes to one day have a family, a career and an advanced degree – goals they said are at risk if the climate change crisis isn’t immediately and thoroughly addressed.
“Everything my parents got to have will be dead and gone if we don’t do something about the climate crisis now, do something about it yesterday,” McManus said. 
McManus said they hope GW follows Princeton University’s recent example in refusing research funding from fossil fuel companies after Princeton officials announced last week that they would dissociate from ExxonMobil, NRG Energy and 88 other corporations active in the fossil fuel industry. 
“We’ve already achieved divestment, so I feel like GW could be one of the leaders in this movement,” McManus said. “I do have faith.”
Student Association President Christian Zidouemba attended Friday’s protest in solidarity with Sunrise GW and said his mission as SA president is to support any student organization in achieving their goals and making an impact on campus. He said he hopes the Board of Trustees and other officials will support the student body’s call for climate action by divesting money from fossil fuel companies, but noted the process would likely take years before seeing the benefits. 
“When you have people demanding things and wanting a change, I think we have an opportunity when we bring a new president on campus to make our University a global hub for climate change,” Zidouemba said. “So hopefully, we can do that.”
