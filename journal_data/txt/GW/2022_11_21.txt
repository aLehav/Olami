GW’s nine general education requirements cover a vast array of courses that help train students in a variety of analytical disciplines. But these classes are useless for students who’ve already declared their major. I chose to attend GW because I was excited to partake in the incredibly uncommon creative writing and English degree program, a combination that’s hard to find at many universities. My major is only 33 credits, but I still have to slog through an additional 26 credits in math, science, social science and oral communication courses as part of general education requirements.
These 26 credits realistically equate to at least two semesters of coursework, burdening students with hours of coursework that don’t relate to their field of study. Despite the necessary foundation for writing and conversational skills that general education requirements provide, GW should eliminate the courses that individual schools already require to relieve students from coursework that bears little-to-no relationship to their major.
GW has a 24-credit cap on the number of AP and IB credits from high school that students can apply to their education. These high school credits can fulfill the University’s critical thinking, math, science, writing and oral communication requirements. But whether or not they have AP and IB credits, many students will need to retake courses to graduate from GW. Each category of GW’s requirements has a list of classes that will fulfill the requirement, but some are downright paradoxical – there are foreign language courses that don’t fulfill the oral communication credit and introductory classes that feel as difficult as capstone courses. Several semesters of general education requirements rob students of the time to take electives, pick up a minor, double major or learn a new language.
Mandatory math, science, social science and oral communication courses are often unrelated to students’ actual majors and fail to both further students’ skills and set them up for their career goals. And despite all the options to fulfill these requirements, it’s been challenging for me to find a course that I’m passionate about. 
To succeed in introductory science courses or those that are designed with non-STEM students in mind, like Understanding Organisms through Service Learning, students realistically need to have a background on the subject. Instead of a quick and easy class to fill a requirement, these courses can become a grueling academic experience. I’m currently enrolled in an environmental geology course, using my time to look at rocks and landforms when I could be focusing on and mastering my creative writing skills.
Additional school-specific requirements demonstrate the redundant nature of the University’s overarching general education requirements. The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences – which houses my writing and English program – requires students to take six additional courses in critical thinking, scientific reasoning and creative thinking, global or cross-cultural perspectives and local or civic engagement, according to the CCAS academic advising website. Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, School of Business and Elliott School of International Affairs must take a required science, social science and humanities course from the University’s general education requirements. But how many courses must students take before they can actually focus on their major? On top of those 26 general education requirements within CCAS, I have to take an additional 19 GPAC credits to graduate. Together, those 45 credits represent around three full semesters of mandatory, nonmajor requirements – nearly half of my time at GW.
Forcing students to take classes that are largely unrelated to their major can jeopardize their college success, future, ability to stay on good academic standing and mental health. Though all GW’s fields of study have their own set of challenges, intro-level requirements that add little to a student’s overall education should not risk them losing their scholarships or high-level post-graduate jobs if they risk getting academic probation.
Students only have four years at GW, and I’m dreading wasting my time with another semester of required lab science, social science, history and civic engagement classes next spring. Attending lectures on top of studying and taking exams for the sake of an A in a class that has nothing to do with my major is extremely disheartening. I’d rather study something I’m passionate about, and I’m sure other students would too. For the amount of money each student pays to attend GW, it’s disheartening to realize that you’re paying in time and money for courses that are not beneficial to your major and career aspirations.
GW should eliminate its social science, science, history and writing in the disciplines requirements, which school-specific requirements already cover, so students can have the chance to take another class in their major or an elective of interest. If the University removed its additional requirements, students could make the most of their college experience before entering the real world.

Sandy Hook, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Robb and countless others – for as long as the members of this editorial board have been alive, school shootings have cast a shadow over our education. And now, this violence has continued into our college years. Last Sunday, a student allegedly killed three and injured two other students at the University of Virginia as they returned from a field trip. 
Our heart goes out to the family and friends of Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis, D’Sean Perry and everyone this terrible tragedy has affected. It has been impossible to grieve their deaths without looking to GW. Every school shooting, especially one so close to home and in which a student is a suspect, births ghastly “what-ifs” – could we be next? 
In the aftermath of this incident – and after every school shooting – we’ve looked around to find the nearest entrances and exits of the places we frequent on campus, mapped escape routes from labyrinthian academic buildings and wondered whether the classroom door is strong enough to hold back an intruder. We are genuinely afraid to lose our lives and the people we love to similar acts of gun violence on GW’s campus.
The constant drumbeat of mass shootings has scarred an entire generation, and it truly feels as though there’s never a reprieve – a high school in Tenleytown went into lockdown Friday after reports of gunfire in the area. In August, a 15-year-old student shot and wounded two classmates at a school in Deanwood. And in April, a man wounded four people at a school in Van Ness, leading to a lockdown and search for the suspect. Between these incidents and the cycle of media coverage and political debate they generate, young people in the United States don’t know a time before “active shooter drills” and politicians’ ham-fisted offers of “thoughts and prayers” became routine. 
From elementary to middle to high school and now to college, we are the first generation for whom these tragedies have become commonplace. We wore ribbons in 2012 after 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Since then, there have been 948 school shootings in the United States. In 2018, we organized walkouts and held vigils in memory of the 17 students and teachers killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. And after 19 children and two adults were killed this May at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, we demanded that our members of Congress finally do something about this scourge of violence.
And while we may have avoided the physical scars of gun violence, no one should feel that their classroom here at GW could become a crime scene. From walking back to their residence halls at night to simply sitting in class, students shouldn’t have to worry they’re in imminent danger at the hands of someone using a firearm.
GW and other universities may not be able to stop shootings before they start, but there are steps it can and should take to limit the harm they can create. GW offers discussion-based active shooter training to students, staff and faculty to prepare them to respond to a shooting, which is less traumatic than hyperrealistic scenarios, but this training does require a minimum of five participants and five days’ notice. Although instituting campus-wide drills would surely pose logistical and ethical challenges of its own, officials must ensure that more members of the University community know what to do if a shooting occurs. Stop the Bleed programs organized by local organizations and hospitals teach trainees to control bleeding by applying pressure to a wound, packing it with gauze and applying a tourniquet after a traumatic injury. Stocking buildings with kits that contain tourniquets, bandages and other medical equipment and training the GW community to use them would allow the University to place the proper precautions and safety measures in place. 
GW should certainly invest in tangible solutions to gun violence, but our anxiety about mass shootings as young people will never go away. From the killing of 15 students at the University of Texas at Austin in 1966 to UVA last week, more than 90 people have died learning, teaching and working at universities in this country – 64 of those deaths occurred just between 2007 and 2015. 
The members of the editorial board are personally horrified, shocked and frustrated by what happened at UVA and what has been happening across the country for decades now. We have friends and family who attend UVA. One of us has a parent who works minutes away from Sandy Hook, where the scars of tragedy still run deep. And another has a parent who is the assistant principal of an elementary school, where news of each school shooting sets off a pang of anguish. Our “what-ifs” aren’t empty hypotheticals. All of us have something at stake if, or when, the next school shooting happens. And statistically speaking, there will be a next one as we wait for a cycle of grief, sorrow and worry to set in motion yet again.  
We know that it will take much more than active shooter training and trauma kits to stop gun violence. To that end, The Hatchet has published an array of pieces calling on public officials to take action against what feels like the defining issue of our time. As politicians vow to do something about school shootings in the face of public pressure, we also want to acknowledge that it’s okay to feel afraid, angry or just numb – we certainly do.
The editorial board consists of Hatchet staff members and operates separately from the newsroom. This week’s staff editorial was written by Opinions Editor Ethan Benn and Contributing Opinions Editor Riley Goodfellow, based on discussions with Research Assistant Zachary Bestwick, Sports Editor Nuria Diaz, Copy Editor Jaden DiMauro, Culture Editor Clara Duhon, Contributing Culture Editor Julia Koscelnik and Contributing Social Media Director Ethan Valliath.

Protesters passed the time by giving speeches about the RSC’s ties to the fossil fuel industry on a Facebook livestream, eating snacks, playing cards and playing live music on instruments.
Sunrise GW protesters staged a 12-hour sit-in at the Regulatory Studies Center last Monday to protest the RSC’s 12 years of operations and call on RSC officials to cut ties with the fossil fuel industry.
Nine protesters occupied an RSC suite – a GW academic center researching regulatory policy located on the sixth floor of the Media and Public Affairs building and a common target of Sunrise criticism – from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. demanding a ban on fossil fuel funding accepted by the RSC. The protest is Sunrise’s most recent action targeting the RSC’s ties to the fossil fuel industry, following a mock funeral blocking the intersection of 21st and H streets in October outside of the RSC offices and protesters disrupting an RSC anniversary event in 2020.
Senior Jake Lowe, a member of Sunrise and a coordinator of the international coalition Fossil Free Research, said Monday’s protest was a part of Fossil Free Research’s Days of Action in which students across the U.S., U.K. and Canada took part in protests to demand a ban on fossil fuel research money accepted by their own institutions and universities.
Lowe said Sunrise has been leading its campaign calling on the RSC to reject funding from fossil fuel industry institutions like ExxonMobil and the Charles Koch Foundation for about two years. He said money the RSC accepts from fossil fuel industry corporations causes bias in the center’s research, ultimately providing studies that favor its benefactors.
“When you look at the research they actually produce, it’s very clear that they’re acting on account of their funders to promote climate disinformation and deregulation, and that’s just not something that we think GW should facilitate,” Lowe said. “We don’t think GW’s name should go on that kind of work, and it makes us ashamed to go to school here.”
Lowe said he wrote and released a report on the RSC about a year ago with nationwide climate campaign UnKoch My Campus, which stated that the RSC receives funding from actors with histories of climate disinformation and obstruction of climate action.
Watchdog organization Public Citizen accused the RSC in 2019 of political bias and promoting an anti-regulatory political agenda in its research. The report stated key funders like the Charles Koch Foundation and ExxonMobil donated more than $1 million to the center.
“We won’t stop campaigning against the Regulatory Studies Center until they reject funding from the fossil fuel industry and allied interests,” Lowe said.
In the first hours of the sit-in, RSC and Students Rights & Responsibilities staff as well as GW Police Department officers asked protesters to avoid causing a disturbance for workers remaining in the office space and asked them not to block office exits within the suite.
GWPD officers initially told Sunrise protesters that they wouldn’t be permitted to stay in the RSC office space past 10 p.m. when the building closes to the public, but officers eventually agreed to allow Sunrise to occupy the area up until their 12-hour marker at 11 p.m. as long as they remained peaceful. Protesters passed the time by giving speeches about the RSC’s ties to the fossil fuel industry on a Facebook livestream, eating snacks, playing cards and playing live music on instruments.
Joe Cordes, the co-director of the RSC, said while RSC officials understand students’ passion for climate justice, they recognize Sunrise’s protests as a violation of GW’s policies regarding academic freedom. He said he believes protesters were “mistaken” in their criticisms of the RSC Monday, citing a 2021 statement on the RSC’s mission and a 2020 RSC fact sheet providing details on the sources of the center’s funding.
“They violated the student code which prohibits actions that are ‘disruptive of normal University functions [or that] encompass the physical takeover or occupation of university facilities and spaces, whether or not they are in use at that time,’” Cordes said in an email. “We learn from respectful discourse, not threats, disruption and intimidation.”
Sophomore Keigan McCullagh, Sunrise’s communications director, said the group talked to Students Rights and Responsibilities staff during the sit-in about the possibility of disciplinary action following the protest, but they said it’s unclear what repercussions Sunrise protesters may face until the group meets with SRR officials about the case. They said despite possible disciplinary action, Sunrise doesn’t intend to put its campaign on hold for a semester because of possible probation.
“That was a cost-benefit analysis that we considered before we decided to do this,” McCullagh said. “So we’re just going to have to deal with that.”
McCullagh said the police presence decreased as the sit-in went on as GWPD officers recognized that the protest would remain peaceful for its 12-hour duration. They said the five officers who were initially present in the first few hours of the action ultimately decreased to one officer as the sit-in stretched later into the night.
“Once they realized that everyone had managed to find a different place to work and that we were not escalating beyond the level we were at, they just decided that they were going to let us do what we came here to do,” they said.
Junior Aza Evans-Townsend, a member of Sunrise’s war room committee responsible for overseeing Sunrise’s campaigns and actions, said Sunrise has had past interactions with the RSC like taping posters to the officials’ doors – which protesters were later fined for – and disrupting a RSC anniversary event in 2020. She said the nine protesters staging Monday’s sit-in were prepared for the possibility of being arrested.
“The RSC will likely be frustrated and likely want us to be punished, but it’s going to be dependent on how GWPD responds to their requests for us to be treated,” Evans-Townsend said.
They said prior to the action, the student group consulted with its lawyer, who confirmed the sit-in could be considered “unlawful entry” since the RSC offices are private property, increasing the risk of arrest “drastically” from past actions performed by Sunrise.
“I think a sit-in is important because we’re not being heard, specifically by this office and this institution,” Evans-Townsend said.
Evans-Townsend said she hopes the RSC is able to recognize the “conflict of interest” created by officials accepting fossil fuel money, but said she doesn’t expect them to cut ties with the fossil fuel industry as a direct result of the sit-in. They said they hope the RSC is able to publicly recognize the origins of its funding to be transparent with the GW community following the action.
“I think it’s important to acknowledge that funding transparency is not something we have at George Washington University,” she said. “All of the money that we have found from the fossil fuel industry that goes to the Regulatory Studies Center office has been through our own research and through looking at tax records.”

Last year, the ABA allowed law schools to accept the Graduate Record Examination instead of the LSAT.
An American Bar Association panel voted to drop the requirement that law school applicants take the Law School Admissions Test and other standardized tests Friday.
The panel voted 15-1 to remove the requirement that law school applicants submit students’ standardized test results like the commonly used LSAT and Graduate Record Examinations in their applications. If implemented, individual law schools could decide whether or not they keep the testing requirement, which could go into place in the fall 2025.
The ABA’s House of Delegates now must vote to codify the dropped requirement, but the body vetoed a similar rule change in 2018.
“In the grand scheme of things, folks of color perform less well on the LSAT than not, and for that reason, I think we are headed in the right direction,” Leo Martinez, an ABA council member and dean emeritus at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, said at the meeting. “I am sympathetic that it gives people like me a chance.”
GW Law currently requires an LSAT, GRE or GMAT scores from applicants. GW launched a free LSAT preparation program in June 2021.
Last year, the ABA allowed law schools to accept the Graduate Record Examination instead of the LSAT.
ABA member and dean of Syracuse University College of Law, said arguments that testing requirements are “necessary to save diversity in legal education” are “bizarre.”
Yale and Harvard law schools announced Wednesday that they were withdrawing from the U.S. News and World Report rankings because the methodology did not acknowledge schools’ efforts to recruit and support poor and working-class students.
Officials are yet to announce if GW Law will join other law schools in recusing themselves from the national rankings.
Heather Gerken, dean of Yale Law School, said in a statement the rankings are “profoundly flawed.” She said the rankings exclude loan forgiveness for public interest law programs, which Yale specializes in.
“We have reached a point where the rankings process is undermining the core commitments of the legal profession,” she said. “As a result, we will no longer participate.”
Gerken said the ranking system has made it difficult for law schools to support students with financial need. She said the rankings system is “counterproductive” to Yale’s mission.
“The people most harmed by this ill-conceived system are applicants who aspire to public service work and those from low-income backgrounds,” she said. “They’re trying to make a sensible choice about their future, and law schools want to do right by them.”
John Manning, dean of Harvard Law School, said in his statement U.S. News and World Report’s emphasis on test scores encourages law schools to prioritize merit-based aid over need-based aid.
“For these and other reasons, we will no longer participate in the U.S. News process,” he said. “It does not advance the best ideals of legal education or the profession we serve, and it contradicts the deeply held commitments of Harvard Law School.”
Stanford, Georgetown, Columbia and Berkeley law schools have all followed this move and withdrawn from the rankings. GW Law is currently tied at No. 25 with the Universities of Alabama and Notre Dame in the U.S. News and World Report rankings.

The baseball program began its affiliation with the project 25 years ago when then Head Coach Tom Walter agreed to host a commemorative home game for Jackie Robinson.
Updated: Nov. 23, 2022 at 11:06 a.m.
The 27th annual Jackie Robinson night paid tribute to the efforts of the GW baseball program’s efforts to commemorate Jackie Robinson’s memory Thursday night.
The baseball program began its affiliation with the project 25 years ago when then Head Coach Tom Walter agreed to host a commemorative home game for Jackie Robinson. The Jackie and Rachel Robinson Society honored the baseball program with the Jackie and Rachel Robinson Society Community Recognition Award and expressed gratitude toward Head Coach Greg Ritchie for his lifetime commitment.
Ritchie picked junior shortstop Steve DiTomasso to receive the award as part of an annual tradition to select an athlete who represents the baseball program with qualities that best reflect those associated with Jackie Robinson on and off the field.
“It’s a long standing commitment to understanding what Jackie Robinson and Rachel have done for the world and the amount of change that happened because of their courage to step forward and say things and do things, and to show the actions of what it means to have justice in social justice,” Ritchie said in an interview after the award show.
The program, created in 1996, leads events that focus on Jackie Robinson’s impact on baseball and the civil rights movement. Associate Professor of Sociology and Director of the Jackie Robinson Project Dr. Richard Zamoff hosts lectures about Robinson at schools across the country.
In 2018, University officials announced plans to terminate the then-22-year-old project citing financial strains, but it has since persisted after receiving widespread discouragement against the move, including a student petition that garnered hundreds of signatures.
Zamoff said sweeping issues of discrimination and human rights abuses that face the United States today speak to Robinson’s assertion that even his own legacy left “much more work still to be done.” He identified a series of modern issues that Robinson would work against, like book bans, abortion restrictions and widespread racial discrimination, citing the first World Series without an African American player born in the United States since 1950.
“We cannot pretend, nor should wait, that those years did not occur, nor should we delude ourselves that those challenges have disappeared, there are decision-makers at GW who simply do not value what we do,” Zamoff said.
Zamoff said the baseball program has been a great resource for society as it has allowed them to institutionalize Jackie Robinson’s legacy with the annual game and award show as a celebration for the entire GW community. He said during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project was unable to host any events, but the baseball program proved to be “a valuable liaison” to connect the project to the student community.
Zamoff relayed messages praising the project from a series of GW community members who could not attend, including former baseball Head Coach Tom Walter, Karen Ercole, who managed academic support services for GW Athletics, and Stephen Butler, a senior staff member of the project.
“I want to thank you, the Jackie Robinson project staff and the students in the Jackie and Rachel Robinson society, for getting off the sidelines and honoring Jackie’s life and legacy in such a meaningful way on the GW campus,” Zamoff read from Walter’s remarks.
Zamoff then presented the Jackie Robinson Direct Appreciation Award to the baseball program while honoring Head Coach Ritchie for his commitment to continuing the relationship with the Jackie and Rachel Robinson society.
“And as I said in my messages inviting members of the GW community to tonight’s program, there is no entity on the GW campus that has come close to GW baseball in supporting the goals and objectives of the Jackie Robinson project and the Jackie Rachel baseball society during the past 25 years,” Zamoff said.
In the final minutes of the award ceremony, the baseball program gave its own recognition award to Zamoff for his years of service to the Jackie Robinson program. He said he wanted to honor Zamoff’s 25-year involvement with both the project and society in educating students about the importance of Jackie Robinson’s impact on race relations within baseball.
“It has been our distinct honor, and I’m very, very humbled in this award for all the people past, but it goes without saying that this would not be something so specific in this world were not for Jackie and Rachel Robinson,” Ritchie said. “And also bringing that to fruition to everybody to hear to see and be educated about, through our young men aspire to be exactly, honoring our men throughout the years has been something very special.”
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported DiTomasso received the the Jackie and Rachel Robinson Society Community Recognition Award. Ritchie designated DiTomasso to accept the award on behalf of the baseball program. The Hatchet also incorrectly reported that the baseball had a program in hosting the award ceremony. The event was only organized by the Jackie Robinson Project and the Jackie and Rachel Robinson Society. A previous version of the article also misspelled the names of Karen Ercole and Stephen Butler. The correct spellings are now reflected. We regret these errors. This post has been updated to clarify Zamoff’s remarks about modern issues Robinson would work to address. This post has also been updated to clarify the attribution of a quote Zamoff read from a letter he received from former baseball Head Coach Tom Walter.

Graduate student guard Brendan Adams scored 19 points, leading a steady offensive barrage to keep the Colonials on top.
Men’s basketball took down Maryland Eastern Shore 69-64 Friday at the Smith Center, despite a furious, late-game run by the Hawks.

The GW guards’ relentless attack on the paint ultimately provided enough of a cushion for the Colonials (3-1) to eke out a win over the Hawks (1-3), with graduate student guard Brendan Adams and senior guard James Bishop IV contributing 17 and 19 points, respectively. GW improved to three wins on the season with its recent victory, rebounding from a tough loss on the road to Hofstra Nov. 14.
“The way they play defense, they put a lot of pressure, so if you get it inside, they’re going to break down in some places,” Adams said in a post-game interview. “So that was definitely a big point of emphasis, just getting it in the paint.” 
The game got off to a slow start for both teams with the score sitting at 5-5 after the first three minutes. But a signature snatch-back 3-pointer from Bishop and senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr.’s first alley-oop slam of the game provided a spark and had the GW fans rumbling.
Head Coach Chris Caputo emphasized the importance of student engagement in a post-game press conference.  
“It’s what can make this special as we move forward,” Caputo said. “It’s as much a part of what we need to do here as anything else, is create that really special bond with the students. They really brought it, and I expect them to bring it every time school’s in session.”
Despite the early makings of a dominant run, the Colonials couldn’t manage to pull away from the Hawks, and the score was knotted again with five minutes to go in the first half at 19-19. 
As the end of the first quarter approached, Bishop started to heat up. After splitting the Hawks’ defense down the middle and sinking a contested floater, he blew by his defender for a layup that gave GW a 25-19 lead and a window of opportunity. 
With a minute to go in the first, Lindo busted that window open, shaking the Smith Center with two rim-rattling alley-oop dunks, both off assists from Adams, to take GW into halftime with a 31-21 lead and momentum. 
Coming out of the gate in the second half, Maryland Eastern Shore began to chip away at the 10-point GW lead. Graduate student guard Ahamadou Fofana knocked in two free throws, a mid-range jumper and a 3-pointer to cut the Colonial advantage to just 5 at 36-31 with three minutes gone by in the half.
Thanks to a consistent offensive barrage from Bishop and Adams, the Colonials pulled away again, extending their lead to 55-36 with just six minutes left to go in the game.
But from then on, GW’s game started to fall apart. The Hawks’ full-court press, which the Colonials had done a good job at breaking for most of the game, suddenly began to present problems.
While the Colonials struggled with turnovers all game, finishing with 18 total, the last three minutes of the game were especially error-prone. In the last three minutes of the game, GW turned the ball over five times, allowing the Hawks to claw their way back into game.
“I’m going to give credit to UMES, because that’s their style of play, it’s what they do,” Caputo said. “We’ve got to really look at what we did there with the press break and then see why we turned it over a lot. I thought we hung on to it a little too much when we could have gotten it out of our hands.”
What had been a 19-point lead dwindled to just 9 with 45 seconds to go in the game. A 3-pointer from graduate student guard Donchevell Nugent cut it to 7 with thirty seconds left.
Ultimately, GW was able to secure critical rebounds and hold onto the ball long enough to hang on to their lead and escape with a 69-64 win.
Caputo said the team will miss having the student section packed next week as many students leave campus for the Thanksgiving holiday. 
“I’m going to miss them next week, I hope some people are hanging around,” he said. “Maybe if they want to have Thanksgiving at my house we can keep them around for some of these games. They’re two big home games.”
The Colonials play UC San Diego at the Smith Center Tuesday at 7 p.m.

Women’s basketball won their third game of the season Friday, topping American in a 67-62 nail-biter.
Women’s basketball won their third game of the season Friday, topping American in a 67-62 nail-biter where clutch free throws and offensive rebounds sealed the game in the final minutes.
The Colonials (3-1) got off to a strong start with 22 points in the first quarter, where freshman Mia Lakstigala scored 17 points and pulled down seven rebounds against the Eagles (0-2). The Colonials shot .278 percent from the field, which gave their offense just enough edge on the court to narrowly win against American.
The Colonials quickly got off to a hot start, scoring 8 points in the first four minutes, before the timeout, with a score of 8-6. With help from Taiwo, the Colonials shot a scalding-hot 53.3 percent in the quarter.
Taiwo had multiple put-back buckets in the first quarter, and junior guard Asjah Inniss stole the ball and finished on the other end to close out the first quarter. Both teams fought for rebounds and played tight defense, but the Colonials held on with a 9-6 lead.
The Colonials fought harder as they pulled down five more offensive rebounds that got them five second-chances shots, extending the lead to 9 to end the quarter. They ended the second half of the quarter stronger, scoring 14 points to bring the score to 22-13.
Coming into the second quarter, both teams had a slow start as the Colonials went 0-6 from the field. The Eagles burst to life in the third minute when they went on a sudden, 5-0 run that cut the lead to 3 with instant back-to-back baskets of two layups and a free throw for the Eagles.
The Colonials responded with a quick 5 points one minute before the time-out by the Eagles in the fifth minute, where senior Essence Brown hit a jumper that helped maintain the 9-point lead. The Colonials also pulled down 13 rebounds – their most of any quarter – which kept the Eagles from gaining second-chance shots.
GW gained momentum in the third quarter with a 7-3 run through great pass-and-cut plays, which allowed them to have a 9-point lead with a score of 42-33. Lakstigala had cut to the basket where she was then assisted by freshman Nya Robertson, who got her an easy basket.
Before the timeout by the Eagles in the fourth minute, they were able to extend their previous lead of five to 12 in the third minute, making this their biggest lead of the game yet.
The fourth quarter kicked off with the Eagles going on a 12-0 run that erased an 8-point deficit and secured their first lead of the game. Robertson entered the game in the fourth minute, where she brought the team back into the game with a 5-point run, which included a fast-break layup, a 3-pointer and a steal to help the Colonials catch up, only trailing by 1 on the sixth minute.
Before another timeout was called, the score was 57-58 for the Colonials. Lakstigala drew a foul by an Eagle player and sent to the free-throw line, netting both shots and getting the lead back up by one with 59-58.
In the final minutes of the quarter, the Eagles regained a 3-point lead inciting a back-and-forth battle until the last minute of the game where the Colonials gained a 3-point lead from an inbound play where Lakstigala was open and hit a 3-pointer that helped the Colonials got back their lead to 2 points.
The Colonials lead 65-62 in the final 47 seconds of the game where the Eagles hit a quick three to tie the game. The Colonials tightened defense on each player, causing hassle on Eagle’s inbound play and leading them to cause a turnover on their crucial last play.
To end the game, Lakstigala was fouled in the last 15 seconds, where she hit both free throws and concluded the game with a win for the Colonials with the score of 67-62.
The Colonials’ offense became key in their win against American as a couple of threes by Lakstigala regained momentum for the team in the final minutes of the match, ensuring their win.
The Colonials will take on California State Fullerton Titans at the Smith Center Sunday at noon.

If you have an ambitious research project due at the end of the semester, you can book a research appointment for one of the Library of Congress’ numerous collection-specific reading rooms.
With finals fast approaching, it can be all too easy to feel trapped in Foggy Bottom amid the pressure of studying, but take the time to traverse the blocks of the D.C. metro area lined with fresh spots to hit the books.
The city surrounding campus offers numerous quiet, concealed locations that make the perfect fit for peak productivity and stunning landmark views. Instead of stowing yourself away in your dorm for the next month, try one of these five secluded study spots spread out across the District and its suburbs.
Library of Congress
For your first excursion, saunter to the heart of the District and study at the Library of Congress. Simply register for a Reader Identification Card at the Reader Registration Center in the Madison Building with a government-issued identification card and you’ll be set to hit the books.
The Library of Congress’s grand main reading room sits under a mammoth dome lined with marble columns reaching down to the base of the floor, containing 226 connected semicircular wooden research desks rounding the entire space. From Egypt to Rome, a mural of 12 empires thought to contribute the most to human civilization stand in a circle around the dome, which overlooks the reading room far below. Sixteen larger-than-life bronze statues of figures including Plato and Michelangelo representing thought and activity circle the room on an upper level.
The library features a number of reading rooms spread through its various buildings themed around genres with books tailored to each topic, including a prints and photography room and a law library. If you have an ambitious research project due at the end of the semester, you can book a three-to-four-hour research appointment for one of the library’s numerous collection-specific reading rooms. For the international affairs major concentrating in Asia, check out the Asian reading room, and for those studying theater and dance, peruse the Performing Arts room.
101 Independence Ave. SE. Reading rooms are generally open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, though specific hours vary.
Cafe du Parc
Instead of letting final exams disrupt your ventures around D.C., slip away in the early morning to this Federal Triangle-based French restaurant and enjoy refreshing drinks, including any formulation of coffee. Enjoy an extensive brunch menu and sights of some of the District’s most iconic locations like the Washington Monument and Pershing Park. The brasserie offers an extensive menu for any meal – including a wide variety of coffees like the Italian-inspired iced espresso crema shakerato, espresso shots mixed with sugar and syrup to fuel your studying.
Cafe du Parc boasts an idyllic location where you can stay visually stimulated as you study and take in the sights of D.C. while avoiding the middle of the bustling tourist scene. As you sit at one of the restaurant’s many outdoor tables or within its upscale interior, check out the fountains and statues of Pershing Park and the World War I Memorial right across the street. When you start dozing off reviewing your notes, refocus your attention to catch some glimpses of the White House, Washington Monument and the U.S. Capitol in the distance before returning to your zone of focus.
1401 Pennsylvania Ave. NW in the Willard InterContinental Hotel. Open from 6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday and Monday and 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.
La Coop Coffee
Discover a homely and secluded cafe near the outer edges of the District in Manor Park. La Coop Coffee offers sweet, caffeinated brews imported straight from the owner’s hometown of Union Cantnil, Guatemala. But be careful not to stumble across its unassuming residential-looking building – its signature cafe offers the the ideal environment for you to conquer your papers inside.
The exterior of the shop looks like a suburban house complete with a white picket fence, but inside the living room-sized space sit plenty of tables, couches and counters. Students can study in a peaceful space while surrounded by white walls covered in shelf-seated plants and pictures of the Guatemalan farmers who provide the shop’s coffee.
If the inside of the store, which can only hold about 10 people at a time, feels too loud or cramped for you, the grassy backyard filled with picnic tables and a wooden porch features plenty of seating in a quieter environment, where students can escape campus and find a snug, homey setting.
5505 1st St. NW. Open from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekends.
Potter’s House
Instead of situating yourself within Gelman Library’s stacks of books and dull fluorescent lights for days on end, meander over to this historic bookstore and bistro in Adams Morgan. Between its rustic wooden tables and bookshelves, floor to ceiling windows and a mural of a candle exuding streams of rainbow light above the entrance, this cafe gives you the chance to seclude yourself within rows upon rows of bookshelves free from the fluorescent lights of Gelman Library.
Potter’s House offers indoor seating at tables spread throughout the store in addition to limited patio seating. Take a peek at the menu, full of warm, caffeinated drinks under $5, packing flavors like caramel, nut and chocolate. Read about Native American culture or the feminist movement to immerse yourself in the store’s books that specialize in topics like equity and justice – even if you finish your studies early you’ll have no shortage of stories in these shelves.
1658 Columbia Road NW. Open from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on weekdays and 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends.
Bayou Bakery
Take a day just outside of the District to visit this southern-inspired cozy cafe in Arlington for a taste of New Orleans. Though far-reaching in size, this cafe offers a quiet environment with its specialty New Orleans cuisine that takes heavy influence from Cajun, Creole and soul food. With a roughly 15-minute Metro ride from campus to Court House station, walk two minutes to the hidden away spot at the bottom of Arlington’s high-rise buildings. The bakery hosts patio seating and symmetrical square tables and chairs – certain to suit your study set-up preferences.
Bayou Bakery presents an extensive menu of baked goods, most notably their beignets ($3.75) – New Orleans-style donuts which are essentially fried cubes of dough covered in powdered sugar. The pastries are the perfect treat if you’re in need of a sugar boost when studying wears you down.
1515 N Courthouse Road, Arlington, Virginia. Open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends.

Students athletes have received national and regional recognition for academic success in previous years, not only for graduation rates but also for their grade point average in the classroom. 

Student-athletes graduate at a 94 percent rate at GW, exceeding the Division I average, according to U.S. Department of Education data the NCAA released Tuesday.
GW Athletics’ graduation success rate – which the NCAA calculates to measure the number of students who enter and graduate college – topped the NCAA’s 90 percent recorded across DI institutions, according to an athletics department release issued Tuesday. The release states the data covers students who entered college between the 2012-13 and 2015-16 academic years as part of a six-year cohort that Education Department “prescribed.”
Seven programs achieved a perfect 100 score, including men’s and women’s cross country and track, volleyball, golf, gymnastics, women’s soccer and women’s tennis, according to the release.
The release states the NCAA developed the graduation rate to address college and university presidents who wanted a more accurate reflection of graduation data among all college students. The NCAA’s graduation success rate traces athletes who received aid to compete “for any period of time during their first year” and accounts for the academic outcomes of student-athletes who transfer from one institution to another, the release states.
“It is rewarding to see each and every student graduate and commence into their field of choice, and these sterling GSR numbers are a testament to the academic excellence that our student-athletes, coaches and support staff prioritize,” Director of Athletics Tanya Vogel said in the release.
Students-athletes have received national and regional recognition for academic success in previous years, not only for graduation rates but also for their grade point average in the classroom.
The Atlantic 10 named 274 GW student-athletes to the Conference Commissioner’s Honor Roll for the 2020-21 academic year, with a combined 3.5 average GPA throughout the pandemic.
A total of 26 teams held at least a combined 3.0 GPA in spring 2021, with 257 student-athletes securing at least a 3.5 GPA. 49 student-athletes recorded a 4.0 GPA that semester, while 378 student-athletes maintained at least a 3.0 GPA, according to the release.
The A-10 has yet to publicize the student-athletes it has named to its honor role for the previous academic year.
Men’s tennis led all GW sports programs in the spring with a combined 3.91 team GPA, followed by gymnastics with a 3.82. Women’s soccer registered a 3.74 mark, followed by golf with a 3.71 and women’s cross country and track with a 3.67.
