Officials will award Stevenson, the author of The New York Times bestseller “Just Mercy” and the executive director of the nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative, an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.
Social justice advocate, attorney and author Bryan Stevenson will address the Class of 2023 during this year’s Commencement, officials announced Monday.
Officials will award Stevenson, the author of The New York Times bestseller “Just Mercy” and the executive director of the nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative, an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, the release states. Stevenson founded EJI in Alabama in 1989 and has led the organization in its goal of advocating for prisoners who were wrongly convicted, denied proper legal representation or whose trials were influenced by racial bias.
“George Washington University has a long history of producing outstanding graduates who have made a profound difference in the world,” Stevenson said in the release. “I am honored to have the opportunity to speak to them on such an extraordinary day in the life of every university student.”
Stevenson’s career began in 1985 as a staff attorney at the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta, and he has served as a member of the New York University School of Law’s faculty since 1998, according to the release. Stevenson has earned an array of awards and honors since founding EJI, including the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Medal of Liberty, the MacArthur Foundation’s “Genius” Prize and the Olof Palme Prize for international human rights, according to the release.
Stevenson graduated from Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania with a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy in 1981. He then continued his education at Harvard University where he graduated in 1985 with a master’s in public policy and a law degree.
His 2014 book “Just Mercy” details injustices in the American legal system and Stevenson’s work to overturn the conviction of Walter McMillian, a Black man wrongly sentenced to death for a murder he didn’t commit. “Just Mercy” was adapted into a 2019 film of the same name, which featured Michael B. Jordan playing Stevenson and Jamie Foxx playing McMillian.
Stevenson was also the subject of the HBO documentary “True Justice: Bryan Stevenson’s Fight for Equality,” which won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Social Issue Documentary.
“As an advocate for human rights, representative for the wrongly convicted and unfairly sentenced and leader of anti-poverty and anti-discrimination efforts, Bryan Stevenson will serve as an inspiration to our graduates,” interim University President Mark Wrighton said in the release. “We are honored that Mr. Stevenson will provide the keynote address at our Commencement ceremony on the National Mall.”

GW officials claim they recognize the value of diversity, equity and inclusion. But a recently revived, five-year-old lawsuit accusing the University of discrimination shows the extent to which GW as an institution – and its students – have perpetuated a persistent culture of racism on campus, most recently in a rash of racist incidents in the classroom last year.
Former GW student Jabari Stafford is asking the University for $1 million in damages for its failure to properly address the discriminatory conduct and subsequent mental and emotional distress he faced while playing on GW’s men’s tennis team from 2014 to 2017. Last month, D.C.’s Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Stafford after he appealed a January 2022 District Court ruling that dismissed his lawsuit over the statute of limitations to evaluate discrimination claims.
The court will decide whether GW discriminated against Stafford, who is Black, based on the color of his skin. The University does not deny that Stafford faced “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive” racist abuse while on the tennis team. “No other student-athlete – no human being – should have to go through what my son went through,” wrote Tom Stafford, Stafford’s father, in an op-ed The Hatchet published in June 2022.
Because while the Staffords are bringing the University to court, the culture that students of color face at GW remains very much intact. The free-flowing racist abuse on the men’s tennis team reflects the actions of students as much as it does the incompetence, strategic or otherwise, of the University’s administration in dealing with it.
According to the lawsuit, members of the men’s tennis team called Stafford “monkey” and other racial slurs, asked him if his ancestors were slaves and posted memes including the N-word. The lawsuit also alleges that teammates sexually harassed and assaulted another player who is a person of color. Stafford’s coaches only furthered this persistent abuse, allegedly downplaying the nature of his teammates’ racist remarks and disproportionately targeting Stafford and other nonwhite players with disciplinary procedures, including suspension from the team in 2015.
At the beginning of his junior year in 2016, Stafford and his father told Ed Scott, the former senior associate director of athletics, and Helen Cannaday Saulny, the former associate provost for diversity, equity and community engagement, about the racist incidents on the tennis team. Scott and Cannaday first responded with “mortification” but proceeded to direct Stafford to GW’s grievance filing website, which enables students to register complaints against faculty and staff members for discrimination. After suffering years of racist abuse, officials effectively advised Stafford to sift through legalese and draft an email.
Together, the Staffords said they faced a byzantine process, back-and-forth communication and inaction despite those mortified reactions. “I did everything in my power to support my son,” Stafford wrote. “If these officials knew what was happening to my son, and they knew it was wrong, why didn’t they do anything to stop it?”
GW’s institutions – like the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement and GW Athletics – offered little to no recourse to Stafford and other nonwhite athletes on the tennis team, allowing a culture of hate to flourish essentially unchecked. Forms, processes and procedures, notwithstanding, how was this allowed to go on for so long?
“It is worth noting that complaints filed in court only represent one side’s view of a case,” then-University spokesperson Lindsay Hamilton said when The Hatchet began covering Stafford’s case in 2018. That may be true, but it does not take a legal degree to note that no matter how much the University says it values diversity, equity and inclusion, it has failed to put those values into practice.
These terms are not boilerplate rhetoric to us. Nor, as Stafford’s very lawsuit shows, are they a simple way to avoid legal action. They are a set of principles, and failing to adhere to them has real consequences. The horrific, racist abuse Stafford faced drove him off the tennis team and out of GW at the end of 2017 – it deprived a student-athlete of his chance to learn and his chance to compete. 
But what happened to Stafford began with fellow and now-former members of the student body. The success of student-athletes – or any student – cannot overpower the need to hold them accountable if, or when, they discriminate against their peers. The camaraderie of the tennis team and the experience of a college education should have been a place for these student-athletes to unlearn their biases and confront their racism with the lived experience of their teammates. Instead, the abhorrent behavior of the team’s players against Stafford, just one of roughly 800 Black men at GW during the four years he was enrolled here, only intensified.
GW students don’t shy away from making our voices heard or demanding justice. This is the same student body who rushed to the Supreme Court in May to protest the leaked decision overturning Roe v. Wade and again in June once the court made its decision. But it seems that few of us have heard or spoken about Stafford’s case during its long and ongoing journey through the legal system, allowing the University to keep the case out of the court of public opinion.
So, we have something to say. We are sorry, Jabari, as a student body that we let this happen. It shouldn’t have, and we’re sorry. For you, for us and for everyone who comes here after, this has to change. We need it to.
We will all be lucky if the court rules in Stafford’s favor – it’s a small price for GW to pay to learn that diversity, equity and inclusion is a commitment, not just three words.

That old staccato rhythm is ringing out across Foggy Bottom again. In the rush out of residence halls, up and down flights of stairs and on the way to class, sneakers, loafers, flats and boots click and clack, squelch and squish. School is back and in session, and it’s time to pound pavement from E Street to Washington Circle.
When amenities like bars, gyms, grocery stores and barbershops are just a few blocks away in a contiguous grid of letters, numbers and states, it’s easy to get around on foot. Walking isn’t as fast or flashy as a scooter or bicycle, nor does it come with air conditioning or a trunk – hope for a gentle breeze and pack lightly. In fact, walking is such a dull exercise that it’s pedestrian in every sense of the word.
But head a few blocks south to the National Mall, as I have these past few weeks, and the simple act of walking becomes inseparable from politics. While the naked trees and yellowed grass of the Mall in winter don’t inspire awe, there’s something powerful about methodically meandering past the familiar landmarks.
On the Friday before the start of spring semester, I paced along the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, watching in the quiet of dusk as the setting sun bounced off the black stone and a sea of names caught glints of fading gold. I listened to the wind-whipped American flags of the Washington Monument thrash against their poles, snapping and cracking in the chilly wind. The fountains of remembrance run dry this time of year, but I still went round and round the World War II Memorial’s sloping basin, past 50 states and U.S. territories bound together in sacrifice.
It’s impossible to rush through the Mall when you can only go as fast as your feet can carry you, a generous 3 miles per hour. But why go any faster? In putting one foot in front of another, I’m tracing the footsteps of hundreds of thousands of people who have roamed the Mall before me. Bound up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, turn around and imagine the March on Washington some 60 years ago. Yes, the March on Washington, not the bike, the scoot or the drive, but the march – the walk.
But whether you walk to stroll past Americana or simply get from point A to point B, walking is political. Public officials determine which streets to close for demonstrations, like last week’s anti-abortion March for Life – again, another walk. They set the length of crossing signals, build and repair sidewalks and turn streets, however briefly, into public plazas. This spring, the D.C. Office of Planning will evaluate whether the city can link Foggy Bottom, the Georgetown Waterfront and Rock Creek Park with new pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in contrast to the current tangle of highways and freeways that divides the areas.
And as of Friday, 75 Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, including Foggy Bottom and West End ANCs Yannik Omictin, Trupti Patel and Jordan Nassar, have signed a letter calling on the D.C. government “to meaningfully prioritize equity in public transportation and traffic safety infrastructure.” The letter’s signatories are refusing their government-issued parking passes, a move meant to encourage the city to reinvest the thousands of dollars it takes to build and maintain on-street parking spaces into pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure.
Flip through different District-wide data sets, and a familiar pattern emerges. When it comes to walkability – marked by the state of sidewalks and the proximity of resources like jobs, schools and parks to people’s homes – the predominantly Black and historically underserved Wards 5, 7 and 8 are falling behind the rest of D.C. More than one-third of Washingtonians lived car-free in 2019 but not necessarily by choice given the cost of owning, operating and storing a private vehicle. So faced with less-than-reliable service from Metrobus and Metrorail and a hodgepodge of bikes, scooters and rideshares, walking – at least for the physically able – can become a method of last resort.
Back in Foggy Bottom, my walks to the Mall are about 5 miles roundtrip. But Ken Woodward has walked some 2,085 miles around the District, traveling to every street and alley in D.C. while wearing a sign reading “Black and Brown lives matter” between May 2020 and May 2022. “Walking a neighborhood is far different than whisking through in a car or avoiding them all together,” Woodward wrote in an August 2022 Instagram post reflecting on his journey. At its best, walking allows us to reflect, to connect and to listen to one another as we strive to better ourselves – a journey for Woodward that meant “ridding” himself of white supremacy.
But the echoing of rubber soles on pavement can also reveal deep-seated prejudices. In September 2022, three U.S. Park Police officers tased Jonathan McKinney, who is Black, three times after he asked a plainclothes officer not to speak to him when the officer allegedly grimaced before asking how he was doing. McKinney, a professional dogwalker, had been walking home through the Palisades neighborhood after walking a dog. The phenomenon of “Walking While Black,” as Don Temple described his client’s experience, invites serious questions – who gets to walk? Where? How?
I don’t have all the answers. But I do know that a better future runs through creating a world, or at least a District, in which anyone can walk on any street or stroll through any neighborhood and feel safe doing so. There may not be a monument to it on the Mall, but remember the power of a walk the next time you hear that old staccato rhythm.

Frumin said he entered the “big firm world” after graduating from GW Law, observing elections in Nicaragua, Morocco, Iraq and Mongolia with the International Human Rights Law Group.
Updated: Jan. 23, 2023 at 1:33 p.m.
While jumping from private practice to hyper-local issues throughout his career, GW Law alumnus Matthew Frumin has had his eyes set on joining the D.C. Council for a decade.
Frumin, a 63-year-old alumnus who graduated from GW Law in 1988, won the Ward 3 seat on the D.C. Council in November with more than three-quarters of the vote. Frumin said he hopes to tackle Ward 3’s racially and socioeconomically segregative history, support environmentally friendly transportation policies and bolster citywide education during his first term serving the ward.
Frumin will succeed another GW community member with ties to GW Law – law professor Mary Cheh, who served on the Council for 16 years.
He said he applied to the school a few years after graduating from college and considering studying economics at the University of Maryland instead. He said he “thrived” at law school, piquing his interest in international politics, including legal matters over airspace.
“I was literally keeping my options open in the first two weeks of law school,” Frumin said. “I found it super interesting, like right out of the box. It’s problem solving.”
Frumin said he entered the “big firm world” after graduating from GW Law, observing elections in Nicaragua, Morocco, Iraq and Mongolia with the International Human Rights Law Group. When he picked up a seat on his local Advisory Neighborhood Commission, 3E – which spans Tenleytown, Friendship Heights and American University Park – in 2008, his career “turned on a dime,” and he moved toward local politics.
Frumin said he launched a bid for an At-Large seat on the D.C. Council in 2013 after serving on his ANC for more than six years, despite being a partner of law firm Cassidy & Kent at the time. During his term as a commissioner, he said he juggled constituent resistance over the ideal location of American University’s law school and negotiated with AU officials to draft an AU Campus Plan in 2012, which outlined preparations for new university facilities in his area.
Frumin said he’s “very proud” of his work advocating for light installation at his local baseball field, Chevy Chase Recreation Center, so kids could have the “thrilling” big league experience while protecting the informal dog park on the field from being displaced during the modernization.
“Both of those are illustrations of how I tried to operate, which is really to listen and then try to build consensus,” Frumin said.
Frumin lost the 2014 D.C. Council At-Large race to then-incumbent Anita Bonds, who now holds the position and won 20 percent more of the vote share than Frumin’s 11 percent tally.
He said despite the loss, the campaign was a “fabulous” experience that fostered his appreciation for the District and buttressed his interest in running for a seat on the Council.
But Frumin said his future run for the Council had to come at the right time – without a contested bit from Cheh.
“She’s terrific,” Frumin said. “I couldn’t make the argument to myself that I would be better than she is.”
But when Cheh dropped her reelection bid last February, Frumin said he immediately knew he would run for her seat. After assuming the position in January and looking ahead to the rest of his four-year term, Frumin said he will push for funding capable of improving primary and secondary schools across the city and work to increase housing density and affordability to “strengthen” communities in business districts.
Frumin said he hopes to enrich the lives of seniors through elderly focused programs and home health care options.
He said he also plans to incentivize affordable housing in Ward 3 to address it’s “exclusive” and “segregated” history.
After the 1970s, D.C. officials adjusted zoning laws to conserve single-family homes in Ward 3 and push low-income housing to other parts of the District, which has had lasting effects on the demographics of the neighborhood. More than 80 percent of the area’s residents are white, despite making up just 40 percent of D.C.’s total population, and about two percent of the population lives in poverty compared to 10 percent of the District’s total residents.
Frumin said housing for both low-income and blue-collar residents in his ward is key to tackling the existing division between the area’s historically wealthy residents and newcomers. He pledged to create incentives for those communities to live in the area, including affordable housing and “cutting edge” ideas.
“I thought, ‘What do we need to do to make Ward 3 more attractive to those people who might be able to afford to live here but choose not to because we haven’t crossed the threshold of enough people who look like to make them feel comfortable?’” Frumin said.
Upon joining the Council, Frumin has voted in support of contentious bills in the past month, like overriding Mayor Muriel Bowser’s veto of the criminal code, which reduces sentences for nonviolent offenses and allows prosecutors to propose harsher rulings for serious offenses, including those involving firearms.
Frumin said Bowser vetoed the legislation in early January to show her “tough on crime” stance, and he called the Council’s move to revise the code “sensible” because the code has gone untouched for more than 100 years.
The Council voted 12-1 to override the veto last week, with Ward 8 Council member Trayon White Sr. being the sole opposing vote. Frumin said it didn’t make sense for Bowser to veto the legislation because of the 16 years of “enormous” work updating the legislation, which will become effective in October 2025, permitting more revision time on unpopular policies.
Metropolitan Police Department records show both violent and property crimes went down in the District in 2022 compared to the year prior. While officials recorded 203 homicides last year – a 10 percent drop from 2021 – the statistic is twice the number recorded 10 years prior.
“The Council’s changes didn’t cause the crime that we’re having, and the politics of crime are terrible,” Frumin said. “That’s what this was, the politics.”
Frumin also voiced his support for a bill that would offer rebates for electric bicycles proposed last week by Brooke Pinto, the Ward 2 Council member who represents the area encompassing Foggy Bottom.
He said he and his wife share an e-bike, which he rides everywhere because it doesn’t congest traffic or require gasoline. He added that others should make the switch to nonvehicular transportation if they can afford to do so to open up streets for those who cannot.
“Let’s leave the parking spaces for them, let’s leave this space on the road,” Frumin said. “It’s the future. And it’s the policy of the Democratic Party.”
Max Porter and Vaughan Goff contributed reporting.
The Hatchet updated this post to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Frumin voted in favor of D.C.’s revised criminal code. Frumin did not vote in favor of the revised criminal code, but he did vote in favor of the council’s override of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s veto of the bill. We regret this error.

Neharika Rao, the SA's executive secretary of diversity, equity and inclusion, and Aiza Saeed, the executive cabinet's communications director, worked with officials to develop the logistics behind installing the machine and pricing the contraceptives.
 
Officials installed and opened the contraceptive vending machine in the University Student Center Tuesday morning.
The machine sells a generic version of Plan B for $25. CVS currently sells Plan B at $49.99 per pill, according to its website.

Officials are set to install a contraceptive pill vending machine in the University Student Center Tuesday in an effort to support students’ access to reproductive health resources seven months after the Supreme Court struck down the federal right to an abortion.
The machine, which SA members said will be ready to use later this week, will offer Plan B and other medical supplies like Tylenol, Advil and tampons for students on the ground floor of the University Student Center near the GWorld Card Office. Assistant Dean of Student Life Brian Joyce said officials “worked directly” with Student Association leaders since the start of the school year to install the machine, performing research and meeting with Northeastern University officials, who already installed similar machines.
“In the wake of Roe v. Wade, students advocated to remove multiple barriers they faced in accessing needs for reproductive health,” Joyce said in an email.
SA President Christian Zidouemba and his executive cabinet approached officials at Northeastern University this summer, which installed Plan B vending machines on their campus in October, for advice on how to do the same at GW. Zidouemba said after he pitched the project to Dean of Student Life Collette Coleman in early September, SA members and officials started meeting to plan the logistics surrounding the machine.
“I believe that this is a new initiative that will benefit our University overall,” Zidouemba said in an interview. “And those who oftentimes don’t have the money or are shy will be able to purchase the product at a lower cost.”
Zidouemba delegated the project to sophomore Neharika Rao – the SA’s executive secretary of diversity, equity and inclusion – in September. Rao said officials were “quick to support” the project.
Rao then recruited Aiza Saeed, the executive cabinet’s communications director, to collaborate with her on the project. The two worked closely with Joyce and other administrators to develop the logistics behind installing the machine and pricing the contraceptives.
“With the implementation of an emergency contraceptive machine at GW’s campus, students will feel supported and at ease in a time of need,” she said in an email.
Rao said Plan B from the machine will be sold at $30 as of this week, but she hopes the price will decrease as the machine gains use. CVS currently sells Plan B at $49.99 per pill, according to its website.
Universities across the country have rushed to expand student access to contraceptives after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, which triggered widespread protests in defense of reproductive rights.
Northeastern University currently offers sexual health supplies, like condoms and Advil, at no cost to students, while emergency contraceptives, including Plan B, cost $7. Northeastern unveiled its “wellness vending machine” in October, which took about a semester to finalize.
Boston University installed a similar machine in March.
This past Sunday marked the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and the White House reaffirmed its commitment to reproductive rights as activists participated in the Women’s March.
Student leaders at GW submitted an open letter calling on administrators to remove Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas from his faculty position at GW Law after he voted in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade in June. In late July, Thomas stepped down from teaching the Constitutional Law Seminar that he planned to co-teach in fall 2022.
More than 25 students said increasing access to contraceptives will promote sexual health, but the machine’s location in the publicly accessible University Student Center may pose privacy concerns.
Aaliyah Guzman, a sophomore majoring in political communication, said officials should install contraceptive vending machines in residence halls, where many students might be more likely to realize they need contraceptives during any hour of the day or night. They said the limited hours of the student center, which closes from midnight to 7 a.m. daily, could be an obstacle to quick access to the medical supplies.
“Wherever they put it, it needs to be a place where students can get into all day,” Guzman said. “The student center closes at midnight right now, which is not extremely helpful.”
Ashvini Selvanayagam, a sophomore studying public health, said the installation of the machine and their easy access could reduce stigma surrounding the use of contraceptives.
“I definitely think it would help destigmatize and also normalize the idea of Plan B and also talking about sex as something that’s normal,” she said.
Selvanayagam said she became concerned over her sexual welfare after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade because it demonstrated the politicization of sexual health. She said the installation of the machine would make her more comfortable because it would provide a more guaranteed way to access contraceptives in an emergency.
“Especially since the pandemic, it definitely puts my right to have control over my own body at risk,” she said. “So it definitely put a lot of questions in the air.”
Lucy Pritchard, a freshman studying political science, said while the University Center is still partly inaccessible to students because the building is closed from midnight to 7 a.m., increased access to contraceptives could relieve stress for students who need quick access to them during their daily class schedule.
“It helps you manage your life, and it’ll take stress away from students, which will make people do better in classes,” Pritchard said. “If you don’t have access to that, then it can be a very stressful experience.”

Protesters said they took to the streets to celebrate the successes of the anti-abortion movement and continue their push for state officials to cease access to abortion.
In a celebratory jaunt through the National Mall Friday, tens of thousands of anti-abortion protesters called on state legislatures to end abortion protections nationwide during the first March for Life since the 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade.
Protesters from across the country embarked on a unique route straying from the march’s decades-old course down Constitution Avenue and First Street, instead symbolically marching to the Capitol in a nod to the post-Roe calls to shift the battle over abortion from the high court to state legislatures. Protesters said they took to the streets to celebrate the successes of the anti-abortion movement and continue their push for state officials to cease access to abortion.
Merlot Fogarty, a University of Notre Dame junior and the president of Notre Dame’s chapter of the anti-abortion group Right to Life, said the club is the biggest anti-abortion student group in the United States and that 500 of the Notre Dame student groups’ members attended the March for Life this year. She said there was a new “sense of excitement” compared to last year’s march because of Roe v. Wade’s reversal.
“In my opinion, I think the reason we’re here nationally this year is to give thanks to the 50 years of activism and hard work that people have given in order for Roe to be overturned,” she said.
Fogarty said she supports policy that focuses on maternity leave to allow working women to continue getting paid as they carry out their pregnancies. She said the United States is “divided” at the moment, and she wants people from all political parties to “find common ground” within the issue of abortion.
“It’s very clear that everyone needs to have an opinion on abortion just because of the decision that happened,” she said.
Bartholomew Calvano, a priest at St. Dominic Church in D.C., said the route of the march was different this year compared to previous years, with the demonstrators walking all the way to the Capitol instead of the Supreme Court, a deliberate choice to mark a shift in the movement’s efforts.
“We’re ending with the legislative branch instead of the judicial branch since that’s the direction that our efforts are going to need to turn to encourage our legislators to enact just laws that protect human life,” he said.
Michael Martin, a freshman at University of Cincinnati and vice president of outreach for UC Students for Life, said the March for Life has always been a “joyful” event. He said that although they are excited about the Roe v. Wade reversal, the movement is now focusing more on urging state governments to enact stricter anti-abortion policies.
“It’s more of a celebratory march this time but also now the real fight begins on our end because we actually have to get out into the streets and get legislation instead of getting judicial opinions,” he said.
GW freshman Lara Knezevic, a pro-choice counter-protester who met the anti-abortion protesters at the Supreme Court with a sign reading “Stop Prosecuting Abortion,” said she came to represent the “large” amount of pro-choice individuals who are continuing to push against abortion restrictions spreading nationwide.
She said she attempted to engage in conversations with anti-abortion protesters to discuss their differing perspectives but was unable to establish any “productive” discussions with protesters seemingly unwilling to consider the opposite point of view.
“No one wants to engage in a conversation,” Knezevic said. “They kind of just want to berate you and tell you that you’re wrong without giving much explanation.”
Knezevic said she hopes women can unite to support legal and accessible abortions and reproductive healthcare nationwide through advocacy like aiding access to abortion clinics without interference from anti-abortion protesters who may be blocking their path.
“I just really wish that people come to more women’s marches because this is exactly what we’re protesting for,” Knezevic said.
Megan Clancy, a sophomore and the president of GW Catholics, said a group of about 20 students attended the march with GW Catholics after first gathering for Mass Friday morning at the GW Catholics Newman Center. She said GW Catholics has attended the March for Life in previous years, and while the 2023 march was her first, Clancy said there was a feeling of “celebration” during the protest following Roe v. Wade’s reversal.
Clancy said with Roe v. Wade overturned, the goals of the anti-abortion movement have not been fully achieved, and individuals should shift the response to “unplanned” or “crisis pregnancies” from abortions to an emphasis on supporting crisis pregnancy centers and investing in resources to support pregnant and parenting women.
“As a woman, I truly believe abortion policies are evidence that our society has failed to provide to the needs of women,” Clancy said.

Katrin Schultheiss, an associate professor of history, said while future iterations of AI technology may be able to produce more credible writing, that faculty should continue to face AI-related issues head-on.

Faculty informed community members on the potential impact of AI, like ChatGPT on higher education, teaching them how the technology can be applied inside the classroom at an event Wednesday.
The meeting is the first in an ongoing series at GW exploring the opportunities and challenges associated with new AI technologies like ChatGPT that faculty are planning to incorporate into future curricula, as officials prepare a disciplinary response for students who use AI writing as a substitute for their assignments. Professors Lorena Barba, Alexa Alice Joubin, Ryan Watkins and Associate Professor Katrin Schultheiss spoke at the meeting in the National Churchill Leadership Center in Gelman Library, where 180 attendees joined the hybrid event.
Schultheiss, an associate professor of history, said while future iterations of AI technology may be able to produce more credible writing, that faculty should continue to face AI-related issues head-on.
“That’s reality, and it’s going to take us a while to adjust to it, and we have to acknowledge the fact that this is going to be wrenching for many of us because there are no easy solutions,” she said. “That’s why we’re here. We need to think collectively about how we can address these issues.”
Watkins, a professor of education at the Graduate School of Education and Human Development, said he plans to have his students use ChatGPT to write outlines for class presentations.
“I might have my students use it as a starting place, and then they can add their content in and make comments about how useful or not useful it was,” he said.
Watkins said faculty across the University should update their course syllabi to include ChatGPT in a December blog post that yielded “positive feedback” from those who plan to use Large Language Models like ChatGPT in their courses.
“There are going to be lots of ways this integrates into different disciplines in different fields,” he said. “And I think it’s going to be both exciting and it’s gonna be scary at times.”
Barba, a professor of engineering, said the University should begin an initiative to increase “AI literacy” in the community so faculty can adequately incorporate AI technology into their classrooms for students to experience its many benefits, like writing feedback.
Barba said that while there are some “limitations” with ChatGPT, including its lack of human virtues like creativity and common sense, it can independently provide student feedback on grammar and style through a personal conversational agent.
Faculty will host a day-long symposium on April 14 called “I Am Not a Robot, the Entangled Futures of AI and Humanities,” which will discuss the philosophical and ethical issues associated with the use of AI in the modern world.
