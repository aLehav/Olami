The email states the only exclusions to the policy are tax-exempt social fraternities and sororities and contact sports.
More than 20 student organizations were found to have violated GW’s gender, race and religion nondiscrimination policy, according to an email officials sent to those organizations last month. 
Director of Student Involvement and Leadership Anne Graham contacted the student organizations Sept. 15 asking them to submit an updated constitution to the Office of Student Life by Dec. 14, according to an email obtained by The Hatchet. Graham said the groups’ governing policies have “selective criteria” for members allowed in the organization that did not align with GW’s policy, which states organizations can’t discriminate against any person based on criteria, like race or religion.
The email states the only exclusions to the policy are tax-exempt social fraternities and sororities and contact sports. Alternative sorority and fraternity life organizations are not exempt and “cannot use sex, gender, gender identity or gender expression” to determine who is allowed in the organization, according to the email.
“The University does allow organizations to choose between open and selective criteria for membership – however, selective criteria for general membership into the organization must abide by University policy, including its nondiscrimination policies,” the email states.
Graham said officials contacted 23 student organizations like Girls Who Code College Loop, the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Albanian American Student Association.
She said the office contacted each organization individually during a regular audit of the groups’ governing documents to alert them of the violation and offer support as they adapt their policies. She said selective membership criteria allows groups to invite students with specific traits, like a dance group accepting students with dance skills, but prohibits them from choosing members on the basis of characteristics like race, gender and religion.
“Affinity and identity-centric spaces are important for celebrating, relationship building and support, especially for members of marginalized communities,” Graham said in an email. “We believe that this can be achieved through clear articulation of the student organization’s mission, values and goals while avoiding exclusion based on any protected characteristic.” 
Four student leaders said they were “surprised” to have been told they would need to update their policies because they had not been alerted about the policy earlier. Two student organizations declined to comment and 17 did not return to requests for comment.
The office contacted all student organizations in 2018 to include language identifying actions like discriminatory behavior and harassment as a cause to remove members in their governing documents.
Senior Emmoni Morrisey, the president of the dance group Queens Movement, said it was “not OK” to be told after almost two years of operating as an organization focused on women’s empowerment that they would need to readjust the group’s bylaws. She said the group has started to figure out how to change their programming, but leaders will have difficulty working on an updated constitution while members are studying remotely.
“Queens Movement is focused on women’s empowerment – how can we be more open and inclusive within our organization if our organization is meant to support women?” Morrisey said in an email. 
Senior Zoe Ades, the president of the Epsilon Sigma Alpha service sorority, said Graham’s email asking them to open recruitment to males was unexpected because they previously have “expressly” welcomed nonbinary and gender-nonconforming individuals in their constitution in addition to students who identify as female.
She said members of the group believe it’s “crucial” for there to be spaces where women, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming students feel comfortable and “prioritized” on campus. She said the group was “bothered” they were not excluded from the policy, as was the Panhellenic Association, because they consider themselves a sorority. 
“We are concerned that these changes could undermine safe spaces for women, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming people on campus,” Ades said in an email. 
She said the group updated its constitution after the email in September to adhere to GW policy but doesn’t anticipate changing events and activities planned before the email was sent. She said the chapter kept their same constitution but removed a part that said students “who identify as women as well as nonbinary and gender-nonconforming” can join.
“Despite these concerns, we remain committed to remaining a safe and empowering place for all of our sisters, regardless of their gender identity, and are confident that these new measures will not infringe upon our ability to do so,” Ades said.
Senior Manush Mobarhan, the president of Delta Phi Epsilon professional foreign service sorority, said DPE has existed on campus since 2006 and served a “crucial” role empowering female voices in international affairs, which she said is “incredibly male-dominated.” She said while she understands the logic behind the concerns, the updates seemed like an “overly literal application” of Title IX.
“Title IX tried to protect students from discrimination, and sometimes the best way to do that is to create a space specifically for minority voices,” Mobarhan said in an email. “Orgs like DPE sorority, Women in Finance, GW Women of Color, Women in Computer Science and so much more are necessary for equal opportunity.”
Mobarhan added that the email came as a “shock,” and she has reached out to the student life office for assistance with transitioning programming and spring recruitment to be gender-inclusive.
“We were also given until the end of December 2020 to make this change, which is an incredibly fast turn around for an org that has existed for over 14 years,” Mobarhan said. “I hope they will be flexible in this timeline.”

This piece was written by a group of professors – Dwayne Wright, a visiting assistant professor of higher education; Julia Storberg-Walker, an associate professor of human and organizational learning; Gregory Squires, a professor of sociology and public policy and public administration; Dan Moshenberg, a Women’s Gender and Sexuality Studies associate professor of English; Christopher Britt, an associate professor of Spanish; Ivy Ken, an associate professor of sociology; Laura Schiavo, an associate professor of museum studies and a member of the Faculty Association’s steering committee; Kathryn Kleppinger, an associate professor of French studies and international affairs; Erin Chapman, an associate professor of history; Neal Chalofsky, an associate professor emeritus of human and organizational learning; and Brian Casemore, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education and Human Development.
As professors of GW, we urge the Faculty Senate to approve a resolution Friday censuring University President Thomas LeBlanc for hiring Heather Swain.
This resolution was first on the senate’s agenda last month. At that time, senators decided to recommit the resolution committee for further investigation of what many of us already knew. The committee did as instructed and has now returned a month later with a continued recommendation of censure. We urge that the time for delay and obstruction in holding leadership accountable for this failure is well overdue.
Across the University, departments, programs, the Student Association, the GW Staff Advocacy and Equity Coalition, the Faculty Association and independent faculty leaders have taken a consistent and sustained position opposing LeBlanc’s leadership. All are calling for a repair in the moral fabric of our University and calling out GW’s president for what the senate calls “violating the core principles of The George Washington University.”
Hundreds of signatures on open petitions affirm staff, faculty and student concerns. Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education, The Washington Post, The Hatchet and other media have illustrated the profound lack of confidence in GW’s administration.
“Is this who we are as a University? A place in which employees are discarded, faculty are regulated and students concerns are dismissed as if they are kindergarteners?”
It is our hope that the senate will not follow the lead of certain members of the Board of Trustees, who last week lauded LeBlanc’s leadership and then took the unprecedented step of publicly admonishing the SA president. It is beyond ironic and indeed perhaps “incomprehensible” that the Board is seemingly willing to hold the elected student body president to a higher standard than the president they selected and continue to support.
In fact, Board Chair Grace Speights was effervescent in her praise of LeBlanc’s “strong” leadership and “outstanding work,” placing all blame of “divisiveness” on recent SA actions. Contrary to this interpretation, we suggest that the divisiveness began long ago, when LeBlanc’s administration, with full support of trustees, began dismantling shared governance, corporatizing the University, freely talking about shooting Black students and recklessly hiring someone credibly accused of covering up the rape of college athletes.
Now, the divisiveness continues as the Board turns a deaf ear to student, staff and faculty concerns and presents their full endorsement of LeBlanc.
We are further concerned about clear inequities at the highest levels of the University. We find it disturbing to note that when LeBlanc has made numerous, admitted  “leadership errors,”  he was not publicly admonished. Instead, he was afforded the privilege of a private conversation with the Board chair as part of the “remedy.” But when the SA president was accused of a leadership mistake, he gets no such privilege. Instead, he is publicly called out by the Board chair in a meeting with journalists present as if his voice neither matters nor is relevant. This contrast is as stunning as it is disturbing. Is this who we are as a University? A place in which employees are discarded, faculty are regulated and students concerns are dismissed as if they are kindergarteners? All the while, we are told to disbelieve what we are currently experiencing and instead follow edicts that came down from unexplained and unquestioned autocratic decisions masquerading as “strong leadership.”
Do not turn a deaf ear to the GW community’s powerful voice. Do not devalue any of the diverse voices within the University. Pass the censure resolution this Friday to help GW start to repair and restore our vibrant, diverse and creative community.

Goodies Frozen Custard's rum cake is well worth the Metro ride to Virginia.
As fall sets in, I’ve found myself searching for ways to hold onto summer. Luckily, the food truck Goodies Frozen Custard & Treats has me covered.
The 1950s-inspired custard truck is typically located in Alexandria, Virginia, at 200 Commerce St., but check Instagram for the truck’s weekend location schedule before you go. If you somehow miss the joint’s bright red, white and blue truck, you’ll be sure to find it by the long line of people that is typically waiting for sweet treats.
The menu at Goodies Frozen Custard is constantly changing, with seasonal items and daily specials being rotated in and out. But some menu staples include The Boogie Woogie ($8), a sundae with vanilla bean frozen custard topped with pecans and drizzled with chocolate and caramel, and The Big Apple ($10), an apple cider cake donut split in half and stuffed with vanilla bean frozen custard and showered with caramel sauce.
For something more extravagant, daily specials ($10) include rotating menu items – all of which come with a heaping serving of frozen custard – like banana pudding, peach cobbler and apple pie.
The showstopper at Goodies is the rum cake ($10), one of the truck’s daily specials. The dish begins with a thick slice of homemade rum cake that is split open and then loaded with a huge scoop of the vanilla bean frozen custard. The dish is then drizzled with a decadent caramel sauce.
The rum cake itself is well worth a trip to Goodies. It is rich and buttery and melts in your mouth. Somehow it still keeps its integrity when paired with the frozen custard and soaks up any of the melted custard.
The store’s frozen custard reminded me how underrated custard really is. I was blown away by the intensely creamy consistency, decadent texture and flavorful taste of vanilla bean. The frozen custard also balanced out the underlying and deep taste of rum in the cake. Despite a drizzling of caramel on top of the cake and frozen custard, I was surprised that the dish wasn’t overwhelmingly sweet – in fact, it actually had a pretty balanced flavor profile.
The rum cake dish was not only delicious, but it was also unlike any other dessert dish I had ever had before.
For some of the best frozen treats in the DMV, Goodies Frozen Custard is worth the long lines and Metro ride to Virginia.

“You need to take things less seriously.”
“You’re too sensitive.”
“Why don’t you have a sense of humor?”
“I was just making a joke.”
“Lighten up and live a little, snowflake.”
“Don’t be weird or a wise guy.”
“You misunderstood me and over-exaggerated my words.”
“That’s not what I said. And if I said that, you know I didn’t mean it.”
“I’m obviously not a racist or responsible for your problems.”
During my life, White members of my mixed family have minimized their racist rhetoric, shrugging it off as a joke. When I call them out, they shut me down by guilt tripping me and writing me off as bitter and angry. They deflect any responsibility for their hurtful words by changing the subject. They move on as though nothing happened, and I feel unsettled and powerless.
My White friends and family members probably mean well, but they’ve told me in the past they “don’t see me as Korean” because “I speak normally like they do.” They want me to feel flattered that I’m successfully assimilating and ditching anything “ethnic” far behind. It doesn’t stop with my White family – White classmates have conflated “mainland China and Tokyo” when they meant Taiwan. But no one spoke up to correct them. This fall, a White professor lectured my class on the proliferation of Buddhism in Asia and insisted we call the Asian state of Myanmar by its British colonial name – Burma. My professor only confessed to any “controversy” when I told her I met the foreign dignitaries from the region who personally told me Myanmar is the name under which they would like to be recognized.
It gets worse. I’ve watched students and professors in predominantly White classes say they won’t bother pronouncing “far-East Asian names” because they’re too difficult to pronounce. All the while, they’re cracking their tongues into 12 pieces to pronounce supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. They do not grasp these small oppressive issues and fail to acknowledge that their rhetoric is partially why students of color struggle in the supposed free world.
But I’ve eventually learned to speak up rather than stay silent as I’ve done for the past 20 years. I have finally gotten the courage to stand up to White guilt and racist transgressions. And White people must accordingly listen to this constructive criticism and learn from it rather than act defensive.
White people like my family members and classmates, intentionally or not, have historically silenced minorities like me from saying anything remotely “controversial” to keep their white picket fence. They claim ignorance as an excuse for their microaggressions. But the truth is that the American Dream has only been easily afforded to White people, while the barriers for people of color are much higher in comparison. To keep this narrative in their head alive, they implicitly blame the victim as a means to vindicate themselves and discourage people like me from speaking up to challenge their idea.
My entire life and now at GW, I have been told to change core aspects of my identity. I’ve been given suggestions to “romanize,” or in other words translate, my Korean last name “Noh” to something else because it sounds too similar to the common English word “No.” As a result of that pressure, my family traded their Korean last name in for a White American one – “Rho.” This has been yet another way the White patriarchy has given “whitewashing” a comfortable euphemism to force people of color to adhere to their cultural rules. But I will not stand for it anymore, and for the first time in more than 45 years, I am reverting it back and representing myself publicly with my Korean last name the way it was originally written – Noh.
White people, I challenge you to take a moment and listen to the students around you. I notice a sea of White gaggles of people in your Snapchat outings like the cast of “Friends.” I challenge every White student at GW to deeply connect or reach out to a person of color to better understand their unique experience and to listen. Do not make them the spokesperson for their entire race, but instead remove that pressure and hear their experience as just one member of their race.
When someone calls you out for being insensitive, take a step back and understand what they’re trying to say. Don’t act defensive or dismiss it as a joke, but make a genuine effort to acknowledge that what you may have said or done has hurt someone else. Allow people to call out racism when they see it – that brings us one step closer to curbing systemic racism.

Carpenter said “several” of her peers notified her and fellow senators of the post and asked that SA leaders apologize for placing themselves in a two-sided issue.
The Student Association Senate passed a resolution late Monday night urging the SA executive branch to apologize for sharing an Instagram post that supports one side of an ongoing foreign war.
The SA reposted, then deleted hours later, an infographic from the GW Armenian Students Association Sunday that indicated support for Armenia, which is embroiled in an ongoing dispute with Azerbaijan. SA Sen. Kate Carpenter, U-at-Large and the sponsor of the resolution, said SA leaders wrongly inserted the organization into a geopolitical issue by sharing the post and asking for students to donate to Armenian war efforts.
The resolution passed by a vote of 17-4, with one abstention.
Carpenter said “several” of her peers notified her and fellow senators of the post and asked that SA leaders apologize for placing themselves in a two-sided issue.
“A friend that is Azerbaijani had their brother deployed yesterday to the front lines, literally yesterday, and then this post came right after their brother was deployed,” Carpenter said. “That is frankly so telling, to see your school and Student Association that is supposed to represent you, literally support the other side of a conflict – whatever side you agree with, it’s fine but just to see that happen as that student hurts.”
SA Sen. Megan Freeman, GSEHD-G, said she will work with other senators to create a social media style guide to avoid posting about problems that the entire SA does not back.
“There is still further action to follow up with a guide, with another resolution that directly confronts the executive team’s continual inability to post correctly – we will just leave it at that,” Freeman said.
SA President Howard Brookins said he apologizes and takes the blame on behalf of the executive branch for the sharing of the post. He said he wanted to show support to members of the Armenian Students Association, but he recognizes that the SA should not weigh in on “rapidly developing, current situations.”
“It’s a tough decision to be in, to try to support them but also stay out of an issue,” he said.
SA senators also approved Yan Xu, a freshman in the Elliott School of International Affairs and now member of the finance committee; Jack Bloom, a freshman in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences now serving on the academic affairs committee; and Charlene Richards, a political science and journalism major now serving on the student life committee, as first-year undergraduate senators. Senators also confirmed James Setterland into a CCAS graduate senator position and Lindsey Clos into a graduate-at-large seat.

The American Civil Liberties Union of D.C. conducted an investigation into the University’s Title IX disciplinary measures related to a case involving a GW Law alumna, DCist reported late last month.
Dorea Batté, a law school alumna from the Class of 2019, filed a mutual no-contact order with the University’s Title IX Office against a classmate who had been “harassing” her with unwanted text messages and phone calls in 2018, according to DCist. But when Batté applied for the D.C. bar in January, she learned that her order showed up as a disciplinary action against her in the D.C. Court of Appeals, which oversees admissions to the bar, DCist reported.
“It really worried me,” Batté told DCist. “It was starting to get stressful as to what the bar would believe or take into consideration because GW’s supposed to be a very reputable school.”
When Batté reached out to the University, an administrator stood by her bar report and told Batté that she was free to “provide whatever explanation you believe to be appropriate to the D.C. Bar,” according to the D.C. ACLU. Batté told DCist she asked the D.C. chapter of the ACLU in April to convince the University to write to the bar clarifying the no-contact order was not a “disciplinary” action.
After being contacted by the ACLU, Elizabeth Ewert, the law school’s associate dean of students, wrote a letter to the bar explaining that Batté requested the mutual no-contact order, DCist reported. Ewert had originally signed a legal form in January certifying Batté graduated from GW and checked a box indicating that she violated the law school honor code or was disciplined by the University, according to the ACLU.
Ewert had attached a copy of the no-contact order barring Batté from contacting the classmate who allegedly harassed her at first with no further explanation, DCist said. ACLU representatives said they asked GW to reform the reporting process to prevent future students from suffering “adverse” consequences for future no-contact orders filed, but the school would not commit.
The U.S. Department of Education’s new Title IX regulations enacted in May claim mutual no-contact orders are a supportive measure that may be used as an accommodation that does not punish the respondent involved, according to the ACLU.
“But if schools use mutual no-contact orders to punish the complaining student, it will not only fail as an accommodation; it will also chill complainants from reporting harassment at all,” the ACLU said in an article on their website.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal told DCist the University is “glad to hear that this student reported that her individual concern was resolved.” Nosal declined to comment further on the case because she said the University cannot discuss issues involving individual students.
She said officials do not consider no-contact orders as punishment and is no longer reporting them to state bars.
“Mutual no-contact orders are not disciplinary actions, they are not reported to third parties as disciplinary actions and they are not listed as a sanction on University conduct records,” Nosal said in the DCist article.

SBA Sen. Rurik Baumrin said the resolution expresses the body's opposition to the Supreme Court nomination because this act comes during “unprecedented times.”
The Student Bar Association Senate passed a resolution opposing the “rushed” appointment process of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court at a meeting Tuesday.
Senators said the hastened process of President Donald Trump’s nomination – appointing a judge 38 days before the election – will politicize the court and harm the legal profession. The body also passed seven pieces of legislation, confirming students into senate seats, passing legislation to demand “corrections of injustices” at the Title IX Office and remembering a law school student who passed away last month.
SBA Sen. Rurik Baumrin said the resolution expresses the body’s opposition to the Supreme Court nomination because this act comes during “unprecedented times.” He said “only” two other justices have ever been appointed to the court within 38 days throughout U.S. history – whereas the typical process takes 68 days – and neither of those confirmations took place during an election year.
“It really is on us to stand up and fight back against a confirmation process that is going to undermine public confidence in not only the Supreme Court but the legal profession as a whole,” Baumrin said.
SBA senators also passed a resolution in support of a law student who reported cases of sexual harassment on campus. SBA Sen. Sydney Blithman said Dorea Batté, a law school alumna, experienced an “unfortunate” event of being harassed by another student, and the Title IX Office concluded the best course of action was a mutual no-contact order between the parties.
But Blithman said the school disclosed a “disciplinary action” on Batté’s record as a result of her seeking help from the Title IX Office when she attempted to apply for the bar exam.
“It is extremely unfortunate as she was seeking help and guidance and was then ‘disciplined’ for it,” Blithman said.
She added that the resolution also calls on law school officials to create a plan to address cases similar to Batté’s for the future because they’re “unfortunately inevitable.”
The body also unanimously passed a resolution acknowledging the passing of Noah Reisman, a former student at GW Law. The senate also passed legislation thanking the body’s COVID-19 commission for working with administrators during the spring and fall semesters.
Senators also approved SBA Sen. Nicole Karem as the body’s vice chair of wellness and SBA Sen. Breyana Hammond as the vice chair of diversity and inclusion.

Students can find financial holds on their GWeb account. 
GW is increasing the limit for students with unpaid balances to register for classes.
Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz and Vice Provost of Enrollment and Student Success Jay Goff announced Tuesday they will allow students who have unpaid balances up to $2,500 to register for classes, upping the threshold from $1,000. Officials said the raise will provide more financial leeway to students who may be struggling to continue their education because of the pandemic’s impact.
“In these extraordinary times and beyond, GW is identifying ways to demonstrate care for our community and acknowledge ongoing financial complications for students and families as a result of the pandemic,” Diaz and Goff said in the email to the GW community Tuesday.
Diaz and Goff said administrators will also offer a payment plan to accommodate students with unpaid balances.
Students who have “qualifying balances” below $20,000 will have the option to enroll in a payment plan set to pay their outstanding balance over up to 36 months while still registering for spring courses. Student Accounts Office staff will reach out to eligible students, the email states.
Students can find any possible holds in their GWeb account.
Officials decreased tuition by 10 percent this semester for undergraduate students once classes moved online, while financial aid increased by a total of $10 million based on the latest known estimates.
“We are committed to ensuring that students have the resources they need to continue their education during these challenging times,” Diaz and Goff said in the email.

GW Hospital staff relied on "offline record-keeping" while UHS dealt with the attack that also affected some of the system’s clinical and financial operations, the Post reported.
Updated: Oct. 7, 2020 at 5:29 p.m.
A cyberattack late last month that had caused technical outages at the GW Hospital’s majority owner also affected the hospital, according to The Washington Post.
The GW Hospital has recovered from a cyberattack that targeted Universal Health Services, the company that oversees the hospital, and forced many of its operations offline for more than a week, the Post reported. The hospital’s IT network and medical record systems were taken offline “shortly” after the cyberattack was detected and restored this week, UHS spokesperson Jane Crawford told the Post.
GW Hospital staff relied on “offline record-keeping” while UHS dealt with the attack that also affected some of the system’s clinical and financial operations, the Post reported. Staff at the Foggy Bottom hospital were still able to treat patients safely, according to the Post.
Patients’ electronic medical records were not directly affected by the cyberattack at any of the more than 400 UHS hospital locations, according to a statement UHS issued Monday.
“Universal Health Services is pleased to confirm substantial progress toward restoration of online operations across all UHS IT Networks,” the release states. “The company experienced a cyberattack early Sunday morning, Sept. 27, 2020, at which time UHS IT quickly disconnected all systems and shut down the network in order to prevent further propagation.”
UHS spokesperson Jane Crawford said all UHS facilities in the U.S. were impacted by the cyberattack caused by malware, a type of software intentionally designed to cause damage. She said UHS deployed a “significant” number of IT and clinical resources to support hospitals while they restored online operations.
“As of Sunday night, Oct. 4, the hospital’s electronic medical record system, Cerner, was restored and is now operating in real-time,” Crawford said in an email.
