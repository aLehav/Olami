The Colonials needed an injection of confidence.
After a rigorous seven-game stretch on the road to open the season, one that ended with a disappointing 1-6 record, GW (2-6) needed to put a tough batch of opponents behind and look ahead to the rest of the season. The familiarity of the home court provided the jolt the team needed, setting the stage for GW to defeat UMBC 3-2 in the Colonials’ home opener.
“Playing at home is awesome. You have our fans here, friends, family there to support us,” senior Lauren Whyte said. “We knew that protecting our house was definitely a big goal and something that we needed to do.”
The Colonials, who had just completed back-to-back tournaments in Indiana and Wyoming, had a more confident air during their first home match of the 2012 season. Early on, GW took control with a commanding .414 attack percentage to ultimately take the first set 25-15.
But the second set was less sure, a heightened back-and-forth battle until the Retrievers were able to pull away for a 25-19 win. UMBC took the set based mainly on the strength of its defense, hitting only a .211 attack percentage, but holding GW to a .111 attack percentage. Still, head coach Amanda Ault said, her team remained confident on its home court.
“I think it was something that gave us a little bit of a sigh of relief,” Ault said. “Coming home, been on the road two weeks, we’ve had hard competition, so I know that they were looking forward to getting back in here and having their friends and their fans and the community behind them.”
The Colonials got out to an early 8-4 advantage in the third set, forcing a UMBC timeout. The Retrievers rallied to tie the game at 16 apiece, before the Colonials eked out a narrow 26-24 win. But given some momentum with the brief tie, UMBC forced a decisive fifth set with a dominant 25-16 win in the fourth set, solidified by an 11-0 run down the stretch.
The Colonials were not about to be overthrown on their home court. The final set belonged to GW, which dominated with a .556 attack percentage en route to a 15-7 win, sealing the team’s second victory of the young season. Like the win that preceded it, Ault said, Wednesday night’s victory showed a cohesive team effort.
“People have had to step up and play different positions and it happened again tonight,” she said. “I think that they are figuring out that the six people that are on the floor just need to come together.”
As a team, the Colonials had a .170 attack percentage on the game. After the shaky start to the season, GW’s back-to-back victories proved its need to maintain focus on the court, Ault said.
Whyte paced all players with 19 kills, while also adding 13 digs in the winning effort. Redshirt freshman Jessica Lubic had a match-high 51 assists, while senior Candace Silva-Martin led all players with 17 digs.
“Right now we find that we are having a little bit of a roller coaster,” Whyte said. “And I think that all we have to do is just make sure that we tighten up on the little things and keep our energy and focus there throughout the game.”

Fundraising
As the second year of  Patrick Nero’s term begins, the athletic director is preparing to amplify his focus on fundraising efforts.
In his first year in office – largely defined by the ongoing athletic review and strategic plan – Nero sought to create a culture of support and success among all divisions of the athletic department.
“Year two for me will really be spent, a lot, externally doing fundraising. As a department, we have a good sense of where we want to go now,” Nero said. “That’s what the strategic plan was. ‘What’s the vision?’”
Part of the new efforts include the recently created GW Athletics National Advisory Council, co-chaired by New York Yankees President Randy Levine, who headed up the yearlong athletics review. The council of about 40 members will strive to help reach the department’s fundraising goals, which will be set as the Buff and Blue Fund and the advisory council get underway. It will meet for the first time over a two-day period in late September.
“[The national advisory council] is incredibly diverse by sport, gender, ethnicity and age,” Nero said. “We have people that have been out two years, four years. It’s people that were athletes, parents, general alumni that were not athletes.”
The council will work “very closely” with the Buff and Blue Fund, Nero said, a program designed to boost unrestricted annual giving for athletic programs. That fund, also a new measure that resulted from the athletic strategic plan, is in its infancy, but saw strong initial results and positive feedback, Nero said.
Nero traveled to London for the 2012 Olympics with University President Steven Knapp and five other officials in what the administration called a fundraising endeavor.
Discipline
Nero will maintain a culture of disciplinary accountability for student-athletes this year, continuing a policy implemented last year that he called largely successful.
Student-athletes involved in situations that could lead to disciplinary action, Nero said, have 24 hours to inform his or her coach. From there, further sanctions depend on the report from the Office of Rights and Responsibilities, and each incident is examined on a case-by-case basis. The cornerstone of the department’s disciplinary policy is preaching accountability, he said.
“There’s definitely accountability from the student-athlete themselves, and from the coach, and from myself,” Nero said. “We talk about all the time, of holding ourselves to a higher standard.”
Nero said he cannot gauge how his approach to discipline is different from that of years past, under other athletic directors, but emphasized that there is “no basic rule” when it comes to disciplinary action.
There have been “zero problems” with self-reporting, Nero added, after “one or two cases” in which student-athletes didn’t think they needed to tell their coach about a minor infraction.
“We’ve been up-front,” Nero said. “We meet separately with our incoming student-athletes at Colonial Inauguration, and we have this conversation with them, about the importance of representing GW and that they will be held to a higher standard in terms of behavior.”

As fall blows into the District, students will congregate on benches in University Yard and Kogan Plaza. But the crisp weather and sun are not the only reasons students crowd the outdoors.
It is a struggle to find adequate indoor space to study or just hang out, which becomes especially problematic during the winter.
But now that the first floor of Old Main lies vacant due to the Career Center’s move to the Marvin Center, and the former Office of Study Abroad at 814 20th St. waits to be occupied, the University has a chance to reaffirm its commitment to student space by allocating these spots for student use.
Student Association President Ashwin Narla has been lobbying for these spaces to be allocated for student use. He – alongside each of his contenders during the election last spring – illustrated the desire for increased student space on campus while campaigning to represent the student body.
And Narla is not the first campus leader to call attention to this issue. Recent years have seen similar cries from the student body and SA leaders for increased student space on campus.
Last year, the debate largely centered on the Marvin Center’s fourth and fifth floors. The University allocated the fifth floor for Colonial Crossroads and most of the fourth floor for student organizations.
Last fall also saw the Fishbowl on 22nd and G streets turn into University office space, depriving the student body of a small but popular study space. Buildings such as Duques Hall, where students meet to study and work on group projects, are closed to students after midnight.
It is unrealistic to expect a traditional “student union” at the center of campus. Since that is impractical, administrators should take advantage of the open buildings throughout campus, like Old Main and the former study abroad office, for student space.
This move will not only send the message to students that the University is in tune with their needs, but it would also help alleviate some of the space constraints felt by all on campus.
And while it is ultimately up to the administration to delegate the new space as it sees fit, there are a multitude of ways the space can be used that will be in the best interest of students. Whether it is performance space for theater groups, conference rooms for student organizations and group projects or quiet space for students to study, there are various options that will address students’ repeated calls for more places on campus to convene.
Seasons may change and summer will roll into fall, but complaints over space will remain until the University meets students’ needs.

Like many students, I start my day by reading the paper. But unlike most, who receive their news online, I still enjoy holding a physical newspaper.
The Student Association is revoking its subscription to the New York Times, instead allocating funds for other items such as a $10,000 Xerox machine for student organizations to use, according to an article in The Hatchet Sept. 4.
Funding the daily newspapers has become a perennial problem at the University. And just like last year, the Student Association is struggling to find a way to afford it.
The fact that the SA can no longer afford to cover the New York Times subscription is the first sign that its budget has been stretched too thin. This is in large part due to the growing number of student organizations on campus. Now more than ever, the Student Association should use this as an opportunity to increase the $22.50 annual student fee.
And to ensure that we never have to face this problem again, the SA should set aside a specific amount of its budget each year to fund this subscription. We would not have to wade through the fountain of SA allocations each fall if there was already money to support the subscription.
According to an article published in The Hatchet Sept. 8, 2011, “Daily paper delivery falls to budget cuts,” the Collegiate Readership Program was cut in 2007 and 2008 only to be reinstated and finally dropped again last fall.
In 2011, Associate Provost and Dean of Students Peter Konwerski justified getting rid of the newspaper service by citing a lack of student interest in the program. But the argument that students are no longer interested in the free newspapers is simply not true. It is important to offer students who do not pay for an online New York Times subscription this educational resource.
The SA should use this issue as an opportunity to figure out its budget situation before the problem spills over and has damaging effects on other departments and student organizations.
I do not begrudge the SA for choosing to purchase a new Xerox machine this year. It will benefit students. However, the SA must realize that the newspaper subscription is something many students have come to rely on and it should be taken as an equal priority.
I realize that the SA’s subscription to the New York Times is expensive. I realize that it seems like a low priority in a year when the budget is already tight. But this program is essential to many students at this University, and it would be a shame to see it come to an end.

Response to Task Force staff editorial
In the staff editorial Sept. 4, The Hatchet commended University President Steven Knapp for establishing a process to review the Freeh report on Pennsylvania State University as it relates to GW, but also raised a concern that the Task Force was not announced until last week. I want to clarify that after the Penn State Freeh report was issued on July 12, we set up a steering committee that used the summer recess to review the report and develop plans for conducting a thorough review beginning in September, once students and faculty were back on campus. We announced the Task Force at the start of the academic year, because that is when we were moving from this preparatory phase to commencing the substantive work. That work will include engaging many members of the University community.

When Scip Barnhart worked at the Corcoran College of Art and Design, he once invited his art students to meet GW students at his home in The West End. They spent the evening conversing as jazz played in the background.
As Barnhart prepares to leave his apartment in The West End, the community is losing a part of its culture that will be difficult to reclaim. Barnhart is an example of the already established culture that exists in Foggy Bottom and the significant group of residents that often goes overlooked.
As GW changes physically over the next few years, the University should not drive out permanent residents who are an integral part of the community.
After all, how many students really know Foggy Bottom? We call the neighborhood home for four years, but afterward, few students end up staying.
Under the 2007 Campus Plan, the University is set to “Grow Up, Not Out,” focusing on increasing density within its current borders, which puts the culture of Foggy Bottom at risk. Like with all things, there must be a balance.
GW should find ways to welcome residents who are not part of the University but are still part of the community. We should not isolate our neighbors if they are not directly connected to the University.
The University may be trying to preserve Foggy Bottom’s culture while giving back to the community in the form of investments, jobs and new buildings.
But the culture that the University brings to the neighborhood is just that – its own culture. Student and University events, music, art and performances are mostly student-created and catered toward students. We forget about the world outside the University, and we forget about the rest of the residents in Foggy Bottom.
Great strides have been made since former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg’s administration – a period marked by strained neighborhood relations.
Events that the University sponsors, like the FRIENDS Neighborhood Block Party, help bring the two groups together. But the University can do more to make sure that Foggy Bottom residents are not lost in favor of development.
The University should establish some incentive for students to get to know the neighborhood and its residents. Instead of traveling across town to volunteer during the upcoming Freshman Day of Service, students could volunteer at GW Hospital, help serve the homeless at Miriam’s Kitchen or work for the day at the St. Mary’s Court nursing home. They could interact with members of the community who they wouldn’t interact with otherwise.
While the University has come to dominate the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, we are not alone in this community. Foggy Bottom is more than just GW.

If you have yet to venture into Gelman Library, you may have missed the newly installed Colonial Printing system with touch-screen kiosks to print wirelessly.
Academic Technologies and GW Libraries partnered with a service called Wireless Everywhere, Print Anywhere for Gelman and Eckles libraries. The service uses cloud-based technology which allows print jobs to be sent from anywhere in the world to a specific kiosk.
Colonial Printing “is convenient and easy to use,” Michelle Valadez, director of communications for academic technologies, said. Other universities have also adopted the system, she said.
Users can print from library desktop computers, laptops, Apple iOS and Android devices by sending their print jobs to their University email addresses.
“From what I’m hearing, students really like it,” Valadez said.
Before printing from a laptop, users must download and install the Wireless Everywhere, Print Anywhere print driver. For mobile devices, users can download an application from the Apple or Google app stores. USB drives can also be used with the new system.
Each print job stays in the queue for 24 hours.
Single-sided black and white prints are now 7 cents, and color prints are 85 cents. Double-sided black and white prints are 14 cents, and double-sided color prints are $1.70.  Previously, students were charged 9 cents for single-sided black and white prints.
Colonial Printing accepts credit and debit cards as payment methods, in addition to GWorld cards and Wireless Everywhere, Print Anywhere cards.
Once the system is tested, Academic Technologies will explore expanding Colonial Printing to buildings across campus, Valadez said.

Accounts of the blistering heat of Middle Eastern deserts and consequences of combat took the stage Wednesday with author and journalist Sebastian Junger.
Junger, who delved into the world of war journalism in his 20s, discussed his novel, “War,” addressing an audience of more than 100 at Lisner Auditorium as part of the University Writing Program’s First Chapter Forum series.
The program selects one book for the freshman class to read and discuss. Junger detailed the narratives of soldiers and fellow journalists from a civilian writer’s perspective.
After a series of unfulfilling pursuits waiting tables and writing short stories, he delved into war journalism and entered Bosnia during its civil war as a freelance writer with no immediate contacts or experience.
“One of the great things about journalism is you don’t need a degree, you don’t need a certificate, you don’t need permission,” Junger said. “All you need is a plane ticket and a backpack with a sleeping bag. You just go. If you want to report on the war in Syria, all you have to do is get into Syria.”
Dismissing fear as “actually not that hard to deal with,” Junger recounted his experiences as a journalist embedded in active combat, narrowly dodging bullets, encountering the Taliban and, for the first time, witnessing the bodies of dead civilians. From Bosnia and Sierra Leone to Afghanistan, he recalled the experiences and psyches of soldiers with whom he was deeply entrenched in conflict.
“The one thing about war is it doesn’t disappoint. If you think it’s going to transform you in some necessary way, it will. If you think it’s going to be exciting, or is going to somehow make you a man, it will do that,” Junger said. “The problem is it’s also inevitably a lot more than you bargained for.”
Most profoundly, Junger experienced the loss of his fellow journalist and friend, Tim Hetherington, who died while covering violence in Libya. Coupled with the death of Junger’s father, the event catalyzed the renowned author’s decision to abandon war journalism.
“I just got really sad that any of this was happening. It just struck me, ‘What are we doing as a human race?’” Junger said. “Once you connect to that sadness, you’re never really the same again. [War] makes me sad, and I don’t want to feel sad. I’m confident I cannot go back [to war journalism.]”
The selection of his book, titled “War,” came as the number of on-campus student veterans under the Yellow Ribbon Program exceeded 1,000 this year, University President Steven Knapp said.
In lieu of combat journalism, Junger now hopes to uncover what it means to return from war – an experience relatable to the growing student veteran population.
Tommy Davis, president of GW Veterans, said he approved of War as the First Chapter Forum choice.
“It is probably the best snapshot of the war experience itself. He did an excellent job of passing that description on to a civilian audience,” Davis said.
