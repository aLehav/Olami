Norma Lee Funger, the namesake behind Norma Lee and Morton Funger Hall on the Foggy Bottom Campus, died earlier this month. She was 90.
Norma Lee Funger, the namesake behind Norma Lee and Morton Funger Hall on the Foggy Bottom Campus, died in her sleep on July 4. She was 90.
Donna Arbide, GW’s vice president for development and alumni relations, said in a University release that Norma Lee and Morton Funger have been “philanthropic giants” to the GW community for the last 50 years, gifting endowed funds to the GW schools like the Columbian College of Arts and Science, the Elliott School of International Affairs and the School of Medicine. For their donations, the Fungers received the University President’s Medal, the highest honor a GW president can bestow, in 2013.
“Their impact cannot be overstated, and their love for GW and their incredible leadership, support and generosity is well known in philanthropic circles.” Arbide said in the release, “Norma Lee and Morty were among the first donor names I heard even before I assumed my position. She will be sorely missed.”
A Washington D.C. native, Funger contributed to local Jewish, arts, educational and medical philanthropic organizations during her lifetime. Funger was also a licensed real estate agent with Long & Foster Realtors and eventually made her way up to membership of Chairman’s Club at Long & Fosters Realtors.
The Fungers created the W. Scott Funger Memorial Scholarship for the Law School in memory of their late son Scott, an alumnus of the GW Law School, after his passing in 2012. The Fungers also provided funds to support the Music Department and Museum and several professorships at GW.
The Fungers created the Cohen-Funger Endowed Chair of Cardiovascular Surgery at Children’s National Hospital where Funger served as a member on the Foundation Board for 31 years, the release states.
After graduating from D.C.’s Roosevelt High School, Funger attended Syracuse University and Wilsons Teachers College. The release states that Funger was also a member of Kappa Delta Phi International Honor Society in Education at Syracuse University.
Funger served on multiple boards around D.C. including the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, American Art Museum, National Gallery of Art, the Children’s Inn at NIH and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts – where she served on a two-year term after being appointed by former President Barack Obama.
Norma Lee Funger is survived by her husband Morton Funger, her three children Lydia (Bill) McClain, Melanie (Paul) Nichols, and Keith (Mauri) Funger and Holly, the wife of Funger’s late son.

Diaz was intimately involved in an array of initiatives like repairs to buildings and residence halls, consolidating IT, hiring new officials and leading GW through the woes of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Former Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz has left GW after a tenure filled with efforts to alter the University landscape that often brought ire from the GW community.
Diaz, who as of June 30 is now GW’s former executive vice president and chief financial officer, came to GW in August 2018. Diaz was intimately involved in an array of initiatives like repairs to buildings and residence halls, consolidating IT, hiring new officials and leading GW through the woes of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Diaz – who did not return a request for a final interview with The Hatchet – came to the job following the appointment of University President Thomas LeBlanc, who he had served under as a budget and planning officer at the University of Miami. Since departing the University on June 30, here is the history of his time while at GW.
2018-2019 academic year
Diaz kicked off his first year at GW with a series of in-depth tours of GW’s Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses, observing several instances of broken down physical infrastructure that required immediate repairs, like a sewage overflow in the University’s psychology department.
Within his first year, Diaz secured $10 million from the Board of Trustees to make “immediate” repairs and “enhancements” across the University to more than 40 buildings and outdoor spaces new flooring in Mitchell Hall and Potomac House and “enhanced” exterior lighting on the Vern.
Diaz also sought to shake up GW’s financial and administrative structure, hiring a slate of new officials focused on areas like tax compliance, employee compensation, and accounting within his first five months on the job. He also created the position of “chief people officer” in April 2019, who would head the University’s human resources and would report directly to him, to “rebrand” some of the University’s leadership.
In January 2019, he launched a new Office of Ethics, Compliance and Privacy, which reviews many of GW’s risk management and conflict of interest policies.
In his first few months, Diaz, LeBlanc and other administrators restructured the University’s relationship with the Medical Faculty Associates, granting officials the authority to appoint new board members and requiring University approval for its annual budget, but also gave the board “substantial autonomy” to operate on its own.
“We couldn’t see a preeminent medical school without high performing physicians – an academic physician practice group,” he said in a February 2018 interview.
2019-2020 academic year
Diaz continued his work within the academic medical enterprise in his second year by announcing in October 2019 that the University would forgive a $20 million loan extended to the MFA three years earlier.
In January 2020, Diaz came under criticism from faculty over a plan to cut undergraduate enrollment, with some faculty senators saying it would force GW to take on more debt to make up for lost revenue.
The University administration faced backlash for LeBlanc’s controversial 20/30 plan – which called for a rough 20 percent cut in enrollment while upping the share of STEM majors by 30 percent.
However, Diaz’s role as chief executive officer was soon overshadowed by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the industry-wide economic strains that came with it, especially after officials suspended all in-person classes and closed most residence halls in March 2020.
Later that month, Diaz said the GW would halt most of its capital projects and stop hiring new employees, marking the University’s first major belt-tightening policies in response to the financial pressure of the pandemic.
At the end of the academic year, faculty and other community members met the beginning of the budget cuts with concern, over concerns that the University would begin laying off employees, which they said should be left as a matter of “last resort.”
In May 2020, officials announced that most senior officials – including Diaz – would receive salary cuts and freeze all employee salaries.
At the end of the summer, Diaz also slashed dozens of jobs in GW’s information technology office, including its chief officer and put the division under his direct oversight.
2020-2021 academic year
As COVID-19 cases continued to mar the District and facing a seemingly virtual school year, officials were faced with a $180 million budget gap and an estimated 7.2 percent decline in enrollment. Over the next few months, Diaz and other officials would lay off 339 staff at the University by the end of 2020 and temporarily halt base and matching contributions to employee retirement plans.
In September 2020, Faculty Senators passed a resolution calling on officials to maintain salary increases for promoted faculty.
But later that year in the midst of the pandemic, Moody’s Investor Service and Standard and Poors Global Ratings showed confidence in GW to meet its financial obligations.
At the same time, officials rendered the administration’s 20/30 plan was “obsolete” due to financial pressures brought on by the pandemic.
While the COVID-19 pandemic was still raging on, more administrative responsibility fell under Diaz’s purview as the University’s chief technology officer quit two months into his role and Diaz’s office consolidated much of GWIT’s oversight as part of University-wide budget cuts.
At the beginning of 2021, Diaz and other officials began to loosen some of the budget restrictions they had installed at the height of the pandemic, reinstating merit-based salary increases and base retirement contributions in January. In March, officials allowed for matching retirement fund contributions.
In April, a survey of the GW faculty found that faculty members had an “overwhelmingly negative” view of University leadership, with Diaz being mentioned by participants in 62 comments on the survey in a negative or critical light.
Later that month the proposal of the Fiscal Year 2022 budget brought Diaz back in disagreement with faculty leaders, who said the plan didn’t allocate enough resources to research, especially considering many of the delays and decreased funding that took place during the height of the pandemic.
Joe Cordes – the chair of the faculty senate fiscal planning and budgeting – voiced concerns over the size of GW’s $25 million surplus, which they said was in place mostly to appear financially stable for bond rating agencies, especially considering the high demand for increased research funding.
As classes wrapped up and students moved into the summer, LeBlanc announced that he would retire from GW at the end of the 2021-2022 academic year, which he later rebuffed.
2021-2022 academic year
As the long-term leadership and strategic vision of GW remained unclear, Diaz continued to unwind the last of the COVID-19-era budget restrictions, finally eliminating the University-wide hiring freeze in July 2021.
Throughout the next academic year, Diaz would be involved in a number of campus initiatives, including a new $22 million plan to renovate University buildings and increase security measures in December 2021 and spearheading a project to enroll GW students in the U-Pass program, allowing students to have unlimited Metro access throughout the academic year for a flat fee.
LeBlanc left GW in December 2021, leaving former Washington University in St. Louis Chancellor Mark Wrighton as the interim university president for a maximum term of 18 months.
In February, Diaz faced criticism again from faculty leaders over his alleged involvement in a University project that tracked student, faculty and staff movements across campus through the University WiFi system. Faculty leaders said the fact that GWIT and the Office of Ethics, Compliance and Privacy both fell under Diaz’s authority may have made it difficult for the project to have been caught or potentially stopped.
At the end of the academic year, Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights announced Diaz would be leaving his position by the end of June. After Diaz’s departure Wrighton moved many of the University’s divisions – including GWIT and parts of human resources – out from under the CFO to the Office of the Provost.
Treasurer and Vice President Bruno Fernandes stepped into Diaz’s position as CFO earlier this month. In a restructuring of the CFO’s office, many of Diaz’s other former areas of responsibility, including managing communications and additional administrative areas, have been divided up by a string of new administrators, as officials look to shake up some parts of the University administration.

Among a scatter of disjointed headlines, one pattern spilled into this past week. GW has changed its dining hall plans – again.
In a major step back from its original plans, the University announced none of the new dining halls will open by the start of the fall semester, even after officials stressed they would address food insecurity on campus. Meanwhile, interim University President Mark Wrighton made some moves to fortify GW’s leadership, appointing four officials to positions in his administration.
Outside of GW, a storm blew through the District that severely damaged many homes and roads. And in pandemic-related news, D.C. maintains a low caseload, but the rise of the BA.5 variant threatens danger.
Here is the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up:
Wrighton’s hires last Friday featured picks who can set GW on the right path for the future, equipped with valuable leadership experience in higher education and the District. University of Vermont General Counsel Sharon Reich Paulsen will serve as executive vice president and chief administration officer – a new position with oversight of far-reaching leadership of administrative functions. Treasurer and vice president of finance Bruno Fernandes will also take on the role of CFO, carrying extensive D.C. government experience that helped GW secure the U-Pass system last fall. Sabrina Minor is now the permanent vice president for human resource management and development and chief people officer after serving as the interim. And Ellen Moran is now the vice president of communications and marketing after the position lasted two years without a permanent staffer.
D.C. ended its COVID-19 contact tracing program after more than two years due to a decline in total cases and rise in the availability of at-home tests. The District only recorded 281 cases per 100,000 as of July 15, according to DC Health data. As students return to campus within the next month, I hope the number of COVID-19 cases continues to remain low to ensure the safety of the GW community.
Thumbs Down:
Despite original promises, GW announced Thursday that the construction of the three all-you-can-eat dining halls in Foggy Bottom will be delayed due to “global supply chain issues” that will force students to experience the dining halls in a “hybrid approach.” Freshmen who signed up for a dining plan must unfairly switch to a fall semester plan that costs $2,700, even though many other less expensive options exist. Students in all other grades will receive $1,670 in dining dollars and revert to GW’s traditional dining system. While GW’s email attempts to reassure students that their dining balances will update automatically, the reality is that the University took away students’ ability to choose how to dine on campus. The new system hints at better food security with more freedom for students to set their own diets, but the delay only serves up a huge upset for the student body.
The District experienced a heavy and turbulent storm Wednesday, causing more than 230,000 homes to go without power, mainly in upper Northwest. The storm included strong winds, rain and hail that brought down trees onto roads, houses and electric installations. University of Maryland canceled some classes with power outages, and D.C. residents found themselves trapped in cars with trees that fell on them. The D.C. community is still working on cleaning up and recovering as some remain without power still.
Unfortunately, despite a lack of COVID-19 cases in D.C., a new variant BA.5 is still on the rise in the United States. It is the most contagious variant yet and is responsible for over 50 percent of current COVID-19 infections, according to Yale Medical. Just as we prepare to move on from this pandemic, new variants develop and even those who recently got COVID-19 are at risk again. While there is no evidence that shows BA.5 is more dangerous or that it causes more serious illness, we should all be continuing to be cautious and practice preventative measures.

The bread was expertly fried and perfectly held the warmth of the potatoes and channa, which were the real stars of the dish.
Just off the bustle of U Street, the chefs of St. James – a buzzing but cozy restaurant that opened in May – expertly meld modern Caribbean food with the international cuisines that influence Trinidadian meals.
The restaurant, named after a district within Trinidad’s capital, comes from the same ownership as H Street Caribbean street food spot Cane under restauranteur Jeanine Prime. The eatery is only open for dinner from Tuesday through Saturday, but the welcoming environment, friendly service and incredible food make it a must try.
The sound of flashy Caribbean music played throughout the restaurant as I stepped inside, and a charming host led me to my window-facing seat in the front of the dining room with a mixture of tables and booths. An ample bar lines one side of the restaurant, and a second-floor mezzanine in the back provides about a dozen seats that overlook the rest of the building, with green, leafy Caribbean flora planted throughout.
Each table held a small candle in an ornate glass jar, and a small green plate with gold-colored silverware rested at each seat.
St. James’ menu celebrates Trinidadian and Caribbean cuisine, like the Callaloo soup with pureed spinach, chilies and coconut milk, all topped with lump crab meat ($16). Some dishes also honor the influence of other cultures and cuisines on Caribbean foods, like the Pork Pow, which the menu describes as Trinidadian-style Chinese steamed buns stuffed with spicy ground pork ($14). One of the restaurant’s signature drinks, the Pineapple Chow, features Trinidadian rum, pineapple, black pepper and lime ($14) and would certainly pair well with any meal.
By the time the server came around for my order, I decided to try the aloo and channa pies ($12) with a side of coconut rice ($6). Just minutes later, the server brought out the two pies, described as fried bread stuffed with cumin-spiced potatoes and channa, a chickpea-based dish from the Indian subcontinent.
I was, admittedly, slightly nervous heading into the meal because I have never been a sympathizer of chickpeas, but my first bite instantly assuaged any initial concerns about the quality of the meal. The bread was expertly fried and perfectly held the warmth of the potatoes and channa, which were the real stars of the dish. The mashed potatoes were the perfect blend of savory and spicy, and the channa brought an incredible texture and hot, tomatoey flavor to the dish.
The pies, which were delivered on a plain white plate, also came with what the server described as a type of garlic sauce, but it tasted more like pineapple. Nonetheless, the sauce was strong and made for a welcome, though powerful, addition to the dish.
The coconut rice, a side consisting of jasmine rice, lime leaves and coconut milk, was also sweet and offered a nice contrast to the spices of the pies.
I couldn’t leave without a dessert and indulged myself with an order of chocolate ginger mousse ($9), which was honestly one of the best desserts I have had in months. The delectably creamy mousse was topped with coffee cream and chocolate pearls – the latter of which provided a crunchy contrast to the smoothness of the mousse.
I had no idea what to expect before walking into St. James, but by the time I walked back outside into the daily summer storms of D.C., the new restaurant had enlightened me to the delicacy that is Caribbean fusion.

With Student Association members “touching grass” once again and students refocusing on their own summer plans, the uproar over the attempt to force SA President Christian Zidouemba from office is finally dying down. As tensions cool, consider this article a postmortem report on the SA’s latest political drama – an opportunity to diagnose and treat the moribund student government’s flaws and failures.
The SA’s midsummer theatrics began when the executive cabinet voted to remove Zidouemba from his position under Article 15 of the SA’s constitution, which allows the cabinet to remove the president from office when they are “temporarily or permanently unable” to execute their duties. But Zidouemba was alive and well – he even posted an Instagram video in which he denounced the cabinet’s move while at work. In the days that followed, SA Vice President Yan Xu and Zidouemba both claimed the presidency before Xu and Communications Director Aiza Saeed rescinded their votes, leaving Zidouemba in the role of president and putting an end to the brief leadership struggle.
If that’s the story of what happened, then I’d like to focus on what caused the whole mess. Of course there are more immediate explanations – the decision of some SA members to sign a letter calling on officials to fire U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas from GW or an allegedly “hostile” environment under Zidouemba’s leadership to name a few. But the longer story is that, beat by beat, this scandal encapsulates what critics and cynics have said for years about the SA – its poor relationship with the student body, tendency toward bureaucratic excess and meaningless political theater are hamstringing its ability to actually advocate for students.
The fact is that most students aren’t invested in the SA unless or until it’s royally messed something up. An embarrassing, unpopular and unsuccessful removal-cum-coup fits that mold exactly. And when students do engage with the SA to dunk on it and its members, that ought to be a sign that something’s gone wrong. It’s basic politics in which your constituents shouldn’t be more interested in making fun of you than they are voting for you. But the initial reaction to the SA’s drama went beyond urgent pleas to “touch grass” and more crass insults. Confused students also wanted to know why the SA was doing anything in the middle of the summer, let alone removing its sitting president.
Students who largely either outright dislike or completely ignore the SA’s affairs saw an organization without a clear leader – for whom they likely didn’t vote for in the first place – implode before the start of the school year. They had to decipher the SA’s messy bureaucracy and bylaws to make sense of it all. Sure, it’s important to have rules, but did anyone know about the intricacies of Article 15 prior to this whole kerfuffle?
As we’ve learned, members of the executive cabinet ignored the rules – Zidouemba turned out perfectly fine. And while five of the required cabinet positions were present to vote on the attempted removal, it’s unclear if the absence of Keanu Rowe – one of Zidouemba’s two chiefs of staff – invalidated the ousting altogether before votes were later withdrawn. What’s the point of these rules if members of the SA will seemingly sidestep them if or when they feel like it? And in turn, why should students respect the dozens of senators, various committees and advisers and enrobed justices of the Student Court – yes, they actually wear robes! – who write and enforce those rules?
The SA doesn’t really have a “popular mandate,” and its internal sources of legitimacy – its bureaucratic procedures – are meaningless to outsiders and ignored by its members. So what can it do? Besides distributing funds to student organizations and ginning up school spirit, the SA’s role lies in passing non-binding resolutions and issuing statements to represent students and pressure officials. When the SA’s efforts succeed, students have gained things like U-Pass and an expanded SafeRide system. But when it comes to hot-button issues like transphobic tweets or the movement to fire Clarence Thomas that officials are unlikely to touch, the SA largely ends up shouting into the void.
And in the end, that’s what this two-bit “House of Cards” episode is – a whole lot of noise, but a whole lot of nothing. It was instigated by members of the SA who signed a letter that officials were likely never going to consider anyway, an executive cabinet that walked back its bold power grab as quickly as it began and an SA that is now rushing to return to the status quo as quickly as possible. In the end, although with a few firings and resignations, Zidouemba is still president and Xu is still vice president.
The SA may be returning to “normal,” but there is nothing normal about empty grandstanding, total dysfunction and meaningless political theater. The SA ought to stop and think about what they are doing – every member, every aide, everyone. What are you trying to do? And what are you actually doing?
The students of this University deserve meaningful, effective representation. Whether that entails abolishing the SA entirely, reforming it via a referendum or finding new leadership at the ballot box next academic year is up to you. But I know one thing for certain – the SA’s latest scandal isn’t just a microcosm of its failures. It’s the final nail in the coffin of its current iteration.

Framing Fatherhood launched during Juneteenth weekend as a showcase of images that uplift Black men as fathers, brothers and members of a tight-knit community, affirming the joy they share.
Updated: Aug. 3, 2022 at 11:28 p.m.
Black masculinity, fatherhood and joy are on full display in the galleries at the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, where still images capture the deeply personal and often misperceived themes of their manhood as seen through the lens of Black photographers.
Framing Fatherhood launched at the gallery last month, featuring 75 shots from 14 of the most renowned Black photographers in the country to chronicle intimate moments between fathers and their sons in settings like the pews of a church or the seats of the dinner table. Dr. Imani Cheers, an associate professor of media and public affairs who curated the exhibit, drew on the intersection of race, gender, and family structures to illuminate Black males in a light that a more white-washed mainstream media often neglects.
“The basics of boyhood and messages for manhood is an interdisciplinary project that explores the ways in which Black masculinity is celebrated, is represented on, not only through social media but in particular in mass media all around us, the images, names, the things that we see.” Cheers said in a recorded interview played at the exhibit.
The exhibit comes as the first of a larger project by Cheers called “It Takes a Village: Basics of Boyhood and Messages for Manhood,” an interdisciplinary research project that explores the implications of media on the public and mental health of Black men. Framing Fatherhood launched during Juneteenth weekend as a showcase of images that uplift Black men as fathers, brothers and members of a tight-knit community, affirming the joy they share.
“Images of children with their fathers, images of children playing and laughing, groups of men celebrating and embracing – that is what we wanted to showcase to you in this exhibition,” Cheers said.
Cheers first planned to work as the sole photographer for the work but decided to curate instead to give Black men the opportunity to interpret and define fatherhood through their own communities.
The exhibit spreads across the first floor of the gallery, filling each of the walls with portraits framed in unembellished, uniform black frames. While the display is sparsely spread, the Roman-inspired columns that line the entrance to the exhibit provide a grandeur effect that empowers the still images themselves, recognizing and elevating the voices of the artists.
Each artist had their own collection of six to eight images varying in time period, color edit, scene and message. Based in cities around the country, each photographer brought a different perspective.
Some defined Black masculinity through images of men at Black Lives Matter protests to signify their fight for equity. Others defined identity through tender moments of love and affection, from fixing their son’s bike to teaching them how to tie a tie. Several collections displayed modern family portraits, while others showed candid black and white shots of urban life, like children wearing their dad’s hats and sneakers.
Although their interpretation of fatherhood varied, the artists evoked a common theme of Black joy through images of children laughing or men celebrating. The positivity within the stills contradicted the media’s tendency to portray Black males through negative, opposing images of police brutality, gang violence and racialized news headlines. As visitors follow the path of images, each collection presents a different story, allowing each of the photographers to rewrite the narrative they choose to tell.
In one of the most intriguing collections of the exhibit, Anthony Geathers – a photographer from Brooklyn, New York – took photos of groups of men posing together in the street. Despite their stone-faced expressions, their postures leaning on one another soften their appearance and convey mutual support.
The display of collectivism and unspoken loyalty underlines Geathers’ view of Black masculinity. The image proves that a community – even one not bound by blood – can serve as fatherhood can be fulfilled through a community, bending Cheers’ intended contrast from traditional fatherhood in white society.
After viewing the photographs, visitors arrive at two TV screens – one playing an interview with Cheers and the other, an interview with the fathers in the collection. The men answered the question, “What does Black joy mean to you?” and spoke of shifting values, mutual support, celebrations of life and Black pride, which concluded the exhibit with an intimate look into the perspectives that underlined the display.
“We are wonderful, magnificent people, and we just have to keep pushing through,” one of the interviewees said. “Know yourself, love yourself, love others.”
The diversity of images and the various visual approaches to the theme of Black masculinity seek to push back against the narrow assumptions of Black fatherhood that the media often employs. While the experience felt natural and relaxing, the simplicity of the exhibit’s design leaves conscious space for viewers to digest the complexity of the images. This exhibit will engage you with its striking ability to evoke joy, confusion and a loss of words all at the same time.
This post has been updated to clarify the following:
This story has been updated to clarify that the location of the exhibit is called the galleries at the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design.

The DIA Participation Reform Act modifies the assembly's charter to decrease the requirements needed to join the diversity and inclusion assembly.
The Student Association Senate unanimously passed a bill that will expand access to the diversity and inclusion assembly at their meeting Monday.
The diversity and inclusion assembly is comprised of SA Senators and leaders of student organizations working with the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to advocate for multicultural representation on campus. The DIA Participation Reform Act, sponsored by Sen. Henry Deng, CCAS-U and chair of the diversity and inclusion assembly, modifies the assembly’s charter to decrease the requirements needed to join the assembly.
Deng said the bill would allow senators to self nominate, so they no longer need to seek an external nomination. He said now that the bill is passed, nominees only need confirmation from the presiding officer and the chair of the assembly.
Deng said he amended the bylaws to allow more than one student leader per organization to make the assembly “more inclusive.”
“I personally think it is time for us to take steps and hire people to include more people on this mission so that we can have much more power and represent much more people,” he said.
In his presidential report, SA President Christian Zidouemba said he conducted a “total review” of cabinet procedure after the senate’s last investigative hearing on his cabinet, which followed at least seven resignations after an attempt to remove him from the top seat faltered. He said he will begin replacing cabinet members who resigned last week “as soon as possible.”
“I appreciate the feedback and the need for us to be united as one institution to serve the students that have put their trust into us,” he said.
The next senate meeting will be held July 25 at 8:30 p.m. over Zoom.

Speights said officials will likely need to be flexible during the presidential search process because the market for university leaders is competitive due to pending vacancies at other research universities.
Officials involved in the search for the next University president met for the first time to discuss their expectations for the search process, Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights announced in an email to the GW community Monday.
Speights said trustees, the presidential search committee, the faculty consultative committee and the Faculty Senate’s executive committee engaged in discussions led by Ilene Nagel, the University’s search firm lead consultant, during a day-long retreat. Speights said during the retreat she set expectations for the search process and potential candidates and officials in attendance heard feedback from the presidential search firm.
“The sessions provided an important opportunity to build understanding and help us align our views as we share the common goal to attract the best possible leader to GW,” Speights said in the email. “While no decisions regarding the search process were made, the groups engaged in a wide-ranging discussion to hear more about the options for the search process.”
Speights said she began the retreat by affirming that officials are entering the presidential search process without any “preconceived notions” about who the next University president should be. She added that officials discussed how changing enrollment demographics and business model challenges in higher education may impact the presidential search process.
“Understanding the broader higher education ecosystem is critical to realizing our potential opportunities,” Speights said.
Officials selected Education Executives – a California-based executive search firm – last month to guide the presidential search process.
Speights said officials will likely need to be flexible during the presidential search process because the market for university leaders is competitive due to pending vacancies at other research universities.
“However, it was also clear that GW has some unique aspects that should make this an attractive opportunity,” Speights said.
Speights said Kim Roddis, a faculty senator and the chair of the faculty consultative committee, shared feedback on the search process and submitted an initial list of nominations to the search firm. The Faculty Assembly approved the 17-member faculty consultative committee last fall to provide input on the presidential search process.
The email states that interim University President Mark Wrighton and Association of American Universities President Barbara Snyder discussed their experiences as former university presidents and the challenges facing university presidents during the retreat.
“Wrighton, who served as Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis for 24 years, and Snyder, the former President of Case Western Reserve, described their most rewarding experiences as presidents and reflected on the challenges facing presidents today and in the future,” Speights said.
Speights said the GW community will have the opportunity to share feedback with the presidential search committee and the University’s search consultants during the “community input phase” during the fall semester.

Officials said in an email they expect Thurston Hall's new dining hall to open by mid-September.
Updated: July 14, 2022 at 5:18 p.m.
Less than a year after announcing the construction of three all-you-can-eat dining halls in Foggy Bottom, officials announced Thursday that none will be completed in time for the start of the fall semester, delaying the deployment of GW’s new dining plan until at least September.
Officials said the all-you-can-eat dining hall in Thurston Hall is now expected to open by mid-September and Shenkman Hall’s cafeteria is now expected to open next spring, while plans for an all-you-can-eat hall in District House were abandoned last month in favor of a more traditional vendor setup. Associate Vice President for Business Services Seth Weinshel and Executive Director of GW Dining Douglas Frazier said “global supply chain issues” forced the delay of the new dining plan’s implementation in an email to students who signed up for dining hall meal plans Thursday.
“Because we have experienced some delays as a result of global supply chain issues, we will begin the 2022-23 academic year with a hybrid approach to our fall semester dining program,” the email states.
The email also states Chick-fil-A, which left District House in May, will open in the University Student Center in the summer of 2023. Weinshel said in an interview last month that various “mechanical challenges” within the student center caused delays in picking the restaurant’s new spot.
Officials said sophomores, juniors and seniors who signed up for block or unlimited dining plans will be switched to a plan where they receive $1,670 in “Dining Dollars” – funds equivalent to a dollar which will act the same as GWorld funds – for the fall semester. Freshmen who signed up for a dining plan will be required to switch to a fall semester plan that costs $2,700.
“You will not need to make any adjustments in your Campus Living e-Services portal; we will automatically adjust your Dining Dollars for you,” the email states.
GW deviated slightly from its initial plans last month, when Weinshel said in an interview that District House would not be converted into an all-you-can-eat dining hall and instead retain its status hosting vendors serving traditional meals. Officials said in the email District House will offer “stations” where students can order a meal – defined as an entree, side and drink – for $10 at lunch and $12 at dinner.
“Thank you for your patience and understanding as we transition to our full on-campus dining program,” the email states.

Located on I Street across the street from District House, the new location features indoor seating and an outdoor patio for community residents. 
Tatte Bakery and Cafe opened its doors in its new Foggy Bottom location Wednesday. 
Located on I Street across the street from District House, the new location features indoor seating and an outdoor patio for community members and Foggy Bottom and West End residents to enjoy. The new Tatte features a bakery, all-day brunch menu and coffee bar. 
The ANC approved Tatte’s application to open a Foggy Bottom location during a meeting in late February. Brendan Boyle, a representative from Tatte, said during the meeting that the cafe plans on accepting GWorld. 
“We call our offerings’ elegant comfort food’ and its Mediterranean-inspired fare,” Boyle said during the meeting. “We’re a scratch kitchen. We make everything that we serve on a plate, and we’re looking forward to coming into the neighborhood.”
Tatte currently has 19 open locations in Massachusetts and seven in the District, including one in the West End neighborhood bordering Foggy Bottom. Tatte said it would open one more in D.C.’s City Ridge neighborhood by August.
Their menu features Mediterranean and North African dishes such as shakshuka, a tomato-based stew with eggs, and labneh, a strained yogurt. Other popular menu items include their pistachio croissants and signature honey halva latte.
