Alumnus Asher Corson was taken aback his senior year, when he realized local activists were working on community initiatives for longer than most students even attended GW.
Corson is the last GW student to serve on the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission – which advises the city government on issues concerning residents, like traffic, parks, safety and zoning – after being elected as a senior in 2006. He still holds a seat on the commission and is also president of the Foggy Bottom Association, another neighborhood group.
“As I got to know the residents that lived here permanently, I began to feel a connection beyond just being a student,” he said. “A connection of actually being a member of the community. It sort of shocked me at the time, but I realized that coming to GW, I was actually going to a university that was nested within a community, and I was not going to a university that surrounded a community.”
To encourage students to get more involved beyond campus borders, Corson said he supports a group of District students who have been lobbying their peers since late January to apply to fill vacant city board and committee positions.
Student representation on government commissions would bring their personal and academic expertise to the table, Patrick Kennedy, the president of GW’s chapter of DC Students Speak, said. The group, formed two years ago, gathers college students from across the city to lobby for a student voice in local debates.
“It is really about bringing that GW and student perspective to the [D.C.] Council while trying to get as many people engaged in the process,” Kennedy, a sophomore, said.
Boards with vacancies include the Environmental Planning Commission, the Advisory Committee to the Office of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Affairs and the Commission for National and Community Service, according to a list posted by the D.C. Office of Boards and Commissions.
American University sophomore Michael Panek, president of the city-wide DC Students Speak, said students have a stake in city politics, citing recent legislation, such as campus plans like American’s, which is still pending city approval. The proposal is currently stalled in the D.C. Council and, if passed, will end a $338 parking program for students, which would require students to become city residents in order to register their cars to park near schools.
“If we do not go out and show that we care about having our voice be heard, we will not be considered,” Panek said, adding that students at AU and GW typically do not concern themselves with local politics.
Two students from Georgetown and American Universities were elected to their respective Advisory Neighborhood Commissions in fall 2010.
While many college-related issues end up creating conflict between university administrations and neighbors, Kennedy said students represent a unique constituency because they do not fall under either of those categories.
Even though the student body goes through cycles and does not remain constant, Kennedy said increasing representation throughout city government can “create a better environment” for young people living in D.C.

Students called GW’s refocused general requirement courses in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences harder than their other courses, according a University survey to gauge the curriculum’s effectiveness that garnered few responses.
Despite the low participation rate in the survey, administrators praised the emerging results of the revamped course system – dubbed GPAC for its focus on perspective, analysis and communication – which was implemented last fall to ramp up rigor and improve learning focus.
Dan Ullman, Columbian College’s associate dean for undergraduate studies, said other universities usually see students skating through their general course requirements – a trend GW looked to buck. He noted that the school will measure learning goals, defined differently by each academic department, more comprehensively this summer.
Only 30 percent of students responded through Blackboard to the survey, a rate that Ullman said allowed for “a preliminary hint of success.”
“The direct measures of student learning may tell us more,” Ullman said. “But I am delighted to see that the hint suggests that we may be succeeding in our goal of building a challenging curriculum.”
About 6,800 students were enrolled in at least one GPAC course last semester.
Students were asked to rate the course system’s appeal, difficulty and educational value on a scale of zero to four. Ullman, who is also a math professor, said the average rating for course difficulty on the scale was 2.33, slightly above the center mark of being “neither easier nor harder than other courses.”
Economics professor Irene Foster, who has taught introductory courses under both general course systems, said the GPAC system improved communication between different professors of the same courses, requiring those professors to make uniform learning goals.
“We are expecting the intro levels to be more rigorous. This is what the job market is going to be like,” Foster said. “We’re not doing anyone any favors by teaching a watered down course.”
Though each GPAC course looked to improve learning, some students say the requirements are still a lost cause.
“In my math class, everyone was in there in order to get the credit,” freshman Lucy Emery, who has not declared a major in Columbian College, said. “No one in the class was genuinely interested in math.”
The new system, implemented for the Class of 2015, was designed with fewer required courses and more electives in hopes that students would be “challenged and engaged by their coursework from the minute they enter the University,” Columbian College Dean Peg Barratt said.
Columbian College faculty approved the general course requirements overhaul in April 2010, making it the first major change to the college’s core curriculum in 20 years. The change cut the general course requirements from 42 credits to 24 credits and decreased the number of math and natural science requirements.
Students cannot use AP or IB credits to opt out of the requirements.
“While we still believe in a broad liberal education, we also know that students learn the most when they take the courses that most interest them,” Ullman said.

The Class of 2015 is less likely to be attending their first-choice schools, more willing to adopt liberal social views and are focusing more on their studies, according to a January study by the Higher Education Research Institute.
Linda DeAngelo, assistant director for research at the institute and co-author of the study, said students may be choosing to attend cheaper schools closer to their homes over other schools that they would rather attend. About 58 percent of students said they attend their first-choice school, a number that has been declining since 2006.
The survey collected data from nearly 204,000 freshmen across 270 different four-year institutions, including GW. The Higher Education Research Institute, based at the University of California, Los Angeles, researches trends in education, including government policy and facility and staff improvement.
“Attending college closer to home can be considered more affordable for a variety of reasons including just the travel back and forth to the home. Students may also be increasingly making their choice based on the total amount of out-of-pocket cost to the family,” DeAngelo said.
Students in the survey also reported receiving less financial aid, relying more on loans to help finance college. More than 13 percent said they expected to use at least $10,000 in loans to pay for their first year of college – more than double the Class of 2001’s 5.6 percent.
Reinforcing the results of the nationwide report, Executive Director of Financial Aid Dan Small said in October that the Class of 2015 demonstrated significantly higher need than the class before it. The expected family contribution for this year’s freshman class was on average $1,600 less than last year, the largest dip administrators recalled in a single year.
Small said it is too soon to predict the financial need of the incoming Class of 2016, but added that he will work with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to allot money to incoming students later in the spring when most acceptances will be issued.
Associate Vice President and Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Kathryn Napper told The Hatchet last semester that GW was working toward becoming “a school of choice,” but declined to say last week if she thought GW was a first-choice institution for most attendees in the freshman class.
A slight increase in overall Early Decision I applications and binding acceptances for the Class of 2016 indicate steady interest in GW as a first-choice university. Napper speculated that regular applications for the Class of 2016 saw less growth than in past years due to the economy. She cited application fees and cheaper public options as possible causes of the tapering growth.
The study also asked respondents their opinions on social issues, including same-sex marriage, public education accessibility for illegal immigrants and affirmative action in college admissions.
Setting a new record, 71.3 percent of students thought same-sex marriage should be legalized, up from 64.9 percent in 2009.
The amount of students who said undocumented immigrants should be denied access to public education dropped by 4.2 percent over the same time period and the amount of students who supported affirmative action hiked up from 37.4 percent to 42.1 percent – all indications of a more socially liberal freshman class.
The report also found that this year’s freshmen put a greater emphasis on academics than do their older peers. Nearly 40 percent of students reported spending six or more hours a week studying or doing homework as high school seniors, slightly higher than last year’s freshman class, and 3.1 percent more students took at least one Advanced Placement exam.
In 2010 – the most recent data available – 59 percent of GW students reported spending six or more hours studying or preparing for class per week, internal data show. The data includes all GW students and is not broken down by class year.

During a pregame last weekend, a girl asked me which fraternity I am in. When I told her I wasn’t in a fraternity, she tilted her head to the side and said, “Oh. So you’re a GDI?”
And then she walked away.
I was perplexed that our conversation ended with my nod in the affirmative, but it got me thinking about a discussion in my philosophy class about Jean-Paul Sartre and how one creates both his identity and his life’s meaning through his choices. I wondered how, with that one question, the girl thought she knew enough about me to walk away.
Now, her behavior doesn’t speak for the majority of people I have met in the Greek community, but that quick judgment does represent a problem I’ve seen across GW: the lack of overlapping social circles and a reliance on labels to govern social interactions.
Everybody forms social circles – from the people in your hall freshman year to members of student organizations. There is nothing wrong with this, but the identities formed in these groups makes overlap difficult. With limited inter-group engagement, this is a less unified campus.
No wonder students at this school so often feel disconnected.
Right now, each group on campus is operating as an independent Venn diagram, and these differing circles don’t have much overlap.
Having a degree of anonymity at GW  is both a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing when something embarrassing you do while partying goes unnoticed, but it’s a curse when you walk into a friend’s room for a pregame and you have the same conversation with the same people all night.
The reliance on small groups can be solved by opening up social circles. Rather than always attempting to “make GW smaller” through these restrictive, label-driven allegiances, there should be greater macro-allegiance to the community as a whole.
GW students are too often driven to associate strongly with a student organization in order to feel a sense of unity on campus. But whole-campus cohesion is what we need now. By relying on smaller groups, students are cutting themselves off from fellow students and writing people off before they even meet them.
Labels shouldn’t determine groups; they should serve as welcome signs for others. Student organizations shouldn’t drive sharp wedges between others; they should allow others to blend with them.

Last Wednesday, GW welcomed more than 80 different employers and companies to campus to give students a chance to meet recruiters at the biannual Career and Internship Fair in the Marvin Center.
But after scanning the list of businesses attending this year’s fair, I realized there were very few companies where I could apply. Students interested in humanities careers were left wanting, despite being members of the biggest school in the undergraduate community.
For next year’s fair, the University should bring a more diverse group of employers and companies to campus.
Of course, the career fair was fruitful for students in the GW School of Business and the Elliott School of International Affairs, since the event is usually swarming with recruiters from consulting firms and government agencies.
But GW has humanities students, too, and they deserve face time with prospective employers.
Just take a look at some of the names of companies that attended the fair last week. Siemens, The Department of Commerce, Prudential Financial, MassMutual Financial Group and ING Financial Partners were prominently-featured visitors. But where was the booth for an organization like the National Endowment for the Humanities? The Smithsonian Institution? What about the Folger Shakespeare Library?
As a result, students like myself are left to their own devices and are forced to frantically scour the Internet to try to find positions for the summer.
The University could go about remedying this problem by offering a career fair devoted solely to humanities students and students interested in humanities-based careers. As it stands today, students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science benefit from the Engineering and IT Expo, and business students benefit from the GW School of Business Career Fair. Why doesn’t the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences have its own career fair?
The office of on-campus recruiting should make it a priority to connect all students to careers after college; there is more out there than financial consulting.
This situation is particularly disappointing because campus leaders have promised action in the past yet it has never been delivered. For example, as part of his platform in 2011, Student Association President John Richardson said he would improve on-campus recruiting by giving students – particularly those in the humanities – more opportunities to meet with employers. And while it was a noble idea, this year’s career fair indicates that little progress has been made.
Many students come to college so they can get a better job afterwards. As cliché as it sounds, a college education is an investment – one that you pay for in hopes that you’ll receive something better in return. But without an adequate career fair – and a strong on-campus recruiting program for all students – many are left to figure out their summer and post-college plans alone. This has to change.

The campaign season for the Student Association is in full swing.
Every year, a range of contenders vie for the top SA positions of president and executive vice president. Some are experienced Student Association members looking to continue their climb up the GW political ladder, while many are considered “outsiders” who have no previous SA experience.
While the electorate, and the candidates, often focus on their status as SA insiders or outsiders, there are more important factors that candidates should concentrate on.
Candidates must understand that they are lobbyists for the student body – not legislators. Only by working with different administrators and campus leaders will one be able to accomplish his or her goals and initiatives.
While prior SA experience is not necessary to be successful, anyone seeking to make a difference must have a thorough understanding of how the University operates and which administrators are most attuned to certain student concerns. The reality is that it can be extremely difficult to promote change at the University, and without knowing how to effectively navigate administrative bureaucracy, an executive’s advocacy effort will lag.
Student Association President John Richardson admitted to recognizing too late how slowly institutional changes come about in a meeting with The Hatchet’s editorial board this month. Student Association executives only get one year in office to attack student problems, so having a comprehensive plan of how to solve problems is just as important as having a thorough platform. If a candidate only has ideas, but is unable to vocalize how those problems will specifically be solved, he or she is not prepared to lead the SA. Anybody can think of a laundry list of needs for the student body, but not everyone take those grievances and chart how to solve them.
An executive must be able to take student feedback and solidify which issues he or she will tackle at the outset of their term, and should be ready to hit the ground running. Any significant delay in lobbying for specific issues will be a setback for advocacy efforts, as there is only a limited amount of time to create significant change.
Executives must also be adept at gauging the needs and concerns of the student body. Having frequent conversations with a wide range of students and campus organizations will allow an SA president or executive vice president to curate ideas and concerns to present to administration. The in vogue issues of today might matter little to next year’s student body, and executives must be able to finish their problems and tackle new issues without letting any fall through.
When developing a platform and deciding which issues to confront, candidates should be mindful of their unique access to and influence on the University. Almost no other student at the University has as much sway and influence as an SA president or executive vice president.
It is also critical that the president and executive vice president have a good working relationship. Not only is this important for successful lobbying, but it may also lead to a more effective SA Senate. The legislative wing of the SA can be an important mechanism for identifying the needs of specific student groups and organizations throughout the year.
In recent years, women have been notably absent from the campaigns for president and executive vice president. Having a diverse electoral field may shed light on previously unheard concerns, and can draw new students to the electorate. Hopefully this year’s field for the Student Association will be less male-dominated than it currently looks to be and new candidates will bring fresh ideas for the student body to consider.
It is an exciting time for students on campus, but it is also a critical period for student advocacy throughout the University. Hopefully this year’s field will produce an able candidate who will be the leading voice for students.

As I left school after my first day of teaching in August 2011, I said to myself, “When Teach For America talked about the achievement gap, I didn’t realize it was this bad.” My mind began racing through my students’ faces, but one stuck out from that blur of a day.
His name was Malik Billings – a student who only knows Jacksonville, Fla. as the decrepit four-block radius in which he lived and nothing more. He scored a 50 percent on a diagnostic test meant for students finishing eight grade. He was in my 10th grade geometry class.
This injustice shocked me. At GW, I had access to a first-class college education, while just a few miles away, kids in Southeast D.C. were falling further and further behind. I knew I wanted to find a way to help expand educational opportunity for the 16 million American children growing up in poverty. That’s why I joined Teach For America and became a teacher at Ed White High School.
Billings’ story is all too common among students growing up in low-income communities. When kids growing up in poverty enter kindergarten, they are already academically behind their wealthier peers. By fourth grade, they are three grade levels behind. Half won’t graduate from high school, and only one in 10 will graduate from college.
While Teach For America corps members only start by making a two-year commitment, the experience has a lasting impact. As members of our school community, my fellow corps members and I are working with other teachers, parents, administrators and community members toward the pursuit of excellence for our students. I can see the difference I am making in the lives of my students, and I know the transformational impact the program has had on me.
Billings is now one of my top performing students, and I will be there in six years when he graduates from college. He will forever change how I view the role education can have in a person’s life.
For too long, one’s zip code has defined his or her destiny. But with an all-hands-on-deck approach, educational inequity is a solvable problem.
Now that I know we can work to close the achievement gap, I simply can’t walk away from this job. As you think about the role you will play in the broader world upon graduation, I hope you will consider joining me in these efforts in ending education inequality in our country.
The final Teach For America application deadline is Friday, Feb. 10.
