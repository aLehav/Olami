Dozens of religious organizations are joining an interfaith campaign this fall, hoping to revive waning memberships by appealing to a larger audience.
The movement links Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Hindu groups to create large-scale programming with religious speakers and community service, rather than traditional programming, to help groups reach a wider community as they see a crunch in membership.
Co-president of the Interfaith Council Shivam Gosai said groups have been more keen to create an interfaith community as interest in individual religious groups tapers off, boiling down to a core of just the most devout members.
“We’re trying to actually have these faith groups work together, to make strong connections, so the interfaith community becomes important for each organization,” Gosai said. “I think the community service events will be a way to reach out to those who aren’t necessarily affiliated with one religious group on campus.”
Events that focus less on specific teachings or holiday traditions would attract a group larger than the 30-member core, Gosai said.
The transition to interfaith events with a broader scope reflects the direction many groups have taken their programming in recent years, adding an entertainment-focused twists to traditional events. Traditional scripture studies and religious services are among the programs fading out of popularity.
Jewish Student Association president Gabriel Felder said while the student body is about one-third Jewish, far fewer are involved in Jewish campus groups.
To boost interest, Felder said the group has focused more on cultivating “Jewish identities,” through activities like baking Challah weekly at Hillel and hosting new events related to films and art that reflect Jewish history and culture.
“Cultural programming tends to bring in more people, mostly because it involves food, but I like to think we’ve created programing based on what the Jewish community wants,” Felder said. He added that the group was trying to build a Jewish campus presence “that doesn’t end on a Friday night.”
He said more than 100 turned out for their Sukkot banquet celebration, which ended the week-long holiday Thursday.
Felder said the heart of his organization is thriving, with about 40 students expected to attend a Kosher potluck dinner this week. He said it is “not necessarily a lot of numbers, but quality.”
“We’ve drawn in a sort of niche community – a good group of forward thinking progressive participants who want to cultivate a section of their Jewish community,” he said.
Gosai, also the president of the Hindu organization Satyam, said he favors the group’s smaller events. A ceremony to celebrate a Hindu goddess later this month will likely draw about 30 members. He said the group chose to keep the event low-key because smaller events are more meaningful and allow for a “deeper” reading and discussion of scripture.
President of Muslim Students Association Raneem Rajjoub said her group, which has about 20 committed members, will welcome the increase of interfaith programming in the hopes that it will help expands the group’s outreach to younger students who can eventually carry on the group.
And as the other co-president of the Interfaith Council, Rajjoub said she will make sure her organization is actively involved in the council’s community service and “Peace, Not Prejudice” week in late October.
Rajjoub said her organization makes sure its members “learn about other people and their traditions, as well as teach others about our religion.”
The GW Catholics has seen their core of devout individuals shrink, but membership has increased after the group added more community service events, president Justyna Felusiak said. This year, the group – part of the Newman Center – has made sandwiches for the D.C. central kitchen and rosaries for military chaplains.
“Initially when I came freshman year, [the townhouse] was just for Newman events. But now it has turned into a hangout to study and to hold movie nights,” Felusiak said, adding that more and more members see the F Street building as “a home away from home.”
Some organizations say they have already benefited from expanded programming beyond the traditional religious events.
Dignity GW, an LGBT-focused Catholic student organization, has collected a core of about a dozen members in its second semester on campus. Co-founder Blake Bergen said the group will branch out to LGBT film screenings and dinners this year to tap into the broader LGBT community on campus, bringing in students who are not Catholic.
The organization, which studies the intersection of sexuality and religion, hosts events like LGBT Bible study and sometimes brings priests into residence halls to hold masses focusing on discussions about sexuality.
“For us, at least, we are able to attract people who can’t find an ideal Catholic community anywhere else, where they can have those conversations about sexuality and their faith,” Bergen said.
Ryan Peck, president of the Protestant Campus Ministry Association, said his organization has grown since adding interfaith events and community service into the group’s offerings. Peck leads a group of more than 10 interfaith students biweekly in serving at Youth Services Center, an overcrowded detention facility in Northeast D.C.
“People come to college curious, they want to know what’s out there. Part of our job is to accommodate undergrads who are curious about their faith,” Peck said.

Correction appended
The Panhellenic community saw a 15 percent dip in recruitment turnout this year, after its population more than doubled in the last decade.
A total of 610 women went through recruitment this year, 100 fewer than the previous year – a decline Panhellenic leaders say means that the involvement is leveling off after several years of unusually large increases.
The chapters’ pledge classes, which will be decided Monday, will likely be smaller than last year’s average size of 50 people. But Valerie Berg, vice president of recruitment for the Panhellenic Association, said she is not concerned about the Panhellenic Association’s future growth.
“[We’re] back to normal. I think 2010 and 2011 was kind of a big bubble, and it really maxed out our capacity,” Berg said.
Last year, a record-breaking 715 women signed up for recruitment, and more than 500 accepted bids.
She said the Panhellenic Association struggled last year to handle the number of women interested in Greek life, and worried about fire code violations during recruitment and the “overwhelming” size of pledge classes.
Greek life director Christina Witkowicki also said she was not concerned about the decline in interest, and pointed out that some girls may have opted out of general recruitment to join Kappa Delta, which will colonize at GW this year and hold a separate pledge process next weekend.
“We always see ebbs and flows, especially during a year where a new organization is starting,” Witkowicki said.
This fall, Kappa Delta will try to recruit 130 new members, catching up in size to most chapters. Women who want to join Kappa Delta did not register for general recruitment.
Marta Cofone, president of the Panhellenic Association, said she did not think Kappa Delta’s arrival on campus affected general recruitment numbers, because new chapters typically attract upperclassmen, and established chapters saw a large number of sophomores.
About a quarter of potential new members this year are sophomores, up from about 20 percent in past years.
Cofone added that this year’s recruitment held a high retention rate – about 94 percent compared to last year’s 79 percent.
Bid quotas, which are selected on the last night of recruitment, would not dramatically shrink, she said. Chapters that fail to meet quota sometimes charge their members more in dues and look to recruit more women in the spring.
In addition to seeing less interest, the Panhellenic Association is also weathering an $8,000 funding cut from the Student Association.
Last year, the umbrella organization received $32,500, but SA Finance Committee chair Alex Mizenko said he thought the Panhellenic Association needed to use its money more efficiently.
“One big issue is that bills come to [the Center for Student Engagement] at the end of the year, and someone has to pay the bill whether or not the spending was approved. Panhel, and all orgs, just need to be cognizant of their spending. But we can’t keep funding orgs at the same level if they don’t spend their money properly,” Mizenko said in an email.
Even after appealing for more funds, the Panhellenic Association’s final sum held at $25,000, matching the amount that the Interfraternity Council receives.
Panhellenic recruitment began Friday and will end Tuesday.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported that chapters that do not fill their quota charge their members higher dues and try to recruit more members in the spring. This is not necessarily true. While some chapters charge their members higher dues and try to recruit more women during spring recruitment, it is not guaranteed.

The University will give out $50,000 worth of grants to students and faculty for multicultural programming, curricula and research.
Associate Vice President and Dean for Student Academic Success Helen Saulny said the financial incentives could support curricula for new classes with a LGBT focus or hosting high-profile speakers.
The application process will open up Nov. 1.
“The hope is that people will use this grant to think a little outside the box or pursue some things they never had the resources to,” Saulny said.
The program is the first major initiative from the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, created by University President Steven Knapp in 2010 to push multiculturalism. Two years later, GW still lags behind similar institutions in diversity, with 57 percent of undergraduates identifying as white. At Boston and Emory universities, white students make up about 49 percent and 41 percent of undergraduates, respectively.
Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Harris Reed said in September that the program could fund new hires to draft coursework, a class trip to a play with a cross-cultural focus or projects like the athletic department’s recent “You Can Play” video, which highlights coach and administrative support for gay, lesbian and transgender athletes.
“Our purpose is to get everyone on the campus involved. This is reinforcing our message that the diversity and inclusion message for the University is everybody’s responsibility,” Reed said.
A faculty and student selection committee will select grant recipients later this semester. Applicants can request any range of funds.
The initiative will likely continue over the next few years, potentially on a larger scale, she said.
Director of the Multicultural Student Services Center Michael Tapscott said the grants will “open doors” for students to learn about different cultures at GW.
“It just provides some energy to getting more and more people involved, and that’s always a good thing,” Tapscott said. “We have a lot to grow around the diversity world. It’s a great way of encouraging people to look at, consider, explore and experience new perspectives around diversity.”

Jon Stewart and Bill O’Reilly filled the partisan divide with sass and snarky quips Saturday at Lisner Auditorium, rarely straying from their political corners while jousting on the national debt and government spending.
Though the media titans sometimes reach for a common ground in their appearances together, Stewart and O’Reilly found little agreement in the highly publicized debate they dubbed “The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium.”
“I’ve come tonight to plead to the mayor of bullshit mountain. Talk to your people,” Stewart said, standing in front of an elaborate red, white and blue backdrop. “On bullshit mountain, our problems are amplified and our solutions are simplified.”
On national debt and entitlement spending, the duo wrestled over how much to blame former President George W. Bush.
Stewart said talking about the $10 trillion of debt amassed by the end of the Bush presidency put the issue in context, and could not be blamed on Obama.
But O’Reilly snapped back: “C’mon, it’s ridiculous. It doesn’t matter what Bush did. It’s the job of the president now to bring the debt under control. You have to cut stuff!”
Mirroring Wednesday’s debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, talk of domestic issues anchored the hour-long debate.
CNN news anchor E.D. Hill, who moderated what she called a “fight between two teenage boys,” stuck with questions centered around the role of government in the early rounds.
“We’re an entitlement nation. We were born that way,” said Stewart, who stood on a pedestal to make up the vast height difference between the two personalities. “Have you ever seen Oprah’s favorite things episode?”
But while Stewart said the most applause-riling lines, like that “The first sentence of the constitution mentions ‘union’ and ‘welfare,’” O’Reilly brushed him off. The Fox News pundit even pointed out the Comedy Central star’s mix-up of the national debt and deficit.
The two found the most common ground in foreign policy, with both men blasting the way Obama handled the murder of American diplomats in Libya.
In a press conference after the debate, Stewart and O’Reilly said even though nothing in the debate changed their minds on the issues, the discussion was an example of constructive discourse.
But O’Reilly said Stewart had a natural advantage debating at GW.
“I knew coming into a university would be favorable to Stewart, but I also knew the man needs every advantage he could get,” O’Reilly said.
The Rumble offered a limited number of $25 student tickets, which sold out in just hours, as did general admissions tickets in the 1,500 seat auditorium.
It also offered a live-stream version on its website for $4.95, but technical difficulties prevented many from tuning in. Dozens of students took to Twitter and Facebook griping that they could not access the live-stream.
An event official who declined to provide his name said the glitch was caused by high traffic from the hundreds of thousands of people pouring online to stream the event at 8 p.m. – more viewers than expected.
O’Reilly said at the press conference that anyone frustrated by the technical glitch could get their $4.95 back if they wanted.
Profits from the ticket and online sales will be donated to charities chosen by Stewart and O’Reilly, including Project A.L.S., Doctors Without Borders and the Fisher House Foundation.
Saturday’s debate was not nearly the first time O’Reilly and Stewart tangled together onstage. The pair has squared off several times on television, and although their political stripes starkly contrast, the two have developed a friendly chemistry.
The relationship between the partisan foes nevertheless is symbiotic, as Stewart quipped in his last “O’Reilly Factor” appearance: “You love me…you want this date to go on forever.”
Stewart also made headlines – and racked up YouTube hits – when he was on the Foggy Bottom Campus for a taping of the CNN pundit show “Crossfire” in 2004 and admonished hosts Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson for perpetuating a partisan media landscape. The show – and the GW internships and courses that complemented it – was canceled less than a year later.
He also performed at Colonials Weekend in 2009, and joined former President Bill Clinton and other international leaders on campus at the Clinton Global Initiative University conference.

The University plans to launch a website that will break down the new sexual assault policy and available resources.
The website, expected to launch in the spring, will outline where to go for support services, how to report an incident and what to expect after reporting.
Tara Pereira, who oversees the University’s policies on sexual harassment and abuse, said the website, called “HAVEN” would be a “one-stop-shop” for prevention and resources.
“It is meant to be a place where students, faculty and staff can find any info they need, from resources because they are writing a paper, to, ‘My daughter just called me and said she was assaulted, and I’m a parent, and I’m not sitting on that campus, and I don’t know what to do,’ ” Pereira, the deputy Title IX coordinator and director of campus inclusion initiatives, said.
GW’s Sexual Assault Response Consultative Team already runs a website with information on reporting an attack and seeking medical help or counseling, but Pereira said the new website would incorporate information about how to respond to certain situations through multimedia and role-playing scenarios. It will also provide resources to learn about and report hate or discrimination crimes.
Pereira said the website will operate as a separate entity from the response team website with more features, but it will pull information from the group for the sexual harassment sections.
“We were thinking of HAVEN as being more than just sex assault and harassment, but a safe space for all types of discrimination and hate crimes,” she said.
In January 2011, two medical students released a survey that found 74 percent of 1,031 respondents thought the University was not doing enough to educate the community about resources available to victims following a sexual assault.
The University approved a new sexual harassment and sexual violence policy last month, creating a 180-day reporting window during which victims can take judicial action following an assault. It also allows a victim to remain anonymous during the reporting process, which Pereira said helps survivors be in control of their information after coming forward with a case.
The policy also pinpointed Pereira as the go-to official at GW for sexual harassment cases. She said she can put a “face” on reporting to make victims more comfortable coming forward with harassment incidents.
Pereira oversaw the University’s judicial office until this summer. In that role, she spent more than a year creating information flowcharts that helped explain the school’s alcohol and drug policies so students could more easily understand the consequences.
She said GW is using websites, like that of the University of Michigan’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center, as a model.
Michigan’s website incorporates social media components, along with a discussion board for survivors to share their stories.
Holly Rider-Milkovich, director of the Michigan office, helped redesign the website last year to “make [the website] more user friendly and make it more relevant so that when survivors come to our website, they are able to quickly identify resources they need,” she said.
Tracy Cox, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, said sexual assault awareness took to a national pedestal after news broke about Jerry Sandusky at Pennsylvania State University earlier this year.
“This topic has been on everybody’s radar,” Cox said, adding that campus sexual assault statistics are “generally recognized to be grossly underreported.”
“It’s good that [GW] is taking proactive approach to address these concerns,” she said.

A GW adjunct professor is leading the effort to unionize part-time faculty across D.C.-area universities to get a stronger voice in salary negotiations.
With American University adjuncts voting to unionize last semester and Georgetown University part-time professors beginning to organize, GW’s adjuncts would benefit from the citywide effort, adjunct professor of music Kip Lornell said.
“The idea is that once you have an entire metropolitan area unionized, then you have more clout,” said Lornell, who is also vice president for higher education for the Service Employees International Union. “We’re the only area in the country doing this.”
Across the country, adjunct professors typically work for lower wages and with less job security than full-time professors. Their teaching jobs do not include research or participation on university committees, typical responsibilities of full-time professors.
The union would represent about two-thirds of all adjuncts in D.C. if Georgetown unionized. The strategy is partly the brainchild of Lornell, whose role at SEIU makes him the point guard for D.C. adjuncts looking to unionize.
The professor has helped sketch details and negotiate pay for AU’s first union contract, and began reaching out to Georgetown adjuncts this spring. He’s also been on the bargaining teams for all three of GW’s union contracts.
The D.C. area has a higher rate of adjuncts than most of the country, Lornell said, because many part-time professors come from federal agencies and non-governmental organizations.
He said the District-wide strategy would pay off by setting a base line for neighboring schools. For example, he said music adjuncts at AU are paid $45 an hour, but will shoot for the $65 rate negotiated at GW.
About 55 percent of faculty at GW are in the union, and about half are adjuncts at Georgetown and American. Lornell said SEIU would also look to start organizing adjuncts at schools like Catholic University of America and Howard University.
A GW adjunct with a Ph.D. makes a minimum of $4,032 per course. Adjuncts who teach five courses yearly would make $20,160 – about one-fourth the salary full-time assistant professors make on average.
Lornell added that while the average adjunct salaries at schools without unions are unknown, his union’s research showed that Georgetown adjuncts earn up to 20 percent more per course than those at American or GW. If Georgetown’s adjuncts were unionized, he said, their rate could set the bar for other schools.
“They [would] say, ‘Oh if Georgetown is paying $4,500 or $5,000 a class, we need to be paying something like that. We can’t be paying $2,200 a class if our competitors are paying twice as much.’ It’s about setting a bottom line across the entire metropolitan area,” Lornell said.
The service employees union talked quietly for two years about an D.C.-wide effort to organize at universities, Lornell said. But they started pushing harder and more publicly after pro-union steps at American and Georgetown.
Pablo Eisenberg, a member of Georgetown’s part-time faculty organizing committee and a senior fellow at its Public Policy Institute, said adjuncts there have seen a lack of job security, course distribution and office space.
“I think the aim is trying to get a fair and equitable package for adjuncts, which provides them with a better salary, academic rights and management support for classes,” Eisenberg said.
The Georgetown administration sent out a letter last week about the growing campaign, and Eisenberg added, “from the tone of that letter I don’t think Georgetown will fight back.”
If they gather enough signatures, Georgetown adjuncts will hold a vote through National Labor Relations Board. They will need more than 40 percent of part-time professors to approve the union before they can begin contract negotiations.
Adjuncts at GW unionized in 2007 against a groundswell of administrative opposition, including a legal battle. Since then, they have negotiated three contracts to raise adjunct salaries by more than $1,300 per course.
“Since our first round of collective bargaining negotiations in 2007, our relationship with the part-time faculty bargaining unit has been very positive and constructive,” Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Dianne Martin said.
Lornell said the larger issue is that too often administrators point to the minimum rate, which is set in contract negotiations, as the normal pay rate, instead of looking at credentials and experience.
“Our bottom line is that if we’re asked to do exactly the same work and we have the same qualification, we want the same pay,” Lornell said.

GW is offering cash incentives for professors to build courses to prop up the new sustainability minor.
Six professors picked up grants last spring, totaling $15,000 and leading to six new courses in the University’s first cross-disciplinary undergraduate program.
Professors can use the funds to buy books, attend conferences or purchase materials like videos for the classroom, said Meghan Chapple-Brown, the director of the Office of Sustainability.
“The focus has been around getting the minor off the ground, and the introduction course in particular, and encouraging proliferation of green leaf courses so there are more options for students to tailor their minor to the way they want to tailor it,” Chapple-Brown said.
The University will offer five grants for the next three years as its minor gets off the ground and staff shape a long-term vision of an undergraduate degree or graduate certificate, Academic Director of Sustainability Lisa Benton-Short said. So far, the grants have funded five new classes for next spring and one this semester.
She said she hopes the grants will lead to “green leaf courses” – designated courses with an environmental focus – in subjects like business and public health to tie into the University’s academic strengths. GW offers 100 undergraduate sustainable, “green leaf” courses, up from 60 in 2010.
“As a university, our reputation is already that we’re helping to influence policy makers, and so we want to do the same around sustainability,” Benton-Short said.
All professors can apply to add a green leaf to their existing courses if they relate to sustainability, but Benton-Short said the grants will provide an extra incentive to create new courses and feed the minor’s growth. Fourteen professors vied for the grants last spring.
The grants helped fuel the program’s flagship course, Introduction to Sustainability, which filled its 100-seat capacity. It is taught by six professors from across the University.
A total of 22 students have declared green minors in its first semester offered this fall, as of Friday, but the sustainability office directors believe more interest will spring up as academic programs expand.
“We need more teachers – more courses developed, and that takes a while,” Benton-Short added.
One of the professors, Peter Lapuma, also secured a grant to steer a new course on sustainable energy and environmental health that will look at the long-term effects of fossil fuel consumption and alternative energies.
Lapuma said the program is finally taking shape 14 years after since he started teaching a green design course. But he sees the challenges in building up programs centered on sustainability.
“I am not sure I see sustainability as a concrete field,” he said. “I think economics and geology and law are fields of study. I see sustainability instead as a way of thinking.”
Sustainability coursework and programs have been a top priority for University President Steven Knapp since he came to GW in 2007.
Provost Steven Lerman has highlighted the interdisciplinary field, which mixes parts of geography, science, economics, law and public health, and serves as a pilot for more cross-subject courses down the road. The University’s strategic plan, previewed to faculty last week, emphasized more courses that lie across disciplines.
History professor Christopher Klemek is designing the University’s first environmental history class. He already teaches the history department’s only green leaf course – U.S. Urban History.
The new class will include up to 40 students next semester, and will focus on the relationship between human societies and natural systems.
The GW Law School and the College of Professional Studies have also rallied around green programs. The law school nabbed a half-million dollar grant in August to expand its offerings in energy law, and the graduate school added a sustainable urban planning program last year.

It was a win 11 months in the making.
After being ousted by Duquesne in the first round of last year’s A-10 conference tournament, GW was looking for revenge against the Dukes. And despite dropping the first set 25-21, the Colonials rallied to sweep the next three sets and take the match 3-1.
“From the first day of practice – the first day of preseason – this was one of our goals,” freshman Alexis Huntley said. “I think everything just came together finally, and the revenge had a lot to do with that.”
In addition to satisfying last season’s lingering blow, the win put an end to Duquesne’s six-match winning streak and handed the Dukes their first loss of the season in conference play.
The statement victory was significant for a Colonials squad that played through a challenging non-conference schedule, struggling to find confidence through the early months of the season.
“I thought it was huge for us to take out Duquesne, who was in the top two in the conference,” Huntley said. “It’s a huge step for us, and I think we’re really going to feed off of it for the rest of the year.”
The first set in Friday’s match saw Duquesne quickly jump out to a 20-15 advantage, backing up the team’s first-place ranking in the conference. GW fought back though, using a 6-3 run to make the score 23-21, but the Dukes ultimately won the final two points to secure an early 1-0 lead.
Duquesne ended the set with a .351 attack percentage, compared to .324 for the Colonials, which highlighted the high level of effort that both teams would play with for the rest of the match.
“A lot of it had to do with the energy and aggressiveness that we went into the match with and continued to have,” head coach Amanda Ault said. “We’ve had our ups and downs, but we were extremely steady tonight with having the focus – the aggression – and then continuing it throughout.”
In the second set, the Colonials’ energy continued to rise as they opened up the set on a 6-2 run. The Dukes responded to tie the score at 13-13, but GW continued to showcase its improved play, going on another 7-2 run before eventually taking the match 25-22.
The Colonials posted four of their season-high 11 blocks in the set, something Ault said was a key part of the team’s gameplan going in.
“Over the preseason, we were talking about how our blocking was getting better, but then it kind of dipped down a little bit at the start of A-10’s, so this was really good to see,” Ault said. “We were there early, we got up on time and we worked a lot with blocking during the week of practice, so it showed.”
The third and fourth sets saw the Colonials begin to pull away from the Dukes and take over the match. They converted on 73 percent of side-out opportunities in the third, forcing nine Duquesne errors on their way to a 25-18 win.
In the fourth and deciding set, the teams were tied early at 11, but a 14-5 explosive Colonials run closed out the match and gave them the 3-1 victory. Ault praised her team’s well-rounded effort, but she also emphasized the importance of her staff’s scouting and preparations for the game.
“I will always give credit to [assistant coach] Ryan [Freeburg].” Ault said. “He does an outstanding job of breaking the film down, figuring out the scouting reports, what we need to stop, who’s going to do what and giving them a very detailed look at what we need to do and execute. Then, on the flip side, we took care of that.”
GW saw three players record a double-double in the match, including senior captain Lauren Whyte, who recorded 16 digs and a match-high 21 kills. Sophomore Kelsey Newman continued to be a strong force for the offense, posting 15 kills and 12 digs, while redshirt freshman Jessica Lubic paced the team with 44 assists and 16 digs of her own.
Reflecting on the team’s offensive success, Lubic noted its ability to remain consistent throughout the entire match, a key component to the victory, she said.
“Our outsiders were on fire tonight – they were having a really solid game. And then everyone on the flip side was doing everything they needed to do,” Lubic said. “Everyone was pretty consistent all over and taking care of the ball and putting it away when they had the opportunity.”
Friday’s win brings the Colonials’ A-10 record to 3-2. Ault said the team’s improved play since the beginning of A-10 competition has been due to overall increases in drive and focus. But moving forward, GW will need to continue to gain momentum if it wants to be successful in the second half of conference play.
“We’ve talked a lot this week about this being the team we are now,” Ault said. “It can be anyone on any given night, and we have to embrace that and be unselfish about it, because at the end of the day, it’s how the team does.”
