Biden supporters outnumbered the president's outside the White House, first protesting, then celebrating, as millions of Americans anxiously awaited election results.
Hundreds of people have turned out around the White House last week, each carrying their own hopes for the next four years.
Before former Vice President Joe Biden was projected the country’s 46th president Saturday, some said they headed to D.C. to demand a new leader, while others said they hope to preserve the current state of America under President Donald Trump. Once the winner was called, hundreds more flocked to the White House to rejoice, and a handful quietly retreated in sorrow.
The Hatchet talked with more than a dozen demonstrators buzzing around the city between Tuesday and Saturday about what changes they want to see in office and why they took to the streets.
Here’s a snapshot of some of the people who stood out in the crowd:
David Hogg
Diego Mendoza | Photographer
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor and gun-control activist David Hogg said he arrived in D.C. Saturday after weeks of campaigning for other Democratic candidates across the country. He said he headed to the White House that morning, just in time to hear that Biden was the projected president-elect.
The 20-year-old said Biden could still improve his gun reform proposals, but he added that he’s “incredibly proud” he was voted into office. He said Biden has proposed “comprehensive” gun violence prevention plans, like banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
“I think this shows a seismic shift, especially in this election that shows the gun violence prevention movement wasn’t something that just had an effect in 2018,” he said. “It’s something that is still having an effect today and is a winning issue.” 
Jerome Sudi

Artist Jerome Sudi, also known as Paradise Vibing on Instagram, said he’d crossed his fingers for a Biden win over the past week. At the intersection of 16th and H Street, Sudi set up his easel on Election Day and got to work on his latest canvas: a depiction he described as an “anonymous Black figure” knocking Trump to the ground. 
“It’s a play on round two, because round one, clearly Donald Trump won,” he said. “But round two: Hopefully, he gets out of here.”
Sudi added that his artwork can show viewers that corruption in America can be overcome by a new generation. He said on Tuesday that he would continue painting in front of Lafayette Square until a winner is announced.
Kehinde Ogun
Kate Carpenter | Staff Photographer
While the presence at Black Lives Matter Plaza appeared overwhelmingly anti-Trump, Kehinde Ogun of Brooklyn, New York, danced in front of booing crowds with a cigarette in his mouth and flashing a Make America Great Again shirt, which he said was his way to show his “410 percent support for the president.”
Having just been released from prison last month as a result of the Trump’s administration First Step Act – which aimed to reduce recidivism nationwide and lessen the punishment for some offenses – Ogun said he voted for Trump because he believes the president has helped release many other Black men from penitentiaries. He pointed to one report estimating that more than 3,000 inmates have been released since the law was passed. 
“No president has ever done that before,” he said. “This is the best president to serve this country.”
Sam Bethea

As demonstrators unraveled a banner inscribed with “Remove Trump,” Sam Bethea held up his own “Jesus Saves” sign, clashing with BLM activists. Bethea said he has been preaching and evangelizing on the street for six years, regardless of the political climate. 
“We deserve judgment, but I’m crying up for God to have mercy on America,” he said. 
Although demonstrators yelled at the 48-year-old preacher’s face – with some proclaiming he was a “fake Christian” – Bethea said he was confident his faith could reunify the country. Bethea declined to say who exactly he voted for, but he said he supports the candidate with the most stringent policies against issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.
Jessica Senning
Ari Golub | Staff Photographer
Donning a 17th century bubonic plague mask to remind onlookers about the current COVID-19 pandemic, DMV-native Jessica Senning said regardless of who wins, America needs to bring more voices – particularly those of people of color – into office. 
“You cannot paint a Monet with a black and a white – you need a rainbow,” Senning said. “So why are we relying on a two-party system to represent a whole country? It’s stupid.” 
Senning added that no matter who prevails this election, Trump’s attacks on the pillars of American ideals like cooperation and tolerance means this is “the end of democracy.” Senning said she wants to construct a new system where more than one political leader leads to ensure one set of political beliefs does not dominate the country.  
‘M’
Ari Golub | Staff Photographer
Having participated in both BLM protests and riots over the last five months, “M” – who declined to provide her last name – said she demonstrated at the White House to demand that Americans do more than vote to create substantial change on issues like criminal justice reform and voter suppression.
“It’s time to make people scared,” she said. “It’s time to make racists scared. It is time to make corporations scared.”
“M” said she abstained from voting because she believes her vote will not make an impact until the Electoral College is abolished and the country creates a new political system. 
Monte Pearson
Tyara Estrada | Photographer
Like Monte Pearson, some believe the presidency was stolen once before when the Supreme Court sided with the Bush campaign in 2000 and ruled that a timely recount of ballots in Florida was unconstitutional. He said he drove to D.C. from Boston on Monday because he wanted to stand outside the White House and demand that all votes are counted, considering Trump and his allies have falsely proclaimed for weeks that poll workers were counting illegally-casted ballots. 
“We’d rather wait and have every vote get counted [rather] than hurry up and have the election not be legitimate,” Pearson said.
He added that he wanted to protest the Trump administration’s steps to roll back some environmental protection regulations. 
Sarah Robinson
Tyara Estrada | Photographer
After Trump supporters tore down activist artwork along the barriers of Lafayette Square following Justice Amy Coney Barret’s nomination to the Supreme Court, Sarah Robinson said she returned to BLM Plaza every day to paint new banners that now hang along the fence outside of Saint John’s Episcopal Church. 
While she has no formal artistic background, the Maryland-native said she hopes her artwork can “wake up” Trump supporters to the reality of the president’s racially insensitive politics. Some of her newly made signs read “Jail Killer Cops” and “Democracy Rising.”
“A lot of these right-wing people can’t think for themselves,” Robinson said. “Their families [are] teaching them what they are, and they’re so secluded that they can’t think about anything else. And they grow up to be racist and to believe what their parents believe and it gets passed along.”
Rajah Reeves
Ari Golub | Staff Photographer
At the corner of 16th and I Street NW on Tuesday night, Rajah Reeves holds up an “Asian Massage Parlors Matter” sign, much to the amusement of onlookers who stop for a quick picture.
The Seattle-based comedian, who is on the final leg of his “Make America Laugh Again” tour, said he is not interested in politics but rather re-unifying the country through his humor. 
“That’s why I pushed laughter because laughter,” Reeves said. “It’s a common trait that a lot of people do and that can bring people together, not spread them apart because of red and blue.” 
Aladdin Mohamad
Ari Golub | Staff Photographer
While crowds danced and cheered following official reports that Biden had won Pennsylvania’s electoral votes needed to notch the presidency, Aladdin Mohamed stood silently underneath the shade of the Christian Science Reading Room with a sign reading “Trump is a loser.”
Mohamed said the election marked the end of a “darkness era,” adding that Biden is on track to reposition the United States as a credible global ally. He said he wants Biden to reform relationships with countries Trump has repeatedly criticized for failing to financially contribute to international organizations like NATO. 
“We have become the laughing stock of the entire planet,” he said. “The White House has become a circus, but Joe Biden can fix that.”
Ifey Anoliefo
Ari Golub | Staff Photographer
Upon hearing the final results of the election, D.C. resident Ifey Anoliefo said she and her friends marched toward BLM Plaza to be part of a historical moment, adding that Saturday was particularly an important moment for Black women. 
Biden’s running mate, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, became the first female, Black woman and woman of South Asian descent to secure the position. 
“In many years in the past, communities of color – specifically Black women – have always looked toward the future of this country and have made calculations that in the short term, may not have benefited them personally, but basically left the road for opportunity for us to work toward a more perfect union,” Anoliefo said. “I feel like all of our efforts have culminated to this day.”
She added that she hopes the country will move to ensure Black voters are not disenfranchised and that Americans will recognize how Black Americans have contributed to the economy. The Pew Research Center reported in October a slew of policies in each state that suppress Latino and Black voters.  
Kristina Biyad
Ari Golub | Staff Photographer
Defying D.C. open-container laws, American University alumna Kristina Biyad poured herself a glass of champagne and danced to songs like “Celebrate” and “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye” to commemorate Biden’s win just an hour after CNN called the race on Saturday. 
“We can finally begin to restore all of the things that Donald Trump took from us,” Biyad said.
Biyad said she was particularly thrilled that Harris had made history as the first woman of color to be nominated to the nation’s second highest office, which she said was a “historical moment” for minority communities.

In spite of its lower follower count compared to its other social media accounts, the athletic department's Instagram page has generated more interaction than those two platforms since the pandemic started.
The athletic department’s Instagram account has generated more interaction than any other platform since the pandemic hit D.C., according to a college athletics digital firm.
The college athletics site SkullSparks found that the athletic department’s Instagram account has generated the most user interactions among its Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts between March and October. The Instagram account racked up 13,980 interactions, which were measured in likes and comments, in the eight-month period.
Its Twitter account was a close No. 2 in terms of interactions, which were counted in likes and retweets, coming in at 11,050 interactions. The athletic department’s Facebook lagged behind at 4,626 interactions, which were calculated by tracking reactions, comments and shares.
The Colonials’ Instagram account has the smallest following with just less than 3,000 followers. The department’s Twitter account has more than double the number of followers with about 6,200. Nearly 12,000 people have liked and followed the department’s Facebook page.
During the months of the pandemic, the athletic department’s official social media accounts have generated almost 30,000 interactions across the three platforms, according to SkullSparks. Over the eight-month span, SkullSparks found that GW averaged about one photo a week on Instagram, more than 10 tweets per week and about six posts on Facebook per week.
The athletic department sponsored two variations of “Raise High Madness,” an interactive fan-led voting contest, on its social media accounts. The event first started in March, and fans were tasked with choosing the best moment of the 2019-20 season. Athletic department officials said the event notched about 900,000 impressions across its social media platforms.
The second iteration was launched in October and is still ongoing. Instead of sports moments from a specific year, fans can vote on the best GW sports moment of all time.
Men’s basketball’s Twitter account currently boasts the highest number of followers across the Colonials’ sport-specific Twitter accounts. The men’s team has amassed more than 10,700 followers.
An athletic department spokesperson did not return multiple requests for comment about the department’s social media management strategies or initiatives.
But in comparison with other Atlantic 10 schools, GW’s official social media account is trailing behind its conference foe. Dayton, Saint Louis, St. Bonaventure, Fordham and Rhode Island’s athletic departments have all cracked the top-30 in SkullSparks’ monthly social media interactions list during the pandemic at least once.
Dayton led the charge on SkullSparks’ social media interactions list at the beginning of the pandemic, notching about 31,000 interactions from Facebook and Instagram during the month of March. In April, the Flyers tallied about 30,000 interactions from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. About 18,000 of those interactions came from their Instagram account, which boasts more than 23,000 followers.
St. Bonaventure tabbed four top-15 finishes within the past four months, accumulating more than 88,000 interactions in the span from July through October. The Bonnies’ athletic department finished No. 3 three times in that span. St. Bonaventure’s athletic department social media accounts have tabbed more than 10,000 followers, 8,700 followers and 9,800 followers, respectively.
Saint Louis has ruled the rankings with two first place finishes and one second place finish within the last three months. Over the three month period, the Billikens have totaled more than 102,000 interactions across the three social media platforms. The Billikens tabbed nearly 10,000 Instagram followers, 14,000 Twitter followers and 17,000 Facebook likes and followers.
Among non-football schools, the Colonials cracked SkullSparks’ top-130 athletic department social media interactions list only once at No. 112 in August. The Colonials notched just more than 3,000 interactions that month.

This week has been the longest year of my life. 
Time passes differently in a pandemic world. I’m still surprised that five months have gone by since I was first sent home from GW to start virtual classes. Now, I’m on the West Coast still trying to acclimate to online classes, all while following a confusing, tiring presidential election play out on 24/7 news networks. The past week consumed me, eating up every minute of time I could have spent on school work. It feels like a year has passed. Maybe it has – who knows.  
I have stayed up all night checking CNN coverage, only to fall asleep while Nevada took its sweet time to count votes and anchor John King tapped random counties on an interactive map to pass the time. Then, I’d wake up the next morning to find out that some states had flipped overnight. Overjoyed, I’d turn to key races in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate for updates. No, I didn’t really have time for classes. But I tried to juggle it anyway. 
There’s a reason other students and I couldn’t keep up with classes this week. The next president will determine America’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have a say in the overall trajectory of this country. The next leader will set the tone for how the country views basic human rights for people of color and the LGBTQ community. I waited in agony to be assured that Democrat Joe Biden would be that person, and I know others did too. We had midterms, exams and papers that weren’t going to write themselves, but none of that mattered until we were certain that the United States could move forward and finally begin to heal.
We lost hours of sleep refreshing news sites, spending hours deliberating how many votes had yet to be counted and which counties across the country were projected to swing which way. We agonized over which Senate races were going to be called, we debated whether or not Georgia was really going to flip, we laughed about how Nevada slowly counted ballots and we let ourselves be completely consumed by this important election. Some of us asked for extensions on papers or missed assignments and maybe even class as this election was dragged out over the week. Professors probably felt the fatigue, too, as they kept up with lessons while checking the electoral map. 
We were also reminded of the toll of the pandemic, again. The United States recorded record-breaking coronavirus infection rates this week, reaching a new high of 125,000 daily coronavirus infections. Amid an election where many feel as if democracy is on the line, we also had to deal with and remember that we are in a pandemic that is just getting worse. While watching the news and fearing for the state of democracy, half my mind was angered by the country’s pandemic response and the other half was trying desperately to remember what day it was in case I had something due in class. 
While ballots are still being counted and we await a concession from President Donald Trump, I can finally sigh in relief that this week is finally over. Democracy did its job, and we must take our win in stride and rest easier knowing that some of the battle is finally over. It’s time for us to get back to class, turn in our assignments and look forward to a better America. It wouldn’t hurt if professors cut us a break while we catch up on sleep, too. 
Biden is our president-elect and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., will make history as the first female, Black and Asian-American vice president-elect. Our week filled with anxiety, handwringing and stressed out posts on Twitter has all come down to this. 
At the end of the day, this week has been filled with highs and lows and major anxiety for anyone as glued to the news as I was. But the week is over now, we must take a deep breath and remember that we need to take care of our physical and mental well-being. While this election has been all-consuming, seeping into every moment we had this week, we are nearing the end and must remember what it is that we need to be doing: We have homework to do, exams to study for and most importantly, a lot of sleep to catch up on.

Critics of the plan claimed the proposed ranking system incentivized departments to rake in as much funding as possible for the University.
Provost Brian Blake is postponing the development of his University-wide academic master plan following criticism from faculty over a lack of inclusion in its development.
Blake said the plan would create qualitative and quantitative assessments of GW’s academics, but he decided to postpone its advancement after the Faculty Senate executive committee told him “faculty fatigue” was “too high” to start the initiative while the pandemic is ongoing. The move comes days after some faculty began pushing to hold a vote of no confidence, criticizing a lack of faculty involvement in the plan’s development.
Blake announced the suspension of the plan in an email sent to faculty Wednesday, which was obtained by The Hatchet.
“In light of this feedback, development of an academic master plan will be deferred and is subject to adjustments, following further consultations with FSEC,” he said in the email.
When reached for comment, Blake said the now-postponed plan included multiple facets – a senate group to “devise the general measure” and working groups, which drew at least 75 percent of their members from faculty led by a faculty chair, to assess individual academic programs and “glean” opportunities for innovation.
“Not only as provost, but as a member of the faculty, I am a true believer of transparency and shared governance, and I continue to seek input and make changes to plans based on feedback,” Blake said.
“The Faculty Association is gratified that we and members of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee successfully cooperated to force Provost Blake to postpone and redesign his terrible shock-doctrine plan to assess University programs according to an undisclosed return-on-investment standard.”
In the email to faculty, Blake said the 20/30 Plan has been “rendered obsolete” by the pandemic. Officials suspended the plan, which sought to reduce the undergraduate population by 20 percent while upping the share of STEM students to 30 percent, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I have not taken any actions to implement it and have no plans to do so,” Blake said. “The pandemic, though, has created many questions about the permanent changes that might impact higher education, and one aspect of academic planning is trying to explore innovations that respond to those that impact pedagogy and programs.”
The Faculty Association, an independent group open to all full-time faculty, sent a message to its members on Oct. 23 urging them to resist Blake’s plan, which the group said would assess programs’ success based on their revenues.
“He’s using cheap traffic signals to sort every program and department into lanes,” the group wrote. “If a program is a moneymaker – measured by how many students are taught with the least expensive labor – green light! If a program is flush in one aspect but stagnant in another, yellow light! If a program’s return on investment is low on the balance sheet, red light and goodbye! This depressing metric seems to be Blake’s only vision for how to measure program success and failure.”
Blake declined to say if the plan included a traffic-light assessment system but said it would assess programs in areas like reputation, operations and student success.
Harald Griesshammer, an associate professor of physics, began circulating a petition late last month – which has since been withdrawn – seeking to add a vote of no confidence in Blake to the Faculty Assembly agenda later this month, according to emails obtained by The Hatchet.
“The Faculty Code specifies that the provost serves with the confidence of the president and of the Faculty Assembly,” Griesshammer wrote in an email on Oct. 29 to a group of faculty. “We are now seeking signatories for a no-confidence vote in the assembly on 18 November.”
Griesshammer did not return a request for comment.
The petition, which was obtained by The Hatchet, states that Blake’s actions have “eroded” the trust of the faculty, citing recent restructurings of GW’s technology offices and research division.
“The Faculty Senate and its committees, the Faculty Assembly in discussions and votes on 6 October 2019 and 14 February 2020 as well as individual faculty members have made a repeated and reasonable effort to bring the substance of their concerns to the attention of the provost, the president and other stakeholders of shared governance, both informally and formally, without success,” the petition states.
Ivy Ken, the vice president of the Faculty Association, said the petition has since been withdrawn following the suspension of the academic master plan. The group originally endorsed Griesshammer’s petition but supported its eventual withdrawal, she said.
“The Faculty Association is gratified that we and members of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee (FSEC) successfully cooperated to force Provost Blake to postpone and redesign his terrible shock-doctrine plan to assess University programs according to an undisclosed return-on-investment standard,” the group said in a statement Thursday. “We accomplished this by standing together and threatening to vote Blake out of his job at the Faculty Assembly on Nov. 18.”
At the meeting, the assembly will consider a petition, signed by Griesshammer, Ken and 15 other faculty, calling for the launch of a faculty survey about University President Thomas LeBlanc’s “leadership and communication abilities” no later than Dec. 15, according to the meeting agenda. Hundreds of faculty have called on LeBlanc to resign in recent months.
The petition also urges Arthur Wilson, the chair of the senate’s executive committee, to call a special meeting of the assembly to report the survey’s findings. The petition’s signatories said the survey could include questions indicating faculty’s confidence in administrators.
“These might include an indication of ‘no confidence,’ ‘censure,’ ‘approval,’ ‘praise’ or ‘trust’ in the president and his administration,” the petition states.

Now that former Vice President Joe Biden is our projected president-elect, we can finally say goodbye to President Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos-era higher education policies.
Trump, his administration and a majority Republican Senate have already been highly criticized by many Americans this year for their handling of the coronavirus and the funds distributed to higher education institutions. Not only did they not provide enough funding for universities that needed to go remote like GW, but they failed on a larger level to address the escalation of the pandemic. 
Hannah Thacker | Opinions Editor
In addition to the failures of our leadership, student loan debt reached a new high of $1.5 trillion, the second-largest amount of debt next to mortgages. The cost of education keeps going up, and students like us keep taking out more and more money to get our shot at a successful life. 
Let’s not forget about the slew of slaps to the face in academia. The Trump administration imposed a travel ban that negatively impacted our international students, changed Title IX policies to hurt survivors of sexual assault and removed protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients. Higher education institutions now need to repair Trump’s blunders, and Biden can help lead the process to heal. 
“Trump’s normalization of bigotry has even extended to college campuses, with bigoted screeds hiding themselves under ‘free speech.'”
Entering the presidential election and the Democratic primary, a lot of ideas were thrown around about how the candidates would help students if they were to be elected. Former presidential hopefuls like Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., proposed plans to eliminate student loan debt and make higher education free, and several other candidates addressed those issues with varying proposals. The bottom line is that students and higher education need help, so what is a Biden-Harris White House going to do for us? More importantly, what should they do?
Biden entered this race with plans to make public education free for anyone who makes under $125,000 a year – double the amount of money offered by the Pell Grant – improve loan forgiveness for public servants, work to make private loans disappear if someone files for bankruptcy and increase funding and resources for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is pushing Biden to wipe out up to $50,000 in student debt for some people by executive order. If enacted, that order would legitimately be a life-saver for millions of people. Biden could even go beyond that: some have suggested he has the power to wipe out all federal student loan debt with the stroke of a pen. While the details of student-centered policies may vary, the point is that Biden and Harris will have the power to help young people, and they should use that power. 
College students are also dealing with another crisis right now: the pandemic. If the pandemic gets under control and campuses reopen, we just might be able to claw back some semblance of a college experience for ourselves. And if the pandemic’s devastating effect on the economy is rolled back, we have a chance of not graduating into a recession. A Biden administration would actually listen to scientists and take steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 through executive orders around sick leave and economic relief. This would be in direct contrast to the Trump administration’s incompetent management of, followed by abject concession of defeat to, the virus. The last few relief packages were helpful but did not go far enough – the new administration will have the chance to rectify that.
A Biden-Harris administration would also tamp down the vicious tone of politics on campuses and nationwide. Trump’s shameless and cruel discourse toward women, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized groups has percolated down to many of his supporters: it has been demonstrated that many people who had quietly harbored racist and misogynistic opinions have been emboldened to lend voice to them because of Trump. This normalization of bigotry has even extended to college campuses, with bigoted screeds hiding themselves under “free speech.” Unlike Trump, Biden and Harris do not legitimize hate speech or tacitly lend credence to hate groups. Any president will be divisive at times – it’s the nature of party politics – but Biden and Harris will not spur their supporters to chant “Jews will not replace us.”
That same empowerment of racism and bigotry under Trump has also been associated with a broad denigration of education, facts and science. Scientists who plead for mask mandates are dismissed, uninformed hot takes about climate change are considered equally legitimate as ironclad scientific consensus and college education is brushed aside as political “brainwashing.” Biden and Harris have pledged to listen to experts and respect the importance of higher education. As first lady, Jill Biden will bring a background in education to the East Wing, and Howard University graduate Harris will be the first national officeholder to hail from one of the country’s HBCUs. And the new administration has pledged to choose a secretary of education who has experience in education, ending DeVos’ disastrous tenure. 
Between relieving student debt, combatting COVID-19, restoring the economy and fighting climate change, the upcoming Biden presidency has the potential to make life meaningfully better for college students across the country. Young people helped Biden and Harris win this election. Now it is their turn to implement policies that will help us.

While the celebrations over President-elect Joe Biden's victory have remained peaceful thus far, students said President Donald Trump's refusal to concede could spark future violence.
Junior CJ Schor left campus for Colorado two weeks ago under heightened fear that far-right protesters could physically harm her and other members of the LGBTQ community while disputing the results of the presidential election.
Schor, who identifies as genderqueer and gay, said she saw several threats to the LGBTQ community from far-right groups on social media leading up to Election Day, portending violence if President Donald Trump lost his bid for reelection. She said safety concerns ahead of the election pushed her to book a flight home, where she plans to stay for the rest of the semester.
“I knew that it was going to be a lot of conservative people more outraged,” she said. “I don’t know. I guess I just anticipated that. And being a queer person myself, that concerned me a lot, and I think I feared for my safety.”
Students living on campus said uncertainty about the election, its results and potentially violent protests elevated fears leading up to Election Day in D.C. Although demonstrations near the White House remained peaceful before and after President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, students and officials said they rushed to prepare “for the worst” before the final results that many speculated could cause friction and disruption around campus.
“I guess I just didn’t anticipate the severity that they were expecting us to prepare for.”
Foggy Bottom businesses boarded up with plywood as protective armor, and students in the area received an email from officials urging them to prepare for the election by stockpiling groceries as they would for a natural disaster.
With Trump now refusing to concede the race, Schor said she fears his supporters could start pushing back against the results through protests. A woman and two men who identified as members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group who Trump instructed to “stand back and stand by” during a presidential debate in September, were stabbed near the White House during the first night of protests last week.
Sophomore Sabrina Izquierdo, who lives in District House and participated in Election Day protests, said her parents offered to book her flight to her home in Florida after the family received GW’s warning message. She said she loaded up on groceries last week, and her friend bought four cases of toilet paper.
But after spending hours at Black Lives Matter Plaza on Election Day, Izquierdo said demonstrations remained peaceful and didn’t “reflect” the University’s warning that she said discouraged participation in protests.
“It made everyone a lot more worried and a lot more fearful,” Izquierdo said. “When this is something important going on, it’s your decision whether to go out and protest and be in the streets, but I feel like GW just made everyone more scared and turned off everyone from the idea of even participating.”
Izquierdo said she and a few other students joined public gatherings in front of the White House Tuesday from 2 to 4:30 p.m. and again from 8 p.m. to about 2 a.m. – demonstrations she said brought no violence. She said she and her friends brought signs reading “Vote Trump/Pence OUT NOW!” and joined groups of people playing music and dancing in the plaza.
“Out on the street, in general, I felt really safe,” she said. “It was just everyone was so much more interested in just cultivating this kind of unity and this homey energy.”
Izquierdo said the protests did come with some tension, like when a man approached her and urged her to “care for all lives” instead of being pro-abortion-rights. Izquierdo and her friends handed out free masks to other demonstrators near the White House, but many supporters of Trump either refused to accept them or threw them on the ground, she said.
Other than select encounters, Izquierdo said behavior during demonstrations remained “relaxed,” and she noted that nearby police officers remained stationed near their cars and barricades by the White House.
Local and national law enforcement faced backlash for their show of force during racial justice protests this summer when National Guardsmen shot rubber bullets at peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square and ordered helicopters to swoop low above city streets. The D.C. Council passed police reform legislation in June, banning the use of tear gas and “other militarized gear” while controlling crowds.
GW Police Department Chief James Tate said he increased police patrols around residence halls last week, offering students safety tips and “real-time info” on local protests. Tate declined to quantify last week’s police presence on campus “for operational security reasons” but said the department occasionally adjusts to increase staffing by 15 to 20 percent.
He said GWPD maintained communication with the Metropolitan Police Department during the election while monitoring public activity in D.C. and close to campus.
“We’ll do everything we can to keep our community safe by communicating quickly/effectively as the situation develops,” Tate said in an email. “We will work to provide real-time information to our community on where violence is occurring. We will also protect, to best of our ability, all residence halls and safe havens on campus.”
Sophomore Emily Mosley, who lives in District House, said she’s seen up to four police officers at every building entrance during the past week, which she said helped improve her sense of safety during a “nerve-wracking” period of time when students and businesses were bracing for the results of the election.
“It was just really scary,” Mosley said. “I felt like I just kind of woke up one morning and everything was boarded up and they were telling us to prepare, and not that I didn’t expect people to protest, but I guess I just didn’t anticipate the severity that they were expecting us to prepare for.”
After students rushed to the White House to celebrate Biden’s victory, Mosley said she thinks Trump’s supporters and far-right groups might still trek to D.C. to “lash back” if Trump continues to oppose the results through lawsuits and verbal dissent – a concern echoed by extremism experts.
“I think it’s going to get more violent as time progresses,” she said.
