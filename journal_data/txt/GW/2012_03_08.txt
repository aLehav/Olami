Fear is an emotion almost antithetical with gymnastics.
Junior Stephanie Stoicovy embodies this point, her rabid taste for the sport overcomes any nerves she might have – even last year, she suffered a shoulder tear that required surgery. Sidelined for the first five meets of the season, Stoicovy worried about being kept out of the entire 2011 season, but ultimately returned for the last five meets of the year. The beginning of the 2012 season marked her first complete return to a full season of competition after the injury, and Stoicovy quickly marked that return, setting a new career-high in her first meet back.
“I don’t know if I actually had fear of coming back,” Stoicovy said.  “As soon as I found out, I really just got on track to wanting to get back.”
This season, Stoicovy’s taken to the mat to present the best gymnastics of her career. She opened competition at the Lindsey Ferris Invitational Jan. 15 and quickly ascended to the top of the podium, winning all-around individual honors with a career-high score of 38.700.
Stoicovy sees 2012 as her redemption season, a chance to build upon her  freshman year and make up for lost time as a sophomore. Over GW’s eight meets this year, she’s been a consistent force for the Colonials, earning a place on the podium for the all-around in all but one meet.
The day before the Pittsburgh meet March 3, Stoicovy recorded a 9.925 on the floor exercise in practice, and promptly echoed that score the next day to set a new personal record. In the same meet, she also nabbed a second-place finish in the all-around with a 38.375.
Stoivocy is being motivated by the memory of her injury, head coach Margie Foster-Cunningham said. She’s determined to prove that a small setback won’t define her as a gymnast.
“The injury really made Steph dig deep and realize how much she wanted to compete for GW,” Foster-Cunningham said. “She has been a great example of the fact [that] you can come back even stronger following an injury.”
When Stoicovy was relegated to the sidelines as a sophomore, she was stopped from performing for the first time since she picked gymnastics up as a toddler.
Eager to return to the mat, Stoicovy pushed herself in rehab with the help of her doctors and trainers – sometimes so far that she needed to be reined back to avoid further injury, Stoicovy said.
It’s that drive, that passion, that makes Stoicovy such a force to be reckoned with, her head coach said. Simply by virtue of her desire to succeed, Foster-Cunningham sees the junior pushing the rest of the Colonials to raise their own levels of competition.
“Steph is a fierce competitor. The example she has set for the team is invaluable. She displays her desire to succeed everyday in practice,” Foster-Cunningham said. “The difference between Steph and other athletes, is that she practices how she competes. That is more difficult then most people think.”
Stoicovy’s success is a combination of many things, the junior said – time spent rehabbing, experience and strong coaching.  She credits Foster-Cunningham with continuing to push forward to her fullest potential, an effort that inspires the junior to continue envisioning areas of improvement.
Still, gymnastics has never been about personal accolades for Stoicovy. It’s the passion behind the sport, where every time she steps onto the mat, she thinks about who she’s representing and what the routine means to her.
“Each routine is a build off of the one before it,” Stoicovy said.  “When you’re up there, you’re not like competing for yourself, you’re competing for your teammates, your coaches; we’re competing for GW.  So every single skill that you do, you have your team in mind.”

Members of the Greek community are fighting back against a University decision to relocate Greek life staff to the fifth floor of the Marvin Center – separate from student organizations – as part of a broader overhaul of the building’s space.
Leaders of the Inter-Fraternity Council, Panhellenic Association and Multicultural Greek Council are lobbying administrators to remain in their current location with the four employees that oversee the Greek community.
The fourth floor room includes individual offices for staff – which includes two full-time employees and two graduate students – as well as collaborative space and storage that can be used by all Greek organizations. With the move, the student groups will be given offices on the fourth floor while all Center for Student Engagement staff are moved to fifth floor office space.
Marta Cofone, president of Panhel, said the Greek life office needs to be “visible, accessible and open to the average student” to keep up relationships with hundreds of students in dozens of chapters.
IFC President Dan Gil said the three umbrella groups want to remain in close proximity to Greek life staff because the advisers are instrumental in coordinating social and service events, networking with national branches and mitigating concerns within chapters.
“We’re not asking for more,” the junior said. “We just want to keep what we have now.”
The frustrated team of students held meetings with Dean of Students Peter Konwerski and CSE director Tim Miller this week, who gave the student-run Marvin Center Governing Board a chance to rethink Greek life space.
Dylan Pyne, chair of the board, said his group would consider the Greek student leaders’ requests to keep their staff on the fourth floor, while weighing the needs of other student organizations during this year’s office allocations.
The governing board will make decisions about future occupants of the 57 student offices, out of 93 applications, Friday.
Gil said if the University’s Greek life staff is relocated to the fifth floor “in a sea of cubicles,” their relationships with students would suffer.
The council leaders launched a petition last week calling on students to “save the Greek Life office,” which collected 400 signatures in two days.
Greek Life director Christina Witkowicki did not return multiple requests for comment.

The number of students selecting to live on the Mount Vernon Campus next fall climbed by more than 40 percent, a trend the University sees as a reflection of efforts to promote the campus as a destination for students.
Fifty students ranked the Vern as their top choice during this spring’s housing application, up from 35 last year, Seth Weinshel, director of GW Housing Programs, said this week.
He called the trend “significant,” signaling the positive attention the new academic building, Ames Hall, has brought to the campus.
“The campus is more vibrant. There is more happening on the campus now than ever before,” Weinshel said.
Despite the uptick, students still overwhelmingly favored Foggy Bottom living options. Out of this year’s 5,184 housing applicants, just under 1 percent of students selected the Vern as their top pick.
Weinshel said 105 students ranked the campus as one of their top three housing choices this year, about 46 percent of whom are currently living there.
Most of these students designated West Hall as their top residence hall, Weinshel said. The residence hall, which includes a dining hall, gym and blackbox theater, is less than two years old. It includes about 270 single bedrooms in four-person suites.
Weinshel said 10 students opted to live in the all-female Merriweather Hall located on the Vern, which he said was “phenomenal” to see.
In the spring of 2010, with the completion of West Hall, about 100 students selected to live on the Vern, Weinshel said. The figure was an outlier, he said, because there was “so much buzz about the new building.”
In its first year, nearly one fourth of the building consisted of upperclassmen, though their interest tapered off the following spring.
A breakdown of the preferences by class years was not available for this year, Weinshel said.
Upperclassmen who do not rank the Vern as one of their top three preferences are not placed there.
Freshmen are given housing assignments based on available space, which includes Vern residence halls. In past years, about one-fourth of freshmen living on the Vern did not preference the campus as one of their top three choices, Weinshel said, adding that this year’s figures will likely be about the same.
Tim Miller, director of the Center for Student Engagement, said he is not fazed by the slow growth in Vern housing popularity.
As GW continues to expand programming on the campus, like Wacky Wednesday events and theater performances, more students will be drawn to it, he said.
“When [the Vern] is seen as successful, people will want to go there,” Miller said.

Alex Most traded the streets of Foggy Bottom for the hills of Medford, Mass. when the sophomore political science major transferred from GW to Tufts University last year in search of a school away from the city.
“Given the chance to transfer again, I’d take it every time,” he said, joining a growing number of students nationally who pack their bags and switch schools.
Student mobility between universities is higher than ever, according to a study by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, which reported last week that one-third of college students nationwide have transferred over the last five years.
Researchers followed the transfer rates of 2.8 million students from 2006 to 2011 amid the financial crisis, rising student debt, the emergence of for-profit colleges and the growth of community colleges. The study highlighted a need for universities to better monitor and react to the flow of students across higher education.
To make students who transfer to GW feel at home, Associate Dean of Students Tim Miller said he plans to add a staffer to the Center for Student Engagement in the fall to oversee assimilation. Though details have not been worked out, the office plans to also increase funding and resources for transfer activities, he said.
“I want to do more,” Miller said. “Transferring seems to be more of a norm now. Now transferring has less of a negative connotation.”
The National Student Clearinghouse Center researchers – Don Hossler, Doug Shapiro and Afet Dundary – said in the report that if universities can track the detailed trends that follow transfer students from year-to-year, administrators can put policies in place to make transferring less of a burden for universities and students.
GW does not tally the number of students who transfer out of the University, but the number of students retained between their freshman and sophomore years has jumped in recent years, University spokeswoman Jill Sankey said. More than 94 percent of undergraduates who started at GW in 2010 stayed for their sophomore year, an increase of 3 percentage points since 2007.
The number of students who transferred to GW reached 390 this academic year, the highest in four years, and the University projects that it will bring in 275 transfer students for next academic year, according to a May budget report.
The national trends have not translated at GW because upper-tier schools tend to have lower student mobility, but Provost Steven Lerman said a higher number of transfer students could begin “breaking down on the edges” at universities like GW.
“Some of that is healthy. Not everyone knows what they want to do at 17,” Lerman said.
A growing transfer pool could also have implications for the University’s student life, Lerman said.
“The students who do go here for four years do form the core of the most loyal alums,” he said. “They also create the culture more than a transfer student does. A transfer student comes into the culture but doesn’t create the culture the way someone who starts as a freshman does.”
Desiree Jasmabi, a sophomore international affairs major, said her housing assignment on the Mount Vernon Campus made her feel more like a visitor than a student after she transferred from Syracuse University last year. She said there were warning signs at Colonial Inauguration in the fall, which 70 to 100 transfer students attended, along with 300 freshmen and international students.
“We were mixed in with freshmen for CI,” she said. “I felt like we were mixed up and kind of the leftovers.”
Ahmad Mustafa, the Student Association’s director of transfer students who came to GW from a community college in Missouri, said the transfer students he’s met seem happy, but he still believes that “the administration needs to address transfers more uniquely and adequately.”
“The one overarching theme about transfer students is that they’re so diverse,” Mustafa said.

GW is worth attending – and attending again – a recent study found.
The percentage of 2010 graduates who would choose to attend GW if they had to make the decision again rose to 67 percent–the highest it’s been in five years–according to the Office of Institutional Research and Planning. About 20 percent of students said they might choose GW again, while 13 percent said they probably or definitely would not.
GW has made tremendous strides in improving student satisfaction in recent years.
In the last 50 years, the University transformed itself from a regional commuter school to an internationally recognized institution. As a result, the academic quality of the institution has risen dramatically, with stronger students and professors coming to GW every year.
All of this feeds into student satisfaction and happiness at the University, and it will continue to do so in the future.
With endeavors such as developing a new, long-term academic strategic plan, the University is clearly creating the academic infrastructure for student satisfaction. But there is another element of the institution that might be even more critical to propel student satisfaction forward: the small, yet important details of campus and residential life at GW.
What can often be an overlooked element of student satisfaction is the day-to-day interaction that the student body has with the institution. For the vast majority of students, having a positive campus and residential experience is the most important aspect of college.
Students remember unanswered FIXit requests. They remember the frustration of dealing with Student Technology Services when their Internet connection is slow or nonexistent. And they can’t reclaim the lost time that it takes to weave through a seemingly endless maze of bureaucratic red tape to discuss their financial aid package.
And ultimately, it can be these seemingly minute dealings that can define an individual’s experience at GW.
It might be unfair that students often assess the entire University based on these small interactions, but they do add up. The truth is, students want to feel served by the University.
And bureaucracy, inaccessibility and a lack of transparency thwart that.
The best way the University can ensure it is providing students with a strong campus and residential experience is by allowing for frequent and open lines of communication.
The University should constantly seek feedback regarding the different offices, departments and services that students use. This will help the administration understand the concerns students may have about different aspects of GW.
If students are frustrated with certain issues, it is in the University’s best interests to communicate what exactly is being done to alleviate any problems. Students want to know GW can be responsive and versatile, and that it is not the bureaucratic monstrosity it is often portrayed to be.
When students encounter issues with academics or student life –  and they inevitably will at some point during their college careers – they want to feel they are informed about the right office or administrator to contact. By making it clear which department or individual can best help with a particular issue, students will feel that they are able to navigate the University.
As the University continues to grow and expand, it can never forget what makes graduates truly happy that they spent four years as a Colonial.

It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words.
Despite the old adage, sometimes words are needed to fully appreciate the hidden subtleties in art.  This was the concept behind “A Person and a Story,” a show which opened Feb. 29 at the Studio Gallery in Dupont Circle.
Each of the six local photographers featured was asked to select two favorite portraits and tell the stories behind them. The gallery then displayed both the portraits and explanations side-by-side, creating a more holistic content for the viewer.
Fawna Xiao, the director of the Studio Gallery and curator for the show said the stories added a new layers to the photographs.
“People find portraits kind of boring, because they don’t know the person – they don’t understand the relationship between the photographer and the subject,” Xiao said.
The portraits Jim Darling selected are similar in their simplicity. While both are close up shots of the subjects in front of simple backgrounds, his descriptions reveal his more complicated methods.
His first piece, “Jeffrey,” is the portrait of a homeless man who sleeps at the photographer’s local bus stop.
“Normally I don’t have a problem approaching a complete stranger to ask them for a photo, but Jeffery…was different,” Darling wrote in his accompanying story. “It was in the CVS where I first noticed him – reading a newspaper aloud. And I, like most of my neighbors, avoided him at first, either out of fear or just simply not understanding his mental disability. But I always wanted to photograph him.”
Over several months, Darling and Jeffrey established, through nods and smiles, a silent friendship between the two men. Darling felt the rapport was necessary before asking for his portrait, and once he did, the results are revealed through the honesty of the picture.
Darling took a more conventional, static approach when he photographed Lori, the subject of his second piece, “The Lady.” Lori was a participant in the Seersucker Social, a bike ride for lovers of vintage fashion that has become a D.C. tradition.
“I was sweaty, tired and just spent 15 miles on a bicycle when asked to pose for a portrait,” she explained in the description. “And not like an action portrait, but one of those lovely kind where afterward everyone says, ‘Wow, you look beautiful.’”
Her hair is pulled back into a white, wide-brimmed hat, revealing a delicate collarbone. Her expression conveys a child-like innocence despite her reservations.
“They are almost complete opposites in every way. Where ‘The Lady’ is soft and beautiful, ‘Jeffrey’ is hard and weathered,” Darling said.
Darling explained that the pairing of pictures and words adds to the viewer’s understanding.
“When you include the story of the image, you are giving the viewer insight into the photographer’s mind and thoughts behind why he took the photo, what it means to him and in a way, how he wants you to feel,” Darling said.
While some of the photographers used their own words to tell the stories behind the portraits, artist David Lee preferred to let his subjects do the explaining.
His first picture, “9:50 AM | January 20, 2009 | Washington, DC,” depicts Barack Obama and George W. Bush exiting the White House on the day of Obama’s inauguration. Lee used an excerpt from Obama’s inauguration speech as the portrait’s description.
The second photo reveals a man who received a heart transplant, changing not only his life, but also the lives of his family and friends, Lee explained.
“I was fascinated on the idea of hope,” Lee said of both photos.
“Here is one man who campaigned on the promise of a better tomorrow for millions and here is another man who waits for the gift of life,” Lee said.
The exhibit is on display at the Studio Gallery located at 2108 R St. through March 24.

In the past two months, Sleigh Bells has graced the pages of GQ and performed on “Saturday Night Live” – two clear indicators the pop-electro rockers have truly made it. Some call them noise-pop, some nu metal and some say they’re just loud, but it’s clear the duo has a good thing going. Comprised of multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and producer Derek Edward Miller and songwriter-vocalist Alexis Krauss, Sleigh Bells produces infectious beats and riff-driven tunes that hit the scene hard this winter. The group’s most recent effort, “Reign of Terror” is a unique album. Many of the songs essentially have no chorus, making it a bit difficult to sing along, but the group’s upbeat style is perfect for letting loose. Sleigh Bells’ live shows are even more intense than their albums, with stacks of Marshall amps dominating the stage and Krauss tearing it up in her trademark white Keds. If you’re trying to have a wild night filled with dancing and screaming followed by temporary hearing loss, this is the show for you.
Score: They’re just wild. Expect to dance your face off and have an amazing time doing it.
Bore: No one has any idea what they are saying. This is definitely not a concert where you can sing along. Also, it’s going to get sweaty.

They’re folk rockers from Iceland; that alone is awesome. Then you hear the music. The lush blend of instruments has a percussive drive to it, with a combination of vocalists that led the group to win the national Icelandic battle of the bands in 2010. Drawing comparisons to Mumford & Sons and Arcade Fire, the six-piece group is the darlings of the NPR crowd. With a homey and friendly look that is simply welcoming, Of Monsters and Men makes you feel like the music was written for you to enjoy it in that moment – a special feeling in today’s world of overproduced jams. The show is sold out, but you should be able to score some tickets on Craigslist.
Score: Icelandic folk rock – really, what more can you say?
Bore: Aside from “Little Talks,” the album hasn’t really made waves.
March 10
Stephen Kellogg & The Sixers is one of the most dedicated touring bands around. End of discussion. The group has played more than 1,000 shows on the road and the combined sum of the members’ released albums is over 20. This live show is second to none – filled with humor, wonderful anecdotes and more importantly, timeless music that is honest and soulful. The group released its most recent album, “Gift Horse,” last October, and it’s a disc that was made for small, intimate rooms. Kellogg’s lyrics are intensely personal, dealing with love, loss, the highest highs and the deepest lows. From attending many of the group’s shows, I can attest to the power of intimacy. This is a show you won’t want to miss.
Score: Professionals with the heart to back it up. The little band that could is at it again.
Bore: The group’s older work is even more beautiful. It will be a shame if they don’t play it.

The University’s admissions office is normally calm, but as the acceptance deadline nears, it is bustling with activity.
More than 30 admissions officers have read about 21,600 undergraduate applications over the past two and a half months, shaping the Class of 2016 until letters of acceptance go out at the end of this month.
Their job is a cyclical one, a process that requires each reader to examine about 1,000 applications annually. Half of their year is spent trekking across the world, reaching out to prospective students. The other half is spent on campus or at home, reviewing final applications. Days after spring break ends, the cycle will start over.
The admissions team hand-picked more than 7,100 applicants last year, yielding an incoming freshman class of about 2,400 students last fall.
During reading season, admission officers spend eight hours per day scouring applications and writing up reports of each potential student, including their recommendation for each admission decision.
Senior Assistant Director of Admissions Dan Miller, who has reviewed applications for six years, said he reads the academic transcript and guidance counselor recommendation first. Alex Trempus, assistant director of undergraduate admissions who is currently in his second year of reading, said he prefers starting with the personal essay.
“Putting a voice to the application before you start getting all of the nitty-gritty information can be really nice because it puts all of the quantifiable information in context,” Trempus said.
As reading season comes to a close this week, a committee made up of the officer who reviewed the application and two senior staffers deliberates over each applicant, with the reader advocating for the student he or she believes should be accepted.
Associate Vice President and Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Kathryn Napper said the goal of the process is to understand how a student would fit into the incoming class and the University community as a whole.
“It’s an art, choosing which students attend,” Napper said.
The number of undergraduate applications is up 100 students from last year – 100 more hours of work for the admissions staff.
Market basket schools saw varying degrees of growth this year. Boston and Northwestern universities saw larger increases, while Syracuse University’s small bump matched GW’s numbers more closely.
Jeffrey Yu, an applicant for the class of 2016, is relying on his extracurricular activities and life experience to set him apart.
“I think the whole idea that, if you can get a certain score, you’ll be accepted is totally irrelevant in today’s college application process,” Yu said.
He emphasized his varsity soccer experience and student government position in his GW application.
Jeannie Borin, founder and president of College Connections, a college admission counseling service, said schools prioritize parts of an application over others.  She said that colleges want to see the academic credentials that qualify them for admission first, and then build a more personal vision of students based on their essay and recommendations.
Borin said that students should use their applications to demonstrate uniqueness, which admissions officers look for to “build a well-rounded class.”
After decision letters go out in late March, Trempus said he looks forward to visit days, when he can recognize students whose applications he read. He recalled meeting an applicant on campus after she had driven four hours each way for an admissions interview with him in rural Kansas.
“It was so exciting to see her here, and to see her realize that this was the perfect fit for her on that April visit,” Trempus said.
One applicant who discussed how she came to understand her deceased grandmother through her recipe collection stuck out to Senior Associate Director of Undergraduate Admissions Touran Waters, who said she feels invested in the students whose applications she has read over the last 19 years.
“The next step is them accepting our offer. You’re inviting them, and you want them to come because you talked about them, you’ve read about them, you like them so much,” Waters said. “The process doesn’t end when we admit them, the process ends when they’ve accepted.”
