When students want a spot to meet up during the day, do some reading between classes or get together to recount the previous weekend night’s debauchery, they can only really choose among a few campus spots: Gelman Starbucks, Ivory Tower basement, the first floor of the Marvin Center or the single bench next to the GW Deli.
Don’t let the choices overwhelm you.
The University wants to improve student morale and foster a sense of lifetime Colonials pride with efforts such as forming the Center for Student Engagement. But it is missing a simple solution that students have been calling for this year: a community space on campus.
There aren’t too many more ways for the Student Association, the Marvin Center Governing Board and The Hatchet’s editorial board to say this: Students need a place for students where they can forge what will be the memories that make their college experience.
It is almost intuitive to expect that, on a college campus, students will have a university-oriented space to call their own. This space should include club meeting rooms and a lounge, a coffee shop or a relaxing area where students can hang out.
In the latest effort to develop a plan for community space, Marvin Center Governing Board chair Dylan Pyne is seeking to add new furniture to Columbian Square to attract more students and turn the area into a student hub.
Pyne has previously asked for space on the fifth floor and the fourth floor, and now, because he is uncertain that any of those requests will be heard, he has been reduced to asking for couches.
Students deserve more than couches in a food court.
Pyne’s efforts have come on the heels of persistent loss of student space on campus. First the University abruptly closed The Fishbowl in September, which was lamely counter-balanced by a few small meeting rooms in the basement of the Marvin Center.
Then the Hippodrome, billiards area and WOW Café and Wingery were closed on the Marvin Center fifth floor. And student advocacy for a community space was clearly disregarded, as the entire floor will be replaced by administrative offices that students orgs might be able to use after 7 p.m. Even if that option works, that’s a only meeting place for orgs to do work. What about a place for all students to relax and bond?
With a setup like that, how can we call the Marvin Center our student union?
When students today look back on their college experiences, they likely won’t remember the Marvin Center as a place other than where they spent their freshman year’s dining dollars. The University has had repeated chances to make it more than that, but it has instead failed to sufficiently take into account the student leaders’ advocacy on this issue.
Now, campus space is almost gobbled up. Administration, please don’t ignore these last-ditch efforts to salvage any area for student space.
Whether the University addresses it or not, students will not stop calling for community space on campus. The only difference is, in the future, the University might not have the square-footage to do something about it.
Students are still left without that fundamental area that can serve as a hub for the entire campus. It is truly infuriating to see this eternal student complaint ignored despite persistent student advocacy. It is also insulting in light of the fact that there have been opportunities to fix this problem.
When students look back on their time at the University, they could fondly remember how all of campus gathered together to study, hang out, hear different student performances and hold events.
But right now, alums will only remember how they stood closely packed together at the Gelman Starbucks.
Sure, the University attempted to revamp J Street by putting in Metro Diner and installing couches and chairs. But this effort did not go far enough, as it is hard to relax in between students eating their greasy burgers and fries. And the same is true for the basement of Ivory Tower.
Students aren’t asking for much in seeking a place to get together. All we really want is to be like many other colleges.
As the possibility for student space diminishes, it has become increasingly clear how out of touch the University is on this issue.
And all it has to do to fix that is tune into what students are saying.

Last fall, the Residence Hall Association carefully considered whether or not to support the then-proposed housing cancellation fee, which has attracted much attention since its announcement in The Hatchet (“Housing to levy $350 fee for cancelled housing,” Jan. 23, p. 4). The policy, aimed at reducing a growing housing waitlist, underwent multiple levels of review before our organization ultimately decided to support the change.
The RHA recognizes that some may oppose this change. But members of the community should take the time to understand how this change is actually a benefit to students living on campus before simply writing it off as “a hard-line tactic,” as Hatchet columnist Trent Hagan did (“Give students five days before charging for housing,” Feb. 2, p. 4).
From historical data, it is clear that a significant number of students apply for on-campus housing with no intention of living on campus, and this creates challenges for the hundreds of students who either know they want to live on campus – or need to because of financial or other circumstances – by placing them on the waitlist. The waitlist leads to student ire and confusion, as many are often left without housing for weeks. By establishing this new policy, the University took a measured approach to prioritize students who want or need to live on campus, and the RHA supports that effort.
There are several ways to avoid the fee. If you apply for housing and cancel before assignments are announced, you do not incur a fee. If you wish to cancel after assignments are announced, you can avoid the fee by giving your assignment to a student on the waitlist. If you apply for housing and are placed on the waitlist, you may cancel without incurring a fee.
The goal is to prevent some students’ choices from having negative consequences on the choices of others. For this reason, I predict that this policy will give more students their preferred housing assignments and minimize the size of the waitlist. Nevertheless, the RHA will closely monitor the effects of this policy and provide the University with feedback to ensure that the policy’s goal of making the housing selection process fairer is fulfilled.
Matthew Galewski is the president of the Residence Hall Association.

The city’s planned streetcar system may cut residents’ transportation costs and draw in thousands of new jobs over the next decade, a study released Jan. 26 by the D.C. Office of Planning found.
The review sought to “ensure that the city and its residents gain the greatest possible benefits from the new system, and that the overarching vision and goals for the District are furthered by the new system,” according to the study.
The $1.5 billion network that will span the city’s eight wards could funnel in up to 7,700 jobs, add up to $8 billion in real estate development and improve public health.
Early planning efforts for the streetcar project – designed to give residents more transportation options – began in 1997 with a District Department of Transportation public transit strategy study.
The 37-mile system’s first stretch, down H Street and Benning Road in Northeast D.C., is slated to open in the summer of 2013 – after originally being projected for this spring.
“In fact, the scale of the District’s proposed system and the history of many of the city’s main commercial corridors and neighborhoods, which grew up around an earlier streetcar network, may actually help the District realize greater benefits from a streetcar system than some of these counterpart cities,” the study reads.
D.C. was home to a 200-mile streetcar network until 1962, when the city ended the service in favor of buses.
Along with alleviating congestion in current public transportation options, the cars would improve access for more than 100,000 city residents who do not own vehicles.
“The streetcar will link certain segments of neighborhoods that don’t have access to the Metro,” DDOT spokeswoman Monica Hernandez said.
Rides will cost $1 – a cheaper trip compared to Metro fare, which begins at $1.95, or $1.60 with a SmarTrip. The closest streetcar stops to campus would be on K Street and in Georgetown.
While buses are cheaper to implement, the study notes, streetcars could generate less noise with “superior ride quality” than rail lines that accelerate and decelerate quickly.

It’s hard to avoid the chatter about student fees these days.
Between daily complaints from students about paying out-of-pocket costs, to the Student Association’s effort to bring the issue to the Board of Trustees, the issue is gaining prominence on campus.
Some, like SA Executive Vice President Ted Costigan, believe that certain fees amount to a higher cost than the cost of the service it covers, such as the former 9 cent printing fee or the still-in-place $550 to $6,150 study abroad fee.
Making the community pay so many of these extra charges reduces student satisfaction for the University and damages its image. And while there is no easy solution to the fee issue, the University should make the distribution of fees more transparent, and begin to find a long-term solution for covering the cost of these charges.
Extra fees cause anger and frustration for many, as students and families often complain of being nickel-and-dimed throughout their time at GW. It can be exasperating that these fees come in addition to one of the most expensive tuition costs in the country.
But what is the University to do? Clearly administrators are in a bind. It is impossible to simply eliminate all fees, given that they are often necessary to cover certain services. It would be difficult for the University to hold science laboratories and provide students with sufficient learning tools if we didn’t pay a $60 fee covering that equipment.
On the other hand, lumping fees into tuition will raise the sticker price of the University, something that makes administrators justifiably wary. And it would be difficult to fairly calculate fees into students’ tuition, as some students end up needing more services than others.
But the presence of fees for services such as $50 for technology use or $160 for University Police Department presence at student organization events seems shocking.
Calling for a review of how to provide fee-requiring services in a more efficient manner is a good place to start. All across higher education, universities are attempting to operate with more efficiency to drive down soaring costs and expenses, an idea most recently championed by United States President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address. By operating more efficiently, universities can trim down budget fat and re-allocate resources.
When the University embarks on a large capital fundraising campaign this June, why not recruit donations to cover the costs of some fees? Yes, donating for fees is certainly not as appealing as funding a building or a scholarship, but a small amount of money will go a long way in covering some of these burdensome costs.
But for the short term, the University should take the Student Association’s push for fee transparency seriously. Students should be provided with as comprehensive a list as possible of fees students might incur during college. Allowing students and their families to understand where fees originate and why they are necessary will go a long way in establishing a bond of trust between the University and its students on this issue.
The University needs to be transparent and engage the community regarding fees. Otherwise it will be in danger of being seen as uncaring about a principal student concern. And that’s a much tougher image issue to address.

The University is trying to make J Street a destination dining option for all students – not just those with Dining Dollars. The student dining venue improved on the variety, healthiness, and most importantly, quality of the food offered there. But how does the University begin to change the reputation that J Street has among students?
If the University wants to truly improve J Street’s appeal, it has to begin by convincing students, especially upperclassmen, to eat there – even though they don’t have to. To do so, the University should start having more events at J Street, such as all-you-can-eat buffets each week.
Establishing some J Street traditions will help make it a destination for students and perhaps reverse its negative reputation.
Freshmen like myself never experienced the storied horror of what J Street used to be. Today it’s something of a hangout spot: I sometimes meet friends there for dinner; I get a salad and do homework; I grab a coffee and run to my 9:35 am class. I like J Street. Sometimes I even love it.
A lot of upperclassmen, on the other hand, don’t. They remember the J Street that was more like a mall food court. And I’m not sure my freshman peers love it enough to return when they aren’t required to go there anymore.
A recent University-wide survey indicated that satisfaction with the revamped J Street is up by 11 percent (however, they only provided the increase and declined to release overall satisfaction so this survey means little). But there’s more to be done if the newly overhauled J Street wants to endure as a go-to campus spot.
Part of the issue lies in the fact that upperclassmen have other options. With kitchens and Colonial Cash, why bother eating at J Street when you can get cheaper food of similar or better quality?
The Mount Vernon Campus provides students with an option that might just bring the upperclassmen back. Every Sunday, the dining hall in West Hall holds a buffet, offering all-you-can-eat brunch options, such as eggs, waffles and salads. While it obviously caters more to students who live on the Vern, students on Foggy Bottom are sometimes enticed to jump on the Vern Express to join them.
After all, it takes Dining Dollars, it’s all-you-can-eat and it’s brunch. What more could you ask for?
J Street could use really use something like this.
And by keeping it consistent, perhaps having it on a weekly basis like they do over at West Hall, J Street can have staying power in students’ minds. “J-Brunch” could become something of a tradition – wake up Sunday morning, head over to J Street, recap the weekend, eat pancakes. Or waffles. Whatever you prefer.
Last semester, the J Street restaurant Thyme offered a Thanksgiving dinner and a crab night—attracting students who wouldn’t usually set foot into J Street. But events like these didn’t happen often enough. These sorts of events – nights when J Street offers special menu items or themed dinners – grab people’s attention and draw them to J Street.
Getting students, especially upperclassmen, to try J Street and start thinking about it differently, means J Street will become a competitive dining option and not just one that’s required. GW just has to work on getting upperclassmen with bad memories of the former J Street to try it, realize much has improved, and maybe even start coming back.
But even more important is convincing current freshmen that the dining hall they enjoy today will still be worth their money when it’s no longer required.

The Student Association’s finance committee is tackling concerns from graduate student groups who claim they were shortchanged by a new policy implemented this fall.
Student Association Finance Committee chair John Bennett, U-At Large, is working to mitigate a rule change that combined funding pools for graduate and undergraduate activities, forcing graduate students to compete more broadly for funding and to pay for programming they say doesn’t benefit them.
In past years, the University’s largest graduate organizations were automatically given 100 percent of their student fee contributions – which charges students of all levels $1.50 per credit hour with a 50-cent match from the University – and the fund was split among several hundred groups with limited oversight from the Student Association.
This year, their funding was left entirely to the discretion of the finance committee.
The policy dividing money raised by graduates and undergraduates was scrapped this year, Bennett explained, because it had “allowed graduate students to benefit disproportionately from the pool of funding that the SA gets every year” by letting them keep money without competing for it like the 500-plus undergraduate organizations do.
But graduate students are concerned that their student fees now “end up subsidizing campus-wide programming that their constituents rarely attend anyway,” like Fall Fest or Fountain Fling, Bennett said.
The junior is collaborating with leaders from graduate groups and staff in the Center for Student Engagement to forge a compromise that will make the process more favorable for graduate groups.
With the baseline, Bennett said “graduate umbrella groups who interact minimally with the SA could be assured some sort of financial certainty.”
Bennett, who declared a bid for Student Association president last week, said he hopes to implement a new policy that would guarantee a base level of funding for the many graduate student umbrella groups on campus, which are responsible for the budgets of dozens of branch organizations. The move is likely to bring Bennett graduate support – which has proved to be a key voting bloc in past SA elections.
This year was the first in which organizations received their funding up-front rather than applying for co-sponsorships throughout the year, putting the onus on organizations to carefully allot money for events and operational costs.
Most graduate organizations were unaware of the changes to their funding pools or the allocation process in general, Bennett said, blaming last year’s senate for not preparing student organizations for tighter budgets.
“None of the people who sponsored or signed the bill last year bothered to tell [graduate groups] what had taken place,” Bennett said. “So they were essentially left unaware of the changes, which prompted totally justifiable concern.”
The “underlying culture” of graduate groups has historically kept them separate from the Student Association, Bennett said, though the body includes representation from graduate students.
Last year’s finance committee included only three graduate students. Out of the 11 members on this year’s finance committee, graduate students hold seven spots – a figure that had some worried about the group’s ability to fairly allocate the SA’s $950,000 budget to student organizations.
Their heightened presence also means that graduate students could have a greater impact on changing finance policies.
The GW Student Bar Association, an umbrella group that oversees 60 law school organizations, received about $20,000 less in allocations this year compared to last year.
“The biggest problem for us is that we are now forced to be stingier at the outset with regard to student group budget requests. We’ve had to make tough decisions as a result,” Nicholas Nikic, the organization’s president, said.

This story was updated on Feb. 7, 2012 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Student Association senators James Bonneau and Jake Chervinsky served as senators last year. The students were members of the Joint Elections Committee, not the senate. The Hatchet regrets this error.

Unionized University Police officers will finish voting Monday evening to determine if members approve of a proposed contract with GW or if the roughly 85-member force will picket for the first time in its history.
The University’s contract with the International Union, Security, Police, Fire Professionals of America expired Dec. 31, and renewal negotiations over the past month have been tense, leading to a “bad deal,” Darrin Carter, president of the Local 294 branch of the union that the officers fall under, said.
The agreement hammered out in talks Thursday and Friday settled on a 3-percent wage increase for the first year of a three-year contract, but it opens up pay negotiations for later years – according to a proposal obtained by The Hatchet – likely bringing union representatives and the University back to the bargaining table in a year.
Voting on the contract began Saturday, Carter said, and will conclude Monday evening. Of the officers he has spoken with, Carter said 80 percent dislike the deal, though he does not yet know which votes they placed in the ballot box.
The plan to picket if the deal does not receive a majority vote is not a bluff, Carter said, adding that the officers do not wish to strike and would hold the protests to share their message with the community and University leadership.
In the event that more than half of the officers in the union reject the proposal, officers would continue working their scheduled shifts but still participate in the informational picketing while off duty, passing out literature and forming a line outside UPD’s headquarters at the Woodhull House.
Guy Thomas, one of the union’s national directors, said officers have been given copies of the agreement and debriefed on its terms, and the next step is to wait for the voting period to close.
“We’re letting each individual officer make their own individual decision,” Thomas said. “You can never predict these.”
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to speculate on whether officers will accept the agreement or the potential for picketing.
“Both sides reached agreement Friday evening after an extended period of good-faith negotiations,” a University statement provided by the Office of Media Relations read.
Wages are not locked down for second and third years of the proposed contract, and if the agreement passed, the union would reopen talks after the first year’s fixed 3-percent pay increase to “try to get the best wage increase we could for the officers.”
On average, police patrol officers at colleges and universities across the country earn $46,560 annually, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics published in May 2010. Security patrol officers at GW make about $42,000 annually, Carter said – about $21.41 an hour.
A 3-percent wage hike would raise the hourly rate to $22.05 – still 34 cents lower than the national hourly mean wage.
The proposed contract does not include the union’s demand for a 5-cent raise for night differentials, or payment for work between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. That wage had stood at 75 cents an hour for more than 15 years, Carter and Thomas said.
The contract also includes provisions that would allow the University to cancel an officer’s leave in major emergencies and require him or her to show up to shifts they previously had approval to miss, unless the officer could show receipts or other proof that they spent at least $100 on a vacation.
One officer whose leave was canceled during the holiday season, despite approval by supervisors, said he will vote against the proposed agreement because of the leave cancellation clause. He asked to remain anonymous because UPD officers are not authorized to speak to the media.
“You should not have to worry and say, ‘Maybe I’ll be called in, maybe I won’t,’ if you have approved leave,” he said.
Another officer, who has heard that many of his colleagues are voting against the agreement, said he voted in favor of the proposal because it is reasonable. He added that the leave condition for receipts serves as a protection for officers who have spent a large sum on plane tickets.
“You have to give something to get some stuff,” he said. “Sometimes you’ve got to understand where the people you work for are coming from. It’s not all about you.”
