Everyone should study peace.
Now, this isn’t some sissy, hippie plea for world peace. It’s a call for American students to develop a better understanding of how peace can improve the world.
And if GW is the nation’s most politically active campus, then it’s time for this next generation of American leaders to carry the world toward a more peaceful future.
The University can start this process by requiring students to take a course in peace studies.
I became interested in peace and nonviolence studies during high school when I attended a summer camp in Maine called Seeds of Peace. This was not an ordinary camp experience, though, as between swimming and soccer, campers broke into small groups for 90-minute conflict resolution sessions.
Israelis, Palestinians, Egyptians, Jordanians, Pakistanis, Indians, Afghanis – plus a handful of American teenagers like me – discussed how to improve our world through peace, not violence.
Most of the campers had never interacted with peers from the other side of their conflict. Palestinians knew Israelis only as soldiers at border crossings, but at Seeds of Peace, they had come willingly to meet their enemies.
These types of discussions allow students to alter the way they think about foreign relations. Courses in peace studies help students do this by introducing them to alternatives to violence and preparing them to foster such a culture in their communities after graduation.
I grew up in Baltimore when it was one of the most dangerous cities in America. “Bodymore, Murdaland” ­– the city’s nickname ­– is a gruesome homage to the city’s annual homicide rate of 300. Rather than allowing the streets of Baltimore to teach the next generation, perhaps, trite as it might sound, lessons from Gandhi could help change the city for the better.
Perhaps Colman McCarthy, an advocate for teaching peace studies in high schools, said it best: “If we don’t teach them peace, someone else is going to teach them violence.”
But that is not going to happen until there is a cultural change in the nation’s capital. And that change begins with students demanding more. As scholars in the nation’s capital, the onus is on us to choose to become students of peace.
A peace policy, some say, lets the terrorists “win.” And, further, by teaching children the value of peace, we will contribute to the “wussification” of the American youth.
But don’t Americans want to live in a society known for safety and calm rather than one filled with danger and terror? If we want to live in peace, then why not teach peace?
The University should require peace studies as it does for courses in science, math and humanities.
But while we wait for that University mandate, register for a course in peace studies – you’ve still got time to sign up.

The city may relax restrictions on food trucks, allowing the mobile eateries to stay parked for longer periods of time when they are not serving customers.
The District’s Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs set forth a handful of amendments to the decades-old law for vending vehicles Friday to lift a statute that required food trucks to move from their spots if there are no customers in line. The proposed regulations need approval from the D.C. Council after a 30-day public comment period.
Vendors can only “remain at [a] location for the duration of the time allowed by the parking meter or applicable posted parking regulations,” according to the proposed law. Trucks that sell sweets, including ice cream, confectionary treats, coffee and tea, would still move after 10 minutes with no patrons in line.
DCRA legislative affairs specialist Helder Gil said by making it easier for street vendors like food trucks to operate, he expects the revisions will produce a spike in the number of food trucks in the city.
“Our goal is to update 30-year-old regulations, eliminate confusion and ambiguities and generally make it easier for these small businesses to be able to start up and operate in the District,” Gil said. The old rules existed before the rapid growth in popularity of food trucks in the city.
The proposal also calls for “vending development zones” – or areas where communities can designate how many food trucks, sidewalk vendors and farmers markets they need. Businesses, neighborhood groups or city agencies would be permitted to submit applications to create the zones.
“Our proposed vending regulations seek to balance the interests of street vendors and bricks-and-mortar businesses while seeking to ensure District consumers have a variety of new, vibrant food options to choose from,” Gil said.
Moustafa Shokra, a chef for the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food truck Tasty Kabob, said the new laws would not necessarily affect his truck, typically parked at 22nd and H streets in an area marked by the city as a vending location.
“The new laws affect food trucks parking in downtown D.C. more, although they were really not fair,” he said.
The H Street spots, under the proposed law, would be designated to vendors based on a monthly lottery system.
FoodTruckFiesta.com, a website that tracks the city’s food trucks, reported Jan. 12 that Metropolitan Police officers were ticketing food trucks that did not have lines of patrons with a $50 fine. The site also said trucks with 17 or more violations risked having their licenses revoked.
Food trucks are a growing presence on campus and throughout the city, as many businesses expand or add a mobile presence.
Local entrepreneur Kris Hart, owner of campus eatery and grocery shop FoBoGro, said the existing rules offer an unfair advantage to food trucks – which pay lower taxes than restaurants, delis and sandwich shops – and the amendments would not foster much change.
“I don’t mind them. I support them 100 percent, but they have it easier than us,” he said.
There are about 94 registered food trucks in the District, according to FoodTruckFiesta.com.

When the University began considering renovating the fifth floor of the Marvin Center, some student leaders hoped that part of the redesign would include a collaborative space for student organizations.
Yet the University has decided that the fifth floor will be occupied by Career Services and other administrative offices.
Now, Marvin Center Governing Board Chair Dylan Pyne, student leader Aria Varasteh and Student Association Executive President John Richardson are lobbying to move the Center for Student Engagement office to the fifth floor, as well to open its current fourth floor office area into a collaborative student organization space.
The University must adopt this proposed plan, as it is crucial that additional student space is made available in the Marvin Center.
While The Hatchet’s editorial board previously called for the fifth floor’s renovation to include a student lounge, this option is clearly no longer a possibility.
But as the Marvin Center is the University’s student union, students still deserve to benefit from renovations made to the building. Student organization space is essential for fostering dialogue among groups of students and allowing for smaller student organizations to have access to meeting space and club resources.
Currently, the vast majority of GW’s more than 400 clubs do not have access to permanent office space. And while there will be additional meeting rooms installed on the fifth floor, they will not be exclusively for student groups.
But it is even more essential that a community-oriented student organization space is created, because once the Marvin Center redesign is completed, remaining campus options for student meeting spaces are sparse.
The University must make a good-faith effort to listen to the concerns that student leaders are voicing, and must continually work with them to find a way to include collaborative space on the fourth floor.

As students start a new semester and finalize their schedules, they are faced with the pricey task of purchasing textbooks.
Oftentimes, students and families find themselves paying hundreds of dollars each semester for books as a single textbook  can approach $200 in the maths and sciences.
Clearly, textbook costs pose too high a financial burden for students.
While there is now a textbook rental option at the bookstore and the list of required texts are posted online even before registration, more can still be done to lower the costs of textbooks.
The best way to help drive down the price of textbooks is for the University to actively work with professors, as they are often unaware of how expensive textbooks can be for students.
One great way to do this is to encourage professors to use cheaper online resources to replace traditional textbooks. There are new online open-source websites that allow students to mix and match different chapters from different texts. Students can highlight online, or even print out pages and chapters for a fee much smaller than the normal cost of a textbook.
Professors can also edit the material and add in important information when they deem it necessary.
Besides online solutions, instructors should also be encouraged to avoid bundled textbook packages, and to consider using old versions of textbooks if the newer editions do not have significant updates.
While the University and many professors are certainly aware of the high cost of textbooks, working together to find cheaper textbooks solutions will serve to relieve the financial burden on students and families.

A deal between student leaders and The New York Times will temporarily restore free newspapers on campus, after months of lobbying against the University’s decision to slash its daily delivery program last fall.
The month-long pilot coordinated by the Student Association will deliver between 200 and 300 newspapers to the Marvin Center each weekday starting Jan. 23, the organization’s president John Richardson said.
Until this fall, GW paid $52,000 per year for daily deliveries of the Times, USA Today and The Washington Post, through USA Today’s collegiate readership program.
Richardson felt USA Today’s package was too costly, so instead of rejoining the readership program, he decided to seek out subscriptions from news outlets individually. The leader said he lobbied the Times for months to reach a deal on the complimentary trial run. In the future, Richardson said the Times delivery program could be expanded to include The Post and USA Today, but he does not yet know if this partnership would cost less than the previous newspaper deal.
The Times will supply its newspapers for free to help gauge initial interest in the program, he said.
He is still working with the Times to negotiate a price for continuing daily delivery after the test run.
Newspapers will be delivered to the Student Association office in the Marvin Center and placed in a distribution box near J Street by members of the SA. They will also tally the number of leftover newspapers each day – figures Richardson said he would use to campaign for continuing the program at GW.
“If all the papers get picked up at the end of the day, it’s indicative of demand,” Rohan Batra, SA vice president of academic affairs, said. Last year, about 1,000 papers were delivered to the Marvin Center and residence halls across campus.
Batra told The Hatchet in October that the program’s data showed students picked up about 75 percent of the 140,000 papers delivered to campus last year. But with a much smaller number of papers distributed during the pilot, he expects every copy to leave the stand.
Even if the Student Association is able to demonstrate a high student demand, Richardson said he does not expect the University to foot the bill because of budgetary pressures throughout Student and Academic Support Services, the department that had paid for the program in past years. Instead, the junior will look to the Student Association’s funding pool – which was about $970,000 this year – to support the program.
Dean of Students Peter Konwerski told The Hatchet in October that the decision to cut the program was based on decreased interest in the program, as well as increased online activity among readers.

Student leaders are stepping up their commitment to pedestrian safety, working with the University to assess the daily dangers of crisscrossing campus.
Student Association Sen. Danica Brown, U-At Large, spent the fall campaigning for an official campus safety review with the D.C. Department of Transportation, which she hopes to see by the end of the semester.
“I think [pedestrian safety] is a concern many parents have, especially parents of students from rural areas. The University is large, and if you’re not used to being in a city, you need to be more alert,” she said.
Pedestrian safety raised concern last March, when vehicles on campus struck two students. After these incidents, the Student Association felt that H Street should be a priority for their efforts.
The District sees about 650 cases yearly where a pedestrian is struck by a vehicle, resulting in an average of 15 pedestrian deaths, according to DDOT’s website. Pedestrian crashes increased by about 23 percent from 2009 to 2010 – the last year for which data is available.
In mid-December, Brown conducted a campus walk-through with University safety officials, including University Police Department Assistant Chief Frank Demes and Director of the Office of Emergency Management George Nuñez, to observe the movement of pedestrians and vehicles on H Street. Based on their input, Brown is now in the process of applying for a DDOT assessment of the high-traffic intersection near Gelman Library.
“There’s a lot of movement of cars and movement of humans,” Brown said of the area, adding that she hopes to expand the review to other areas in the future.
As part of the proposed pedestrian traffic audit, a trained DDOT team would observe busy campus sites to determine potential safety improvements. Possibilities include re-zoning an area by changing speed limits or placing traffic-calming devices, such as speed bumps or grids on the road to slow tires, DDOT spokesperson Michaud Gray said.
A speed bump could only be installed if 70 percent of the block’s residents support the measure.
While the DDOT assessment does not cost money, any physical changes that result from the review would require financial support from GW.
Brown and Student Association Executive Vice President Ted Costigan met last fall with several GW officials, including administrators who handle city relations, to vet campus safety plans. Brown also met with the Ward 2 liaison for the mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Engagement, James Bulger, who likewise recommended the University seeks a DDOT review.
Brown is also coordinating a street smart awareness week for this spring. She hopes to use a social media campaign to discuss the risks of using electronic devices while walking in a city, giving students “a wake up call to pay attention.”
At the national level, a study published last week by the University of Maryland found the number of headphone-wearing pedestrians seriously injured or killed near streets and railways has tripled over six years. Of the 116 cases studied, two-thirds of the people involved were younger than 30.

Clinical psychologist Richard Cooter wants his students to think like criminals.
The newly hired associate professor – who graduated from GW in 2004 and practiced law for 25 years before that – will spend the next several months outlining a curriculum that combines the science and the mindset behind breaking the law for a new master’s degree program in forensic psychology that will launch this fall.
“People are interested in why anyone would be that way – be that vicious, be that uncaring – and what sorts of psychological needs that behavior satisfies,” Cooter, the lead faculty member for the program, said. “People are interested in why.”
The forensic sciences program will be integrated with GW’s professional psychology program, which its director, Loring Ingraham said “is designed to provide doctoral-level training in clinical psychology.”
GW already has a natural science-based forensic sciences program with degree concentrations in forensic chemistry, forensic molecular biology and forensic toxicology.
Cooter and forensic psychology professor Rocio Lopez Sharifi are modeling the curriculum after existing programs at for-profit institutions like Argosy University and Capella University.
“We’re trying to incorporate the best of all of them and model it so we create real quality,” Cooter said.
The master’s program will have a two-year curriculum with 37 required credits in the fields of applied forensics and applied psychology. These courses – held in the Arlington Graduate Education Center in Arlington, Va. – will include subjects like psychopathology, victimology, psychological profiling, interrogation, interviewing and counterintelligence.
By teaching tactics for delving into the criminal mind, Cooter said the program will produce graduates who can enter fields like law enforcement and counterterrorism.
“When you’re asking me questions and you’re trying to get answers, you want to know what makes me tick. When you figure out what makes me tick, then you can figure out how to get the answers to your questions,” Cooter said, putting himself in the shoes of an interrogation subject. “If you can figure that out in law enforcement or antiterrorism, it can help you get the information you need.”
Peg Barratt, dean of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, said the proximity to national law enforcement and homeland security agencies will allow students in the program unique access and internships.
“Of course, we wouldn’t have created the program if we didn’t feel it would attract a high level of interest,” Barratt said.
Cooter said he anticipates that 20 to 25 students will initially enroll in the program.

The Hatchet incorrectly listed that the forensic psychology program would be held on the Virginia Science and Technology Campus. It will actually be held in the Arlington Graduate Education Center in Arlington, Va.
