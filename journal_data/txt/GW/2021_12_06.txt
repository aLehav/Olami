GWIT has been without a permanent head since last September, when Loretta Early stepped down amid layoffs and a restructuring of the department. 
Updated: Dec. 11, 2021 at 12:48 p.m.
After pausing the probe for a chief digital officer in May, Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz said they will resume the search “in the near future,” hoping to fill the role by the end of the fiscal year.
GW has operated without a permanent information technology leader since former Chief Information Officer Loretta Early stepped down last September as officials laid off several IT staff and restructured the department to a centralized shared services model. Jared Johnson, the interim chief technology officer who took over last fall after Jonathan Fozard’s two month stint, has led a department that faculty said has been understaffed and overwhelmed with IT support requests.
Officials laid off dozens of technology staff last year to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic and asked them to reapply for a smaller number of positions under the new structure.
Diaz, who is overseeing the search, said officials hope to fill the position before the end of the fiscal year – which concludes June 30.
“The market for technology and digital talent is not immune to the same forces that are impacting several other areas of the labor market,” he said in an email. “While the evolving market presents challenges, it simply requires GW to heighten our efforts to find the best qualified candidate.”
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said officials are committed to finding the best chief digital officer for GW.
“As we have shared previously, GW created a new position of Chief Digital Officer (CDO) which will take the place of the traditional Chief Information Officer role,” she said in an email. “The CDO will lead the University’s digital transformation, leveraging technology as a strategic driver in support of our academic mission.”
Nosal said last August that officials were reassessing their objectives in the “technology space” when Early stepped down last September, adding that they planned to conduct a search “in the future.”
“The move to a strategically focused CDO position will replace the need for the CIO position,” she said in an email late last August.
Johnson, the interim chief technology officer, has worked at GW for 17 years and said he plans to stay in his role in the near future.
“I have many deep relationships here, many relationships that are family,” he said. “So I enjoy coming to work each day.”
But Johnson’s tenure has coincided with an understaffed department and a surge in IT support requests this semester, and faculty say a shortage of employees left without a permanent leader could negatively impact the support that IT is able to offer to the GW community.
Nosal said last November that officials still planned to create the chief digital officer position when Fozard departed the University.
“The CDO will lead the University’s digital transformation, leveraging technology as a strategic driver in support of our academic mission,” she said in an email.
Eric Grynaviski, the chair of the technology subcommittee of the Faculty Senate’s educational policy and technology committee, delivered a report at last month’s senate meeting stating that the reduction in IT staff and shift to a centralized shared services model for IT have has led to more time being needed to resolve IT issues.
“The subcommittee believes that no organizational model would be sufficient with current staffing levels,” he said. “We simply don’t have enough people answering the phone, and it doesn’t quite matter how you organize them.”
Grynaviski said under the shared services model, all IT staff report to the chief financial officer, compared to the previous model in which some staff reported to the Office of the President and others reported to the Office of the Provost.
He said though the committee has not taken a stance on which model is more effective, faculty have “strong opinions” about the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
Grynaviski said certain aspects of IT services under the chief financial officer’s supervision would better succeed if handled by the provost’s office, including the management of the Banner system that faculty often use.
IT staff received more than double the amount of support requests in the first week of the semester compared to previous in-person fall semesters. Grynaviski’s presentation states that 73 percent of IT support requests were answered in September and almost 75 percent were answered in October.
Harald Griesshammer, an associate professor of physics and a member of the senate’s education policy and technology committee, said at last month’s senate meeting that the previous model was more efficient because academic technologies reported to the provost, who was more aware of faculty issues than Diaz, the chief financial officer.
“For me, it doesn’t make sense that the academic side of IT is reporting to this chief financial officer who frankly has no idea about academic needs and is most likely to prioritize budgetary issues over educational or research issues,” he said.
Griesshammer said he’s concerned about GW’s ability to retain IT staff like Johnson given that other organizations in the D.C. area may have jobs with better salaries and fewer hours.
“We can only hang in, and we can just hope that Jared is not going to call it quits,” he said.
Joe Cordes, a professor of economics and public policy and public administration and faculty senator, said at institutions of higher education, searches for positions like a chief digital officer are sometimes unsuccessful on their first attempt to fill the role, especially since they are a “hot commodity” in the job market.
“I’m quite certain they’re going to find somebody, but sometimes it takes more than one try,” he said.
Cordes said incoming interim University President Mark Wrighton will likely decide whether filling the position will be a priority during his time in the position.
“He might say that, ‘Absolutely this is a top priority, and we’ve got to move it along yesterday,’ in which case it will happen very quickly,” Cordes said. “I just don’t know.”

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
I’ve never been much of a talker. That might sound paradoxical coming from someone who’s hosted a podcast for the better part of the last two years, but I think it helps explain why I was drawn to journalism in the first place. Reporting gives people like me the chance to listen, really listen, as others share their stories, perspectives and insights.
Since I first joined The Hatchet in the fall of my freshman year, this paper has given me the opportunity to listen to hundreds of voices in and around the GW community, all of whom have fed my curiosity and hopefully helped others better understand this (oftentimes wild) University.
But the funny thing is, I was petrified of interviewing when I first signed up to write for The Hatchet. I knew I wanted to push myself, and thought reporting for the school paper would be as good a chance as any to see if I even liked journalism.
And so soon enough, there I was, scribbling down quotes from professors, students, coaches and administrators, desperately trying to keep my hands steady from the nerves as I prepared my next question.
But it was also in those moments when I first realized I needed to lean on something I knew I could do, which of course was to listen. And not just listening to what I was being told, but also listening for what wasn’t being said, which was oftentimes just as revealing.
After making plenty of mistakes and becoming more comfortable with reporting, as one often does with more experience, I helped report on important stories from the underrepresentation of female coaches in the A-10 to pushback on the 20/30 Plan. Before long, I’d already been on The Hatchet for well over a year and a half when the opportunity came along to host the news podcast, a medium I knew little about.

But I knew I wanted to push the envelope in helping to tell stories for The Hatchet, and podcasting seemed a good way to do that. It’s also a personal medium, where you’re literally hearing someone speak right up in your ears (assuming you’re wearing headphones). And so that also appealed to me, by bringing the experience of listening directly to the GW community as interviewees explained stories in their own words.
I’m immensely grateful to all of the students, professors, administrators and experts who have lent their voices to the podcast over the last year-plus, helping listeners (including myself) make sense of countless topics. Of course, the impact of the pandemic on college life consumed many episodes, but your voices also helped amplify stories including the negative impact of GW’s real expansion in Foggy Bottom, the necessity of mental health resources on campus, student voter participation and so many more.
I’m forever grateful to have been just a small contributor to The Hatchet’s coverage over the last few years, and I’m also indebted to the many people who have inspired and mentored me along the way. Here’s just a few:
Zach: We’ve come a long way, my friend. From the second floor of Madison Hall freshman year to roommates now, it’s been a crazy ride these last few years. But I’m thankful for your support through it all, and also grateful that the Hatchet has served as a common denominator for us. As I’ve also observed countless times over, you’re a tremendous journalist and leader, and I’m constantly inspired by the effort you pour into everything you take on. I can’t wait to see where your skills lead you, since I know you’ll be amazing at anything you do moving forward!
Lia: When I heard you were interested in running for EIC, I was really excited, because I knew you’d have the skills to lead the Hatchet with responsibility and grace. You’ve done that and more since you were elected, including by pushing me each week to help the podcast section produce great content. I’m very excited to see where you take the paper next semester! I’ve also seen you do great reporting over the years, including in our capstone class this semester, which warrants a nod here.
Jared: Ah, the Philly sports fan (had to). You were one of my first Hatchet friends from our time on the academics team way back in the day, and I still look back fondly on all the co-bylines we had (which feels like decades ago now). It’s also been awesome to watch you rise through the ranks over the last few years, as you’ve led with care and consistently done great work at every stop along the way. Shoutout for your work in the capstone class too, excited to see your last video!
Sarah S.: I couldn’t have asked for a better partner to lead the podcast section with over the last year-plus. You had a tough assignment in trying to build up an entirely new culture podcast amidst a pandemic, but I was constantly awed by your ability to come up with great pitches each week and produce amazing content. Not only that, but you did an incredible job editing the news podcast too, which would not have been as strong each week without your work on it. Enjoy your semester abroad, and I know this won’t be the last time I see your byline in the Hatchet!
Sarah R.: There was no reason you had to trust a young research assistant with zero podcasting experience to take over the news podcast. But, you did, and looking back, I’m incredibly grateful that you took a chance on me. You helped guide me along the way to meet the goals we’d initially laid out for the section, and I was constantly willing to push myself because I knew you had confidence in me. You also did an incredible job leading the Hatchet for two years, which is a remarkable feat in itself and speaks volumes about your character.
Meredith: When I first said I was interested in taking over the news podcast, you sprang right into action and helped me get ready for the job, something for which I’m very grateful. And that was also despite a difficult transition period that took place at the same time everyone was sent home due to the pandemic. You set a high bar for what a college news podcast should look like (which is especially impressive given how few college papers actually have a podcast section), so that is definitely something I’ve tried to live up to over the last year-plus.
The Facts Squad (Ed, Amy and Ciara): We had some good times, didn’t we? I know it wasn’t always easy, especially with the many stories to check through and late nights, but you all worked incredibly hard to ensure the paper was as accurate as it could be for the year we held those research assistant roles. We all moved up on the Hatchet after that year, to positions everyone was more than well-deserving of, and I can’t wait to see what you all do in the future. Ed’s exploits at Hatchet Prom will also forever be legendary.

Lizzie: You exemplified what it meant to not only be a great student journalist, but a great journalist, period. I was constantly in awe of the lengths you went to in order to shed light on necessary topics, which I know was far from easy. You were also an all-around terrific mentor from the moment I became a research assistant, and I know you were a great mentor to many others on the Hatchet as well.
Emily: I was consistently impressed with how you led the sports section for two years, a job that wasn’t always easy given our small but mighty group of reporters (our weekly Kahoot games certainly boosted section camaraderie). I also saw week in and week out the passion you had for sports reporting, which inspired everyone on the section to do what they could in the service of writing great pieces.
My first editors (Barbara and Lauren): Even though I split my time between news and sports as a reporter, which wasn’t always easy, you were both great mentors and showed me the ropes as I made the jump to student journalism at GW. Whether it involved traveling out to Virginia to cover a baseball game or doing some last-minute door-knocking for an academics story, you both helped me become a better reporter and gave me an early idea of what leadership on a student newspaper should look like.
Ilena: The original academics team was truly stacked. I feel like we practically grew up on The Hatchet together, and both on the paper and in SMPA classes, I saw how hard you worked to tell great stories. I was also really impressed with your ability to tackle different mediums, including when you helped out the podcast by making that incredible web map of GW’s expansion into Foggy Bottom through the years.
The new podcast team (Sejal and Ethan): I’m very proud of the work you’ve both put in over the last number of weeks as you get ready to take over the news and culture podcasts full-time. Taking on new roles halfway through the year is never easy, you’ve got a great network of student journalists to lean on. In just a few episodes, I’ve already heard both of your interviewing skills improve, and I’m really excited to see the work you both produce moving forward!
My family and friends: Thank you for your endless support, even when life gets stressful. I wouldn’t be who I am today without your influence and love.

GW markets itself as being committed to providing a safe space for all students. But a complaint filed in D.C.’s Office of Human Rights last month alleging that officials took down information about a “virtual processing space” for Palestinian students suggests that GW does not believe that Palestinians students deserve these same spaces. The space for was students experiencing distress due to the outbreaks of violence in Gaza last summer.
During the spring semester of 2021, amid the unrest in Israel and Palestine that started with the eviction of Palestinians from an East Jerusalem neighborhood, GW’s Office of Advocacy and Support advertised a “virtual processing space” for Palestinian students who were experiencing distress due to the violence. OAS has held these types of mental health events in the past for other marginalized groups when traumatizing violent and widely publicized events involving that group occur.
But several weeks ago, the complaint released by Palestine Legal revealed that within 24 hours of the Instagram post going up, administrators instructed OAS to remove it claiming that offering these services to Palestinian students harmed Jewish students. Further, the complaint states OAS was made to release an apology written by Assistant Vice President of Health and Safety Kathleen Fox and Assistant Director of Media Relations Crystal Nosal, saying that by acknowledging the trauma Palestinian students were experiencing, they “did not create a safe space” for all members of the community. As it currently stands, OAS cannot post on Instagram or hold events without administrators’ approval. This behavior by the administration illustrates a troubling belief that to advocate for Palestinians implies underlying antisemitism – it pushes the damaging belief that it’s impossible to advocate for one group without harming another.
While many have rightfully pointed out that there are criticisms of Israel that are solely based on antisemitic beliefs, many politicians and some activists will often imply that all criticism or protestation of Israel’s policies regarding Palestinians are antisemitic by nature. This issue with GW is mirrored by the way it presents nationally, as seen with the outcry over Ben & Jerry’s – themselves Jewish Americans from Long Island – withholding sales of ice cream in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and arguments that Human Rights Watch’s findings that Israel practices apartheid is antisemitic.
The fact of the matter is that Palestinians are being oppressed by the Israeli government. They lack freedom of movement, can be subject to forced evictions, face crackdowns on freedom of speech and have very little power in the Israeli government despite it having authority over Palestinians in the West Bank through military occupation. Further, Jewish people are not responsible for the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israeli government and the Israeli government does not speak for all Jewish people. This assumption plays into dual loyalty tropes. In fact, many Jewish students at GW are very vocal in their support of Palestinian rights and criticism of the Israeli government.
It is not acceptable for administrators to prevent OAS from giving Palestinian students mental health services on the basis of it being harmful to Jewish students when doing so insinuates that Israel is representative of all Jewish students. This claim makes even less sense considering that OAS never condemned the Israeli government in acknowledging that Palestinian students were experiencing distress.
GW’s behavior promotes the idea that to support the dignity and freedom of one group has to mean denying that humanity to another group. Even the way the Israel/Palestine situation is framed nationally promotes this idea. People are either referred to as pro-Palestine or pro-Israel in their opinions on the region by the media implying that they are against the other group. I believe Palestinians deserve justice and freedom and that this justice does not and should not result in Israelis losing the rights and freedoms they currently possess. And I would ask my peers who identify as pro-Israel to ask themselves if they believe Israeli rights are only obtainable at the expense of Palestinian rights.
GW responded to these allegations with a mealy mouthed non-apology. This is unacceptable. GW must rectify this by supporting the demands put forth by OAS of adding an Arab or Middle East and North Africa category to the Multicultural Student Services Center webpage and holding a “#GWInSolidarity” event on anti-Palestinian biases. These demands, if met, would ensure there is support given to Palestinian students and educational resources for other students to learn about and empathize with the struggles of Palestinians.
Support for Palestine alone should not be perceived to indicate hostility toward Jewish people. In fact, it is morally inconsistent to advocate for Palestinian liberation but not combat antisemitism on this campus and in the United States and vice versa. The moral position is to advocate for an end to all forms of oppression. By irresponsibly preventing OAS from simply allowing students space to process the consequences of this oppression, officials, in their own words, did not create a safe space for all members of its community.

Catch an Amtrak out of Union Station, equpped with WiFi and a quiet car.
With loads of holiday food, festivities and travel often comes enormous waste, but don’t neglect the environment this holiday season.
Whether you’re repurposing leftovers, shopping sustainably or being mindful of your carbon footprint, there are many ways to keep the environment in mind this year. Make this your most sustainable holiday season yet with these tips.
Travel:
Before you book a flight to visit loved ones, check to see if a train or carpool could get you from point A to point B. Catch a train out of Union Station, and though it may take a little longer than a flight, sit back and enjoy the ride with your favorite book or movie.
If you and some friends are heading back to the same destination, think about carpooling together. It’s a more sustainable alternative than flying, and you can enjoy each other’s company while playing road trip games or jamming to music before saying goodbye for winter break.
Residents 21 and older can rent a car in D.C. at Reagan or Dulles Airport for as little as $25.94 per day and return it at the nearest car rental to their hometown.
Leftovers:
Holiday meals certainly are delicious, but leftovers sometimes even better. Most holiday dishes, like gravy, casseroles and cheesecake, can be stored and frozen to save for a later date, so long as they don’t sit out too long.
Store extras in a reusable container, putting some in the refrigerator to enjoy in the coming week, and some in the freezer to save for up to a month. Combine leftover desserts like pie, cookies or brownies with your choice of milk and ice cream and blending, topping with some whipped cream for a delicious milkshake.
Make soup out of leftover vegetables, turkey meat and turkey bone or opt for a classic leftover sandwich. To elevate your sandwich game, spread cranberry sauce on one slice of thick sourdough bread and dijon mustard on the other, layering turkey and stuffing between, and finish it by dipping in gravy.
Gift giving:
Find ways to show your love during the holidays without contributing to consumer culture. Shopping for items that will never be used just for the sake of giving gifts negatively impacts the environment.
Shopping second hand is always a mindful way to reduce your negative environmental impact. And while you have some free time at home, think about going through your old things and donating to your local Goodwill or thrift store.
For those participating in Secret Santa this year, instead of buying a new gift, bring something you already own that you don’t use often and you know your recipient will love. Rather than buying from Amazon, Target or Apple, look to shop from the family-owned small businesses in your area.
Gift wrapping:
Gifts wrapped in holiday wrapping paper and tied with a bow certainly look pretty, but the material will inevitably be torn up and discarded. Use low waste alternatives this season like gift bags, a more environmentally friendly alternative to gift wrap, as they have the benefit of being repurposed. Save the bags from this year’s gifts and use them again next year.
Wrap your gifts in old newspapers for a stylish option to reuse paper that was on its way to the recycling bin. In lieu of a bow or fancy wrapping paper, spice up your gift wrapping job with decorations you already have laying around like hair ribbons, or head outside and collect some pine tree sprigs to tie with twine to the top of your gift. Writing a small message to your recipient with a colorful pen is also a fun way to add a pop of color.

After a stressful semester filled with exams and papers, treat yourself to a spa day before heading home.
Before you flock to online stores to do your holiday shopping this season, consider giving your loved ones something they can experience.
Give the gift of a long-lasting memory for your friends and family, including concert tickets, subscription classes on their favorite hobby or an evening out at their favorite restaurant. We’ve rounded up 10 experiential gift ideas that will have your loved ones talking about them for years to come.
1. A spa day
A full day of pampering with relaxing treatments, including facials, massages and manicures would make anyone feel special. After a stressful week of finals, grab your friend and treat them to a spa day around the D.C. area before you head out of the city for winter break. A membership could go a long way for working friends and family who may not have the time to treat themselves often.
2. An amusement park trip
Encourage your friends and family to tune into their inner child with a ticket to an amusement park. Take your loved one to an attraction like Six Flags or Busch Gardens near the DMV and they’ll come home feeling satisfied after a day of excursions.
3. A ticket to the theater 
Spend a night out attending a live musical, play, opera or dance as a way to enjoy the holiday season with your friends and family. Must-see musicals and shows like “Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” playing at The National Theatre, and “The Washington Ballet’s Nutcracker,” being performed at Warner Theatre, are touring in D.C. this holiday.
4. A concert ticket 
A night of singing and dancing to a favorite artist or band is hands-down one of the most unforgettable presents to give. Use your loved one’s Spotify Wrapped to find an artist like Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Bruno Mars, Playboi Carti or Madonna to go see in concert at venues around the DMV area this holiday season.
5. A plane ticket 
Gifting a loved one plane tickets to an attractive destination is a classic but clever choice. You and your best friend can travel together and visit eye-catching destinations like NYC, Yosemite Park, Las Vegas, Nashville and San Francisco.
6. An evening of tastings 
Whether you enjoy wine, beer, cheese or chocolate, give your the food and drink connoisseurs the gift of a tasting of their choice. The options to indulge are endless in D.C. – head to joints like Dacha Beer Garden for beer tasting or The Chocolate House in Dupont Circle for chocolate tasting.
7. A dinner at a fancy restaurant
A dinner will bring you and your loved ones closer together by sitting around a table and enjoying a meal together. Eating at their favorite restaurant or an eatery they have always wanted to try serves for a memorable bonding experience. Choose from a multitude of options within the district, like Ristorante Bonaroti, Mazi, The Capital Grille and Quadrant.
8. A music or TV subscription 
Gift your friends a brand new subscription to streaming services they might not already have accounts for like Disney+, HBO Max or Apple TV. You could also take advantage of student discounts for services like Paramount+, YouTube Premium or Spotify Premium if you are gifting a fellow college student.
9. A surprise party
Celebrate the accomplishments of your loved one this year by organizing a get-together to honor them and their hard work. Set up party games like spin the bottle, charades and Cards Against Humanity, as well as drinks, food and cake to make their year and show them how much they mean to you.
10. A subscription to a hobby class
The gift of learning and applying something new is always a wonderful takeaway for anyone, especially if you and your loved one take part together. Opt for a subscription to a language, cooking or painting class in D.C.– anything specific that would pique the interest of your friends and family. Either way, picture the joy you will bring them when they realize you have been listening to their interests all along the way.

President Joe Biden presided over Thursday’s National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony, kicking off the public viewing period that lasts through Jan. 1.
GW’s final exam schedule stretches into late December, but don’t let being stuck in the city keep you from enjoying holiday festivities.
D.C. is packed with holiday events and activities to get you into the holiday spirit throughout the month. From taking a stroll along the National Mall to get a glimpse of the National Christmas Tree to trying out some of the best hot chocolate in the city, we’ve compiled activities around the District to keep you in the holiday spirit.
Holiday decoration displays 
Located just a few blocks from campus, the National Christmas Tree is a convenient and festive holiday attraction. Each year, an evergreen tree located in the northeast quadrant of President’s Park near the White House is lit up and decorated with ornaments symbolizing the United States’ history. Surrounding the main tree, smaller evergreen trees will be decorated with ornaments handmade by students from each state. The public can swing by to see the tree which will be lit up from sundown to 11 p.m. every night until Jan 1.
Although the indoor areas of the Botanic Garden remain closed for pandemic-related precautions, head to the garden’s outdoor holiday display running daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. until Jan 2. An elaborate holiday-themed toy train track runs through multiple outdoor gardens surrounding the conservatory and glowing lighthouses are set up to guide visitors as they walk throughout the conservatory. Replicas of D.C. landmarks like the Capitol building made out of plant material decorate the spaces along with countless Poinsettias.
Outdoor activities
For a final exam study break that will get you moving, head to one of D.C.’s many ice skating rinks this holiday season. The Sculpture Garden Ice Rink is open ​​Sunday through Thursday between 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. You can skate around the Sculpture Garden Ice Rink with string lights hung overhead during your 45-minute session ($10).

Break in your U-Pass card to travel to Ice & Lights: the Winter Village at Cameron Run in Alexandria, Va. to experience ice skating and winter wonderland light village ($20). This ice rink is open nightly from 5 to 10 p.m. until Jan. 2.
Hot chocolate tour of D.C. 
Whether hot chocolate comes from a packet of instant mix or gets made with rich cream and real cocoa, it’s the go-to drink for cold days during the holiday season. Take a worthwhile trek to Tryst at 2459 18th St. NW in Adams Morgan to snag a hot cocoa with house-made lavender syrup ($4.52). Grab a seat among the coffee shop’s extensive selection of tables and couches and grind out some studying or paper writing while enjoying your warm drink.
Journey over to the Wharf and try out Colada Shop at 10 Pearl St. SW, for Chocolate de la Abuela, its Cuban-style hot cocoa ($5.75). Dip a cinnamon sugar coated churro ($7.50) into your cocoa, or simply stroll along the water and enjoy the views.
Known for its colorful and custom latte art, Cafe Georgetown is serving a peppermint hot chocolate ($7.50 or $4.50 for regular) this winter. This sweet drink is decorated with red and white candy cane designs floating atop the frothy milk and is served alongside a gingerbread man cookie for dipping.

The Capital Area Food Bank, located in the Michigan Park neighborhood, hosts dozens of volunteer opportunities each month.
Give back to the D.C. community this holiday season by volunteering at local organizations before you head out of the city for winter break.
With the end of the semester in sight, you might find yourself with extra time on your hands to be able to give back to the community before heading home for the holidays. Consider volunteering your time and energy to some of these organizations this holiday season.
Charlie’s Place – Dupont Circle
Established in 1990, Charlie’s Place works year round to provide services like free bagged and hot meals, clothing distribution, medical care and haircuts to people experiencing homelessness in D.C. Charlie’s Place accepts volunteers, especially for early morning shifts, to assist in handing out and serving food to guests and to help collect and sort donated clothing supplies. A site supervisor will walk you through anything they need assistance with that day.
Food and Friends – Queens Chapel
As a nonprofit social services organization, Food and Friends delivers thousands of meals each week to DMV residents living with chronic illnesses that make it hard to access the nutritious meals they need. From Dec. 18 to Jan. 8, Food and Friends is looking for volunteers to help prepare and package meals for distribution. If you have access to a car or even a bike, you can also volunteer to deliver meals to clients across the DMV, with an average delivery route including six to 10 households.
A Wider Circle – Silver Spring, Md.
This nonprofit organization is focused on supporting people transitioning out of homeless shelters or out of domestic violence situations by donating household goods and furniture. A Wider Circle also works to mitigate poverty in low-income neighborhoods by providing financial management counseling, employment mentoring and housing search support. If you’re looking to volunteer in person, you can assist in sorting furniture and household items for distribution.
Students with expertise in job searches might consider volunteering virtually on group counseling workshops to guide job seekers through topics like networking. You could also make a remote volunteer impact by encouraging peers to collectively participate in the toy drive by simply ordering items from the nonprofit’s Amazon wishlist and having them delivered to A Wider Circle, which will distribute them to children in low-income situations.
Capital Area Food Bank – Fort Totten
From direct food distribution and educational resources on nutrition to cultivating gardens and mitigating the effects of food deserts in D.C., the Capital Area Food Bank works to create equitable food access in the city. The nonprofit is always seeking vaccinated volunteers to assist at its food distribution centers, gardens and through its grocery delivery system. Check out its calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming volunteer opportunities this month.
