Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights said at a Faculty Senate meeting in September that trustees spent the summer meeting with outside consultants to discuss how the University should approach shared governance.
The University’s shared governance task force will hold four town hall meetings this week to hear faculty input and help establish a definition of shared governance at GW.
David Maxwell, a senior consultant and fellow at the Association of Governing Boards, and Ann Franke, a former tenured general counsel of the American Association of University Professors, will facilitate the virtual town halls throughout the week, according to an email that officials sent to faculty last week. The email states the task force will use key themes from the town halls to develop a shared governance survey and hold a later town hall to discuss the survey results.
The meetings will take place Tuesday from 1 to 2:30 p.m., Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 3:30 p.m. and Thursday from 10:30 a.m. to noon, according to the email.
“Because faculty members are a key constituent in shared governance, we want to make sure we hear your views on what shared governance means and how it can best function at GW,” the email reads.
Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights said at a Faculty Senate meeting in September that trustees spent the summer meeting with outside consultants to discuss how the University should approach shared governance. She sent an email in May stating she had been “troubled” by some professors whose discourse did more to “foment discord” than contribute to civil dialogue leading up to former University President Thomas LeBlanc’s announcement that he would step down.
GW community members said a lack of shared governance came to define LeBlanc’s tenure as trust in his administration faltered and calls for his resignation grew.
The email states that the task force is comprised of three groups of trustees, faculty and administrators, each with four members.
Interim Provost Chirs Bracey, one of the task force’s co-chairs, Senior Vice Provost Terry Murphy, Columbian College of Arts and Science Dean Paul Wahlbeck and interim Deputy General Counsel Richard Weitzner make up the administration membership, according to the email.
The email states faculty include Christine Pitza, a professor of nursing, and faculty senators Shaista Khilji, a task force co-chair and professor of human and organizational learning and international affairs, Joe Cordes, a professor of economics and public policy and public administration, and Arthur Wilson, the chair of the senate’s executive committee and an associate professor of finance. Trustees Amr ElSawy, a task force co-chair, Mark Chichester, Madeleine Jacobs and Todd Klein will also serve on the task force, according to the email.
Officials will hold a retreat with administrators, trustees and members of the Faculty Senate’s executive committee to discuss the results of the survey before the task force takes its own retreat. Members of the task force will then develop a set of recommendations on how to strengthen shared governance at GW for the Board to approve at its meeting in May.
“We believe a common understanding of shared governance is an important part of the University’s academic mission and must inform proposals to build mechanisms and a culture that supports core principles of shared governance,” the email reads.

Ian Ching, the treasurer of the GW Chess Club, said he hopes the club can bring in more members who may have been turned off by the game’s perceived exclusivity. 
Updated: Jan. 18, 2022 at 6:26 p.m.
For many people, watching The Queen’s Gambit may have been the first time they were introduced to the ins and outs of a chess game. But the D.C. chess scene is alive and well, expanding in size and diversity, with a primary hub right outside the Foggy Bottom Metro station.
GW Chess Club has spent the last year organizing events and gathering with community members to play games. Members of the club said they enjoy D.C.’s chess scene for its diversity and community-building aspect, and they hope to continue eliminating barriers to the game, like intimidation and presumed exclusivity, for newcomers.
Ian Ching, the treasurer of GW Chess Club, helped put on the events and frequently visits the Foggy Bottom Metro station to play games.
“Over last spring we did play a lot with a local community here by the Foggy Bottom station, and I think we went there almost on a weekly, biweekly basis just to go play a few games,” Ching said.
Ching said the club hopes to continue to popularize chess within the GW community and draw in members who may have been deterred by the game’s perceived exclusivity.
“What we like to do at chess club is we do it on the tables at District so that anyone can come,” Ching said. “Versus if you put it into a room in District, someone has to open the door and walk in, and that’s a lot of times, that itself is going to be a barrier.”
Ching helped organize a simultaneous chess event this fall, a game in which one player faces multiple opponents at the same time. John Griffin, a community member who has been playing chess since 1960, played with 15 members of the club, winning 13 games and drawing in only two.
“It’s the mental challenge, trying to out-wit your opponent,” Griffin said. “It’s sort of like a war game. For some people it’s recreation. But if you do two things it’s about consistency. Play a lot. Study a lot.”
Justin Diamond, the president of GW Chess Club, attributes much of the club’s increase in membership over the past year to the popularity of the 2020 Netflix series, The Queen’s Gambit.
“The TV show probably did more for chess than anything in chess history,” Diamond said.
Diamond said he enjoys the analytical aspects of the game, and he studies the history of chess, his own prior games and chess tactics. He has also found chess has increased his focus because some of the skills necessary to be successful in chess like analytical thinking and patience translate well to academic settings.
“The best thing about chess is that it is really good for developing good study habits,” Diamond said. “My GPA has gone up pretty significantly with my chess rating. It helps your focus.”
After learning the basics as a kid, Diamond started playing chess again in 2020, coming to the Foggy Bottom Metro station daily to hone in his skill. It was there that he met Griffin, who helped teach him how to play the game and took him to his first tournament.
Simon Sholom, a GW Law alumnus and current DMV resident who’s involved in the D.C. chess scene, regained interest in chess again during retirement after only playing before college.
“The future of chess is young – also the young crowd is very diverse,” Sholom said. “A higher proportion of women than other age groups, a much higher proportion of all kinds of ethnic groups. That’s cool to see.”
Sholom has found that chess has a way of eliminating differences and bringing people together, and that is a big part of his love of the game.
“Once a game starts, it doesn’t matter who your opponent is,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if they are a 9-year-old-girl or some really old guy or what language they speak because the language you are speaking is on the chess board.”
When sophomore Maddie Bedard joined GW chess club, she was surprised to find she was not the only woman in the organization dedicated to a typically male-dominated game.
“I was shocked that I wasn’t the only woman in the team,” Bedard said. “I went in with that expectation that it’s going to be a bunch of guys, and I might be the lone wolf of the girl pack, but surprisingly there were a few girls. But definitely having another representation of women playing chess was soothing to see.”
This post has been updated to reflect the following correction:
A previous version of this article misspelled Simon Sholom’s name. His name is now correctly spelled. A previous version of this post also misstated a quote from Sholom. The quote is now updated.

The economic elite have successfully fabricated a new moral panic to further their political agenda: critical race theory, a discipline that studies how social structures like laws affect the livelihoods of certain racial identities.
The charge against critical race theory gained enormous traction when conservative pundit Christopher Rufo appeared on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” in summer 2020 to claim that critical race theory had “pervaded every aspect of the federal government” and was “being weaponized against core American values.” After Rufo’s appearance, Fox News mentioned critical race theory in its news segments nearly 4,000 times and made patently false claims about the discipline that have since become popular.
As a result of the controversy, 33 states have alarmingly either moved to restrict or ban the teaching of critical race theory in schools. Academics, as educators, have a responsibility to combat the repression of critical race theory along with misinformation surrounding the discipline. They should do so by institutionalizing critical race theory into their curricula. This is especially true of academics at GW, an institution that has a history of being influenced by economic interests. For example, GW’s Regulatory Studies Center, a University research center funded by Koch Industries and Exxon Mobil, almost universally “advocates against environmental regulation and relies primarily on researchers with ties to groups funded by the Koch family.”
The attack on critical race theory is a part of a larger effort to defund and restrict access to education, an attack funded in large part by elite economic interests. Koch Industries, the same fossil fuel interest that donates millions of dollars to the RSC, also invests millions of dollars into conservative think tanks – with the expectation that they will produce content about critical race theory designed to create confusion, distrust and anger. One Koch think tank author, for example, absurdly argued that the Stoneman Douglas shooting in 2018 was a result of critical race theory curricula at the high school.
Critical race theory falls under a broader academic discipline called critical theory, a framework that explores and challenges dominant social, economic and political structures. Critical theory seeks to critique, or thoroughly analyze, how these structures operate and determine how they can be most conducive to human flourishing. The father of critical theory, Max Horkheimer, an internationally renowned German sociologist and philosopher, notoriously distinguished critical theory from otherwise “traditional” theory. He argued that what makes a theory “critical” is it works “to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers of human beings.”
Critical race theory, a term coined by UCLA Professor of Law Kimberlé Crenshaw using this method of structural analysis and inquiry, explores how racism is not merely a concern of individual prejudice but that the foundational features of various social, economic and political structures produce circumstances that make it harder for people of color to flourish compared to their white counterparts. Educational institutions like GW bear the responsibility to take an authoritative stance against disinformation, especially when the disinformation perpetuates historical discrimination and racism.
One important step the GW community can take in the effort to combat the attack on critical race theory and the influence of interests like Koch Industries is to institutionalize critical race teachings into the curricula. Several of GW’s peer institutions, like Tufts and Tulane universities and the University of Pittsburgh, have required racial equity courses for graduation.
Critical race theory may seem complicated or abstract, but even those not attuned to the theory already use core tenets of it to inform our analysis of our everyday life. For example, it is public knowledge that Black people are incarcerated at a higher rate than their non-Black counterparts – not because there is an explicit law requiring this or because prisons across the country conspired to incarcerate more Black people. Instead, critical race theory research has enlightened researchers to consider how less obvious social phenomena like housing segregation, economic inequality and lack of access to education can create these conditions. Restorative policies that would provide the necessary decades-overdue reparations to rectify these environmental inequalities are heavily repressed, back then when white segregationists claimed discussions of race were racist and now where some are claiming the same. By institutionalizing the study of critical race theory, GW would be better equipping their students to create and hold those discussions about justice.
From social science to STEM, there is no discipline that has been unaffected by the consequences of systemic racism. And it would serve us better as community members and as academics to better understand how our disciplines have been racialized and influenced by racial disparities. The University clearly acknowledges an academic benefit to critical thinking, as it mandates three critical thinking courses in the social sciences and humanities. Administrators should specify one of the critical thinking course requirements to be a course on race. Additionally, professors in all disciplines should try to incorporate how race has affected the course topic.
Economic interests should not be deterministically influencing educational curriculum, and it is alarming that they have been so successful in their dissemination of false information. Rufo unsurprisingly later admitted that the campaign against critical race theory was not about understanding the framework as it has been used in academic research but rather “recodify[ing] it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with Americans.” This attack on critical race theory is not about a critique of its method or an academic engagement with the work – it is an attack on the core principle that we should be critical of dominant power structures and work to change them if they don’t promote human flourishing. With incoming generations being exposed and conditioned to false information about such a crucial academic framework like critical race theory, ensuring students understand how to critically think about race and racial systems is not only necessary but moral.

GW played without several key members of the lineup, including graduate student forward Ty Moore and junior guard Nya Lok. 
Women’s basketball lost their second straight conference game against Rhode Island Wednesday night.
The Colonials (7-8, 0-2 A-10) fell to the Rams (12-3, 2-0 A-10) in a 73–42 defeat. The Colonials were undermanned throughout the night, enduring the absence of several starters due to health and safety protocols.
Among the notable absences from the lineup were graduate student forward Ty Moore, graduate student guard Kyara Frames, junior guard Nya Lok and junior guard Essence Brown. The quartet has combined for a total of 1,187 minutes through 15 games played this year.
In their stead, freshman guard Leila Patel saw her first career start, and sophomore guard Piper Macke and freshman forward Sophie Haydon both set a career high in minutes played with 10 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively. Freshman guard Maxine Engel nearly matched a career high of 21 minutes played with 20 minutes on the night.
“Unfortunately, there’s things outside of our control,” Head Coach Caroline McCombs said. “So who we had today was who was able to compete tonight.”
Graduate student guard Dez Elmore spearheaded the Rams’ onslaught with a double-double, racking up 18 points and 10 rebounds. Sophomore guard Dolly Cairns and redshirt senior forward Emmanuelle Tahane also netted 14 points each to boost the Rhode Island offense.
“They’re just a very good team,” McCombs said. “They have a very experienced team as well. So we had different players in different roles, and they haven’t been practicing those for the last two days. So we had a lot of people just in different positions that they’re not necessarily used to.”
In the Colonials’ camp, junior guard Sheslanie Laureano and sophomore guard Aurea Gingras led the squad with nine points apiece.
With so many inexperienced players on the court, GW was overwhelmed and outgunned throughout the night, beginning in the first quarter.
After an early turnover by redshirt junior forward Mayowa Taiwo, she played tough defense, forcing a poor shot by a Rams player before blocking a pass to spring Gingras on the fastbreak and lay the ball in to give GW the first bucket of the game with 9:14 left in the quarter.
But following the opening basket, the Colonials quickly fell behind and remained so for the rest of the game.
By the end of the first quarter, GW was already down by double digits, trailing by a score of 22–8.
The Colonials struggled with shooting throughout the opening quarter, converting just 3-of-16 from the field. The Rams capitalized on GW’s poor shot selection, snagging 13 rebounds to GW’s six.
Rhode Island continued to press their lead in the second quarter, opening with a 7-2 scoring run, highlighted by a 3-pointer on the fast break by Cairns with 7:42 left in the half.
After falling behind by 19 points, McCombs called a timeout with 6:51 remaining in an attempt to rally her team. After a missed layup by Haydon, Laureano hit a trey to end the Rams’ scoring run.
But Rhode Island struck back quickly, hitting an 8-2 scoring run to prompt another timeout from GW with 2:22 left to play. Again, the Colonials answered out of the timeout but succumbed to the Rams offense once more and trailed heading into the locker room 39–19.
Rhode Island dominated in the paint, accumulating 18 points compared to GW’s 10 in the first half. They also controlled the game off the boards, snatching 26 rebounds to the Colonials’ 14, including 20 defensive rebounds to limit GW to just three second-chance points in the whole half.
“I just think people were in different roles so we’ve never experienced that before,” McCombs said. “I thought just competing, getting on the floor for loose balls, making hustle plays – I think that’s something that we can do. That doesn’t take any skill. That’s just effort. And we continually challenge them throughout the game to be able to do that.”
The Colonials finished the half shooting just 25 percent from the field and 9.1 percent from beyond the arc, sinking just 1-of-11 3-point attempts. Meanwhile, the Rams netted 54.8 percent from the floor and 50 percent from deep.
The second half opened a little tighter as both teams traded baskets, but Rhode Island again established their dominance. The Rams built up a 33-point lead following a pair of free throws by Elmore and a score of 62-29 by the end of the third quarter.
The Colonials improved their shooting in the second half, hitting 9-of-27 from the floor but could not find a way to slow down the Rams offense.
Rhode Island earned their largest lead of the game of 35 points with 5:32 left in the game and a score of 68–33. The Colonials put together a trio of 3-point buckets, a pair from Patel and a single from Gingras, to close out the game, but it was ultimately not enough to overcome the sizable deficit.
“It’s just understanding what it is like to play a game, because some of our players don’t always get that opportunity, and being able to bring that now to practice,” McCombs said. “The normal level of competition can be raised because they get to experience that. And again just playing against a really good team today we were able to see those things.”
The Colonials will prepare for a road game against Fordham Wednesday. Tipoff is set for 7 p.m.

Bennett Clifford, a co-author of the report, said the team collaborated with the geography department to determine each rioter’s residence. 
A year after a mob of rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, a GW research institute’s report compiling demographics on the more than 700 defendants federally charged in connection to the insurrection has gained national attention.
Research fellows from the Program on Extremism – a research center that analyzes forms of domestic and international extremism – published a report earlier this month detailing the age, gender, residence, political ideologies, extremist group affiliations and military history of 704 defendants who allegedly stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. The New York Times, ABC News and the Boston Globe cited the report’s data to add statistical evidence to their news stories and social media posts about the insurrection’s one-year anniversary.
Bennett Clifford, a co-author of the report and a senior research fellow at the extremism program, said the 48-page report combines the arrest information from each insurrectionist’s court records with statistics from the program’s Capitol Hill Siege online database, which includes the percentage of rioters who pleaded guilty.
He said the team of researchers used the U.S. Department of Justice’s public court record system to access the available indictments of each defendant and worked with the geography department to determine the geographical origin of each rioter.
“Our main goal in putting that data out there is for people to be able to compare what other folks are saying about it to see what really holds muster or not because it’s one of the few primary source databases about what happened on Jan. 6 that’s available to the public,” he said.
Clifford said the report’s data shows how domestic extremism within the United States has become increasingly common in recent years because social media allows online extremist communities to easily share ideologies with one another.
He said only about 11 percent of the insurrectionists held ties to domestic violent extremist groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers prior to Jan. 6, and 11% possessed military experience. Men made up 87 percent of the total number of charged defendants, according to the report.
“It’s less important nowadays to understand what groups look like or what organizations look like and more important to understand what ideologies, what narratives and what trends look like in terms of the future of domestic violence and extremism,” Clifford said.
Alex Mallin, a DOJ reporter for ABC News, said he and other reporters used the database to report on the common factors among the rioters at the insurrection, including residential states, prior military involvement and previous federal charges. He said the data showed that the rioters were diverse in ideologies, geographic origin and demographics.
Of the 704 defendants, 135 have been between 20 and 29 years old at the time of their arrests, 189 between ages 30 and 39 and 141 between ages 40 and 49, according to the report.
“I think you obviously have to start from the ground up and look at the people who have been arrested and charged with the most violent crimes ranging from assault on officers down to the small misdemeanor cases of people who just walked into the Capitol and didn’t cause any damage,” Mallin said.
Maillin said journalists were able to gain a detailed understanding of the insurrectionists’ geographic diversity because the report showed that insurrectionists came from 45 U.S. states with a majority of them hailing from Florida and Texas. He said journalists who have covered the insurrection’s investigations haven’t have the time to analyze every court record belonging to those charged in connection to Jan. 6, but they could instead refer to the report for the insurrectionists’ demographic information.
“It’s invaluable for not just reporters but for the public and for historians who want to document this really singular event,” he said.
Experts in domestic terrorism and extremism said they found the report comprehensive because it included new national security strategies like the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, which the federal government created in response to Jan. 6, in addition to the insurrectionists’ demographic diversity.
Matthew Kriner, a senior research scholar at the Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism at Middlebury College in Vermont, said the report showed how Jan. 6 was a “wakeup call” for the federal government because federal officials prioritized combatting international terrorism over domestic terrorism and extremism prior to the insurrection. He said the current federal investigation into the insurrection is the largest of its kind in U.S. history.
He said while past patterns of racially motivated militia activity resurged in the early 2010s with the emergence of domestic extremist groups, the constant change in these groups’ ideologies ultimately confused law enforcement officials and prevented them from identifying the Jan. 6 insurrectionists’ rise to extremism before the attack on the Capitol.
“If you’re expecting one thing to come, but in reality it looks entirely different but sounds similar, then you’re going to have a harder time adjusting to that change in the ecosystem,” he said.
The cases of the charged defendants were split into categories based on each defendant’s level of involvement with militant and domestic extremist groups, with 36% of defendants classified as inspired believers – or people who traveled alone to the Capitol – and 34 percent as organized clusters – people who planned to riot with family and friends. 9% were categorized as part of militant networks, which were the domestic extremist groups that gave direct commands to attack, according to the report.
Bruce Hoffman, a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the report dispels misinformation surrounding Jan. 6, like exaggerations of the role that active military service members played in the insurrection or the claim that Jan. 6 was not a significant political event.
“You have some people who view it as an insurrection for which some of the most senior elected officials in the United States played a role in,” he said. “Then you have others that diminish its significance or will argue that it was as one congressperson said ‘just like another tourist visit on the Hill.’”

The Colonials rode a three-game winning streak last season to finish nonconference play but ultimately finished their abbreviated 2020 campaign at .500.
Lacrosse announced its spring 2022 season schedule last Monday.
The season is set to begin on Saturday, Feb. 19 as the team hits the field at Annapolis to face off against Navy. The team will look to improve during Head Coach Jennifer Ulehla’s second full season at the helm, following a 6-6 record last year and a 0-7 record in 2020 in which the team was not able to play its conference slate.
The Colonials are set to play their first three nonconference matches away where they will play against Villanova and UMBC. After a four-day break, GW will return to the Mount Vernon Campus March 2 where they will take on crosstown rival American to wrap up their slate of nonconference matches at home.
After another four-day break, the Colonials are set to play against another crosstown rival, this time Georgetown on March 12, with the location still to be determined. The final two nonconference matches will be played at the Vern where the Colonials will face off against Kennesaw State and Longwood.
Last year, GW finished its condensed nonconference schedule with an overall record of 3-2, winning three straight games against Old Dominion, American and Longwood.
Atlantic 10 conference play will begin in North Carolina as the Colonials take on Davidson. GW will return from a four-day break to duel Richmond at home.
The Colonials will once again take the road to Philadelphia where they will play against La Salle. Holding a two-day break where they will return to D.C. for the last home game for the following week, they will face off against St. Bonaventure.
GW will begin a three-game road swing where it will visit Massachusetts, George Mason and Saint Joseph’s in a period of a week beginning April 8.
The Colonials will return home to finish their last two matches where they will play against Duquesne and VCU hoping to set the final necessary points to qualify for the championship. Last season, GW concluded the conference slate with an overall record of 3-4, causing them to miss the postseason.
GW has neither earned a winning record nor made the postseason since the 2013 season, in which they secured a 9-8 record before losing to No. 13 Massachusetts 13-5 in the semifinals of the A-10 Championship.
This year, the A-10 Championship will take place in Amherst, Mass. from April 28 until May 1, where the Colonials will compete for a spot in the NCAA Tournament, seeking their first berth since 2007.

Mark Wrighton has spent his first few weeks as interim president meeting with a variety of GW community members to prepare to confront the biggest challenges facing the University. 
If you wake up before sunrise, you may see interim University President Mark Wrighton walking his dog, Spike, around campus to start his day.
Wrighton, who moved into the F Street House Friday as GW’s third president to reside on campus, said he starts his morning at 4:45 a.m. – part of his new daily routine on the Foggy Bottom Campus. After exercising, Wrighton said his workday starts at 8 a.m. with daily pandemic-related meetings with GW’s Medical Advisory Group, which has decided on major moves like the University’s return to in-person classes Tuesday.
“I’m really very proud of the work that so many people are doing to assure that we are safe and healthy,” Wrighton said in his first interview as president.
In addition to Spike, the F Street House will be home to another furry friend – a cat whom Wrighton nicknamed “Purrfessor.”
He said he hopes his daughter, a School of Business alumna who lives in the area, will bring his grandchildren to stay with him and his wife as they settle into the neighborhood.
“We’re hoping that they will come and visit us and maybe even stay the night, and I’ll encourage them to prowl around with me,” Wrighton said of his grandchildren.
Wrighton’s first two weeks on the job have consisted of regular meetings with senior administrators, trustees, faculty leaders and D.C. government officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser for introductions and discussions on the pandemic.
After seven fall campus visits to prepare for the role, Wrighton began his tenure on Jan. 1, taking a campus tour to mark his first day. The following Tuesday, he convened GW’s deans and senior administrators for a two-hour meeting to overview challenges the University faces in connection with the pandemic.
Wrighton said last week’s remote instruction had gone “very well,” but with in-person social events and other gatherings still restricted through at least Jan. 31, he is “anxious” for the normal college experience to resume. The University’s daily total positive COVID-19 cases reached an all-time high on Jan. 5 with 196 cases, and Bowser reinstated the District’s public health emergency last week.
“The good news is that the positivity rate right now seems to be on the decline in the D.C. environment, and our own testing program is really top notch,” he said, pointing to his recent negative test result from GW’s in-house lab.
Beyond the University-wide leadership discussions, Wrighton has also convened individual meetings with administrators, including the provost, chief financial officer, vice presidents and all of GW’s deans. He said he discussed GW’s contributions to D.C.’s pandemic response in his meeting with Bowser.
“My days here in Washington have been extremely full,” Wrighton said.
Wrighton said he attended an executive committee meeting of the Board of Trustees last week after joining a Faculty Senate executive committee meeting the previous Friday. The next day, he cheered on the men’s basketball team at its game against Dayton, receiving special permission to attend the match even with a pandemic-related ban on spectators.
Wrighton called the experience “incredibly impressive,” saying he had never worked at a school with Division I teams, and he plans to attend future games once fans are allowed back in the stands.
“I use those opportunities for informal interactions, and it helps me to understand what’s on people’s minds,” he said.
At his second game on Monday, Wrighton was embraced by the men’s basketball team after their win against George Mason.

Wrighton said he plans to make building the University’s financial aid resources a priority during his tenure.
Officials launched an initiative in October to make GW more financially accessible for Pell-eligible students, and Wrighton said he has been in conversation with Donna Arbide, the vice president for development and alumni relations, to push those efforts forward. Wrighton also said he attended a GW alumni event in St. Louis before starting as president.
He said his top priorities also include improving diversity, equity and inclusion at GW and helping in the fight against climate change.
“We want to continue to strengthen diversity, build an inclusive community and provide equity in terms of resources that are needed to have the top-notch educational experience and college experience that we want for all of our students,” Wrighton said.
He said he was excited by the “outstanding” academic leaders he saw at GW when he visited in the fall. Wrighton, who started a public health program at Washington University at St. Louis, said the Milken Institute School of Public Health is a “premier” program with “considerable potential.”
He added that he was excited to broaden his experience in foreign relations at the Elliott School of International Affairs, a school he called “one of the most outstanding programs in the country.”
“There are things here that I really need to learn more about before I can help prioritize the academic agenda, but there are really talented people who’ve been here for a while and will help me learn, and I will look forward to that,” he said.
Wrighton said ongoing updates to campus buildings like Thurston Hall can serve as an opportunity for officials to improve heating and cooling systems in the buildings, both in the interest of saving money and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
“We need to be attentive to our expense structure so we can do something positive in connection with carbon dioxide emissions and also lower the operating costs of our facilities,” he said.
Last semester, faculty senators called for officials to release more information about the timeline for updates to HVAC systems made in hopes of limiting the spread of COVID-19 in light of concerns that officials spread “misinformation” about the timeline.
Wrighton said he shared a positive relationship with former University President Thomas LeBlanc – whose tenure was marked by GW’s pandemic response and a growing mistrust between him and the GW community – and Wrighton met with him almost every time he was in the District last fall during the presidential transition.
He said LeBlanc’s leadership handling the pandemic has served the community well, adding that he helped acquaint Wrighton with “many of the issues the University has been facing.”
“We had a good relationship,” Wrighton said. “I think he had some challenges, and he shared pretty openly how I might avoid some of the same kinds of difficulties.”
Student Association Vice President Kate Carpenter said Wrighton met with her and Student Association President Brandon Hill once in October to discuss top issues for the student body, like climate change.
“I see lots of interaction on social media, which is great, and also just a buzz around campus about what this new administration will look like even though it is just for 18 months,” she said, pointing to Wrighton’s active Twitter account. “And I really do encourage everyone to go in with an open mind and really just hold him accountable but also understand that he’s excited to be here on campus.”
I am proud to join The George Washington University community as we begin the third century of a great institution! Today, Jan 1, is my first day as President; toured the campus on foot.

Harald Griesshammer, a faculty senator and associate professor of physics, said at a Faculty Senate meeting Friday that based on Wrighton’s resume, his role at the University for the next 18 months will be to re-establish “good relations” within the GW community and to lay the groundwork for a permanent leader. Wrighton will have to address issues like faculty concerns about a lack of GW Information Technology staff, Griesshammer said.
“You have a lot on your plate, it’s a job that I don’t envy you about, but I would like to work with you and I think everybody would really like to work with you,” Griesshammer said to Wrighton at the meeting.

GW marked its 200th year with a tradition it needs to abolish: appointing only white men to the presidency. On Jan. 1, 2022, Mark Wrighton was appointed interim president of GW, and it was incredibly disappointing to see that most of the student body will not be represented, once again.
A total of 21 permanent or interim presidents have led the University and not a single one of them has reflected the students of color and nonmale students that attend GW. This is by no means a problem unique to GW – only about 5 percent of university presidents in the United States are women of color. But the Board of Trustees has a responsibility to break the cycle of excluding marginalized people from the top position at higher education institutions and choose a president that comes from at least one marginalized group.
Historical stereotypes and oppression continue to influence the way society views marginalized groups by creating implicit biases. This is an issue of systemic sexism and racism – whether it is intentional or not – and the Board must be conscious of their biases in their search for a permanent leader.
Women are often kept out of leadership positions because of the belief that women are not as fit to lead or that they are too authoritative and emotional. Women make up half of the U.S. workforce and receive more bachelor’s and master’s degrees than men. Yet, women only hold approximately 8 percent of CEO positions by optimistic estimates.
Whether it is seeing women as less competent or simply less likeable, these biases play a large role in the fact that fewer women are in positions of leadership than men. Patriarchal expectations: women staying at home with children and being more emotional than men contribute to society’s bias toward seeing women as inferior. Lack of gender equality creates a false narrative that female leadership is not normal nor acceptable. History is marked with men in most leadership positions because of these hurtful stereotypes – and GW must not buy into it.
The presidential search committee must be aware of its implicit biases against women that have been ingrained in every single human without consciously knowing about them. They also need to actively fight against those biases by prioritizing the appointment of a more diverse president in the upcoming selection. Everyone has implicit biases based on what they have experienced and been taught, so none of this is to say that GW is making the purposeful decision to be sexist. But failing to recognize those biases is what perpetuates them and continuing to appoint men to positions of power will never get rid of those biases.
In a 2019 study conducted by Coqual, a nonprofit think tank and advisory group, 65 percent of Black professionals agreed that Black employees have to work harder to advance while only 16 percent of white professionals said the same. Examples of discrimination that people of color experience in the workforce include racially insensitive language, being perceived as angry or not as intelligent and exclusion from events. This is what perpetuates the harmful biases that society has against people of color and the presidential search committee must be aware of them in their search for a new leader.
Not having a single president of color over the past two centuries comes from racist biases that must be recognized by the presidential search committee. None of this is to say that the Board is being intentionally discriminatory, but moving forward it is important to reflect on the implicit biases that have descended from years of stereotypes and how they shape the University’s decision-making process to not let them affect the next presidential appointment.
Minority students need to see themselves in leadership positions to encourage them to go onto their own leadership positions. Approximately 17 percent of enrolled students were white men in 2021, yet they have been represented in the GW presidency 100 percent of the time, according to the Office of Institutional Research and Planning.
Equal and proportional representation of the student body is important because the president makes decisions that greatly affect all students, including students of color and nonmale students. White men do not face systemic oppression like their counterparts, meaning they do not have any inherent or innate understanding of how the University’s policies could discriminate against students.
In the search for a permanent president, the search committee must prioritize diverse candidates that better reflect the University’s student body. Students should express similar sentiments when officials shortly begin the process of asking for student input on the search process. Demanding and putting more pressure to select a more inclusive president will leave little room for the Board to appoint another white man.
While Board Chair Grace Speights has said the search for a permanent president will focus on inclusion, Wrighton’s appointment does not reflect that statement, and it is imperative that the next selection fall in line with what has been promised. To support students of color and nonmale students, Wrighton must consult them as well as officials that are minorities.
White men have had more than their fair share of the presidency at GW, and it is now time for others to take on that role. The Board needs to reevaluate their implicit biases and work toward eliminating them by appointing a president that is a person of color, not a man or both.
