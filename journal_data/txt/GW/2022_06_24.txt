Thousands protested outside the Supreme Court Friday after they released their decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, rolling back federal abortion protections. 
Thousands of people rallied to protest the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade this weekend, a ruling that ends federal abortion protections and will usher in a new era of reproductive rights rollbacks.
Crowds built up outside the courthouse ahead of the 10:10 a.m. release of the landmark decision Friday before surging past at least three thousand people later in the afternoon and into Saturday. Protesters demanded that the federal government find alternate ways to protect abortion and bashed the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which leaves the right to an abortion up to the states, as an attack on human rights and a disregard for public will.
Last month, POLITICO published a leaked draft opinion to strike down Roe v. Wade, sparking a crowd of around 500 people to protest at the Supreme Court that night. Students continued to protest at the court in the following week and student organizations like Swing Left GW condemned the draft opinion on social media and encouraged students to vote for pro-choice candidates.
Laurel Downie, a protester at the court, said poor women and women of color are disadvantaged by the decision because women of privilege will always have access to abortion regardless of the Supreme Court decision.
“This decision is putting women who are poor, women who are marginalized, in potentially lethal situations without their consent,” Downie said.
She said the Supreme Court is “outdated” and should not have life-long tenure because it had already established a stance on abortion when they were installed.
During their confirmation hearings, all six Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade said they viewed the case’s ruling and subsequent Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, which reaffirmed Roe, as precedent.
Downie said abortion-rights organizers should focus on organizing locally because much of abortion-rights organizing is aimed toward the federal government and less attention is given to municipal governments. She said Washington, D.C. should be able to make its own decisions and be a “safe haven” for women who need healthcare.
Renee Bracey Sherman, a protester at the court and founder and executive director of We Testify, a national organization representing people that have had abortions, said the Court’s decision is “horrifying” and will restrict the rights to healthcare across the country. 
Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion and stated that decisions pertaining to abortion protections should be left up to elected officials.
Associate Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion and stated that women should be respected as an “autonomous being” and be able to have an abortion if they choose.
Bracey Sherman said restricted abortion access is a public health emergency, and people should share their abortion stories and donate to clinics who provide abortions.
“Don’t try and recreate the wheel,” Bracey Sherman said. “Show up where folks have been organizing and just ask how you can get involved.”
Norah McCormick, who is seven months pregnant with her first child, said she has a “high degree of empathy” for how financially, physically and mentally taxing the process can be and would “never force pregnancy or birth” on anyone who didn’t want it.
She said she is having a boy and hopes he will advocate for justice, despite not being born into a world where Roe v. Wade is still considered constitutional by the Supreme Court.
“My mother had more rights than I do,” McCormick said. “It’s unbelievable that I’ll have known Roe in my lifetime but my son may not. I hope to teach him some of the values that were instilled in me, and I hope he’ll fight for justice.”
She said she attended March for Women’s Lives in 2004, which shaped her current view that people should have a right to choose to have an abortion.
“We were out here marching for a right that we already had,” McCormick said. “To see that stripped away today again, for millions of women, I just thought I can’t stay at home and be silent and be sad. I have to come out and continue to stand up for what I believe in.”
Kate Hoeting, the managing editor of Catholics for Choice, said fellow protesters who saw her Catholic organization’s abortion-rights signs were surprised and emotional, with some even breaking down into tears.
“The moment of people literally just seeing those three words ‘Catholics for Choice’ bursting into tears just so much shows how many people of faith are really vocal and supportive of abortion access, and they can feel like they’re alone. So we’re here to say, ‘you’re not alone’ and it’s time to speak up.”
The crowd drew shouting matches between protesters and counter-protesters, who celebrated the Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and more than a hundred Capitol police officers were present at the protest. The Metropolitan Police Department was also fully deployed.
Waleed Haider, a protester at the court, said he decided to protest to remind Americans to consider the Islamic belief that a woman has control over her fetus and her body. He said both Muslims and non-Muslims need to come together to give women the basic right to an abortion.
“We have to protect it from the Supreme Court which has been attacking women’s rights as we’ve seen with this decision today,” Haider said.

The Colonials moniker had slowly lost visibility on campus during the past several years as the University distanced itself from the nickname.
One week after officials announced GW will drop the nearly century-old Colonials moniker, advocates for the change welcomed the decision and potential alternative nicknames while others derided the move with demands that the moniker stay. 
The commitment to replace the moniker by the 2023-24 academic year sparked controversy across social media, where users offered up new nicknames like the Hippos, River Horses or Revolutionaries, as national news coverage from The Washington Post and Fox News further fueled nationwide discourse. More than half a dozen students, alumni and faculty members said the change was the “right decision” after years of student advocacy to replace the moniker due to its connections to slavery, colonialism and racial discrimination.
When alumna Georgie Britcher joined Students for Indigenous and Native American Rights as a freshman in 2018, she also joined a growing movement committed to replacing GW’s nearly century-old Colonials moniker, a nickname the student organization deemed “extremely offensive.” Four years later – after leading town hall discussions, signing petitions and meeting with administrators – Britcher said she was moved to tears after learning GW will retire the Colonials moniker. 
The decision comes nearly two years after officials appointed Britcher and 14 other students, alumni and faculty members to the Special Committee on the Colonials Moniker to examine the historical context of the nickname.
“It was the first time I felt like ‘Oh, my gosh, this work was not for nothing,’” Britcher said. “All of the tears, all of the microaggressions, all of the straight-up racism, all of the straight-up erasure – it was not for nothing.”
The Colonials moniker was slowly losing visibility on campus prior to last week’s retirement of the moniker, which officials wiped from various campus spaces and events. Protests against the moniker gained momentum in 2018 when a student-led petition that demanded officials abandon the Colonials moniker garnered nearly 550 signatures.
The Student Association held a referendum on the moniker in spring 2019, finding about 54 percent of students in favor of its removal. In response, former SA President SJ Matthews issued an executive order in September 2019 establishing the student-run Colonial Moniker Task Force to research possible replacements for the moniker. 
Britcher, who has Cayuga and Iroqouis heritage, served as the only Indigenous student on the Special Committee on the Colonials Moniker – a group created nearly two years ago. She said she felt pressured to represent every Indigenous students’ perspective in her sole testimonies. 
Britcher said she faced assumptions and micro-aggressions from the committee, like being interrupted while speaking about her personal experiences as an Indigenous student at GW.
Britcher said she met several other Indigenous students at GW by bonding over discussions about the University’s roots in colonialism or protesting for the moniker’s retirement. She said she hopes Indigenous students in the future can graduate from GW without having the Colonials moniker “stand in their way.”
“I am glad I was able to meet those people so we can make that change and so we can ensure that there can be a Native community without that feeling that we have to be brought together by something of hate, but rather by love,” Britcher said.
André Gonzales – a 2020 graduate and the chair of the student-led Colonial Moniker Task Force, a committee dedicated to researching possible replacements for the moniker – said it was a “beautiful” and “emotional” day when he heard the University would retire the Colonials moniker. He said he hopes the change will lead to a larger discussion about how to make GW more inclusive and accessible to all identities. 
“I think that’s really where the change is,” Gonzales said. “It’s an institution, it’s a university saying, ‘You know what, we’re going to make this a community that we can all kind of rally around.’”
Gonzales, who is affiliated with the Comanche and Genízaro tribes, said the conversations among students, faculty and administrators during the evaluation process were “confrontational” and “emotionally draining” for the Indigenous students involved in the discussions. 
He said due to the student body’s low representation of Indigenous identities, he was concerned the administration wouldn’t have many opportunities to discuss the moniker with an Indigenous student, causing him to be more honest and direct about his stance.
“At times it required having to be more upfront or confrontational, more blunt in how we talked about things or in how we address certain things,” Gonzales said.
University spokesperson Tim Pierce said the task force and the special committee acknowledged all perspectives in their discussions concerning the Colonials moniker. 
“The Special Committee represented GW’s diverse constituencies, but also considered all viewpoints before making its recommendation,” Pierce said in an email. “The Task Force on Naming approached its work with both intellectual rigor and deep compassion for the individuals who will be impacted by the university’s decisions on name change requests.”
Ashley Le, the SA president during the 2018-19 academic year, said the debate about the moniker started as a small conversation among students before she was elected and gathered momentum as more students began to recognize it as an issue. She said she partnered with other student leaders to create the first “Hippo Day” – a day of music, food and prizes – in an attempt to move attention away from the Colonials moniker. 
Le said the debate surrounding the moniker needs to acknowledge the cultures that the “Colonials” label has offended due to its discriminatory connections. 
“It’s speaking about the experience of a group of people who have been hurt and persecuted through years of American existence, and yet the namesake of our mascot brought up even more pain and it should not be a small conversation anymore,” Le said. “It should not be a conversation between a small group of students anymore.”
Le said she hopes the official retirement of the moniker serves as an apology to Indigenous students who felt misrepresented by the Colonial nickname. 
“I hope that it will say to students who have long felt like they don’t belong, that they felt that the mascot name of the University is offensive to the history of where they come from – I hope that they will take this as an apology,” Le said.
David Silverman, a professor of history specializing in colonial American and Native American history and a member of the Special Committee on the Colonials Moniker, wrote a report on the history of colonialism in the United States as part of his role on the committee to provide a historical perspective to the conversation surrounding the moniker. 
Silverman said the reality of colonial American history, which was often romanticized during the early 20th century when the moniker was adopted, was that it included the loss of land, lives and autonomy of Indigenous people and the transatlantic slave trade – “one of the most significant human rights disasters in world history.”
“The perspective of our society has moved from one that was, quite frankly, grounded in white supremacy to one that is now, we hope, far more inclusive and critical of the history that produced white supremacy,” he said. 
While student sentiment in response to the announcement has been largely positive, some student organizations have come out in firm opposition to the upcoming name change. 
GW College Republicans released a statement on its Instagram account where members said they were “extremely disappointed” about the moniker change. 
Jackson Hoppe, a rising sophomore and the director of public relations for GW College Republicans, said the removal of the moniker erases the memory of those who fought for the country, and the Colonials moniker represents those “who fought against colonialism.”
Hoppe said the organization is concerned that this decision could “snowball” into a University name change, which members oppose. Officials have clarified on multiple occasions that they will not change the name of the University. 
“We believe that the moniker itself, we don’t believe that it upholds colonialism, we believe it’s meant to honor the colonists in the Revolutionary War who fought in the creation of our nation against tyrannical colonialism,” he said.

What’s in a name? Continentals, Revolutionaries, Riverhorses and, of course, Hippos – these are just some of the contenders vying to replace the Colonials moniker now that the Board of Trustees has decided to retire the University’s branding backbone by the 2023-2024 academic year. The moniker has been an indisputable part of GW’s culture and community for nearly a century, but it’s also excluded Black, Indigenous, international and other students who have explicitly said GW’s moniker makes them uncomfortable. They’re right to challenge the University’s Colonials brand, which became official as early as 1926. Colonials isn’t an homage to George Washington’s bravery – it’s a rose-tinted celebration of the racist violence of colonial America that began amid the nadir of American race relations during the 1920s.
The moniker and what it represents is a disservice to an institution with a self-proclaimed global outlook and progressive student body. A desire to preserve the moniker out of some sense of tradition or nostalgia for a “colonial” America replete with tricorn hats, muskets and patriots can’t trump what we know about that period nor supersede the need for students to feel welcome at this University. History has saddled GW with a brand that fails to reflect its values, and changing the Colonials moniker now would rectify that grave mistake. Moving past the Colonials moniker represents a massive step forward in creating a campus culture and spirit that can make all members of the University community proud.
First, a quick recap on how we got here. The Board made its decision following years of student activism and behind-the-scenes discussion. A student-led petition in 2018 called on officials to change the moniker and rename several University buildings, claiming that the moniker hurt GW’s reputation and was offensive to international students who have experienced the effects of colonialism. The following year, a narrow majority of students supported a Student Association referendum that reiterated the original petition’s goals. The Board and former President Thomas LeBlanc then outlined a framework for two renaming committees in 2019 and 2020, including one devoted to the Colonials moniker. The Board used the committee’s recommendations to reach its final decision to retire the moniker, taking us back to the present.
Just like the renaming committee, we should consider the moniker’s past to better understand it in the present. Sandwiched between an article admonishing the freshman class for wearing high school insignias and advertisements for typewriters, The Hatchet – which was not independent of the University at the time – unceremoniously announced what would become GW’s new moniker in a 1926 article. “Colonials,” with its direct appeal to the bygone era of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, would come to replace a series of disparate nicknames like “Hatchetites,” “Crummen” and “Axemen” that students had previously used.
Yet the notion that the Colonials moniker stems from some “precious heritage” of the late 18th and early 19th centuries wasn’t true then, and it certainly isn’t true now – there’s no real historical basis to the Colonials moniker. The nickname stems from the contemporary Colonial Revival movement, a conservative movement in art, architecture and culture that looked toward a mythologized version of America’s past amid the changing 1920s. Coinciding with this movement and the creation of the moniker was – as with much of American history – a widespread acceptance of white supremacy. In 1925 and 1926, tens of thousands of members of the Ku Klux Klan paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue, and Cloyd Heck Marvin – who would go on to defend and enforce the University’s policy of racial segregation (which the KKK supported) – became GW’s president in 1927. This is the atmosphere in which the Colonials moniker came to be.
All of that is to say that the Colonials moniker coincided with a popular interest with America’s colonial past, which involved the brutal conquest, subjugation and slavery of Indigneous and African peoples. Would that have occurred to GW students and officials at the time? Maybe, but given the contemporary tolerance for and even celebration of white supremacy during the 1920s, they likely supported, or at the very least ignored, the complex legacy of the storied “Colonials” whom they used to model themselves.
To avoid any misinterpretation, purposeful or otherwise, let me be clear – owning a Colonials t-shirt or other merchandise, singing our fight song or preferring our current moniker does not make you an avowed white supremacist. But we can’t ignore what the Colonials moniker was meant to represent nor the context in which both officials and students endorsed it.
That’s why my fellow peers, staff, faculty and alumni are right to challenge the Colonials branding as a deeply out of touch and unpleasant celebration of colonialism both in the United States and abroad. Because while other members of this community have been able to look past the moniker’s history and incorporate it as part of a shared identity – through no fault of their own, by the way – it’s simply too divisive for many people to rally behind. Students who supported the 2018 petition said it was hard to take pride in something so offensive and it completely undercut GW’s attempts to recruit students from outside the United States and Europe. They were right then, and they’re still right now.
We should be proud to be at GW, but we do not – and increasingly should not – take pride in being “Colonials.” Whatever personal attachment I or anyone else has to the moniker and its very, very complicated past shouldn’t outweigh the fact that every member of the University community deserves a moniker that embraces them and their heritage, not one that drives them away.

The Department of Education said Thursday it will reinstate Title IX regulations the Trump administration dumped in 2020.
The proposed changes consist of enhancements to protections against sexual discrimination in schools and altering the language to include sexual orientation and gender identity protections for LGBTQ+ students. Experts said the Trump administration’s changes to Title IX policy bolstered sexual violence assailants’ rights while gutting those of the survivor, and the newly proposed policies would reverse the previous administration’s Title IX rules.
“Those regulations weakened protections for survivors of sexual assault and diminished the promise of an education free from discrimination,” an education department release states.
The proposed updates, which must go through a public comment phase before final certification, would expand the definition of sex-based harassment in an effort to limit unwelcome sex-based conduct that could create a hostile environment.
“The proposed regulations reflect the Department’s commitment to give full effect to Title IX, ensuring that no person experiences sex discrimination in education, and that school procedures for addressing complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual violence and other forms of sex-based harassment, are clear, effective, and fair to all involved,” Catherine E.  Lhamon, the assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a release.
Transgender students’ protections would also be expanded under the proposed changes. Schools would also have to share their nondiscrimination policies with community members and increase protections for students who are pregnant or have pregnancy-related conditions, officials said in a release.
Federal officials said they would release separate rulemaking guidance around Title IX application to school athletic teams.
The language would keep some Trump-era changes, such as mandating schools presume that accused students are innocent until the procedures to investigate and evaluate students end and allow informal resolutions around sexual misconduct if both the accuser and accused agree on the allegations.
The proposed changes would also allow for schools to investigate and punish accused students for assaults that occur off-campus and permit Title IX investigators to determine the outcomes of cases as long as they have no conflict of interest.
Proposed updates to the Title IX policy came during the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Title IX educational amendments of 1972, which protect students from discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs and activities.
“Over the last fifty years, our nation has made monumental progress in advancing equity and equality for all students, including by narrowing gender gaps in sports, expanding opportunities in science and technology fields, and protecting students from sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment and sexual violence,” President Joe Biden said in a White House statement.

The spectrum of genres brought in a demographic where all could find two things in common – a love for music and an appreciation for the DMV.
Something in the Water delivered a series of show-stopping performances that rocked the District and united generations of hip-hop, rap, alternative and R&B legends in a celebration of DMV culture and community last weekend.
Tens of thousands of people streamed across Independence Avenue at the event’s D.C. debut with more than 60 musicians headlined by stars like Post Malone, Lil Baby, 21 Savage and Pharrell Williams – who founded the festival in Virginia Beach in 2019. The three-day music fest brought a hard-hitting musical display that locals hadn’t seen since the pre-pandemic era, and with an emphasis on diversity on the nation’s capital, the festival made for the perfect tribute to the spirit of D.C. culture and identity during the heat of Juneteenth weekend.
Just blocks from the U.S. Capitol, festival founder and award-winning producer Pharrell was purposeful with the weekend’s venue and diverse lineup, ensuring that music remained central to the commemoration of Juneteenth and emphasizing the cultural significance of music and art among communities of color.
I was able to make it to each day of the event, so I picked out my favorite standout performances that defined the full weekend that felt like a musical celebration of unity and love. Here are my highlights:
Friday
Festival go-ers arrived early on Friday to snag a front-row seat to Lucky Daye and Emotional Oranges, encompassing two of the best soul and R&B performances of the weekend.
Emotional Oranges – a previously anonymous duo from Los Angeles – entered wearing matching floral robes, setting the stage for a vibrant yet spiritual set.
Together they formed a unique alchemy of sound, using their signature faded base-like intro while the airy vocals of V, one of the pair of artists, complimented the thicker foundation of the sound of counterpart A. Performing songs like “Personal,” “All That” and “West Coast Love,” they brought a fresh performance to an otherwise hot and sticky crowd.
Next, Grammy-winner Lucky Daye ascended the stage serenading the crowd with “Candy Drip,” igniting his iconic soulful voice that bounced from falsetto to deeper, smoother baritone. Lucky seemed to instantly charm listeners who quickly fell in line with the groove of his sound.
A live band, consisting of a guitarist, drummer and pianist accompanied Lucky and supported the singer’s authentic sound that seemed to flow effortlessly. As he moved between more upbeat tracks such as “NWA” to slower ends with “Love You Too Much,” his aggressively deep vocals configured his sexual, yet tasteful movements on stage, taking the audience back to old-school funk sounds layered with a modern pop twist.
Saturday
Lil Uzi electrified the energy of the Saturday crowd with his chaotic, yet purposeful set. Placed against a bright pink thermal screen, Uzi needed nothing more than a DJ stand and a microphone to sprint on stage and stop to greet the crowd with a wink before leading into his first set.
Delivering one of the most energetic performances of the weekend, Uzi seemed to never stop running, bounding and bolting back and forth up and down center stage. He performed tracks from albums like “Luv is Rage 2” and “Eternal Atake” and showcased his ability to shift between punk rock, rap and hip hop while still keeping the audience enthralled in his tracks.
Later, one of the most meaningful moments of the weekend came as Pharrell rose from the center of the festival grounds through an ascending stage to kick off his set. The producer appeared with a black and white TV filter projected onto the screen behind him as he opened with his 2015 single, “Freedom.” As he paced back and forth, he paused between chorus lyrics to provide commentary about the “magic,” “camaraderie” and “love” he hoped people would welcome from the weekend.
Pharrell shared the emotion of the moment with the crowd, saying, “It’s a different feeling singing this song in front of the Capitol” and “They didn’t think we could do it, but all I see is love.”
His opening was powerful yet humble, resembling his profound influence within the music industry. Anyone who knows anything about Pharrell recognizes his humility and his desire to give back to his own community, and this venue and performance encapsulated just that.
As someone who revolutionized the sound behind hip hop in the late 90’s through producing, song writing and singing, Pharrell payed homage to his origins, bringing the sound of The Neptunes – the production duo that gave Williams his start – back to the stage. He reunited with revered artists of the early 2000s and surprised the crowd with the long-awaited performance of Clipse and N.O.R.E. before bringing out newly debuted lyricist and rapper Domani Harris.
As the main headliner, Pharrell opted for a minimalist backdrop of lights, nodding along with the beat and making his presence alone enough to command the magnitude of the stage. As one of the most successful producers in the industry, Pharrell’s performance seamlessly brought together older generations of tracks with today’s modern icons of music, demonstrating his effortless omnipresence.
Sunday
While rap and hip hop artists commanded much of the event throughout the weekend, R&B singer Teyana Taylor graced the stage Sunday night, adding the festival to one of her last tour spots before she officially retires from the industry after 15 years of work.
Teyana followed her dancers in a fiery red costume and silhouette with no difficulty summoning the attention of everyone in her vicinity as she embodied a Beyonce-style march entering the stage. While she maintained a position front and center for the entire set, she often fell in line with her dancers performing a choreography with an intricate storyline and robotic, hip-hop movements. She danced to revenge songs like “Bare Wit Me” while engaging in slower more physical acts for “Gonna Love Me,” but the physicality did not once distract from the depth and emotional range of her sound.
The three-day festival had something for everyone. Even though the summer timing of the event made it difficult for college students to attend, the festival instead catered toward middle-aged crowds. The spectrum of genres brought in a demographic where all could find two things in common – a love for music and an appreciation for the DMV.
As crowds celebrated the chance to experience the eclectic array of music, the event marked the return of a sense of normalcy after a nearly two-year break of festivals and large gatherings grounded in music just in time to celebrate the holiday weekend.

This week is all about finding the good where you can at GW and in D.C. Student volunteers rounded up a record number of donations through the University’s Green Move-Out Program, Metrorail’s 7000-series cars returned to the tracks and the fiercely competitive election that ultimately delivered Mayor Muriel Bowser’s third D.C.’s Democratic primary victory foreshadows a new – and better – direction for D.C.
But two trends, the University’s ongoing but increasingly dwindling response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the persistent epidemic of gun violence, continue to cast a shadow over this summer.
Here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up: 
Remember those brown boxes in the lobby of your residence hall in May? As part of GW’s Green Move-Out program, students donated more than 53,000 pounds of clothing, household items and food that they’d otherwise have thrown out to local charities like Habitat for Humanity of Metro Maryland and Bread for the City. Kudos to the student volunteers who spent 472 hours, or nearly 20 straight days, sorting out foodstuffs, clothing, organizers and other items for reuse and donation – it couldn’t have been an easy job. But how much stuff did students toss in the trash during move-out relative to what they donated? Either way, the important thing is that this year’s Green Move-Out kept otherwise usable items out of landfills, saved waste disposal fees and labor costs for the University and, most of all, helped local charities supply people with the items they need.
Turning to the District, eight 7000-series trains returned to Metro’s network last week nearly half a year after the transit agency pulled them from service due to a derailment in December 2021. Removing the 7000-series cars from operations severely reduced the size of Metro’s fleet, pushing up wait times between trains into the double digits. Their return to the tracks should make service more frequent and trains less crowded as workers come back to the office and tourist season heats up. While I’m glad to see the 7000-series running, it’s just about the bare minimum – Metro’s new general manager, Randy Clark, still has a lot to deal with if Washingtonians hope to have a public transit system that works.
Speaking of Washingtonians’ hopes, D.C. voters turned out to vote in the city’s primary elections Tuesday. And while I’m disappointed that Bowser will be the Democratic nominee for mayor and likely win her third term in November, weaker turnout on her behalf is an encouraging sign that Washingtonians want real change, even if they think Bowser is still the best candidate to guide the city for now. Bowser’s support waned this cycle – she only won about 50 percent of the vote as of Thursday night, compared to 76 percent of votes in 2018. Bowser may have won this battle, but progressive candidates and their supporters have a good chance of winning the war in the future if Bowser continues to fail her constituents.
Thumbs Down: 
The University announced routine asymptomatic COVID-19 testing will become optional for students, staff and faculty beginning July 1 in an email Tuesday. Weekly tests have diminished during summer classes, but that doesn’t mean the University should have limited its ability to monitor community spread, especially as we look to a full return to campus this fall. While the positivity rate of 2.76 percent between June 14 and June 22 may be a notable drop from the nearly 5 percent rate at GW in May, it’s still above the 2 percent threshold officials used when reinstating the University’s mask mandate in April. That mask mandate is still in place, but will this policy lead to another embarrassing flip-flop? The University has used case positivity to guide its decisions – reducing the scope of or muddying that data now would be a mistake.
And while Riley discussed gun violence in D.C. last week, I’m sad to report that since then, a 15-year-old boy was killed and three adults were shot last Sunday night at the Moechella street festival at the corner of 14th and U streets NW. The day before, a shooting occurred between two groups at a Tysons Corner, Virginia shopping mall, though no one was injured. As Congress comes closer to finally acting on gun violence, I want to once again underscore that our leaders should pay attention to these shootings as much as they do mass tragedies – every victim of gun violence deserves a voice.

The rainbow hued limited edition cocktail, unveiled at the end of May, pays homage to “LGBTQ+ and Latinx icon” Walter Mercado and proceeds from its sales are donated to Casa Ruby – a community center for LGBTQ+ youth in D.C.
Celebrate Pride this month at El Tamarindo in Adams Morgan with a specialty cocktail generating proceeds for local LGBTQ+ youth and an extensive menu of Mexican and Salvadoran cuisine.
This casual Central American joint is located at the bottom of Adams Morgan’s lively 18th Street corridor at 1785 Florida Ave. NW and has been a landmark of the neighborhood for decades. Open until 2 a.m. on the weekends, El Tamarindo is a convenient spot to grab a late-night snack after clubbing in the area, and its large outdoor patio is ideal for spending the afternoon drinking and chowing down with friends.
In addition to its covered patio, the restaurant has two dining areas and a bar inside where the walls are filled with a hodgepodge of hung paintings and photos, depicting Latino icons, that give the space a homey vibe. Other than the artwork, and strings of colorful hanging country flags, the aesthetic is nothing special – everything inside from the floors and tables to the walls are a shade of brown.
Luckily, it’s the food and drinks that have earned El Tamarindo accolades like one of Washingtonian Magazine’s 50 most influential D.C. restaurants of the last century and Washington City Paper’s best Salvadoran restaurant in 2021.
Whether you’re barely hungry and just want to nibble or are ready to scarf down a full meal, El Tamarindo’s menu can accommodate you.
For a snack, try out one of the nine pupusas – a thick corn tortilla stuffed with ingredients, like chorizo and jalapeno for $3.65 each. The sweet corn ($3.75) or chicken ($3.50) tamales and the beef empanadas ($8.75 for two) are also ideal options if you’re in an appetizer mood.
For larger portions, look to the El Tamarindo Specials section of the menu featuring dishes like burritos (starting at $17.50), fajitas (starting at $17.50) and soft tacos (starting at $17.25). If you’re in the mood for seafood, check out the mariscos portion of the menu featuring a whole fried catch of the day ($23.99).
While the food was tempting, I stopped in specifically to try El Tamarindo’s specialty Pride Month themed cocktail called the Mucho Mucho Amor ($12). The rainbow hued limited edition cocktail, unveiled at the end of May, pays homage to “LGBTQ+ and Latinx icon” Walter Mercado, a well known Puerto Rican TV personality and astrologer, and proceeds from its sales are donated to Casa Ruby – a community center for LGBTQ+ youth in D.C, according to a Facebook post by the restaurant.
The drink is layered with a red base of cherry puree, a swirl of bright orange mango puree mixed with Don Q rum and a beautiful ocean-like layer of Blue Curacao. It’s served in a tall cylindrical glass to show off the colorful mixture of flavor, given a rim of tiny rainbow sprinkles and garnished with an orange slice, maraschino cherry and a small pride flag.
As someone who isn’t a huge fan of the taste of liquor, this drink was ideal – the sweetness and tanginess from the mango and cherry purees were the predominant flavor of the cocktail. The cold purees also gave the drink a slushy consistency, similar to a frozen cocktail that had me fantasizing of drinking it on a beach. And the combination of white rum and Blue Curacao made for a smooth but strong kick.
If you don’t like your drinks too sweet, try out the El #1 ($10) with Don Q rum, mint, lime, tamarindo juice and soda or the #BuildItOnTheNationalMall Michelada ($9.50), a Modelo Especial or Negra Modelo beer cocktail with a spicy Tamarindo-Tajin rim.
Whatever the occasion, time of day or hunger level, you’ll leave El Tamrindo satisfied and excited for your next visit.

Mayor Muriel Bowser will likely be the first three-term D.C. mayor since Marion Berry, who won his third term in 1986.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser won the D.C. Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night, setting her on the path to becoming the District’s first three-term mayor since 1986.
Progressive Councilmember Robert White challenged Bowser for the mayorship, but the Associated Press called the race in favor of the incumbent at about 9 p.m. Tuesday, with Bowser receiving 51.4 percent of the vote when the race was called. Bowser is likely to win the general election, which Democrats have never lost since the position’s creation in 1975, and said she plans to continue to help D.C. recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and tackle wealth inequality in the District.
“We have to really know how we’re going to bring our downtown back, how we’re going to fill spaces, how we’re going to change spaces, how we’re going to bring more people toward downtown and get our business economy going again and working with our federal partners to do exactly that,” Bowser said in a forum at GW last month.
Progressive Councilmember Trayon White and former lawyer James Butler also challenged Bowser, but each received less than 10 percent of the vote as of 9:30 p.m. Tuesday night.
Bowser, who heavily leaned on her eight years of experience during her campaign, has seen strong approval ratings throughout her two terms, but has also received criticism for not properly responding to rising house prices and instances of gentrification in the District. Other key moments of Bowser’s second term include the pandemic, demonstrations against police brutality and racism after the murder of George Floyd and the Capitol insurrection.
Ward 2, which encompasses GW’s campus, voted for Bowser by 33 percent with approximately 62 percent of votes counted. In February, Bowser said she was looking forward to working with interim University President Mark Wrighton, who she met earlier that month, on GW’s relationship with the District.
“I had the opportunity to meet with him virtually and in person today for the first time in person,” Bowser said in February. “He clearly understands GW’s huge role in the District, and I look forward to getting to know him and his vision for the University a little bit more.”

The medical trailer that held COVID-19 testing for the past year will cease operations next week, according to an email sent to the GW community.
The University will end its asymptomatic COVID-19 testing requirement starting in July, according to an email sent to the University community Tuesday.
The unsigned email states testing for asymptomatic community members will still be available for community members who need or want a test, and that symptomatic testing will stay in the University Student Center.
The email states the indoor mask requirement remains in place as on-campus COVID-19 cases continue to be elevated.
Testing centers for asymptomatic community members on Foggy Bottom Campus will now be at 1957 E Street, Monroe Hall and the Science and Engineering Hall starting July 5, according to the email. The email said the medical trailer will cease operations at noon on June 30 and that campus access will no longer be tied to COVID-19 testing compliance.
The University’s positivity rate is currently about 2.7 percent from June 9 to June 21 according to the COVID-19 dashboard. The dashboard shows 147 positive cases out of 4,508 tests taken in the two-week period with a high of 28 positive cases recorded on June 9.
The email states vaccinations would continue to be required for all students, faculty and staff for the fall semester and additional information about return-to-campus protocols will be released later in the summer.

The hotel served as a residence hall for nearly 300 undergraduates last year as Thurston Hall underwent renovations.
University officials last week sold the One Washington Circle Hotel property to a Florida-based real estate firm, which will renovate and reopen the building as a luxury hotel next year.
Real estate firm Electra America and hospitality company AKA jointly purchased the 152-room hotel, which served as a residence hall for undergraduates for the past academic year. The property will undergo a $30 million renovation and reopen to guests in June 2023 as a rebranded luxury AKA hotel, according to a University release. 
GW owned the One Washington Hotel as an investment property, and the property was formerly run by Modus Hotels before the recent sale to Electra America Hospitality Group.
The University converted the Washington Circle hotel into a temporary residence hall in September 2021 after renovations to Thurston Hall limited access to available beds for on-campus students. One Washington Circle suspended all reservations from the general public to stay at the hotel during the academic year and housed 282 juniors and seniors in the hotel.
Bruno Fernandes, GW’s treasurer and vice president of finance, said the sale of the property would fund other GW endeavors in the future.
“We are pleased by the successful completion of this transaction,” Bruno Fernandes said in the release. “The proceeds from the sale of One Washington Circle will be used to support the academic mission of the University.”
The University barred students from accessing balconies during their stay due to a 2019 agreement with the D.C. Zoning Commission to prevent noise complaints and avoid students throwing objects off their balconies. The University also closed off access to the pool at the request of the hotel, according to a 2019 hearing before the Zoning Commission. 
University officials began searching to sell or lease One Washington Hotel to a developer last December as students entered their second semester in the temporary residence hall.
