Ron Barron said officials will study how nondrivers travel through the Foggy Bottom Historic District and the Georgetown Waterfront area to recommend changes in neighborhood freeway and transportation layouts by fall 2023.
D.C. officials will study travel patterns in Foggy Bottom this spring to consider better connecting Foggy Bottom to the Georgetown Waterfront and Rock Creek Park through improved traffic infrastructure.
Ron Barron, a community planner for the D.C. Office of Planning, said the study will work to decide whether city planners can create new pedestrian and cyclist access between Foggy Bottom, the Georgetown Waterfront and Rock Creek Park to get around the Potomac River freeway network, which slices through the neighborhoods. Barron said officials will study how nondrivers travel through the Foggy Bottom Historic District and the Georgetown Waterfront area to recommend changes in neighborhood freeway and transportation layouts by fall 2023. 
Barron said the data will compile pedestrians’ transit experiences along Foggy Bottom corridors with heavy vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian traffic – like G Street and Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire avenues – through man-on-the-street polling this spring.
But members of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission said the study’s focus on pedestrian movement overlooks vehicular traffic patterns in the area. They said they were “confused” about the timing of the study, coming after District Department of Transportation officials installed protected bike lanes on Virginia Avenue last year to connect Rock Creek Park to the National Mall.
Barron said Foggy Bottom is a “good candidate” for nonvehicular observation because DDOT officials installed three sets of protected bike lanes in Foggy Bottom within the last two years. DDOT implemented a bike lane along G Street in Foggy Bottom in 2020, added another lane running through 20th and 21st streets in 2021 and installed the most recent set along Virginia Avenue from Rock Creek Trail to Constitution Avenue last year.
“There’s been a lot of work there, so we think this is a good opportunity for us to collect some very good data on how, with all the improvements, are people experiencing the connections that exist,” Baron said.
Barron said the connection between the Foggy Bottom Historic District, which includes most of the northeast corner of the neighborhood, has been a “massive” area of constituent concern for years. Local leaders said the Potomac River Freeway – an east-west leg of Interstate 66 crossing between D.C. and Virginia – forms a dividing line of traffic between the District and Georgetown and stifles uninterrupted, nonvehicle access between the areas.
The Office of Planning’s Comprehensive Plan, a guide for long-term urban planning in D.C., recommended a neighborhood study last year to investigate the “feasibility” of reconfiguring highways in Foggy Bottom and improving nonvehicular connections to Georgetown.
The freeway cuts underneath Virginia Avenue and includes an interchange with the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway and two ramps leading to either Georgetown via the Whitehurst Freeway or L Street. Barron said Foggy Bottom pedestrians and cyclists had “more access” to Rock Creek Park before the freeway’s installation in 1961, which displaced more than 270 families during the road demolition process.
He said the Office of Planning’s study will weigh various options to revive this pedestrian connection, like adding a “linear park” – a skinny stretch of green space – to the Whitehurst Freeway, removing I-66 entirely, installing a pedestrian bridge or “capping it over” with a deck bridge built on top of the roadway, which are commonly used to house new parks or buildings in urban areas.
“We’re specifically looking at the connections between the residential areas and the amenities,” Barron said.
He said there has been a gap in collected data on nonvehicular Foggy Bottom traffic since DDOT officials surveyed pedestrians and formed a master plan in 2009, where constituents recommended expanding bike lanes, pedestrian safety programs and upkeep of crosswalks in Foggy Bottom.
Barron said the Office of Planning consulted with DDOT to find out what the department has already studied in the area after the department installed the Virginia Avenue bike lane last year. DDOT conducts Traffic Safety Investigations using constituent-submitted service requests and collects traffic safety data about crashes, fatalities and injuries as part of Mayor Muriel Bowser’s Vision Zero program to eliminate traffic deaths.
Barron said if constituents feel that restricting the study to nonvehicular statistics is a “tremendous mistake,” DDOT will incorporate vehicle traffic data along certain corridors as deliberations over the survey’s scope continue.
“We are continuing to work with them as this project progresses,” Barron said.
Barron said he doesn’t know why DDOT installed the Virginia Avenue bike lane without the Office of Planning’s study beforehand. He said DDOT and Vision Zero studies have usually been vehicle and safety-focused instead of emphasizing residents’ transit experiences.
“That isn’t to say that DDOT is not doing outreach, that they’re putting in bike lanes without doing any kinds of studies,” Barron said. “I don’t know if they’re specifically doing this type of study, but there’s a process for planning that every department has to follow, and that includes collecting data, doing public outreach.” 
DDOT did not return multiple requests for comment.
ANC commissioners suggested the Office of Planning include data about vehicle traffic in the study to ensure the study reflects all modes of transportation throughout Foggy Bottom. Others said the department should have conducted the study before installing a protected bike lane on Virginia Avenue last year, which presents safety issues for pedestrians with mobility impairments. 
Commissioner Donna Barbisch – who represents the Southeast side of Foggy Bottom, which includes Virginia Avenue – welcomes the Office of Planning’s study but said officials should also interpret vehicle data because cars are a major component of transit along Foggy Bottom corridors.
“Roads are part of our infrastructure,” Barbisch said. “If you don’t start with them, then you’ve got to work around them.”
During November’s ANC meeting, constituents and commissioners questioned why DDOT officials installed protected bike lanes along Virginia Avenue last year without a previous Office of Planning survey investigating pedestrian needs on the road. Some said the city’s removal of a pedestrian refuge island on the Virginia and New Hampshire avenue intersection created crosswalk safety concerns for pedestrians with mobility restrictions like some senior citizens who may not be able to cross the street in the time the crossing signal allots.
“I’m a little confused by this,” Dina Fox, a constituent at last month’s ANC meeting said. “How is it possible to start such a study after you’ve already put in the bike lane? Isn’t that the sort of thing that should have preceded the bike lane?”
Joel Causey, the chair of the ANC, said the DDOT “fumbled” the Virginia Avenue bike lane process by skipping a constituent vetting period and sacrificing the street’s “safe haven” stopgap as a result. He said the pedestrian safety issues stemming from the island’s removal could’ve been avoided if D.C. had conducted an Office of Planning study before the lanes’ installation.
“The end result is, I don’t think we have a bike lane system that serves the people correctly and is entirely safe for everybody,” Causey said.

GW Athletics will distribute “additional funding” from alumna Annemargaret Connolly – a member of the department's Advisory Council – and her husband Ken Frank across its programs, according to a release issued Tuesday.

The athletic department raised more than $200,000 as part of this year’s annual Athletics Buff and Blue Fund Challenge – a downtick from its previous haul of $350,000 in 2021.
More than 1,100 donors – half of whom were alumni student-athletes – participated in the challenge, according to a release issued Tuesday. Gymnastics raised the most money in the fundraiser, and baseball boasted the most donors of any program.
Water polo maintained the highest alumni-athlete giving percentage, a category in which volleyball was the most improved from last year. Last year, baseball and water polo earned the most funding of any athletic program, receiving $7,000 each through the challenge.
“I am so inspired by the results of this year’s Challenge, especially the big jump in alumni-athlete giving,” GW Athletics Director Tanya Vogel said in the release. “It’s a tremendous example of what teamwork can accomplish and gives me great hope for the future of all of our athletic programs. I am so grateful for everyone who gave to GW Athletics.”
The release states GW Athletics will distribute “additional funding” from alumna Annemargaret Connolly – a member of the department’s Advisory Council – and her husband Ken Frank across its programs. 
“Ken and I are thrilled about the success we had in this year’s Buff & Blue Fund Challenge, especially the large number of gifts we received from our alumni,” Connolly said in the press release. “I was honored to be a part of engaging our Athletics Community and to see the amazing results we were able to achieve together. Raise High!”

When I think of Marilyn Monroe, I think of my poem “Having Everything Concealed,” which I wrote a year ago. “you don’t deserve all of me,” it begins, “the joy i sing unsung / the pain i strum unheard / i reserve my majesty for myself.” Even though the poem was inspired by Rhythm & Blues singer H.E.R., an acronym that stands for “Having Everything Revealed,” it certainly connects to the secrecy that still surrounds the actress’ personal life.
There have been numerous attempts to excavate the authentic Marilyn Monroe, continuing today with Netflix’s Blonde and the streaming giant’s documentary The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes. But our decades-long obsession with the star has only yielded one revelation: we will never know the “real” Marilyn Monroe. No matter how many times we try to solve the mystery of who she was offscreen or claim a connection to her story, the full truth of the actress’ life does not belong to us. We should relinquish our noxious sense of entitlement to her private life and let the legend rest in peace.
My own fascination with Marilyn Monroe dates back to middle school, when I tried to achieve a kind of cultural sophistication by reading classic literature and watching Golden Age Hollywood films. Included on my list of movies to watch was the Monroe-starring Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Some Like It Hot. Seeing her onscreen, I was immediately enamored. To this day, Monroe wearing her famous blonde coiffure with a cinched magenta dress and radiant diamonds remains one of my favorite fashion visions.
After seeing her movies, I began voraciously reading the 2001 edition of Donald Spoto’s biography of the actress, identifying with her efforts at self-improvement. As I learned from the 2012 documentary, Love Marilyn, she achieved her famous gait by walking as if a string was attached to her head and the string itself was attached to a cloud. Soon, I practiced my own string-cloud strut, pointing my chin and raising my shoulders. Unsurprisingly, I reverted to my unremarkable saunter the next day. 
Nonetheless, I belted the lyrics to Nicki Minaj’s 2012 song named after the star. “Call it a curse, or just call me blessed / If you can’t handle my worst, you ain’t getting my best,” I sang, delighting in Minaj’s interpolation of one of Monroe’s most popular but most likely misattributed quotes. When the end of the chorus came, I mimicked Minaj’s theatrical insistence: “Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt? Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt.” The truth, which my pre-adolescent self failed to acknowledge, was that I did not know how Marilyn Monroe felt. I did not know her – and never would. 
Not knowing Monroe has not discouraged celebrities from souveniring their way to the actress’ selfhood. Before her appearance at the 2022 Met Gala, Kim Kardashian received a box containing a supposed lock of Monroe’s hair from attractions company Ripley’s Believe It or Not!. Ripley’s also lent Kardashian Monroe’s iconic sheer Jean Louis dress for the event. Monroe wore the flesh-toned gown when she famously sang a sultry “Happy Birthday” to President John F. Kennedy in 1962 at Madison Square Garden. 
Even without Monroe’s possessions, people still feel a physical closeness to the star and her complicated story of fame and misfortune. In an essay for Vogue, actress Lena Dunham connected herself to the “triumph and tragedy” of Monroe’s life through a book about (and ode to) Monroe, which Dunham received on her 33rd birthday. “‘For Lena—who, like Marilyn, has something for everybody.’ She is everywhere.” Dunham writes. “And despite being everywhere, with something for everyone, she had something just for me.”
These unhealthy efforts to own and uncover the woman behind the blonde bombshell image disturbed Monroe, the actress told writer Richard Meryman in their 1962 Life magazine interview. “It’s almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you’ll let the whole world in on only for a moment, when you’re acting,” she said of artists protecting their privacy. “But everybody is always tugging at you. They’d all like sort of a chunk of you.”
Unfortunately, the public continues to grasp at pieces of Monroe instead of acknowledging the toxicity of their obsession with her. Andy Warhol’s 1964 “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn,” depicting the actress against a blue backdrop sold at an auction for $195 million in May, making it the most expensive auctioned work by a U.S. artist. Netflix’s recently released Blonde, which stars Ana De Armas and is based on author Joyce Carol Oates’ fictionalization of the star, reduces Monroe to a tragic sex symbol. Despite the movie’s popularity on the platform, critics assailed the film for victimizing Monroe and denying her happier moments. 
Netflix’s The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes received similar criticism for peddling conspiracy theories related to the actress’s tragic death. These slew of projects reveals not only our shameful fixation with an immortalized icon but also our frustration with a luminary still so out of reach despite her lore that has been circulated for several years. 
Now that I am older with a more empathetic appreciation for Monroe, I can recognize how my earlier obsession contributed to the larger preoccupation with her life. I also realize what I most admire about Monroe more than anything else. Sure, the writer in me rejoices in the fact that she wrote poetry and owned more than 400 books in her lifetime. And of course, I respect how she started her own production company and advocated for jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald. 
But what amazes me most of all is how fiercely she guarded her interiority. Despite her story that has been dissected for decades, Monroe still retains the mystery that we were never entitled to solve in the first place. Her private life is still rightfully impenetrable to us, and I am glad that it will remain this way. Perhaps, the impossibility of knowing who Monroe was in private will encourage other people to critique their obsession with a woman who only signed up to act and not to live on in the cruel immortality of fictionalization and objectification.
We may have her glittered gowns and gilded filmography. But we will never have all of her. Ultimately, Monroe reserved her full majesty and human complexity for herself.

Wiley announced in a release that it will restore access to 1,380 e-books from the ProQuest Academic Complete collection "as soon as possible" after removing the titles in August.
Wiley will restore students’ access to more than 1,000 free e-books after the publishing company removed the titles from the Gelman Library’s open-access materials in August.
The company will restore access to 1,380 e-books from the ProQuest Academic Complete collection “as soon as possible” after removing the titles in August, according to a release issued Wednesday. The release states the e-books, which at least 300 students used as course materials, will be in the collection until June 2023, but the e-books will not be available after the extension date.
Wiley spokesperson Matt Leavy said in June 2020 the publishing company gave ProQuest a two-year advance notice of the removal of 1,380 e-books from the Academic Complete collection to ensure appropriate time for subscribers to accommodate for the lost materials, but customers were “caught off guard” by the titles’ removal.
“We sincerely apologize for any disruption this may have caused students, instructors and libraries,” Leavy said in the release. “We are reviewing the process of updating collections to avoid similar situations in the future.”
Officials said the removal of older titles from the Academic Complete collection is routine, but Wiley did not provide GW Libraries alternative options to purchase the removed titles for students.
Faculty who used the e-books as course materials said they reorganized their syllabus and ordered physical copies of older editions of the e-book they used to accommodate for the removal.

For about the last 20 minutes, Jones went out into the audience on the floor to give light-hearted roasts to anyone the microphone wire would let her reach as a designated part of her set.
Even on Alumni and Families Weekend, parents and families should do their research to ensure they will be comfortable with a comedian’s humor.
Actress and comedian Leslie Jones brought her raunchy and sexual jokes to the District as the featured star in this year’s Fall Comedy Show, but received mixed reactions from attendees due to the explicit nature of her controversial set. New York stand-up comedian Lenny Marcus preceded the former Saturday Night Live cast member’s performance at the annual show that has traditionally attracted past SNL stars, including Michael Che and Mikey Day.
The Memphis-born comedian Jones started her career performing at stand-up venues in the Los Angeles area. Since then, she is most known for her roles on SNL and the 2016 reboot of Ghostbusters. Jones and Marcus launched a podcast in August called “The fckry with Leslie Jones and Lenny Marcus,” where the comedians rant about everything from dating and sex to societal issues.
Getting inside the arena Saturday night felt like its own accomplishment with lines of people wrapped for blocks around the various entrances as the clock neared 9 p.m., when Marcus was scheduled to begin.
Marcus poked fun at a range of controversies at GW and across the country during his standup performance, from the Colonials moniker to the need for a gun in the United States, but some comments didn’t have everyone laughing. Marcus’ joke that he shouldn’t own a gun because he would “kill about half of the Supreme Court” in response to the overturn of Roe v. Wade caused some mixed reactions from the crowd.
After Marcus’ set wrapped up around the 30-minute mark, the Emmy-nominated actress appeared on stage with a colorful shirt with the name of political activist Angela Davis in orange letters below a portrait of the activist and her legendary afro during her young adulthood.
Jones’ comedic style was far more explicit than Marcus’ – at least one third of Jones’ segment centered around the sexual mistakes of her past, how to sexually please women and sex advice for college students. Jones made graphic sexual jokes like comparing “the softness of d*ck skin” to crepes and suggesting that men should use the hand motions they use while playing video games to “pleasure pu*sy.”
Jones even pointed out particular audience members, giving them sexual advice like “This is college, okay. Start sucking some d*ck,” in response to a group of girls in the audience saying they did not have boyfriends.
Jones offered a few tidbits of nonsexual, general life advice like “You’re going to f*ck up a lot. You’re supposed to.” Her set at times felt like a mini sermon.
Jones addressed the common belief that she is a lesbian, saying she would “get so many b*tches” if she was. “I’d have them b*tches fighting outside my house,” she said.
For about the last 20 minutes, Jones descended to the floor of the Smith Center with the audience to give light-hearted roasts to anyone the microphone wire would let her reach, though the comments were not always appreciated by their recipients. She even poked fun at the parents in the front row who brought their children to this clearly adult-rated show, exclaiming “He’s 12!” Laughter filled the arena, causing Jones to break at times, laughing at her own jokes.
“When your kid grows up, and he’s f*cked up, he can blame it on you for bringing him to Leslie Jones,” she said.
As the clock neared 11 p.m., the laughs and cheers came to a close as the two comedians concluded their show while audience members ruminated on the performance they had witnessed.
“I didn’t think it was anything out of the ordinary from what she normally does,” GW parent David Kingston said of Jones’ explicit style of comedy.
Even audience members that enjoyed the show were shocked by some of the raunchy and explicit details in Jones’ performance.
“I had no idea what to expect, and I was surprised,” Kingston’s wife, Kristi Kingston, said.
The parents – visiting their daughter, a senior – were less disgruntled by the performance than other visitors with younger students.
One mother in the front row appeared visibly upset when Jones called her a “MILF” and insinuated that her son’s friends were attracted to her.
“I was really upset that GW put us in this situation,” the parent wrote on the George Washington University Parents Underground Group on Facebook with nearly 3,000 members. “We were expecting the content to be something we could enjoy.”
“It was awful,” the parent wrote. “45 minutes of graphic and raunchy sexual content sitting next to my 18-year-old son. I wanted to leave but we were in the front row and the only exit path would have required us to walk right past her.”
While some of Jones’ and Marcus’ jokes may not have pleased everyone, no real comedic performance will, nor should it. Comedy is meant to make certain audience members uncomfortable, within reason, and Jones’ performance at GW was no exception to her usual comedic style. This year’s fall comedy show set the tone for this weekend as one that will be filled with laughter albeit controversy in the nation’s capital.

The conversation began with Yovanovitch discussing the benefits of being an introvert within her field, which relies on listening deeply to others.
The former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine spoke to guests in the Elliott School of International Affairs on Monday.
Retired U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch spoke to guests about her time in public service, the challenges she faced and the current war in Ukraine. The event was hosted by the Leadership Ethics and Practice Initiative at the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasia Studies in collaboration with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace moderated by Sara Huzar, a first-year graduate student studying Europe and Eurasia.
The conversation began with Yovanovitch discussing the benefits of being an introvert within her field, which relies on listening deeply to others.
“One of the most important things in diplomacy is communication and really understanding where the other side is coming from,” Yovanovitch said.
Her introverted tendencies helped within her career, as at events with larger gatherings she strategically chose only a few people to talk to in order to further her diplomatic agenda, Yovanovitch said. Yovanovitch also spoke on the role of self-doubt during her ambassadorships while trying to advance her goals.
“I realized two to three tours in that I was not going to like my first seven or eight months at the embassy because I always felt like I was the most stupid person in the room because I didn’t know any of the answers,” Yovanovitch said.
During this time, however, Yovanovitch said she drew on her work ethic and commitment.
“I just don’t think there’s any question, at least in my view, that hard work and discipline can get you where you need to go,” Yovanovitch said.
Cutting past the self-doubt, Yovanovitch pointed out the challenges often presented to her and other colleagues about accommodating both narrow and larger interests among countries.
“There are overarching goals, but there are also sometimes very narrow goals for particular agencies,” Yovanovitch said. “So how do you bring everyone together to work on the big goals and to support people on some of the more narrow goals?”
Following the conversation between Huzar and Yovanovitch, the conversation shifted to questions from the audience, many of which focused on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
“The bottom line is we just need to stand our ground,” Yovanovitch. “The Ukrainians have no choice.”
Yovanovitch believes the Biden Administration is doing a “pretty good job,” surpassing her own expectations.
Lydia Miller, a sophomore in the Elliott School of International Affairs who stated she was born in Kyiv, Ukraine, asked Yovanovitch about refugees only being granted a limited visa within the United States. Yovanovitch said the United States should focus on allowing Ukrainian citizens to one day return to Ukraine since many want to go home.
“They want to go home,” Yovanovitch said. “If we can create those conditions, that would be best.”

If my 15-year-old self ever found out I wasn’t majoring in political science, she would be up in arms. I was your classic debate-loving politics nerd in high school, known for skipping school to attend climate strikes and post snarky tweets about the presidential primary before I could even vote. GW was on my radar for all four years, mainly because I knew it was one of the best places to get an internship on Capitol Hill, set myself up for law school and run for office by 30 – the typical career path in the District, and a way to make my family proud. But now that I’m here 2,000 miles from home, I’m planning on majoring in American studies, with no strong convictions about what sort of career I want. And while my younger self might be disappointed, I couldn’t be happier.
I tell this story to anyone who will listen because I got lucky and saved myself from the misery that is being trapped in a major you’re not meant to pursue. Despite the competitive and overly political environment at GW, I stuck with American studies because I truly love it. I want to spend college exploring more than just clear-cut politics – I’m interested in analyzing American literature and film, examining philosophies, critiquing culture and combining more creative forms of academia with my passion for social justice. Facing one of the most important decisions of my life, to pick a career path at such a young age has been daunting. It’s hard not to wonder if I’m making the wrong choice, but I know that doubt is external and has nothing to do with my actual academic interests. Still, it takes a conscious effort not to succumb to second-guessing about what the “right” major is. Students travel from all over the world and pay thousands of dollars to study at GW for a few years. To savor their experience and save themselves from insecure regret during this short timeframe, they should choose to follow their passions and disregard societal pressures.
Because of the glowing opportunity to engage directly in national politics in D.C., political science and international affairs have become the dominant majors that attract a majority of students and underscore the academic culture at GW. As a student who doesn’t belong to one of these more popular majors, I can’t help but feel out of place and insecure studying in this city with plans that steer away from Capitol Hill. STEM majors face similar judgment as a field of study that doesn’t gel with its surroundings as easily. Liberal arts majors, like philosophy or film studies, also receive constant flack for not majoring in something more “practical.” When I introduce myself with my major, I’m often met with a blank stare and awkward pause, or simply, “I’ve never heard of American Studies. What kind of career can you get with that?” I even catch myself desperately pointing out similarities between my major and political science as if its proximity to a more popular major is the only source of its value. In reality, I chose my major for its own merits, even if they are less obvious to the average person. In what other department can you get credit toward your major for a course called Zombie Capitalism? Passion for a subject, even if other people haven’t heard of it, is nothing to be ashamed of.
Political science and international affairs have become so prevalent on campus that they have created a sense of imposter syndrome for those who study as part of the majority. What might have felt like a niche interest back home has created an ocean of students with the exact same passion at GW. The more popular the major here, the more likely it is to be seen as “basic.” We’ve all heard jokes about the stereotypical characterizations of “Elliott kids” who wears a suit to class, the cookie-cutter “Hillterns” who study political science and the replacement of college football with Mock Trial or Model United Nations. The tendency of students to cling to their major and potential career for a sense of identity speaks to the harmful American culture we’re adopting that associates work and social contribution with individual value. Adhering to the stereotype can make you feel invisible while fighting it makes you feel like an outsider. The art of justifying your major to others is universal, whether hundreds of students – or just a dozen – are studying it.
Fields of study should not be to blame for the insecurity that students experience. The overwhelming pressure to succeed and make a life-changing decision about what to study at such a young age creates an emotional experience, capable of derailing one’s mental health or self-esteem. Young adults don’t need to know right away what to do with the rest of their lives. Everyone is simply trying to survive in a pool of thousands of other students who do not quite understand themselves either – I know I am. Studying at GW is a privilege and an incredible opportunity, so to allow insecurity into my studies would be a travesty and a waste.
My major isn’t the most important thing about me – it’s a tool that I can use to explore my interests and make a life for myself. Students should explore what they honestly love and be proud of it. When responding to the typical ice breaker that asks for my name, pronouns, hometown and major, I embrace the opportunity to share my field of study with others, even if it might require further explanation. It takes courage and effort to stick to your convictions, especially when it seems like you’re on a different path than everyone else, but it’s worth it. Finding your place in the world is extraordinarily difficult, and everyone deserves a space that embraces them for who they are and what they love.

Despite a number of service errors and an inability to hold leads in the first and second sets, the Colonials managed to reignite their offense and deliver well-placed strikes to retake the match.
Volleyball took down George Mason in a comeback victory after losing the first two sets, striking a 3–2 final score.
The Colonials (9-9) dropped the first two sets narrowly against the Patriots (5-11) but managed to build solid leads in the third and fourth sets before taking the match in the fifth. The Colonials picked up their third straight win after beating Duquesne on the road twice last Friday.
The Patriots got off to a quick start offensively, notching three straight points after serving to start. GW returned fire, going on a 4–2 run to make it 7–5, off of two kills by sophomore outside hitter Brittany Myers. Myers would go on to lead the Colonials with 19 kills on the night.
The set remained tight throughout, with GW taking the largest lead at four midway through. Sophomore opposite MC Daubendiek and graduate middle blocker Tierra Porter stuffed a Patriot spike at the net to take a 19–15 lead.
George Mason responded with a 10–3 run to take the set 22–25. The Colonials struggled to limit their service errors throughout the match, often sending them long and tallying four in just the first set.
After GW dropped the first set, the second proved to be the closest of the match, featuring multiple lead changes. After the Colonials pulled ahead with a 7–5 lead off a serve from freshman libero Penelope Hiepler, the set difference would stay within one until the final point.
With the second set tied at 22, GW sent a serve way long to put them at a one-point disadvantage. Sophomore outside hitter Salem Yohannes notched a well-placed kill to tie it back up.
George Mason scored off a classic bump, set and spike before winning the final point off the serve to take set 2.
The third set was a different story as the Colonials took a commanding lead early, at one point leading 20–9, coming off an 8–0 run. Yohannes led the final part of the surge, scoring three straight aces.
But the Patriots wouldn’t give up easily, mounting an improbable 14–4 comeback run that threatened to seal the match and brought the score to within one. GW managed to hold on after a long volley, keeping their chances alive and capturing the set 25–23.
The Colonials took full control in the fourth set, capitalizing on their momentum from the third set lead. GW would build a sizable lead, going up by as much as eight and outpacing the Patriots in hitting .292 percent to .143 percent.
After setting the score at 19–11, the lead shrank and George Mason pulled within just four at 24-20. Junior opposite Liv Womble sealed the fourth set for GW, going off the pace with a well-placed tap to nab the final point.
In the fifth and final set, GW dropped the first two points after a pair of kills by Patriot sophomore right side Olyvia Kennedy, who led the match in kills with 20. The Colonials then went on a 7–3 push, punctuated by a dramatic blog at the net from senior middle blocker Addie Feek to make it 7–5.
From here, the lead stayed within one point until a strike from Porter evened the match at 13. Freshman libero Amina Robinson served for GW and fired an ace to set up a match point. The Colonials led big in aces on the day, scoring 12 to George Mason’s five.
After a net violation by the Patriots on the final point, GW took set 5 and the match, despite dropping sets 1 and 2.
Despite a number of service errors and an inability to hold leads in the first and second sets, the Colonials managed to reignite their offense and deliver well-placed strikes to retake the match.
GW will take on Saint Louis on Friday, Oct. 7 at 6 p.m. at the Smith Center.

I opted for the Element Roll ($16), featuring rice, avocado and yellowtail with Kabayaki sauce and a spicy serrano pepper on top
Perry’s is on a roll – the rooftop sushi restaurant has been an Adams Morgan staple since its opening in 1984 and remains a hotspot destination, providing stunning views along with tasty Japanese cuisine in a historic area of Northwest D.C.
Founded by Saied Azali, Perry’s became notable for its pioneering approach to Asian fusion and has since become a quintessential Adams Morgan institution, thanks in part to the often sold-out weekly drag brunches and hip rooftop scene. The menu offers an array of Japanese cuisine to choose from as well as an option to have a sushi or sashimi meal curated by the chef, but choosing a few of the rolls from the sushi menu to share with the table is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.
Perry’s popularity comes with a drawback – with constant bustling crowds, it can be difficult to get a reservation on weekends. But on a rainy Tuesday night, the place is fairly quiet, a welcome change from the normal hustle and bustle.
At first glance, Perry’s seems fairly nondescript. It shares the building with another restaurant owned by Azali called The Mintwood Palace, and patrons need to walk up a steep flight of stairs to even reach the main dining area. But after making the climb, the space is a treat.
Stylish, ornate wallpaper matches the chair and booths behind a long, elegant bar which takes up an entire wall. Large, curved windows framed by dark curtains overlook the street, adding to the ambiance of the rainy evening to create a lovely and calming atmosphere for a meal. While the room is expansive, the lower lighting gives it a cozy feel.
After being seated promptly, the server welcomed us with an extensive menu. Perry’s offers soups, salads, sushi and nonsushi appetizers, as well as a long list of larger entrees. For a substantial meal with a wide variety of components, order the Bento Box with rice, pickled vegetables and your choice of shrimp, chicken or pork as well as the option to add sushi ($17). For a real adventure, order the Omakase chef-curated meal, or choose a large platter with a spread of options like the Sashimi Deluxe ($33) or the Salmon Lover ($25).
We kept it simple and ordered from the Sushi A La Carte menu which has traditional sushi rolls called Ura Maki for eight pieces per order. Pricier options include the Spider roll ($19), with crab, avocado, tempura flakes and spicy mango, and the sushi menu also offers more affordable alternatives like the California Roll ($8).
I opted for the Element Roll ($16), featuring rice, avocado and yellowtail. This standout roll is topped with a Kabayaki sauce, which adds a subtle sweetness, complemented by a spicy serrano pepper on top. Each roll was aesthetically pleasing, wrapped tight and precisely garnished with the pepper adding a green pop of color. The rolls were topped with tempura flakes that added a crunchy texture to each bite, contrasting with the delicate-tasting yellowtail.
Perry’s menu is best shared, so we ordered the Spicy Crunchy Salmon Roll ($10), which provided a nice change from the milder Element Roll. To create a more complete spread, we also ordered the Pork Gyoza Dumpling appetizer ($9) to compliment the sushi rolls. The dumplings were a standout – warm and fried just the right amount. Both dishes were great additions to our shared meal and easily divided among two patrons.
Although the rainy night kept most of the guests inside, Perry’s also boasts a popular, lively rooftop bar. Patrons can head into a hallway at the back of the restaurant and up another set of steep stairs to find a large dining area with string lights swinging above and a birdseye views of the busy neighborhood and surrounding buildings below.
If you’re looking to avoid the outdoors in the District’s recent stormy conditions, a covered bar on the rooftop offers reprieve from the rain. There, I found a common sight at Perry’s – a small shielded party enjoying the dining experience, stormy night and all.
Perry’s has tasty sushi fare, but it’s the swanky yet inviting atmosphere that will keep you coming back for more.

The D.C. council made fare evasion a civil offense in the District in 2019, and any fare evaders caught in D.C. could pay up to $50 when fines begin to be handed out in November.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority will begin a campaign warning fare evaders of fines before beginning an aggressive ticketing campaign in November, officials announced in a release Tuesday.
WMATA began displaying digital warning signs in Metro stations Tuesday, urging riders to pay their fare and warning them that Metro Transit Police Officers could fine riders if they don’t pay. The digital warnings, which also depict how much each fine could cost evaders in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, will run for two weeks before MTPD officers and Metro workers begin handing out fliers to fare evaders with the same warnings, and in November, MTPD officers will begin handing out fines to anyone not paying their Metro fare.
“Metro has a message for fare evaders: operating buses and trains isn’t free,” the release states. “Customers riding Metrobus and Metrorail are required to pay fares and will be warned accordingly.”
The D.C. council made fare evasion a civil offense in 2019, and any fare evaders caught in the District could pay up to $50 when fines begin to be handed out in November. In Maryland and Virginia, where fare evasion is a criminal offense, fines handed out could cost evaders up to $100.
WMATA estimates that it lost $40 million in revenue to fare evasion in 2022, based on pre-pandemic Metrobus and Metrorail averages and think that a new “faregate technology,” which has been installed in various stations – including Foggy Bottom’s Metro station – will help them gather more accurate data on revenue lost to fare evasion, according to the release.
“The region needs to decide what we want Metro to be, and fare policy should be part of the conversation,” WMATA General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Randy Clarke said in the release. “Many people have mentioned going to a fare-free model, but fare-free does not mean free. There are costs associated with running the community’s transit system.”
