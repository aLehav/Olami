More than 28 percent of respondents said they were struggling to pay tuition amid the pandemic, and more than 96 percent of the respondents said they were “dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied” about not receiving a tuition reduction.
The Student Association’s Graduate Senators Caucus hosted a town hall Thursday to discuss graduate students’ sentiments regarding officials’ refusal to grant them a tuition reduction for the academic year.
SA Sen. Sebastian Weinmann, Law-G and the chair of the caucus, presented the findings of a survey administered earlier this month to graduate students concerning officials’ decision to provide a 10 percent tuition discount to undergraduates but not graduate students. Weinmann said the members of the caucus will submit to officials a report – based on the findings from the survey and testimonials from the town hall – demonstrating why the graduate student body should receive the same reduction allocated to the undergraduate body.
Weinmann said the graduate student tuition survey received 721 responses from all 10 of the University’s schools, making up roughly five percent of the graduate student body.
More than 28 percent of respondents said they were struggling to pay tuition amid the pandemic, and more than 96 percent of the respondents said they were “dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied” about not receiving a tuition reduction, the results state. More than 46 percent of survey participants said they are considering deferring or postponing their enrollment at GW, and more than 29 percent said they are considering transferring from GW to another university.
The survey also revealed that less than one-third of graduate student respondents were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the University’s response to COVID-19.
Weinmann said many respondents noted that since the pandemic began, they have lost access to several on-campus resources, including graduate schools’ buildings and libraries and the Lerner Health and Wellness Center. Prior to the start of the semester, officials restricted access to buildings on all three of GW’s campuses only to community members approved to be on campus.
“It’s really clear from these numbers that grad students do usually utilize a lot of the resources and services that the University offers on campus,” Weinmann said. “It’s not just undergrads using these spaces, and we are missing out because we are in a virtual semester.”
Weinmann said one of the sentiments most often brought up in the survey was that graduate students felt “undervalued” compared to undergraduates after not receiving a tuition reduction, and “many” said they felt the University was using them as a “cash cow.”
“The takeaway is that there really is a tremendous amount of hurt among students across all of GW’s graduate schools because of the University’s decisions regarding graduate tuition,” Weinmann said.
SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G and a member of the caucus, said survey respondents wrote they would use the money saved from the tuition reduction to pay for basic living expenses, like rent, groceries, paying off debt and saving for the future amid the current economic climate.
“It was just sad and very telling how easy it was to find these difficult experiences for students and really shows how this would be beneficial for students as well,” he said
Falcigno said caucus members intend to meet with officials and ask that administrators treat the undergraduate and graduate student bodies “equally” and recognize that graduate students are facing “significant” financial hardships. He said the lack of recognition administrators have given graduate students is “astounding.”
“There’s just such a lack of empathy from GW administrators toward graduate students that is frankly incredibly upsetting,” he said.

Sophomore Sydney McArthur, the co-founder of SINAR, said the organization had a “more inclusive” mission in collaborating with multiple organizations for Native American Heritage Month this year.
GW Students for Indigenous and Native American Rights is hosting online events throughout November to commemorate their annual Native American Heritage Celebration.
GW SINAR is collaborating with student organizations like GW Organization of Latin American Students, the Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service and community activists to celebrate November’s NAHC with five virtual events. Student leaders said they expanded their events this year to focus more on facilitating discussions with students in online formats like a podcast because the remote semester prevented in-person events like film screenings.
Sophomore Sydney McArthur, the co-founder of SINAR, said the organization had a “more inclusive” mission in collaborating with multiple organizations for Native American Heritage Month this year.
“We tried not to have a jam-packed month with events like we would have done maybe on campus because we understand that with midterms and finals coming up, not to mention the difficulties of being at home, we don’t want to overwhelm people, especially many of our students of color who might not have the same accessibilities,” McArthur said. “We don’t want to prohibit anyone from participating. So we want to make it as accessible and as reasonable as possible.”
She said the group collaborated with GW OLAS on Friday for an episode of OLAS’ “Colonial Chisme” podcast discussing the intersectionality of Indigenous heritage in Latin America.
She said the event was meant to broaden discussions on indigeneity and bring both multicultural groups’ history and cultures together. She said in previous years the group focused more on the representation of indigenous peoples in areas like cinema.
McArthur said group members collaborated over FaceTime and Google Docs to brainstorm events for the celebration and many organizations like GW Students Against Imperialism and GW Black Defiance supported SINAR’s advocacy by sharing social media posts on their own pages. McArthur said the group also hosted an event during GW’s 6th Annual Diversity Summit discussing “indignity and colonialism in the present” as part of their celebration.
Georgie Britcher, a junior and co-founder of SINAR, said student leaders decided to still organize their celebration this month despite the pandemic because it’s necessary to promote indigenous representation at GW where many students may not be as aware of issues affecting those communities. She said at a time when the Navajo Nation is experiencing an “uncontrolled spread” of COVID-19, educating people about Indigenous cultures is “incredibly” vital. 
She said it’s been “really nice” to see different student organizations want to collaborate on events or participate in the discussions SINAR has hosted this month. 
“The Navajo Nation has been experiencing the worst comeback of COVID-19,” Britcher said. “So this is not a time to forget about Indigenous people and not only just to educate people about Indigenous culture but also to show that we’re still here and to celebrate our existence as well.”

Mentors have offered insight into the application process for law school, pre-law students said.
Updated: Nov. 25, 2020 at 5:11 p.m.
GW Law students launched a mentorship program earlier this month to provide pre-law undergraduates with resources to study for the Law School Admission Test and advise them on their law school application essays.
Students involved with the program said current law school students and attorneys are paired with undergraduates to look over their law school applications and introduce them to other law students and admissions counselors. Undergraduate mentees said the program has helped them navigate their preparations to take the LSAT and apply to law school by giving them a personalized perspective on the application process.
Richard Samboy, a third-year law student and the vice president of student enrichment services for the Student Bar Association who helped organize the program, said almost 170 undergraduates have signed up for the mentorship program along with “close to” 100 law school students and attorneys to serve as mentors.
Samboy said he started developing the program over the summer after becoming the law school’s student engagement vice president and worked with Debbie Baker – GW’s sole pre-law adviser who was recently laid off – to reach out to current pre-law students and gauge interest for the program.
“Students are still expected to do the basic things that pre-law advisers do, which is review materials and then take it one step further and actually meet however many times they can all meet,” he said.
Students said last month that GW’s remaining pre-law advising services after Baker’s departure are “inadequate” but said the new mentorship program will provide more opportunities for pre-law students to receive guidance.
Samboy said when students are eventually allowed back on campus, he plans to introduce his mentees to other law students and law school admissions officers from GW. He said he also plans to connect them with attorneys during a “speed networking” event next semester and hold virtual admissions events in addition to guest speakers.
He said he hopes to make the process of applying to law school easier for the next generation of law students through the program. He said the decision to launch the program after Baker was let go was “perfect timing” and “filled a necessary void” as a new resource to guide students.
“Even though the pre-law adviser was let go, these students do have some sort of guidance, individualized guidance,” he said. “Hopefully, they’re not left to figure things out on their own.”
Samboy, who is also a mentor himself, said he assigned each student a mentor they have something in common with, like interests or life experiences, to give all students an “equal opportunity” to have a mentor.
Ignacio Gomez, a freshman majoring in international affairs who is one of Samboy’s mentees, said he signed up for the program to understand more about what law school had to offer for a potential career. He said he met with his mentor to ask about law school and the LSAT, and the two have gotten to know each other more personally.
“We’ve also gotten to know each other on a personal level so his background and my background and comparing how that might relate to a law profession,” he said.
He said the new mentorship program can’t fully compensate for the loss of Baker, but it will help him stay on track academically and understand the inner workings of the law school application process.
“I honestly wasn’t expecting to get a mentor,” Gomez said. “But hearing that all the freshmen and all the sophomores who applied, I’m pretty sure, got one, I think that’s honestly really great on their part for wanting to include everybody.”
Kylie Henry, a sophomore majoring in international affairs, said she decided to join the program because she didn’t know anyone with experience applying to law school and was looking for additional resources. She said through the program, she hopes to learn more about what attending law school looks like.
Henry said after just one phone call with her mentor, she learned about ways to study for the LSAT, and her mentor offered to look over a paper she is writing for GW’s undergraduate law review.
“I don’t have anyone in my family who is a lawyer, and I don’t know anyone personally who is a lawyer, so I wanted to get to know someone who goes to law school and has some more info about what attending law school looks like,” she said.
She said she was told to ask her academic adviser for guidance after Baker left GW but said her adviser doesn’t have the experience applying to law school that Baker had and that she hopes she can hear from her mentor.
“I absolutely would [recommend the program] especially with not having a pre-law adviser on campus but also just getting another opinion about law school from someone who is closer in age and who went through the application process,” Henry said.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Samboy was the vice president of student engagement for the law school. He is the vice president of student enrichment services for the Student Bar Association. It is now corrected.

This year, owing to the pandemic, all of the women's basketball team's players are living together, which makes it easier for team captains to check in on player well-being, head coach Jennifer Rizzotti said.
Women’s basketball will rely on newcomers and veterans to lead the team into the 2020-21 season.
Over the summer, the program voted sophomore forward Faith Blethen, redshirt junior forward Neila Luma and graduate student guard Jasmine Whitney as this year’s captains. Head coach Jennifer Rizzotti said she challenged the trio to strengthen the team’s culture and shoulder the responsibility of helping the squad navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We’ve challenged Neila, Faith and Jasmine to be vocal, to celebrate, to lead, to give direction, to encourage, to make sure they’re noticing when somebody doesn’t seem OK both on and off the floor,” Rizzotti said. “And then make sure they have each other’s back when it comes to enforcing the behaviors that are important to our team.”
Rizzotti said the players live together this season because of the pandemic, making it easier for the captains to check in on the team’s mental and emotional well-being, whether it take the form of making food runs for the team or informally chatting with teammates.
She added that the three have emphasized leadership over the summer and are trying to foster a sense of unity to help push through the health crisis.
“We talked a lot this summer about leadership and team culture,” Rizzotti said. “We felt like that was the one thing that we could control over a time where we weren’t getting together physically.”
Luma is approaching her fourth year in the program and has spent the most time on the team under Rizzotti. She forged a key role on the court her freshman and sophomore seasons, but she succumbed to a knee injury last year that sidelined her for all but five games.
During her year on the sidelines, Luma took on a mentor role with Blethen, encouraging the then-freshman to use her voice and grow as a leader on the team. Blethen said she used the virtual meetings with the team over the summer as an opportunity to develop as a leader and think about the kind of culture she wanted to build with the help of Luma.
“Over the summer when we were leading different discussions on what we wanted our culture to look like, I got pushed to be in a lot of different speaking roles and organization roles,” Blethen said. “I guess I was able to, with that distance, kind of experiment a little bit with my voice.”
Because of her online leadership, Blethen said it felt “really natural” to hop back into a leadership role when the squad returned to Foggy Bottom.
Despite only having one year of collegiate basketball under her belt, the team believed Blethen was the right one for the job when they voted her captain, Rizzotti said. Blethen has no shortage of experience and was one of four Colonials to appear in all 30 games last year.
Blethen is the first sophomore to captain the squad in Rizzotti’s five seasons with the program. She said her youth and energy will help the team bounce back after last season’s end.
“Coach Rizzotti was very confident in me, which gave me a lot of confidence,” Blethen said. “I’m very bought in. I’m very unapologetic about how much I love this team and how much I love GW athletics. Coach Rizzotti was very supportive of my teammates’ decision to put me in this position.”
Though a veteran of the sport, Whitney is a relative newcomer to the team after transferring to GW in the latter half of last season. Prior to her time at GW, Whitney played for Pittsburgh. She led the Panthers in assists for three straight years and was the only active player in the Atlantic Coast Conference to record 100+ assists in three straight seasons.
She is no stranger to the leadership position and was named a captain during her sophomore year as a Panther. Rizzotti said Whitney worked hard to build relationships and trust with her teammates during the spring semester and summer months and has helped cultivate a positive outlook on the upcoming season.
Whitney said she was thankful she arrived when she did because it allowed her to get acclimated to the program before the pandemic struck.
“We’ve been working really hard off the court to build chemistry, so I just want to be able to bring and help people gain confidence and come and show up every day and be that consistent voice and energy giver to others,” Whitney said. “I think my experience, that consistent, calm factor and just giving everybody else confidence so everyone can shine.”

The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered the course of Provost Brian Blake's first year in office, he said.
After serving as GW’s provost for one year, Brian Blake said he plans to continue to work on improving the University’s standing despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
Officials announced last October that Blake would take over after then-Provost Forrest Maltzman stepped down. Notwithstanding the pandemic, Blake said he has been able to implement new academic programs and is working to gather more feedback from students and faculty moving forward.
“I’m actually quite honored to have this role at such an institution,” Blake said.
Bolstering academic programs
Blake said that one of his goals as provost was to work closely with deans to implement new academic programs and improve GW’s academic offerings.
He said in the past year he has worked with Anuj Mehrotra, the dean of the School of Business, to overhaul the business school’s Master of Business Administration program by expanding student engagement efforts, program curriculum, career services and experiential learning.
Blake said he has also worked to implement a new Ph.D. program in global health and another in biostatistics in the Milken Institute School of Public Health, which he said is “really important” during the pandemic.
He also oversaw the start of the development of an academic master plan, which he announced would be paused earlier this month in light of “faculty fatigue” during the pandemic.
He said he also oversaw the implementation of the flex-start policies that officials announced for graduate students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science and Elliott School of International Affairs in April and May, respectively, to begin their programs online.
Tackling the COVID-19 pandemic
One of Blake’s major tasks was to oversee the development of University President Thomas LeBlanc’s strategic plan, but officials needed to pause the initiative and address the COVID-19 pandemic. Blake added that without a strategic plan, his work with deans has become “spotty.”
Since the health crisis hit, he altered several of his other goals. He said one “real success” of his first year was working with the Faculty Senate, Student Association, deans and faculty to implement a Pass/No Pass policy for the past two semesters.
Officials said in an email announcing the policy this semester that Blake will partner with SA leaders and the senate to help determine whether officials should implement the pass/fail policy again next academic year.
“As a provost and certainly as a president, what you find out is that it’s hard to be too visionary because people will immediately want to know details, and it’s hard to be too detailed because people will say, ‘I didn’t have any involvement,’” he said.
He said because of the pandemic, he hasn’t been able to work on as many academic initiatives, with the exception of a few like a research partnership between the Black Student Union, Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service, sociology department and the Metropolitan Police Department. He said the initiatives that top officials have been leading this year have largely been related to the pandemic, like the COVID-19 testing facility that officials opened in April.
“When I look back, the types of things that we actually got to work for were kind of all pandemic-related,” Blake said.
Garnering feedback, looking ahead
Blake said he’s worked to meet with various department heads, program leaders and student groups online to garner feedback about his performance. He said he’s learned about how communication with the deans, students, faculty and Faculty Senate is “important” because it is easy to misrepresent information.
He added that he recently approached two students to start an advisory committee for the provost’s office, but the project is held up because officials are “struggling to get things established” during the pandemic.
“I met with every department head in Columbian College, I met with every program in the College of Professional Studies, one-on-one,” Blake said. “I think I’ve been to town halls multiple times at every school through a certain period of time.”
Blake said going forward after the pandemic, officials will need to form a plan to evaluate and “think introspectively” about GW’s academic and co-curricular offerings.
He said he also hopes to be able to take advantage of what officials have learned throughout the pandemic like the increased flexibility of the academic calendar, the ability to offer telehealth services instead of strictly in-person services and asynchronous learning.
“Interactions with students doesn’t mean we’re always constrained with face-to-face,” he said. “Now it might be a combination of face-to-face with interactions outside of the classroom as well as for the more virtual WebEx types of things.”

Tom Guglielmo, the chair of the American studies department and father of two, said his role as primary caregiver to his children means he has to cram work into the morning or night while his kids sleep.
Professors’ days are typically filled with lectures, office hours and research – and the pandemic has added teaching their kids’ schoolwork to the to-do list.
Faculty members said they’ve needed to oversee their children’s virtual learning in addition to teaching their own virtual classes as schools throughout the region remain closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Professors said they’ve altered their teaching schedules to include asynchronous instruction and have worked early in the mornings or late at night to accommodate the responsibilities of having children at home.
Gayle Wald, a professor of English, said her 13-year-old son is managing online education independently, but she has trouble overseeing his daily schedule to ensure he stays organized.
“My son is pretty independent but still needs support in organizing his day and keeping up with school demands,” Wald said. “So I find myself constantly toggling between my work and checking in on him to make sure he’s on point.”
Wald said she’s worried that the lack of social interaction during the pandemic is particularly harmful to the development of any 13-year-old. But she said she’s grateful that she has the help of her partner to help manage her responsibilities and that her son can access the internet to complete school, which some parents don’t have.
“A couple of my son’s teachers are single moms, and I have tremendous respect and admiration for their commitment to teaching eighth graders during this pandemic,” Wald said in an email.
Ari Isaacman Bevacqua, an adjunct professor of audience development in the School of Media and Public Affairs and the director of communications at The New York Times, said she sometimes needs to work on-the-go in her car instead of at her desk at home to accommodate the needs of her 10-year-old son. She said finding the time to take her son to some sort of outdoor activity has allowed him to interact with other kids.
“He is doing roller blading right now, so I just sit and work outside of my son’s outdoor activities, and my car is like an office to me now,” she said. “I just sit there and work because I really want him to have some kind of interaction with other kids.”
Bevacqua said the last time her son attended in-person school was in March. Although she has to assist him with his online schoolwork sometimes, she said her son’s school has greatly improved the virtual education experience over the course of the pandemic, which has alleviated the need for her help.
“He can do a lot of things independently, but I want to find the balance where I’m there for him when he needs and I’m also empowering him to be able to learn,” she said.
Bevacqua said her son has been conscious of her time while she’s working and will step out of the room if he sees her colleagues on video call.
“When I’m teaching at night, he and I will make a plan in advance in terms of if he is going to work on some homework and then watch a show,” she said. “I will make a plan for his dinner and things like that in advance, and he kind of likes that because he gets an opportunity to do things on his own.”
Tom Guglielmo, the chair of American studies department and father of two kids ages 4 and 8, said he has been unable to entirely devote himself to his work since the pandemic began. He said since his wife has a more rigid schedule as an attorney, he has taken the responsibility of being the “primary caregiver” throughout the day.
“The 8-year-old can manage somewhat on his own, and he’s got schoolwork that can keep him somewhat busy maybe for half that time, but the 4-year-old, she is on the computer for school maybe an hour, hour-and-a-half a day,” Guglielmo said. “They are good at playing with each other and occupying their time a little bit, but basically I’m the full-time parent during that period.”
Guglielmo said this responsibility has forced him to alter his daily schedule to include time to work uninterrupted either in the mornings or at night while his kids are asleep. Teaching his class in a largely asynchronous style has helped him maintain this new schedule, he said.
“I record lectures so I can do that at night when the kids are in bed, or I can do that when they are busy during the day, so that has kind of worked out,” he said. “Some of the class is synchronous but not a lot. That again gives me some flexibility, a lot of flexibility actually.”
Guglielmo said even though there is some pressure to ensure his kids have social interaction outside of the house, his kids have been able to entertain each other and formed a stronger bond. He said he feels for single parents who are handling the pandemic.
“Everyone’s got their own challenges, so it’s just been really tough,” Guglielmo said. “But I think there is support in informal ways. I think people recognize that it’s a tough time in so many different respects for everyone, so I think there’s compassion.”
Jamie Cohen-Cole, an associate professor of American studies and the father of an 8-year-old, said his colleagues have been able to adapt his class schedule so he doesn’t have to teach at times that conflict with his daughter’s class schedule.
“The fact that my class times are what they are is in part because of what my daughter’s schooling schedule is,” Cohen-Cole said. “For instance, there is a GW time ban that is 8 a.m., and that would be good for some GW students, and I’ve taught at that time before. That would really not work this term. But I can say to my colleagues that I can’t teach at 8 a.m. this term.”

About 1,100 students applied for on-campus housing out of 1,500 available slots, and administrators expect 2,300 students to take up residence off campus, 200 fewer than usual.
Although the University plans to welcome more students back to campus this spring, officials expect off-campus students to outnumber on-campus residents by hundreds.
After administrators announced plans to continue online classes into the spring as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, they offered students to apply for an additional 1,500 openings for on-campus housing last month. But thinking GW would quickly deplete room openings, more than 10 students said they looked for off-campus housing instead.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said only 1,100 students applied for spring housing. With 500 students living on campus this semester, officials expect about 1,600 in total to occupy more than nine residence halls in the spring.
Nosal said officials expect the number of students living off campus during the spring to more than double the total number of new on-campus residents. She said 2,300 undergraduates will likely live off campus next semester, just about 200 fewer than the 2,500 students who are typically off campus during a regular school year.
“We anticipate the numbers to remain stable,” Nosal said in an email. “As a reminder, all students are required to update their mailing address based on their living semester for the current semester.”
Those totals would raise the number of students living in Foggy Bottom to nearly 4,000 – more than one-third of the entire student population. D.C. Zoning Commission officials have advised first- and second-year students without housing approval and who don’t live within commuting distance to stay out of the District during the spring semester due to health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic as cases continue to rise.
Students detailed plans last month to travel to D.C. ahead of the spring to move into either on-campus residence halls or off-campus apartments to regain a semblance of the normalcy of a regular college experience.
University President Thomas LeBlanc said at a Faculty Senate meeting earlier this month that about 140 students who received a spring housing assignment declined the option, which Leblanc attributes to climbing COVID-19 cases.
Henry Huvos, a freshman from Boston who studies political communication, said he and his friend from Arizona, who also goes to GW, decided to move to D.C. after officials announced that remote learning would continue. He said he didn’t want to risk missing out on a full semester in the District, so he took it upon himself to find a housing arrangement off campus.
“The email didn’t mention anything about housing, but I was in D.C. at the time for fall break and felt pretty confidently that I did not want to take any chance,” Huvos said. “So I messaged a friend of mine, and we began looking for apartments/hotels. By the time the lottery system was announced, we had found our place.”
Huvos said he considered applying for the housing lottery but ultimately opted out because he assumed a steep number of applicants would weaken his chances of on-campus approval.
“We didn’t want a situation where one of us got housing and the other didn’t,” he said.
Rachel Chambers, a freshman from Austin, Texas, said she plans to live in an apartment off campus with two other roommates from GW this spring. Although she initially hoped to live on campus, Chambers said she figured the lottery system would leave her with slim chances of getting into a residence hall.
“I initially was hoping to do on campus, but as soon as they said that it was going to be a lottery, I felt like a lot of people were going to apply and I just didn’t feel like I was going to get a spot,” she said.
Chambers said she also refrained from applying for on-campus housing because she wanted to allow students living in extenuating circumstances at home, who received priority housing in the fall, to have better access to spring housing. She said on-campus COVID-19 restrictions also dissuaded her from applying for a residence hall room.
“I was considering that it would be very strict with what went on in the dorms and stuff like that, and I was confident in my own abilities to handle COVID appropriately, and I didn’t really want to be very restricted,” she said.
Chambers said she and her roommates still intend to isolate themselves from the nearby community, and the group drafted a “COVID contract” to restrict themselves to a “pod” of one or two friends and to only leisure in open spaces outdoors.
Emma Carbone, a freshman from New York who opted to live off campus, said she decided to live in D.C. this October when she visited her friend living on campus. After realizing she didn’t want to leave D.C., Carbone said she extended her stay from two to four weeks and began the hunt for an off-campus living accommodation.
When Carbone heard the news about on-campus housing for the spring semester, she said she was already waiting to meet the subletter of an apartment near campus.
“I decided since I found such an ideal apartment that I didn’t want to risk losing that deal and apply for on-campus housing,” she said.

Members of a student effort to support the homeless population of an encampment across from the Elliott School building allege that D.C. is trying to evict the people living there under the guise of cleaning the area up. 
Senior Yannik Omictin spent a Saturday late last month digging through feet of wood chips to re-earth the grounds of a homeless encampment on the 2000 block of E Street.
The wood chips were the remnants of a homeless encampment cleaning during which District officials cleared out settlements to cut down tree branches ready to fall on the surrounding area. After the cleaning, wooden bits were left scattered across the site.
Omictin, who was elected to the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission earlier this month, is one of a dozen students contesting the District’s homeless encampment cleanups. He said the group is working to connect students with locals experiencing homelessness to help them move their belongings out of harm’s way during a city cleanup.
“What I’m really upset about is the city has failed unhoused people time and time again,” Omictin said. “It’s not just about sanitation. Obviously, the fact that they are unhoused, to me, is a city failure to regulate the housing market properly, a failure to provide ample social services, a failure to make sure people are safe and have a healthy, dignified existence.”
In a cleanup, or “engagement,” the District gives encampment residents two weeks’ notice to vacate “when a site presents a security, health or safety risk and/or interferes with community use of such places.” Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic advising cities to stall full homeless encampment cleanups, the District has continued the practice.
The CDC guidelines, last updated in August, warned that conducting cleanups could increase the potential for infectious disease spread after residents disperse from their encampment.
Omictin said while the group doesn’t have a long-term plan for combatting homelessness evictions and cleanups, the group will work to aid individuals experiencing homelessness “whenever and wherever possible.”
During the E Street cleanup late last month, Omictin said many residents didn’t move their belongings until the last minute with the hopes of returning later that day. He said involved students arrived at the encampment site the morning of the cleanup to help residents evacuate.
“That morning, a lot of folks were in a bit of a rush, as is normal,” Omictin said. “You see the big bulldozer come by at 10 in the morning sitting there on the side of the road and you’re like, ‘Oh, shoot! I’ve got to move my stuff out.’”
As the bulldozer slowly crept in, students, encampment residents and other locals scrambled to move belongings out of the vehicle’s way, but many tents and sleeping pallets were damaged in the process, he said.
After students left the site following the cleanup, Omictin said city workers with the District Department of Transportation started trimming branches off nearby trees that were at risk of falling onto encampment residents. He said the workers left around 2 p.m., but when students and encampment residents returned, they found the old campground smothered with plant debris.
“They left behind a massive pile of debris of wood chips or tree debris,” Omictin said. “In some places, this stuff was like 2 feet high. You could literally sink into it if you put your foot in it.”
Senior Dylan Basescu, who helped shovel out the encampment site, said he thinks city workers intentionally spread the wood chips across the encampment’s surface to ensure the unhoused residents weren’t able to pitch their tents upon return. Basescu said while the cleanup wasn’t intended to officially evict residents from the area, the sharp, wooden terrain prevents future settlement.
“If you try to pitch a tent on wood chips, it’s going to tear the bottom – unusable,” Basescu said. “You can’t sleep in that. You can’t even pitch a tent in it. It’s not a solid surface – it’s almost like sand. So we had to clear that, and this is not legal for them to do. They don’t do this when the cops are around.”
Basescu said students called the Metropolitan Police Department about the city’s manual efforts to prevent the encampment residents from returning, but police said they were busy and have never responded to concerns.
Despite a 15 percent decline over five years, the District is estimated to have the highest homeless population per capita of any American city with about 1,000 homeless per 100,000 residents, according to a 2019 report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Sward Tondoneh, the communications director for the District’s Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Beatriz Otero, did not return multiple requests for comment.
As D.C. continues to operate its encampment cleanups throughout the pandemic, experts in homelessness said cities providing more affordable housing options can help mitigate the struggles of unhoused individuals, especially during the pandemic.
Elizabeth Bowen, a social work professor at SUNY Buffalo, said city governments should work to ramp up social services, from providing hand sanitizer near encampments to funding long-term projects that connect people to housing, citing a California state-led project called Project Roomkey, which is providing unhoused residents private housing during the pandemic.
“Even if we don’t have the crisis of COVID-19, how can we get more people into housing more quickly and into ideally safe, permanent affordable housing?” she said. “This isn’t really a question of short-term shelter – that’s not a solution to homelessness – but how do we get more people into sustainable, safe housing?”
Stephen Pimpare, a social policy professor at the University of New Hampshire, said the cost of living is usually the biggest determinant of a city’s homeless population, and urban governments must start ensuring everyone with a job receives access to affordable housing.
“It’s a problem of access to affordable housing,” he said. “Plain and simple. There’s wide consensus from those who have studied it, saying that the first step is always to get someone in a home, to get a roof over their head.”
