Over the weekend, SA President Howard Brookins has been called on to resign amid claims of sexual misconduct from a female student and allegations of creating a "negligent and careless" work environment.
Updated: Jan. 25, 2021 at 6:36 p.m.
Since early December, more than a dozen Student Association cabinet members have resigned their posts, some of whom at the time of their departure claimed SA President Howard Brookins created a “negligent and careless work environment.”
Then, less than a week after the most recent flurry of departures, a female student came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Brookins.
Now, dozens of student leaders – including the majority of the SA Senate – are pressing Brookins to resign. Brookins did not return a request for comment about the sexual misconduct allegations or the calls for his resignation by the time of publication.
Most cabinet members who left have kept mum about what transpired in the organization prior to their departures, and when sexual misconduct claims emerged, they did not return requests about whether they knew about the allegations at the time of their resignation. One now-former cabinet member, alumnus Gaurav Gawankar, declined to say why he resigned “due to threats of legal action” from Brookins.
Current and former SA leaders said that if Brookins does not resign on his own accord, the organization could possibly initiate impeachment or censure proceedings, adding that the SA must be a space for women to feel comfortable working.
Departed SA members stay silent 
As of Jan. 16, 14 SA cabinet members have left the organization. Gawankar, who served as Brookins’ chief of staff before graduating last semester, said he resigned Dec. 8. Former Senior Policy Adviser Nicole Cennamo said she stepped down Dec. 28, but she declined to say why.
Former Chief of Staff Shealyn Fraser said she left Jan. 16 because of “poor communication” within the SA. She said as other cabinet members were resigning, “it became clear that the positive work environment had rapidly declined.” Fraser said she stepped down before sexual misconduct allegations surfaced, but she had heard “rumors” of the claims, which in part led to her departure.
“I personally believe Howard should resign at this point if we want to gain upward traction again in advocating for students,” she said last week in response to how the SA should respond to the cabinet resignations.
Six departed cabinet members – Senior Policy Adviser Amy Martin, Director of Interfaith Engagement Julia Kerrigan, Director of Student Advocacy Arzina Lakhani, Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion Hannah Edwards, Director of the Arts Hannah Clayton and Deputy Chief of Staff Bairavi Sundaram – did not return requests to say when they left the SA or why they resigned. The former members left sometime between Nov. 28 and Jan. 16, according to Internet archives.
Former Vice President for Academic Affairs Liz Gonzalez, Director of Graphic Design and Assistant Vice President for Public Affairs Cat Oriel and Vice President for Campus Operations Anna Weber resigned Jan. 16, claiming mismanagement in the executive branch. The trio declined to say whether they knew about the sexual misconduct allegations when they resigned.
In a resignation letter Dec. 28, then-Vice President for Government Relations Yannik Omictin said he was leaving the SA because of “irreconcilable personal differences.” Omictin declined to say whether he was aware of sexual misconduct claims at the time he left the SA.
“The best members of the Student Association have been those who treat their responsibilities to help students as privileges, do not confer upon themselves an inflated sense of power and hold themselves deeply accountable for their actions,” he wrote in his letter. “I will not tolerate those who do not do so, nor those who treat their tenure in the SA as anything more than a student position, serving among fellow students.”
Three of the remaining members of the branch – George Glass, the vice president for financial affairs; Karina Ochoa Berkley, the vice president for sustainability and a Hatchet opinions writer; and Anna Adler, the director of student engagement – published a joint statement Friday night calling for Brookins to step down. The letter states that the “few” remaining members of the SA could not “stay quiet” knowing the SA has a “credibly accused sexual harasser” in its leadership.
SA members consider impeachment, censure proceedings
SA Executive Vice President Brandon Hill said in an interview Saturday that senators are looking into the possibility of initiating a censure or impeachment trial. He said Monday’s senate meeting will likely determine how the body chooses to act based on whether Brookins attends the meeting and how he takes “accountability” for himself.
Hill said he has not been able to reach Brookins for the past few days.
The SA Senate has the ability to initiate impeachment proceedings – which could result in removing Brookins from office – or censure proceedings – which could result in a formal expression of disapproval and could include other repercussions apart from expelling Brookins from the organization, according to the SA’s constitution and bylaws.
University policy states student organizations cannot take action against an individual for violating GW’s policies. Hill, the executive vice president, said in an earlier interview Saturday that the senate can only impeach a member of the SA if they violate the organization’s bylaws.
“The senate is prepared to make him take accountability, but I don’t know how he can move forward morally without recognizing the hurt he’s caused,” he said.
He said in an interview last week that finding new members to fill the vacancies is a top priority. There are currently three applications out for the first three positions that became vacant, which will “hopefully” be filled at Monday’s meeting, he added.
The confirmation process for students applying to vacant positions will follow all standard protocols, Hill said. Vice presidential appointments and new members must be confirmed by the full senate, he said.
“The senate is still going to treat them like any other member seeking confirmation, if not harder, knowing that they’ll have to work twice as hard to learn more about the Student Association, the operations of the University and support students throughout the remainder of the term,” Hill said.
Drew Amstutz, the former vice president of undergraduate student policy who resigned Jan. 16, said he ultimately decided to leave the SA earlier this month when he was told about the sexual misconduct claims the female student described in her tweets Friday.
“That, combined with the ineffectiveness of the cabinet, I decided it was in the best interest for me to remove my support from Howard, try to stay in the Student Association in some form, but to get out from under Howard,” he said.
Amstutz said the SA must focus on “healing,” and Brookins either needs to resign or be impeached. He added that the SA should ensure a woman serves in at least one of the body’s top three positions – either as president, executive vice president or senate pro tempore.
“At the end of the day, if we can’t get our internal struggles rectified, we’re not going to be able to advocate on behalf of the entire student body when it comes to these issues,” Amstutz said. “And these are systemic issues at GW that need to be corrected.”

Students joined the Georgia Senate race mainly by phone banking and friend banking to campaign for the Democratic candidates and win control of the U.S. Senate.
After learning of voter suppression in Georgia during the 2018 gubernatorial election, now-freshman Shivani Desai looked forward to helping people get to the polls in her home state’s 2020 Senate race. 
Desai said when the election rolled around in November, she had been helping manage and create content for then-Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff’s social media. Then, after the election headed to a runoff, she said Ossoff’s campaign team merged with then-Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock’s, and she worked along other interns to ramp up attention to the two candidates through TikTok.  
Desai is one of five students who said they’ve volunteered for the two Democrats’ successful campaigns for Georgia’s senate seats through phone banking and canvassing. The students, all of whom are from southern states, said they wanted to help the U.S. Senate secure a Democratic majority and encourage a more progressive agenda in the South.
“I learned that it really makes a difference if you have it in your power to work for a campaign that you know is one of the best, if not the strongest avenue, to bring justice for your state and for the country,” Desai said. 
Desai, who volunteered for both Sens. Ossoff and Warnock’s runoff campaigns, said she credits former Georgia House Rep. Stacey Abrams, D-Ga., and other political activists for their push to flip Georgia blue through initiatives like the New Georgia Project, which helped increase voter registration, particularly for traditionally underrepresented groups like younger voters and racial minorities.
Senior Madeleine Deisen, a former Hatchet reporter and member of Swing Left – an organization that works to flip states from red to blue – said she spent 15 to 20 hours per week phone banking and friend banking, which includes reaching out to friends and family members to remind them to vote in the election. Deisen said friend banking was a more “personal” way to encourage people to vote.
“It doesn’t have to be your best friends, although, of course, that’s really powerful,” she said. “But even just an acquaintance, if someone that you know in your personal life and your real life asks you to vote, that’s a lot more powerful than a stranger calling you up on the phone.”
Since an additional runoff election took place in January after the regular election in November, Deisen said she and the rest of the coordinated campaign for both candidates wanted to ensure they reached out to young people, particularly Georgia college students who might not be living at the same location they were during the general election. To target this group, Deisen said she and other organizers used a voter mobilization tool called Reach to make it easier to reach out to friends and family with voter information.
When the election headed to a runoff around the time of final exams, Deisen added that she had a “tricky” time balancing her school work and her responsibilities for the campaign since she didn’t anticipate the campaign to continue past November.
“One thing you’re doing  – your job for the runoff election – is literally determining the fate of our country,” Deisen said. “And then it’s like, ‘Do I phone bank or do I write papers?’ It’s hard to find motivation to write your papers.”
Jack King, a junior who volunteered with the Georgia Democratic Party, said he participated in “Get Out The Vote Weekend” from Jan. 2 through Jan. 5 by canvassing in the Atlanta area. He said despite living in the neighboring state of Tennessee, he was driven to volunteer for the Georgia Democratic campaigns to win partisan control of the Senate.
“I am personally a very partisan Democrat and a progressive one at that,” King said. “The idea of at least two more years of Mitch McConnell controlling the Senate just did not at all sit well with me and I was concerned.”
Hailey Figur, a sophomore from outside of Atlanta, said she volunteered for Ossoff and Warnock’s campaigns through Swing Left GW after Deisen reached out to her via friend banking. She said issues related to gender equity pushed her to join the campaign trail.
“As much support as women can get in the pro-choice area, as well as equal pay, equal rights, that kind of thing – gender initiatives I think are safer in Democrats’ hands,” Figur said.
Figur said when she was younger, she never expected her traditionally Republican home state to flip. She said Georgia successfully flipping blue happened in large part because more Black voters showed up to the polls. 
Turnout among Black voters was 93 percent of that in the November election, while turnout among White voters was only about 87 percent of that in November.
“We saw the mobilization of millions of Black American voters who really turned out for this election and carried this election for sure,” Figur said. “And we really have them to thank, especially the organizers as well.”
John Lindholm, a junior who worked for the Lowndes County Democratic Party in the days leading up to the runoff elections, said he spent time checking in with prospective voters via door knocking. 
Lindholm, who is from New Orleans, said he enjoyed revisiting Southern politics, especially in a state as “competitive” as Georgia. He said the South is a region that often gets “overlooked” politically, particularly within the Democratic party, because it is typically controlled by Republican leaders.
“To connect with people in that region is so important, because they feel forgotten, and they feel like the political system does not work for them,” Lindholm said. “Trying to change that perception and show them that their votes do matter, and their votes can have an impact on national politics is so important, and I think it’s really empowering for a lot of people.”

Panhel chapter leaders received early access to GW-licensed Zoom accounts to conduct virtual recruitment this season.
Formal sorority recruitment participation continued its multiyear downward trend during the organization’s first virtual recruitment period during the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this month.
About 275 students participated in the Panhellenic Association’s sorority recruitment this year – an almost 20 percent drop compared to last year – and 214 were offered a bid, a formal invitation to join a sorority, student leaders said. The mark falls below last year’s participation in formal recruitment, which was at the time the lowest in at least 10 years, prompting all chapters to hold informal recruitment to reach more potential recruits.
Anne Graham, the director of student involvement and leadership, said the Office of Student Life connected Panhel leaders with resources, like advice from peer institutions’ chapters’ experiences leading virtual recruitment and early access to GW-licensed Zoom accounts for chapter leaders while organizing recruitment. She said the office also supported Panhel in removing the 12-credit minimum requirement for students to take part in the recruitment process to remove any barriers for students seeking to make connections in the Panhel community.
“The Office of Student Life has received positive feedback from chapter leaders, new members and chapter advisers on virtual recruitment,” Graham said in an email. “We are extremely proud of the Panhellenic Association executive council and of each of the chapters for their ability to continuously adapt to the changes and run recruitment successfully in the virtual environment.”
Senior Morgan Islam, the vice president of recruitment for the Panhellenic Association and a member of Sigma Delta Tau, said she remained “on call 24/7” throughout the week in a separate Zoom breakout room, considered Panhel’s “headquarters,” with other executive sorority leaders. She said chapters’ recruitment chairs could contact them for help on how to run their online events and expand their membership.
“I really do think that potential new members were still able to have genuine and authentic conversations about values with our members, which is at the heart of our recruitment process,” Islam said in an email.
She said chapters presented their values and philanthropy efforts on the first night this year, taking the place of what is usually an evening to hold casual conversations with members. She said the switch offered potential new members additional information about each chapter and the recruitment process that they may have not had access to in the fall.
“They didn’t get to experience being in classes with sorority women, witness their public philanthropy events, get to know them in other student organizations or even just see their letters around campus,” Islam said. “This unfamiliarity with our chapters put this group of PNMs at a disadvantage when it came to making informed decisions about where they wanted to end up.”
Senior Alexa Saberito, the president of Panhel and a member of Sigma Delta Tau, said all 10 chapters are hosting continuous open bidding, an informal recruitment process, so she cannot confirm how many bids have been accepted. Last year, three sororities – Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Beta Phi and Sigma Delta Tau – held informal recruitment.
Continuous open bidding, which began on bid day, allows chapters to extend invitations to students who did not end up in a chapter after formal recruitment or did not go through formal recruitment processes, Saberito said.
“269 PNMs were eligible and 214 received bids,” she said in an email. “Our continuous open bidding process is currently underway so I expect most of the PNMs that constitute that discrepancy will end up joining the Panhel community.”
She said Panhel and the student life office eliminated its 12-credit hour requirement after many freshmen reached out to her directly saying they had deferred their admission to GW until spring because of the pandemic.
“As always, we want there to be as few obstacles to joining our community as possible, and we saw the 12-credit requirement as an unnecessary barrier,” Saberito said in an email.
She said this year participants also submitted either a video or short essay answering questions about their own personal values so chapters could familiarize themselves with applicants prior to rush week.  
She added that the organization’s recruitment registration process is “largely” influenced by each chapter’s campus presence, so the pandemic forced members to reach out to potential new members through virtual means like school emails and social media.
“Besides the obvious fact that we were not in the Marvin Center and able to have in-person interactions, our process really wasn’t all that different,” Saberito said. 
Seven chapter presidents did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Kappa Delta declined to comment due to not being allowed to speak to media.
Katie Menello, the chapter president of Pi Beta Phi, said virtual recruitment went “surprisingly well” for their chapter this year. Pi Beta Phi will also hold informal recruitment, according to the chapter’s Instagram.
“Pi Phi was so excited to welcome 20 incredible new members [so far], and we are looking forward to even more women joining our sisterhood soon through the informal recruitment process,” Menello said in an email.
Sophomore Hannah Merenstein, the chapter president of Sigma Delta Tau, said the chapter has already welcomed 20 new members but will continue to hold informal recruitment to invite more students to join. She said “very few girls” had signed up for recruitment by the deadline to register for recruitment, prompting the deadline to be extended a week.
She said getting to know potential new members virtually was challenging because learning about each person online wasn’t the same as reading a person’s actions in person. She said to combat the difficulty of connecting online, the chapter hosted multiple breakout room sessions dedicated to sisters and potential new members connecting with each other.
“We made it very clear that if they were feeling uncomfortable at all, or just needed a break, because it is so exhausting sitting on Zoom all day, to just be honest,” Merenstein said. “Just to make sure that they had the support they needed.”

At the top of the second quarter Sunday, freshman forward Caranda Perea nailed a jumper to give women’s basketball a 14-point advantage over Saint Joseph’s. But the lead was short-lived – the Hawks put up 29 points in the second quarter, raining 21 points from beyond the arc.
A fourth quarter push from GW brought the team within two points, but the comeback attempt proved futile as the Hawks (4-1, 2-1 A-10) toppled the Colonials (4-9, 1-6 A-10) 63–61. GW dropped its second straight game and has just one win in conference play.
“We just didn’t really move the ball as well as we did to start the game,” head coach Jennifer Rizzotti said. “I thought we got impatient. We got a little bit stagnant, a little bit sticky with the ball. I thought we fixed some of that in the second half, but it still ended up being something that hurt us down in the end.”
Freshman center Ali Brigham led the team in scoring, notching 16 points and firing at a 45.5 clip. Graduate student guard Sydney Zambrotta and graduate student guard Jasmine Whitney followed with 13 and 12 points, respectively. Whitney led the team from three-point land, knocking in two triples.
Graduate student guard Alayna Gribble led the floor with 17 points for the Hawks, hitting 5-of-9 from distance. Junior guard Katie Jekot followed with 14 points, netting 4-of-7 from deep.
GW shot at a 41.1 percent clip, hitting five treys on 14 attempts. Saint Joseph’s hit 44.4 percent of their shots, including a 12-of-26 clip from the three-point line.
“I thought we did a poor job especially in the second quarter of identifying and getting out to their shooters and making them put the ball on the floor to score,” Rizzotti said. “We got a little bit better as the game went on, but we gave up a couple of key threes late in the game when we needed some stops.”
Each team turned the ball over 13 times. The Colonials forced seven turnovers, while the Hawks forced nine turnovers. GW’s turnovers had been on the decline throughout conference play but spiked on its road trip to Pennsylvania. In the first five A-10 games, GW averaged 9.8 turnovers, and in two games against La Salle and Saint Joseph’s, the team averaged 16.5.
“Today we were also very careless with balls – something that we’ll have to take a look at as the coaching staff and see if we can figure it out,” Rizzotti said. “But it certainly has been a big reason why I believe that we’ve lost the last two games, because we haven’t been able to take care of the ball like we did in the prior couple of games.”
Zambrotta, Brigham and redshirt junior Gabby Nikitinaite combined for a six-point run to start the first quarter. A jumper from sophomore guard Kaliah Henderson broke the Hawks’ two-minute scoring drought, but Nikitinaite responded with a triple to extend the lead to seven.
The Hawks could only muster six more points in the remaining seven and a half minutes as the Colonials jumped out to an early 20-8 lead. Five different Colonials contributed to the team’s scoring.
Saint Joseph’s entered the second quarter with renewed vigor as it fought to outscore the Colonials. A three-pointer by junior forward Elizabeth Marsicano began a downpour of triples from the Hawks, including four consecutive three-point buckets.
The Colonials fell into two three-minute scoring droughts in the second frame, which the Hawks used to go on an 8-0 run and 12-0 run, respectively. Saint Joseph’s outscored GW 29–8 in the second frame after four different players combined to shoot 77.8 percent from beyond the arc.
Down nine at the half, Brigham scored four straight points to open the third frame and cut the deficit to two possessions. GW and Saint Joseph’s traded buckets, and neither team was able to build up consistent momentum.
Both teams struggled to get shots to fall in the third quarter. The Colonials hit just 3-of-10 from the field, and after their efficient second quarter, the Hawks completed just 4-of-14 from the floor. GW dominated the charity stripe, getting to the line 12 times and knocking 10 attempts down throughout the game. Four of those baskets came in the third quarter.
In the final quarter the Colonials began staging a comeback, outscoring the Hawks 23–17. A layup and a pair of free throws from Brigham and back-to-back triples from Whitney worked to keep the deficit to single digits.
A three-pointer from Perea with 17 seconds on the clock shortened the Hawks’ lead to four points. Whitney hit a jumper with a second remaining to bring GW within two, but the team couldn’t secure the comeback, dropping the game 63–61.
“We’re still at a place where we’re still not able to be consistent for an entire game,” Rizzotti said. “We’re going to have to be if we want to be one of the better teams in the league. We’re going to have to show up. We’re going to have to play hard on both ends of the floor. We’re going to have to take care of the ball.”
The Colonials are back on the road Wednesday to take on VCU. Tipoff is set for noon.

In a year in which many institutions of higher education suffered financially from the COVID-19 pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz said the credit reports are welcome news.
Standard and Poor’s Global Ratings affirmed GW’s “A+” rating, according to a report and University release earlier this month.
S&P Global Ratings, a Manhattan, New York-based credit rating agency, designates GW as having the capability to meet its financial obligations and commitments but being somewhat susceptible to “changes in circumstances and economic conditions” during the COVID-19 pandemic. The A+ rating provides a signal of confidence in GW’s financial standing as officials mitigate the $180 million annual budget gap caused by the pandemic and enrollment shortfalls.
The rating by S&P mirrors a similar report released by Moody’s in October, which also affirmed GW’s positive financial outlook even as the agency downgraded its outlook for the higher education industry as a whole.
“The positive assessments and stable outlook from S&P and Moody’s are important external validations of the University’s financial strength and our ability to continue to support our core academic mission far into the future,” University President Thomas LeBlanc said in a release.
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz said the reports by Moody’s and S&P are welcome news for GW administrators and investors amid contractions in the industry during the pandemic.
“Giving us a stable outlook in an industry where there is inherent turbulence, even before the pandemic that has just now maybe exacerbated some of it, to me, says a lot about where GW is,” Diaz said.
He added that administrators responded to the pandemic by matching GW’s expenditures to what would be possible with the University’s “conservative” revenue projections as classes remained online with the majority of students not returning to campus.
“It’s not that the pandemic took us off guard,” Diaz said. “There’s a number of things that we were looking at in terms of, improving the business process and eliminating inefficiencies and redundancies.”
Although the student experience looks different during the pandemic, Diaz said officials are working to still make GW an attractive option for current and prospective students.
“We were looking at a number of those things across the University and where we can also enhance the value proposition,” he said.
Diaz said short of unexpected shifts in enrollment, like a large number of students leaving GW or refusing to take virtual courses, the University’s financial structure should be able to remain stable without taking “extraordinary action.”
“With bringing a thousand more students on campus in the spring, that really is an effort to make sure that we continue to build our capability,” Diaz said. “So we might, if we’re caught in a similar situation in the fall, have at least the opportunity to consider bringing more residents back.”

The Foggy Bottom Food Pantry located at United Methodist Church is back up and running after shuttering during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A local food pantry is back up and running after shutting down in March during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
George Madill – a volunteer at the Foggy Bottom Food Pantry, housed in The United Church on G Street – said the pantry first shuttered due to food shortages and renovations before returning last month with “limited food stocks” and a few clients who were aware of the reopening. He said volunteers are working to rebuild the pantry’s operations and clientele, now offering curbside delivery and virtually contacting clients about the service reboot.
“I hope that it keeps people from starving,” Madill said. “People that don’t have money to buy the food or don’t have sources for food, if we can help them out, they come over here, they can pick up food.”
After reopening last month, Madill said volunteers are struggling to account for food shortages and a dropoff in local customers. Aside from the pantry’s listing with Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office and the Capital Area Food Bank, Madill said staff members are messaging clients with contact information and advertising the pantry on Facebook and the church’s website to amplify community awareness.
“The clients haven’t found out that we’re open again, but they’re starting to, and they’re starting to come back, so it will be a while before we get as many clients as we had before the pandemic,” he said.
Madill said the pantry has also been shortchanged on food supplies after the food processors and manufacturers that shut down last year strained the distribution system for local suppliers, like the Capital Area Food Bank. He said volunteers and community members can’t do “that much” to resolve this issue that is influenced by shortages facing the “food supply chain.”
“It’s getting better now, but there was kind of a squeeze on food,” he said. “Everybody’s trying to get the same food, so people were going hungry.”
He said volunteers are now looking to open market vendors like Costco or Giant to offset the supply dropoff, which has left local food banks competing to dole out their remaining supplies to clients amid high demand. He said the pantry accepts “grants and donations from individuals and organizations”, but the number of clients the pantry is able to attract will ultimately determine how well it feeds community members in the area.
“We’re competing with each other,” Madill said. “The food banks are competing with the commercial grocers, competing with the government even, for food to supply to people.”
Madill said the pantry will remain open on its pre-pandemic schedule on the second and fourth Saturday of each month from 10 a.m. to noon.
Kevin Rost, the church administrator at The United Church, said the pantry’s clientele dropped from about 125 to 300 families before the pandemic to now just between 25 to 50. He said the pantry sets income and family size eligibility requirements for clients.
Rost said community members now receive food products at the pantry in a box instead of walking through the pantry and picking items off the shelves, like they typically would before the COVID-19 outbreak. Many clients are currently unaware of the pantry’s reopening, he added.
“The word has not gotten mailed that we’re reopened,” he said. “The clientele are not necessarily connected electronically, not like you have an email list and can email and say, ‘Hey, we’re open again.’”
Rost said he hopes to continue benefiting the local community before hopefully returning to indoor food distribution in the future.
“The hopes and goals are that we can get to serve the people who need to be served and eventually that we can return to inside service so that it’s a much more personable experience,” he said.
John George, the president of the Foggy Bottom Association, said the pantry has a decades-long history of helping struggling community members, like furloughed federal employees and laid-off workers, in need of extra supplies. He said the pantry is “critically necessary” during the pandemic as a center where volunteers help connect those community members with food.
“The Foggy Bottom Food Pantry is a critical and important resource in Foggy Bottom and the West End and for the city,” he said. “It brings the only necessary food supplies to those in need but also is a centerpiece for others in the area to contribute their talents and service for the organization.”
George said he plans to raise donations, promote the pantry around the neighborhood and discuss its services at the FBA’s upcoming meeting Tuesday to increase local awareness. He said students could also volunteer and aid the struggling food pantry.
The United Church’s website states people can volunteer on Saturdays or during the middle of the week and can contact the church office for more information.
“It’s about awareness,” George said. “It’s about communicating that people are in need and that organizations that serve are needing assistance.”

Rachelle Heller, the director of the Center for Women in Engineering, said 13 pairs of mentors and mentees have participated in the center's mentorship program since its start this summer. 
More than a semester into a mentorship program for female engineering students, participants said the program has provided guidance in building resumes, establishing professional relationships and preparing for job interviews.
Officials from the School of Engineering and Applied Science’s Center for Women in Engineering said they launched the mentorship program last July to connect students with alumnae who can share career advice. Mentors said they have been able to learn from their students about how to adapt to working in a virtual environment, and mentees said they have benefited from the advice they received about working in a male-dominated field and preparing for jobs and internships.
Rachelle Heller, the director of the center and a professor of computer science, said the mentorship program has attracted 13 pairs of mentors and mentees since its start in the summer.
She said mentors have noted that the training materials officials provided them were helpful as part of their general feedback. The program’s website includes resources like a mentoring toolkit, which features tips on active listening and starting “difficult conversations” for mentors.
Heller added that the officials leading the center are promoting the program through a “variety of channels” and are working to improve the program “as necessary.” She said officials will work to expand the program based on feedback they have received directly from the mentors and a survey distributed to mentees.
“Our students have responded well to the program, even with the current constraints of remote learning,” she said in an email.
Evalyn Maxwell, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering, said she joined the program to have a mentor to assist her in building her resume and preparing for interviews for potential internships and future jobs. She said her mentor’s experience in the workforce has given her “insight” into the experience of being a woman in STEM and what she could do to further her own career prospects.
“Even though I only meet once a month with my mentor, I think it’s for a good amount of time because it gives us enough time for any possible changes within my academics and current job applications,” Maxwell said.
She said even though participating in the mentorship program online can have drawbacks like “weird” internet connections, it has been convenient since she doesn’t have to worry about spending time commuting to meet her mentor.
Monica Uribe-Francisco, a senior majoring in systems engineering, said her mentor helped her with networking by passing along her resume to potential employers and introducing her to colleagues working in computer engineering.
“Some of the things I’ve been able to do with my mentor in this program is not only talk about full-time jobs and how to prepare for that but also what it is to be a woman in the field of engineering, especially as a woman of color in my case,” Uribe-Francisco said.
She said as a first-generation college student, she was looking for help with navigating “life after graduation,” so she wanted to take advantage of the opportunities that GW offers while she is still in school.
“In the future, I would like to see this be something we possibly do from now on because I’ve really enjoyed it, and I think other girls not only in my situation but girls in STEM in general could benefit a lot from this program for their career goals and other educational or professional goals they might have,” Uribe-Francisco said.
Claire Silverstein, a visiting civil engineering assistant professor and three-time SEAS alumna in 2013, 2015 and 2019, said her mentee has had a positive experience with the program so far and now has access to a professional network that she can build on while fostering relationships at GW and beyond.
“If you have had a good experience as a mentee, hopefully one day you will mentor other people,” she said. “I think just having it full circle, having that support system as you go through schooling and as you enter your career is really important.”
Silverstein said the experience she had with mentors when she was a student at GW helped her pursue paths like graduate school and was also an outlet for her to discuss frustrations and receive advice. She said her knowledge of the “inner-workings” of higher education as a student and part-time faculty member gives her a “unique” perspective when giving her mentee advice or bouncing ideas around for possible careers.
“I hope more people take advantage and participate as mentors and as mentees because again more support can never hurt,” Silverstein said.
Tanya Ford, a SEAS alumna and mentor, said it’s “especially important” to provide mentorship opportunities for women in STEM because of their underrepresentation in the field. In recent years, women made up less than 25 percent of jobs in STEM fields, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
“It’s critically important that not only we begin creating programs such as this one but that we also work on ways to sustain them,” she said.
Ford said participating in the program virtually has allowed her and her mentee to be flexible in setting times to meet with each other. But she said she has faced setbacks since she can’t take her mentees to physical locations if they are interested in learning more about a specific work site.
She said during her time as a mentor she has been able to learn from her mentee’s “willingness to be adaptable” with her studies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Not only have I been able to deposit nuggets and give her words of wisdom and best practices but she’s also helped too in terms of being adaptable, flexible and open-minded when it comes to limitations,” she said. “It’s been a rewarding and a great experience for not just her but for myself as well.”

Honors Program students said they are still waiting for progress on many of the suggestions they made regarding diversity and inclusion in the program.
The University Honors Program released a report earlier this month outlining the changes that officials made to its curricula and admissions policies in the fall to support diversity efforts.
The report states officials have surveyed freshmen about their experiences with diversity and inclusion in the program, plan to host diversity and inclusion workshops for those involved in the program and are working to create a webpage to publicize the progress of UHP’s diversity and inclusion efforts. Students in the program said they felt the report was a step in the right direction, but they are still waiting to be updated on many of the suggestions they made to the program’s diversity and inclusion committee last year.
Bethany Cobb Kung, the director of UHP and an associate professor of honors and physics, said the program’s diversity and inclusion work is ongoing, and officials expect it to continue “long term.”
Kung said students, faculty and staff have been “highly engaged” in efforts to support diversity and inclusion in UHP by recommending improvements to the program during workshops and at bias trainings. Faculty have been working to update their course syllabi to be more inclusive by adding new material that covers current diversity issues, she said.
“I know that some of the best online reading discussions in my class this fall were focused on readings that I added because of some of the discussions we had over the semester,” she said in an email.
Kung said officials also implemented a new course substitution policy after several students, faculty and staff had indicated an interest in it, but she declined to say how the policy fits in with the program’s efforts to support diversity and inclusion. The policy, which will be implemented as a “trial run” for the next academic year, will allow students to petition to take a course outside of UHP’s offerings that will still count for the program’s requirements, the report states.
“This policy will help to increase the flexibility of the program so that it is easier for all of our students to fully complete the program requirements during their time at GW,” Kung said. “Additionally, this will allow students to take a course on a topic – or with a faculty member – that they are really excited about but which we are not currently able to offer through the program.”
Kung said the diversity and inclusion workshops that officials have held for UHP community members – led by Jordan West, the director of diversity and inclusion education – have helped participants become more comfortable discussing issues of diversity and inclusion and learning the relevant terminology for these issues.
“Following our student workshop this January, we asked students for feedback, and we hope to learn from that survey how the workshop was helpful and how we can make the event even more beneficial in the future,” she said.
She said some of UHP’s work around diversity and inclusion only requires time and effort to examine and change certain procedures. Kung said in the long term, officials support hiring more faculty members to “bring new voices and areas of expertise.”
Students launched the UHP Black, Indigenous People of Color Collective last September to advocate for inclusive policies and a safe space for BIPOC students in the program. The collective was originally part of the program’s diversity and inclusion committee, but some students later resigned, citing a lack of understanding from UHP officials of the work students put into the committee.
Kung said students of the BIPOC collective have remained in contact with officials and raised concerns that she said administrators have incorporated into their short- and long-term goals, like enacting changes to the program’s sophomore admissions process.
“For example, students from the BIPOC Collective have remained in direct communication with Program Manager Brianna Crayton,” Kung said. “They corresponded with her about the details of the UHP sophomore admissions process, provided feedback for improvements to the process and volunteered to speak on student panels at information sessions about sophomore admissions.”
Carolyne Im, a junior majoring in political communication and a member of the BIPOC collective, said the group decided to leave UHP’s diversity and inclusion committee last fall because they felt officials did not take seriously any of the suggestions that the collective offered.
Im said officials have reached out to the collective to “re-engage” with the committee. She said officials are moving in the “right direction” to increase diversity and inclusion, but they are not the necessary “concrete changes” that the collective is looking for.
“Because we know that if we do decide to step into that space again, it will likely be the same thing,” she said. “And so even though they have been making steps in the right direction – I think that’s really great – I think the fundamental relationship between students and admin hasn’t really changed, or if they are working on that, we haven’t seen the effects of that yet.”
She said students in the collective want to ensure officials are implementing “quantifiable measures” to measure the impact of efforts to support diversity and inclusion.
Fryda Cortes, a sophomore majoring in political science and a member of the collective, said she was concerned that officials had not actually implemented the changes in course syllabi, as the report says it does. She said when she attended a bias training for UHP that was largely attended by freshmen, many of them expressed similar concerns that their course materials lacked diversity.
“Although the report may say this is something we’re working on, we still haven’t been able to see those results as first-year students are still complaining about this,” she said.
