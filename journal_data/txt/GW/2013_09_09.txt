Upon her recruiting visit to GW last fall, freshman softball outfielder Marissa Mangini was asked her top three reasons for wanting to become a Colonial. The first two answers she listed off – GW’s location and academic prowess – have been common for the last couple decades.
But her third answer – facilities – is a new response, and is becoming increasingly common as GW tries to lay the groundwork for an athletics resurgence. The millions of dollars spent on new athletics training facilities, refurbished courts and spruced-up playing fields over the last few years seem to be leading to a recruiting boom.
“On some of the other visits I went on, the fields were more like [recreational] fields, I guess you could say. Very low-maintenance, nothing special,” said Mangini, a three-time first-team All-State selection in Florida.
“But when I came to GW, we now have a turf outfield, and I play outfield, so that’s awesome,” she added.
Athletics department officials are seeing that more highly coveted high school stars are picking GW over Bowl Championship Series teams, other Atlantic 10 schools and some Ivy League colleges because of the University’s new facilities.
Just this season, the women’s volleyball and baseball teams have seen one of their best and largest recruiting classes in recent years, with the women’s basketball team patiently prepared for a stellar 2014 class.
Every summer, the athletics department hosts hundreds of sought-after athletes who are asked to complete a survey that details the other schools they are considering and the reasons they would want to come to GW.
In 2012, more than 150 athletes took the survey, with none saying that facilities would factor into their decisions to don Colonials’ uniforms. But this summer, 60 percent of the 157 potential recruits put facilities among their top three reasons for wanting to play at GW, just behind academics and location on the survey.
“Coaches all over the place will tell you that facilities are important, and we’ve addressed a lot of that,” athletics director Patrick Nero said.
GW, of course, isn’t coming close to putting up the kinds of $100-million locker rooms and stadiums seen at sports behemoths like Oregon or Alabama. But since Nero put in motion an athletic strategic plan in 2012, athletes have seen an explosion of upgrades to facilities.
On the Mount Vernon Campus, the University resurfaced and redesigned both the soccer field and tennis courts. In Arlington, Va., GW put $3 million into renovations for its baseball field, Barcroft Park, which now boasts a turf field, batting cage and press box. In the Smith Center basement, GW installed a fully equipped golf simulator and indoor batting cages, in addition to the nationally recognized new basketball court design.
The upgrades carry over the momentum from the $40 million renovation of the Smith Center that was completed three years ago.
Next week, state-of-the-art locker rooms in the Smith Center are set to be revealed. The department would not yet reveal when exactly the locker rooms will open, and declined to provide a cost of the renovations. Officials said the renovations would be paid for with fundraising dollars from the Buff and Blue fund.
The renovations partially stem from GW drawing up its own halftime strategy to bring life back to the athletics department. After a committee of trustees and administrators found that GW’s athletics budget floundered toward the back of the A-10, the department has seen more internal dollars and bulked-up fundraising. It raised more than $1 million last year, and is gunning for more this year.
“I think each of the programs are feeling it. I think it, again, reinforces to them, ‘Hey, you have a university that is supporting you,'” Nero said, “And I think that results in them putting a much different focus on their athletic competition.”
The added dollars play toward the Colonials’ natural financial advantage, as GW has the second-largest endowment in the A-10, trailing only Richmond.
More than just facilities
Nero has done more than just bring an array of construction workers to campus, though. He has also attracted a new breed of head coaches – all with long lists of credentials – that are doing their own part in attracting recruits.
“The facilities have been the most drastic sign that people see everyday, but I would say internally, the student athletes and staff and coaches would say that a – what we would call a ‘Raise High’ attitude, is very different,” Nero said. “Everyone here understands that being a Division I athlete means that you take pride in representing your university and wanting to win, and that’s become a very big focal point.”
For three years, freshman point guard Shannon Cranshaw was committed to play women’s basketball at the University of Georgia, a team that has been nationally ranked in the Top 25 every year since she joined the team.
Coaching changes at Georgia and a realization her senior year about wanting to build a better life after college basketball, however, led her away from Athens, Ga. and straight to the Smith Center.
Facilities upgrades, like the new court and locker room designs, were key factors in Cranshaw’s decision, she said, but the biggest was the opportunity to play under a high-level coach like Tsipis.
“The reason, in the end, from a basketball perspective, was to play under a coaching staff of Coach Tsipis and his associate head coaches and assistant coaches, and just the opportunity to be a part of a program that’s on the rise.”
The idea of “stealing” recruits away from marquee sports programs – like Cranshaw’s example – is still a work in progress for Nero and company.
According to GW’s 2012 recruiting survey, 14 of the 150 athletes visiting also considered BCS schools, nine were looking at Ivy League schools, and nine other A-10 schools.
This past summer – just a year later – the number of BCS schools jumped to 24, Ivies to 41, and A-10 schools to 28.
“For us, it’s continuing to target a high school student who is achieving at a very high level academically, but also can be athletically similar to one of the top athletes in the country,” Nero said.
Internal development
Recruiting is a tricky business. So tricky that the NCAA has pages upon pages of regulations regarding when and how a coach can contact a player. There are cross-country flights, meetings in familys’ living rooms and usually about 20 other schools doing the same thing for the same player.
It gets even trickier for GW, a school that prides itself on being a research institution of high academic standing. Finding kids that excel both on the field and in the classroom greatly reduces the recruiting pool that GW can choose from.
“I leave the specifics of those kids to the coaches. Our job is saying, ‘All right, what is it gonna take,'” Nero said. “Why would a student from San Francisco wanna come to GW and row if they’re a top student, you know, over the Ivies, Stanford, Washington, [California at Berkeley]?”
But in his short time at GW, Nero has fostered an attitude throughout the athletics department that puts the success of all programs, not just basketball, as the top priority. A recent example: the reinstatement of the track and diving programs, moves that will do little financially for the department, but gives the cross country and swimming teams a greater chance at an A-10 championship.
That type of change may be hard to determine on a survey, but to the recruits and current student-athletes, it’s important.
“When you think of other schools, you think of like football or basketball programs, but the fact that they put so much into softball because it’s such a growing program, it’s really awesome to see that,” Mangini said. “That’s one of the reasons I chose GW, because it had the academic, but they also had the athletic part; that they care about softball, which is a sport that not a lot of people watch or think is interesting.”

Professor Jason Osder sits in his office in front of his video editing setup. Osder's documentary on the Philadelphia race riots will be distributed nationally this fall.
Jason Osder’s documentary, “Let the Fire Burn,” opens with a shot of 13-year-old boy – one of two survivors of a 1985 bombing that left a Philadelphia neighborhood smoldering and nearly lifeless.
Osder, whose home was just miles away from the attack, said that clip inspired him to start creating his documentary more than a decade later. It’s a powerful part of the 90-minute film that has already received a variety of accolades and will debut Tuesday at the West End Cinema.
“I knew that would be the very first scene in the film,” said Osder, a professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs. He has spent about 10 years working on the film. “It went through a billion edits, but that scene stayed true.”
Osder was 11 years old when the city was embroiled in a police standoff with the black liberation group MOVE. Officers deployed two pounds of explosives into a city housing complex. Eleven people died – including five children.
“You don’t have the frame that an adult has, of race or police brutality, so [my first thought] was to the kids, and how all the authorities that were supposed to be protecting them failed,” he said.
It was a defining moment for him, he said, similar to the way others remembered the assassination of John F. Kennedy or 9/11.
After he completed his master’s degree at the University of Florida, he landed a teaching gig at GW, and continued the 10-year process of collecting photographs and video footage from local newspapers and city records to tell the story.
After years of work, the film appeared at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, where it won an award for Best Editing and was nominated for Best Documentary Film. Osder also earned an honorable mention for Best New Director.
Unlike many documentaries, which feature voice-over narration, “Let the Fire Burn” relies solely on archival footage and news reports. GW also helped produce the film, and the University’s legal arm helped secure the rights to that footage.
The film’s editor, Nels Bangerter, said the structure of the film allows audiences to draw their own conclusions.
“What’s unique about setting this film in 1985 and only in 1985 is that it encourages audiences to make connections, and Travyon Martin, the Austin Grant shootings, they hadn’t happened when we started thinking about the film, it just keeps coming up,” Bangerter said.
Mike Shanahan, who co-taught a multimedia reporting class with Osder until this year, helped connect the director with his cousin, a retired FBI agent who investigated the bombings in Philadelphia.
He praised Osder’s documentary as the first major piece to give an in-depth look at the attacks.
“It captured a cultural dilemma in American society in a way that no one else had done,” Shanahan said.
The film’s early success has also followed Osder to the classroom.
Gabe Felder, a senior who took Osder’s digital media production class last fall, got an early look at the film. He said he was wowed by the clips, which he said also gave the professor “a sense of credibility” in the field.
“You tend to think, ‘Those who can’t do, teach,’ but when you see something this tangible, you can watch it, you can see their own skill and you certainly gain a little bit of respect you didn’t have beforehand,” Felder said.
The West End Cinema will hold a special screening of the film Sept. 10, with SMPA director Frank Sesno moderating a question-and-answer session after the screening. The film will open across D.C. in December.

Piers stretch out from the end of King Street into the Potomac River.
I went to Old Town Alexandria for the first time expecting a theme park-style, colonial period recreation in the style of Williamsburg, Va. After all, this was George Washington’s old stomping ground.
You know the deal: men in tricorn hats and stockings bowing flamboyantly to women adorned in bonnets, speaking in British accents, while boys in wigs march to Revolutionary War-era tunes with their drums and piccolos.
But I was pleasantly surprised. Old Town wasn’t tacky, nor did it feel like an empty office development devoid of human life like much of Foggy Bottom does on the weekends. King Street was alive and bustling with pedestrians enjoying the sunny day.
The city’s main draw is its rich history. American history geeks must tour Gadsby’s Tavern Restaurant, where George and Martha Washington, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams often stayed. During the year, Gadsby’s also hosts many historical reenactments, a cheesy guilty pleasure.
Stop by Christ Church to see its classic English country-style steeple jutting into the skyline, visible throughout the city. Both George Washington and General Robert E. Lee attended services here.
But Alexandria appeals to more than just history buffs with an impressive art scene. You cannot leave Old Town without visiting the Torpedo Factory Art Center. Once a government torpedo factory, the building is now a world-famous non-profit co-op where 165 artists work.
The center boasts 82 studios, six galleries and an archeology museum, but its best feature is its interactive nature: Visitors are encouraged to enter the studios, watch the artists work and ask questions. All three floors are worth an exhaustive tour, but my favorite artist was Lisa Schumaier, who crafts eerily-lifelike, funky paper mache statues and handmade bottle cap magnets.
Alexandria has its own unique identity, something difficult to find in a region comprised almost solely of Washington commuters. Although it is off the beaten path, I would definitely take out-of-town visitors here, ready for a day of hands-on history and art.

Imagine a GW campus where students do little else but attend classes. The average week consists of sitting in a classroom and doing homework, getting a few extra hours of sleep, and repeating this monotonous routine the next day.
In this fictitious world, internships don’t exist, and they aren’t part of the GW culture like they are now.
This might sound absurd – but it could soon become the reality.
Even though most students enter college anticipating the completion of two or more internships – usually unpaid – these opportunities are under threat.
The debate over whether internships should come with a salary is being fueled by an influx of lawsuits, mostly by former interns who demand compensation. Perhaps the most publicized of these legal battles was the case against Fox Searchlight Pictures, which lost their lawsuit and is now required to pay two interns who worked on the production of the movie “Black Swan.”
But internships without wages do pay. Without them, hands-on experience for college students disappears. Professional references are unavailable. Students lose the valuable opportunity to check out various workplaces.
It is understandable that not all college students can afford to work without being paid. Financial difficulties are increasingly common among undergraduates as the nation recovers from a recession and tuition continues to skyrocket.
But this unfortunate economic situation shouldn’t devalue unpaid internships. While they do not offer immediate monetary benefits for a student’s work, they do offer something else: experience, references, networking opportunities and the all-important resume booster. That’s a long-term investment that will lead to even higher salaries later on.
As college students, we jump at the opportunity to gain more experience or pad our resumes during the school year. In fact, most of us do things for which we aren’t immediately compensated. Whether it’s giving tours to prospective students, becoming an executive board member of a student organization or participating in an alternative break, we all put in valuable hours – but we don’t get paid. This time could easily be spent studying or finding a paying job, but most of us are involved because we have convinced ourselves that benefits will pay off in other ways.
The same is true for unpaid internships. They matter for our resumes and our futures, and these lawsuits threaten to take these valuable opportunities away.
An undergraduate resume without internships is a limited one – especially at a school like GW, where so many students intern on the Hill, at partisan think-tanks or lobbying firms. These grin-and-bare-it positions demonstrate a students’ ability to work hard and sacrifice for the bigger picture.
Our advisers, professors and mentors have always told us that to succeed, we need to differentiate ourselves. One unpaid summer internship could be the defining difference between two job candidates. But if these jobs vanish because of legal pressure to pay interns, students won’t be able to have these opportunities which undoubtedly help them in the long run.
In an ideal world, requiring companies to pay their interns would benefit everyone involved. Hiring managers would become more selective, choosing only the hardest working candidates. Interns would be paid. The company itself would have a more valuable employee on its hands. The situation sounds perfect. But is this really what we can expect?
No, it’s not. If laws do change to reflect some public demand, uncompensated internships will become few and far between. Employers might make the argument that they are not able to afford paid interns. These lawsuits could scare away corporations from taking on interns that they now have to compensate. And this hurts unpaid interns far more than the ones filing lawsuits realize.
The money will come later – but only if we accept unpaid internships as an undergraduate rite of passage.

Jack Evans, who represents Foggy Bottom on the D.C. Council, has come under investigation by the city's ethics board twice in his months-long bid for mayor. 
Foggy Bottom representative Jack Evans has already faced scrutiny from the city twice in his three-month-long bid for mayor, but longtime followers of city politics predict it will have little impact on his chances next spring.
Evans, the longest-serving D.C. Council member, was under investigation by the D.C. ethics board last week after a GW student alleged he struck a “sweetheart” land deal with GW for political support.
Another allegation surfaced Wednesday, with the city investigating Evans for supposedly violating campaign finance rules by collecting multiple donations from the same donor.
The inquiries could be troublesome for Evans, who has campaigned on a clean record and history of ethical decision-making. He also helped pass Council legislation to increase transparency in bookkeeping.
But Evans has denied both allegations, and experts agree that neither probe will have a lasting effect on his campaign.
Matthew Green, a political science professor at Catholic University, said that while Foggy Bottom is a “core constituency” for Evans that may be turned off by the land deal, the neighborhood represents only a small proportion of voters.
“Corruption can be harmful for elected officials and candidates, or even alleged corruption, but it’s hardly a guarantee that someone will lose an election,” Green said.
Inquiries must be dramatic, he said, but also simple enough to grasp for the average voter, who may not closely follow city politics.
“We’ve had politicians alleged to have done very complicated financial transactions that are difficult to understand, and those issues sometimes confuse voters,” Green said. “People understand when politicians are caught in a car with someone who is not their spouse. Those things are important in terms of how an alleged act will affect the election.”
Evans, who is running against five other candidates – including fellow Council members Tommy Wells and Muriel Bowser – is a favorite among the downtown business community. He  has campaigned on a record of supporting major development projects like the Verizon Center and Nationals Park.
Georgetown resident Carol Baume, who gave $100 to Evans’ campaign in February, said the Council member’s track record matters more to her than the investigations.
“I have lived in D.C. almost 20 years now, and I have been to lots of meetings and events where he has spoken, and I have followed how he conducts business, and he seems like a very reasoned and straightforward person,” Baume said, adding that she plans to donate to Evans’ campaign again.
Still, Howard University political science professor Lorenzo Morris said even preliminary investigations are important to voters because the probes could raise doubt about Evans’ clean reputation.
“Generally, voters respond seriously to violations of financially inappropriate behavior or a hint about personal corruption,” Morris said. “For Jack Evans, the critical factor is that he has to present, more than anything else, a clean image.”
Incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray’s 2010 campaign has been the subject of an ongoing federal investigation, but he has denied he had any knowledge about the hundreds of thousands of dollars in undocumented donations under scrutiny.
It’s another wound in a city that was scarred by political corruption when Council member Marion Barry, who served four terms as mayor, had a tenure marred by embezzlement, a $110-million budget deficit and an arrest for cocaine in 1990.
With the city waiting to see if Gray will seek re-election, Green said much could change before the Democratic primary in April.
“That’s almost an eternity in political time. For even that reason alone, it’s way, way too soon to say if these allegations will have an affect,” Green said.
This post was updated Sept. 9 at 11:20 a.m. to reflect the following correction:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported the number of terms Marion Barry served as mayor.

Over the summer, a strange thing happened: The unwashed masses of unpaid interns broke their shackles and slew their oppressors.
Of course, this is hyperbole, but you get the point. In June, a federal district court judge in New York ruled in favor of former unpaid interns who sued Fox Searchlight Pictures for compensation. The interns had performed menial tasks like taking lunch orders and organizing filing cabinets.
That opened the floodgates, as lawsuits at organizations like Gawker Media, Warner Music and Condé Nast are now also underway.
These developments are encouraging, but the very fact that interns have to take corporations to court to be compensated means that we are having the wrong conversation about internships. At GW and in D.C. – a haven for interns, paid and unpaid – that conversation is even more critical.
Not all interns experience the horror stories referenced in the lawsuits. But this does not exempt companies, nonprofits and other potential employers in the U.S. from their collective moral failing in allowing a generation of laborers to become accustomed to unpaid work. This sets us back instead of pushing us ahead.
Before the bright-eyed intern makes his or her first pot of coffee, we must acknowledge that the idea and practice of unpaid internships in the modern economy is strangely immoral. Unpaid interns are little more than modern indentured servants by another name, and they should be financially compensated for their work.
To wit, the Department of Labor has published guidelines for hiring unpaid interns under the Fair Labor Standards Act. It lays out six criteria that, if all met, define a certain position as a supposedly legitimate unpaid internship.
Many of the lawsuits from former interns hinge on an argument directed against the second and fourth criteria: “The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern,” and “The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern and on occasion its activities may actually be impeded.”
Reading these two rules in quick succession invites cognitive dissonance to anyone who has interned. How can you have a beneficial and substantive experience without actually helping the corporation that you work for? Even if you’re only pouring coffee or making copies, you’re still helping the institution.
These guidelines don’t make sense, and they should be discarded – along with the practice of unpaid internships altogether.
That’s because the class of people who can afford to take unpaid work is small, creating systematic economic inequality before those workers even leave college.
Besides, the majority of companies that hire interns can afford to pay them a minimum wage anyway. The CEO of NBC makes a base salary of $2.24 million per year, Condé Nast is turning double-digit gross profit growth per year and Fox Searchlight is a giant media conglomeration. The idea that they can’t or somehow shouldn’t compensate interns due to financial constraint is absolutely ridiculous.
Yes, those in favor of internships argue that students receive valuable experience from networking opportunities and face time with important professionals in your field of interest. They say it gives students an early peek into the working world.
But this capitalist society – where money drives success – is placing a higher premium on the amorphous concept of experience than our own finances. For every moment we’re not being paid for filing papers and writing memos at our internships, we’re losing money we need to sustain our lifestyles.

The District’s top chefs stepped out of their culinary element Friday to create fashion designs so good you could taste them.
The Heart of America Foundation transformed the Mandarin Oriental Hotel into a chocolate wonderland Friday night for its annual Charity in Chocolate fundraiser. The event challenged chefs from restaurants like La Tasca, SEI, Béarnaise and Café Milano to create looks with confections for a chocolate fashion show.
Literary characters inspired all the designs on the runway. Chefs paid homage to “Hunger Games” protagonist Katniss Everdeen, Pocahontas, the Mad Hatter and the Ugly Duckling, all dripping in chocolate and sparkling with sugar.
Caitlin Dysart, pastry chef at 2941 Restaurant, took home the top honor with her masterpiece “Snow Queen,” constructed almost entirely of shaped, hardened sugar.
“It’s really, really exciting because as pastry chefs we get to use special techniques and then just do something out of the box that we don’t get to do in our daily job,” Dysart said.
The show was judged by local D.C. tastemakers, including Michael McCarthy, editor-in-chief of D.C. Magazine, Heather Roth, 2008 RAMW Pastry Chef of the Year, and Kate Michael of K Street Magazine.
Event proceeds went to The Heart of America Foundation, which has worked with over 200 libraries and educational spaces, and provided more than 3 million books to children since its 1997 founding.
“It’s just a wonderful way for people to come together, to really celebrate not only the great chefs that are donating so much to make a difference in this community, but also just to come together to celebrate our children and celebrate our schools in the District of Columbia,” said Angie Halamandaris, The Heart of America Foundation co-founder and president.

Gregory Maggs has served as interim dean of the GW Law School since January, after former dean Paul Schiff Berman stepped down.
The search for the next head of the GW Law School will begin this month, with plans to pick the top three candidates by the spring, Provost Steven Lerman told professors last week.
Faculty will likely select a national firm to help lead the search this fall, said professor Roger Transgrud, who helped steer the school’s last dean hiring in 2010.
It will be the school’s first time hiring a search firm, a method that’s commonly used among universities to broaden their applicants, often to the world outside of academia. Still, Trangsrud said the committee will likely interview top officials from other schools, rather than leaders of top companies or law practices.
“The dean of a Top 25 law school is almost certain to come from the professoriat, so the need is not as strong for a firm. But most feel that it couldn’t hurt,” said Trangsrud, who holds an endowed chair as a professor of complex litigation and civil procedure. He was an interim dean in 2004, and also led the committee that picked the school’s former leader, Paul Schiff Berman.
The search will be a test for the law school after it experienced turmoil last fall. Berman abruptly resigned from the deanship in November after just 18 months in the position. Faculty say he left the deanship because he was about to face a vote of no confidence, and the discontent pushed him into a role in the provost’s office leading GW’s online learning operation.
The law school has been under the temporary direction of Gregory Maggs since January.
The field of candidates will take shape over the next semester, and will likely draw interest from legal heavyweights. The law school is ranked No. 21 in the country, and boasts top research programs in international and intellectual property law.
Some faculty members have floated the school’s Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Christopher Bracey, a recently appointed administrator with a bevy of research credentials, as a solid internal candidate. In 2010, only one GW professor made it to the top eight candidates.
Candidates will be vetted by a GW-led search committee, which will likely include a trustee, a law school graduate, a member of the provost’s office and a member of the dean’s advisory committee.
The committee will narrow down the applicants starting this winter, Trangsrud said. Off-campus screening interviews will likely start in January and finalists will make campus visits in February and March – similar to last year’s search for a leader of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.
Nationally, this year’s challenges for law schools include the declining number of legal jobs available and the plummeting number of applications to law schools across the country, Trangsrud said.
He noted that a dean needs to be a strong fundraiser and communicator, adding that the school’s size – one of the largest law schools in the country with more than 2,000 students – makes this more difficult. The school boasts an operating budget of about $80 million, and tries to fundraise up to $10 million a year.
The school has also struggled with fundraising since Berman left, said Rich Collins, associate vice president for law development. Fundraising increased under Berman’s leadership, part of the reason he was selected for the deanship. But, fundraising has also slumped because of a poor legal job market, Collins added.
The University of Alabama’s law school, tied with GW’s at No. 21 – according to U.S. News and World Report rankings – will also conduct a dean search this year, after its dean of 10 years retired suddenly over the summer.
GW will also conduct a search for the dean of the nursing school, after Dean Jean Johnson announced she would retire at the end of the academic year. The University may start a search for a new business school dean this year, as well.
Lerman declined to comment on plans for the law school search because he said details were not yet available.
