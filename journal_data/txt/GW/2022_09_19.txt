Mei R. Fu previously served as the senior associate dean for research at Rutgers School of Nursing-Camden.
Officials announced a new dean of the School of Nursing in a news release Monday.
Mei R. Fu, the senior associate dean for research at Rutgers School of Nursing-Camden, will take the helm of the nursing school, filling a position that has been left without a permanent leader after former Dean Pamela Jefferies stepped down from the role in March 2021. Officials said in a news release that a search committee of trustees, faculty, staff, an alumna and students selected Fu for the top nursing school spot.
Provost Chris Bracey said Fu’s background in clinical partnerships and history of research makes her positioned to expand research opportunities and create a plan for growth as dean of the nursing school.
“She is energetic and passionate about joining with partners in order to support cutting-edge nursing research and prepare the next generation of nurses to become experts and leaders, and she will build upon the school’s already considerable strengths,” Bracey said in a release.
Slaven-Lee, the nursing school’s senior associate dean for academic affairs and interim dean, served in the interim position starting in July 2021 and will continue until January, when Fu is slated to take the helm.
“Dr. Slaven-Lee has been a valuable member of the provost senior leadership team and a strong and steady leader of the School of Nursing, working hard on behalf of all students, faculty and staff and helping the school continue to advance its mission,” Bracey said.
The U.S. News and World Report ranked the School of Nursing as the No. 22 best graduate nursing program in the United States for administration and leadership last year.
The release states that before joining GW, Fu served as the senior associate dean for research at Rutgers School of Nursing-Camden. She also held the inaugural Barry Family and Goldman Sachs Endowed Chair of Professorship in Nursing at Boston College Connell School of Nursing as well as faculty positions at New York University, according to the release.
“I am looking forward to working with the brilliant students, faculty, staff and alumni of the school who are committed to excellence in patient care, health equity and high-quality teaching and research,” Fu said. “Together, we will continue a path of success to advance GW Nursing and further expand the positive impact we have in the communities we serve locally, nationally and internationally.”
Fu studied in China and obtained bachelor’s and master’s degrees and earned a bachelor of science in nursing, a master of science and a doctorate in nursing science at the University of Missouri-Columbia, the release states.
In 2017 Fu was inducted into the International Nurse Researcher Hall of Fame, Sigma Theta Tau International, and has received awards from the Oncology Nursing Foundation throughout her career as a researcher and nurse scientist, according to the release.

No Lost Generation GW, a student organization that advocates for and supports refugees, hosted the event, which was moderated by Sean McCarthy, the Fall Director of Government Relations of No Lost Generation GW.
A humanitarian worker who fled from Afghanistan discussed his journey to the U.S. and his work with the Office of Refugee Resettlement at an event Tuesday.
Zafar Azam – who works in the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services – talked about his experience as a refugee and the issues people fleeing conflicts like those in Ukraine and Afghanistan face. No Lost Generation GW, a student organization that advocates for and supports refugees, hosted the event, which was moderated by Sean McCarthy, the Fall Director of Government Relations of No Lost Generation GW.
Azam said he was born in Afghanistan during the 1990s, a time period in the country marked by turmoil due to the civil war and the first Taliban takeover. He said he fled Afghanistan as a child with his five siblings and his mother due to the Taliban takeover in the mid-1990s.
“We were stopped a lot of times, and we made it into Pakistan,” Azam said. “There were a few years for my family until we got accepted as refugees and moved here.”
Azam said he and his family moved to Iowa after being granted refugee status to live in the United States. But, he said the process of leaving his home and adapting to a new home in the United States exhausted his family.
“I can remember the first two years, my mom still wanted to just go back home,” Azam said.
Azam said he joined the Office of Refugee Resettlement to help Afghan refugees adapt to their new homes in the wake of the U.S. pulling out of Afghanistan. He said he uses his experience in his job talking with refugees to “shape” policy and build programs.
“We actually just started a new team, it’s kind of the work that I’ve been doing and doing more community outreach, talking with the refugees themselves instead of just resettlement agencies and contractors,” Azam said.
Azam said individuals have many opportunities to support refugees during their resettlement in the United States whether through advocacy work or helping individual refugees by working with local organizations that assist in resettling refugees. He also advocated for the passage of the Afghan Adjustment Act, a bill in the U.S. Congress in August by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., that aims to expand “eligibility for special immigrant visas to certain Afghan nationals,” like former members of the Afghan Air Force.
“You have to take initiative and just be curious and look and see what you can do,” Azam said. “I was always great about plugging myself into everything wherever I can. To say something or offer my help, I would do that.”

Leaf has wanted to tell stories about Brian Wilson since his time as The Hatchet’s music editor in the early 1970s, during which he said he assigned himself albums and concerts to review, including those by the Beach Boys.
The Beach Boys haven’t topped the charts with a new song since 1988’s “Kokomo,” but for music author and GW alumnus David Leaf, the story of the group and their frontman Brian Wilson is still worth telling.
Leaf – an author, director and UCLA professor of music industry – is doing just that in his new book “God Only Knows: The Story of Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys & the California Myth,” which releases Thursday. The book is a roughly 150-page expanded version of a biographical opus Leaf originally published in 1978, recounting Wilson’s career and creative frustrations as the primary artistic mind behind many of the band’s hits like “Wouldn’t it Be Nice” and “Surfin’ USA.”
Leaf wanted to tell the story of the iconic group and its innovative leader since his time as The Hatchet’s music editor in the early 1970s, during which he said he assigned himself albums and concerts to review, including those by the Beach Boys.
“The first pieces I wrote for The Hatchet were about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys,” Leaf said. “And that was where I began to tell the story that I was going to tell.”
Leaf attended GW from 1969 to 1973, studying business administration after realizing a journalism degree would be too much work. He said he first discovered Wilson and the Beach Boys while at GW about five years after their commercial peak. He said he went to a now-defunct record store near 13th Street and New York Avenue called Record City, where he saw a copy of Rolling Stone with the six long-haired Beach Boys sitting on the cover. The magazine featured part one of a two-part profile on the band.
He said the article enlightened him to the musical genius of Brian Wilson and the dysfunctional family that made up the rest of Wilson’s band. Both of these themes are prevalent in Leaf’s 1978 book, where he describes how the other members of the Beach Boys, particularly Wilson’s cousin Mike Love, prevented the artist from achieving his full musical ambitions in criticizing some of Wilson’s more personal work on the albums “Pet Sounds” and “SMiLE.”
One week after seeing the magazine, Leaf said he returned to the record store to purchase a copy of the Beach Boys’ 17th album, “Surf’s Up,” which he heaped praise upon through his review in The Hatchet.
“Both for their music and the return of Brian Wilson, who is definitely one of the best writers of melody in the pop spectrum, it is good to have them back,” Leaf said in his 1971 Hatchet review of the band’s most recent album.
Leaf said the discovery of his passion for telling the stories of the artists he admired pushed him to move to California, where he would go on to write a book on Wilson, befriend him and help him finish his abandoned rock album “SMiLE.” A version of the album, “Brian Wilson Presents Smile,” debuted in 2004, and Leaf produced a documentary on the release.
Leaf accomplished the first two goals of befriending and writing a book about Wilson in 1978 when he published “The Beach Boys and the California Myth.” The book chronicled Wilson’s early career, including his rise and the struggles he faced both creatively and personally, and featured interviews with Wilson and many close to him.
He said trust was one factor that brought him closer to the vibrant artist as a confidant. Leaf said Wilson spent most of his time with people on his payroll, so he lets his personality out more around people who will tell him what they actually think without fear that they’re only saying what he wants to hear.
He said the two have a normal friendship going swimming together, getting dinner with their wives and singing in the car.
“I mean, we just laughed a lot,” Leaf said. “He’s fun to be around.”
The friendship does still have its less normal parts. Leaf said the musician would ask Leaf to come on tour with him because Leaf would be the only person there as a friend while everyone else would be there as a co-worker.
“Friend, cheerleader, semi-ghostwriter, author, filmmaker, tribute producer, I fulfilled a lot of roles in his life,” Leaf said. “But the one that matters to him the most is friend.”
Leaf said while he acted more like a journalist trying to explain Wilson to the world in his 1978 book, the new edition focuses more on his own friendship with Wilson, adventures the two shared and personal memories from home and on the road.
“Obviously you can go on Wikipedia and read endlessly about everything, every album anyone’s ever done, every tour they’ve done, all that information is there,” Leaf said. “So me writing that is no longer valuable. What’s valuable is telling stories that only I can tell.”
One such adventure was when the two met the late Queen Elizabeth II of England in 2002. Leaf said he accompanied Wilson on his journey to Buckingham Palace, where he was invited to play at the Queen’s Jubilee. He said the guests were instructed to not speak to the queen unless she spoke to them first – a rule which Wilson promptly broke as he exclaimed “Hi Queen!” while the monarch walked by.
Leaf also decided to change the title from the original “The Beach Boys and the California Myth” to “God Only Knows: The Story of Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys & the California Myth.” He said the expanded title includes the name of one of Wilson’s most publicly beloved songs to evoke the spiritual nature of his music, in which the artist believes God speaks to the listener. And by adding the song title and Wilson’s name, Leaf said he wanted readers to understand this was a book about the creatively fruitful, yet artistically stymied Wilson as opposed to the entire Beach Boys.
“The truth is, when it comes to his story and why things have happened, you could literally shrug your shoulders and go ‘God only knows,’” Leaf said. “Because there are things that cannot be explained.”
Leaf’s writing about Wilson has helped readers realize and continue to understand the sheer influence of the ever-complex artist’s music and his triumph over his creative struggles.
Fourty-four years after the book’s initial release, Leaf’s published work has reached all ends of the music industry. He said he has received praise and compliments for his work from famous artists, including when he ran into legendary rock artist Tom Petty backstage at the 1991 Billboard Music Awards.
Leaf recalls Petty standing next to him backstage and leaning over to say “Great book, man.”
“The people who matter recognized what the book was because they already knew who Brian was, and they were thrilled that somebody had put it into print,” Leaf said of the interaction. “So I think that was, what I did was, I put Brian Wilson’s story into print in such a way that it couldn’t be denied.”

BSU leaders said the theme “Black Renaissance: Innovation Continued” will prompt students to create new norms by using figures from the Harlem Renaissance as inspiration for their work. 
Updated: Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2022 at 12:48 p.m.
The Black Student Union’s annual theme for the academic year is drawing inspiration from the Harlem Renaissance to replicate the innovation that came from Black artists during a historic period of creativity. 
BSU leaders said this year’s theme of “Black Renaissance: Innovation Continued” will motivate students to draw inspiration for fresh ideas from creative outlets, like writing or dance. They said the theme centers on the Harlem Renaissance – a period rich in Black cultural and artistic achievements during the 1920s and 1930s – and will feature a showcase of contemporary and archived student art and monthly community service at Martha’s Table, a nonprofit that provides food and education to D.C. families.
BSU President Gianna Cook said students will find an outlet to be their most authentic, creative selves on campus through the new theme that honors a time period when Black creatives felt empowered to influence and “bounce off each other,” whether it be through art or questioning the status quo. 
She said the title “Innovation Continued” aims to inspire Black excellence on campus following last year’s theme of “Elevation Amplified,” which worked to elevate Black student voices through relationships with administrators and student events during the first year back on campus since the COVID-19 pandemic. She said BSU hopes to continue to build a Black community on campus that allows students to push boundaries in their day-to-day lives through a steady exchange of ideas in class and in-person social engagement around campus, like at Kogan Plaza.
“We’ve always been innovative, we’ve always been striving for this creativity, and it’s not starting over,” Cook said. “I love that we’re also able to bring it to light not only to our community but to other communities in GW as well.”
Cook said BSU is currently planning events like a kickball game with American University’s BSU chapter on the National Mall later this year and a Thanksgiving dinner with the Undergraduate Black Pre-Law Association and BSU chapters from GW Law and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences. She said she hopes events like these will develop “collaboration” between BSU and other student organizations to amplify a sense of community under the “Black Renaissance” theme. 
“I think that as students, we’re always working, networking,” Cook said. “But how can we connect together and make those meaningful connections through creativity, through ideas, through fellowship and through those recreational activities? So that’s what we’re really working towards.”
Cook said the Black Renaissance theme encourages students to model how Black creatives had their ideas “propelled by everybody around them” to produce formative work and build the courage to create new norms, but she said the theme reaches far beyond music or art. She said she wants students to apply the theme to their own lives this year and feel motivated to think outside of the box and challenge themselves. 
“I want them to know that innovation can start with them,” Cook said. “And that whether you’re a freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, Black or not Black, that you somehow see that there’s something valuable that you have to offer the GW community.”
Drew Dodd, the executive vice president of BSU, said he is looking forward to BSU’s upcoming art showcase during the spring semester as an opportunity to reflect on Black successes on campus among past generations of Black students and those currently attending GW. He said he worked with BSU Historian Ryan Titus to pull archived photographs of past BSU members attending events or sporting their style in addition to artwork they created, which inspired this year’s theme and will appear in the art showcase. 
“We’re not the first people here who are doing what we’re doing,” Dodd said. “So when I saw the pictures that Ryan sent to me from our archives, it was honestly just an inspiring moment to see Black people in our school.”
Dodd said starting last year, he noticed a Black Renaissance that started to take form at GW when his peers began to tap into their own creativity by producing art or showing off their style. He said he hopes to build off this innovation on campus through this year’s theme to highlight a time when Black art was appreciated and inspired others to harness creativity.
“Yes, we are talking about the Black Renaissance, and that’s a completely separate time in history, but we’re also talking about the Black Renaissance at GW and acknowledging the past and building on that with the creatives that we have on campus now,” Dodd said. 
He said attending a predominantly white institution can produce obstacles to creative expression for Black students, but he is interested in gaining a glimpse of history through the artistic work dating back to the 1960’s that will be presented in the showcase.
“I know for me coming to a PWI, it can be a little bit challenging just to feel a little bit out of your depth, so I can’t imagine how they felt 20, 30, 40 years ago, but it’s admirable,” Dodd said.  “I think a big part of the idea of the theme was just the acknowledgment that there were people before us.”
Titus said the new theme makes her feel “proud” and “empowered” in her role educating students about the relevance of Black history to their lives. She said she hopes students excel in their own talents by learning from the successes and failures of figures from the Harlem Renaissance like poet Langston Hughes, who inspires her by his ability to show the universality of the Black experience.
“It is up to us to use what we have learned from them and improve ourselves,” Titus said in an email.
Telease Bowen, the co-chair of the annual Black Heritage Celebration, said this year’s theme offers students a time to explore their passions and reflect on the creative outlets that appeal to them to spark “Black joy.”
“I hope that students take this time to reflect on what makes them happy, joyful and really get back to those things, whether that’s knitting or drawing or painting,” Bowen said. 
Joanna Destil, BSU’s vice president of marketing, said she hopes the upcoming year will allow students to serve as inspiration for one another. She said she hopes students recognize that failing is a part of the creative process that the Black Renaissance theme advocates for through its focus on innovation and inventiveness. 
“It is okay to fail, and by failing you will succeed,” Destil said. “There’s ways you can succeed.”

Student leaders said ACLU-GW is seeking to establish a list of consistent members and create a chapter constitution during the fall.
The American Civil Liberties Union is starting a chapter at GW this fall to protect national civil liberties through student-led advocacy on campus.
Student leaders said they formed the GW-based chapter of the ACLU – a civil rights advocacy organization of legal professionals and volunteers who defend citizens’ civil liberties – in May to recruit members and develop a chapter constitution this semester before registering as a student organization in the spring. Members said the chapter will tackle civil rights issues that affect students, like the threat against reproductive rights after the reversal of Roe v. Wade, which inspired their interest to join ACLU-GW and increase advocacy on campus.
Senior Gabriella Lehrman, ACLU-GW’s founder and co-president, said the group is planning to organize social events, like a ticketed movie night, to fund their organization. She said the group anticipates a fall semester of planning and a spring semester of programming, including reproductive rights protests around D.C. and speaker events with local experts and policymakers addressing topics within “ACLU’s focus area,” like voting rights, reproductive rights and criminal law reform.
“I’m just hoping that we can have a group of people with similar interests who just feel really comfortable to be able to get involved in D.C. and on campus and just feel like whatever they want to happen can happen, that there’s a space for them,” Lehrman said. “Since I’m a senior, freshman year I didn’t have a ton of people to go to protests with.”
Lehrman said the chapter will distill the national ACLU priorities, including criminal justice reform and reproductive rights protections, into a GW charter that creates a space for students to push for civil liberties. She said members plan to hold ACLU’s Know Your Rights training, which addressed common civil rights violations through instructional pamphlets and videos showing real-life scenarios, and criminal law reform training to get members acclimated with the chapter’s values and goals.
“I think the perfect part about the ACLU is that we are able to focus on national-level issues, D.C.-level issues and also campus-related issues,” Lehrman said. 
Lehrman said the D.C. chapter of the ACLU has worked to build more student-led chapters in the city through outreach to students and monthly meetings to discuss funding and training for civil rights-related action. 
“They definitely have a plan of what they want this to look like,” Lehrman said. “And obviously they are kind of the professional on the trainings.”
Lehrman said before she and her co-president graduate, they are looking for freshmen and sophomores to maintain the organization in future years and assume leadership roles, like programming chair and secretary. She said she is open to collaborating with Georgetown University’s ACLU chapter and plans on reaching out once ACLU-GW is an established organization.
Lehrman said the versatility of the topics covered within the chapter, like privacy and technology and voting rights, provides students with a diversity of advocacy opportunities. She said members hope to address “on-campus issues” later in the school year.
“I’m hoping that maybe if people don’t feel like there’s other clubs addressing a really specific issue that they’re interested in, that we are kind of known to be a very inclusive org that deals with so many issues that kind of everyone is affected by and everyone feels involved with,” she said. 
Shira Silberman, a junior and the co-founder of ACLU-GW, said the new chapter will act as a “branch” of ACLU and aim to recruit new members, especially freshmen, through social media accounts. 
Silberman said she hopes the chapter can unite members around issues they care about. She said most of the chapter’s members are women so far, so abortion and reproductive rights are some of the most major focuses for future programming.
“We’re hoping to build a strong foundation, especially now in the time when there’s a lot of attacks, especially on women’s rights and minority rights,” Silberman said. 
Ava Hadland, a sophomore studying international affairs, said she joined the chapter because it creates a community of like-minded students working to solve a multitude of pressing issues they face, like women’s rights.
“I kind of liked that there were so many different pathways, personal liberties-wise, not super politically focused but rather in terms of freedoms,” Hadland said. 
Hadland said she hopes the organization will help students reframe issues beyond partisan debates and instead focus on acknowledging certain topics as matters of “human rights or human liberties.”
She said the quick reversal of Roe v. Wade, despite the decades of reproduction rights legal protection, forced her to become more aware of prospective decisions that the Supreme Court made.
“It’s not only important to argue for what we believe in, in general, but creating an argument that is highlighting these issues and how they’re affecting everyone,” Hadland said.
Nichele Casse, a sophomore studying political science, said she joined ACLU-GW to defend civil liberties for the student body and learn more about her dream job, which is to be an attorney for the ACLU.
Casse said she is excited to explore topics like LGBTQ+ rights and criminal justice reform with ACLU-GW. She said the 2016 presidential election and the overturn of Roe v. Wade were events that “reinvigorated” her efforts to become politically involved. She said she is hoping that the organization will offer new opportunities like court watching – the act of observing court cases for educational purposes – which she said would not have been as “accessible” if it weren’t for ACLU-GW. 
“If there’s one thing about a student here at this school, it’s always the fact that they’ve probably got a protest sign ready,” she said.

Schenck said the program’s master of law and master of studies in law degrees are both available virtually, so students who work full-time or don’t live in D.C. can have equitable access to the program.
GW Law will roll out three courses later this academic year as part of an ongoing expansion of a law program providing professionals with expertise in cyber and national security law through new courses and virtual degree options.
Lisa Schenck, who was named the inaugural associate dean of the National Security, Cybersecurity and Foreign Relations Law Program last fall, said officials will roll out the Professional Responsibility and Ethics class this spring, while the Global Privacy Law and Conflict Seminar and Cybersecurity: Risk Management and Incident Response courses are up for approval next semester. She said officials expanded the program through nearly 20 new courses, a master of law degree and a master of studies in law degree, which in recent years have educated professionals on the intersection of cyber and national security law.
Marking a significant increase in courses, Schenck said the program now includes nearly 60 courses on “cutting-edge issues” in national security law, like artificial intelligence, compared to 2018 when the law school’s national security and cybersecurity specialization only offered 12 courses.
“GW Law has expanded its curricular focus to ensure our courses address both critical government infrastructure cybersecurity as well as data privacy and personal data cybersecurity concerns,” Schenck said in an email.
Schenck said the program’s master of law degrees allow lawyers to gain expertise in the “highly marketable” fields of cybersecurity or foreign relations law, like information privacy and counterintelligence. She said the program’s master of studies in law degrees cater to people who did not attend law school and do not want to become lawyers but have careers that would benefit from expertise in data security.
The program’s master of studies in law degree is part of the law school’s general master of studies in law program, which launched in fall 2018.
“With their MSL and LL.M. degrees, they learn how to protect critical government infrastructure and data through well-drafted government policies and regulatory standards,” she said.
Schenck said the program’s national security and cybersecurity master of law and master of studies in law degrees are both available virtually, so students who work full-time or don’t live in D.C. can still access the program.
She said law school officials expanded the program to include courses that address how cybersecurity issues impact both government infrastructure and everyday people, like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act course that educates students on the issues of balancing national security interests and the privacy rights of U.S. citizens.
“Growing vulnerabilities from physical and cyber threats and the world’s increased connectivity through the use of modern technology and cyberspace have created the need for expanded study into cybersecurity law and regulation that protects our critical cyber infrastructure,” she said.
Lindsay Rodman, a visiting associate professor of law and a fellow with the National Security, Cybersecurity and Foreign Relations Law Program, said law school officials expanded the program over the past four years in response to the rise in the number of professionals who are “clamoring” for programs that can advance their legal literacy.
“There’s just been a real growth among professionals, in particular, trying to better themselves, improve their credentials, come back to academia and benefit from the knowledge that’s being produced within the institution,” she said.
Rodman said the program’s location in D.C. provides students with connections to alumni from the law school and adjunct faculty members who are deeply involved in national security-related work.
“The adjunct faculty are the people who are doing this work day in and day out, and then they come and teach GW Law students what today’s issues are,” she said. “Not some academic notion of what today’s issues might be, but what they are actually facing on a day-to-day basis.”
She said the law school’s local connections to national security professionals enabled the success of its national security law programs after 9/11 catalyzed the expansion of the field during the past 20 years.
Rodman said legal professionals would benefit from more education on national security issues and the legal strategies used to combat them. She said many current national security issues – like foreign cyber attacks – are “novel” because they are constantly evolving.
“Lawyers historically have made the law more complicated in order to maintain our monopoly on the ability to practice law and understand it, and that doesn’t actually serve us, the public, other people, very well,” she said. “Better legal literacy across the country and practitioners in every field is better for everyone.”
Michael Bailey, the chair of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at The Georgia Institute of Technology, said the law school’s expansion of the program will help the law “catch up” to developments in modern technology in the past 20 years, like the growth of the internet, and the cybersecurity-related issues they created.
“If you’re going to engage in any transformative change as the kind of change that we see in technology now in our everyday society, the law profession is going to have to change alongside of it,” he said.
Bailey said legal professionals should create more regulations to govern individuals and people and companies’ access to private information as a way to adapt the law to address issues of cybersecurity.
“We live in a world where the privacy of your information, your street address, your credit card information, things that might be stolen, but also simply your location can have incredibly profound effects on your day-to-day life,” he said.

The Colonials logged their fourth tie of the season, struggling to execute on offense at the top of the box deeper into the opposing defense.
Women’s soccer tied with George Mason University in their Atlantic 10 opener Thursday afternoon in GW’s seventh game without a loss through the regular season.
Reaching their longest undefeated streak since 2019, the Colonials (3-0-5) hung on against the Patriots (1-5-3) in a 1–1 shootout on their home turf at the Mount Vernon Campus field. The Colonials started with a slow offense but gained momentum during the second half when they scored the first goal of the match before its otherwise-lockdown defense let in a game-tying George Mason goal in the second half.
The NCAA issued new guidelines this season, which eliminates overtime during the regular season, leading to more ties when the score remains even as time expires. The new set of rules has benefitted the GW team in the loss column compared to last season when the Colonials dropped 12 games through the regular season.
Freshman athletes like goalkeeper Grace Crowe have anchored the team’s defense to keep opponents to no more than two goals per game. The Colonials continue to work on creating new scoring opportunities after struggling to penetrate their opponent’s defense with consistency.
The Colonials shot at a .083 clip with 10 shots on goal while the Patriots averaged a .125 shooting percentage with three shots on goal. The Colonials sought to undermine the open Patriots defense but struggled to effectively weave their attacking play into the net.
Two minutes into the game, the Patriots took possession from a GW corner kick from the Colonials and George Mason junior forward Shea Carroll fired an unsuccessful shot out from the top left.
The Colonials responded with a kick from graduate student forward Rachel Sorkenn from the bottom right that George Mason freshman goalkeeper Selamawit Caldart saved. Sorkenn regained possession and worked the ball up from bottom center, shooting but failing to put it past Caldart.
Patriots junior forward Ashley Shimberg subbed into the game and applied extra pressure to the GW defense, opening up the zone to set up freshman midfielder Mia Casciani for a shot from the bottom right. GW freshman goalkeeper Grace Crowe ate up the shot for a save.
The Colonials encountered two more scoring opportunities as back-and-forth exchanges continued – junior defender Margaret Rabbitt and sophomore midfielder Abby Mansoor shot from the top, but two saves from George Mason’s Caldart stymied the attacks.
The second half began with a corner kick from the Colonials that punctured the George Mason defense and pushed GW into their zone.
In the 47th minute, GW’s Rabbitt scored off a corner for her second goal of the season coming off an assist from graduate student midfielder Sammy Neyman. The first goal of the game set the score at 1–0.
The Colonials sought to increase their attacks with three shots on goal, but Caldart snatched each attempt to hold the GW lead to just one.
The Patriots substituted in freshman forward Sophie Davidson during the 59th minute, who served to be the deciding factor for George Mason in the game. Within less than a minute of entering play, she broke through with a left foot kick that entered the net to tie the game.
The two teams totaled 11 fouls together during the second half, frustrating both offenses with box penalties that egged on the scoring drought.
The Colonials logged their fourth tie of the season, struggling to execute on offense at the top of the box deeper into the opposing defense.
The Colonials will travel to Fordham, where they will continue their A-10 slate. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. and will be available to watch on ESPN+.
