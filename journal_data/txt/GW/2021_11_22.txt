LeBlanc's statement comes after about 50 students protested administrators in Kogan Plaza and in front of LeBlanc's on-campus residence Friday in response to the complaint.
University President Thomas LeBlanc pronounced support for Palestinian students Monday, saying officials are investigating claims detailed in a human rights complaint filed against the University earlier this month.
Palestine Legal, a Palestinian rights advocacy group, sent the University a letter earlier this month alleging officials instructed the Office of Advocacy and Support to take down information about a “virtual processing space” for Palestinian students in June following violence in Gaza. In the statement, LeBlanc said officials are “committed” to preventing discrimination on campus and that GW is currently investigating the allegations, which were brought forth on behalf of an OAS employee.
“While this investigation is underway, the health and safety of members of our Palestinian community and all members of our University community remain our foremost priority,” LeBlanc said. “I recognize the concerns and frustrations some in the Palestinian community are feeling, and I want you to know that every member of our community deserves to feel welcome, supported, and included at GW.”
About 50 students protested administrators in Kogan Plaza and in front of LeBlanc’s on-campus residence Friday, calling on officials ​​to grant mental health services through OAS and demanding a response from LeBlanc.
LeBlanc did not say in the statement whether the University would address demands from the complaint, like allowing OAS to add an Arab or Middle East and North Africa category to the Multicultural Student Services Center webpage and holding a “#GWinSolidarity” event on anti-Palestinian bias and violence this academic year.
Leblanc said GW must act thoughtfully to ensure that its campus is inclusive to all during “difficult times.”
“I also want to make it clear that the University is committed to creating and maintaining a non-discriminatory environment and that University mental health programs and services are available to GW students, without regard to their national origin,” LeBlanc said.
LeBlanc said he encourages all community members who are seeking support to reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services, the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement, the Office of Advocacy and Support, the Division for Student Affairs, Human Resources or Faculty Affairs.
“We are committed to working every day to support the welcoming and inclusive community that we aspire to be, and I am grateful to all members of our community who are supporting one another and working toward that aspiration,” LeBlanc said.

The continued delays will last for the duration of the University's U-Pass trial period taking place next month.
Reduced Metrorail service will continue through Dec. 31, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Monday.
WMATA officials will make “incremental” service improvements through December as they wait for parts to arrive for older railcars. The continued delays will last for the duration of the University’s U-Pass trial period taking place next month.
The service delays follow a Blue Line train derailment last month, which led to safety concerns about Metro’s 7000-series fleet. Metro officials said there is “no timeline established” to return the railcars to service as they test new inspection protocols.
“This is a monumental undertaking that is being performed on parallel tracks to ensure that we have as little down time as possible between testing and remobilizing the fleet,” Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld said in a release. “We are intentionally not setting deadlines so that safety and good data drive our decisions, but we are mindful that customers want the best service we can provide as soon as we can deliver it, and we are committed to building back up in phases.”
Metro said officials are working to put older trains in service to decrease wait times, but 6000-series railcars are awaiting parts due to global supply chain challenges.
“As we get more parts, we will return more of the 6000-series railcars to service for our customers during December,” Wiedefeld said. “While we know service is not as frequent as customers would prefer, we will add each train as it becomes available to help incrementally improve service reliability and frequency.”

On Tuesday, Nov. 9th, students filled the Smith Center’s 5,000 seats for the men’s basketball home opener, cheering on and supporting the team to a narrow win against Saint Francis.
But another victory took place that night, one which all students should be proud of – we came together as a University to voice school spirit, show pride and form a community.
As a student body, sports afford us a unique opportunity to reap the experiential benefits of a pre-pandemic era. They bring us together in one common space for one common purpose: supporting GW’s sports teams. In turn, they foster an inclusive community that every student can enjoy, and we should therefore continue to bring our civic engagement to GW’s sports programs.
GW’s urban layout not only results in a lack of school spirit but also a lack of community. The city voids us of certain communal spaces, like dining halls, and beyond our residence halls there isn’t a place for students to gather in one home court. Instead, GW encourages students to leave campus and explore the city, as seen in its “101 Things To Do Checklist.” Of course, exploring D.C. is an integral component to the GW experience, but the unfortunate product of our urban environment is a physical campus with little school spirit and community.
Rather, GW’s city environment naturally attracts individualistic people. Students are focused on pursuing their unique goals in the form of activism or internships, which leads to much smaller communities at the University that are inclusive for some but alienating for others. GW is home to a sprawling political community, for example, but not all students are interested in politics. Many students join professional, career related organizations, but not all students know what they want to pursue after college. In plain terms, GW’s niche culture can be uninviting.
Sports, on the other hand, are a place for us to put our aspirations aside and our collective appreciation for GW at the forefront. Our Division 1 programs are a medium through which every student can show school spirit, regardless of personal opinions, political affiliations, career goals or even interest in the game itself. The manifestation of this is an inclusive community that anyone can join.
But students don’t come to this University because they want community. Instead, it’s the individualistic culture and professional opportunities that attract students to GW. And while it’s difficult for the University to establish a community, it does encourage and promote personal goals. After all, GW was ranked by the Princeton Review as the No. 1 college for internships in 2016. Furthermore, whether it’s budgeting GWorld or navigating the Metro, a city culture helps foster adulthood more so than a traditional campus environment.
Of course, we should not neglect these benefits and goals. They are the appeal of coming to college in the nation’s capital. And school spirit isn’t the only mechanism by which sports create community on campus either. Investing in our teams and players also allows us to return to a pre-pandemic era of tailgates and large in-person events. With virtual exams and mask mandates, we are still feeling the lingering effects of COVID-19. Sports can help remediate these effects, providing a public space where students can all congregate in person. They can help bridge the gap between the pre-coronavirus era and what we’re experiencing now. Engaging with sports is a way for us to recognize a more traditional college experience and this is something we as students should take advantage of.
And even those who dislike sports can participate in the environment they provide. In attending this school, we wanted to come to a place with like-minded individuals. Yet, in a culture as individualized as GW’s, it can be hard to find these people. Sports are a way to establish a community between students where the focus isn’t necessarily on the games themselves but instead on pride and spirit. These are feelings anyone can have in common.
GW has a passionate student body composed of individuals who are engaged in their surroundings, driven by their beliefs and motivated toward their futures. It is long overdue that we bring this passion and civic engagement to our sports programs. In doing so, we can forge a spirited community on campus that is open to everyone.

Many students are surely familiar with the agony of sitting in a classroom with a professor who is highly knowledgeable in their field of study, but is incapable of translating their industry jargon into language their students can grasp.
Professors have gained a wealth of expertise, often through decades of work in their specific fields to get to where they are in their careers, but they should understand that students aren’t equipped with the same career-specific vocabulary when they step into the classroom. I’m not arguing for a less rigorous curriculum or for administrative oversight in the classroom. Students should understand that they get from college what they put in, and faculty should have broad freedom to teach how they like. What I am arguing is that GW can make structural changes to its employment policy and to the class information provided by the registration process that will create greater harmony between professors and students in the classroom.
The quality of teaching at GW partially depends on the University’s tenure policy which forces professors to weigh their time spent teaching against that which they devote to research. As the Faculty Code makes clear, among the considerations for tenure include a commitment to the University’s standing as a “preeminent research university.” While GW states that excellence in teaching and service are “prerequisites” for tenure, it quickly clarifies that “they are not in themselves sufficient” unless a faculty member’s “scholarly accomplishments are considered excellent” when compared to their colleagues at other institutions.
The administrative motives behind this are fairly clear. Much of GW’s funding and prestige comes from investments in faculty who produce an abundance of research. But this justification alone, aimed at only one aspect of GW’s competitiveness, is narrow-minded and short-sighted. The primary social good of GW is not to churn out publications. It is to raise a generation of resilient, critical and caring adults who will become future leaders in their fields of work. This goal is deeply tied to the quality of teaching and precedes the good of research advancement for two reasons. First, because the impact of its success or failure on the culture of civil society is felt much sooner and more acutely. Second, perhaps more purely, because the quality of teaching determines the quality of research through its shaping of the students who are to become future researchers.

The classroom experience is foundational to the health of academia. If GW’s tenure boards understood this, perhaps they would raise the importance of excellence in teaching to be at least on par with scholarly production – and, in doing so, encourage professors to distinguish themselves pedagogically. Another step, perhaps more easily taken, would be to increase the number and prestige of teaching awards. In 2021, GW’s three major awards for teaching, the Amsterdam, Bender and Trachtenberg prizes, offered $500, $1,000 and $1,500 respectively to a combined total of ten professors. In sum, if we want people to bet on better teaching, I suggest we sweeten the pot.
The path to better teaching also involves students. In part, this means giving students the tools to match their learning styles to professors’ teaching styles. Many of my peers would agree that no matter the class, a professor’s teaching style can make or break that hour of your day and even entirely change your opinion on a field of study for better or worse. When students are registering for classes, third-party resources like Rate My Professor, are inconveniently decentralized and biased from small sample sizes of student reviews. GW can address this by asking professors to provide general information about their teaching style for a particular course and then embedding that information into the course option as it appears on the schedule of classes.
That said, a degree of mystery surrounding how a class will be taught should be preserved. We must not have a university where professors, to preserve their enrollments, are forced to monitor their reputations and restructure their classes to appease a tyrannical majority of students. And we must have a university where students may benefit from the true spirit of a liberal arts education: growth, via removal from their comfort zone.
Students can also do their part in encouraging administrators to prioritize teaching as a standard for faculty excellence. The main obstacle to focusing on teaching skill as a cause for promotion is that it’s naturally harder to measure than scholarly production. Much of the data on teaching comes from students. If students want their professors to teach better, they should fill out their course evaluations and do them well – concretely praising the excellent teachers and constructively critiquing the rest. Professors, for their part, can designate class time for filling out evaluations, offer extra credit for it and, above all, actually read them. It’s also useful for professors to create opportunities for anonymous feedback during a class so that students may have a say in their current classroom experience.
There is a big caveat here. When evaluating teaching effectiveness administrators must not rely on a single kind of assessment. Studies have shown that student evaluations in particular are rife with bias. Students tend to rate professors higher when a class is easy and grading is lenient, which in turn pushes professors away from rigor and toward grade inflation. Alarming patterns in student ratings also emerge along criteria irrelevant to teaching, such as the professor’s race, gender or physical attractiveness. If administrators wish to elevate teaching as a cause for promotion, they must seek a holistic process of assessing teaching ability. The sharpness of student ratings can be rounded out by considering teaching awards, peer reviews of course materials, peer classroom observation and student exit interviews. Measuring learning outcomes may also help, but this may only be easy to accomplish in STEM fields where students’ coursework more continuously moves from one level to the next. Overall, the more robust and reliable this data is, the more justification tenure boards will have to reward professors for their pedagogy, which brings us full circle.
Underlying all these economic arguments is an ideal that speaks to the heart. One of the most joyful experiences for a professor should be channelling their knowledge into a story grand enough to shatter a student’s world and build it anew. And as a student, I can say there is nothing more worthy of a true education than such an experience.

Students’ free trial of U-Pass will begin on Dec. 1 and last through the end of finals. 
Students can pick up their cards to participate in the December free trial for U-Pass the week after returning from Thanksgiving break, the University announced in an email to students Friday.
Officials said they will distribute the cards from the Continental Ballroom on the third floor of the University Student Center throughout the week after Thanksgiving, and representatives from GW and Metro will be on-site to answer students’ questions. The email states students will have to present their GWorld to pick up the U-Pass card, which can’t be connected to personal SmarTrip cards, and students will also have to pick up a new permanent U-Pass card for the spring when the University starts charging $100 per semester for the program.
The email states officials will announce pick-up dates and times for spring 2022 U-Pass cards by mid-December.
“To participate in GW’s U-Pass program you will need to show your student GWorld card and pick up a physical U-Pass Metro SmartTrip Card,” the email reads. “Even if you have your own personal SmartTrip Card, you will need a separate unique card for this program.”
Students can pick up their cards Monday, Nov. 29 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and pickup times start at 9 a.m. throughout the rest of the week, according to the email. Distribution closes at 6 p.m. Tuesday, 3 p.m. Wednesday and noon Thursday and Friday, the email states.
Officials announced earlier this month that the University will participate in a “free trial” of U-Pass to offer students unlimited rides on Metrorail and Metrobus starting Dec. 1 through the end of final exams before tacking $100 in student fees each semester. Students will receive a “specially-designed” Metro card featuring GW’s logo over the school’s monogram, according to a release WMATA issued Friday.

Nearly 175 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine have been administered nationwide.
GW is continuing to participate in Moderna’s trial of its COVID-19 vaccine, contributing data that led up to federal regulators’ approval of a booster shot for all adults this past week.
The University launched coronavirus vaccine centers last August to begin the two-year study, which Moderna dubbed “SpikeVax,” garnering a diverse group of 350 volunteers who monitored their symptoms after taking either a placebo or the vaccine. David Diemert, a professor of medicine and the principal investigator for the trial at the GW site, said researchers began administering booster shots at the end of September after finding the two-dose regimen to be safe and highly effective.
“The data already has been turned into something exceedingly valuable to all people – an extremely effective vaccine that has already contributed immensely to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world,” Diemert said in an email. “The participants in the study at GW have been critical players in this. Without them, we would not have been able to get to the point where SpikeVax has been authorized or approved by multiple countries around the world.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed Moderna and Pfizer’s coronavirus booster shots for all adults Friday, widening booster eligibility after previously approving the shots for individuals at higher risk. Nearly 175 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine have been administered nationwide, according to the CDC.
Diemert said he and the 30-member team expect to finish administering the booster doses by the first week of December. Participants complete study visits four weeks and six months after receiving their boosters for researchers to collect antibody and safety data, he said.
The effort is a collaboration between the wings of GW’s medical enterprise – the School of Medicine and Health Sciences recruited participants, the Medical Faculty Associates assesses participants’ symptoms and the Milken Institute School of Public Health contributes data and fiscal management, Diemert said.
He said more than 50 percent of GW’s participants are people of color, and researchers have retained more than 90 percent of the initial group. A few volunteers withdrew last December to learn whether they had received the placebo and could subsequently receive the Pfizer vaccine, and some withdrew near the start of the semester to receive a booster dose before it had been added to the trial, he said.
“Overall, though, we’ve had good retention of participants in the study,” Diemert said.
Diemert said the team will follow the participants through phone calls for 25 months after their enrollment. He said researchers will see the last participant for their final check-up in January 2023.
“The overall goal is to conduct the Phase 3 trial according to the highest ethical and clinical standards, which means primarily to protect the safety and rights of our study participants, but also to ensure that the data being collected is rigorous, reliable and complete,” Diemert said.
Medical and public health experts said logistical aspects of the Phase 3 trial, like patient check-ins and constant data collection, make the study difficult for participants and clinicians but will confirm the effectiveness of the SpikeVax vaccine.
Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine and population and public health sciences at the University of Southern California, said although trials can be frustrating for patients who must regularly travel to clinics and wait for results and reimbursement, many participants enjoy “contributing to help others.”
“The biggest challenge is keeping people in the trial for follow-up over a long time,” Klausner said in an email. “Many people become tired of coming back for visits and evaluations.”
James Dingam, a professor of public health sciences at the University of Chicago, said after the Phase 3 trial ends, he predicts that the Food and Drug Administration will conduct a follow-up study of participants who received the vaccine to monitor its efficacy in the longer term.
“I think that there will be requirements from the FDA with full approval that they do this sort of phase four follow up, but not a lot is expected out of that, any real negative things, but they probably still be required to do it,” Dignam said.
Dignam said recruiting participants who are representative of the general population based on race, gender, ethnicity and even location is critical to make sure the vaccine is safe for everyone.
“It’s actually something that’s required to at least report on the demographics and if possible explore whether there’s a differential benefit or risk based on those kind of groupings,” he said.
Paul Beninger, a professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University, said logistics can be a challenge for many trials, both on the clinical side with recruiting volunteers and on the patients’ side with randomized assignments for treatment. He said researchers need a sophisticated “infrastructure of computers” and knowledgeable clinicians to monitor the patients.
Beninger said although vaccine approval and distribution occurred much faster than for most vaccines, which can take five to 10 years, that should not affect the safety of the vaccine.
“Because it’s a pandemic, we’re trying to vaccinate a huge number of people, so we’ve again telescoped everything into a really short period of time,” Beninger said. “And if anything was going to happen, it would have happened well within 100 million people.”

The building has been under construction since 2019 and is expected to be completed early next year. 
Construction work at 2100 Pennsylvania Ave. is close to wrapping up, but as the site passes its second year of hammering and drilling, students said they’re hoping for an accelerated finish to the project.
GW signed a nearly $200 million, 75-year lease with Boston Properties in 2019 to develop the site into a glass office complex with stores and restaurants, now slated to open as soon as this summer. But more than half a dozen students living in Lafayette Hall and District House say early-morning construction noises – which they say start as early as 5 a.m. – from the nearby site have disrupted their sleep schedules.
Sean Sullivan, the vice president for development at Boston Properties, said the company is not aware of any noise complaints from residents. He said company officials are in “close contact” with the University and are cooperating to confirm that construction is ongoing within permitted hours if complaints do arise.
“We work with our general contractor to ensure the construction activities stay within the noise levels and hours permitted by the city,” he said in an email. “The activities on our site are typical for a downtown construction project of this size.”
Sullivan said slower government utility inspections and construction material delivery delays caused minor setbacks to the project, but the completion timeline is still in line with the original projection of the first quarter of 2022.
“We have experienced some material delivery delays related to the ongoing disruption to the global supply chain, but we have overall fared better than some other projects in the region,” he said. “We did experience some delays early on in the project related to inspections from government agencies (they stopped visiting sites or reduced staff) but that process is now thankfully back to normal.”
Law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP signed a deal in 2017 agreeing to house its headquarters in the new building, which will account for about half of its square footage. Sullivan said they are aiming for “substantial completion” of the building in March or April, and locals may see stores and restaurants in the complex opening as soon as next summer.
“We are excited to be delivering 2100 Penn in the very near future and look forward to announcing new retail offerings for the surrounding neighborhood,” he said.
The building has been under construction since 2019, when Lafayette Hall residents initially lamented over disruptions to their sleep.
Students complained about construction noise coming from 2100 Penn disrupting their sleep and interfering with their class work throughout this semester.
Much of the building’s construction coincided with the pandemic, and Boston Properties obtained late-night work permits through last July in hopes of getting back on schedule while students were away from campus. But as students reoccupy nearby residence halls, they say the noise has remained a constant in the neighborhood.
Sophomore Maria Fugel, a fourth-floor District House resident, said morning construction noises can awake her as early as 5 a.m. as the clamor continues throughout the day, leaving her unable to fall back to sleep.
“It wakes me up on nights where I have a test or something important to do the next day, and that impacts my performance,” Fugel said.
Sophomore Dylan Lyman, who lives on the eighth floor of District, said he has awoken multiple times throughout the semester to the sound of work outside of the building.
“Construction noises, trucks and loud machinery usually wake me up an hour or two before I plan on waking up in the morning,” Lyman said. “It usually wakes me up around 8-ish or a little bit after.”
Sophomore Chris Cho, who lives on the fourth floor of District, said he has noticed intermittent periods of loud machinery and other construction-related noises.
“Hammering and machinery is super loud at random times throughout the day,” Cho said. “The District group chat every week or so complains about random hammering throughout the day or night.”
Some residents of Lafayette Hall, which is closer to the construction site, echoed the same concerns about construction noise, which interferes with their studies and early morning sleep. Freshman Penda Hott, who lives in Lafayette, said the noise has become excessive for her and her roommate.
“On a scale of one to 10, it’s 12,” Hott said. “It was awful. You could hear literally everything.”
Hott said she normally hears the construction start at around 7 a.m., which wakes her and her roommate up and makes it difficult to return to sleep.
“It felt like it was right there in front of our window – it’s like very early in the morning,” she said. “It’s every day.”

Roughly 18 percent of adults remain unvaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
With Thanksgiving less than a week away, many students are confronted with the challenge of navigating the holidays with unvaccinated friends and family.
From managing disagreements about vaccines to mitigating the risks of contact with unvaccinated family and friends, there’s a lot to think about if you’re going to traverse the holidays with unvaccinated family members unscathed. We spoke with experts in psychology and epidemiology on tactics to navigate the holiday with loved ones who may not see eye to eye on COVID-19 vaccines.
Here’s what they said:
Gather in a well-ventilated space
The commonly known risks of any gatherings with unvaccinated people are the transmission of the virus between unvaccinated guests or the rare possibility of a breakthrough case. Yet, experts in epidemiology said there are several ways to reduce these risks, including coronavirus testing and physical distancing.
Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said small indoor gatherings with proper ventilation are “fairly safe.” He said hosts should ensure that their gatherings are well ventilated and have space for distancing if they are expecting unvaccinated guests.
“If you’re fully vaccinated, with some precautions like good ventilation, these are likely to be safer than all the other settings most students will encounter, like stores, transportation and many indoor places,” Morse said in an email.
Avoid contact or insist on testing
George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at University of California at San Francisco, said the easiest way to protect yourself from the risks of contact with an unvaccinated friend or family member is to avoid them. He said if staying away from an unvaccinated person is not an option, coronavirus testing, choosing an outdoor setting and not mixing households are other possible methods of reducing risks.
“Avoidism is a really important public health measure,” Rutherford said. “If you’re not going to uninvite them, you just make sure they get tested the morning of.”
Set realistic expectations for social interactions with family
Geoffrey Greif, a professor of social work at the University of Maryland, said there are several mental health benefits of social contact that lead to “longer, happier, healthier lives.”
As students experience in-person holiday celebrations for the first time in two years, he said they should manage their expectations about the holidays.
“The challenge for students and everyone is to lower expectations about what is going to happen,” Greif said. “You can’t cram in the last 18 months or 20 months that people may have missed into one vacation.”
Break up large gatherings into several small get-togethers
Mary McNaughton-Cassill, a professor of psychology at University of Texas at San Antonio, said holidays are important to “remember our past” and “cement our culture,” but traditions can change and be updated for the pandemic.
“Maybe we don’t have a giant family gathering, but different groups of people get together in smaller pieces,” McNaughton-Cassill said. “You could have dinner with the family that’s vaccinated and do something virtual with the ones that aren’t. It’s about thinking outside the box.”
Don’t spar with unvaccinated family members
Maureen O’Reilly-Landry, a clinical psychologist and a founding member of the COVID Psychology Task Force, said students should be understanding of the reasons why family members may choose not to get vaccinated.
She said past experiences with the medical profession and political values are examples of factors that influence one’s willingness to be vaccinated.
“People have their own individual reasons for it,” O’Reilly-Landry said. “It’s not just delusional people getting weird information from the internet.”
She said students should not try to lecture their unvaccinated family members or friends because this may seem condescending and may cause them to “shut down” or respond with hostility.
“Listen and try to understand and let them talk about what their concerns are,” O’Reilly-Landry said. “That might help you to address what their real concern is.”
Have the hard conversations gently and with research to back you up
Asha Shajahan, the medical director of Health Equity and Disparity for Beaumont Health in Michigan, said students should approach conversations with their unvaccinated friends and family with “the three C’s”: compassion, connection and collaboration.
“The biggest thing is people just tell people to get vaccinated and they kind of roll their eyes or they get upset when people don’t want to get vaccinated,” she said. “And instead, if we approach it with a lot more compassion and listening, then it’s going to bring the guard down of the other person and then you’re able to have more of a conversation.”
She said nongovernmental sources, such as universities or hospitals, may be more effective at convincing unvaccinated individuals than governmental sources because unvaccinated individuals may be distrustful of the government.
“I always ask people who are unvaccinated, ‘Would you be okay if I shared with you some of my resources,’” Shajahan said. “If they say ‘Yes, sure,’ then you can sit and navigate each of their sources.”

At the same time as GW is emerging from a disruptive global pandemic, the institution also approaching a post-LeBlanc era. After incoming interim University President Mark Wrighton’s up-to-18-month tenure is complete, a new chief administrator will have the opportunity to move GW forward in a new strategic direction that will benefit the entire GW community.
But in the meantime, GW is adrift. As higher education emerges from the COVID-19 era, a rudderless GW risks being left behind. GW needs a long-term plan that will make the University a place where everyone can thrive and feel welcome. Even in the absence of a strategic plan for the institution, making good on pledges to bolster shared governance and involve the whole GW community in picking the new president will put the University in a strong position to succeed.
Officials periodically draft a strategic plan that is intended to set a unified direction for the University. From facilities to academics, every aspect of GW factors into strategic planning. Any long-term goals the University hopes to achieve are laid out in the plan, and changes large and small flow from it. Officials were working on a plan when the pandemic hit, placing it on hold as operations moved online.
Since then, there has been zero motion on a strategic plan. For a University that has experienced a crisis of confidence in its leadership over the past few years, this is somewhat concerning. The entire GW community has been crying out for a new direction – whether it’s shared governance, divestment or balancing GW’s focus on STEM versus the humanities.
GW needs a new strategic plan. But first, it needs a new president. Wrighton’s years of experience as a college chief administrator make him well-positioned to guide GW through the immediate post-pandemic and post-LeBlanc period. But his role is as a caretaker. His task is to come in and steer the University through some of the more acute problems it faces, like layoffs and returning to pre-pandemic operations. But deciding on a new direction for GW should be left to a permanent president whose tenure will last longer than 18 months and who is chosen through a full and open process.
In one of our previous staff editorials, we laid out several goals that Wrighton should prioritize to put the next University president and the GW community as a whole in the best position to prosper after his departure. Most importantly on that list of goals, the Board of Trustees must act on their promises of shared governance and inclusivity as they pick the next University president.
LeBlanc’s last full strategic planning effort included the 20/30 Plan, which would have increased undergraduate enrollment in STEM disciplines and decreased humanities enrollment. The plan was a severe miscalculation in more ways than one. Non-STEM faculty members raised concerns about funding cuts in their own departments, and the Faculty Senate declared that the plan violated established shared governance principles.
The 20/30 Plan was rendered obsolete in light of the pandemic. But if it had taken effect, the plan was projected to reduce diversity levels in the undergraduate population while also decreasing the University’s net revenue. Needless to say, the plan was ill-advised, unapproved by the GW community and would have harmed both the undergraduate students and the University itself. The plan was also informed by a larger administrative culture of disregarding the University’s academic culture and ignoring the wishes of students and faculty.
Clearly, the problem with the previous strategic plan stemmed from the administration that authored it. GW’s next permanent president should be chosen via a process that solicits and internalizes meaningful input from all corners of the University. It is much more likely that someone chosen by that kind of process and steeped in the values of shared governance and diversity will point the direction in the kind of strategic direction that will benefit the entire community.
In the meantime, the outgoing LeBlanc administration and incoming Wrighton administration can lay the foundation for their permanent successor to succeed. They should continue to look after GW’s humanities departments and ensure that the University is affordable and racially diverse. Trustees must begin to create this new culture of shared governance and inclusivity by incorporating the community into the search process for a new president.
The University has an opportunity to move in a more inclusive and unified direction in a way that benefits every member and every level of the community – from individual students to staff to professors. The first step on that journey is to get the presidential search process right. The strategic plan GW needs will follow naturally from there.
