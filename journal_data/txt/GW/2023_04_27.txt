Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
I came into GW without a defined direction or any idea of where I wanted to dedicate my time on campus. But the one card I had to play was an open mind. Hungry to find my place, I tried out political organizations, theater groups, fine arts and seemingly everything else under the sun. While those endeavors gave me some wonderful memories and valuable skills, none of them fit quite right. When they didn’t work out, the organization I least expected to stick was The Hatchet.
For many students who have found interest in writing for The Hatchet, the paper can at first feel like a daunting, impenetrable institution for only the few willing to dedicate hours upon hours to chase down a story each day. As a freshman completely unsure of what I wanted to major in or do with the rest of my life who didn’t know the first rule of journalism, those barriers seemed even harder to break through.
Entering as an inexperienced writer with no bylines or journalism classes to my name, I nervously climbed the steps of the illustrious Hatchet townhouse to my first student life section meeting not knowing what to expect. I gradually eased into reporting for the student life and culture sections with the help of my editors, and while my stories were riddled with edits, I never got discouraged.
When the pandemic began, the shutdown allowed me to really throw myself into the paper. I took on a story or two weekly to fill up my time and with this practice, really began to learn. While writing stories about everything – from students struggling with COVID while taking online classes to psychedelic legislation in D.C. to food reviews – I moved from reporter to staff writer to contributing culture editor by April 2021. I couldn’t help but leap at the chance to sink my teeth into any story that came along.

Transitioning into culture editor was a dream come true for me, and with the help of amazing friends and colleagues, I could make my dreams for the section come true. I had taken a grand total of one intro journalism class at GW, but the experience I gained at this paper made me feel more than ready to take on a section head position. As I advocated for impactful culture stories to make the front page and created two new subsections of culture alongside my team, the section saw a large shift this year in the exposure, variety and content we cover. And that all started four years ago, with a desperate email I sent to the editor in chief at the time, asking to join a section.
My love of writing stories on this paper was greater than the uphill battle I had to ascend when I came on. I felt a passion for reporting on GW and D.C. like I had never felt through any other outlet. And the community I worked with didn’t make me feel discouraged – they uplifted me and had more patience than I could’ve ever expected.
Author and journalist Mitch Albom wrote “love comes when you least expect it,” but I might tack on an addendum to his sentiment. Love comes both when – and where – you least expect it. The Hatchet was the most surprising place for me, but it was the perfect fit.
To everyone who contributes their incredible work to this paper…
Lily Speredelozzi | Assistant Photo Editor
Julia: My Hatchet soul sister and pop culture educator. You joined culture staff when we needed you most, and your addition to the team was beyond a blessing in disguise. Your advocacy and love for culture is so beautiful, and you helped make the section what it is today. The next time I need to learn more about Dianna Agron’s dating history or the unfair treatment of The Chicks, I know you’ll be more than happy to dish and hyper-analyze. You’re truly a firework.
Nora: You’ve been a superstar since day one, so I was elated to see you sign up for a contrib culture interview a year ago. You bring such a distinct voice to the paper with fresh perspectives and pitches that make the culture section better. I hope to read much more of your writing – both in and outside of the paper – in the future.
Lily: If someone on staff were a real life angel, I think it would be you. You’re not only the sweetest, you’re also such an amazing person to work with and offer so much support when I get tunnel vision, overrun with things to do. Your photos are my absolute favorites – and I could ask no one better to go on a 30s photoshoot excursion with me and Julia. I can’t wait to see what you do next year.
Jarrod: I couldn’t have asked for a better EIC this year – you were willing to take a chance with culture, and you’re a Cautious Clay fan (win-win). Your drive and willpower are unmatched, and you never let a stressful situation get in the way of compassion. While your pop culture knowledge might be a little slim, you’re a born leader, and I’m excited to read many more of your pieces in the future.
Zach: The most talented writer and editor I have the pleasure of knowing. From basketball coverage to culture reviews to breaking huge stories, this paper is so lucky to publish your limitless talent for writing. You’ve stepped up to the ultimate leadership position, and I could not be more confident in you. I’m beyond proud of you and can’t wait to see where your leadership takes this publication. Watching you write and edit day in and day out, you never shined so brightly, in your element working devotedly on a story.
Ethan: You’re such a pure Hatchet talent, and our paper is so lucky to have you. From your animated character voices you put on in Ed Board to your guidance on Ask Annie, your presence is always a delight. Can’t wait to read all of your next pieces to come!
Annie: After editing several of your drafts – some of the most unorthodox, engaging stories culture has seen in years – I knew you were a gem of The Hatchet. You found your perfect place(s) in the paper, and I’m very eager to listen to your culture podcast ventures in the new volume – perhaps one about knitting?
Michelle: My twin flame star baby and the most immaculate health and sciences editor. Even though you left GW to go a little “upstate,” your legacy at The Hatchet is unforgettable. You’re the most hardworking person I know, and I’m so happy for you in your new leadership role. No matter how many times you try to escape the chaotic world of journalism, it keeps beckoning you back in. Nevertheless, one of the best things this paper did was put us together and give us many obstacles to bond over. You’re going to do incredible things, and I can’t wait to have a front row seat to them all.
Nuria and Tara: You two are always down to take a culture story, even if it means hitting up five clubs on a Saturday night for research purposes. So excited to see all the amazing things you do in years to come.
Isha and Lauren: Culture’s top cheerleaders! You both have always had insane amounts of respect from me, producing such admirable work as news editors. Crossing paths with both of you is always a delight.
Anna Boone: The absolute greatest of all time! Writing stories for you and running culture with you last year was such an incredible learning experience. You set the bar and shaped the writer and editor I am today, and I am so appreciative of that. Thanks for being such a wonderful leader.
Nick Perkins: From an anecdote of a prominent Beach Boy saying “hi queen!” to the actual queen of England to rankings of jumbo slice pizza spots, your pieces are an absolute joy to edit. You’re such a fast learner and it’s been amazing to see you grow on this paper. I can’t wait to read more stellar feature stories from you and certainly more movie reviews!
Jenna: The minute you suggested Crumbs & Whiskers as the best spot to break up for our Best of Northwest guide, I knew you would come up with some of the best editorial ideas the culture section has ever seen. Your writing is always an absolute treat to read, and I’m so eager to see you bring more creativity and engagement to culture next volume. You’re a star asset to our team. Keep killing the game with your Ask Annie cartoons.
My family and friends: Your support in my fluctuating endeavors means the world to me. For all the times I couldn’t take a call or go out because of Hatchet work, I truly appreciate the extensive patience. I am the writer I am today because of you.

Facing a problem yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
Dear Annie,
I keep accidentally ghosting people. I don’t mean to – I just keep forgetting to respond. I went on two dates with this one girl, and I just forgot to text her back. I never meant to ghost her.
Help please,
Mike Kinsella
Dear Mike Kinsella,
Mr. Kinsella, lead vocalist and guitarist of the musical group “American Football,” it seems that Midwestern emo bands cannot catch a break! If you’re used to long Midwestern goodbyes, it may be hard to acknowledge “ghosting” is not the worst thing you could do.
Ghosting happens – especially as one gets busy with academics and extracurriculars. Don’t beat yourself up about stalled or stopped communication. Even a potential soulmate could easily slip away while talking over text. Perhaps you feared saying the wrong thing, had an all-consuming exam or simply forgot to respond without their physical presence.
Though you may not have intended to ghost this girl, let’s consider why you did. Maybe, at that moment in time, you weren’t that into her? It’s rare to neglect someone that you care about a lot. Or you may need consistent quality time with a person to motivate you to regularly respond to their messages. Take some time for introspection to consider if you’re actually interested in her.
Jenna Baer | Staff Cartoonist
If after further reflection you still want to slide back into her DMs, it is possible to reopen a line of communication with a lot of honesty and, perhaps, a planner.
To strike up communication with your unfinished business after falling off the face of the earth, you are going to have to send the first text. While it was never your intention, acknowledge how your neglect made her feel. Be vulnerable and share what prompted your behavior, whether District’s late-night fire alarms distracted you or you mentally replied but never sent an actual message. Though no reason will excuse your behavior, an explanation lets a ghosted girl know that ignoring her was unrelated to your interest in her.
When you text her a well-deserved apology, have a date idea in mind, like coffee or booking a study room in Gelman. If she responds favorably, you can quickly suggest an in-person activity, which shows your commitment to continuing to explore a relationship with her.
If she’s open to striking up a conversation again, you cannot fall off the face of the earth. Ghost the same girl once, shame on you. Ghost the same girl twice, she will feel like a fool – and you don’t want to be responsible for making her feel silly.
Consistency is key. Schedule time into your day to text her. Maybe every day at 5 p.m., you receive a reminder from your Google Calendar to text your possible paramour. When you text her, make a conscious effort to initiate in-person activities. Rather than engaging in a virtual conversation about her day, ask if she can grab dinner or go on a quick walk. The more you see each other in person, the less you have to worry about responding to texts.
Ghosting happens, whether we intend to disappear or not. With honesty, patience and effort to see each other in person, you can hopefully pick up where you left off. If you need any more help – my penitent phantom – I am always here. The best part of writing to an advice columnist? There’s no need for you to respond.
Don’t be a stranger,
Annie

As a freshman at GW, one of my closest friends at school is a 22-year-old junior from Mexico City who speaks a different first language than I do. Her name is Arantxa Gomez – she is a spring-semester exchange student from El Colegio de México and one of the best parts of my first year of college.
But she’s leaving D.C. at the end of the summer, and it might be months or even years before I see her in person again. All college friendships, particularly transnational ones, are on a ticking timer – separation is ever-looming. But reflecting back on this semester together, I would rather know Ara for five months and endure the painful goodbye than have never known her at all.
Fate has a funny way of forging friendships. Ara and I first met each other the first week back from winter break when I needed sincere friendships at GW in the same way that I need oxygen – to survive. She, a nervous exchange student, and I, an apprehensive freshman, found ourselves surrounded by too many people who didn’t truly know us and didn’t care to find out. I tearfully called my mom earlier that week, terrified that I wouldn’t be able to find where I belonged at GW and that it was already too late for me to start over again. Then I met Ara.
She approached me as I was sitting alone at the general body meeting for an on-campus acting club, the 14th Grade Players. She told me earlier this week I looked like I wouldn’t judge her, so at the end of the meeting, she unassumingly walked up to me, introduced herself as Ara – she didn’t think many native English speakers could pronounce “Arantxa” – and smiled. I hadn’t done a lot of smiling myself that week, but her genuine demeanor and compassionate expression broke through my defense shield. I liked her right away.
Ironically, neither of us had any interest in acting. Ara’s roommate had brought her along as a way to introduce her to more GW students while I was there because I forced myself to try one new thing a week that scared me to prove my internal strength to myself.
It turned out Ara and I were both political science students enrolled in the same Violence in Latin America lecture. She told me she was from Mexico and I lit up – I was a Spanish minor who spoke the language like a “gringa” eager to practice conversing in an organic way. She hadn’t met any other Spanish speakers at the time, so just the comfort of being able to express herself to someone who could understand her was an exciting prospect. We exchanged phone numbers, sat next to each other the next day in class and grabbed a coffee at For Five afterward.
Now, five months later, we talk every day. I am forever in awe of the power of “hello” and the potential that exists in every introduction. The resonance of friendship can be heard around the world.
Arantxa is a sunflower. She’s a Taylor Swift song on repeat. She’s my friend, and I have to watch her move 2,336 miles away from me in a few short months. I wish I could hide her in my closet or that I was small enough to fit in her carry-on luggage.
Through Arantxa, I’ve met other incredible international students, and now my days are spent speaking in a hodgepodge of English and Spanish with the occasional French quip. With every conversation I have with her, I feel myself becoming more and more confident in my bilingualism. Ara never mocks my lack of Spanish fluency – she uplifts my skills and even pretends to be impressed by my lackluster conversation abilities.
But both of us are gaining international experiences. I introduce her to my favorite coffee shops and restaurants in the District. She teaches me Mexican slang, and I help her perfect her California valley girl accent for those emergencies when she needs it. We swap stories, songs and worries that we’re afraid to even admit to ourselves.
In these pure, fleeting moments, there’s no room for formalities, small talk or embarrassment – that’s the greatest lesson these compressed college friendships have taught me. We have a mutual agreement to be the rawest versions of ourselves – we won’t remember our conversations about the weather, but we will remember walking home in a rainstorm after indulging in tacos, confessing our secrets to each other into the night. This is how I cope with the leaving – she may no longer be with me physically, but our mental scrapbook of memories will always be there.
Arantxa has taught me more than just Spanish – she’s taught me the universal language of friendship. I’ve learned the importance of words, the vulnerability of a hug, the light of a laugh and the joy of a smile. She is one of the smartest, kindest individuals I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. It’s surreal to me that by August, we won’t be living blocks away from each other. But distance will always surrender to the strongest friendships.
Ara and I are made to last, no matter what country we find ourselves in. Some might call it naivete, but I call it betting on the right people. Goodbye is just a placeholder until the next hello.

Director Greta Gerwig’s new “Barbie” movie comes out this July, and social media is buzzing with excitement about the promotional posters and trailer released this month. But beyond my enthusiasm surrounding Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling’s casting, the film’s unapologetic pink hues, glitter and “She’s everything” tagline brought back many childhood memories of growing up with Barbie. I realized the prominent positive influence Barbie had on me as a child followed me all the way into adulthood.
“You can be anything” is the slogan for Mattel’s Barbie dolls – the words I saw splattered on every Barbie commercial and toy box throughout my childhood. I remember looking in awe at Barbie’s wide-ranging occupations – a veterinarian, doctor, flight attendant, chef and astronaut – and asking my mom in disbelief if those were all actually Barbie’s careers because I had no idea those dreams were possible for young girls like me. Barbie taught me that no dream is too small or too big, and young girls’ aspirations are unlimited.
When I played with my dozens of Barbie dolls, they could do anything – they were everything I could not wait to be when I grew up. They each had a specific path laid out for them, from a Hollywood actress to a doctor to a stay-at-home mom and everything in between. My Barbies represented the various aspects of my personality, tastes and dreams. I always had one favorite Barbie that got to live all of my dreams, but as I grew older, a new Barbie would become the next representation of who I wanted to be. My earliest favorites were princesses, others were dancers or fashion designers and the most recent ones were writers or lawyers. But I never discarded any of my dolls – by the time it was time to close the box, they were not just dolls, but my own evolution as a person. And because of Barbie, I became unapologetic about who I was.
But each time adults asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, they gave me a look of disbelief or a comment about how difficult it would be. “I want to be president of the United States” was often followed by “It’s just a phase, you’ll grow out of it.”
And these rude comments were not just limited to my aspirations – they often disparaged anything considered “girly” or feminine. When I mentioned that my favorite color was pink or that I liked poofy dresses and bows, adults condescendingly told me I’d grow out of liking the color. My interests and tastes were belittled, and while it bothered me that I wasn’t taken seriously, it never occurred to me to change who I was. And that’s thanks to Barbie.
I never once felt embarrassed about what I wanted to do with my life or the things I liked. How could I, when Barbie herself is a doctor with a pink stethoscope? I did not see anything wrong with wanting to be a writer, ballerina or president of the United States – they were big dreams, but that did not mean they were impossible.
As I got older, I realized it wasn’t just the adults in my life tearing down my aspirations – it was my peers, too. My classmates went through the typical “I hate pink” phase, making fun of me for wearing pink and bows. They would even scoff at what I wanted to be when I grew up, whether it was becoming the president or a movie director. I didn’t understand – what was so wrong with pink and liking “girly” things while having big dreams?
I remember sitting down in the kitchen with my mom when I was in sixth grade to ask her if she thought I could ever be president or a writer while liking pink. She repeated the sentiment I heard my whole life from Barbie – “I think you can be anything you want to be. And I can’t wait to see you in a full pink suit when you become president.”
My mom reassured me with her kind words, but they were easier to believe because I looked up to Barbie my entire life while watching her movies, commercials and shows. As a little girl, having this iconic figure made me feel confident in my tastes, aspirations and femininity. My goals were not something to be embarrassed about, but something I should be proud of. Barbie is a testament to the fact that no dream is too small or too big, but it’s also OK to outgrow your dreams or find new ones. And seeing Barbie being successful while being feminine was reassuring. My love for pink was part of who I was, and it did not make me less intelligent or serious. To this day, I love pink, dressing up and wearing bows in my hair.
Although Barbie has been under scrutiny before for promoting unrealistic beauty standards – a problem that is being addressed with dolls of more sizes and ethnicities – we seem to forget everything else that Barbie represents. Barbie teaches young girls that they should follow their dreams and be comfortable in their own skin. Especially in a society where femininity is often belittled, Barbie reminds women to be our most unapologetic selves and to never be embarrassed for who we are or what we want.
We can be anything.

An interim editor in chief will lead The Hatchet into its 120th volume starting Monday in place of Managing Editor Jaden DiMauro, who was elected to the position in February.
Senior News Editor Zach Blackburn will serve as the next editor in chief when The Hatchet kicks off its upcoming volume next week after DiMauro notified editors earlier this month of his plans to step back from the job for personal reasons. Blackburn, who was set to work as managing editor in the upcoming volume, will steer the newspaper until The Hatchet’s staff elects a permanent editor in chief during summer break.
The Hatchet’s Board of Directors elected Blackburn earlier this month to serve as the president of Hatchet Publications, Inc. effective Monday. In the case Hatchet staff elects a new editor in chief, the board will decide whether to approve them as president.
Junior Nick Pasion, who served alongside Blackburn as a senior news editor this past year, will assume managing editor responsibilities, which he was initially slated to split with Blackburn in the next volume.
Blackburn, a junior political communication major from West Columbia, South Carolina, has directed news coverage of the decision to arm GW Police Department officers, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ withdrawal from teaching a GW Law seminar and the selection process for GW’s next moniker. He previously served as The Hatchet’s metro editor, covering the University’s dining transformation, the implementation of U-Pass and a mold outbreak that temporarily shut down Townhouse Row.
Blackburn has familiarized himself with sections across The Hatchet during his time on the newspaper, covering women’s basketball’s playoff run in Wilmington, Delaware and racking up numerous culture bylines that span movie reviews, Dish of the Week articles and more.
The Hatchet, which will enter its 120th volume Monday, is an editorially and financially independent student newspaper serving the GW and Foggy Bottom communities. It is the second oldest D.C. newspaper after The Washington Post.

Dimitri Piskapas, one of Alitiko's co-owners, said he hopes to emulate a standard Greek gyro shop through the restaurant's menu.
Alitiko, a Greek-inspired restaurant, opened in Western Market Foodhall Monday.
Alitiko serves gyros with salads, fries and rice from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday. Dimitri Piskapas, one of Alitiko’s co-owners, said he hopes to emulate a standard Greek gyro shop through the restaurant’s menu.
He said the restaurant grills and roasts its meats, instead of using a traditional spit. He said he chose Western Market as the restaurant’s first location because of his background in the District.
“We’re from Maryland originally,” Piskapas said. “I do a lot of work in D.C. myself.”
Piskapas said he hopes to add a vegetable option to the current offerings of chicken, pork, lamb and meatball sometime next week, and he hopes to add dessert and handheld dishes like spanakopita and tiropita in the next few months, depending on the restaurant’s performance.
Western Market spokesperson Ali Gorban said last August the restaurant was set to open by the end of the month. Piskapas said the delays were due to “last-minute touches” and “nothing out of the ordinary.”
Piskapas said he has noticed “lots” of GW students frequenting the restaurant since its opening on Monday.
“I just hope everybody’s enjoying the food and getting it in a timely manner,” Piskapas said.

The latest model can travel 20 miles per hour and have 60-mile 500 watt batteries, front LED lights and reflective paint.
Capital Bikeshare will add 900 additional electric bikes to District-area stations by Monday.
Capital Bikeshare, a bicycle-sharing system with over 5,000 bikes across more than 600 docking stations in the D.C. area, will have added 700 new gray e-bikes in D.C. and 150 in Fairfax and Arlington counties “by May,” according to a DCist report from last month. The latest e-bike model can travel 20 miles per hour and has 60-mile 500-watt batteries in their frames, LED lights and reflective paint.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a release last month that Capital Bikeshare will add 200 e-bikes to “neighboring jurisdictions.”
Capital Bikeshare distributed 80 units of its first e-bike model in September 2018, which is a dockless black e-bike that can travel 18 miles per hour. The Bikeshare program pulled the black e-bikes from circulation in April 2019 following concerns with the model’s braking system but returned them to the streets in July 2020. The black e-bikes now currently make up 300 of more than 5,000 bikes in circulation.
“Our newest e-bike has cutting-edge features that riders love, making Capital Bikeshare better than ever,” General Manager of Capital Bikeshare at Lyft Dominick Tribone said in the release last month. “We’re making it easier than ever for people to reach jobs, family, and friends with sustainable, climate-friendly transportation that gets cars off our roads.”
Single-trip Capital Bikeshare users can unlock the e-bikes for $1 and use them for $0.15 per minute. University students and “benefit-eligible” faculty and staff enrolled in GW’s Capital Bikeshare annual membership program for $25 per year can access the e-bikes for $0.10 per minute.
Capital Bikeshare reported that around 31,000 of its 200,000 bike trips were on the system’s 300 e-bikes in February. The District Department of Transportation said the agency hopes to bring 2,500 more e-bikes to the District over the next “several years” in a March statement.
Prior to arriving in the District, Capital Bikeshare introduced the new e-bike model to Chicago and New York City in fall 2021 and fall 2022, respectively.
The rollout of the new gray e-bike model comes as Mayor Bowser attempts to address bike safety in the District through her Vision Zero traffic safety program, which has “fallen short” of its work to end traffic deaths by 2024. D.C. officials have installed 45 miles of bike lanes since the program launched in February 2015, with a total of 108 miles of bike lanes and 30 miles of protected bike lanes.
Ten cyclists died on D.C. roads from 2017 to 2021, with 1,491 cyclist injuries reported.

Officials said Wednesday that Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert Contee III will leave his post to join the FBI.
Contee said in a video statement Wednesday his official last day will be June 3, but Mayor Muriel Bowser has yet to determine his successor. Contee said FBI Director Christopher Wray appointed him to serve as assistant director in the Office of Partner Engagement.
“It has been my greatest honor to serve as the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department,” Contee said in an MPD tweet Wednesday.
MPD did not immediately return a request for comment.
Bowser said Contee has made the District “incredibly proud” throughout his 33 years of service and congratulated Contee on his “retirement,” saying he is “ready for his next chapter.”
“He has pushed our criminal justice system to do more and be better,” Bowser said in a statement. “He has led MPD through an incredibly challenging time in our country – from the pandemic to January 6th and navigating the effects of a shrinking department during a time when gun violence is exploding across the nation.”
Bowser did not immediately return a request for comment regarding Contee’s resignation.
Contee, a GW alumnus, joined MPD in November 1989 and served as a patrol officer, sergeant and lieutenant. Bowser announced Contee as her pick for MPD chief in December 2020, swearing him into office Jan. 2, 2021, just days before the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol building.
D.C.’s Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety cut MPD’s budget by $15 million in June 2020.
Contee said in an interview with The Hatchet in June 2021 he mandated each MPD bureau hold monthly events where officials and community members can interact, like officers reading with children or providing IT help to senior citizens. Under Contee, MPD hired Diana Karczmarczyk, a professional lecturer in the Milken Institute School of Public Health, as the department’s first director of employee well-being support.

Rep. Gloria Johnson, who Tennessee House Republicans attempted to oust after a protest for gun reform on the House floor in March, said advocates must vote for candidates who support "common sense gun laws."
A member of the Tennessee House of Representatives discussed her involvement in a demonstration for gun control that interrupted legislative proceedings on the chamber’s floor at the University Student Center Monday.
Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, said Tennessee House Republicans have suppressed Democratic opposition in the state’s legislature by voting to expel two lawmakers who joined her in protesting for gun reform on the House floor earlier this month following a shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville that killed three children and three school officials in March. The event was hosted by Swing Left GWU, a left-leaning political advocacy group, and March For Our Lives GW, a gun violence prevention student organization.
John Fine, logistics and operations director of Swing Left GWU, and Helen Newell, financial officer for March For Our Lives GW, moderated the event. 
The Tennessee House – where Republicans hold 74 of the body’s 99 seats – voted to expel Reps. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, and Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, for breaking House decorum rules in their protest on April 6 after their protest on March 30, which halted legislative action on the floor. Johnson said she and the two lawmakers, dubbed the “Tennessee Three,” led chants in the chamber with a bullhorn to “lift up” the voices of protestors rallying for gun control outside the Tennessee Capitol in Nashville that day.
In resolutions to expel Johnson, Pearson and Jones, House Republicans said the three lawmakers “generally engaged in disorderly and disruptive conduct.” Johnson, who was spared expulsion in a 65-30 vote – falling short of the required two-thirds majority by one vote – said “the racism was very clear” regarding the House’s decision to expel Jones and Pearson because of the difference in criticism posed by House Republicans toward her, a white person, compared to Jones and Pearson, who are Black.
“If you listen to the questioning, the way they talk to the two young men, young Black men, was completely different than how they talked to me,” Johnson said. “They were demeaning to me, but for him, it was, ‘Well you need to dress like us and you need to speak like us.’”
The Nashville Metropolitan Council voted unanimously to reinstate Jones to his House seat on April 10, who the House swore back in the same day, and the Shelby County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to reinstate Pearson on April 12, who was sworn in the following day. 
Both representatives said they will seek reelection in their respective special elections triggered by the expulsions on Aug. 3.
Johnson said she hears racist statements “pretty much every day” in committee meetings or on the Tennessee House floor. She said it was “horrific” when Rep. Paul Sherrell, R-Sparta, suggested adding “hanging on a tree” as an execution method for death row inmates in an amendment to a bill giving death row inmates the choice to die by firing squad rather than lethal injection or electrocution on March 1. She compared his suggestion – which Sherrell apologized for on March 2 – to “lynching.” 
“I was just in shock,” Johnson said. “The man just advocated for a hate crime. He didn’t say a gallows, he said hanging by a tree, and we all know what that is.”
She said House Republicans, have recently been “silencing any dissenting voice,” shutting off Democratic lawmakers’ mics, refraining from calling on representatives to speak and refusing to hear some of the amendments they proposed this year.
“This is not how a healthy democracy behaves,” Johnson said. “It’s really scary that they are so terrified of an opposition view that they cut our debate time to five minutes.”
Johnson said advocates must vote for candidates who support “common sense gun laws” and help organize events that raise awareness for gun control when asked what organizations like Swing Left GWU and March For Our Lives GW can do to help support the fight against gun violence in states like Tennessee.
“We’re counting on you all,” Johnson said. “We really, really are.”
Johnson said she received “overwhelming” support from people outside the legislature following her protest on the House floor, when asked how she maintains “optimism and motivation” in the Republican-led House.  
“That’s something that my colleagues across the aisle miss, is that the majority of the people – even their folks – are with us and respect what we did,” Johnson said.
Johnson said the percentage of women in the legislature dropped since she was elected in 2012, citing “hideous” attack campaigns ads during the state’s elections as the reason for this decrease.
“I’m running for office, and there’s mail going out, there’s TV commercials, there’s digital, a picture of me covered in blood spatter and saying that all my friends are violent criminals,” Johnson said. 
Women comprise 51 percent of Tennessee’s population as of July 2022, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 11 of the state’s 99 representatives are women and eight of the state’s 33 senators are women, according to Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics.
Johnson said it is “critical” that Tennessee works to make the gender demographics of the state legislature similar to that of the state’s population. She said women do an “excellent job” representing their districts.
“I do believe that we change the conversation when there are more women in office, and we just desperately, desperately need that,” Johnson said. “So I will tell you, ignore the bullies, ignore the noise, step up, be real, do what’s in your heart.”
