GW Engineering Dean John Lach said the new brand identity emerged from conversations with faculty, staff and alumni about the engineering community.
School of Engineering and Applied Science officials changed the school’s moniker to GW Engineering to bring more awareness to its programs, according to an email sent to the school last month.
John Lach, the dean of GW Engineering, said in the email that officials began using GW Engineering as a brand moniker, and the phrase “Engineering And…” as a new brand identity this fall. Lach said the brand identity “Engineering And…” emerged from conversations with faculty, staff and alumni about their interests in studying engineering alongside different “societal contexts” like public health, law and international affairs.
“Many of our alumni are living ‘Engineering And…’ by leveraging their technical foundation, broader perspective and leadership skills in a variety of societal sectors, and they point to their diverse experiences at GW as a key driver of their success,” Lach said an email. 
This transition comes amid a wave of rebranding monikers at the University, with the Board of Trustees currently working to replace the Colonials moniker following years of student pressure. Officials also renamed the former Cloyd Heck Marvin Center the University Student Center following years of student pressure over its namesake’s racist legacy. 
Lach said the inspiration for the moniker change originally came from the National Advisory Council, GW’s alumni advisory board, who want more people to know about engineering at GW and thought a name change could help advertise the school. He said the moniker received “broad support” after its proposal at a school-wide meeting in September 2022.
“Over the last couple of years, I discussed the proposed moniker with the school’s department chairs, staff directors and several student groups, and it was received positively,” Lach said.
Lach said refining the “outward-facing” moniker will increase brand awareness because the SEAS moniker is not as “well-known” outside of academia.
“We want everyone – prospective students, employers, industry partners and the general public – to know that there is an engineering school at GW, and using ‘GW Engineering’ on our website, communications and promotional materials will help with that,” Lach said in an email.
The school’s website will change from seas.gwu.edu to engineering.gwu.edu, and the school will create a ‘standards and usage guide,’ an outline explaining how the branding will apply to “media and promotional items,” to ensure the change is consistent for all branding.
“This new brand identity reflects what our school is, what we stand for and what we aspire to be,” Lach said. “Engineering at GW is special, and we want the world to know that.”

Pacci’s offers 17 different wood-fired pizzas, ranging from $14 to $19.
The family-owned restaurant Pacci’s Trattoria replicates a true Italian eatery serving up authentic cuisine influenced by a love for fine food and Neapolitan tradition.
Pacci’s opened its doors to customers for the first time in February, and the Capitol Hill restaurant joins the original in Silver Spring to mark the establishment’s second location since 2011. The restaurant specializes in classic pasta, calzones and pizza prepared in classic wood-fired brick ovens, separating Pacci’s from other standard Americanized Italian restaurants.
As I arrived at the restaurant, situated across the street from Lincoln Park, the brick exterior of the building with its large arched windows and small balcony, stood out from the townhouses on either side of Pacci’s. Lit with an amber chandelier and warm lamps throughout the restaurant, Pacci’s interior features two dining rooms, one on the entry floor and one in the basement, and a bar holding up to 10 people. The open floor plan exposes the kitchen so customers dining upstairs can watch their food being prepared.
The friendly staff welcomed me into the restaurant with smiling faces regardless of the fact that I had shown up at 7 p.m. as a walk-in during what seemed to be the peak of their dinner rush. As I got situated at the last open spot at the bar, I couldn’t help but notice the large brick pizza oven on display in the exposed kitchen, signaling that I was in for a true Italian dinner.
The dinner menu, split into five sections of antipasti, le insalate, la pasta, calzones and pizza neapolitana, offers classic Italian dishes like their margherita pizza ($14.75), polla alla parmigiana ($26.75) and bruschetta al pomodoro ($10.75). Available Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Pacci’s has five different sandwich options that come with a side of fries and a soft drink for lunch, and Sunday, an all-you-can-eat brunch buffet ($39.95) is served.
I stopped in for dinner, and while the pasta options were tempting, I knew upon scanning the menu that I had to try one of the hand-crafted pizzas. Pacci’s offers 17 different wood-fired pizzas, ranging from $14.75 to $18.75. The menu is divided up between red and white sauce pies, with more than 25 toppings options varying from basics like pepperoni and olives to lesser-seen options like spicy Neapolitan salami. Each pizza comes with six slices, enough to satisfy one person for a full dinner or to share among multiple people as a light meal or appetizer.
After what felt like the impossible task of narrowing it down to just one pizza, I eventually settled on ordering the Al Tartufo ($16.75) – one of the white pizza options topped with smoked mozzarella, parmesan, mushrooms and fresh basil and drizzled with truffle oil and extra virgin olive oil. The name translates to ‘with truffle’ in English, and the combination of complementary flavors drew me in to make the selection.
The pizza arrived just 10 minutes after I placed my order, nearly spilling off the sizable plate that carried it from beneath. Once the dish was set in front of me, the aromatic smell from the cheeses and truffle oil reaffirmed my pick.
Their pizzas are made Neapolitan style in a 800-degree brick oven, crafting a sharp and smokey taste after being cooked for roughly 90 seconds. The crust came out light and airy, prepared to a crispy, golden perfection.
The smokey taste in the crust, amplified by its mildly burnt edges, contrasted with the pizza’s earthy flavors marked by the truffle oil and mushroom toppings. The truffle oil drizzle proved to be just right – enough to add extra flavor to the pizza without overpowering the other toppings. The mushrooms filled up each slice, presenting a new, chewy texture to each bite.
The blend of smoked mozzarella and parmesan cheese made for a perfect pairing, as the mozzarella offered a light and subtle taste that worked well with the sharp, rich flavor of the parmesan. The two cheeses were placed between the base and the toppings of the pizza to preserve the oils while keeping it from becoming overly greasy.
The basil pulled the dish together with a fresh leafy taste. The flavors from the other toppings were light and neutral, so the basil introduced a sweet, almost minty taste unlike any other to the pizza.
After finishing my meal, ordering a treat was difficult to pass up as Pacci’s dessert menu consists of cannolis, tiramisu, limoncello shortcake and other Italian sweets for $11.75 each, but I found myself pleasantly full from my meal.
If you’re in search of an authentic Italian spot serving Neapolitan-inspired pizza and pasta in the D.C. area, Pacci’s Trattoria is a must-try destination that’s worth the venture over to Capitol Hill.

Facing a problem yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
Dear Annie,
My friend recently confided in me that he likes the same girl as me. The problem is I want to abide by the rules of friendship, but I also am fairly certain that the same girl is into me (and gay). How far should the “bro” code go if she’s not even into his gender?
Help please,
Close to Joining a Midwestern Emo Band
Dear Close to Joining a Midwestern Emo Band,
Why join a Midwestern emo band when you already have the ingredients for your own punk musical act? With two people pining after the same girl and a stereotypical Midwestern desire for nicety over honesty, even staunch pop fans would fawn over your music.
Friendship necessitates honesty – even when it hurts. This honesty – that the girl probably likes you and is (possibly) not even into his gender – is far from the worst thing you could tell a friend. Imagine telling your bro you went behind his back with the girl. Dating right under his nose could cause irreparable damage to your friendship of Scandoval proportions, causing you to lose the trust of everyone in your friend group.
Before you talk with your bro, consider your intentions with the girl because any dalliance with her could cause at least a sprinkle of awkwardness in your friendship. Are you looking for a long-term relationship, a finals-season fling or a singular night to release the sexual tension? Whatever you decide, how will this girl fit into your friendship? Consider boundaries you may set, like not talking with your bro about this budding romance or avoiding physical affection in front of him.
Jenna Baer | Staff Cartoonist
When explaining yourself to your bro, avoid assuming anyone’s sexual or romantic preferences since they’re complicated, personal and fluid. Emphasize that you like her. Say while you normally would abandon this crush to avoid competing with your bro, you think she reciprocates your attraction. Share the signs – verbal or nonverbal – she gave you. Did you use a “Levels of Attraction” quiz you saw on TikTok to evaluate if her behavior toward you is platonic or romantic? Stress that you never intended to steal the girl, but you cannot give up the opportunity to chase seemingly requited affection.
You wouldn’t be the first bros to duke it out over a girl. In “This Means War,” two CIA agents played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy compete for Reese Witherspoon’s character, Lauren Scott. After shooting at each other for an hour and a half, they reconcile. While one bro gets Scott, the other bro finds someone who was better suited for him in the first place. Crushing – and even competing – for the same girl does not mean a friendship has to end.
Whether you call it the “bro code” or the “friendship code,” honesty and mutual respect bind their rules together. Learning your love interest is (possibly) gay is better than rejection. It’s a messy situation, but honesty will ensure your relationship stays in the clear.
Hope this helps to navigate your Oh [so] Messy Life,
Annie<3

“Learning the hard way is the only way I seem to learn,” I thought to myself as I bounded towards the sunrise on a hot and sticky summer morning in the rural suburbs of Philadelphia. Little did I know that the open road would become my canvas for change.
I committed to running a marathon last fall, which loomed over my warm summer months spent at home. The miles felt shorter day after day, and I had plenty of time to create the person I aspired to be while gliding past the seemingly endless neighborhoods, cornfields and pickup trucks that surround my house. As the scorching heat from the tarmac started to make its way through my running shoes, I reflected on my past. I spent my first year in the District grappling with the pressure of newfound independence. Days no longer followed a discernible pattern, and the tides of my whims and the spontaneous social invitations from my friends dictated my schedule. I missed out on office hours, trips exploring D.C. and anything that required a bit of mindful preparation.
On these long and difficult runs, I realized that I was capable of reaping more from the 24 hours than I am given each day. I began to compose a set of mental expectations that provided updated requirements for my fulfillment. I prioritized the interests that brought me true fulfillment – activities that necessitated mindfulness like reading, writing, spending time outside and exploring a new neighborhood with my friends. But I felt like I learned these lessons a bit too late. I already missed out on the lifestyle I should have had as a freshman, and turning back the clock is impossible. I couldn’t come to terms with the fact that, although I would learn through life experiences, I’d continue to face new problems that taught me hard-earned lessons.
Sitting at home with my feet up and my body thoroughly exhausted, I recovered from the day’s foray into the unrelenting sun. As I recovered, I realized that my philosophy towards running was in itself a counter to my cynicism. The process of running and recovery involves building muscles and cardiovascular tolerance, but it is built through a series of tough lessons. With each run, I broke my body down to the point where I was on my knees panting by the end. But the period of recovery would elicit a newfound strength that – sometimes – revealed itself in my next run. Instead of trying to change in spite of our past, we should change because of the past and the lessons excised from it.
Tyler, The Creator beautifully illustrates this concept of growth through a depiction of rebirth in his new music video for his single “Sorry Not Sorry” released last week. I see that mentality as a progression that represents pursuit for the best version of myself.
As the curtains open on the “Sorry Not Sorry” music video, Tyler’s many forms are displayed on stage, representing his entire discography. Accompanied by expansive horns and occasional choral crescendos, Tyler apologizes to people in his life he has hurt. While doing so, he slowly drags each iteration of himself off the stage. But despite his apologies, his message still comes across like a statement of defiance. Throughout the song, he articulates that although he recognizes the effects his personal evolution can have on others, he will continue to reinvent himself.
The “Sorry Not Sorry” video concludes with violent visuals of the shirtless Tyler beating up his most recent persona from his 2021 album “Call Me if You Get Lost,” symbolizing an ushering in of yet another era of the artist. Tyler conceptualizes growth as a form of reinvention. Instead of trying to change in spite of our past, we should change because of the past and the lessons learned from it.
I dragged my freshman self off stage last semester, and I was born again in the fall. Early mornings spent running before class set a precedent of mindfulness that dictated my entire day. I didn’t feel like I was always a step behind in class anymore – I largely avoided the built-up stress and anxiety that typically accompanied classwork. This was growth, no doubt about it, and my spirit was wide open.
But other parts of my routine shifted somewhat significantly from freshman year. I no longer instinctively asked friends to eat together, and I often rejected invitations from friends because of the next day’s run or to stay on top of academics. I didn’t consider the effect this would have for the people around me until I heard indirectly that one of my friends said “I can’t wait till Michael is done with all this marathon stuff.”
The fact that this positive improvement was not universally lauded by the people around me came as a surprise and quickly turned to frustration. I expect a friend to push me toward growth, not hope I stay the same for convenience. While I am sorry I can no longer be the person who I was expected to be, I am not sorry for the ever-changing definition of “me.”
Tyler constantly redefines what it means to be “Tyler, The Creator” through his evolution from album to album, but for me, each new semester is my rebirth. As the spring turns into summer, the person that I was will be dragged off stage yet again as I continue to reinvent myself.

With no tournament wins on the board, the Colonials have been looking for a solid, all-around showing to bolster their confidence heading into the A-10 Championship.
Golf placed eighth in their second-to-last tournament before the A-10 Championship, shooting a 22-over, 874 at the SeattleU Redhawk Invitational on Tuesday.
The Colonials, who seemed to be riding a wave of momentum coming off of three-straight top-three tournament finishes, finished 21 strokes behind the victorious Idaho, who fired a three-round 853. Freshman Manuel Barbachano led the way for GW with a three-over-par performance, good enough to position him in a tie for 15th, outpacing seniors Jakub Hrinda and Hugo Riboud by seven and 10 strokes, respectively.
The eighth-place finish marks the lowest-place finish for the team all season, and the 22 strokes over par number is their highest since late September at the Howard Intercollegiate, where the team’s 40-over-par performance was enough to earn them a second-place finish.
The penultimate regular season tournament took place in Seattle, Washington, where GW hoped to continue their streak of top-three finishes. Instead, the five-man team was dragged down by a messy second-round showing of 297, nine strokes higher than their first round 288 and eight strokes worse than the final-round performance of 289.
Despite the disappointing team performance, Barbachano’s final round 68, that featured five birdies, underscores the young core that, in combination with the more experienced Hrinda and Riboud, Head Coach Chuck Scheinost has been excited about all year.
“We’ve broken almost every record in program history in one year,” Coach Scheinost said in an interview last week. “Jakub has come a long way since his freshman year, he’s really developed. Hugo has stepped up his game and though the last couple tournaments haven’t gone his way, he’s improved drastically.”
The slipup will have no concrete bearing on the team’s A-10 Championship hopes. With no seeding, every team enters the tournament on equal footing, and the tournament winner is determined purely on the best three-round team score, but it will likely not bode well for the Colonials’ national rankings.
With no tournament wins on the board, but plenty of stellar individual performances that include victories from Hrinda and Barbachano, the Colonials have been looking for a solid, all-around showing to bolster their confidence heading into the A-10 Championship. GW placed second in their previous tournament, the Golden Horseshoe Invitational, falling just two strokes short in the final round.
“I think the nerves of trying to get that first win got to us a little bit,” Coach Scheinost said in an interview last week. “But we’re gonna get there. I truly believe that this team is special, and I think in these next couple weeks, if we continue to be ourselves, we’re gonna be in a position to have the results we wanted to have this year.”
Freshman Rodrigo Barahona turned in a 13 over 226, bringing up the rear for the team, but improving steadily throughout his three rounds, starting with a 78, followed by a 75 and finishing with a 73.
The Colonials will move on to the final regular season tournament of the long season as they head to Pittsburgh for The Redhawk Intercollegiate April 17.

“Does anyone have any contrasting opinions?” is a phrase I have heard all too many times in a political science classroom as the professor scans the class for brave hands in the air. The existing raised hands, eager to add onto a previously constructed argument with a new point, immediately retreat to their resting positions. Instead, eyes dart around the room, surveying the desks for an unexpected “traitor.”
Alas, the room is quiet and the professor moves on. The faint clicking of keyboards resumes and the status quo remains unchanged. On occasion, the professor offers to “play devil’s advocate,” every political science student’s favorite game, and the class erupts with deep sighs and eyerolls. The conversation never goes far, as students regurgitate previously vocalized ideas, and the professor moves on, defeated.
While it’s important to surround yourself with like-minded individuals who share similar worldviews to your own, there is such a thing as too much congruent company. Every year, GW admits hundreds of students to its political science and international affairs programs, drawing young minds from all over the world. The programs promise to immerse students in a well-rounded and holistic education, meant to prepare young adults for careers in public service and government.
But although my classes provide me with substantial knowledge in political science and international affairs, I often feel that I am insulated in an ideological bubble. As I participate in classroom discussions, I rarely, if ever, find myself disagreeing with the general tone of what is being said by my classmates. That is not to say that I do not learn new things or gain a deeper understanding of material through these discussions, but as for broadening my understanding and being exposed to a range of different opinions, I find my classes leaving much to be desired.
While I sit and listen to my classmates articulate their opinions and comfortably share my own, I feel a sense of validation and safety emanating from within the room. I’ll admit, I enjoy watching my classmates nod in agreement. I like hearing my own thoughts reverberated around the room. I even take pleasure in looking over and seeing The New York Times open on my classmate’s laptop to a piece I read earlier that day. I feel content knowing that my view is at least outwardly shared by the rest of the class.
But is this ecochamber-like environment effectively preparing me for a career in government and public policy? When I zoom out from my desk in a dimly lit classroom in the basement of the Elliott School, it is clear that I operate in a very niche environment. The entirety of the country – let alone the world – is not listening to “Morning Edition” from NPR on their walk to class and tuning into CNN to catch the news in the afternoon. In fact, this is one of the luxuries of our democracy.
In just two and a half short years, the safety blanket that has coddled me will be ripped off, and I will be left exposed in a landscape very different from the one in which I have resided for quite some time. I will be flung into the real world, engaging with people who will inevitably look at the world through a rather different lens than I do. When I peer into this future, having little experience communicating with people whose ideologies differ from my own does not seem quite as comforting anymore. It seems daunting, and it should.
Of course, feeling safe and understood is important to one’s development. Students should feel some level of comfort – and certainly physical safety – on their college campus. But the importance of discomfort should not be understated. My bachelor’s of art degree in political science will mean nothing if I cannot communicate with and civilly address people who have differing opinions from my own. Being able to articulate contested ideas and engage in meaningful discourse is paramount to just about any position in politics.
These four years in college are meant to sharpen students’ abilities to form opinions and substantiate them respectfully and effectively. I should be learning how to respond to ideas that challenge my own and build a framework for finding common ground and pushing forward – but this is not the case.
Now, more than ever, we are seeing the detrimental effects of division in our country. While college campuses are by no means the root of this problem, they do highlight an effect of it. We will never be able to bridge the divide if we are not exposed to opinions that challenge our own and acquire tools for thoughtful debate.
Sometimes discomfort is the greatest learning experience of all – but it is one that I am not getting in my political science classes at GW.

Bridgers, Dacus and Baker continue to highlight one another’s strengths as individual artists while cementing their sound as a band.
On their debut full-length album – simply titled “the record” – released last week, boygenius is grounded by their yearslong artistic collaboration and friendship.
Through their personal and astute lyrics, boygenius – an indie-rock supergroup made up of singer-songwriters Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker – discusses falling in love, feeling nihilistic and their sacred friendship with one another. Bridgers, Dacus and Baker continue to highlight one another’s strengths as individual artists while cementing their sound as a band following their critically acclaimed self-titled 2018 EP.
To the delight of many of boygenius’ fans, the release of “the record” was accompanied by a visually stunning 14-minute long short film directed by actress and director Kristen Stewart. The short film tells the stories of three songs off the album, “$20,” “Emily I’m Sorry” and “True Blue,” complete with blood oaths, monster trucks and blue paint-covered makeout sessions.
As they kick off “the record” with Track 1, “Without You Without Them,” the members of boygenius sing a capella, allowing the song to stand apart from their typically guitar-heavy sound. Through their mesmerizing three-part harmony, boygenius delivers a thesis for their album – in an increasingly isolated world, the relationships we forge with one another are essential to our well-being. With lyrics like “Give me everything you’ve got / I’ll take what I can get / I want to hear your story / And be a part of it,” the band speaks to our collective desire to connect with and understand one another.
In a sharp pivot from the album’s opener, Track 2, “$20,” hits listeners with a captivating guitar riff reminiscent of songs from Dacus’ 2021 solo record “Home Video.” As Baker takes on lead vocals accompanied by Dacus and Bridgers’ sporadic harmonies, she sings of a desire for rebellion. From the opening lyric of “It’s a bad idea and I’m all about it” to the impassioned closing lyric of “I know you have 20 dollars,” which Bridgers screams as the outro fades out, boygenius illustrates a coming-of-age story tinged with recklessness and desperation.
boygenius furthers the emotional depth of “the record” on the album’s third song, “Emily I’m Sorry.” With a lyrical style similar to her 2020 solo record “Punisher,” Bridgers leads the introspective track as she drafts a heartbroken apology to a former partner. Through her hushed vocals, Bridgers sets an ambient mood as she reflects on the role she played in the deterioration of their relationship. As Bridgers sings “I’m 27 and I don’t know who I am / But I know what I want” with supporting vocals from Baker and Dacus, she exemplifies the conflict of losing her sense of self but wanting to stay in a relationship – even if that may not be the healthiest choice.
On Track 4, “True Blue,” the band returns to one of the album’s overarching themes – the power of feeling seen and understood. Dacus sings over breezy and calming instrumentals as she pens a love letter to a friendship that is “true blue,” or one that is truly loyal. From lines like “Who won the fight? I don’t know / We’re not keeping score” to “I can’t hide from you like I hide from myself / I remember who I am when I’m with you,” boygenius celebrates the friendships that rise above frivolous conflicts and make you feel like the truest version of yourself.
“Cool About It,” the quiet and contemplative fifth track, continues boygenius’ reflection on current and past relationships. As they draw inspiration from the lyrical and guitar style of Paul Simon, the members of boygenius examine how faltering communication causes a relationship to come apart at the seams. Throughout each of their solo verses, Baker, Dacus and Bridgers overthink romantic interactions as they try not to rock the boat of the troubled relationship at the heart of this song. “I can walk you home and practice method acting / I’ll pretend bein’ with you doesn’t feel like drowning,” the members sing in harmony as they confess how overwhelming it is to pretend everything in this relationship is fine.
“Not Strong Enough,” a country-pop tune, lies at the center of the track list and finds boygenius at their most unified moment on “the record.” Although they collectively lament about not feeling good enough to be someone’s partner and how this insecurity drives them to selfishness, the track’s anthemic instrumentals make “Not Strong Enough” a joyful moment on the album. The song reaches a true moment of catharsis in the bridge, as Bridgers, Baker and Dacus repeat the line “Always an angel, never a god.” As the bridge reaches its most intense moment, the song transitions into the final chorus. Dacus sings, “I don’t know why I am the way I am,” continuing the group’s introspection.
Following the high intensity of “Not Strong Enough,” boygenius transitions to a quieter moment on the song “Revolution 0.” Led by Bridgers’ vocals, Track 7 chronicles the feeling of falling in love with lyrics like “If it isn’t love / Then what the f*ck is it?” The song was originally titled “Paul is Dead” – according to photographs shared by album producer Catherine Marks – in reference to The Beatles conspiracy theory that Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike. Many believe the name is a hint at actor Paul Mescal, Bridgers’ ex-fiancee, as the potential subject of this song.
On their album’s final song, “Letter To An Old Poet,” boygenius creates a full circle moment as they make allusions to their fan-favorite single from their 2018 EP, “Me & My Dog.” The song’s bridge is a mirrored image of the bridge in the original 2018 track, swapping “I wish I was on a spaceship / Just me and my dog and an impossible view” with “I’ll go up to the top of our building / And remember my dog when I see the full moon.” The closing track also interpolates cheers from the band’s 2018 Brooklyn Steel performance of “Me & My Dog,” demonstrating both how far boygenius has come in just five years and how grounded they remain.

The final determination of the funds depends on whether the Dean of Students agrees to fund the purchase per the bill.
The Student Bar Association Senate unanimously approved a bill Tuesday returning leftover organization funds to students in need.
Senators unanimously allocated $7,286.29 to either the Student Assistance Fund – which helps students in need pay for emergency food or transportation – or to a laptop program that would allow law students to check out laptops for short durations from the Jacob Burns Law Library. The final determination of the funds depends on whether the Dean of Students agrees to fund the purchase per the bill.
SBA Sen. John Tuley, the chair of the finance committee, said the SBA donated $18,000 last year to the Student Assistance Fund, which did not reach the fund until “a couple of weeks ago” – meaning next year’s student can use that $18,000. He said students might lose or break their current laptops and may not be able to afford to purchase a new one, and the programs can allow students to survive their school day.
“Why not figure out something right now that we can give that will positively impact students where they need it?” Tuley said. “Something that has been said by multiple senators is that we need to meet students where they’re at.”
SBA Sen. Delaney Gatine said they will purchase 10 HP laptops with 12 GB of storage and insurance protecting them for three years, with more than $200 left for the maintenance and upkeep of the laptops. She said the SBA would work with Burns Library to establish a system for checking out laptops similar to the current system for checking out laptop chargers.
Law students may borrow chargers from the library for up to four hours.
Senators also unanimously agreed to allocate $1,710.79 to GW Law Soccer so they can purchase new equipment like nets and soccer balls, and they unanimously approved $800 to go to the Muslim Law Student Association to fund an Eid dinner with between 30 and 40 attendees planned for April 22.
The senate also unanimously agreed to allocate $1,210.80 to cover the cost of 20 need-based tickets for the SBA’s  annual Barrister’s Ball.
“We are in a profession that is entirely grounded in ethics and honesty,” SBA Sen. Cody Ingraham said. “And I think that we’re also a body that values equity. Regardless of whatever income bracket you come to, or whatever you come to law school with, that shouldn’t keep you away from a law school tradition simply based on that.”
Senators unanimously approved the founding of the Disability Law Society, which seeks to provide a space for law students interested in disability law. Mary Zenger, the president of the Atypical Student Society, represented the Disability Law Society and urged senators to recognize the new student organization.
“I was diagnosed with a permanent disability at the end of this past summer,” Zenger said. “And so it’s always been really important to me that there was a voice for people like myself on this campus.”
Senators also unanimously agreed to approve the creation of GW Law Squash, which will organize weekly squash games, and GW for the People, an organization focused on prosecution and providing opportunities for students to connect with attorneys practicing different types of prosecution.
The next SBA Senate meeting will be held April 18 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

The release states the vending machines are part of a pilot program aimed at understanding the utilization and effect eased access to the products will have on the "wellbeing" of an area. 
D.C. officials will roll out six “harm reduction” vending machines across the District stocked with lifesaving tools, like Naloxone, Fentanyl strips and hygiene and wellness products, according to a Tuesday release.
DC Health, the Department of Behavioral Health and D.C. Fire and Emergency Services are adding the vending machines in “strategically placed” locations like outside firehouses where officials say there are higher rates of drug overdoses and that they have already placed four vending machines around the District.  The release states the vending machines are part of a pilot program aimed at understanding the utilization and effect eased access to the products will have on the “wellbeing” of an area.
Here’s where to find the machines:
“Similar machines have become prevalent in cities nationwide because they provide easy access to critical services that benefit the most vulnerable populations,” the release states.
DC Health’s announcement to provide Naloxone vending machines follows other large U.S. cities like San Diego, Las Vegas and New York in their efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. D.C. had more than 400 opioid-related deaths in 2020, or 34.7 deaths per 100,000 people, compared to the national average of 14.6 deaths per 100,000.
Last week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a Narcan nose spray as an over-the-counter drug, set to be available for purchase by the end of the summer.
Naloxone, or Narcan, is a medication that “rapidly reverses” an opioid overdose and is the standard method of reversing overdoses, according to the National Institution of Health.
DC Health partnered with Family and Medical Counseling Services and HIPS in October 2021 to implement “harm reduction” vending machines around the District, according to the release.

Six presidential candidates took the floor for over an hour, and two vice presidential candidates sparred in a separate debate.
Student Association candidates gathered Tuesday in a bid to convince students that they’re the right fit for student leadership at the annual SA debate.
More than 50 people at the Elliott School of International Affairs attended to hear SA presidential and vice presidential candidates debate their proposed policies ranging from improving graduate student engagement with the University to fair funding for student organizations. Six presidential candidates took the floor for over an hour, and two vice presidential candidates, Senate Chairperson Pro Tempore Demetrius Apostolis and SA Treasurer Arya Thakur, sparred in a separate debate.
Erika Filter, The Hatchet’s student government editor, moderated the vice presidential and presidential debates.
Presidential Debate
Six presidential candidates proposed their solutions to issues like a lack of graduate student involvement and a perceived dearth of funding for student organizations across campus. 
SA Sen. Rami Hanash Jr., GWSB-U, emphasized increasing outreach and connection with graduate students as one of his main platform points. He said he spoke with multiple senators from a variety of graduate schools on campus and they expressed “similar concerns,” like a lack of awareness for events students can participate in as well as limited knowledge on the resources graduate students have access to. He said if elected, he will invite graduate students to University-wide events.
Hanash also discussed his support for separating the Joint Elections Commission, which organizes SA elections, from the SA, and said elections for JEC members should be “fair,” as opposed to the current system where the SA president appoints members of the JEC. He also said members of the JEC should be elected in a “respectable manner” so they have enough time to work.
“I don’t think that people involved in the Student Association should be allowed to influence elections,” Hanash said. “For example, allowing them to operate outside the SA is something that we should have done a long time ago.”
Former SA transportation secretary Nathan Orner said he plans to redesign the current student organization funding model to a new model where each organization would receive a base funding of at least $200. The SA denied funding to 12 student organizations in the last general allocations process.
Orner said under the current allocations system, organizations cannot sustain themselves with the budgets the SA provides, and he criticized the SA for “not doing anything about it.”
“When I tried to petition onto the ballot, I spoke with 385 people, and not a single one was very fond of the SA or what they did,” Orner said. “The SA spent $48,000 on their own operating budget while giving orgs hardly anything.”
Students pay a $3-per-credit fee that goes into the SA’s funds, and the SA is setting aside more than $500,000 for general allocations to students organizations.
SA Chief of Staff Keanu Rowe said he would use his power as president to appoint project assistants to communicate with organizations regarding finances and external revenue sources.
“Presidents can appoint an endless number of project assistants,” Rowe said. “I will do so and with that, I will delegate them to certain student organizations.”
Residence Hall Association President Arielle Geismar proposed increasing engagement between graduate and undergraduate students through housing, career center opportunities and programming. She also suggested off-campus housing workshops for graduate students to receive advice on finding an apartment.
“We’re making the assumption that grad students know where to go for off-campus housing, they know what to do, they know the kind of questions to ask,” Geismar said.
Former SA Senior Policy Adviser Edy Koenigs expressed her concern with both Disability Support Services and the Title IX office as a “big reason” for why she is running for SA president. She said students have conveyed that DSS is difficult to access, even after receiving support from a doctor, as well as dysfunctional interactions with Title IX which she cannot “stand by” and allow to occur.
“I’ve had so many friends have absolutely atrocious experiences with Title IX,” Koenigs said. “It directly impacts their experience and their ability to connect to GW and I know step by step how to get it done.”
GW Entrepreneurship Club Vice President of External Affairs Mohamed Redzuan Bin Mohamed Raffe said he chose to run for SA president because of his frustration as a student who struggled to get SA funding for the organizations he participates in, like the Entrepreneurship Club.
He said he believes in his policies because people he spoke to while gathering petition signatures expressed interest in his plans to reinstate a pass/fail grading system, provide adequate funding for student organizations and promise stability.
“I have no SA experience, and I feel like that’s one of my proudest talking points,” Raffe said. “I know what it’s like to be a regular student.”
Vice Presidential Debate
Apostolis said his main priority as vice president will be ensuring every student knows that he will be an educational resource for them.
“You can ask any first year in the Student Association or any first year today that’s asked to meet with me,” Apostolis said. “I’ve had multiple coffees. I’ve taken the time and I’ve been there for everyone.”
Apostolis said he plans to increase meetings with administrators and invite students to join him and provide input. He said he hopes to invite student organizations to “regularly scheduled” meetings between the vice president and administrators.
“I want to invite those student orgs to be a part of that conversation,” he said. “So we can be making sure that every student has a voice here.”
Thakur said his campaign is “unique” because he is unafraid to propose “seemingly unrealistic” ideas, like implementing a varsity football team at the University. He said he plans to reserve a pool of funding from the general allocations process every semester for multicultural student organizations who hold some of the “best” events at GW, but are “angry” at the financial committee’s processes because they do not receive fair funding.
He said he hopes students and the SA will “touch grass” and avoid infighting.
“There will be no internal drama with the SA, and we’ll be focusing on the students,” Thakur said.
