The lawsuit states some of Walton’s injuries were permanent and required "extensive" medical treatment and surgical procedures that have created financial, emotional and physical burdens.
A former patient is suing the University, the GW Hospital and the Medical Faculty Associates for medical negligence when he fell and injured himself during skull surgery rehab three years ago.
In a five-page lawsuit filed in the D.C. Superior Court Tuesday, Maurice Walton alleges health care providers at GW Hospital were negligent when they failed to prevent him from allegedly falling and incurring temporary and permanent injuries when he was walking out of the shower in his room. Walton is suing GW Hospital, the MFA and the University for $5 million, according to the complaint.
The lawsuit states Walton was admitted to GW Hospital in October 2017 to undergo rehab following a head injury that required open skull surgery. When Walton was walking out of the shower in his room the next month, he fell and injured his right hip, shoulder, neck, back and head, which led to “diminished physical and cognitive abilities,” according to the complaint.
“Plaintiff would not have fallen but for that the defendants, acting through their agents and employees, breached applicable standards of care,” the complaint states.
The lawsuit states some of Walton’s injuries were permanent and required “extensive” medical treatment and surgical procedures that have created financial, emotional and physical burdens.
Walton alleges that hospital staff failed to maintain and repair the shower where he fell and warn the then-patient to avoid using “a malfunctioning shower.” The lawsuit states staff also failed to implement and follow a “Fall Prevention” program and provide adequate staffing, nursing and medical care.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal, GW Hospital spokesperson Susan Griffiths and MFA spokesperson Barabar Porter did not immediately return requests for comment. Walton declined to comment, and his lawyer – James Taglieri – did not immediately return request for comment.

Officials presented a summary of findings from a Faculty Senate executive committee survey of faculty members who were involved in discussions for some of Provost Brian Blake’s major planning initiatives at a senate meeting Friday.
The initiatives include academic technologies and the centralization of information technologies, sponsored research support, an academic master plan and student enrollment. Most respondents said Blake presented little to no data to support his plans and did not follow their recommendations for changes to his plans.
Blake said in an email that senate representatives were nominated by senate executive committee Chair Arthur Wilson, the executive committee and chairs of various senate committees. He said he also added deans and professional staff related to the topic of the initiative, as well as students.
Blake suspended development of his academic master plan earlier this month after some faculty began a push to hold a vote of no confidence for him, citing a lack of faculty involvement in the planning.
Those involved in the academic master plan said the provost didn’t present any data to the group, though he appeared to have collected information on various departments’ return on investment that was not “shared broadly.” Respondents said Blake “entirely ignored” suggestions they made and the “communication of intentions of the plan was poor.”
“Suggestions made by respondents that the master plan evaluate research, use the available strategic planning documents, use valid metrics and others were entirely ignored,” the results state.
Blake’s academic technologies and IT reform involved the consolidation of GW’s technology offices into one shared-services model as part of ongoing budget cuts. Faculty involved with these efforts said Blake did not present data relevant to their committee and he did not follow most of the suggestions offered by committee members.
“The general perception is that IT services have been degraded during the transition and the results are very negative or at least that it has become measurably more difficult for faculty to get IT support,” the results of the survey state. “The actions by the provost also have undermined morale in the LAI team.”
Officials transitioned the University’s research model in August to a decentralized, pod-based model, which consolidates projects by subject area.
Those involved in the sponsored research support initiative said “few respondents” had the opportunity to offer suggestions to the provost and Blake did not present any data to the committees to support his plan and ignored committee members’ suggestions to keep survey research and analysis at the school level. They said he “promised” that he would not take “significant” actions without consulting committee members but implemented his plan without doing so.
“Operational effectiveness may be compromised, depending on school, or it may be too early to tell,” the results state. “GW lost valuable personnel in the transition.”
Respondents involved in Blake’s student enrollment efforts said he provided “comparative” data from previous years and enrollment targets, but he did not incorporate most of their suggestions into his actions. Some respondents said Blake’s actions did not conflict with what he told the committee, but others said they felt officials did not keep their promise to abandon efforts to decrease enrollment.
“Loss of revenue and necessary austerity measures had to be adopted due to lower enrollment,” the results state.

About 50 to 60 nursing students on GW's Virginia Science and Technology Campus have administered COVID-19 tests on campus to meet their clinical community hours requirement.
Three months after students in the School of Nursing began administering COVID-19 tests on campus, volunteers said the experience helped them develop a deeper understanding of the pandemic.
Paul Challan, a senior in the accelerated Bachelor of Science in nursing program, said fourth-semester nursing students have been able to administer COVID-19 tests at the Virginia Science and Technology and Foggy Bottom campuses since August. Nursing students said their volunteer work has provided them with valuable training for their future jobs and gave them insight into how the crisis affected their school community.
Challan said about 50 to 60 nursing students have participated, each for a two-week period consisting of about 72 hours. The two weeks of COVID-19 testing count toward students’ typical clinical community hours requirement, which can include conducting health screenings and administering vaccinations at community organizations, he said.
“We got a call saying ‘This would cut your vacation short, but you can knock out your clinical community hours beforehand,’” Challan said. “That continues to be an ongoing two-week rotation available for students to sign up if they want.”
Karen Drenkard, the associate dean of clinical practice and community engagement for the nursing school, is leading the testing center team at the VSTC, according to a University release about the program.
Challan said nursing students rotate between two stations, one for checking in patients with their ID, phone number and date of birth and one for administering the nasal swab test. He said the students are equipped with gloves, N95 masks and face shields.
He said building community within the accelerated nursing program, which covers all the material for a four-year bachelor’s degree in 15 months, has been especially challenging now that classes are conducted virtually. He said helping at the testing site filled that gap, enabling students to get to know each other.
“Being able to do something like this COVID testing center, for your fellow classmates, for your professors and your teachers, it in another sense brings you a lot closer,” he said. “It makes you feel that you are part of this larger health care system and that you have a role to play.”
Hannah Brenneman, a fourth-semester student pursuing an accelerated BSN, said helping out with testing allowed her to gain useful insight into how nursing has been affected by the pandemic for when she begins to work in the field in the next few months.
“We didn’t have class time to talk about COVID-19 besides little five-minute sections that teachers were able to put it in,” she said. “This helped tremendously in the sense that we were able to get an idea of how our community is affected, what we can do to help and what our role in nursing will be in the next few months when we actually get into the field.”
Brenneman said she was at first concerned about the risk of contracting the virus and infecting her family, but she quickly adapted to the safety protocol and became more comfortable working at the clinic.
“I have always appreciated the health care field, but obviously this has shown me the demand and how taxing it is on our nurses and all of our health care providers,” Brenneman said. “Everyone is doing what they can, and that can be really hard when you don’t really have all the answers and you are kind of just playing it day-by-day.”
Eugenia Rott, a fourth-semester student in the accelerated BSN program, said having to manage both COVID-19 testing and completing the required 168 hours of volunteering in a hospital setting has left her feeling fatigued.
“Having basically a full-time job as a full-time student really sucked because you had all your assignments to do and you had to go to the hospital at least three times a week while shadowing or working with a nurse to develop your own school,” Rott said. “A lot of my classmates said they felt very burnt out.”
Rott said the experience has improved her nose-swabbing skills because she’s needed to administer tests to people with many different nose types, including people who have a septum piercing or a nose ring.
“It sounds so weird, but I didn’t realize that there were so many different structures of the nose,” she said. “It makes sense once you think about it, but not everyone’s nose is built the same.”

Episodes of Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew's new podcast have centered on administrative law, the criminal justice system and environmental regulations.
Updated: Nov. 16, 2020 at 2:27 p.m.
GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew launched a podcast late last month to discuss issues facing the country surrounding the November 2020 election.
Matthew discussed topics like voting rights, police reform and the Supreme Court via Zoom with GW Law professors on the podcast, named “Testimony.” She said on the podcast, which currently has seven published episodes on SoundCloud each at about 30 minutes in length, that GW has some of the “best experts in the country” who study these issues, and she hopes the podcast will help educate people on social and legal issues.
She said seeing the impact of the work of law faculty in the “real world” during her first few weeks as dean inspired her to start the podcast.
“Not everyone is lucky enough to spend a semester in the classroom with our stellar professors,” Matthew said in an email. “The podcast offers insight into incredibly important and complex legal issues by top-notch experts.”
She said the first seven episodes of the podcast consist of interviews with law school faculty about “timely issues” and the impact of these issues on the 2020 election. Now that the election is over, she will focus on issues like health, climate change, criminal justice and the priorities of the next presidential administration, she said.
“The series has received a lot of positive feedback, and although the presidential election is over, I plan to keep the podcast going so that our faculty experts can continue to share valuable knowledge with the public,” Matthew said.
She said going forward, the podcast will be built on the pillars of impact, featuring faculty members whose work is “impactful and important,” and influence, focusing on faculty work in congressional hearings and discussing how their research impacts the law.
Kate Weisburd, an associate professor of law, said she “welcomed the chance” to talk on Matthew’s podcast because she has not been able to interact with her colleagues as often as she would during an in-person semester.
“We are so apart right now, everyone is sort of hungry for the opportunity to find points of connection and finds ways of being connected together, so I think having this podcast is a nice way of using connectivity between us right now,” she said.
On Weisburd’s episode from late October, she discussed topics like police reform, criminal law and grand juries along with Roger Fairfax, a research professor of law. She said the protests against police brutality this summer have created a need for people to think about the role that the criminal justice system plays in furthering issues of police violence and racism and how the system can be used to address those issues.
“There is a need for us to think about the criminal justice system, the criminal legal system, the ways in which it is furthering problems and the ways in which it can be used to address questions of inequity and injustice,” Weisburd said.
Jonathan Siegel, a research professor of law, appeared on an episode in late October called “Explaining the Administrative State” with law professor Richard Pierce to discuss why administrative law matters to the work of the government and its relevance surrounding recent Supreme Court appointments.
He said administrative law may sound like an “obscure” topic but is “important” because the federal government needs to go through a government agency to implement new regulations through organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency and to file taxes through the Internal Revenue Service.
Siegel said he was “happy” to talk about his area of expertise in administrative law and its relevance in the election when Matthew asked him to be on the podcast.
“I think people would enjoy it and learn something, and it would be good for people to hear,” Siegel said.
Siegel said he discussed with Pierce and Matthew how recent appointments to the Supreme Court, like that of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, have signaled that the court will make “big changes” about the law of government agencies in the future, like the president’s ability to fire heads of government agencies.
“You might say ‘government agencies, who cares?’” Siegel said. “It’s that this is how the federal government exercises its power and every aspect of how that operates can affect everyone in the country.”
Robert Glicksman, a professor of environmental law, said he discussed on his episode published prior to Election Day how issues of environmental regulation would be different if President Donald Trump or now-President-elect Joe Biden were elected in the 2020 presidential election.
He said the podcast would be “eye-opening” to a variety of listeners, like undergraduates and law professionals in other fields, to learn about the approaches different administrations might take to environmental regulation.
Glicksman said the law school is the “appropriate” place to discuss these issues since D.C. is at the center of governmental policy.
“The series is a terrific way of exposing people to the important work that members of our faculty are doing,” Glicksman said.

Jay Goff, the vice provost of enrollment and student success, said applications came in at a "slower" than usual clip in September and October, but application rates rose across most populations in November.
Officials said early applicant data for the next academic year shows GW is “on track” to meet the University’s enrollment models.
Jay Goff, the vice provost of enrollment and student success, said at a Faculty Senate meeting Friday that the number of applicants for next fall is “consistent” with national trends, and officials are developing new strategies to increase recruitment. He said officials saw “slower” early application levels in September and October, but November application levels are rising across “most populations.”
“New first-years and transfers should be right on track to hit the models in place,” Goff said.
He added that fewer students from China are applying so far.
The number of applicants for the Common Application has fallen 10 percent compared to this point last year while the number of Free Application for Federal Student Aid applicants is down 16 percent compared to this time last year, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.
Goff said admissions staff has been unable to conduct in-person campus tours for prospective students or visit high schools, so officials have increased virtual outreach efforts. The admissions office plans to conduct 1,300 virtual activities between September and December, he said.
“I believe we’re following best practices,” he said. “We’re trying experimental work for new virtual campus visit programs and referral programs – contacting alumni and friends of the University to refer students we need in the recruitment process.”
Goff said he has convened “small, tactical” groups to monitor real-time enrollment and admissions trends and recommend new strategies. Officials have also created a Rapid Response and Innovation team to make enrollment decisions as the pandemic persists, he said.
“We’re taking all data in and looking at how things look in the new market,” Goff said. “We just met and had our kickoff meeting last week, looking at the bigger picture pieces for the next five years and next year.”

The men's basketball team will square off against Duquesne and Massachusetts in the first two home games of the season.
The Atlantic 10 unveiled the men’s basketball conference schedule Tuesday, according to a press release. 
The Colonials will take part in six nationally televised A-10 games this season broadcasted on NBC Sports and CBS Sports, the release states. The release added that each team will have two bye dates worked into its schedule between Jan. 13 and Feb. 24, and the final weekend of the regular season, March 5 to 7, will be left open for makeup games. 
“The 2020-21 year will be a unique and challenging season due to the COVID environment,” A-10 Commissioner Bernadette McGlade said in the release. “Utilizing multiple bye dates, creating an open weekend at the end of the season and moving games into December was deliberately done to allow for maximum flexibility to ensure the safety of our student-athletes, teams and campuses.”
The Colonials’ conference schedule is set to begin on the road with a rematch of last year’s A-10 Tournament first round on Dec. 30. Fordham bested the Colonials all three times the two teams faced off last season.
GW will then head home to defend the Smith Center against Duquesne and Massachusetts. Last season, the Colonials split their two games with the Dukes and nabbed a 24-point victory over the Minutemen.
The team will then make a trip to St. Bonaventure before returning home to take on VCU. A season ago, the Bonnies and the Rams swept the Colonials.
GW will then hit the road for three straight games at Dayton, Rhode Island and George Mason from Jan. 17 through Jan. 27. GW will have a week between its meetings with Dayton and Rhode Island.
The Flyers and the Rams both topped the Colonials in 20-point-plus victories last year. GW knocked off George Mason twice last season, both times deciding the game by six points.
The Colonials are set to face the Flyers a second time, but the date and time are TBD.
Another meeting with Fordham is set to close out the month of January. The Colonials will have a weeklong break before taking on Saint Louis, who was projected to finish second in the conference. The Billikens stifled a GW comeback victory last season early on in A-10 play.
After facing the Billikens, GW will square up with the predicted No. 1 finisher in the A-10 – Richmond. The Spiders beat the Colonials in both meetings last season. The Colonials will then travel to La Salle, who also came out on top in the teams’ lone meeting last year.
The team will then play a pair of home games against Saint Joseph’s and St. Bonaventure on Feb. 17 and Feb. 21, respectively. The Colonials crushed the Hawks last season in a 16-point victory.
The squad will cap its home-and-away series with Duquesne and George Mason to round out the month of February. The Colonials will travel to Pittsburgh Feb. 24 and take on the Patriots Feb. 27 in its final home game of the year.
The conference schedule is currently planned to conclude March 2 with a trip to Davidson. The last time the two teams met, the game descended into a four-overtime slug match, but GW came out on the right side of a 107–104 win.
While GW’s nonconference schedule is still being finalized, the Colonials are set to face off South Carolina in the Smith Center Dec. 14. The Gamecocks had the nine-point advantage when the final buzzer sounded in their meeting last season.
GW, who was projected to finish No. 11 in the A-10, is set to open the 2020-21 season Nov. 25 at the Veterans Classic. The squad will take on Navy at noon.

Foggy Bottom's new ANC commissioners include a student, a retired U.S. Army general, a State Department employee and a real estate manager.
Updated: Nov. 17, 2020 at 1:59 p.m.
Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, four newly elected neighborhood leaders said they hope to combat homelessness and lead Foggy Bottom to a safe recovery from the pandemic.
Joel Causey, Yannik Omictin, Donna Barbisch and Adam Friend were elected to their first terms on the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission earlier this month. The trio said they will prioritize several issues that have recently weathered the Foggy Bottom community, including the pandemic, homelessness, traffic safety concerns and a lack of funding for small businesses.
Only three of the ANC’s eight commissioners ran for reelection this year, clearing five seats for new candidates and paving the way for a new direction for the ANC in the years ahead. The district that’s currently represented by senior James Harnett, which solely covers GW residence halls and University President Thomas LeBlanc’s residence, still remains vacant without any declared candidate.
Here’s what you should know about each newly elected commissioner:
Joel Causey
Causey, a real estate manager who has represented the District in planning the construction of Nationals Park and the Washington Convention Center, clinched victory for the ANC’s open 2A02 seat, which represents part of the West End between 23rd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Causey will succeed Commissioner Nicole Goldin.
Causey said his district’s biggest challenges include a loss of commerce due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a rise in the number of individuals experiencing homelessness, who need more mental health support, he said.
“The homeless population has gone up exponentially in our ANC here,” Causey said. “That is something that we need to jump ahead of, and we need to give these people help.”
Causey said his main goal as a commissioner is to serve his constituents, including students who live in off-campus apartments in his district.
“There are a lot of GW students that come here, fall in love with D.C., move a block or two and get an apartment or condo or land a really nice job at a nonprofit or some government agency,” Causey said. “There are people that are coming here, and a lot of them are staying. I want more input from GW, so we can see what GW needs.”
Yannik Omictin
Omictin, a senior and the Student Association’s vice president for government relations, will fill Commissioner and GW alumnus Patrick Kennedy’s current seat, which borders the White House and includes Thurston and Mitchell halls.
Through his own attendance at ANC meetings, Omictin said he identified issues that needed more work in the community and created “ambitious goals” for the commission’s future, through which he hopes to craft a plan to curb homelessness in his district.
“There is a lot more that could be done to materially improve the lives of folks experiencing homelessness, protesters who might be passing through Foggy Bottom and students in Foggy Bottom,” he said.
Omictin said he is interested in supporting permanent supportive housing and expanded community input on encampment evictions to combat homelessness in his district. He said he also intends to hold police accountable for use of force to protect protesters and create a bicycle lane on 17th Street.
“It’s about why they’re here and treating them with the respect and dignity that they deserve,” Omictin said. “It’s just they don’t have the resources to make sure that they can stay safe and clean. The shelter system in this city is really lackluster, and that’s why they are out here.”
Donna Barbisch
Barbisch, a retired U.S. Army general who served for 38 years with experience in national security consultation and pandemic planning, will succeed former Commissioner William Kennedy Smith, who resigned earlier this year and represented the area around the Watergate complex.
Barbisch said she is focused on improving safety, security, traffic and streetscapes – the physical and visual environment of a roadway – in her district. She said she plans to address traffic congestion issues on Virginia Avenue and call for the opening of more restaurants near the Watergate Hotel to help support local community members.
She said she wants to host open meetings with her constituents on Zoom in hopes of improving communication with them and providing spaces where “people can voice their concerns.”
“People need to know they are heard,” Barbisch said. “That’s the most important thing.”
Barbisch said her top priority is to create a “strategic plan” through which the ANC will identify key issues that need to be resolved – like traffic hazards and homelessness – and then create a course of action for the next “five, eight or 10 years.”
“You have to start from today,” Barbisch said. “You cannot change yesterday, but you can always change today, and you can plan for tomorrow.”
Adam Friend
Friend, a U.S. State Department employee who works in the Office of the Special Envoy for the Coalition to Defeat ISIS, said he decided to launch a write-in campaign after hearing about the ANC’s vacant seat left by former Commissioner Detrick Campbell, who resigned this past summer. Friend said his plan to help local businesses prepare to adapt to social distancing guidelines during the winter will be “the biggest challenge” as he represents the north and east ends of campus.
He said he hopes to extend aid to local restaurants so they can use public space outdoors with provisions like tents to stay open with sufficient safety measures.
“The biggest challenge we’re facing right now is how to manage through the coronavirus, especially given that places are trying to reopen and adapt to circumstances with it getting colder and fixing up restaurants and shops,” Friend said. “I hope to be able to help them manage through it, help places reopen and help places stay open.”
Friend said he wants to see businesses operate more frequently with more hours in the future – an area he said his district lacked in before the pandemic. He also plans to create more “recycling opportunities” for the different groups of people who cross into his district.
“My overall goal is to keep the neighborhood safe, and my vision is to provide more for people who live here,” Friend said.
