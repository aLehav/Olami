The proposed White House budget released Monday slashes $15 million in funding to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for next fiscal year.
 The budget cuts will be taken from the annual $150 million that Metro receives through the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, which pays for long-term capital projects and maintenance, including escalator overhauls and track repairs.
“The Administration recognizes that WMATA must achieve progress in long-term capital reinvestment in the rail system and supports direct Federal assistance to accomplish priority investments for rail system safety and reliability,” according to the budget.
The Obama administration called the cutback in the budget “necessary given difficult fiscal circumstances” but said the overall transit funding plan would benefit the District and nation.
Metro chief spokesman Dan Stessel said Obama’s budget is a starting point but offers “recognition that we’re a system that is rebuilding.”
“We’re going to work very closely with the administration and the congressional delegation over the next several months to work toward full funding of Metro’s rebuilding effort,” Stessel said.
D.C., Maryland and Virginia are required to match the federal government’s funds doled out under the act to Metro.
Despite the proposed dip in funding for the transit authority, Metro General Manager and CEO Richard Sarles said in a release that the agency applauds the White House’s “continued support for Metro’s important safety improvements and capital program” to revamp tracks, signals, railcars, escalators and elevators.
Metro proposed fare hikes in January to mitigate its financial woes for next year’s operating budget, facing a $116 million shortfall.
Senator Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she will “fight to restore this funding that is essential to maintain a safe and reliable Metro system.”
“We must continue to invest in Metro to ensure that it is safe for the millions of people who ride on it every day,” Mikulski said.

“El Mundo o El País?” said the flight attendant, extending two newspapers out in front of me.
“The World or The Country?” I asked myself, not thinking much of it at the time. I noticed a man in business attire across the aisle reading El Mundo.
The world is larger, I justified. “El Mundo, por favor.”
At the time, I didn’t realize how profound the question actually was. As I plan trips to France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and the Czech Republic, I can’t help but wonder if I’m approaching my study abroad experience with the wrong perspective.
Madrid is both the largest and most populated city in Spain, and I could spend a lifetime here without ever leaving. So, as I look forward to the three months I have left abroad, I plan to follow this mantra: Think small, and you will get big results.
After all, the little things are what have had the strongest impact on me in Spain. I tasted the best coffee I’ve ever had at a tiny bar I only entered because it was the closest place to escape the freezing temperatures outside. On another occasion, I stared with amazement at a colossal Miró painting consisting of a simple line and somehow wanted nothing more. I travel via Metro almost every day, knowing I might walk through the sound of a bassoonist, an electric guitarist and an accordionist – some of the more ordinary performers I’ve encountered.
I’ve quickly learned that though I can’t get enough of Europe’s popular tourist attractions, the memories truly worth remembering are the ones you can’t photograph.
After eating churros con chocolate at the famed Chocololatería San Ginés, the taste of the thick, melted chocolate is now somewhat cloudy, whereas I can easily remember the sight of that elderly local slurping it down right out of the cup. Though the massive cross at El Valle de los Caídos amazed me in its sheer size, what really sticks out in my mind is when a Spaniard yelled at my friend for not eating a sandwich that had fallen on the ground.
They say time flies when you’re having fun, and my newfound appreciation for the little things in life has made that phrase ring true as ever. I make a point to apply this important lesson to the simplest moments of my day, in keeping with the European lifestyle. Rather than chug their coffee as if playing a game of caffeinated flip-cup, the Spanish allow the taste, aroma and warmth to sink in. Even at McDonald’s, they relax and converse on cushy swivel chairs. Instead of running to catch the train in the morning, they walk and catch the next one, arriving punctually the Spanish way: 15 minutes late.
There’s one thing I’m sure of – on my way back home, when the flight attendant asks me, “El Mundo o El País?” I’ll say, “Ninguno, gracias.” I would much rather stare out the window at Spain’s hazel-colored landscape, polka-dotted with olive trees.

If you play a word association game with “George Washington University,” chances are many will automatically answer with the word “expensive,” or some similar sentiment.
Indeed, for many years, the University was ranked as one of the most expensive private schools in the country. But it is this perception that University President Steven Knapp and the Board of Trustees have been trying to shed.
The University is committed to a fixed tuition plan, through which students who are enrolled at the University are guaranteed to pay the same tuition for 10 semesters. And any tuition increase for the incoming freshman class is typically tied to inflation like this year’s 3.7 percent increase for the Class of 2016.
And while there will certainly be complaints and grumbles from the community of another tuition hike, the University’s commitment to a fixed tuition plan that rises with inflation is extremely laudable.
Last year, the average tuition increase of private universities was 4.5 percent. And in a time of severe economic downturn, many private universities have had to drastically increase tuition – students entering the Class of 2016 at the University of North Carolina face an 8.8 percent hike.
GW has maintained tuition increases around 3 percent annually since the start of Knapp’s tenure, and the reason for the extra bump this year is to fund initiatives like the Career Services overhaul, which will directly benefit students.
So while the community may continue to criticize another tuition hike, it should be recognized that the administration is doing everything in its power to limit tuition increases as much as possible.
Nobody wants to see tuition increases. But students and their parents should recognize the sensitivity to cost of attendance that administrators are demonstrating, even during a time when it would be justifiable to abandon the current tuition model.

The University Counseling Center ushered in a new era with the resignation of Associate Director Barbara Brown last week.
Brown denied that her resignation is connected to the revelations about the supposed mismanagement, which led to high counselor turnover rates at UCC.
And while the true reason for Brown’s resignation many never be known, what is clear is that UCC can now start with a clean slate.
Although the University has taken action with its internal review of the counseling center, the outreach cannot stop there. Students, faculty and counselors should be consulted throughout the coming months as the search for a new director begins.
UCC is beginning to recover, but the University still has plenty of unfinished business to take care of to restore the reputation and stature of the center.

It has often been remarked that it is an ironic failure of justice that citizens in the capital of the world’s most powerful democracy are deprived of a voting voice in the federal government they host.
Yet there is a similarly disenfranchised class within the city that has little to no representation in D.C.’s government: college students.
Unlike the broader group of Washingtonians who are taxed without representation, we have the ability to collectively resolve our lack of representation.
D.C. Students Speak is committed to increasing civic participation among students in local universities. There are 85,000 college students in the District of Columbia, representing well over 10 percent of the city’s overall population.
Yet of the 276 Advisory Neighborhood Commission seats across the city, current college students occupy only two.
This should be particularly distressing for GW students, since there are no Colonials serving on the Foggy Bottom/West End ANC, despite students composing around half of the neighborhood’s population.
To get a seat at the table, we must step up as a group and become contributing members of the city’s vibrant civic community. Elected officials will only listen to students when we have established ourselves as visible, active and informed voters.
To that end, D.C. Students Speak will be conducting a city-wide student voter registration drive next week starting Feb. 27. I encourage all students to register to vote in the District, either through the drive or directly with the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics.
The election on April 3 in this city features a competitive Democratic primary for an at-large council seat and Republican presidential primary.
As a native Floridian, I know it’s difficult to give up the right to vote in a competitive state, which also has Senate and House elections.
But the intimate nature of District politics amplifies the importance of your vote, and the decisions made by D.C. officials will have a significant impact on your quality of life for as long as you attend school.
For that reason, I encourage my fellow students to band together so that we may give ourselves a voice in this great city.
Patrick Kennedy, a sophomore in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, is the president of the GW chapter of D.C. Students Speak.

A fundraising blitz by the Office of the Vice President for Research’s first development director hopes to make a proposed autism research center a reality.
The University has stayed committed to the autism and neuro-developmental disorder center since its conception in 2010, but Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa said the project cannot move forward unless newly hired Heather Russell can raise the capital for it.
Chalupa has said $10 million is needed to completely launch an autism research center, but University spokeswoman Jill Sankey said Tuesday that the development of a center could begin with a portion of that sum raised.
Chalupa said Russell, a former development director for the Texas-based Autism Treatment Center who started at the University last week, has a tough task ahead of her.
“The reason autism was targeted for raising money is because it’s expensive,” Chalupa said. “It’s very broad. It varies in everything from lab work with animals to human brain imaging to things like that. So it’s expensive.”
He has set a goal for Russell to raise $2 million to $3 million this year, which could get a lift from forging partnerships with private foundations, and continue fundraising over the next three to five years.
With 30 years spent raising funds to provide education and job opportunities for children and adults diagnosed with autism, Chalupa said Russell is the perfect fit for GW’s own autism enterprise.
“I’m excited to be on the ground floor on this. This is big, to say the least,” Russell said.
Inspired by an autistic student while studying special education as an undergraduate, Russell has since looked to development as a way to make more readily available the specialized programs that autistic patients require.
“It’s interesting how through the years the degree of separation people have to autism has been reduced. Almost everyone I speak to knows someone or has someone in their family,” Russell said.
Russell will also raise money to increase the number of undergraduate research fellowships available through the University as a way to encourage more interdisciplinary work like autism studies.
Since his arrival at GW in 2009, Chalupa has worked to carry out University President Steven Knapp’s goal of becoming a top-tier research institution.
If the University can raise money for the research center, Chalupa said finding space for it is another hurdle.
The center could be a signature focus of the $275-million Science and Engineering Hall, which opens in 2015, because the research would cross science disciplines, he said. Chalupa said he envisions a “brain floor” in the building that targets research and treatment initiatives for various brain disorders.
Forrest Maltzman, senior vice provost for academic affairs and planning, who sits on the Science and Engineering Hall’s space policy committee, said a autism research would be a good fit for the interdisciplinary-focused building.
“Certainly research on the autism spectrum involves interdisciplinary work. The [Science and Engineering Hall] is well-suited to centers involving both behavioral and biological research,” Maltzman said.
Valerie Hu, an autism researcher and biochemistry and molecular biology professor, said the research center plans have fallen behind because the University has yet to commit significant time or fundraising efforts to the project.
“Our original timetable for the initiative projected an existing GW autism institute by the end of 2010,” she said, adding that hiring a development officer is an important step in the right direction.
Laurie Alderman, an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Education and Human Development who specializes in autism research, praised GW’s commitment to developing the research center and its focus on autism.
“Something of this magnitude obviously does not happen overnight, but with the increasing numbers of children with autism in our country, the sooner the better,” Alderman said.

Talk of transferring seems to be an everyday topic of conversation among members of the freshman class. I’ve heard my friends, roommates and classmates discuss the option since my first month at GW.
Evidently the question, “to transfer or not to transfer,” primarily lives only in freshmen’s minds, because the retention rate at the University is higher than ever.
Yet even with this in mind, my fellow freshmen can’t seem to avoid the question.
Most freshmen I’ve spoken to aren’t necessarily unhappy with GW; they simply feel no connection to it. They have become comfortably situated in their individual groups, which seem to operate independently – and not as part and parcel of – the University.
Freshman year is about integrating and finding a place on campus, and even when students find their niches in small groups or student organizations, they still seem to feel alienated from the “GW community” at large.
As much as people stress that joining student organizations is the way to find your place on campus, this is not as easy as it seems. Freshmen already chose GW over so many other schools – now why do they have to choose a slice of the community? It can often be easier to consider leaving.
To create a community that welcomes freshmen as early as their first day, student groups must rethink their place at GW and realize they owe it to the University to consider community connection as a whole, in addition to the group development or recruitment of new members they strive for.
More collaboration among different groups and even more University-wide events should foster the community we need. Student groups must realize they are here because of GW; they all revolve around the same comically large bust of George Washington. Not the other way around. Perhaps then, freshmen will have fewer reasons to even consider transferring.
Freshmen should view themselves as not apprehensive outsiders trying to find a niche community, but as involved members of a larger community.
