The renovated coffee shop will vend Small Planes Coffee, a local District roaster. 
Buff and Brew, a renovated coffee house located in Ames Hall on the Mount Vernon Campus, opened Friday to all GW students.
Buff and Brew, a renovation of the Higher Grounds Café which previously operated in Ames Hall, offers coffee and tea drinks, kombucha and gelato. The new dining location is part of the ongoing transition to the University’s new dining plan, which will feature three all-you-can-eat dining halls on the Foggy Bottom Campus and a “redesigned” Pelham Commons, GW’s only dining hall during the past five years.
Karen Zinn, the associate vice president of real estate, said in an email in January that the University wanted to give students an improved coffee shop environment as part of GW’s efforts to improve the community and sustainability of dining on campus.
“At Buff and Brew, students and community members will enjoy a true coffee house experience in a relaxed setting, featuring a local Washington D.C. roaster Small Planes Coffee,” Zinn said in an email.

The Hatchet's student government editor, Lauren Sforza moderated the presidential debate, and GWTV's Capital Crossfire host Emmanuelle Dyer Melhado moderated the vice presidential debate. 
More than 30 people gathered to hear the Student Association’s candidates for president and vice president advocate for their platforms and pledge to increase transparency within the SA during Sunday’s debate in the University Student Center’s Continental Ballroom.
SA Sen. Dasia Bandy, ESIA-U, and senior and three-time SA presidential candidate Christian Zidouemba discussed their respective policies and how they hope to bridge the gap between the student body and the SA. SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U, and SA Sen. Alfredo Granados, ESIA-U, debated how their respective backgrounds working in the SA will help them accomplish their goals.
Six senate candidates took the floor to give short remarks on their platforms at the debate, calling for measures like improved academic advising accessibility, more dining plan options and greater affordability.
Emmanuelle Dyer Melhado, who hosts Capital Crossfire for GWTV, moderated the vice presidential debate, and Lauren Sforza, The Hatchet’s student government editor, moderated the presidential debate.
This year’s campaign reached record-low engagement levels as fewer senate candidates are running this year than in any of at least the five most recent elections.
In case you missed it, here are some of the highlights from the debate:
Presidential debate
Bandy and Zidouemba faced off on issues like increasing student engagement with the SA and accountability and were asked to defend some of their top policies.
Bandy said she plans to work with the University’s service carrier to improve GWireless on campus.
GW Information Technology – a department that underwent a series of layoffs during the pandemic – faced an influx of support requests in the fall due to a slew of layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bandy said amid record-low engagement in this year’s election, she plans to reignite engagement with the SA by holding a meeting with all student leaders on campus together during the first week of orientation.
“We need to start with what we have and the tools that are accessible to us, and the first tools that are accessible to us are our student leaders,” she said.
Zidouemba said he wants to collaborate with the Center for Career Services to consolidate resources particularly for freshmen and international students. He said he plans to use his platform as president to bring in high-profile members of organizations like Deloitte and the International Monetary Fund to hold more networking events.
“I remember vividly when I first got to The George Washington University, every time I asked a senior, ‘What’s your next move?’ the [answer] I usually get is ‘I don’t know,’” Zidouemba said. “To me, that’s everything when you pay $75,000 to go to The George Washington University.”
He said he plans to be available to students, should they have concerns about his work as president.
“If I get elected to become your president and you see I’m not doing something right, you have that obligation to come to my office or make a poster, rally your friends to be able to make those changes,” he said. “I think that’s one way to be able to make change in our university.”
Vice presidential debate
Xu discussed how his experience as SA finance chair working with student organization leaders and negotiating with administrators for more student organization funding has prepared him to advocate for students as vice president.
“By doing this job in a minimum level I must interact with all the administration,” he said. “That really brings me knowledge of how this university’s system works and how the bureaucracy works.”
Granados said the SA has lacked “effective outreach” to the broader student body and has instead been “drowned in an internal drama loop” with several lawsuits this year.
“I’m here as an advocate of the student orgs I have met with that have received the impact of its lack of effectiveness from funding cuts to regarding discrimination as an afterthought, and many other things that I can save because we have been affected by the actions and inactions of the Student Association,” he said.
Xu and Granados sparred over Granados’ absence at last week’s senate meeting, during which senators voted on three referenda – one to amend the SA Constitution to align with “current financial practices,” and two others asking students to expand the powers of the SA’s judicial branch and fill senate vacancies.
Xu said Granados missed the meeting for a “campaign activity,” and his presence at the meeting could have saved a referenda asking the student body to allow the senate to fill vacancies through special elections and appoint non-voting delegates from “underrepresented” groups, like freshmen on campus – which he said failed by one vote.
“I want to say that I’ll always be there for students and student organizations,” Xu said. “They know where to find me and I’m going to be accounted for being there for them.”
Granados said he was not at a “private rooftop party” as Xu implied but a “get together” with organizations like Black Student Union and GW Hillel to discuss initiatives he would work on if elected as vice president.
“It makes me really sad that we need to turn this personal, but I will respond to it,” Granados said.

GW's team was ranked fifth in the nation, a 20-place jump from last year’s ranking.
The Model United Nations team made a historic jump this year, achieving its highest fall national ranking in the history of the organization.
Best Delegate – a national Model UN organization that ranks all Model UN teams in North America – ranked GW’s team fifth in the nation, a 20-place jump from last year’s ranking after pandemic-related setbacks forced the team to miss virtual conferences and face substantial budget cuts from the University. Members of the organization said an increase in training sessions, national and international travel for conferences and a focus on team building through social events drove the team’s jump to the top five this year.
Amanda Saji, the president and head delegate of GW’s Model UN team, said the team reduced its number of leadership positions from 12 to three to unify and connect this team this year. She said the group also focused on recruiting a new freshman class of delegates that has consistently won individual gavel awards, including ​​the best delegate award, thereby contributing to the team’s success.
Saji said about 10 to 26 students attend each conference as delegates. She said more than half of the team’s delegation has consistently won gavels at conferences this year.
“​​My team is just amazing people and then my co-leadership board, they’re so smart and so talented,” she said. “And it’s a situation where we can all go, we’ll be in like tough committees, and we’ll still win awards and lead the team and I think it’s such a good example for everyone.”
She said each win that the delegation receives is based on a weighted point system. She said the points are weighted based on the competitiveness of the conference which is formulated on the number of delegates and schools that attend the conference.
She said the team traveled to more conferences this year and attended competitive conferences at the University of Pennsylvania and Boston University in the fall.
“​It is such a team effort and to be able to say we beat schools like Harvard and Yale, it’s so nice and rewarding,” she said.
She said all conferences turned virtual after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in the spring of 2020, but the group decided to not participate in the virtual conferences because they felt like they competed stronger in person and wanted to stick to what they did best. She said the decision to opt out of virtual conferences hurt the team’s scores, leading to a drop from seventh in the rankings to 25th.
“Being 25 really hurt us,” she said. “But then also, last year we were 25, this year we were fifth which is also the highest fall ranking we’ve ever received in the history of our team. So it was a good jump, it was definitely rough, but it was like the best thing that we could have ever asked for.”
Saji said the organization requested $37,000 this fall from the Student Association, but only received $4,956. She said the team is often “scrambling” before a conference to find the cheapest travel and hotel options to stretch their budget, still leaving students to pay $175 to attend each conference.
​​“We got literally nothing,” she said, “And I remember during the initial stages, we were so stressed, we’re like, ‘How are we going to make this work?’ And luckily we had money in the account, and things that we could do, but it’s an issue for future generations.”
She said it was a “miracle” that GW’s team was ranked fifth against well-funded teams. She said the team’s success and high rankings this year was because of a team “extremely dedicated” to winning.
“It’s really unfortunate because I really do believe GW MUN could be one – top one – one day,” she said. “It’s just, with the funding we have and the resources we have, it’s really hard to get there.”
Tommy Litchfield – a junior and the chair of the International Affairs Society, Model UN’s parent organization, – said the group will continue to train students and increase their conference attendance since the team has received increased attention from other Model UN programs who are looking to unseat GW’s team.
“Last year, all the conferences were online because of COVID,” he said. “So we only attended two conferences for the entire year. This year, we came back and Amanda had said we’d hit the ground running, we need to come in full force.”
Ananya Sampath, a junior and the chief of staff for Model UN, said the organization meets once a week in preparation for the conferences that have helped the team garner awards.
“We have amassed a lot of individual awards across the team that has contributed to our high ranking, with exceptional performances from a lot of the new members and the seasoned members continuing to perform very well in committees,” she said in an interview.

The Student Association is facing a crisis of confidence, with the community often feeling poorly represented by student leaders. This year, that could change. Both candidates for SA president brought enthusiasm for rallying students and advocating for their interests.
But one candidate brings a perfect fusion of passion and policy to the table. Students should vote for Dasia Bandy for SA president this year.
When the editorial board sat down with Bandy, she enumerated clearly thought-out principles and reasons for running, paired with actionable goals. Her experience as diversity and inclusion assembly chair in the SA is reflected in her platform because she lays out specific, actionable goals that will increase accessibility to a more well-rounded education for marginalized groups of people on campus. For instance, she wants to make the bias reporting system more public and accessible so that more students can use it to feel safer both in the classroom and outside of it. One way she plans to accomplish this is by advertising the bias reporting system so that more students know to use it when they need to.
Bandy also is interested in making everyday life easier for students. As president, she would advocate for increased printing and laundry funds and is interested in improving the strength of GWireless across campus.
In response to the incident in which a GW Teach professor said the N-word, which appeared in a painting she was showing the class, and the incident in which a student and a professor had an altercation over a student service dog, Bandy wants to expand diversity, equity and inclusion training for existing faculty members. These plans have specificity, actionability and build on existing efforts being undertaken on campus, which raises their odds of success.
Bandy is also interested in increasing accessibility for those with disabilities on campus. She plans to talk with Disability Support Services, administrators and students to talk about their current concerns with DSS and what they would like to see change about accessibility on campus in the coming year. This is the quality that makes her such a strong candidate for president and a promising advocate for students. She understands specific incidents and creates actionable plans to address the issues that caused those incidents to come up in the first place.
Beyond her plans, passion and experience, the single most important thing Bandy pledged to do is surround herself with a team that complements and supplements her knowledge. In every answer to the editorial board’s questions, Bandy not only talked about how she herself would approach a given issue, but how she would empower her team to advocate and lead. Knowing what you don’t know and bringing in a smart, diverse and capable team to fill in those gaps is important for any leader at any level. Not only will this help Bandy more effectively advocate for students, but it will give more people an opportunity to build skills advocating for their peers – in effect, this will help train the next group of potential SA leaders.
Bandy gave the editorial board a platform that she plans to enact if elected – but this platform was not made public until this past weekend when she posted her main points on Instagram. Making this platform public earlier would be an important way to demonstrate that she is eager for the community to see exactly how she is attaining her goals as SA president if elected – and it would be an important means of the community holding her and her team accountable.
The other candidate in the race, Christian Zidouemba, made a compelling and charismatic case for why someone outside the SA could shake up the institution. We feel that the next SA president needs to be able to take a two-track approach to making change: standing outside of the drama that has harmed confidence in the SA while also knowing enough about how the institution works to be able to advocate for students’ best interests. On that metric, Bandy comes out ahead.
Bandy has the plans, passion and people to be an effective SA president – students should cast ballots for her on March 29 and 30 and should hold her and the entire SA accountable to the promises they make.
The editorial board consists of Hatchet staff members and operates separately from the newsroom. This week’s staff editorial was written by opinions editor Andrew Sugrue and contributing opinions editor Shreeya Aranake, based on discussions with culture editor Anna Boone, contributing sports editor Nuria Diaz, design editor Grace Miller and copy editor Jaden DiMauro.

In addition to endorsing candidates for Student Association president and vice president, the editorial board also recommends how students should vote on referenda that are on the ballot in the SA elections. In past years, there have been hot-button referenda, from gauging student sentiment about fossil fuel divestment to approving a process to more expeditiously remove SA presidents who engage in bad behavior.
But this year, there’s only one on the ballot – a pair of minor SA procedural fixes that would simultaneously overcomplicate the student organization funding allocation process and allow incumbent senators to saddle their successors with a budget even after they have left office.
We urge students to vote no on this referendum.
The referendum would confirm a piece of SA legislation called the Financial Practice Act. If passed, potential increases to the Student Association fee would be put up to a nonbinding referendum for students, even though the University would have final say on whether or not the fee was hiked. SA funding seems like a spurious item to submit to the student body for approval. The whole point of a Student Association fee is to create a steady means of funding that does not rely on students chipping in voluntarily. This is an unnecessary step that has the potential to do little more than confuse students and make people angry about having to pay an SA fee at all – not an ideal outcome.
Passing this referendum would also enact a fix to the SA Senate budget process that would be, in the grand scheme of things, no big deal – it would eliminate the need for the budget to be voted on both by outgoing senators at the end of the academic year and new SA senators at the beginning of the year. Essentially, the budget that senators vote on when their terms are almost up would be the budget that their successors would be governed by. While in practice the new senate usually quickly approves the budget by voice vote, it does not seem like a good idea to let people who are leaving office saddle their successors with a budget on their way out the door. Students should vote down this referendum – but the consequences either way are fairly minimal.

The four-week long festival kicked off earlier this month. 
The National Cherry Blossom Festival is back in person and prioritizing accessible events following pandemic delays that pushed the quintessential festival to an online format the past two years.
Meg Cohen, the festival’s director of marketing and communications, said festival organizers drew on remote and hybrid events from the past two years to make this year’s celebration increasingly accessible and immersive. We spoke to a collaborating musician and visual artist who said they are eager and “honored” to participate in the festival through hybrid events and experiential artwork.
“People feel really hopeful, and I think right now, everybody wants that,” Cohen said. “It’s something fun and light and something that brings us together. Now more than ever, we really want that sense of unity.”
The four-week long festival kicked off earlier this month, with events ranging from kite-making workshops to art exhibitions. Now that the cherry blossoms are in bloom, you can still look forward to the dozens of events to come, like the Japanese Street Festival and the classic National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade.
Cohen said one of the events to stick around from last year’s hybrid format, which accommodate COVID-19 guidelines, is Art In Bloom, a giant cherry blossom-themed scavenger hunt with statues placed all around the District.
She said in addition to continuing the outdoor scavenger hunt, the festival will put on a two-week-long Petalpalooza Art Walk of 10 “immersive” installations. The walk will display new interpretations of the blossoms across the Capitol Riverfront neighborhood, like Blossom Gazebo, a large, immersive sculpture that visitors will be able to step inside.
“We know that especially with COVID, everybody’s at a different place,” Cohen said. “Everybody has varying levels of comfort, but what we hope is unanimous is that everybody wants to celebrate spring and these beautiful blossoms.”
Cohen said one of the festival events, The Japanese Street Festival, is the largest celebration of Japanese culture in the country and will return for two days this year for its 60th anniversary. This street festival will offer activities like a culinary arts stage and sake tasting for visitors to experience Japanese culture.
Cohen said the festival will introduce “A Pop of Spring,” a new event in partnership with the DowntownDC Business Improvement District where guests can enjoy live entertainment, support local vendors or relax in swinging table benches, offering a similar atmosphere as D.C.’s reoccurring Downtown Holiday Market.
Yumi Kurosawa, a Brooklyn-based Japanese koto performer and composer who is performing at the festival, said she was originally slated to perform in a concert celebrating Japanese painter and calligrapher Tomioka Tessai before the onset of the pandemic.
She said she created a special ensemble blending Japanese and Chinese instruments to honor Tessai, whose work was influenced by Chinese art, and perform at a festival event in collaboration with the Freer Gallery of Art next week.
“It took me a little time to decide what kind of music I have to arrange and compose music for this ensemble, but it was very fun,” Kurosawa said. “And also this concert program music was inspired by Tomioka Tessai, so I also went through his life journey, and that was a really interesting process.”
She said the trio will perform some of her original new music commissioned by the gallery, as well as famous Japanese songs and Chinese music.

“I decided to do Japanese songs including Chinese instrument ensemble and Chinese songs including Japanese and Western ensemble,” she said. “So that’s already blending different cultures and elements, which I love, like a cosmopolitan type of ensemble.”
Lea Craigie-Marshall, the official artist of this year’s festival, designed the festival’s official artwork, including the kites at last weekend’s Blossom Kite Festival and the cherry blossom-themed Metro card available for purchase at the L’Enfant Plaza and Navy Yard Metro stops.
She said she collaborated with the festival at last year’s scavenger hunt when she presented Crane’s Dance, a sculpture inspired by the Japanese fabled belief that cranes carry souls to heaven, representing the lives lost to COVID-19.

Craigie-Marshall said her gazebo at the Petalpalooza Art Walk will allow visitors to step inside the work and supply a bench for meditation. She said the piece, which is a 3D version of her original artwork for the festival, provides a “sensory experience” for guests to immerse themselves in.
She said the Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant sculpture offers sensory stimulation like wind chimes, lights and the scent of cherry blossoms to ensure her sculpture was physically accessible to every participant.
“The whole festival is so accessible,” Craigie-Marshall said. “There’s so many different options that I feel like everyone is welcome and everyone’s able to enjoy it.”
She said as part of the Art Walk, she will also invite guests to live paint a paint-by-number cherry blossom sculpture with her at Petalpalooza on April 16.
“It’s just going to be really lively,” she said. “That’s what I wanted my art to be this year since we are back in person, finally able to be together. I think it should be a celebration.”

Joutz's colleagues in the economics department said they will remember him for his kindness he showed to his students and coworkers. 
Fred Joutz, an economics professor and the former co-director of a research program focused on forecasting economic trends, died from cancer last month after more than 30 years at GW. He was 68.
Joutz started teaching at the University in 1988 and became the co-director for the H.O. Stekler Research Program on Forecasting in 2000, where he researched economic forecasting and energy modeling. Joutz’s loved ones described him as a kind, funny and intelligent person who could energize a room full of people.
He received more than 10 awards and fellowships for his work in international energy economics, including the University’s PRIDE Teaching Award, the Federal Forecasters Conference’s Best Paper Award and the STAR Research Award from the Environmental Protection Agency, during his career.
Joutz was born in D.C. in 1953 and was raised in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Joutz earned a bachelor’s degree in international economics from the University of Maryland in 1979, a master’s degree in economics from the University of British Columbia three years later and a doctorate degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1987.
After completing his education, Joutz returned to the DMV and started instructing at GW in 1988. He had four children – Andre, Marguerite, Dmitri and Ivan – in the following years, and Joutz lived in the DMV for the rest of his life.
Joutz’s daughter, Marguerite, said he was “one of a kind” and a loving parent who was the “life of the party” and the energetic person people were drawn to.
“He asked you questions, and he remembered things and maybe you saw him at a party six months ago, and then you’d see him again – he would remember what you had talked about and would pick up the conversation like nothing had happened,” she said.
She said at the start of the pandemic, Joutz hosted a weekly barbecue with his three sons in his home in Maryland, which was the highlight of all their weeks.
“I think we also had the benefit of really getting to spend time with our father as adults as the people who we’ve become to sort of, in some ways, get to know each other or really get to know each other better,” she said. “And so, he just loved spending time with us.”
Faculty in the economics department said they will remember Joutz for his eagerness to help his students and his kindness toward his colleagues.
Tara Sinclair – a professor of economics and international affairs who served as Joutz’s co-director of the economic forecasting research program before succeeding him as sole director – said Joutz was “the heart and soul” of the program.
Sinclair said he connected students across the globe in Europe, Africa and Asia with mentors and gave them advice on how to succeed and advance in economics studies.
“Fred’s wide-ranging interests connected him with students from Central Asia, institutes in the Middle East and governments in Africa,” Sinclair said in an email. “One of Fred’s defining features was that whenever there was a student or colleague in need, Fred was always jumping in to help.”
Sinclair said Joutz was an “incredibly generous and warm” person who focused on helping junior faculty and improving student life during his time at GW. He said Joutz worked intermittently in economic consulting while serving as a full professor at the University, and he donated his consulting paycheck to the economics department for student scholarships and department funding.
“Everything was always through the lens of how will this help the students, and so that was just really inspiring as well,” she said. “And I think something, a mark, that he’s left on on all of us.”  
Stephen Smith, the chair of the economics department, said he saw a large number of attendees at the memorial service for Joutz held earlier this month at Garrett Park Town Hall in Maryland. He said Joutz requested that his memorial service would be a “celebration of life.”
“At the memorial service, it was great to see such a large turnout of our colleagues,” Smith said in an email. “And it was wonderful also to see scores of people from beyond GW who I didn’t know all sharing the same sense that Fred was one of the kindest people we had ever met.”
Anthony Yezer, a professor of economics, said when he and Joutz coached a youth baseball team that their sons played on together for a few years, he saw how great Joutz was at working with young people.
“Trying to get 12- and 13- year-old boys to play baseball can be a little bit challenging because it’s a difficult game, and they get frustrated and he is extremely good at working with youngsters,” Yezer said.
Roberto Samaniego, a professor of economics, said Joutz was a “warm colleague and kind soul” and would often welcome colleagues and students into his office with pretzels from a barrel he kept in his office.
“I remember how when I joined GW he reached out to support me personally and in my career in many ways without me asking,” Samaniego said in an email. “That was the kind of person he was.”
Joann Weiner, a professor of economics, said she was grateful for Joutz’s work with GW’s applied economics on forecasting for graduate students.
“He made a difference in their time at GW,” she said.
Maggie Chen, a professor of economics and international affairs, said Joutz was an “amazing” economist, professor and colleague.
“He would always go above and beyond to help his students and colleagues and make everyone feel welcome and included,” Chen said in an email. “His warmth, humor and energy will be forever missed by all of us.”

The Grammy's air on Sunday, April 3 at 8 p.m. on CBS. 
Clear your schedule Sunday night to see some of your favorite artists recognized at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, airing at 8 p.m. on CBS.
We asked our staff which Grammy-nominated songs, albums and artists they are rooting for this upcoming awards show. From Olivia Rodrigo’s breakout pop album “SOUR” to Bo Burnham’s musical comedy special “Inside,” these are the nominees The Hatchet’s staff is behind:
“Family Ties” by Baby Keem 
Best Rap Song
Tiffany Garcia | Managing Director
This year marks Baby Keem’s first Grammy nomination, and it is well deserved. The 21-year-old’s entire discography, including 2021’s fan favorite album “The Melodic Blue,” has been defined as pushing the boundaries in rap.
Keem first made waves in 2019 with the release of “Orange Soda,” his first song to enter the US Billboard Hot 100. But 2021’s “Family Ties,” in collaboration with his cousin Kendrick Lamar, elevated the rapper’s status even further as an instant banger. Keem’s skill in lyricism and experimenting with different instruments in his beats is evident in every song, even as a fairly new artist on the scene. I’ll be crossing my fingers for him on Sunday.
“SOUR” by Olivia Rodrigo
Album of the Year
Zach Blackburn | Metro Editor
Olivia Rodrigo’s debut album SOUR dominated pop culture and smashed streaming records last May, and rightfully so. With standout lyrics like “God it’s brutal out here,” the breakout album is an angsty and authentic collection of teen pop anthems.
Many of the album’s songs offer different perspectives of a breakup, from vengeful bops like “good 4 u” to the sad ballad “drivers license.” Rodrigo hops between genres masterfully, exuding alt-rock vibes in “brutal” while also slowing down the tempo for songs like “1 step forward, 3 steps back.” If SOUR is any indicator, Olivia Rodrigo will be a star for years to come.
“El Ultimo Tour del Mundo” by Bad Bunny
Best Música Urbana Album
Nuria Diaz | Contributing Sports Editor
In the Musica Urbana genre, Bad Bunny’s album “El Ultimo Tour del Mundo” is his sixth grammy nomination and could help him claim his second Grammy for reggaetón artist. The album combines classic Spanish rock with the new Urbano movement of the island while also paying tribute to the traditional music he grew up with, as in “Cantares de Navidad.”
The album rose through the ranks to gain the first No. 1 Spanish album on the Billboard charts and led Bad Bunny to become the most-streamed artist on Spotify. “El Ultimo Tour del Mundo” not only represents the influence Bad Bunny has gained over the genre, but a new experimental phase for the reggaetón genre.
“Planet Her” by Doja Cat 
Album of the Year/Best Pop Vocal Album
Molly Kaiser | Contributing Social Media Director
In polarizing times, I think there’s one thing we can all agree on: Doja Cat’s third studio album, “Planet Her,” makes everyone want to shake their ass. Her lyrics and artistic style may be raunchy to some, but hits like “Woman,” “Get Into it (Yuh),” “Need to Know” and “Kiss Me More (feat. SZA)” are undeniably bangers.
But “Planet Her” is not only filled with my favorite songs to listen to on the treadmill and during a night out but also some unexpected soulful R&B beats like “Been Like This” and “Alone,” and the melodic and other-wordly track “Love To Dream,” which demonstrates the rising artist’s musical range and talent. The album oozes girl power and differentiates itself by centering ethereal femininity, making it more than worthy of a Grammy win for Best Album.
“Inside” by Bo Burnham 
Best Music Film
Anna Boone | Culture Editor
Last summer, during the deceptive pandemic lull before the Delta variant surge, Bo Burnham’s self-produced feature “Inside” reminded us of the unhinged and unbearable year we had just experienced. Burnham melded his knack for filming with his lyrical comic talent in this hour and a half Netflix special.
The feature includes 21 of Burnham’s original songs, which range from the light-hearted and witty “White Woman’s Instagram” to “That Funny Feeling” and “Goodbye,” which explore darker themes and strike more poignantly. Burnham filmed all of the feature’s content during a time he was admittedly struggling with mental health, which characterized the piece with a self-actualized dark comedic tone. Winning a Grammy seems like something Bo Burnham would satirize, but I think he deserves it.

Try Ted Bulletin's Ted Tart and Mini Pie to celebrate blossom season. 
If there’s one thing people living in D.C. obsess over, it’s all things cherry blossom, and luckily, small businesses around the District are showcasing an abundance of blossom-inspired desserts for you to try this season.
The beautiful pinkish flowers adored by D.C. residents and tourists alike will be gone by late April, so take advantage of the various cherry blossom sweets and treats being served around the city. We’ve compiled a list of confections you should be sure to try before you have to wait another year to see the blooms again.
Olivia Macaron 
Cherry blossom macaron
Located just off M Street, Olivia Macaron exclusively sells the classic French pastry, macarons. The store carries 16 flavors daily, some of which rotate seasonally, and this spring’s specialty flavors include cookies & cream, mint chocolate, lemon meringue and cherry blossom.
The cookies of the cherry blossom macaron are tinted an eye-catching light pink color with a thick and tart jammy fruit filling. You can eat this treat in two bites, so consider grabbing more than one.
Bindaas 
Cherry kulfi dessert
For a cherry-infused Indian meal, stop by Bindaas in Western Market. For your entree, try out the chicken berry paulo ($16) an aromatic basmati rice pilaf with cashews, caramelized onion, saffron and dried cherries.
But save room for the cherry kulfi ($9) dessert, which is a traditional frozen Indian dessert resembling a popsicle, with a spiced cream base. The cherry kulfi is topped with cherry sabayon, an egg yolk and alcohol-based foamy cream, sweet saffron noodles and pistachios.
Ice Cream Jubilee 
Cherry blossom floral flavors
This local D.C. ice cream shop-turned national chain was founded by a former presidential appointee at the Department of Homeland Security who quit her job to pursue her passion for ice cream.
This spring, you can try four floral-inspired flavors: blackberry chamomile, orange blossom tea cake, raspberry rose and smoked vanilla cherry sakura. The smoked vanilla cherry sakura is inspired by the blossoms of the season and infused with lapsang souchong tea from Teaism and swirled with cherry preserves from Whisked! bakery.
District Doughnut 
Cherry blossom donut
One of D.C.’s most popular donut chains, District Doughnut, will sell its spring menu through May 22. This gives you plenty of time to try an assortment of the 14 flavors on this season’s menu.
Donuts like the lemon poppy seed, strawberry coconut and blueberry glazed scream spring with their bright and fruity flavors. But you can’t leave without the cherry blossom donut ($4) with a vanilla bean dough, cherry pie filling, cream cheese glaze and a pie crust crumble.
Ted’s Bulletin 
Cherry blossom dessert line
For a variety of cherry blossom dessert options, head to Ted’s Bulletin on 14th Street, its closest location to campus. This American fare restaurant is well-known for its gourmet “pop-tarts,” which the restaurant had dubbed Ted’s Tarts.
You can try out the cherry blossom Ted Tart ($4) or sample a few of its other cherry blossom options like the cherry blossom cheesecake ($8), sour cherry reduction, cherry compote and dried rose flowers. Or try the cherry blossom churros ($8) with chocolate sour cherry dipping sauce, cinnamon sugar and dried flowers.
Georgetown Cupcake
Cherry blossom and cherry cheesecake cupcakes
This once TV-famous bakery may not be as trendy among locals, but you shouldn’t overlook its extensive spring cupcake collection featuring two cherry-centric cupcakes.
In addition to Georgetown Cupcake’s everyday classic cupcakes, the bakery sells a seasonal menu that changes monthly. April’s menu features a cherry blossom cupcake ($3.75), a madagascar vanilla cake baked with cherries with a cherry-infused cream cheese frosting and a fondant cherry blossom decoration. Or you can try the cherry cheesecake cupcake ($3.75) with a graham cracker crust, a cherry infused frosting and cherry blossom fondant decoration.
