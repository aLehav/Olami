A change to the online account systems will give parents and guardians access to student records, a technical shift that will make it easier for parents to directly manage their students’ finances.
Changes to the University’s online information portal will allow students to grant four additional users varying levels of access to their accounts, which display grades, cost of attendance, financial aid awards and class schedules. Each user will have a unique login and password to the system.
David Steinour, chief information officer in the Division of Information Technology, said the University hopes to roll out the changes by this fall.
Parents cannot currently see student data on GWeb, which means students sometimes must act as middlemen between University offices and their parents, Dan Small, associate vice president for financial assistance, said.
“We have found over the years that when a parent or guardian was in contact with one of these offices, the parent may not have had the same information accessible to the student,” Associate Vice President for Financial Assistance Dan Small said.
With the new access to information, Small said parents will be better informed about an issue or concern when reaching out to a GW office, saving time for staff and families.
“We hope the dialogue between the student and parent will be enhanced and the overall communication with all parties improves,” Small said.
Staff members from the Registrar, Student Accounts and Student Financial Assistance and the Division of Information Technology collaborated in the months-long effort to bring broader access. Steinour declined to specify what prompted the group to pursue the upgrade now, which will have no cost, but he said the student accounts office had long “expressed interest in enabling features that would allow parents access to student records online.”
Senior Vice President for Student and Academic Support Services Robert Chernak said the expansion of access hopes to strengthen ties with parents.
“When you’re in high school, your parents have access to everything. As soon as you go to college, your parents have access to nothing,” Chernak said. “There are a lot of parents who still take care of their students, and we want to support them to do that.”
As plans are finalized, the University must check its compliance with the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act, Chernak said. The legislation spells out rights for students and parents in sharing personal information, specifically mentioning that colleges that receive federal funding cannot grant parents access to their students’ information without permission.

Mike Lonergan hates losing.
He hated losing at the beginning of the season, before the Colonials took the court. He hated losing throughout the year, as GW saw skids mount to multiple games before they were able to add a tally to the win column. And he’s still vocal about how much he hates losing after his team’s season ended in the first round of the A-10 tournament at Dayton.
But the good news about losing, he admits, is that it provides an incentive to make a statement.
“I’ve lost before. But it makes winning more satisfying and more fun. I hope I never have a season like we did – record-wise and losing close games – because I’m not used to losing close games. It hurt. It still hurts,” Lonergan said. “But I try to focus on all of the good things going on around our program and in the athletic department. And there are a lot of good things going on.”
As Lonergan sits in his office, glancing through the windows that look across the street to the Smith Center, it is clear his mind is still on the court. The season might be over but the head coach’s work isn’t. His desk is piled high with papers, his phone is buzzing and around him, his staff is providing updates on their recruiting prospects.
Though the Colonials’ season ended with a disappointing 10-21 record, athletic director Patrick Nero sees a promising future in the foundation being laid behind the scenes.
“Our goal, ultimately, was to build a program that can compete in the NCAA tournament year after year. And that’s going to take four or five years,” Nero said. “I’m going to be patient, I know it drives [Lonergan] nuts, he wants to win every game, that’s his personality.”
Key factors in their calculations are the incoming recruits, the players who will form the true future of the program. The Colonials will have at least five new bodies next year: Villanova transfer Isaiah Armwood and incoming recruits Kethan Savage, Patricio Garino, Joe McDonald and Kyprianos Maragkos. The recruits represent “the mix that we want,” Nero said, with three talented local players and two international students.
With next season’s incoming recruits, Lonergan aims to solve what he believes was one of the program’s biggest Achilles’ heels: its lack of depth.
“You looked down the bench and just didn’t have a lot of options. Good teams usually have a lot of competition in practice and for playing time, and we really didn’t have that,” Lonergan said. “Subconsciously or not, guys knew they were going to play, and it was just harder, when they were having a rough night, to really hold them accountable.”
Lonergan sees room for many of the Colonials to make significant strides in their play­, but he is also hopeful that the incoming players will challenge their teammates for time on the court. Next season, he will lose Tony Taylor – a point guard who oft carried the team during his tenure – to graduation, and Lonergan potentially sees junior guard Bryan Bynes competing with incoming recruits for the starting slot.
“My hope is Isaiah will be a starter and then maybe two of the returnees will start. We’ll probably end up starting a couple of freshman,” Lonergan said. “But we’ll have more depth, just because we’ll have more bodies and guys that are talented players.”
The current players are now taking time to rehab from the season and prepare for next year. Lonergan said junior forward David Pellom underwent successful meniscus surgery on his left knee last week, after playing through injury this season. Bynes is taking time to rehabilitate his left shoulder after struggling with injury over the year, Lonergan said.
An NCAA rule change will allow greater summer access for training, granting programs the ability to have student-athletes complete eight hours of athletic activity a week, up to two of which can be skill-related instruction. In addition to that, the Colonials will receive 10 full practices to prepare for their five-game trip to Italy in August, an opportunity that Nero and Lonergan hope will afford the team benefits in skills and in chemistry.
“What I like to do is almost break them up and assign them so that they’ll be spending time with different teammates. So not only will you get to know them on the basketball court, but all of a sudden you’ll be spending 10 days in a foreign country with teammates you’ve never spent time with before,” Nero said. “Maybe switch up their roommates on the road, that type of stuff, so they bond a lot quicker rather than waiting until early September.”
Strong chemistry will remain important as the Colonials stare down another tough schedule for next season. VCU, Notre Dame and Kansas State are among the programs already on the books for next season, and both Lonergan and Nero said that additional high-profile opponents are in the works. Playing a tough schedule, they agreed, is good for the program, both in preparing its players for the A-10 and in bringing new bodies into its ranks.
“We want to play a schedule every year that if we have a team that is playing at the level, that they could be invited to the NCAA. We never want our schedule to hurt us,” Nero said. “If we don’t make the tournament, it’s because we’re not good enough. And this year is a good example. We played a schedule that if we were good enough, there was no way we would not be in the tournament.”
And so, even though the season is done on paper, in many ways, Lonergan and Nero feel that the work is just beginning. This year was just one step in rebuilding the program – a disappointing step, Lonergan allows – but not one that dissuaded his belief in GW’s ability to reach its former heights.
“I still believe more than ever that we can be successful here,” Lonergan said. “I almost felt after the season ended like I did last May 3, when I started.”

Since freshman Zoe Pierce was diagnosed with dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in high school, it’s been a struggle to find teachers and classmates who could empathize with her schoolwork troubles.
It wasn’t until she was working with high school students who have learning disabilities in a new special education course at GW that she discovered she had the ability to provide the support system she rarely had.
“I was talking with [one of] the students, and she asked, ‘Does it get better?’ ” Pierce said. “I remember sitting in a classroom and asking that same question. For the ones that push themselves and have people to help them, it does.”
Ten undergraduates have come face-to-face with students in special education programs in high schools across the D.C. area for first time this semester, and are working as mentors for the high schoolers’ transition into the adult world.
The course – geared toward psychology and human services majors – is co-taught as part of the Career Investigations for Transitioning Youth program by professor Juliana Taymans and research assistant Lindsey Anderson in the Graduate School of Education and Human Development’s special education and disability studies department.
While the CITY program is in its fifth year at GW, this is the first semester it paired students with high school students who have disabilities.
With the help of their mentors, the high school students will link up with departments at the University to shadow jobs, allowing the participants to gain career experience. The students might follow a librarian who shelves and checks out books, for example, or learn how to process mail at package services. The hope is that successful job shadowing will lead to long-term internships, Taymans said.
One of the challenges of the shadowing process is educating employers about the students who will be working with them, senior Mario Grant said. Students met with each employer to share background on the high schoolers’ disabilities to ensure that the work they will be doing at each site is appropriate.
“Once they have exposure, they can recognize what a field requires them to do,” Grant, who worked with students from Anacostia High School, said. “That will help them get some more perspective on what they’re interested in.”
For senior Dhiren Shetty, whose 24-year-old sister is developmentally delayed, the course has hit home.
“As my sister got older, I learned about the difficulties she’d encounter in the real world,” he said. “We often think that people with disabilities have a hard time or that they’re not going to college. But from the experience I’ve had [in this class], the students aren’t much different from us.”
School districts across the country have struggled with shortages of special education teachers for decades, and full federal funding has languished for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, shifting costs for special education to states and school districts. A 2008 Department of Education report showed an 11.2 percent gap in the supply of highly qualified special education teachers.
“Nationally, we need to pay more attention to that,” Pamela Leconte, the coordinator for GSEHD’s Transition Special Education Master’s Program, said. “We’d like to see the CITY program replicated with other universities. The more people we can get to do that, the better.”
While the graduate school, which was ranked No. 42 by U.S. News & World Report this month, has always zoned in on special education, the undergraduate component was an added bonus, Leconte said.
“I like that the class helps find a home for the CITY program,” Anderson added. “There’s now a small community of people who recognize the importance of supporting students with disabilities. It’s an opportunity for these students to have mentors and role models.”
The course has had the same effect for some students. Senior Ashley Gomez’s goal has always been to work as a child therapist for abused minority children, but said the course has expanded her job aspirations.
“Now, with the positive feedback I’ve gotten from Dr. Taymans about my work, I can feel myself starting to expand my idea of what my career will be. Maybe I’ll look into special education,” Gomez said.

The University’s financial office said last week it will increase the estimated cost of attendance by $50 next fall to better account for personal fees.
After a yearlong focus on fees by top student leaders, Associate Vice President for Financial Assistance Dan Small  bumped the cost estimate for personal expenses from $1,400 to $1,450.
“We realize some students may have higher fee charges, but we felt this was the only way in which this office could address this issue by increasing the ‘miscellaneous’ fees,” Small said.
The administrator said he and Senior Vice President for Student and Academic Support Services Robert Chernak reached out to the SA after reading a report from their fee commission early this semester.
The student-led committee laid out 10 costs students may incur while enrolled at GW, such as student health visits, study abroad programs and printing, which could amount to about $8,600 for students who use all the services mentioned in the report.
Sen. John Bennett, U-At-Large and member of the fee commission, said there are other fees not included in the report because “it is impossible to measure” the indirect fees coming out of student organizations’ pockets.
“I think the University is cognizant of the fact that they’re probably low-balling the cost of attendance,” Bennett said of the $50 uptick. “I don’t think it goes all the way, but it’s a step in the right direction.”
Student Association President John Richardson lauded the $50 increase – which he acknowledged is one-1,000th of the cost of attending GW for one year – as “a big win” for the fee transparency effort he has led since the fall.

“In essence, this is accomplishing what we were trying to do with the fee commission, to find out what the hell students are paying and go by that figure,” Richardson said. “[This estimate] is better in line with what an average student can expect to pay.”
In addressing the issue of fees not factored into a student’s financial aid package, the 13-member fee commission argues that students could become eligible to receive more financial assistance or loan credit with higher acknowledged personal expenses, but GW does not pledge to meet 100 percent of demonstrated need.
Small declined to comment how the $50 increase compared to past adjustments made to estimate costs.
Cost of attendance is broken down into tuition, room and board, personal expenses, transportation costs, SA and matriculation fees and books and supplies – totaling about $60,000 per year.

Wait, who’s Adam Morgan?
As a freshman, I never find myself with enough time to leave campus borders. I’m more concerned with going to class, meeting friends, doing schoolwork and, hopefully, getting enough sleep.
Freshman year is a time when we’re the most interested – and rightfully so – with college student life, and trying not to buckle under the newfound pressure. Not to mention, the cold of the D.C. winter can make it difficult to want to go anywhere past Funger Hall.
But now the spring weather is here.
Freshmen: We’ve adjusted to life as college students, made our friends and become acquainted with campus. It’s time to use the warm weather as an incentive to leave Foggy Bottom and explore everything that makes the city great.
D.C., after all, has a lot to offer in terms of the variety of food and restaurants, the vast shopping opportunities, the vibrant cultures and languages in each of its neighborhoods and the history that could have unfolded just minutes away. Each neighborhood in D.C. has its own personality, and we’re only doing a disservice to ourselves if we don’t take the initiative to explore them. After all, we’re here for an education, and we can receive some of that simply by experiencing new perspectives and new places.
The borders of the University don’t have to end at Georgetown and the monuments. There are more cherry blossoms than just the ones around the Jefferson Memorial.
So hop on the Metro, and go somewhere on the Red or Green lines. Take a walk somewhere you’ve always wanted to go. Try a new cuisine, and go to a museum that sounds engaging.
The University prides itself on the fact that the city and the campus are one and the same. It’s up to us make that true.
So, what are you waiting for? The city is calling.

Emeritus professor Lance Hoffman said adding security to computer systems is like building safety into automobiles: innovation often comes in response to mishaps.
As the government makes investments to support more cybersecurity workers, Hoffman said demand has grown because “most systems today are like the security in most automobiles in 1940, before they had seat belts even – let alone airbags.”
Almost 20 years after Hoffman helped start the University’s first cybersecurity research institute, calls from private contractors and federal agencies for more specialists to protect computer systems are echoing into academics. The School of Engineering and Applied Science will offer students a headstart toward a career in cybersecurity when it launches a master of science degree in cybersecurity next fall.
The program, announced March 19, will be one of the country’s few degrees in cybersecurity, which are also offered at nearby University of Maryland-Baltimore County and Carnegie Mellon University.
The degree will prepare students to help protect not only basic computer information but also privacy violations and online identity theft, computer science department chair Abdou Youssef said.
He said about 70 students have expressed interest in applying, but the program would enroll only about 15 students next year. Youssef expects it will grow annually until the program stabilizes at a class of about 60 students.
“D.C. is one of the largest and most vibrant high-tech areas in the United States and the world,” Youssef said. “Professionals are in need of cybersecurity expertise to advance their career and help the private sector and the government secure their assets and protect against cyber attacks.”
Students will follow a 30-credit curriculum in the program, which has the same core courses as the school’s advanced computer science program, but includes security courses like cryptography and computer network defense. Most of the courses will include hands-on work outside of the classroom. One class tests students on their ability to prevent attacks where professors send viruses and other threats to students’ computers.
The master’s program will initially include six professors, Youssef said.
The department began exploring the creation of a master’s degree in fall 2010 – the same year the nation’s top defense brass began highlighting a shortage in cybersecurity workers. Support from engineering school Dean David Dolling, Provost Steven Lerman and Vice President for Research Leo Chapula gave the proposal momentum, Youssef said.
GW has also already gotten on board with the federal government’s aid for future cybersecurity workers through the CyberCorps program, which provides full scholarships for study to undergraduates, master’s and doctoral students in computer science.
Joseph Mathews has worked in the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory focusing on cybersecurity since he graduated from GW as a computer engineering major in 2004, and said his career was launched in the burgeoning field after pursuing a masters degree through the Department of Defense scholarship program.
“GW is one of the few universities offering this program in this specific field. Most universities want you to do something traditional with only some computer security,” Mathews said. “By focusing the curriculum around cybersecurity, students will have a fundamental knowledge in one base curriculum.”
Applications have opened and are tentatively due by May 1.

International students are more likely to cheat than their American counterparts, according to internal data released this week, mirroring a growing trend of academic dishonesty among foreign students in U.S. colleges.
Non-citizen students, who make up about 12.1 percent of the GW student population, were responsible for nearly a quarter of all instances of academic dishonesty last year – the highest percentage in the available data. About 100 cases of alleged academic dishonesty were reported last year.
Instances of cheating from this population have increased over the past five years, and remain a “growing” problem so far this year, Director of the Office of Academic Integrity Tim Terpstra said. In 2006, 15 percent of violations were committed by non-U.S. citizens, who made up less than a tenth of the student population. That figure hovered in the high teens until last year, when it spiked to 23 percent.
The University statistics mirror a national problem, according to a study presented at a Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education conference this month. International students are also more likely to cheat using technology, such as getting exam answers on the Internet and copying online material without proper attribution, the study found.
The authors of the study, which analyzed responses from a public research university in Arizona, did not return requests for comment. The study also found that members of Greek life are more likely to cheat, a variable GW does not track, Terpstra said.
The University hosts information sessions for newly admitted international students before the start of each semester, but Terpstra said it may expand outreach to try to rein in international student cheating. His office has not yet formalized plans to better educate international students about academic honesty.
“With the percentages going up we are going to have to certainly reach out more and try to emphasize what constitutes cheating in our culture and how to avoid it,” he said.
Terpstra attributed the trend to a slew of factors, including misunderstood rules and difficulty with English.
All cases of confirmed academic dishonesty are followed by a sanction specific to the type of violation. Those convicted of plagiarism are generally referred to the University Writing Center, while others who cheated because of poor time management or emotional health are often referred to the University Counseling Center, Terpstra said.
The majority of cases result in a failure of the assignment and a handful see failure of the course.
Junior Arjun Awasthi, an international student from India, said he wasn’t surprised, because his teachers failed to dissuade students from cheating in primary school.
“It is not very ingrained that if you are caught cheating, you are out. In high school, everyone used to cheat. There were not very serious consequences for cheating,” he said of his experience in India. “My experience is that, when I came to GW, I had never written a paper in my life. I think that plagiarism can come into play because people don’t have any clue what they are doing.”

As the Colonials took the field for a three-game series over the weekend, they faced more than one opponent on the newly-installed turf at Barcroft Park.
With weather forecasts shifting the weekend’s schedule and moderate rain falling for most of the third game, GW was forced to overcome mother nature’s lingering presence, as well as the efforts of A-10 rival La Salle.
After dropping the first two games of the series to the Explorers by respective scores of 7-4 and 2-1, the Colonials (7-16) stormed back Saturday, winning a tight third game by a margin of 6-4. Despite giving up the lead late in the second game and ultimately falling short, GW showed no signs of layover in the nightcap, putting forth a winning combination of solid pitching and clutch hitting.
“The first two games, we were a play and a hit away from winning, so the guys were really bummed out and depressed,” head coach Steve Mrowka said. “When you have to play in rain and tough conditions the whole time, and then you lose the three-inning game we had to finish up first – that was a heartbreaker.”
The Colonials first fell Friday and again Saturday afternoon when Friday’s night game was postponed to the next day due to lightning. La Salle took advantage of two GW errors to take an early 5-0 lead in the first game of the series. Though GW attempted to mount a comeback with a brief offensive surge, the Explorers hung tough for a 7-4 victory.
In the second game of the series, the Colonials at first appeared to have control. Led by a solid pitching performance from sophomore Aaron Weisberg, GW had a 1-0 lead heading into the top of the seventh. But when the game was resumed Saturday, the Explorers scored two runs right off the bat, taking a 2-1 lead that the Colonials failed to overcome.
In the third game of the series, La Salle took an early 1-0 lead in the first, but the Colonials responded with two runs of their own in the bottom half of the second. Junior pitcher Tyler McCarthy settled down in the second and third innings, ending the day with only two earned runs over five innings of work. Following McCarthy’s exit from the game, pitchers Colin Milon and Justin Albright were each summoned from the bullpen, turning in a combined four innings of work, while giving up one run on two hits.
“It’s raining, and the mound is a total mess. When the guys from the bullpen come out here, other guys have already been digging holes. It’s very difficult,” Mrowka said. “I was proud of Colin and Justin that they game in here throwing strikes. That was huge for us.”
The Colonials hung tough through LaSalle comebacks in the fourth and seventh innings. GW’s middle to bottom of the lineup hitters came through in the clutch yet again, this time in the home half of the eighth. Sophomore Owen Beightol walked to start the inning and following a double by senior Jimmy Best, two runners were on base for hot-hitting junior Ryan Hickey. Already two for two with two singles on the day, Hickey lined a one-out fastball through the left side of the infield, driving in two runs and putting the Colonials up 6-4.
“I was just seeing it well, I was going out there having a lot of confidence and having the coaches have a lot of confidence,” Hickey said. “I know that says a lot for our team that we got nine guys that can go out there any given day and win the ballgame. I know the top of the order had a tough day, but the bottom of the order game through and helped pick up the W.”
Regardless of the two losses, Mrowka was encouraged by the Colonials’ ability to come back and take game three of the series. Though GW’s record is far from perfect, Mrowka feels his team has both talent and potential, and looks to boost its play to the heights he believes are within the team’s reach.
“We haven’t come out of the gates real fast, but we know we have a pretty good team,” Mrowka said. “We’re just hoping to get better in all areas. We have a lot of guys that are still struggling a little bit with the bat, and hopefully we can help them get their swings going and get some confidence.”
