The Metropolitan Police Department plans to roll out a new tool this month that will allow District residents to report theft and other non-violent crimes online, in hopes of streamlining the incident reporting process.
As an alternative to filing paper reports, users will be able to access the online crime-reporting system through the department’s home page, MPD spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said.
“This new system will allow citizens to file certain police reports online, rather than having to call the police and have a police officer respond,” Crump said. “In other sectors of government, technology is being used to make filing reports or obtaining information more efficient and easier.”
Once an online report is logged, the complainant will receive a preliminary report through e-mail. Officers will review a final report and send an electronic copy to the individual reporting the incident.
Individuals can still choose to file paper reports, but MPD will encourage use of the website, Crump said. Violent crimes cannot be reported through the online system, because officers respond to those situations directly for safety purposes.
“The online tool is not to be used as a substitute for direct police service in emergency situations,” Crump said.
Though it may take residents time to become familiar with the online option, she said it will streamline the process for those who would otherwise call in to make reports.
For nonviolent crimes including theft, burglary, stolen vehicles and arson, the department received a total of 26,374 reports in 2011, MPD law enforcement analyst Sean Goodison said. Police Service Area 207, which includes GW, saw about 385 of those incidents.
The Boise Police Department in Idaho has an online crime-reporting tool that asks users to select specific nonviolent crime categories, warning multiple times that it should not be used for emergencies and that filing a false police report is criminal. Police in Sacramento, Calif., Seattle, Fairfax County, Va. and San Diego also offer online filing systems.

Before President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign that easily attracted the under-25 voting bloc, politicians and parties spent much time and capital persuading young people to “get out the vote.” Looking back on these campaigns, I can’t help but think of popular celebrities like Diddy and Mariah Carey who used their fame to urge Generation Y to “vote or die.”
Political apathy is nothing new, but at a collegiate election level, it can be rampant. Students are rarely as enthused about Student Association elections as they are about their internships, their classes or the national elections. Students have to be either ignorant of what the SA is or disenchanted by its record, if only 20 percent of the student body takes the time to vote for its student representatives.
The Joint Elections Committee, which oversees the rules and regulations for the student elections, is pledging to do more to promote student involvement in the voting process. While the committee has promoted elections to a degree in the past it is primarily tasked with holding the candidates accountable for following election rules.
Phil Gardner, chair of the Joint Elections Committee, said that the committee would rely slightly more on the reported violations from the public while taking a less active role in actually searching for violations.
Gardner seems sincere in his desire to balance the current Joint Elections Committee task with the increased focus on turnout. But the JEC won’t be able to do both effectively.
The Joint Elections Committee needs to use its power to ensure elections are fair, transparent and legal. The committee has definitely gone overboard in exercising its power over elections in previous years – something Gardner wants to avoid this year. Upperclassmen may remember in 2009 when Kyle Boyer, a popular SA presidential candidate, faced charges of exceeding his spending limit because he borrowed a car. In a controversial move, the committee counted the charge as a violation and disqualified Boyer from the ballot, and since then, the JEC has tried to be less meticulous in defining violations.
But going from picking apart campaign rules to “letting the kids play” as Gardner stated may not yield the best results. The committee should not only report “egregious” violations. Voters may actually miss out on important information about the candidates, and the JEC could miss out on important “minor” violations. The Joint Elections Committee serves as a necessary, knowledgeable watchdog in an election process that can be complicated and too easily shrouded in mystery. Students need to know when their potential future SA president can’t stay within a budget. Students in organizations who need to obey rules for hanging event flyers should be confident that their SA Senator obeys slightly stricter campaign postering rules.
In terms of the new role the JEC wants to take, there should of course be more student involvement in the Student Association elections. Twenty percent of student turnout is an embarrassment. But convincing students to vote should ultimately be a job for individual student organizations or Program Board – groups that are typically responsible for getting students involved and excited for on-campus issues.
While it is problematic if the JEC attempts to remove candidates from the ballot as a result of campaign violations, this year’s committee has an understanding that such a result is not good for the student body. But it is important that the Joint Elections Committee continues to serve its primary role of holding the candidates accountable – and just that.

Campus seems to be filled this week with screaming freshmen reuniting for the first time in a month.
This sight is all too familiar for me, as just one year ago I was coming back after my first winter break, both excited for a new semester but also nervous for the future.
And if there was any advice I wished I had last year, it is this: Bring a fresh perspective to campus life; leave the past behind; be prepared to start anew.
Reflecting on my first few months as a Colonial, I was not active enough in creating my own GW experience. So after returning from break, I resolved to start fresh and have an active role in shaping a new life for myself.
My first concern coming back for second semester was my grades, as I felt discouraged and disappointed after receiving my first semester marks.
While it is easy to say, “I wish I had done this differently,” it is better to come back and say, “I’m going to do this differently.” Rather than feeling dismayed about classes, use the mistakes you made as lessons to apply for the future.
If I could redo my first semester, I would have set higher expectations for myself and gone to office hours more often. Even just sitting down and reading can help push you further toward a higher academic goal.
Beyond the classroom, it can be difficult to develop strong, lasting relationships with others freshman year, particularly at a big school like GW. And as freshman spring semester moves on, it can be scary to see friendships constantly changing.
Being open-minded will help you keep old friends while still allowing you to meet new people. But while an easygoing outlook is a start, be prepared for relationships and friendships to constantly change.
Most freshmen go through these shifts with their friends, so be willing to join clubs, which will make it even easier to meet more people.
During my first semester of college I had planned to ease my way into things. By late January, I was ready to join whatever came my way. Even signing up to get listserv e-mails about an organization is a start. Even better? Attend the first meeting of a club that’s not completely in your comfort zone.
But by taking one step forward and attending a few of the first events of different clubs, you can discover new passions that will allow you to create a personal niche at GW.
Looking back on a little over a year ago, it’s surprising to notice how many changes occur during freshman year. But the best way to prepare for this is to continue to explore campus and to make every semester be a new semester.
Challenge yourself to take on something new, and you’ll find a few good surprises down the road.

I am writing in response to the column “Transparency in UPD misconduct Cases” (Dec. 8, p. 4). I want to offer information about the George Washington University Police Department’s complaint process to your readers.
As an accredited law enforcement agency, the department performs thorough internal investigations into allegations of misconduct. The International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators and the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies accredit GWPD. Both of these well regarded organizations ensure the department maintains proper procedures by auditing departmental policies and investigations.
Furthermore, the Metropolitan Police Department’s Security Officer’s Management Branch is the government agency responsible for issuing commissions to campus police officers. They too can take administrative action if they find misconduct regarding an officer’s actions.
Our goal is to complete investigations of alleged misconduct within 15 days, during which the complainant will be contacted. There might be delays, however, if the complainant chooses to file an anonymous complaint or the department has difficulty contacting the reporting person and/or witnesses to the incident. If a delay occurs beyond 15 days, the reporting person may contact the department for periodic status reports at upd@upd.gwu.edu. When the investigation is completed, the complainant is contacted and told whether the complaint was substantiated – meaning we were able to determine if his or her complaint had merit.  
GWPD has a long record of disciplining officers who violate policy. Conversely, we also have a long record of rewarding and honoring officers who perform above and beyond expectations. If students, faculty, staff or other members of the community wish to lodge a complaint against a campus police officer or offer a commendation for professional service, they can go to our website at http://gwired.gwu.edu/upd and click on the tab entitled “Service Feedback Form.”
Kevin C. Hay is the chief of police.

As the group that regulates the Student Association elections each spring, the Joint Elections Committee plays a critical role in campus election transparency.
But senior Phil Gardner, the chair of the JEC, is looking to alter the role of the election watchdogs. Rather than stringently investigating minor election rule violations, Gardner is scaling back the committee’s responsibility from a police force’s to a referee’s. Instead of sending out investigators to catch nitpicky violations, the JEC will now rely on the public to report alleged violations for the committee to investigate. The committee members will instead focus on improving student participation in the elections, as only about 20 percent of the student body actually votes.
The Joint Elections Committee has been criticized in the past for applying the charter rules to an extreme, and Gardner is right to seek reform on that issue.
But a move away from actively seeking out election violations is a potentially dangerous decision that could negatively affect the campaigning process. While it is important to rely on the community to police itself, there must be a strong presence from the JEC to maintain a fair and steady electoral process.
We do not trust that each candidate will adhere to election rules without the presence of the JEC.
It seems too idealistic that most minor electoral infractions will be brought to the committee’s attention, so the JEC must continue to take the lead in demanding fair play from candidates.
While the committee will still enforce egregious violations, allowing minor violations to occur and fester will undoubtedly damage the integrity and credibility of the campaigning and electoral process.
There is no doubt that in the past the JEC has been too stringent in enforcing some of its electoral rules. But an appropriate balance must be maintained between actively upholding the committee charter while not becoming overbearing at the same time.

Messy refrigerators can become a black hole for groceries. Shopping lists more often than not still lack essential ingredients after fighting through long checkout lines, and it can be hard to come up with a recipe only using leftovers.
One multi-talented senior thinks he has the solution to these culinary problems.
John Gearheart hopes to solve this supermarket conundrum with his idea for the Ctrl+F Kitchen.
After learning that grocery stores will soon be replacing traditional barcodes with intelligent barcodes, called radio-frequency identification tags, the engineering major was inspired to come up with an idea to overhaul the traditional kitchen.
Gearheart’s invention would allow users to track groceries in their home, search recipes that they can make from leftover ingredients and keep tabs on soon-to-be perishable food.
Radio-frequency identification tags use a radio system to track an object, transmitting data from a tag placed on the object and allowing people to track items’ whereabouts as well as stored information like price or product description. They are already used in many industries, tracking the locations of automobiles, pharmaceuticals and animals.
“It involves adding a microchip the size of a grain of sand into every item in your kitchen, installing chip readers in every cabinet and shelf and designing a software program to locate any item,” Gearheart said of his project.
In the most simple terms, “It’s just like when you use your GWorld to tap into a dorm at GWU,” Gearheart said.
A biomedical engineer major, Gearheart had been toying with the idea of the Ctrl+F Kitchen for some time and decided to enter it into the Intel Innovators Competition in December.
“I submitted my idea during finals week just as a distraction from studying, and didn’t expect it to be picked up,” he said.
To his surprise, Gearheart’s Ctrl+F Kitchen was chosen as one of the top 20 ideas out of over 500 entries and is now part of a monthlong Facebook Intel Innovators competition for the top five innovative ideas in categories including science, travel, medicine and sports.
All participants are required to submit a 30-second video explaining the details of their ideas and why they could be influential. On Jan. 23, the top five innovators, selected by most popular vote on Facebook, will present their ideas to five panelists, including Intel’s Chief Financial Officer Joshua Auerbach. The panelists will select the most inventive and potentially impactful idea, ultimately awarding its innovator with $100,000.
As of Jan. 18  Gearheart is in fourth place, and has raised over 6,280,300 points of social capital, a form of gauging support.  His biggest competition includes an idea for a computer program that reads online newspapers out loud for the visually impaired, and a cloud system used to store the complete medical histories of each person in the United States.
“I’m very nervous, but since coming back to school, I’ve been e-mailing all of my friends and votes have been coming in from the entire GW University,” Gearheart said.
Gearheart’s spirit for innovation is nothing new, he said.
“I’ve always been inventing things,” Gearheart said, “I came in third place in fifth grade in an invention competition when I developed the idea for a transponder between school buses and homes so you don’t have to guess when the bus is coming.”
Gearheart hopes to work for Johnson & Johnson specializing in optical diagnostics, which he describes as “developing software that relates to keeping an inventory and managing different sensors.”
But for now, John Gearheart is making sure you never forget the milk, eggs or bread at the supermarket again.

The 9:30 Club
Feb. 28 to March 1 
If you don’t like Of A Revolution, more commonly known as simply O.A.R., don’t go to this show. You won’t like the loud, beer drinking fans having fun and dancing around to their favorite tracks by one of the decade’s biggest rock acts.
For the rest of you, this is going to be an amazing few nights. The band’s new album, “King,” is a follow-up to the band’s first studio album, “The Wanderer,” and the transition symbolizes the band’s growth since they first started playing together back in high school. This is going to be a fun show. Of course, you’ll hear favorites like “Crazy Game of Poker” and “Shattered,” but the real joy in O.A.R. shows is hearing low-key fan favorites like “I Feel Home” and “City on Down.” There are still tickets around for the third night, and a portion of the proceeds benefit the group’s “Heard the World Fund” for sustainable education programs around the world.
Score: Three nights. Fan favorites. Small venue. Dancing shoes.

Bore: Lots of bros.
The 9:30 Club
Feb. 6
Theophilus London offers a pretty fresh take on hip-hop, allowing flavors from around the world to influence his brew. Born in Trinidad but raised in the U.S., the heavy beats and powerful bass lines in his music have been driving audiences wild since his major label debut in 2009. Last year was a big time for London; performances at the Cannes International Film Festival and the Montreal International Jazz Festival made him into a darling of the music critic world, while his fantastic street style placed him in magazines like GQ and The Fader.
London is known for his captivating performances, and his dance moves are second to none, so you can bet this will be a high-energy show. He’s definitely a guy to check out while you can, because he won’t be playing small venues like the 9:30 Club for long.
Score: Dance music from a major up and comer. Tracks like “Flying Overseas” and my personal favorite, “Why Even Try,” are sure to get you moving.

Bore: It’s going be a hipster fashion show. If you’re not looking to get your game face going on a Monday night, this might not be the show for you.

Ryan Adams is a unique talent. When he first began playing guitar and singing two decades ago, he performed in punk bands, screaming his lungs out on stage. A few samples of these performances exist, and they give interesting insight into one of the artists who has helped shape the country-rock genre. He achieved notoriety as the lead singer and guitarist for Whiskytown, releasing two albums that gained massive critical acclaim for the band’s lyrical content as well as their effort to push the genre forward.
The band split at the dawn of the last decade, and Adams started to record on his own. The years since then have been filled with album after album, which were received with a mix of praise and criticism. In 2007, on a break from playing with his new band, The Cardinals, Adams released my favorite example of his work, “Easy Tiger,” featuring “Oh My God, Whatever, Etc.” and “Halloweenhead.” Following the album’s release, Adams admitted to serious drug problems, and a few years later, he retired from music. Thankfully, Adams came out of retirement last year with a new album, and the promotion tour is a huge chance to see one of the genre’s greatest in the flesh.
Score: Amazing lyrics – some dancing tracks and some thinking tracks – what more could you ask for? Also, he’s married to the gorgeous Mandy Moore. Awesome.

Bore: Many of the tracks may be from the new disc, which is not my favorite. Also, Mandy will probably not be in attendance.
