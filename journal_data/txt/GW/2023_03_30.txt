Student war divestment coalition GW Dissenters hosted student protesters from seven other Dissenters chapters from across the country Sunday for a march through Foggy Bottom in protest of their universities’ investment in war and weapons manufacturers.
About 40 from GW, Howard, Johns Hopkins, Hampton, Florida State universities and the Universities of Virginia, Massachusetts and Houston rallied in Kogan Plaza before marching to interim University President Mark Wrighton’s F Street House and continuing on to the State Department during a 2-hour-long demonstration. Student demonstrators said they hoped the interregional rally, the most recent action in GW Dissenters’ Divest from Death campaign, promoted training and community building with other student activists across the country and pressured their institutions to commit to divestment from war and weapon productions. 
GW Dissenters launched a petition in November calling for the Board of Trustees to divest from top weapon manufacturers, garnering more than 300 signatures, and questioned trustees on their divestment plans after an executive session last month. According to pamphlets handed out at Sunday’s rally, GW allegedly receives funding from the top five weapons manufacturers – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Gruman and General Dynamics.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said GW does not make investment decisions on a company-by-company basis. She said the University is aware of GW Dissenters’ petition and will review its recommendations for divestment.
“The endowment is invested in a diverse portfolio of funds that are adjusted regularly,” Metjian said in an email. “The University works to ensure that the endowment is managed in a legal and ethical manner.”
Former University President Thomas LeBlanc rejected a Student Association Senate proposal in 2018 calling on the University to divest from companies providing weapons and services to the Israeli government, which reportedly contributed to Palestinian human rights abuses, saying the resolution did not reflect the University’s views.
Senior Jelina Liu, the founder of GW’s Dissenters chapter and an organizer of Sunday’s rally, said GW Dissenters’ priorities are to meet with officials and initiate conversations to urge them to divest from the weapons industry. 
“Our main message is that, obviously, we want the University to divest from the weapons industry and at least meet with us,” Liu said. “That’s the bare minimum.” 
Liu said when the group confronted trustees after an executive session of the Board last month, trustees like Chair Grace Speights said they would consider the petition but didn’t commit to divestment. She said Trustee Mark Chichester expressed willingness to talk to students and hear their concerns about divestment but hasn’t met with GW Dissenters. 
“He’s like, ‘Oh, actually, you can’t set up a meeting with an individual trustee,’” Liu said. “And then when we just kind of pressed him, he just was like, ‘Oh, you guys are being rude and discourteous.’”
Liu said Dissenters is working to center diversity as a priority for the divestment movement and amplify the voices of students of color in an attempt to progress from the predominantly white activism of the anti-war movement during the Vietnam War era.
“I wanted to emphasize that it’s predominantly students of color,” she said. “It was formed just because the current anti-war movement is very much like old white people, which is fine, but, you know, we want to diversify that sh*t.”
In June 2020, the Board voted to fully divest the University’s endowment from fossil fuel companies by 2025. Liu says this commitment provides a “precedent” for GW Dissenters’ push for war-industry divestment.
Ren Encinas, an organizer of the national Dissenters organization, said they came to GW from Chicago to support students in their “fight against war and militarism” and join GW students’ calls to demand the trustees remove GW’s investments from weapons manufacturers.
“Students here are organizing against GW Board of Trustees’ investments in weapons manufacturers and this is a struggle that is shared by all of our campuses across the United States,” Encinas said. 
Encinas said that as part of their role in the national organization, they train and coach student members through fellowship programs with students from universities across the country in hopes of molding student activists’ skills to become “antimilitarist organizers.”
“The other students and chapters here are also waging divest from death campaigns or counter recruitment campaigns that are all targeting our University’s ties to militarism and war,” Encinas said.
Junior Ruby Brayton, a member of GW Dissenters, said holding the protest on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the United States’ invasion of Iraq March 20 was symbolic in emphasizing the length of the country’s hand in the war. Brayton said it was jarring to realize some of her friends have not experienced a time in U.S. history when the country has not been involved in a war, and she hopes to bring awareness to the millions of lives that have been lost to the “U.S. war machine” to fight for an end to the destruction.
“We need to invest in mutual aid and caring for our neighbors and having an enveloping sense of love and support, rather than just investing in death and endless war,” Brayton said.
Freshman Veronica Hernandez, a member of Howard University’s Dissenters, said she participated in Sunday’s protest because she does not support Howard’s investment of money into the military, which could instead be directed to student funding. She said Howard has permanent military recruiters on campus and people who “provide military and research internships,” when she would like to see more resources for students instead, following over a month of protests last year demanding Howard officials for better housing conditions after students found mold in the walls of their residence halls and a lack of COVID testing on campus. 
“We have mental health resources, we have better food, we have more students who are guaranteed housing,” Hernandez said. “Because a lot of students, especially at Howard, live in their cars, you know, and they come and they take classes at Howard, but they don’t have a place to live.”

SA Sen. Linsi Goodin, CCAS-G, the chair of the finance committee, gave a report on the preliminary requests received during the general allocations process for the fall 2023 semester.
The Student Association Senate unanimously approved a $1.31 million budget for the upcoming school year Monday.
The Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Budgeting Act set a budget ceiling of about $1.31 million for the upcoming fiscal year, similar to last year’s $1.3 million budget. The act sets aside $531,750 in funding for the academic year’s general allocations process – the process student organizations use to build their budgets – and about $149,000 for co-sponsorships, which student organizations can apply to specific events.
SA Sen. Linsi Goodin, CCAS-G, the chair of the finance committee, gave a report on the preliminary requests received during the general allocations process for the fall 2023 semester.
​​”We had a rabid debate over the process of a multi-day process and we greatly appreciate all the assistance that was provided during this time,” Goodin said.
Goodin said the total requested amount from student organizations was $1,931,307, more than five times the amount of general allocation funds available. The act budgeted about $241,000 for fall semester general allocations.
Goodin said the finance committee has approved preliminary general allocations to student organizations. She said the committee sent student organizations an email with their preliminary budget Monday morning. Goodin said the window for student organizations to appeal budget decisions will open Thursday and close April 7.
The budget sets aside $350,724 for graduate student umbrella organizations, like GW Law’s Student Bar Association, and $48,325 for the SA’s operating budget, which pays for the SA’s food, drink and costs associated with holding meetings, about 3.7 percent of the SA’s total expected funds. According to SA bylaws, the SA’s operating budget may not exceed more than 5 percent of the SA’s total funds.
Aaron Howell, the assistant director of Student Rights and Responsibilities, said the office has drafted proposals for changes to the Code of Academic Integrity, including the addition of a warning process in academic dishonesty cases. Howell said the process would clarify accused students’ rights.
Howell said the revisions will also change the definition of intentional plagiarism in an effort to ensure the office speaks with instructors about how to include artificial intelligence resources, like ChatGPT, under the definition of plagiarism.
“By adding these changes, we’re not taking the stance of completely, 100 percent prohibiting the use of artificial intelligence agencies,” he said. “In our conversations with the community, we’ve talked with instructors about how to incorporate ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence resources into their pedagogical approach.”
He said the current code references intentional plagiarism as deliberately using any “person’s” ideas as one’s own, whereas the revised code will move away from the term “person,” and instead will be defined as using words and ideas without proper attribution.
Christy Anthony, the director of Student Rights and Responsibilities, said that while the SA Senate does not vote on the proposed changes to the Code of Student Conduct, she was seeking feedback on the potential changes.
She said general feedback from students has been “very positive” for their proposed changes to exceptions of prohibited behaviors, like exceptions to physical abuse charges in cases of self-defense. She said if a student is alleged to have committed physical abuse, but it occurred in the context of self defense, the student could be exempt from the physical-abuse allegation.
Student Court Chief Justice Devin Eager said there will be five court vacancies to fill after four of the current justices, including himself, graduate in May and another graduates in the summer.
“It is imperative that the legislative branch and the executive branch work together to seat five new justices to the bench,” Eager said.
Two anonymous public comments criticized SA President Christian Zidouemba, who the Joint Elections Commission found violated election bylaws by collecting signatures for his petition under the guise he was collecting signatures for other candidates.
Sabrina Causley, the president of GW’s American Foundation for Suicide Prevention chapter, said in a presentation to the senate that the group is working to change the language people use when discussing suicide. She said rather than using terms like “committed suicide” or describing attempts as failed or successful, AFSP wants to shift the language towards using “died by suicide, ended their life or suicide attempts.”
“It’s important that we understand the perspective of a suicidal person,” Causley said. “We want to understand that a crisis point has been reached in their life. They’re desperate to escape, and their thinking has become limited.”
SA Vice President Yan Xu said in his report that he is working to schedule a meeting with Campus Living and Residential Education to present a joint report from the Residence Hall Association and himself on the conditions and maintenance of residence halls.
Xu also said he heard from the diversity team and the Faculty Senate that the provost’s office requires all professors to receive Title IX and anti-discrimination training.
The next regularly scheduled SA Senate meeting will be held April 10 at 8:30 p.m. in the University Student Center’s Continental Ballroom.

Facing a problem yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
Dear Annie,
I was recently courted by a man I met at a party. By the time I realized our past few hangouts were actually dates, I found myself hooking up with him. This has shocked my friends and myself: a woman who has identified as a lesbian for the past two years. I’m unsure if my interest in him is genuine or if I just appreciate the attention and the allure of fulfilling traditional gender roles. How do I decide whether or not to pursue this?
XOXO,
Suddenly Un-Lesbian
Introducing “Annie’s Friends!”
Do you remember the feeling in elementary school when the teacher would call on you, but you did not know the answer? I felt like I was back in the classroom when I received this submission, so I phoned a friend. 
I’m happy to introduce “Ask Annie’s Friends,” a new series of guest columnists who will jump in every now and again when I receive submissions that could use some experience and perspective beyond my own. Without further ado, here is Ask Annie’s first guest columnist and, more importantly, my friend!
Dear Suddenly Un-Lesbian,
In a society where women are taught their worth comes from appealing to men, it makes sense that most women enjoy consensual male validation. It’s flattering to receive attention from just about anyone – everyone wants to be thought of as attractive.
While I’ve identified as a lesbian for most of my life and never questioned that, flirting with men at parties or bars is always fun. Whether it’s the result of the patriarchy, gender norms or just a strong drink, at the very least the interaction makes a funny story for a bagel debrief the next morning.

Remember that recognizing someone as attractive is not the same as being attracted to that person. That being said, sexuality can be a spectrum, and it’s not always linear. Sometimes, our sexual identities can shift and evolve depending on who we meet at various stages of our lives. Have fun exploring your identity, but remember there is no right or wrong answer and no pressure to label yourself right away or at all. As long as you are honest with yourself and your paramour about your feelings, there is no harm in dipping your toes in the hetero-pool.
Since you’ve identified as a lesbian for two years, this might be old news to you, but the viral lesbian masterdoc – a 30-page PDF written by Tumblr user Anjeli Luz in 2018 – delves into the term “compulsory heterosexuality.” Luz argues that society’s obsession with heterosexual romance drives women’s attitude towards men, as they over-romanticize any positive feelings and conflate them with attraction. She incorporates her personal experience in a way that has resonated with many readers exploring their own sexualities.
It’s definitely possible that you might be experiencing this phenomenon, especially if you’re grappling with the allure of fulfilling traditional gender roles. But while compulsory heterosexuality is a common experience for many lesbians, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the case in your situation. If you enjoyed hooking up and spending time with this man, you have nothing to lose by going on an official date with him – the worst that can happen is you tell him you’re not interested. Just be honest and upfront with him as soon as you understand your feelings to avoid blindsiding him or leading him on.
After experimenting, you might discover you are a lesbian after all, bisexual with a preference for women or anything in between. All of the above options are perfectly valid – but whatever the case may be, you can always flirt with men in bars – safely – for free drinks. It’s harmless, and drinks are expensive in the District! 😉
Keep slaying,
Annie’s Token Lesbian<3

During my first week of classes of my freshman year, I was heckled while talking on the phone with my mother. I had my earbuds in, recounting my first week to her as I walked to a local coffee shop. A man in a delivery truck honked at me and shouted an incoherent phrase. Naively, I reversed my steps and removed my earbuds, quirked a brow and asked him, “Are you talking to me?”
“Yeah, I was just saying your ass was out,” he said. “Pull down your shirt. It’s not safe to walk around like that.” Sure enough, my backpack was riding up my shirt and exposing me more than I intended to. I thanked him for letting me know and continued on my way. The irony of thanking a strange man on the street for honking at me and loudly scolding me for wearing revealing clothing didn’t hit me until later that evening – what happened was still harassment.
The catcalling I experienced only worsened as my time living alone in D.C. went on. Two months into school, a man followed a group of girls and me to Opera Ultra Lounge for several blocks. A few weeks later, I was catcalled walking home from Landmark’s E Street Cinema. And no more than a month after that, a man old enough to be my father asked for my number while waiting for the crosswalk light to turn green.
At school, I clutch a rape alarm when I walk alone at night, make sure to share my locations with my friends before we go out and cover my arms across my chest when I’m wearing a low-cut shirt downtown. I shrug or laugh off these past incidents of harassment – they become anecdotes for the dining hall, inside jokes with friends and a relatable story to share with a girl sitting next to me in class. Women trauma bond over our shared harassment experiences and don’t even realize we’re doing it, which is almost as devastating as the catcalling and hypersexualization on the streets of D.C. We swap stories of sexual harassment, finding a distressing comfort in the common experience.
As soon as I turned 18 last summer, I felt like my legality was broadcast on a billboard for all men to see – it suddenly becomes okay for a 40 year old to approach a girl in a backpack as long as doing so is within the law. But ironically, I feel safe in the city. I just don’t walk alone off campus at night, slow down my pace to admire the bright lights past 7 p.m. or run outside in tank tops despite the climbing D.C. temperatures. I avoid participating in these ordinary activities – male luxuries – of mere existence.
As the weather warms and the cherry blossoms bloom, I find myself excited for sundress season. I love when I can see the sun coloring my freckles darker and broader and feel the UV rays warming my back like a heat lamp. But 70-degree weather means exposed skin, and exposed skin means unwanted advances and leering gazes. Spring in D.C. is a magical thing, but for young women, it can also be nerve-wracking. It’s a reminder that men don’t change – wardrobes do.
Catcalling is an all too common experience among GW students. I’ve heard stories from friends who have been stopped at red lights as men try luring them into their cars on Constitution Avenue, harassed in broad daylight for wearing leggings near the White House and followed by older men on campus walking back from class. These instances are mentally scarring to experience first hand and hear second hand. But there is an often undiscussed shameful pride that comes with the first time women are catcalled.
If it sounds disturbing, that’s because it is. Women are taught from a young age that our worth relies on male approval, so we come to expect harassment from men. We conflate an unsolicited “compliment” with feeling valued by society, so the first time a man shouts at us from afar – “Hey, beautiful,” “How you doin’ tonight?” or “Can I get your number?” – the catcall feels like the ghost of flattery. This may be an anti-feminist and taboo sentiment, but it’s a truthful one. Men viewing me as objectively attractive is an ugly, wonderful compliment.
I’ve come to expect a catcall when I dress up and look pretty – I’m even internally disappointed when no one harasses me on the street because although I feel beautiful, I anticipate that affirmation from men. But a few months later, the initial charm wears off when a man and his friends are walking a little too quickly and a little too close to me while I’m alone on the street. And I sure don’t find it charming when a grown man traces my 17-year-old sibling’s figure with his looming stare while they’re visiting me in the city – I find it disgusting and sickening. I wrap my coat around them only to realize that, as a teenage girl who stands under 5’4,” I’m about as much of a weapon against a 6’3” man as a butter knife against a sword. Helplessness is an exhausting state of being.
I don’t have a solution to catcalling, and it’s not up to me or any other woman to find one. These instances of harassment are simply what it means for me – for us – to exist. I am continuously sexualized, persistently tired and subhuman in the minds of many men – a woman.

The game was a day of offense as five Colonials recorded two or more hits, and every starter got on base at least once.
Baseball suffered a narrow defeat to James Madison University at home Tuesday in an offensive battle that saw GW come up one run short with two runners on base in the final inning.
The Colonials (8–18) suffered an 8-7 loss to the Dukes (15–9), letting a sixth-inning, four-run lead get away as James Madison posted four runs in the top of the seventh inning and three in the eighth. GW clawed back, coming within a single run before a fly ball to left field ended the game, concluding a four-game homestand where GW captured victories in the first three matchups.
The Colonials took an early lead in the first inning, thanks to a one-run single from graduate student catcher and clean-up hitter Anthony Frechette, knocking in senior utility player Steve DiTomaso after he made it to first on a ground ball. GW extended their lead to 4-0 in the second inning after sophomore center-fielder Sam Gates lined a one-run double down the right field line and  DiTomaso recorded a two-run single immediately after.
“I think there was a lot of positives from the game,” DiTomaso said. “From the start, we came out hot and swinging and scored a few runs which is exactly what we expect from our offense.”
The score did not change until the fifth inning coming on James Madison’s first one-run single from their designated hitter Jack Cone. The Colonials responded in the bottom of the fifth when senior third baseman Robby Wacker struck a two-run double to right-center and advanced to third, leading to a 5-1 score.
After a scoreless sixth inning, the Dukes exploded in the seventh with four runs, two of them coming off a double from sophomore catcher Jason Schiavone that scored in second and third base.
The Dukes continued their tear in the eighth with three more runs, featuring another two-run double to left field from Cone that pushed their lead to two, 7-5. Cone himself scored on a fielding error before sophomore infielder Fenwick Trimble was thrown out at home capping off the scoring and giving James Madison a 8-5 lead to end the top of the eighth.
The Colonials fired back in the bottom of the eighth with a one-run single by junior right fielder Eddie Micheletti Jr., who knocked in DiTomaso and narrowed the score to 8-6.
The Colonials held the Dukes scoreless in the top of the ninth with junior right-handed pitcher Benny Wilson on the mound, keeping hopes of a comeback alive. In the bottom of the ninth with two outs, back-to-back singles from graduate student first baseman Michael Kohn who singled to left-center and freshman designated hitter Alexander Wright who singled to right, advanced Kohn to second.
Sophomore catcher Tim Nicholson pitch-hit a one-run single right-center for GW, putting the Colonials within a single score, moving the tying run to third base standing 90 feet away and positioning the winning run at first.
Gates lifted a ball out to left field, sprinted toward base and ended the game.
Graduate student starting right-handed pitcher Austin Odell had a successful outing, finishing with a quality start of sixth innings, one earned run, five hits, one walk and four strikeouts. Odell threw 93 pitches, faced 23 batters and finished with a no decision.
“For most of the game, it really just takes a lot of pressure off your offense. Just to play free and have the right approach every at bat and we know that the guy on the mound for us has our back and we can just play together,” said Frechette.
The game was a day of offense as five Colonials recorded two or more hits, and every starter got on base at least once. Gates led the Colonials with three hits in five at-bats with one walk and one run batted in.
DiTomaso recorded two hits, one walk and one run batted in.
GW will head to Dayton, Ohio Friday and begin a three-game series against A-10 rival Dayton at 3 p.m.

At its core, the series illustrates how human relationships, morals and instincts come into conflict with one another, making the show so much deeper than your run-of-the-mill action-thriller.
When I received my first gaming console on my 14th birthday, I walked out of my local GameStop with a PlayStation 4 and the zombie apocalypse game that came with it. My group of middle school buddies who introduced me to the PS4 assured me that The Last of Us would change my life. I couldn’t get through the game without help after being freaked out by jumpscares, but they were ultimately right about how impactful The Last of Us was. And while skeptics raised their eyebrows at HBO Max’s plans to adapt a zombie-apocalypse video game into a TV series, gamers – myself included – thought the decision was a no-brainer.
At the start of “The Last of Us,” we enter a world ravaged by a global plague. Viewers watch our protagonist, Joel Miller, kick some zombie ass and develop a father-daughter relationship with Ellie Williams, the headstrong, 14-year-old girl whose immunity to zombies is the supposed key to saving the world from an undead end. But at its core, the series illustrates how human relationships, morals and instincts come into conflict with one another, making the show so much deeper than your run-of-the-mill action-thriller. The show flawlessly tackles deeply philosophical themes amid the comic-like backdrop, and this unpredictable contrast elevates its impact to a level of genius.
One of the plotlines of the show that stuck with me the most is its argument that love can be both the biggest determinant of and the greatest threat to survival in this post-apocalyptic world. The third episode of the series, “Long, Long Time,” establishes this foundational concept pointedly. The highly talked about episode delves into the love story of Bill and Frank, Joel’s old friends whom he and Ellie journey to during their cross-country mission to save the world. Viewers initially wonder why the storyline deviates to the life of two side characters but by the end of the episode, are only concerned with running for a box of tissues after becoming a sobbing mess.
From the episode’s striking storyline to its LGBTQ+ representation and heart-wrenching Shakespearean elements, showrunners defy expectations to bring viewers like me to tears. The two characters are introduced as polar opposites of each other – Bill a brute, nihilistic survivalist and Frank an optimistic, trusting soul. They successfully build some semblance of a wonderful life in contrast to the morbid loss that envelopes their chaotic time. Even at the end of the episode, when I expected Bill to quietly accept a life without Frank, I was shell-shocked at their unified end.
Similarly, in episode five, “Endure and Survive,” we again deviate to the backstory of characters. We meet Henry and Sam, a sibling duo destined to help our protagonists later in the show. We learn that Henry has chosen murder and betrayal to protect his little brother from the zombie apocalypse. Henry decides that, above all else, Sam is his purpose.
When I finished the series, I wondered why I couldn’t stop thinking about these stories and the impossible conflicts characters like Joel, Henry and Bill faced. My attachment finally clicked while listening to game creator Neil Druckmann discuss his intentions for these stories on the show’s companion podcast “HBO’s The Last of Us Podcast.” Druckmann explained that the notion of the unfailing, sacrificial and protective love these characters exhibit accustomed audiences to the theme of human relationships that becomes a through line in the series.
“Look at what Bill says to Frank, which is like, ‘You are my purpose,’ and this is even a further expression of that thought,” Druckmann said.
“The Last Us” illustrates the depth of human relationships – whether it be romantic, fraternal or father-daughter-like – in a way that prompts audiences to find themselves attached to characters like Ellie, Bill or Joel. I watched helplessly as my beloved anti-heroes were thrust into impossible situations, having to choose between love or survival, moral righteousness or vengeance and the greater good and protection of their own or personal safety. During the entire series, I grappled with these concepts as if I were in the shoes of Joel or Bill or Henry. I asked myself, “What would I have done in their situation? Are they justified? Can I really condemn them?”
The answers were never clear, and it’s this conflict and moral ambiguity that sets the show apart from others. It’s what kept me engaged from the show’s heartbreaking opening sequence to the shocking last seconds of the series finale, and it’s what elevated the video game of the decade to become one of the most poignant stories of our lifetime.

There was zero vision behind Vision Zero, D.C.’s plan to eliminate all traffic fatalities in the city by 2024. The program “lacked the infrastructure, funding and oversight,” to engineer safer roads in the city through the District Department of Transportation, according to a report by the Office of the D.C. Auditor released earlier this month.
The audit specifically focused on how DDOT’s management of the city’s roads has affected traffic fatalities, while a second audit will take a closer look at how the city enforces traffic safety. But to anyone who knew where to look, it was clear Vision Zero’s major objective had already failed from the outset in 2015.
This report has been a long time coming. Over 200 District and area residents concerned about rising traffic fatalities and the cost to D.C. taxpayers requested an audit in October 2018. Dave Salovesh, a member of D.C.’s cycling community and advocate for cycling infrastructure, was one of them. Six months after he signed the petition, the driver of a stolen van struck and killed Salovesh. He was one of 27 people to die in a traffic collision that year.
Before Vision Zero began in 2015, traffic deaths fell from 54 in 2007 to a low of 19 in 2012 before climbing back up to 26 in 2014. Since the initiative’s 2015 launch, 224 people had died through 2021 while the auditor’s report was authored. That number has since increased to 259 people – drivers and passengers, pedestrians and cyclists, parents and children who have died on the city’s streets since the conception of the city’s initiative to eliminate traffic deaths. And except for 2019 and 2022, traffic fatalities in the city have actually increased year-over-year during that time span.
But that increase isn’t equal across the entire District – traffic fatalities disproportionately occur in the city’s lower-income communities. There were 41 and 48 traffic fatalities in Wards 7 and 8, respectively, out of 213 fatalities citywide between 2017, the earliest year on record for D.C.’s Fatal and Injury Crashes Dashboard, and 2023. There were only six traffic fatalities in Ward 3 in the same period.
Now, it’s not as if Vision Zero has made the city’s streets more dangerous. Those rising death tolls mirror national trends, especially during COVID-19. But the program hasn’t made it any safer to travel around the District – which is precisely the one thing it was meant to do.
Vision Zero was and is the “Green New Deal” of transportation policy. They’re both grab bags of much-needed, transformational ideas tied with a bow of memorable messaging, but neither are impossible to achieve.
While Hoboken, New Jersey’s 60,000 residents pale in comparison to the 700,000 people who call D.C. home, there wasn’t a single traffic fatality in the city between 2018 and 2022. Mayor Ravi Bhalla inaugurated Hoboken’s Vision Zero plan in 2019, working with local officials, community members and advocacy groups to eliminate traffic deaths in the city by 2030. Under Bhalla, Hoboken has installed flexible posts to prevent cars from parking too close to crosswalks, slowed vehicle traffic with larger curbs and narrower streets and given pedestrians more time to cross the street ahead of cars.
Closer to home, the District has successfully identified and improved roadways with the most deaths and injuries throughout its “High Injury Network.” Though city officials lowered the city’s default speed limit to 20 mph and added traffic cameras and stop lights in 2020, they balked at fully funding Vision Zero. D.C.’s chief financial officer estimated the program would cost approximately $41.7 million in fiscal year 2021 and $171 million over the next four years, waylaying more expensive plans – like including sidewalks on both sides of any road DDOT improved – in favor of low- to no-cost policies.
From the time Vision Zero set out to eliminate all traffic fatalities in D.C. to now, just a few months before its target to do so in 2024, there has not been much to celebrate. The city’s progress on the initiative was too little, too late and too slow.
Though Bowser has proposed and the D.C. Council has approved millions in spending for Vision Zero through city agencies since 2015, it’s still fallen short of what the program actually needs to achieve its mission. DDOT’s internal division of Vision Zero, which was supposed to develop the traffic safety strategies and analyze the data at the core of the program, wasn’t created until fiscal year 2019 and didn’t receive a dollar of funding until fiscal year 2020. And it doesn’t make it easier to track D.C.’s total financial commitment to achieving Vision Zero when the city’s transportation and traffic policy is split between DDOT, the Metropolitan Police Department and the D.C. Department of Public Works and countless divisions within all three agencies.
And now, D.C. seems poised to enter a period of austerity to address growing expenses and falling revenues. The mayor also wants to use more than $500 million of fines from traffic cameras – money that’s supposed to fund traffic safety improvements in line with Vision Zero – to balance the rest of her budget.
I don’t know what the future of Vision Zero will look like. But I do know you can see where Vision Zero failed in roadside memorials like the one on 21st and I streets. And you can hear its unfulfilled promise in the wailing of sirens in the night. Accidents happen – not realizing Vision Zero to its fullest potential was one of them.

Though it was packed in a box for 15 minutes on the train, Doro’s food still hit the mark. 
Since opening its doors in November, Doro has been frying up classic American soul food, but with a distinct Ethiopian twist.
Doro is the brainchild of Ethiopian-born Elias Tadesse, an award winning chef who is working to fuse the flavors of his African heritage with D.C.’s local culture. His newest creations at Doro combine classic dishes from the American south with bold Ethiopian flavors and spice combinations that he grew up enjoying.
Located just one transfer and 10 stops away from GW at the Shaw/Howard U Metro station, Doro is one of the newest additions to the virtual resultant scene, which has taken the nation by storm during the pandemic. Like other virtual restaurants, Doro offers no seating for diners and operates on a takeout- and delivery-only format. The eatery shares its kitchen with two other businesses – Motown Square, a pizza place, and Prescription Chicken, another fried chicken restaurant.
The three restaurants share a youthful and laid-back aesthetic, which is reflected through their personal cartoon logos which are painted on the window. The inside of the restaurant is painted with a nostalgic blue and pink color scheme. The waiting area, made up of just four metal stools, accompanies a countertop that is home to a host of greenery, which is the perfect foreground for a window which looks out on the streets of the neighborhood. The space captures the spirit of Doro perfectly. It isn’t traditional fine dining, but a modernist take on the American tradition that is soul food.
Doro’s marriage between soul and Ethiopian cuisine is reflected through its menu offerings. A two-piece plate of chicken ($9), or a chicken sandwich ($10) are peppered with traditional Ethiopian spices, like the berbere spice blend that includes more than a dozen spices like cinnamon, cumin, fenugreek and paprika. The mac and cheese, ($5) an American soul food staple, is spiced with Doro Wat, a spicy, red Ethiopian spice blend. Doro also offers one dessert, a Mango pudding ($8), that comes with wafers and vanilla creme.
If there’s one thing Tadesse is known for, it’s innovating food, so I knew I had to get something out of the box. The very friendly staff that took my order were eager to assist in helping a newbie like me understand the complexities of Ethiopian food and explain to me the ins and outs of the menu. With their help, I went with the vegan tender plate ($9). The plate came with three tenders, which were made with a jackfruit and pea protein mix, and a side of berbere fries. There were three spice-level options for all food in Doro. Naked, which is mild, berbere, which is hot, or Mit Mita, which is very hot. As a big fan of spicy food, I had to get my tenders very hot.
Due to Doro’s lack of seating options as a virtual restaurant and the surrounding area’s distinct lack of outdoor seating, I decided to Metro a couple of stops south to Archives to dig into the food and enjoy the warm weather.
Though it was packed in a box for 15 minutes on the train, Doro’s food still hit the mark. Its combination of soul food and Ethiopian flavors is the perfect slice of gastronomic heaven. For me, Doro is the ultimate fusion food. It doesn’t change the flavors of soul food, but instead feels like the natural next step for soul food as a genre. It utilizes bold Ethiopian flavors to take soul food to another level instead of changing what soul food fundamentally is.
The berbere fries that came with the meal were an upgrade to classic french fries – coated in berbere spices, which gave them an exciting new personality that I have not tasted in french fries before. They were crisp and had a subtle, sweet flavor from the spice blend, which includes cloves, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg.
My mistake was assuming that the vegan tenders, the star of the show, were supposed to be a chicken substitute. The vegan tenders were never trying to be chicken tenders, but rather their own category of tender. The jackfruit and pea protein mix is a more whole-food-based approach to meat alternatives, some of which are packed with artificial chemicals, and had a pleasant texture. Despite the claim of very spicy, the tenders were not mind-numbingly spicy, but the cayenne-chile pepper flavor added a nice kick to the tenders which were already braised in spices such as turmeric, garlic and cardamom – all present in the berbere mix – before their baptism in the fryer. All the intricacies of Doro combine to make it a truly one-of-a-kind experience.
Though next time, I will order ahead to avoid a wait, Doro is still one of my favorite fast soul food restaurants in D.C. Its unapologetic approach is attractively delicious and has created a signature Ethiopian-American flavor combination.

The scheduling of the election follows interns and residents within the school filing election paperwork with the National Labor Relations Board last week.
Medical residents at the School of Medicine and Health Sciences have filed a petition to form a union and are expected to schedule their upcoming election “by the end of the week,” a union official said Wednesday.
Annie Della Fera, a communications director for the Committee of Interns and Residents – a local of the Service Employees International Union – said that more than 450 GW residents, interns and fellows are expected to schedule a vote to unionize in an effort to better wages and conditions to prevent physician burnout. The finalization of the election agreement follows interns and residents within the school filing election paperwork with the National Labor Relations Board last week.
Della Fera said medical residents and interns are seeking to form a union to improve wages and protect time off for staff to pursue mental health support and other medical care. She said residents and interns earn wages that reportedly fail to cover their living expenses some months in one of the “most expensive” metropolitan areas in the country despite some working more than 80 hours a week.
“They just want an avenue to be able to advocate to the administration so that they’re listened to and that they can actually make changes happen that’ll improve their lives, their working conditions and their ability to care for patients,” Della Fera said. 
SMHS residents and unions will join schools across the country that have recently announced plans to form unions, including two Penn Medicine hospitals, Montefiore hospital in New York and Mass General Brigham in Boston.  
She said the COVID-19 pandemic caused a “health care crisis” that stretched residents and interns to their limit because they provided the majority of patient care during the period, sparking the unionization effort. Della Fera said during the pandemic, resident physicians faced “trouble” and lacked “leverage” while advocating for improvements to management because they were still undergoing training as medical school students.
Della Fera said mental health is “really important” to residents and interns because of their “intense” workplace environment that leaves little to no time for processing grief. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 93 percent of health workers reported being burned out and stretched too thin during the pandemic in 2020.   
“It doesn’t really matter that they’re in a training program,” Della Fera said. “A lot of different jobs have training programs, they’re still providing, they’re still working, they’re still workers.”
She said officials first submitted their union petition paperwork for a mail-in election to the NLRB March 3 but withdrew it and then re-submitted the paperwork March 22 to petition for in-person voting.
SMHS Dean Barbara Bass said in an email to SMHS resident physicians earlier this month that the University will follow the processes set forth by the NLRB, including election procedures under which residents and interns can vote to elect a union via secret ballot. She said the medical school believes the decision to vote for union representation is a “personal decision” for each individual.
Bass said the medical school is “grateful” for residents’ contributions to patient health and wellness and that officials remain “committed” to working together with residents to ensure they have a “meaningful and successful” experience at GW.
“Resident physicians are an important part of our GW community,” the statement reads. “We embrace our mission to train the next generation of physicians, ensuring you develop the competencies you will need as independent physicians through our diverse and comprehensive training programs.”
University spokesperson Julia Metjian declined to comment earlier this month on when officials became aware of residents’ intent to form a union and what concerns they have brought forth, deferring to the Bass email. 
Maryssa Miller, a first-year internal medicine resident physician, said residents and interns all have their own reasons for forming a union but that many hope to receive “adequate” access to health care and mental health resources and a “livable” salary that prevents “worry” about paying bills every month. She said “most” residents reportedly have upward of $300,000 in student loans, an amount that’s difficult to pay off on the resident salary.
“We want the best resources to be able to serve the D.C. and DMV community, and we realize that in order to best serve our patients, we have to be able to take care of ourselves,” Miller said in an interview earlier this month. 
She said residents and interns also want to negotiate for patient-care funds that provide improved resources for patients and better access to childcare or parental leave, as well as allocate more money, time and effort to improving the diversity amongst the medical training residents and fellows. 
She said living through a global pandemic brought out many of the health care system’s  “inequalities” and “injustices” that made residents and fellows advocate for their training, colleagues and patients. She said GW medical students have been wanting to organize a union since at least 2018.
“It’s been really inspiring to us to see all of these other residency programs, stand up and unionize and basically paved the way for us,” Miller said. “We hope that by us unionizing, we can help pave the way for other programs to step up and fight for what they deserve as well.”

“Daisy Jones and the Six” ultimately fails to harness an intriguing story to make any kind of a genuine commentary on fame, Hollywood or the hedonism of the 60s and 70s. 
Even the allure of the rock-and-roll music world of the 1960s and 70s can’t save Amazon Prime’s newest entertaining-yet-contrived 10-episode show “Daisy Jones and the Six” from falling into age-old character tropes and tired soap-opera cliches.
The series – based on Taylor Jenkins Reid’s 2019 novel of the same name and produced by Reese Witherspoon – premiered March 3 and has gained enormous traction for its portrayal of a rock band loosely based on the storied chronicles of the iconic 70s rock band Fleetwood Mac. Filmed in a mockumentary style, “Daisy Jones and the Six” details the formation, rise and fall of a band – Daisy Jones and The Six – that took the Los Angeles music scene by storm in 1967.
Starring Riley Keough – Elvis’ granddaughter – as the elusive Daisy Jones and Sam Claflin as troubled Billy Dunne, the show is packed with tormented rockstars, complicated romances and drug-fueled drama. Daisy and Billy, who initially despise each other, eventually fall into a passionate and toxic – albeit artistically productive – romance. As they rise to fame, they write songs to and about each other and perform them with their band of six amid tense personal conflict arising from their tumultuous relationship. As much as this classic star-crossed lovers narrative is the center of the story, it is hardly felt through the dialogue or acting. Claflin and Keough have mediocre chemistry – Keough’s strong acting performance carries the brunt of the relationship, while Claflin’s serves only to simplify it.
Daisy’s character – talented, troubled and fiercely independent – is enjoyable to watch, but the writing ultimately fails to depict her as her own person. Daisy lives by her own rules, skeptical of forming relationships with anyone and opposed to compromising her own desires in favor for someone else’s. The character is meant to emulate Stevie Nicks, the frontwoman of Fleetwood Mac. But in an attempt to replicate a figure that pop culture views as one of a kind, the show fails in creating a persona for Daisy of her own, using a preexisting template of a troubled genius rather than an authentic characterization. Even Keough’s thorough, magnetic and impassioned acting performance can’t bring the true Daisy out of her simplified void.
Claflin is far less applaudable. Billy’s tortured character is meant to express his emotions without feeling them, but Claflin fails to paint a portrait of a Billy who can draw empathy from a viewer. The series only explores Daisy and Billy’s traumas – Billy’s absentee father and Daisy’s loveless mother – briefly in the first episodes, but we know very little about their backgrounds save a few scenes in Episodes 1 and 2. These mistakes in the crafting of each protagonist along with weak writing make both Billy and Daisy generally unlikeable – so much so that it becomes hard to feel invested in their lives, let alone their love story.
Billy’s high-school-sweetheart-turned-wife, Camila Alvarez – played by Camila Morrone – only complicates his relationship with Daisy. She is a loyal partner and mother to Billy’s daughter, sticking with Billy through his struggle with alcoholism and even looking past his obvious romance with Daisy. Camila, although not a member, is a central component of the band, providing support to her husband and his bandmates through thick and thin. She also provides emotional support for the other women on the show, counseling them as a pillar of strength. But Camila falls into a one-dimensional female character trope as the unflinching wife, friend and mother whose storylines only exist to enrich male characters’ stories.
Despite their lack of screen time, the side characters shine in the series. Will Harrison portrays Graham Dunne, Billy’s brother and the band’s guitarist, while Suki Waterhouse plays his secret love interest Karen Sirko, a British keyboardist who the band recruits early in the show. The pair serve as the only fully likable characters in the entire show, yet the writers give the audience little content to dissect – their personalities are relatable, but are solely addressed in a few well-crafted scenes that are too brief and scarce to explore anything deeply.
The clever mockumentary style switches between shots of the main characters in the 1990s reflecting on the past and scenes of the 1970s as they occurred, following the documentary format of the novel. The interview scenes make sense for the story, but it’s not worth the frequent detour from the meat of the story set in the 1970s. The costumes and sets are more of an homage to the 70s as opposed to an accurate depiction, but they nevertheless successfully pulled the viewers into the world by emulating the recognizable time period.
The cast recorded and released a full record, “Aurora,” with lyrics written by Grammy-nominee Phoebe Bridgers and Grammy-winner Blake Mills. The album doesn’t quite capture the symbolism or mystique of Fleetwood Mac records, but Keough’s powerful vocals alongside the talented band come together to create several incredibly catchy songs and a cohesive project about heartbreak, love and loneliness. “Daisy Jones and The Six” became the first fictional band to reach No. 1 on iTunes this month for “Aurora,” but the album lacks the essence that would prompt the kind of groupie hysteria the show depicts – Fleetwood Mac’s legendary legacy is difficult to emulate.
“Daisy Jones and the Six” ultimately fails to harness an intriguing story to make any kind of a genuine commentary on fame, Hollywood or the hedonism of the 60s and 70s. Instead, the creators focus their energy entirely on fulfilling, age-old cliches. The novel isn’t meant to be a layered commentary on the perils of fame, but given the enthralling history of the band it’s based on, the show passes up the opportunity to weigh in any meaningful way on the themes of fame, celebrity culture and drug use. Rather than framing and analyzing the fascinating cultural zeitgeists of California in the 1970s, the show merely uses it as a setting for a love story that’s been done – and better – many times.
Despite the tired love triangles, mediocre acting and rushed storylines that characterized much of the show, it never failed to entertain, managing to capture the tension and drama of the rock n’ roll world. “Daisy Jones and the Six” is a fun watch, but not a serious one.
