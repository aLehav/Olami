Emily Irvine, the social chair of the women’s Rugby Football Club, said some members have been unclear on funding application deadlines. 
Several club sports teams struggled securing practice space and equipment because of a drop-off in funding after returning in full swing this semester in light of shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Half a dozen members of club sports teams said their funding from the Student Association has decreased as a result of the SA’s shrunken budget this year, receiving remaining funding from the Office of Campus Recreation and forcing them to host their own fundraisers to finance their sports. They said limited practice space and a lack of communication with officials about booking practice space has damaged their membership levels and day-to-day operations.
Aubre Jones, the director of recreational sports, said concerns from club sports about access to practice spaces arise because of a lack of space around GW’s urban location which also affects varsity sports on campus. He said adding lights to the Mount Vernon Campus fields could extend the number of hours the field is used and add to available practice space.
Jones said club teams request practice spaces through the scheduling office in the University Student Center or through the Office of Campus Recreation. He said club sports funding from the SA varies by year, and campus recreation allocations have consistently hovered at $75,000 during the past five years.
He said 16 teams practice at off-campus facilities not owned by GW, 10 practice in the Lerner Health and Wellness Center, nine practice on the Mount Vernon Campus, eight regularly practice in the Smith Center and two practice in other GW buildings.
“The lack of space not only affects the sport clubs at GW, it also has varsity sports at GW like Baseball, Water Polo and Gymnastics traveling off-campus to practice,” he said in an email.
Senior Emily Irvine, the social chair of the women’s Rugby Football Club, said the University has not clearly outlined when to meet funding request deadlines, leaving some members confused about the process. The rugby club received $3,150 of its nearly $7,000 funding request from the SA this year after raking in $3,650 from the SA in 2019, according to the SA budget book.
“The school’s not being super helpful in terms of helping us help ourselves,” Irvine said. “A lot of us were sophomores. We came back and now we run our club.”
She said daylight savings shortened how long the team can practice outside before it gets dark on the Mount Vernon Campus, where fields lack lighting and often cut practices short. She said the team also meets in the Lerner Health and Wellness Center but must coordinate with other teams’ schedules, making it more difficult to find open practice slots.
“We’re headed into a match this weekend, and I’m kind of worried about it,” Irvine said. “I have class until six. I haven’t been to practice in two weeks. It’s over by the time I’m out of class.”
Senior Carrie Kowalyk, the co-president of GW Women’s Club Volleyball, said the team practiced at least three times a week before the pandemic, but members now struggle to log two weekly practices because of the limited hours and space in the Smith Center and Lerner, which are occupied by varsity sports who take precedence from the University. The team’s funding this year remained nearly consistent with its 2019 level surpassing $4,000 but falling about $10,000 short of its request this fall.
Kowalyk said a lack of guidance from officials has been inconvenient for players and caused stress for e-board members who have been left searching for solutions on their own.
“I didn’t sign up to be a logistics coordinator and a volleyball president,” Kowalyk said. “It’s becoming 10 times the work that it would have been before the pandemic because they don’t have any of their processes in place.”
She said team members hosted fundraisers in hopes of affording rental cars, flights and hotel rooms for when they travel to competitions. She said the team is required to hire a security guard to enforce the mask mandate at tournaments hosted at the University, which has made travel expenses even more unaffordable.
“We got $700 to be in Phoenix for four days,” Kowalyk said. “That’s not going to cover it.”
Junior Dorsey Ducharme, the president of GW Club Tennis, said the staff member who used to assign teams tennis court space on the Vern before the pandemic is no longer employed by the University. He said no one has filled the position and scheduling practice times on the courts has become more of a challenge.
He said officials have failed to monitor and clean the tennis courts, where unkempt facilities and broken nets have discouraged members from attending practices. The tennis team’s funding from the SA plummeted this year, totaling less than $600, down from more than $2,200 in 2019, according to the SA budget book.
“People aren’t as willing to come to practice anymore because it’s very clear the facilities aren’t being taken care of,” Ducharme said. “We probably have the worst practice turnout since I have been here as a student.”
Ducharme said the team cannot host any tournaments at GW because of the state of the facilities, forcing the club to travel to other universities.
“You can’t have a tennis center with no one working there,” Ducharme said. “There’s no guidance or authority figure running the courts at all.”
Senior Colin Rosadino, the president of Club Baseball, said the team lacks sufficient funding from the SA. He said the team, which practices on the Vern’s softball field without any baseball field on campus, has been strained waiting for funding that’s distributed after the season starts.
Club Baseball’s funding from the SA increased to more than $7,300 this year, up from about $4,700 in 2019, according to the SA budget book. The team’s package came nearly $10,000 short of its request this fall, the book shows.
“We just don’t have the resources we need to practice at the level we want to practice at so when we get to games we can play at the same level as the teams we’re playing,” Rosadino said.

After an injury caused Doak to leave behind her gymnastics career, she said she incorporated much of what she had previously learned in her diving. 
Junior diver Jamie Doak set a pair of program records last month, smashing a two-decade-old record held by an alumna.
Doak set a new record on the one-meter board with a score of 279.23, smashing the previous record set by alumna Lynne McCormick in 2001, while also landing the five-dive platform record score of 210.60 against Pittsburgh. Doak placed third in the one-meter and the three-meter and finished sixth on platform in addition to meeting the NCAA Zones qualifying standard on the one-meter for the second time this season.
“It was really exciting,” Doak said. “I wasn’t expecting it, and we actually didn’t think I broke the record until later that night, which was fun, because I knew I’d broken the tower record, but the one meter record just seemed out of reach for a while until Friday.”
Doak became a diver after an injury led her to leave gymnastics her freshman year of high school. She was drawn to diving because she knew another gymnast who had made the switch to the aquatic sport.
She said much of what she had learned from gymnastics translated to diving.
“I have a lot of the skills that came with it, just being able to work through your fears and the actual flipping and twisting that you have to do,” Doak said. “But diving has brought a whole new perspective of it all, because there’s a little less impact on injury – I’m not gonna die if I mess up, where in gymnastics, you will.”
Doak said the sport has helped her mature as a person and learn to “take everything as it goes.”
“There’s always things that are changing so you have to be able to adapt,” Doak said. “I think that’s really helped me with that and becoming a little less type A and needing to know everything, have a perfect schedule that’s going to work out how I want it to be.”
After returning from an ACL injury she incurred in her freshman year, Doak made her GW debut last season at the A-10 Championships, nabbing a bronze medal on the three-meter board, posting a score of 282.40 that helped the women’s squad finish in fourth place. She also qualified for the A final on the one meter before placing eighth with a score of 241.80.
Head diving coach Christopher Lane said he has been working with Doak on maintaining consistency in hurdles and takeoffs as the season progresses. He said the team is looking to contend for the A-10 conference title but is also hoping to get Doak to the NCAA tournament this year.
“It’s still the beginning of the season,” Lane said. “And I think that the trajectory that we’re on, I would expect that we will probably be breaking this record several times. I think that this is probably just the first of many records that will come, that will be broken this year.”
Lane, who was a volunteer assistant for two years prior to his head coaching position, said he is excited for the remainder of the season because he hadn’t had the chance to watch Jamie dive until this season. He said maintaining her health has been a “huge factor” in determining her success moving forward and is impressed with the work they’ve done together up to this point.
“This is the first record to go down,” Lane said. “But we have our eyes set on all the rest of those records and making sure that Jamie’s name stays up on that board for years to come.”
Doak will look to set even more records when the Colonials hit the pool once again at the NC State/GAC Invitational beginning Nov. 18.

For years, students have been demanding, pleading and beseeching the University to implement U-Pass. Now, at long last, that day has finally arrived. Starting in the new year, all undergraduate students will be automatically enrolled in the program for a $100-per-semester fee which will allow them unlimited rides on Metrorail and Metrobus. Graduate students will have the ability to opt out, but all in all, this policy will cover almost the entire student body.
U-Pass is an outstanding policy that’s been a long, long time coming. From saving students money to protecting the environment, this program is almost all upside.
The policy will affect almost all undergraduate students. The vast majority of students will take the Metro at some point, albeit with varying frequency. The University is located right on the Metro’s Orange, Silver and Blue lines, and part of the GW experience includes taking advantage of accessibility to other parts of D.C., like traveling to visit the Smithsonian museums or trying off-GWorld eateries.
For students who don’t typically have an incentive to travel outside of Foggy Bottom on the Metro, the new policy will serve as encouragement to explore more of the DMV. Students have criticized GW’s culture of living in a bubble for years now, discussing tensions between students living in the Foggy Bottom area and full-time residents of the city and calling out the University for its greedy approach to real estate and its subsequent effect on the community. U-Pass might be the impetus we need to harbor a more integrated culture between GW students and full-time inhabitants of the city.
For some, the Metro is a routine way of getting to campus and back home. The pandemic drove many students to seek off-campus housing and for the students who use the Metro day in and day out, the U-Pass announcement is a boon. Even those who live just one Metro stop away spend close to $5 daily on a round trip. The Metro offers monthly passes for regulars, but the discount is fairly minor and complicated by frustrating minutia, like the pass being limited to, at the very most, one calendar month depending on what day of the month one buys the pass.
The Metro is also a sustainable way to travel, and in GW’s pursuit to become greener, U-Pass contributes to that goal by providing an affordable alternative to Ubers, Lyfts or any other taxi service. Having a Metro pass on hand will encourage students to take public transit in situations when they otherwise might have called a car to take them to their destination.
But administrators should be cognizant of the fact that a $100 fee is not a trivial amount of money, especially for students who do not plan on using the Metro frequently. Sure, in the grand scheme of things, $100 might seem like a drop in the bucket compared to the total cost of attending GW in a given semester, but the University should still offer options to accommodate those who aren’t in a position to pay a fee for a service they didn’t ask for.
GW has some existing structures through which reimbursement for travel can take place. For example, the Knowledge In Action Career Internship Fund Travel Grants, also known as KACIF, offer students in an unpaid internship up to $300 in travel reimbursement. That program could be expanded, or a new program could be created in a similar mold, to cover the $100 U-Pass fee for students who demonstrate a financial need.
For many, many students, U-Pass is going to be a game-changer. This is a victory for the student activists who have been calling for this for years now – and the University should continue to listen to the demands of students. An institution that boasts about the jobs, internships and activities that its members do across the broader D.C. community has finally given its students a means to do that affordably.
And, of course, this gives GW the final leg up over American University.
The editorial board consists of Hatchet staff members and operates separately from the newsroom. This week’s staff editorial was written by opinions editor Andrew Sugrue and contributing opinions editor Shreeya Aranake based on discussions with culture editor Anna Boone, contributing sports editor Nuria Diaz, design editor Grace Miller and copy editor Jaden DiMauro. Assistant copy editor Karina Ochoa Berkley, who had worked on the U-Pass issue in a separate capacity, recused herself from this week’s discussion.

Officials adjusted their projections for the celebration’s costs as events shifted to in person this fall. 
GW’s bicentennial celebrations are forecasted to cost $2.8 million this fiscal year, more than double the budgeted amount, according to a Faculty Senate committee report released Friday.
Officials began celebrating the University’s bicentennial virtually in February and did not report any related spending last fiscal year, which ended June 30, according to the fiscal planning and budgeting committee’s report. But as campus reopened and celebrations moved in person this fall, costs were forecasted to surpass the $1.3 million budgeted this fiscal year based on the committee’s Aug. 31 projections.
Bicentennial celebrations culminated with a three-day, in-person Centuries Celebration Weekend last month after campus reopened.
Officials previously declined to provide the cost of the weekend-long celebration.
The culminating event also included a makeup Commencement held on the National Mall for the classes of 2020 and 2021, which was forecasted to cost $2.1 million, according to the report.
Joe Cordes, a faculty senator and the committee’s co-chair, said the University’s finances are “pretty good” overall – a sign that GW has largely “survived” the pandemic after last year’s budget cuts.
“This is not a university that right now is struggling financially,” Cordes said at the meeting.
The report forecasted a $10.1 million surplus this fiscal year, slightly above the budgeted amount. Faculty expressed concerns in April that the budget should direct more funds to research instead of setting aside money for a surplus.
The University’s stable financial footing comes after administrators implemented controversial cuts to close last fiscal year’s $180 million projected budget gap, vowing to reduce expenses instead of using the endowment. GW’s budget mitigation efforts included layoffs, a freeze on most hirings and capital projects and pay cuts for top administrators.
Ellen Zane, the chair of the Board of Trustees’ finance committee, said at a Board meeting last month that the University ultimately broke even on its net operating income last year as a result of the mitigation.
GW’s endowment grew by 30.8 percent during the fiscal year, totaling about $300 million, which Cordes called a “strong” performance.
“The market then turned around and has been very, very strong,” Cordes said. “The University has benefited from that. Its performance in this area has been comparable to that of other universities.”
Officials said last September that they planned to use up to $20 million in unrestricted assets to close the remainder of the gap. Officials ultimately only used about $10 million, which will be repaid over the next three years, according to the report.
Cordes’ report states that officials budgeted $8.4 million on pandemic mitigation efforts this fiscal year – including the cost of GW’s in-house COVID-19 testing – down from the $17.9 million budgeted last year. Officials have used roughly $20 million in funding from federal stimulus packages during the last year and a half to defray costs related to the pandemic.
The report also states that officials budgeted $1 million on dining lease buyouts, but they now project an expense of roughly $800,000. Officials announced plans in late August to revamp the University’s dining system with the addition of three new dining halls, one of which will be located in Shenkman Hall, where officials said they plan to allow current leases to expire.

Whether you decide to cook, host a potluck or order in, follow these tips to host a successful Friendsgiving. 
Thanksgiving is right around the corner, and with it comes the annual tradition of Friendsgiving.
Planning a Friendsgiving gathering includes several components: curating the menu, delegating which dishes each guest is responsible for and determining a location for the event. Use this guide to ensure you cover all the basis to host your best Friendsgiving yet.
Whether you’re in it for the friends or the food, we have you covered with these tips to planning a successful Friendsgiving:
Delegating responsibilities
Depending on the size of your group, a good rule of thumb is to ask each guest to bring one or two items. In addition to food, make sure to delegate drinks, dishes, utensils and decorations. As the host, you are already sharing your space, so it could be a good move to dole out most of the other food, drink and decoration responsibilities. Not every guest has to bring food or drinks – if some friends are doing the brunt of the cooking, have others take dish and cleanup duty.
Communication is key when it comes to planning a Friendsgiving, so keep in touch with your guests to keep the whole group up to date on plans and responsibilities. A group chat specifically for your Friendsgiving could help facilitate communication and even checklists are simple tools to ensure that nothing important is forgotten.
Shortcuts on labor-intensive dishes
If cooking a full turkey seems too advanced for you and your apartment or residence hall oven, you’re not alone. One option is to swing by the grocery store and grab one or two rotisserie chickens. Presented nicely on a platter, they evoke the same holiday feelings as a turkey with the added benefit of not laboring over the cooking for hours.
Pies are an essential part of every Thanksgiving meal, but making them can become labor intensive. Luckily Pelham Commons has you covered. See the cashier at Pelham to pre-order a 10-inch pie before Nov. 19 and enjoy one or more of the six flavor varieties at your Friendsgiving.
Options if you don’t want to cook
Cooking a Thanksgiving dinner, or even just one dish, can simply be too much for some college students, especially as we head into finals season. If your Friendsgiving is taking place on campus, then you could always put the Whole Foods hot bar to good use and pick up one of the pies that you always pass on the way to checkout but never have a reason to buy. Whole Foods also offers Thanksgiving catering for up to 12 people. Just make sure to put your order in 24 hours ahead of time.
For a less traditional meal, have everyone to bring one dish from their favorite restaurant for a buffet featuring an assortment of food from all around D.C. The Founding Farmers restaurants are also offering a specialty Thanksgiving menu ($42.99 per person).
Finding an ideal spot to host
Whether you’re in Foggy Bottom or your hometown for your Friendsgiving, a warm and mild fall day could give you the opportunity to host a picnic-style meal outside. If you are planning on being with your college friends in Foggy Bottom, the National Mall, U-Yard or the Capitol lawn could all make for good spaces. Find a picnic bench or a nice patch of grass, spread a table cloth and enjoy your meal.
Since bearable weather isn’t guaranteed, the key in finding an ideal hosting spot is a spacious kitchen, if you are planning on cooking, and a large table.
The cooking process can get rather chaotic with multiple chefs and dishes, so a large kitchen is ideal. A common kitchen in a residence hall or affinity housing could accommodate a bigger group. Eating and cooking in the same space can make things a bit easier and cut down on transportation time. Residence halls may be lacking in the table department, so you can always opt to sit on the floor in a circle or check out your building’s common room.
Mealtime activities
If your crew is feeling sentimental, go around in a circle with each person saying something they are thankful for about the person to their left. Similarly, take turns sharing one thing you are thankful for about the past year. Activities like these can bond your group further and foster some holiday spirit.
After everyone has gotten a little wine or spirit of choice in them, it could be the ideal time to bring out the karaoke. It’s the time of year where playing Christmas music is expected and acceptable, so turn on Mariah Carey and listen to your friends belt out their favorite verses.
If you’re looking for something with a slower pace after stuffing yourself full of your favorite Thanksgiving dishes, playing cards with a group is always a fun, easy option.
Holiday Decor
Decor is definitely optional, but it can help elevate the event. Lighting some candles, if the dinner is taking place off campus, displaying mini pumpkins on the table, playing holiday music or using Thanksgiving-themed plates and napkins can all add some extra ambiance. If you are feeling extra crafty, a great centerpiece idea is to fill a hollow pumpkin with flowers and use it as a festive vase to adorn your table.

Students can take advantage of a variety of resources around D.C. that promote sexual health. 
As a busy college student on a budget, it can be daunting and time consuming to find the right resources to meet your sexual health needs.
There are multiple affordable and accessible resources around D.C. where you can get tested for sexually transmitted infections and receive birth control, emergency contraception and information on safer sex practices. We’ve compiled information on five D.C. clinics and resource centers to help you better manage your sexual health when factors like money, time and fear of shame become barriers:
Foggy Bottom Plan B
Run by members of the GW community, Foggy Bottom Plan B is a donation-based organization independent of the University. Anyone in the Foggy Bottom area, not just students, can fill out a simple, confidential Google form to be delivered free, emergency contraception within 24 hours. On the form, you can indicate your preferences for delivery, like what semi-private space you’d like to meet at for your pick up, if you’d like condoms delivered with your emergency contraception and a preferred gender for the Foggy Bottom Plan B delivery volunteer. The organization delivers the medicine Preventza, which is taken as a one-dose pill meant to prevent pregnancy after birth control mishaps or unprotected sex. You can find extensive information about emergency contraception on the group’s website.
Planned Parenthood, Carol Whitehill Moses Center
Located at 1225 4th St. NE, just two blocks from the NoMa-Gallaudet U Metro station, this Planned Parenthood center provides services like testing and treatment for STIs, multiple birth control methods including internal and external condoms and LGBTQ+ resources like hormone replacement therapy. If you don’t have health insurance or Medicaid, you can get information on other government-funded programs or lower fee scale options. On its website, you can book appointments 24/7 without having to call the clinic, which is open from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday and Monday, until 6:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday and until 4:30 p.m. Thursday through Friday.
Whitman-Walker Health Clinic
The Whitman-Walker Health Clinic, located at 1525 14th St. NW in Logan Circle, is a good option if you need care quickly and it’s just a three-minute walk from the 14th Street & Rhode Island Avenue DC Circulator bus stop. Through its donation-funded business model, this clinic is able to provide people with free walk-in rapid HIV testing and free STI self-testing kits. You can also access free Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, commonly known as PrEP, a daily medicine meant to protect higher-risk demographics, like people engaging in anal sex, from contracting HIV. Post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, is also available as a combatting treatment if exposure to HIV is suspected. The clinic is open Monday through Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 5:30 p.m. and Fridays 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 5 p.m.
HIPS
This non-profit organization was established in 1996 as an outreach and counseling hotline service for people in the sex work industry. While HIPS has expanded to also offer harm reduction services and tools for drug users like Narcan, HIPS is still a valuable tool for anyone who engages in sex work. The HIPS drop-in center is located at 906 H St. NE, a two-minute walk from the Metrobus H & 8th streets NE stop. The center provides resources ranging from shower, laundry and bathroom facilities to gender inclusive safer sex materials, drug testing kits and clinical services. The facility is open from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday and Friday 1 to 4 p.m. You can also call its 24-hour hotline at 800-676-4477 for crisis help or emergency situations.
Sex Is…
This D.C. sponsored health campaign was launched in 2017 and aims to provide fact-based information through mainly online resources about sex, sexuality and sexual health to the youth of the city specifically. You don’t have to need immediate medical care to seek answers about your own sexual health. Sex Is… is an ideal resource for nonurgent information, like how the digital world can influence our sex lives, guidance on sexual assault and consent and even a sex podcast. The campaign also offers free condoms, internal and external, for local delivery, and all you have to do is fill out a simple form. You can even browse local medical providers by services offered and ward if you need in-person treatment or resources. While this is mainly an online resource, you can find resources about the campaign in the HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and TB Administration offices on the fourth floor of D.C. Department of Health building at 899 North Capitol St. NE.

Angela Davis delivered her keynote address virtually Thursday night as one of more than 20 sessions offered during the two-day summit. 
The Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement hosted the seventh annual Diversity Summit late last week, featuring more than 20 virtual sessions including a keynote address from Angela Davis.
Nearly 40 speakers including students, scholars and activists participated in the virtual summit Thursday and Friday, headlined by the theme “The Audacity of Hope, The Power in Community,” which sought to educate the University community to protect diverse identities and enhance racial equity across the country. The summit’s lineup featured distinguished civil rights activist Angela Davis who delivered the keynote address, speakers from GW and honorary guests Dr. Tony Keith and Rebecca Russo, who discussed issues ranging from policing’s effect on D.C. youth to the intersection between sexual violence and disability.
Davis rehashed her journey of advocacy from the Civil Rights Movement to modern-day racial justice issues, like prison abolition and intersectional discrimination and advocacy, during her address Thursday.
She said she has spent her career writing eight books about social justice issues and lecturing about civil rights throughout the United States, Europe, Africa, Australia and South America. She said as a child growing up in the Jim Crow south, she developed a life centered around resistance from a young age, recalling a game where her friends would dare each other to ring white people’s doorbells before running away.
“We even turned resistance into a game.” Davis said at the summit. “But most importantly, it became a way of life. It became the way in which we live our lives.”
Davis said Black feminists have faced an intersectionality of discrimination on the basis of race, gender and sexuality, evidence of how multiple identities have conceptualized “our place in the world.”
“Intersectionality is a particular formulation of the kind of interconnectedness and interrelatedness that Black feminists have been arguing for for a very long time,” she said.
Davis voiced her support for the prison abolition movement at the summit, saying that without prisons, people would be free to live their lives without the fear of oppression and harm.
“A world that would no longer need prisons and police for security would be a world in which people were happy and free and were able to explore their own individual desires and passions.” Davis said. “It would be a socialist world, let me put it that way.”
She said everyone comes from a community, which in turn will shape their individual personality, tying into this year’s theme invoking the power in community identities, relationships and voices. 
“​​We are all produced by communities, we would not exist as individuals if not for our communities.” she said.
Other speakers at the Diversity Summit discussed antisemitism, critical race theory and health concerns related to racial trauma as issues that affect community diversity.   
Sabrina Soffer, a freshman majoring in international politics and Judaic studies and an opinions writer for The Hatchet, spoke at an event about antisemitism and Jewish inclusion on campus Thursday, where she advocated for an increase in Holocaust education and more awareness about a recent rise in antisemitism across college campuses. 
Antisemitism resurfaced as a campus-wide discussion at GW after a Torah was desecrated at Tau Kappa Epsilon’s townhouse earlier this month, drawing hundreds of students to voice their support for the Jewish student population.
“We have to remember history in order to prevent what’s going on, especially because GW has a one-third Jewish population, but yet we have the second most cases of antisemitism across colleges in the nation.” Soffer said in an interview.
Following Russo’s presentation, a panel of faculty and administrators answered questions and explained available resources, like bias reporting, to address concerns about antisemitism at GW. Caroline Laguerre-Brown, the vice provost for diversity equity and community engagement, said on the panel that officials have a mission to build a more inclusive GW through these resources.
In response to a question from the audience regarding the summit’s theme of hope, Laguerre-Brown said that in the face of rising antisemitism, she finds hope in the GW student community.
“As the head of the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement, to be sure, the mission of the office is really every single day to work on as many fronts as we can to try to build a more inclusive GW,” she said.
Wendy Ellis, an assistant professor of global health and the director of the Center for Community Resilience in the Milken Institute School of Public Health, spoke during the closing event entitled “Trauma, Equity and Resilience: A Call to Action.” The discussion focused on trauma created by forms of systemic racism, like inequitable economic opportunity, social capital and housing affordability, which have oppressed and marginalized communities.
“When we hear community narratives, are we merely just looking at the outcome, or are we asking ourselves, ‘Is this also the experience of racism that we are seeing?’” she said at the event.
Ellis said community resilience is essential to break from cycles of trauma. Recounting her own childhood experiences with an abusive father who murdered her mother, Ellis said the resilience of her community and the availability of an education propelled her to where she is today.
“We know what equity means, we know what diversity looks like and we know the importance of inclusion,” she said. “So let’s get to work.”
Interim Provost Chris Bracey delivered a presentation about critical race theory, its origins and its inclusion in public school history curricula at an event Friday. Bracey said critical race theory originated in the legal field, and that the term acts as a verb in describing “one who engages in critical race theory” to learn more about the role of race and racism in society.
He said “critical race theorists” are examining how a rule, law or decision may disadvantage people of color.
Bracey said conservatives have worked to oppose critical race theory and its inclusion in public school history curricula, fearing it may negatively portray white people.
“Critical race theory seems to have risen from relative obscurity to front page news almost overnight,” Bracey said at the summit. 
He said this resistance has driven the growing attention toward critical race theory, but these conservative opponents who “have no clue” about the true meaning of the term are actually opposing the rise of multiculturalism.
“This is what the masses are reacting to – this prevailing perception that somehow critical race theory is threatening white privilege,” Bracey said.

The Colonials were able to keep the game close in the first quarter with a series of close shots, but the game got away from the team in the second half. 
Women’s basketball was dealt a blowout loss at the hands of No. 24 Virginia Tech Thursday night.
The Colonials (1-1) managed to keep the game close for much of the first half, but Virginia Tech (2-0) expanded their lead late in the second quarter, finishing with a final score of 75–38. Head Coach Caroline McCombs said the team was competing at a “high level” in places throughout the game and they will learn from their struggles in the second half of the game.
Virginia Tech Center Elizabeth Kitley dominated the game from start to finish, scoring 34 points and grabbing nine rebounds while shooting just over 80 percent from the field.
“She has some unguardable moves, so you just really try to not let her touch the ball as much as possible,” McCombs said. “But she’s a pretty good player. And she didn’t have a great game her first night out so she was probably trying to redeem herself.”
Kitley scored Virginia Tech’s first 14 points, converting all seven of her field goal attempts. Despite the Hokies’ hot start, GW was able to keep the game close in the first quarter due to an organized effort to generate close shots.
Redshirt junior forward Mayowa Taiwo scored 6 of her 10 total points in the first quarter alone, all off of layups. The Colonials scored all 14 of their first quarter points in the paint, which kept them within 5 points by the end of the first quarter trailing 19–14.
“I think we took some rushed shots, maybe some early shots, where if we allowed the offense to work, get it all the way through, we could have had some better execution there,” McCombs said.
In the second quarter, the Colonials pulled within a point of Virginia Tech when sophomore guard Aurea Gingras nailed a mid-range jump shot to put the score at 18-19 with 8:39 left. The Hokies responded by going on a 16-2 run before sophomore guard Taylor Webster hit a corner 3-pointer with three seconds left in the half, resulting in a halftime score of 35-23.
GW shot 40.7 percent from the floor in the first half overall compared to Virginia Tech’s 51.7 percent. Webster was a bright spot in GW’s offense, scoring 9 points in the first half on an efficient 4-of-6 from the field, while knocking down her only attempted three of the half as well.
But graduate student forward Ty Moore, who scored 18 points and snatched 11 rebounds in Tuesday’s home opener victory over American, quickly got into foul trouble after racking up three fouls in only seven minutes of first half play, taking her out of rhythm and eliminating a crucial offensive weapon for the Colonials throughout much of the game.
“It’s our second game coaching her. We obviously saw two different things today and sometimes you’re on the bench for a while, you get cold, and she was just trying to come in and make a play,” McCombs said.
In the third quarter, Virginia Tech extended their lead to 29 through the continued dominance of Kitley as well as a productive 4-of-6 shooting from 3-point range, including two from senior guard Kayana Traylor. GW scored just 9 points in the third quarter compared to Virginia Tech’s 26 and shot at a .308 clip compared to the Hokies’ .611, suffering a scoring drought from 5:15-1:48 left in the quarter.
“They’re just a really good team inside out, they shoot a lot of threes,” McCombs said. “Their big kid went off on us and we’d rather have them making twos than threes, but they got hot from both sides.”
Virginia Tech also outrebounded GW in the third quarter, grabbing 13 rebounds compared to GW’s three rebounds as well as four offensive rebounds that led to 6 second chance points.
“We talked about that after the game, just that we need to rebound the ball, we need to give better effort on the glass,” McCombs said. “That’s typically who we are, at least what we’ve shown to this point in time, in many of our scrimmages and in our first game so we’ve got to gang rebound. We got to get that from everybody.”
By the end of the third, the Hokies were up 61–32. Virginia Tech continued to apply the pressure, expanding their lead in the fourth quarter, going up by as many as 34 points before finishing the game up by a margin of 27 with a final score of 75–38.
“We’ve got to learn,” McCombs said. “The offense is going to take time, the defense still has a ways to improve. When we scout each team that we’re going to face we’ll do some different things and I think you see those things throughout the course of your non-conference schedule.”
The Colonials will face Old Dominion on the road Thursday, Nov. 14. Tipoff is slated for 6:30 p.m.
