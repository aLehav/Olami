The University has set aside $5.3 million for sustainable building upgrades this year in the first phase of a massive replacement of out-of-date systems and fixtures across campus.
The renovations will cover buildings like Gelman Library and Lisner Auditorium and largely retrofit existing systems to reduce GW’s energy use and cut costs, Meghan Chapple-Brown, the director of the Office of Sustainability, said.
With more efficient heating and cooling systems and less wasteful water systems, the University will come closer to its goal of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2025 – a goal outlined in the 2010 Climate Action Plan.
The investment will be repaid within seven years at a rate of about $800,000 a year, and the energy savings will be the equivalent of “removing a large building from GW’s campus, or two large residence halls,” University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said.
The crew began adding eco-friendly amenities to buildings in July, with more rolling out this semester, like motion sensor lights, motors, low-flow toilets, eco-friendly power strips and monitored air conditioning controls. Sherrard said most of the lighting and “simpler projects” will wrap up by December, with work finishing by the end of 2013.
Phase one of the project includes the H Street block between 21 and 22nd streets, and the rest of construction will be planned block-by-block, Chapple-Brown said. The office is still mapping out a timetable for the entire project.
The plan was born out of the Innovation Task Force, a committee that explores cost-cutting and revenue-enhancing strategies across GW. Chapple-Brown said the project raised a question about how to fund retrofitting projects because they do not count as new construction or maintenance like other building projects, but GW ultimately makes up the cost through lower energy bills.
She said the University invested in the project separately from its annual capital and operating budget. Sherrard declined to provide specifics about where the funding came from for the project.
This is the first major project to come out of the partnership between the Office of Sustainability and the Division of Operations, the office that oversees facilities and construction.
The sustainability office also paired with staff at the Division of Information Technology to set up the software and systems to monitor the carbon emission savings, a cooperation that further cut back costs for GW.
Many universities put these types of projects in place through external groups, Chapple-Brown said, paying contractors up to 30 percent of the project cost.
“The advantage we have is that we have the internal expertise because we’ve taken a couple of years to figure it out, so that significantly reduces our cost. We don’t have to hire somebody to do it,“ she said.

The University has set its sights on expanding academics and research in India, a rising global power that program directors say should make up a bigger part of GW’s international focus.
Associate Provost for International Programs Donna Scarboro said she met with a U.S. State Department official last week to discuss the agency’s “Passport to India” program, which incentivizes student travel to India through research projects, grant opportunities and dual degrees.
Details of GW’s development in India – even areas of research, types of programs, locations and funding – have not been worked out yet, Scarboro said. She said her office would need to identify a group of in-house experts who could advise on the country’s cultural nuances.
“If you ask why India is important to GW, you’re asking the question why India important [to the world],” she said. “That’s why I want to move students through there, so they can answer the question of why is India important in the world and what are India’s struggles and strengths and hopes. They can have a nuanced picture of that country.”
Nationally, India typically sends the second-most students to the U.S. behind China. But with 27 undergraduates and 222 graduate students at GW last year, India trails China and South Korea as the largest feeder countries at GW.
“It’s not just about moving students and faculty around – it’s about having an impact on important issues that affect that region,” Scarboro added. “We want to know what the issues are.”
The University already has research centers on Indian studies through the GW Law School and the Elliott School.
Shelley Gentry Jessee, a study abroad adviser, said the University’s connections with India have swelled in the last three years, with new study abroad possibilities in Delhi, Pune and Hyderabad.
But only 23 students, including graduate students, chose to study abroad in India two years ago, with “steady” interest of about four students per semester in the country for the past three years, Jessee said.
“India is still a non-traditional destination and a developing country,” she said. “Not all students are prepared for the cultural differences India presents and choose to study in other, more popular study abroad destinations.”
GW will need to grow in India whether or not the country is identified as a site for expansion in its strategic plan, which administrators will release Tuesday, Scarboro said. Officials involved with the plan have so far floated expansions in China, France, Brazil and sub-Saharan African countries as possible areas of attention.
Several schools that GW considers its peers have extensive programs and exchanges in India. Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business runs corporate education programs in the city of Ahmedabad in western India, and Northwestern University’s McCormick School of Engineering works with top technology firms in Mumbai.
The new attention toward India comes after a surge in the number of graduate students attending the University from overseas, as well as directives from both American and Indian leaders for colleges and universities in each country to deepen their connections.
Adam Grotsky, executive director of the New Delhi-based United States-India Educational Foundation, said “these are exciting times to engage with India.”
“[India’s] universities and institutes of higher education have attained global recognition as a result of their significant contribution in research and development,” Grotsky said, calling India “a major knowledge-based economic power.”
The University has typically relied on pre-existing ties to countries they’ve eyed for expansion. For example, GW School of Business Dean Doug Guthrie, a China scholar, has helped lead development of a graduate degree program there. GW’s large South Korean alumni base has also given it opportunities to grow more in that country, Scarboro said.
Less than four months ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and India’s education minister Kapil Sibal met for the U.S.-India Higher Education Dialogue in Washington to explore avenues for the countries’ universities to work in tandem.
But the Indian government announced in August that it would narrow opportunities for partnerships with Indian schools, allowing only schools in the top 500 of the global rankings to add exchange programs in the country.
Deepa Ollapally, associate director of the Sigur Center for Asian Studies at the Elliott School of International Affairs, said the University should prepare for challenges like competition from other U.S. schools and India’s bureaucratic government, which she called “the biggest obstacle.”
“Its not easy to set up real partnerships with Indian institutions,” Ollapally said. “This also has to do with long-standing mindsets against foreign involvement that continue in the academy and bureaucracy.”

The academic centers that strengthen international students’ English skills are skyrocketing in popularity as the number of foreigners at GW climbs.
The heightened demand for the University’s Language Center and the Writing Center – which work with students to improve English writing skills – has both centers pining for more resources to add staff, summer sessions and programming.
Forty-five percent more undergraduates this fall are taking the Language Center’s English skills courses, which teach students how to write papers and give class presentations. International students who score below a specific benchmark on the Test of English as a Foreign Language, or TOEFL, must enroll in an additional English skills course in their first semester.
About 330 graduate students are in Language Center courses this fall, two-thirds more than last year.
Overall enrollment in English for Academic Purposes courses quadrupled over the past four years, with two new courses for graduate students in English-strengthening classes added in the past two years.
Director of the Language Center Shoko Hamano said even for the small number of EAP students who have studied in the U.S. before, some “still find the task of completing academic writing assignments challenging.”
She added that the program gives students the chance to acclimate to an American classroom in which “your professor is sensitive to the challenges of writing in a second language.”
GW’s more than 2,500 international students hail from 130 countries, with 40 percent of students coming from China and South Korea. These students must then overcome language barriers while learning Western academic styles. The University will officially tally its international student enrollment for the 2012-2013 academic year later this month.
The demand will likely continue climbing, Columbian College of Arts and Sciences Dean Peg Barratt said, as the University prioritizes globalization and foreign recruitment to help campus diversity and improve GW’s international stature. Nearly all undergraduate international students pay full tuition.
About 10 percent of GW students are international, but administrators have suggested they are seeking even higher foreign enrollment rates, comparable to Boston University’s foreign student rate of 16 percent.
The University saw a 40 percent surge in foreign graduate students this year – the fourth year enrollment had jumped.
Barratt said administrators are planning to add more English skills course sections this year to keep class sizes down, adding that she also hopes to add summer courses to help students prepare for the fall.
“That increase in international admission has definite implications for us,” she said.
Charles Mueller, an assistant professor who teaches English skills courses, said the department, housed in the Academic Center, is constantly hiring part-time professors to teach the additional class sections. He added that grading the English placement test that GW requires international students is now a massive task.
“That process is a lot more complex when you’re dealing with 400 students instead of 50. It makes a big difference,” Mueller said.
But the courses do not fully equip students to handle classes like University Writing, sophomore Wonman Hong, who took an English language course after coming to GW from South Korea last year, said.
Wong said while he thought it was “a good program to understand culture of Washington D.C. and U.S. college writing style,” he still fell behind in his University Writing class, because the English skills course didn’t emphasize paper citations and grouped together students with a wide array of English skills.
He added that because half of his English skills classmates were from China and the other half from South Korea, they only spoke to each other in their native languages.
“GW is providing everything, but [students] are not using it,” the international affairs major said.
The number of foreign students also affects the Writing Center, which provides free tutoring on academic writing for undergraduate and graduate students. Christy Zink, the Writing Center’s director, said 43 percent of students who got help last year did not speak English as their first language.
The Writing Center scheduled 5,200 appointments last year overall, a 16 percent jump from the year before, partly bolstered by foreign student sessions. The heavy traffic also prompted the Writing Center to hire seven more tutors than it had during the previous two years.
When training the student tutors who work at the Writing Center in Gelman Library, Zink said she integrates lessons more and more on how to teach international students techniques like how to use the articles “a,” “an” and “the.”
Junior Michelle Cho, in her second year as a Writing Center tutor, said international students make up about half her workload and many have not picked up grammar skills in their classes.
“They use the writing center like a grammar fix-it work shop,” she said.
Zink added that the perspectives of international students help strengthen the campus and the Writing Center.
“Our own sense of what English and academic writing can do is both deepened and heightened as we work with students across language experiences to help them become better writers,” Zink said.
She added that while the Writing Center and Language Center serve similar functions for international students, she is in close talks with Language Center director Shoko Hamano about what resources they need to add for international students. For example, they could add a practical and cultural component like how to take money out of an American bank, she said.
“What are the questions we need to ask about those balances [of international students] and how do we figure out how are we meeting student demands and what are the resources we want to lobby for internally,” she said. “We need to have a very close ear to the ground for the students.”

A record-breaking 2,800 alumni returned to Foggy Bottom this weekend – a turnout that far surpasses last year’s as the University looks to build a strong alumni core to bolster philanthropy.
The seventh annual program included 70 events across Foggy Bottom, allowing the University to connect former students with the campus and show off its growth. This year’s total attendance of 3,600 alumni, students and staff, represents a 37 percent increase from the year before and an 800 percent increase from the first Alumni Weekend in 2005, when 400 people showed up.
Vice President of Development and Alumni Relations Mike Morsberger said his office is also trying to better reach out to GW’s 250,000 alumni by sending more mail and creating higher quality newsletters and magazines. The office has also brought alumni back to campus to mentor students and learn more about the University before the launch of its 10-year strategic plan.
“People give because we have cranes up, because the selectivity of our students are better, because our faculty are better and these buildings are coming up out of the ground,” Morsberger said.
Out of the $120 million GW raised in fiscal year 2012, about $31 million in gifts came from alumni. That 9.3 percent alumni giving rate has remained steady in recent years.
The expansion of Alumni Weekend also represents an overall growth in alumni programming, Associate Vice President for Alumni Relations and Development Adrienne Rulnick said. Her office coordinated 400 events internationally last year, up from 200 when she started at GW five years ago.
Suzanne Grega, a 2002 graduate who chartered the Philadelphia chapter of the Alumni Association, came to Alumni Weekend for the first time this year. She said she has seen the level of communication with alumni rise in recent years.
“When I first graduated, I didn’t get much of anything from GW asking me to donate,” she said. “They want us to know what they have going on with the building and how they’re trying to make this a learning institution.”
The development office is working on an online system to track alumni engagement and tailor donation recommendations. The system would note each individual’s interests based on records of their event attendance, donation history and student organization affiliations.
“We can start to look at patterns. People who came twice, people who came three times, people in a leadership role – then look at their giving. We’re getting close to that, and that’s really our goal,” Rulnick said.
Morsberger said his office is always looking for ways to create “a more robust Alumni Weekend” to reconnect former Colonials with GW.
This year’s Earth, Wind & Fire concert cost the University $190,000, according to a contract obtained by The Hatchet. But the act attracted a crowd of 2,300, compared to the 600 people who attended last year’s Chuck Brown show and the more than 1,000 who came to see the Barenaked Ladies two years ago.
Taste of GW, a food festival featuring alumni and parents, tripled in size this year to include 18 vendors. Alumni sampled food from restaurants owned by other alumni or parents at makeshift mobile eateries that lined University Yard.
As fundraising and programming efforts intensify, the 200-person Division of Development and Alumni Relations office plans to increase staffing by about 10 percent over the next few years.
The University is also in the quiet phase of a multi-year comprehensive capital campaign, gauging interest from potential donors to determine a fundraising goal and timeline. It is expected to launch in 2014.
Since Morsberger arrived at GW two years ago, the development office has spread its reach across departments, schools and programs.
Alumni relationships are a key part of the University’s new career services strategy, announced last spring. The GW Career Center will pair up alumni with students for mentorships and specifically designate staff to network with alumni who could hire graduates.
The career staff is also working with the Office of Alumni Relations to include more opportunities for alumni to job hunt and train.
“We’re leveraging our activities and engagement to get people connected you have to start that way. You don’t start with giving,” Rulnick said.
For Gideon Davis, who has stayed in touch with GW by attending events every year since he graduated from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in 1996, engagement with the University has helped him shore up his career training.
“I looked at the economy. Jobs are shaky, so I thought it was better to go to the career management session they offered,” Davis said.
This fall, Rulnick coordinated GW’s first virtual career networking hour – a chatroom divided by industries like media and communications, art and business and economics that created six-minute “speed dating” for participants.
Rulnick worked with local universities this summer to create a D.C. alumni group in Asia. She will be traveling to Hong Kong this fall to help kick off the organization, which she said she hopes will connect students based on their D.C. experiences.
The development and alumni office has also encouraged professors and deans to reach out to alumni when they travel internationally.
Rulnick said she tells them, ” ‘I see you’re going to be in South Africa, we have 10 alumni in the city you’re going to be at, but if you have a free night, we’d love to have them come to dinner with you and ask them for their business cards.’ ”
“So we can maximize our efforts without always putting staff on a plane,” Rulnick said.

After a series of games in which the Colonials couldn’t click on offense, they turned up the heat Saturday, sending a total of 12 shots toward the Longwood net. But despite that renewed offensive front – which head coach Craig Jones called a clear improvement compared to games past – GW couldn’t outscore the Lancers, dropping 3-1 in its afternoon match.
“I’m disappointed that we lost,” Jones said. “But the positive obviously to come out of the game is we certainly took a lot more shots. We created more chances. So on that end – the offensive side – the only thing we didn’t do is score more goals.”
The Colonials netted the first goal of the game 29 minutes into play, taking its sole lead of the game when senior forward Seth Rudolph zipped the ball into the lower left corner of the net on a penalty kick. From there, both teams battled to put the second tally of the game on the board, but it was Longwood that scored less than 10 minutes after Rudolph’s goal, ending the first half in a 1-1 tie.
Early in the second half, the Colonials had several scoring opportunities, but their efforts were blocked by the Longwood goalkeeper. Further frustrating GW’s attack, the Lancers scored a second goal in the 56th minute of play, raising the score to 2-1.
The Colonials took a number of shots, but struggled with control, seeing most sail high or wide of the net throughout the rest of the half. The Lancers scored the final goal of the game, in the 83rd minute, on a breakaway.
“It was a good effort and a good fight, but we’ve just got some little mistakes we need to clean up,” junior forward Tyler Ranalli said.
Complicating play for the Colonials is the number of players on the team’s roster who have nagging injuries, keeping them from performing to their full potential. Jones was careful not to tax his team too much between Wednesday’s match against NJIT and Saturday’s contest, he said, because he wanted his players to have maximum recovery time.
Jones said he tried to look for the positive in the team’s depleted roster, adding that it allows for fluidity among GW’s bench.
“Anytime you have injuries, you have to shuffle the pack a little bit,” Jones said. “Like I say to the guys, it gives players an opportunity to play. And it gives other players, that may not necessarily get the minutes, to come in and take advantage of that maybe, and stick a claim for a starting spot.”
Before the Colonials begin A-10 play, Jones said he plans to give his players two days off to rest and take care of any injuries. Tuesday, though, they will begin to prepare for their first league game Friday evening at Richmond.
Jones said it is unfortunate the team will not begin conference play at home, but he is confident and recognizes that it is imperative that the Colonials are successful on the road.
In conference play, the team is not looking to make any major changes, Rudolph said, instead working to build off of the positive things they have done so far this season and to correct the mistakes they have been making. Ranalli said the Colonials are still looking to prove that they are the best team in the A-10. The team’s major goal, he said, is to make it to the championship, and next week marks the beginning of that path.
“It’s a whole new season next week,” Ranalli said.

The city has pushed back roadwork on New Hampshire Avenue to avoid disrupting University construction.
Following talks with the University, District Department of Transportation officials decided to wait until 2014 to move forward with a project for 24th Street and Washington Circle, which would have interfered with construction on the School of Public Health and Health Services, also on 24th Street.
The 18-month, $10.5 million New Hampshire Avenue project began last month, and will span from H Street to Dupont Circle and up New Hampshire Avenue. It would have stretched down to Washington Circle and the SPHHS site by the end of the year.
Monica Hernandez, a spokeswoman for DDOT, said eliminating the overlap in construction work would help to minimize impact on the University’s work and traffic concerns.
“At this time, we are planning to wait for GW’s contractor to complete work on the west side of the street in the public right-of-way before we address street improvements in our project,” Hernandez said.
DDOT was unaware of the GW construction until officials from the agency attended a neighborhood meeting in August. University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said the public health school’s project team later met with DDOT officials to “share the status of GW’s ongoing work and also discuss any implications that might arise from both projects occurring at the same time.”
DDOT agreed to postpone its work in the area that might interfere with GW’s construction following the discussions, she said.
Hernandez added that the work is now targeted to begin in spring or summer 2014 – almost a year and a half after expected.
Construction on the $75 million public health building began in May. It is expected to complete in 2014 and will centralize the school’s seven departments under one roof.
Project coordinators will also ensure the GW Hospital’s emergency vehicle exit is not impacted by the construction, Hernandez said. She added that one traffic lane and one sidewalk would remain open “at all times.”
Eric Stokes, associate administrator for the GW Hospital, said the hospital coordinated with DDOT to maintain full use of DC EMS vehicles.
“We have been assured by DDOT officials that their work will impact one lane at a time and have little impact on the hospital’s emergency exit,” he said.

The Colonials hoped their opening weekend of A-10 play would mirror their decisive victory over District-rival Howard the week before, a shutout win that seemed to give GW valuable momentum heading into league competition.
Instead, it was the exact opposite: back-to-back shutouts, this time with the Colonials on the losing end. They dropped 2-0 games to both Richmond, Friday, and conference newcomer VCU Sunday. And in both, head coach Sarah Barnes said, the key piece lacking from the team’s play was its offensive rhythm.
“At the end of the day, the bottom line for us is we have to do a better job at connecting passes so we can be more dangerous in attack,” Barnes said. “We’ve got to be able to keep the ball better.”
As Richmond fired shots to open play Friday, GW stayed solid on defense, led by freshman goalkeeper Shannon Murphy, who nabbed an early save after a Spiders corner kick. The Colonials battled with Richmond for the
first 45 minutes of play, but the half ended without either team finding the back of the net. They headed into the break scoreless.
But Richmond broke the deadlock early in the second, scoring with a header off of a free kick. In response, the Colonials’ aggressive nature increased, but they couldn’t get their shots to stay accurate. And in the 68th minute, the Spiders solidified their win with a shot fired 35 yards away from the net that would prove to be the final score of the game.
Freshman midfielder Kristi Abbate, who played significant minutes the entire weekend, said the momentum changed once the first goal was scored, but the Colonials never quit on the field.
“Our work ethic is really strong. We never gave up. I don’t even think ’til the last minute we stopped trying. People were still slide tackling,” Abbate said.
The Colonials returned to the pitch Sunday, seeking to secure their first A-10 win in a contest against VCU. But the Rams netted a goal off of a corner kick at the 11th minute of play in the first, forcing GW to play catch-up for the rest of the game.
The Colonials ended the half with only three shot attempts, seeking to establish the offensive rhythm emphasized in conversations leading up to the game.
“We really wanted to attack hard and make sure we had good pressure on the ball. We had high confidence going into this game,” Murphy said.
The Rams entered the second half with a bang, tallying two shot attempts quickly within the first five minutes of play. With 21 minutes left in the game, junior Alex Neal crossed the ball towards senior Adriana Moya, seeking to put the Colonials on the board, but a Rams defender dove in front of the pass, halting its path. VCU’s score in the 82nd minute of play sealed its victory, marking the second straight shutout loss for GW.
But Barnes emphasized the need to take the season game-by-game, a caution against hitting the panic button after a disappointing opening to A-10 play.
“I think this is a process. There are little things we do better each game,” Barnes said. “We just need to be more consistent overall.”

GW’s victory over Saint Louis Saturday was the sort of hard-fought win that could have the power to change the tone of a season.
After a straight set loss Friday at the hands of A-10 newcomer Butler, the Colonials were threatened with a winless weekend. But the team was determined to have the last say. Down two sets in Saturday’s match against Saint Louis, GW came storming back to win the next three and take the match 3-2.
“I just couldn’t be more proud of this team,” head coach Amanda Ault said. “It shows a lot about them, and today they really showed themselves that we can do this. Hopefully they gained some confidence after tonight.”
In Friday’s matchup against Butler, the Colonials were never able to grab the momentum. They struggled, losing the first set 25-16 largely due to nine attack errors and a subpar .026 attack percentage. The second set was likely GW’s best chance to get back in the match, but after 12 ties and five lead changes, a 3-1 Butler run allowed the Bulldogs to sneak out a 25-22 win.
Slow starts have plagued GW all season, which Ault attributes to poor ball handling and a lack of aggressiveness.
“We just couldn’t ever get anything going,” Ault said. “We talk a lot about the serve-and-pass game, and that’s where our matches are either won or loss. But right from the beginning, we weren’t going aggressive at the line or taking care of that first contact.”
The Colonials fought hard in the third set to make up for their early mistakes, using a 13-7 run to tie the match late at 23-23. The deficit proved too large though, as Butler was able to win three of the last four points and clinch the set 26-24. Junior Jamie Armstrong and senior Lauren Whyte both had double-digit kills – 10 and 11 respectively – while freshman Maddy Doyle kept the defense strong with a career-high 20 digs.
“We know with the additions of VCU and Butler that there are two very good teams being added to the A-10, so we were expecting a good match,” Ault said. “They’re just a really good team who did a lot of things well against us.”
Early on, Saturday’s match against Saint Louis looked eerily similar to the Butler loss the day before. GW started slow, hitting -.186 in the first set and -.024 in the second set, practically handing the Billikens their 25-12 and 25-15 set wins. In the third set though, something changed for GW. The Colonials opened up the frame with a 9-3 lead and extended that to 19-11 advantage.  They held off a late scare from Saint Louis and secure the set 26-24.
“It was like it was a different team,” Ault said. “They started to execute the game plan, they started to take care of the ball more and they started to put each other in better situations. That momentum and that energy makes you feed off of each other instead of bringing you down like in the first two sets.”
GW was able to take the fourth set 25-20 and force a deciding fifth set. For a moment, it appeared that the Colonials’ comeback would be all for naught as the Billikens grabbed an early 7-3 lead in the fifth. But once again, GW stole the momentum, using a 6-1 run to take a 9-8 lead, before relying on two consecutive kills from sophomore Landon Garvik to finish off the set 15-12.
“Whenever you fight back from being down 0-2, it speaks a lot about your team,” Ault said. “Especially the way that we were down, because really, we just got stomped in the first couple of games. So to really change their attitude, change their mind-set, change their aggressiveness overall as a team was huge.”
The comeback would not have been possible if not for the performances of Whyte, sophomore Kelsey Newman and redshirt freshman Jessica Lubic. Whyte led all players with 18 kills, while Newman put away 14 kills of her own and posted career-highs of 18 digs and six blocks for a match-high 19.5 points. Lubic paced the team throughout the entire match, putting up 39 assists and 15 digs.
“They [Whyte and Newman] both stepped up, especially in game three, and started attacking the way we needed them to,” Ault said. “They were hitting their shots, going up strong and giving us energy to feed off of.”
The grinding win brings the Colonials’ A-10 record to an even .500. The team will play its next three conference matches at home, hopefully giving the Colonials the opportunity to climb the ladder in the A-10 standings.
