The University went public this week with news that cyclist and philanthropist Lance Armstrong will be the new dean of admissions, months after GW admitted to inflating admissions data for more than 10 years, resulting in expulsion from U.S. News & World report’s collegiate rankings.
Armstrong addressed the Board of Trustees Sunday, wearing his trademark yellow jersey and teardrop-shaped helmet.
“Listen, if GW’s going to get to the front of the pack and stay there, we’re going to need an edge,” Armstrong told the group of admiring onlookers. “I plan to enhance this university’s reputation in any way I can.”
Babysitter #3 told Le Hachét in January that the shortlist for the job also included German pop duo Milli Vanilli, “A Million Little Pieces” author James Frey, famed Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and Richard Nixon’s corpse.
When asked to release the audit report revealing details regarding the admissions office’s actions, University President Power Napp told Le Hachét to “blow it out your collective ass.”
Still, he expressed enthusiasm for the hire, calling Armstrong a “role model” for all GW administrators to follow, adding that “he really has the ball for this job.”
“Cat Napper did an excellent job throughout her 35-year tenure, but we felt she came up short toward the end,” Klapp said. “In Lance Armstrong, I believe we have hired a world-class liar. He can come in and immediately pick up where she left off.”
Armstrong’s first week in office has been busy, as he has already tapped seven-time National League MVP Barry Bonds as his second-in-command. Bonds said the two plan to hit the ground running.
“The first thing I told Lance to do was change the office’s name,” Bonds said. “Napper ran an admissions office. This is going to be just the opposite. No admissions. We’re not going to admit to shit – not even under oath.”

Tired of students texting and whispering class, renowned chef Jose Andres flung an entire pot of scalding bisque onto the first three rows in his much-hyped food science course last week.
The 43-year-old, who originally hails from Spain, said if he expects no horseplay in his kitchen, then the same should go for his classroom.
“I don’t mess around with lazy students. My tapas are hot and so is my temper,” Andres said after the incident.
Dinah Orbistro, a freshman who came to GW in part because of Andres’ curricular offering, said she would relish her #onlyatGW moment despite the third-degree burns sustained to both her corneas.
“Who really needs to see anything when you can taste all of Chef Andres’ delicious courses,” she said. “Now, I can justify my tuition bill to my parents by saying I’m learning from a famous guy.”
Andres, known for his short fuse and high standards, reportedly has also lectured on the techniques of weed brownie baking and set off a swarm of bees in Jack Morton Auditorium as part of a honey-making demonstration, according to students in the semester-long lecture.
The University has stood behind Andres’ actions, with administrators and staffers saying the famous chef has been a public relations boon despite student injuries.
“We support Mr. Andres’ innovative teaching methods,” University spokeswoman Lotta Spin said. “We’ll continue to exploit his big name, don’t worry.”

The University announced Monday that it would cease recording transcripts and instead only give students oral reports of their academic progress.
Administrators concluded a recordless system is best after it tasked a firm to audit botched admissions data nearly six months ago, but received no formal written report of the investigation.
“If it worked then, it’ll work now,” University President Power Napp said. “What can a written report tell you that we can’t say to you?”
Shortly after administrators announced they screwed up the numbers, the college rankings gods at U.S. News & World Report tossed GW off their list.
Napp said students likely wouldn’t need to send formal reports of their academic reputations to outside schools or employers because “nobody expects that from an unranked institution anyway.”
He shot back against experts’ statements that called the lack of written reports unusual.
“We are holding ourselves to this standard across the University. From now on, nobody will write any plans down. In fact, our 10-year strategic plan will be an oral report,” Napp said. “That thing will cost us like $300 million. We’re bound to miss some stuff, and if you don’t write it down, it’s like it didn’t happen.”
Cutting all written reports will also reduce waste, a top goal in the University’s tree-hugging hippie plan.

As acceptance letters landed in Class of 2017 inboxes last week, administrators touted an upsurge in the number of hipsters who will make up the incoming freshman class.
In interviews with accepted students – who took spring campus tours sporting non-prescription glasses, checkered scarves and beer-stained Wavves T-shirts – most said they were drawn to GW’s newfound anonymity after it was kicked off the U.S. News & World Report’s top colleges list last fall.
“GW isn’t on any big rankings list. The problem with schools like the University of Texas or Texas A&M, as great as they are, is that you’ve heard of them,” Amaro Hudson, a prospective student from Austin, Texas, said.
Admissions officers said they could tell early on that this year’s freshman class would be different than past years. One staffer said he counted nine essays citing Banksy as an inspiration.
In about 28 “Why GW?” essays, students mentioned that they admired the University’s rebranding campaign, which they wrote was so poorly executed that it must have been self-deprecating and ironic.
University Director of Saving Face Melinda We’reScrewed said the unranking turned out to be a veritable blessing in disguise for the University.
“Initially, this unranking debacle was really disconcerting for the Office of Admissions and the student body as a whole,” We’reScrewed said. “But we never anticipated that we would actually see a rise in applications as a result. So now we’re like, whatever, let’s misreport the shit out of our admissions data if it means we can pull in this new demographic.”
But in interviews, some accepted students were beginning to regret their decision after learning more about GW. Several applicants audibly gagged when a reporter read the names of GW’s last decade of campus performers.
“Train was here? Fucking Train? Jesus,” applicant Fiona Wordplay said.
For rising freshman Sierra X-Pro II, frustrations with “sell-out” universities mounted when high school classmates donned apparel bearing recognizable university logos.
“If a school is represented in Victoria’s Secret’s PINK Collegiate Collection, it’s the kind of school I don’t want to attend,” X-Pro II said.
X-Pro II said she was excited to be a part of a university in its formative years of rebranding, admitting that she looks forward to the day “at least five, maybe six” years down the line when she can claim she went to GW before GW really became GW.
“Other universities report accurate admissions data and uphold academic integrity as paramount just for the sake of landing on those bullshit magazine lists. But GW swims against the stream, it doesn’t care about all that,” X-Pro II said. “And that’s what makes it great.”

The Supreme Court issued a surprisingly early decision on the country’s same-sex marriage bans Monday, pointing to the flood of red equals signs that filled their Facebook feeds last week in a sweeping gay marriage victory.
“We were just so moved by the outpouring of student support for their gay BFFs,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a unanimous decision. “These students have mastered the art of activism.”
Associate Justice Clarence Thomas was not initially convinced by the steady stream of red equal signs, but said he was convinced to join the majority after noticing links on people’s news feeds to Macklemore’s “Same Love,” a song Thomas cites as one of his new favorites.
“At first I saw no room in the Constitution for same-sex marriage, even with these new profile pictures,” Thomas said. “But once the ‘Same Love’ links came flowing in, I realized that this was about the heart.”
Antonin Scalia, who had previously compared homosexuality to beastiality, said his view of gay marriage has also shifted because of social media. After clicking through 27 BuzzFeed cat meme pages, he announced at the justices’ press conference that he would soon wed his 6-year-old calico cat Tigger.
“I’ve realized that Tigger and I are meant to be together. The definition of marriage needs to bend,” he said.
The move ignited mass celebrations across campus Sunday, with students bursting with pride in the role they played in the historic ruling. Some said they planned to celebrate by Instagramming selfies of them and their friends making air hearts together with captions like “love is love.”
Leading student activists said they thought their late-night strategy sessions to sway the relatively conservative justices paid off.
“We thought the cheeky, clever posters we were planning to carry on the Supreme Court steps would do the trick, but we decided to promote the profile picture switches at the last minute,” Allied in Wine leader Ray N-Bow said. “That appeared to be the deciding factor.”

GW has strived to become a green-friendly campus for the past several years. And University President Power Napp has demonstrated his own eco-consciousness from Day One. Our editorial board considers this a noble goal. But we don’t think the University has taken this initiative far enough.
If the University really wants to become a leader in sustainability, all toilets must go.
Each time students flush a toilet, they use 1.5 to two gallons of water, according to a Yahoo! Answers responder. Frankly, that’s excessive. Imagine all the water we could save if we all just stopped using the toilet altogether.
If the University flushes toilets away, it will encourage students to be more conscious of their water usage, and not nearly as much will go to waste. Such a bold and innovative approach will certainly launch the University to the top of the list of the Most Eco-Friendly Colleges in the country.
Green GW has backed the move, fundraising nearly $1,700 to remove existing plumbing from residence halls.
This new initiative might raise some concerns among particularly hard-assed administrators. Some have questioned how students will relieve themselves. The answer is simple: Move off campus into apartments or homes that still have bathrooms.
Many students already live off campus, but for those who choose to stay in the residence halls, well, they should find a friend with a bathroom, because GW won’t foot the water bill anymore.
And if that fails, you could always just urinate in the Kogan Plaza fountain.
But to quell any anxieties, administrators should know that students on the whole welcome this structural change to residence halls.
Becky Goldenweiner, president of the Ermey High School Ecology Club and a newly accepted member of the Class of 2017, said the cost is “totally worth it to be a part of a university that truly cares about the sustainability of like, our planet.”
Seth Weinershell, director of GW Shacks, said the cost for removing toilets from all halls will be minimal – a simple $10,000 addition to each room’s cost for the Class of 2017 will cover it. And given GW’s already high cost of attendance and living expenses, what’s a few thousand more dollars?
“I would literally do ANYTHING to become the most sustainable school in the world. And if that means students have to give up their potty privileges, well then, so be it,” Napp said.
We appreciate Napp’s passion for sustainability and his dedication to making GW more efficient when it comes to water usage, and we call for the Board of Trustees to put an end to this water usage pronto.

At a stirring pep rally in front of a packed Duques classroom, athletic director Pounda Beer-o announced his newest initiative to raise school spirit: The men’s basketball team will remain unranked in solidarity with the rest of the University.
The move will help the rest of the student body feel closer to its men’s basketball team in the wake of U.S. News & World Report kicking GW off its annual rankings in November, he added.
“We really need our students to continue to feel connected to our athletes. Because they’re students too. They were unranked too,” Beer-o said. “And now they’re doubly unranked.”
A banner commemorating the basketball team’s desire to remain unranked will soon hang on the Smith Center walls, complementing a recent $10 million renovation.
It would be the first banner added to the Smith Center rafters in six years, he pointed out, a sign of the Colonials’ desire to reach new heights.
“I mean, we’re quite literally reaching new heights with this banner,” Beer-o said. “No, seriously. We’re probably going to have a couple of the guys get on each others’ shoulders to put it up there.”
Head coach Mike Lookstowin stood by Beer-o’s side for the presentation.
Lookstowin stepped in front of the crowd, praising his team’s decision to support the University community and outlining the Colonials’ other accomplishments this season.
“It was, yeah, quite a year. We went to Brooklyn, I mean, it was basically a 24-hour bus trip, but we were physically there,” Lookstowin said.
Boosted by the new desire to remain unranked, Lookstowin promised an exciting 2013-14 campaign for the men’s basketball team.
To ensure they reach that goal, The Colonials are taking serious off-season strides, like discouraging recruits from actually attending the University, the head coach said.
“And, you know, starting some young guys really clicked for us this year,” Lookstowin pointed out. “So next year, I think you’ll see some high school freshmen play some starter’s minutes, definitely. If not middle schoolers.”
The men’s basketball team’s new goal comes at an important time – when GW is seeking to determine the true meaning of its newly-coined catchphrase, Beer-o said. The solidarity shown in unranking, Beer-o said, goes a long way in defining “Raise High.”
“We’ve talked a lot this year about, you know, what does “Raise High” mean to us? And clearly, it doesn’t mean to climb to a higher slot in the U.S. News & World Report rankings,” Beer-o said.

A University administrator broke from his leash and conducted an interview Sunday without a media relations babysitter, marking the first time a GW official independently and candidly responded to questions with coherent thoughts and full sentences.
“I called my mom afterward. She was so proud that I talked without my babysitter,” Deputy Senior Associate Vice Secretary of I-Don’t-Really-Do-Anything Bobby McBumbles said.
In an interview with Le Hachét, McBumbles actually answered questions – rather than reading answers off a piece of paper for every question – and did not resort to baby talk. The move was a break from the totalitarian decree that mandates babysitters escort administrators and ensure communication conforms with the Propaganda Task Force.
“I was a little nervous because the last time we let an administrator go to an interview alone, he actually released numbers. We can’t just have our top administrators participating in a constructive dialogue. I mean, I went to babysitting school to prevent chaos and anarchy,” Babysitter #1 said.
Babysitter #1 said she let McBumbles loose because he ate all his vegetables Saturday night without any temper tantrums. She added that she let him go to the interview alone, as long as he promised to look both ways before crossing the street on the way to his Rice Hall office.
He came to the interview right after nap time, and only had to pause during the interview once to fill his sippy cup with juice.
“I hope they let me off my leash again soon. I was just potty trained, for Pete’s sake, I’m a big boy now,” McBumbles said.

The University will ban sex within 25 feet of all campus buildings next fall, forcing fornication into the middle of the street.
The policy change – which encompasses all sexual activity – comes on the heels of the decision to implement a smoking ban on campus, which will officially begin next fall. Sex, like smoking, is already banned in all University buildings, although Senior Associate Hashtagger Tweeter Konwersky said he knows students still do it anyway.
Students found pounding each other in residence halls, academic buildings, GelHell and on sidewalks will be reported to Student Jail. University officials said they aren’t worried about students sneaking into student space hotspots to have sex since there isn’t any student space in the first place.
And although dozens of students have said they’re concerned that the spaces where they are allowed to fuck are dangerous, Konwersky said not to worry.
“They just need to let their guard down and be creative,” Konwersky said. “The middle of the road is an excellent place to get it on. It’s dangerous. If you’re a wuss, consider hoods of parked cars. Just please, everyone, stay away from 23rd Street – you’ll die.”
Dozens of students surveyed by Le Hachét said they were already trying out having sex in the street in preparation for next year’s policy change, experimenting with comfortable positions on gravel and practicing maneuvering through Segway tours.
Junior Lenda Handy said she doesn’t mind GW infringing on her personal right to sex, noting that she even gets turned on by University Gestapo watching her.
“Sometimes when I’m with some guy and I see one of the officers looking at me, I think it’s kinda hot,” Handy said. “One time, I even asked him to join, and he was totally up for it.”

Zoning officials this week deemed GW’s massive science and engineering building structurally unsound, and construction workers are blaming the University for refusing to print a blueprint.
The city’s chief building inspector found multiple defects in the Science and Engineering Hall after it was completed last week, including a shaky foundation that indicated an imminent collapse.
The company leading the project, Klark Konstruction, said crews could not recall details – including where to lay the walls and how many stories to build – because University officials banned workers from writing down specific parts of the plan.
GW has followed a pattern of failing to write reports and plans since the school admitted it flubbed admissions data in November and hired a firm to conduct an audit. But that audit was never written down and administrators only received an oral report from investigators.
Administrators, including GW’s top development officer Ah GiveMeANight, gave an oral report of the building’s plans at a closed-down zoning meeting in fall 2010. Multiple city and GW officials said the University did not present written documentation of any kind.
“I’m pretty sure the final building is entirely different than what GW originally proposed,” Bob Builder said.
When asked why the blueprints were never put into writing, Babysitter #1 said, “We are ignoring your request. Please do not expect an answer before your deadline.”
The $275 million building, meant to boost the University’s research profile, is GW’s most expensive and pointless to date.
University President Power Napp said last month that he doesn’t think the “super shiny” building will improve the quality of GW’s science and engineering students. But multiple administrators, including Napp, said it would make a “stellar new stop” on the prospective student tour route.
Junior Skippy Magoo said he was extremely frustrated to hear the project’s construction had been halted, and would be demanding answers.
The political science major said he didn’t care about taking classes in the building, but cited the severe personal stress he endured from the twice-daily blastings near his dorm room.
“What the hell were they blowing up if they didn’t know what they were doing?!” Magoo said.
In addition to causing early-morning earthquakes, the project also hiked up tuition and caused bickering among the handful of science-related departments at GW.
More than a dozen faculty members declined to comment for this story because they’re too busy not doing research to answer phone calls or emails.
