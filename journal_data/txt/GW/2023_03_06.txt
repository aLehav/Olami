Forward Augustus Burkhardt's career in the junior league is highlighted by eight goals, 20 assists and a total of 34 points in 35 games with the East Coast Wizards in the 2018-19 season while totaling five goals, 16 assists and 21 points in the 2017-18 season with the New Jersey Rockets.
After playing two years in the junior hockey league with the East Coast Wizards and reclassifying at his boarding school to play an additional year, then 21-year-old forward Augustus Burkhardt came to GW in 2019, shifting his focus from hockey to academics after a handful of concussions.
Now as he hangs up his skates after four years of club hockey, the Atlantic Coast Collegiate Hockey League named Burkhardt the Elite Division II Player of the Year Feb. 16 after he recorded 26 goals, 21 assists and 47 points in his senior season. And when he’s not knocking in hattricks to guide the team to the division playoffs, Burkhardt juggles the team’s logistics and finances as the president of GW Club Hockey.
Junior hockey is a professional hockey league for players ages 16 to 20 and is generally considered “amateur hockey,” but traditionally, players play in the junior hockey leagues before attending college to gain more experience and skill. During his time playing junior hockey, Burkhardt said he would train from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and would work part time afterward for two years.
He said junior hockey helped him develop his skills as a hockey player to prepare him for NCAA hockey at the DI or DIII level, but at the end of his term with the East Coast Wizards, a handful of concussions led him and his family to shift focus to academics. He said his time playing in the junior leagues allowed him to excel in club hockey since he was able to take the competitiveness of NCAA DI- and DIII-like hockey games into club hockey.
Burkhardt’s career in the junior league is highlighted by eight goals, 20 assists and a total of 34 points in 35 games with the East Coast Wizards in the 2018-19 season while totaling five goals, 16 assists and 21 points in the 2017-18 season with the New Jersey Rockets.
“I guess a more personal aspect that I feel I brought to the team, I guess by nature of it, because I was older from the get-go, I guess some maturity,” Burkhardt said. “I was very fortunate to have played hockey at a somewhat high level before. I was able to help the team, especially in places where the schedule was tougher, I was able to perform well.”
The hockey team assembled a 10-10-1 conference record in the American Collegiate Association Division II, where 200 teams play across the U.S. but recorded a 3-6 record in the regional Atlantic Coast Collegiate Hockey League, ranking fourth in the Capitol Region but did not qualify for the ACCHL playoffs. In the 2021-22 season, the team recorded a 7-3 record with a second-place rank in the Capitol Division and the eighth seed in the ACCHL quarterfinals, where they played until the quarterfinals.
The 14 head coaches that make up the Elite Division select the Player of the Year award as part of the annual ballot of season awards, including First Team, Second Team and Rookie of the Year. The ACCHL is split into two levels – the Premier League comprises bigger schools with varsity teams that compete for regionals and national tournaments, while the Elite Division 14 teams vie for a more localized conference title.
Burkhardt recorded a total of 68 goals, 51 assists and 119 goals in 58 games throughout his career after missing out on the 2020-21 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Burkhardt attributes his success to the coaching staff, made up of alumni and assistant coach David Baratta and Head Coach Jon Moynihan, that welcomed him with open arms in 2019 and helped him adjust to college life in an environment where he felt comfortable with both teammates and coaches due to the less intense atmosphere.
He said receiving the Player of the Year nod from the ACCHL felt “incredible” since only a small number of players are recognized by the league and showcased other teams’ acknowledgment of his performance.
“So I’m extremely grateful for them,” Burkhardt said. “And both the coaches and the kids that I’ve been able to play with for the last four years, because that really made the environment what it was, and definitely helps me perform well, both on and off the ice.”
Baratta said when Burkhardt reached out to the coaches in his freshman year to play with the club team, they knew he would be one of their top players due to his experience in the juniors. He said Burkhardt gives other coaches “nightmares”  as a consistent scoring threat.
Baratta said Burkhardt took the initiative to keep in touch with all the team’s players and contact interested freshmen during the pandemic to maintain the team’s numbers and chemistry until they could get back on the ice. During the pandemic, the team were off the ice up until the fall of 2021 due to the safety distancing guidelines placed by the league and GW.
“Off the ice, the constant refrain we heard from other coaches when it came to Augie and why I think he probably won this award, is they had nothing but nice things to say about him off the ice,” Baratta said. “He got to know several of the other coaches in the league from playing against them and in the handshake line, they always said he would look them in the eye and thank them for a good game.”
Sophomore and assistant captain defenseman Cade Llewellyn said Burkhardt acts as the glue of the team, ensuring all club members socialize with each other and have fun in the locker room before games to build chemistry.
Llewellyn was named to the All-ACCHL 2nd-Team after recording 11 assists, three goals and 14 points this season and said he has a big role to fill as the incoming captain since Burkhardt graduates in the spring. He said during the pandemic, Burkhardt kept the program alive by keeping up with the demands and needs of GW to maintain its club status.
“He is an old man,” Llewellyn said. “So we would like to give him a lot of cr*p for that, without a doubt, he is our father.”
Llewelyn said Burkhardt makes up for “95 percent” of the team offense scoring in every match multiple goals whenever he’s passed to puck, performing hat tricks and quick offensive plays for the team at a minute’s notice.
He said the team appreciates Burkhardt’s dedication to the program during the pandemic and regrets often taking Burkhardt for granted. He said players will remember Burkhardt as the heart and soul of the team.
“We’re going to miss him a lot,” Llewellyn said. “What he did to keep our program alive and keep it running as smoothly as it has for the last couple years is just a testament to how hard he works.”

Comedian, writer and filmmaker Negin Farsad said growing up as an Iranian American in Palm Springs, California, she felt isolated because there weren’t a lot of people with a similar ethnic background living nearby. 
A comedian and author talked about her life as an Iranian American woman and her work as a comic, discussing how she uses it to combat Islamophobia at the keynote speech for GW’s annual Diversity Summit Wednesday.
Comedian, writer and filmmaker Negin Farsad said modern American conceptions of ethnic identity are limiting, discussing how people can use comedy as a mechanism to “fight” racism and xenophobia. Jesse J. Holland, an assistant professor of media and public affairs, moderated the event at GW at the Jack Morton Auditorium in the School of Media and Public Affairs building.
Farsad hosts a political comedy podcast named “Fake the Nation,” wrote a book named “How to Make White People Laugh” in 2016 and gave a TED Talk in the same year titled “A highly scientific taxonomy of haters.”
Farsad spoke about being a “hyphenated American,” a label often referring to recently arrived ethnic groups in the United States, tying them to their point of origin, like the label of “Southeast-Asian American,” and how that affects the perception of one’s identity. She said applying labels to different groups can restrict peoples’ views of them, narrowing and stereotyping the imagery in a person’s head.
“Our ability to accept them and understand them is a little limited, right, because our labels are so rigid already,” Farsad said.
Farsad said growing up as an Iranian American in Palm Springs, California, she felt isolated because there weren’t a lot of people with a similar ethnic background living nearby. She said she “wanted” to be Mexican American because of locals’ familiarity with their culture versus her own.
“I pointed out there are so many Mexican Americans in Palm Springs and when I was growing up, I wanted to be Mexican because we moved from the sticks of Virginia,” Farsad said. “And it’s already hard enough to be a new kid at school. But I was the new kid at school named Negin who spoke English with a redneck Southern accent.”
Farsad said she got her master’s degree in African American studies from Columbia University in 2004 because she felt as part of an “underpopulated” ethnic background she felt like she could “glom” onto “the nearest largest minority group.”
“I know you might be wondering, why did you get a degree in African American studies?” Farsad said. “And the simple answer to that is it just sort of felt like the closest thing that made sense to me.”
Farsad said she worked on “The Muslims Are Coming!,” a 2013 movie that documented her experience traveling across the U.S. with a group of fellow comedians in an attempt to dispel misconceptions about Muslims. She said on one stop in Salt Lake City, Utah, she and some of the other people she traveled with stood in front of a Mormon temple with “hug a Muslim” signs and received a warm response.
When asked about how to advocate for oneself as a Muslim American, nonwhite woman, Farsad said she walks into situations acting like the people she is meeting “want me there.”
“I just have story after story of being treated terribly,” Farsad said. “And I think I was treated terribly because I walked in nervous that I was going to be treated terribly.”

Much like an ill-fitting face covering, compliance with GW’s classroom mask mandate was slipping well before the University ended the policy last Monday. But after three years of COVID-19, GW can finally breathe easy, or at the very least, maskless.
Though COVID is not over, the pandemic that infected GW’s community and culture with a cocktail of fear, uncertainty and doubt has come to an official close. GW was one of the last holdouts of the near-extinct mask mandate as the only “large,” “urban” campus in the U.S. with such a requirement still in place for its instructional settings. The departure of this once familiar “COVID culture” is also fading at the citywide level as D.C. prepares to close all of its eight COVID centers that provided D.C. residents with vaccines, boosters, testing and masks by March 31. The writing is on the wall – the “new normal” we have long waited for is officially upon us.
The end of the indoor mask mandate is the official close to this pandemic era of GW’s history. It is the last of the University’s major COVID restrictions to drop since students returned to a fully reopened GW in fall 2021. After experiencing GW from their own homes and or in a tightly regulated campus environment, students have joined an array of student organizations, made the most of D.C.’s nightlife scene and prepared for commencement on the National Mall since campus reawakened a year and a half ago.
Now, it feels like that effort to make the most of what GW and the District have to offer has gone into overdrive. Call it making up for lost time or not realizing what you have until it’s gone. Either way, students who have never known a pre-pandemic GW and those who still have distant memories of the 2019-20 academic year are following one simple idea – do something and do it now.
The end of the mask mandate was the finish line of a three-year-long marathon that tested each of us physically and mentally. While some mastered Blackboard, Webex and Zoom better than others, we tuned into class from childhood bedrooms, kitchen tables and impromptu offices. The year 2020 was an age of sourdough, sing-alongs and sorrow, a time when toilet paper ran low and emotions ran high.
When in-person learning resumed, every cough, sniffle and sneeze was an ill-omen – the virological equivalent of opening an umbrella indoors. Rain or shine, from dawn till dusk, we waited in line at the COVID testing trailer at H and 20th streets until swabbing our nostrils became ingrained in our collective muscle memory. Cases surged in September 2021, backed off, then spiked again before the week of final exams in December 2021, ensuring a virtual start to the spring 2022 semester.
We mourned the losses of those closest to us as 2021 came to a close. In a sea of white flags that grew so large it moved from the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium to the National Mall, we remembered those who died by the hundreds of thousands.
The University’s regulations waxed and waned along the way as we entered 2022, providing tantalizing glimpses of a post-pandemic GW – and dashing our hopes just as quickly. After briefly lifting the mask mandate in June 2021 and reimposing it the next month, officials did so again in April 2022 after only a week.
If past attempts are any sign, officials’ decision to drop the mandate last Monday may not be final. But both the state of COVID measures across the country and at universities has changed. GW’s community has a high COVID vaccination rate, and cases of COVID infection and hospitalization in the District have remained low for more than six months. So our attitude has changed, too. We are ready to move on. 
The scars this virus has left will always remain, but the overwhelming fear of catching COVID, uncertainty about the University’s response to the pandemic and doubt about GW’s ability to manage caseloads has faded. Just look where we are nearly three long years removed from the start of the pandemic – at the beginning of last school year, we were practically barred from being in each other’s residence hall rooms. Now, it’s hardly uncommon to have your friends over for a party.
Thanks to multiple rounds of vaccinations and boosters, this virus is no longer the difference between life and death for most. But that’s not the case for everyone, especially those who are immunocompromised. So whether you prefer to wear a mask for peace of mind, need to protect your health or choose not to wear one, we all can and should explore these opportunities to the extent that we’re comfortable.
The pandemic showed each of us just how fragile our world and the people in it are. From the professors who teach us to the staff who keep GW running day to day and our friends and family, few of us have escaped the last three years unscathed.
The mask mandate has already been gone for one week. And from every week hereafter, it will be up to each of us to navigate Foggy Bottom, D.C. and beyond in a world that is quickly moving past the pandemic. With a little courage, commitment and confidence, we can make the most of this new normal.

Cybersecurity dilemmas are the difference between a door and a wall, according to my research methods professor Kerric Harvey. Online privacy protections should act as a wall between hackers and the private data they seek to steal. But once someone turns that wall into a door, it’s impossible to keep track of the keys to your personal information.
While GW still holds the keys to our private data, every member of our community needs to know if our personal information is secure. History proves that we can’t take the University’s word for it.
While most students rarely read the University’s promotion-filled emails in-full, I woke up to a frightening one last month. Its subject line and sender both caught my attention – “Alert: GW Cybersecurity Incident” from privacy@gwu.edu. The email states “a malicious intruder” broke into GW’s directory and downloaded students’ information, but the hacker did not steal any data that was “sensitive” or “personal.”
The GW community received a fairly similar email from interim University President Mark Wrighton last February notifying them of a secret program that tracked their movement across campus in aggregate without their consent. Wrighton said that while “the technical capacity may exist to track individuals across our campus,” officials did not track individual people across our campus.
There’s clearly a pattern in how GW handles data privacy – trust us, whoever has your information hasn’t done anything bad with it. At least not yet. But that pitiful response to our data privacy concerns raises several questions. Can officials actually determine the damage these incidents cause? And how do we know that hackers can’t cover their tracks better than the University can chase them?
After hackers executed a ransomware attack at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University last April, they claimed to have stolen personal information like contracts and Social Security numbers. Much like GW reassures students of their data privacy, North Carolina A&T’s administrators said no students or faculty were affected in last April’s incident. Would we be so certain that our information is secure when – not if – GW is hacked?
There are two different data privacy issues facing every member of the GW community right now. The first deals with dangerous cyberattacks to which our campus continually falls victim. The second concerns GW’s reckless use of our data to advance its development projects. Both lead to one conclusion – the University isn’t responsible enough to handle our private information.

A total of 44 colleges and universities were attacked with ransomware in 2022, up from 26 campuses in 2021, according to Emsisoft, a company that works to decrypt ransomware and recover data lost in attacks.
Since May 2021, the GW community has suffered at least two ransomware attacks, one data breach and a credit-card hack on the University’s cap and gown vendor.
When a cyber attack struck GW Law’s academic database in December 2021, several students lost their completed final exams in the system’s crash. In the same week, hackers broke into Kronos, GW’s employee payment platform, and launched a ransomware attack compromising faculty and staff members’ GWIDs, Net IDs, campus addresses and other sensitive personal information.
The cyber attacks on GW Law School and Kronos each occurred while members of our campus community served as unwitting participants in a school-sponsored surveillance system. The University’s then-secret tracking program – ostensibly meant to assess population density across campus buildings – outraged students and faculty whose movement the program monitored throughout fall 2021.
Cybersecurity experts said news of the University’s extensive tracking capabilities actually made GW more vulnerable to ransomware attacks because it showed GW could access individualized data. And after officials touted a remodel of GW’s data privacy principles last fall, industry professionals were quick to point out that they were too brief, broad and outdated for students to feel safe. Before officials updated the University’s data privacy notice in January, experts noted “there’s certainly no details” in the outline of how they collect certain University data.
The University has renewed its public commitment to “safeguarding and maintaining the privacy of your personal information” with its updated data privacy notice. But has GW’s cybersecurity system become more of an open door than a brick wall? GW “deeply regrets” each of these top-down security failures, but the University’s credibility on data privacy has fallen through the floor. The data concerns of students, staff and faculty deserve GW’s absolute attention. But if officials can’t be clear about their commitment to our data privacy, we shouldn’t trust them to protect it.
From their email accounts to their location on campus, GW community members are correct in their concerns about the safety of their personal information. As the University continues the scramble to improve its outdated data privacy measures in 2023, we must demand that officials are transparent through every step in its process.

Editor’s note: This post contains references to recent shootings at the University of Virginia and Michigan State University. Contact Counseling and Psychological Services at 202-994-5300 for on-campus counseling or the National Helpline at 800-662-4357 for confidential, free 24/7 support. 
When I got a Twitter notification on Feb. 13 that Michigan State University was on lockdown, my thoughts instantly flashed back three months earlier to Nov. 13, 2022 and the University of Virginia. “There is a shooter,” my sister, Elizabeth, texted me that night. Elizabeth, a freshman majoring in biology at UVA, was considering going to the campus gym when she suddenly realized she couldn’t even leave her room.
My heart stopped when I got that text. I left in the middle of my musical theater rehearsal and called her to make sure she was OK. Huddling around my phone in the hallway of West Hall, I listened to her describe the all-caps texts that UVA’s emergency response had sent telling her to “remain sheltered in place until further notice,” an “active attacker was on campus” and she should “run, hide, fight.” I told her about everything from what I did that day to the highlights of my Tiktok For You page to keep her calm and distracted. I continued to talk to her as I jumped on the Mount Vernon Express to ride back to my residence hall in Foggy Bottom. UVA remained on lockdown for hours with the shooter still on the loose. Even from about 100 miles away, I wanted to be sure my sister was safe.
Elizabeth told me she was sheltering in place in her room, probably as far away from the violence as she could be. A few months ago, I helped her move into campus. Now, I was hearing the muffled voices on the UVA Police Department scanner reading the names of familiar campus locations, like the Culbreth Road Parking Garage, where the shooting took place, and Rugby Road, where law enforcement believed the suspect had fled.
The level of uncertainty was one of the hardest parts of grappling with the UVA shooting as a family member of a student there. We knew nothing – when it was going to end, where the shooter was or how many people had been injured. Everyone on campus had different information, and the university shared few updates. The UVA Police Department scanner kept describing random spots around campus – or “grounds,” as I can hear my sister correcting me – as locations where the suspect could possibly be. But nothing was for sure.
The lockdown ended up lasting more than 12 hours, finally ending around 10:30 a.m. UVA took a collective deep breath when Henrico County police finally apprehended the shooter the next morning nearly 70 miles away from UVA’s campus. Students could finally grieve the loss of three of their peers and hope for the recovery of two others. In the aftermath, UVA officials canceled classes for two days while the university community, native Virginians, friends and family mourned those who lost their lives in the shooting. Those who survived lost their sense of safety and now carry the added burdens of grief and fear.
But as quickly as the world learned about the shooting, they stopped talking about it. Days later, while my sister was still afraid to walk alone at night and the campus was still trying to cope with the unimaginable fallout, I felt like barely anyone outside UVA remembered what had happened. She was still grappling with the violence on her campus when I got to see her over Thanksgiving break.
The shooting at MSU took me back to that night in November. I couldn’t stop reading about the situation while it was unfolding, listening to the MSU Police scanner and constantly refreshing Twitter just trying to get the latest information. Like UVA, MSU also told its students to “run, hide, fight” – the standard but terrifying advice colleges share with students to respond to mass shootings. The lockdown at MSU lasted for four hours instead of 12, but the university’s community faced the same unimaginable grief as those at UVA. At MSU, three students also lost their lives in the shooting.
When I graduated high school last year, a part of me thought I wouldn’t have to worry about finding the best hiding spots or running from a shooter as a college student. There were 51 school shootings at K-12 schools that resulted in injuries or death in 2022 compared to one mass shooting on a college campus last year. I grew up 45 minutes away from Virginia Tech which was the site of a mass shooting in 2007. I always knew that shootings on college campuses across the country were a possibility, but I didn’t think they would impact me.
I was in elementary school at the time of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 and an eighth grader during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018, I’ve almost been desensitized to the shooting drills and practice lockdowns. But in college, my professors had yet to talk about what to do in an active shooter situation. The absence of the conversation put my mind at ease – maybe that small part of me was correct in thinking gun violence was a worry of the past.
But after two college shootings only four months apart, I’ve reverted back to my high school mindset, now more vigilant and wary of mass shootings. I don’t want to miss any texts from my family and friends in case they are in an emergency. And while my sister has started to feel safer on campus, the shooting at MSU reminded her of her own lockdown experience. She also stayed glued to the police scanner as MSU Police officers continued to investigate the scene and surrounding area.
How many more times will Elizabeth and I see tweets from emergency responders, monitor police scanners or wonder where we’d go in a mass shooting? When will these tragedies end?

GW led the A-10 in 3-pointers made, shooting at a .332 percent clip after finishing third to last in the conference in made 3-pointers last year. 
A squadron of established seniors and high-scoring additions led women’s basketball to their most successful year since the 2017-18 season, when the team last reached the NCAA tournament.
The Colonials (18-13, 9-7 A-10) finished the year tied for sixth in the Atlantic 10, and a triumvirate of players earned conference awards in Head Coach Caroline McCombs’ second year at the helm of the program. The Buff and Blue exceeded expectations in this year’s campaign, highlighted by a heroic 3-pointer from graduate student guard Mia Lakstigala in the A-10 tournament that sent the team to the quarterfinals.
In the quarterfinals, GW lost a hard-fought battle against Rhode Island, putting an end to a season that players said bound them together as a cohesive unit in the game and off the court.
“We’re very connected on the court as well as off the court,” senior guard Nya Lok said after the elimination loss. “We love each other so much, and we push each other every day, hold each other accountable.”
The team instituted a new program before the start of the season based on NBA star Stephen Curry’s daily practice routine in an effort to bolster the team’s subpar 3-point shooting – and the program paid dividends. GW led the A-10 in 3-pointers made, shooting at a .332 percent clip after finishing third to last in the conference in made 3-pointers last year with a measly .271 rate. GW skyrocketed from 207th in deep balls among Division I teams to 16th in just one year as of Monday.
But the team didn’t let their aggressive presence outside the arc deter them from dominating the boards after flinging up a shot – the team ranked second in the A-10 and 35th in the country in offensive rebounds with nearly 14 per game.
Freshman guard sensation Nya Robertson came off the bench to headline the year for the Colonials, breaking onto the scene to lead the team in scoring with 14.4 points per game and securing the A-10’s Sixth Woman of the Year honor.
Robertson, who secured a spot on the A-10’s All-Rookie team, found a steady role on the team off the bench. The Texan freshman lit up the scoreboard in the regular season – she finished second in made 3-pointers and 10th in scoring among all D1 freshmen.
Robertson said her work in Foggy Bottom wasn’t done after the loss to Rhode Island.
“Just staying locked in for the next couple of years, we’re going to be back for sure,” Robertson said.
Lakstigala, also a first-year Colonial after transferring from Penn, led the team in assists and scored 13.8 points per game.
Teammates of Lakstigala, whose last collegiate season ended with the team’s loss to Rhode Island, said the guard brought stability and star power to the team in her sole year wearing the Buff and Blue. Lok said Lakstigala is known in the locker room as “Mi-star,” a nickname she proved with a game-winning 3-pointer against Duquesne in the second round of the A-10 tourney that launched GW to the next round.
Lakstigala regularly drained deep shots, placing fifth in the conference in 3-point shooting rate with a .389 mark, making 68 of her 175 tries.
“Mia, she means so much to us,” Lok said. “We’re so lucky to have her on this team.”
McCombs said Lakstigala showed “true leadership” with her strong work ethic in the gym and the classroom – Lakstigala, an A-10 All-Academic Team honoree, was one of three Colonials to earn A-10 awards. Lakstigala showed grit across the floor, finishing second on the team in rebounds per game with 6.2.
“Mia is definitely my role model,” Robertson said. “She gets me out of bed, like ‘Let’s go get some shots up.’ She’s the life of this team.”
Redshirt senior forward Mayowa Taiwo was another key force on the team who showed athleticism on every inch of the court. She earned A-10 All-Defensive Team honors while leading the conference in offensive rebounds by more than 20. Taiwo secured the third-most rebounds per game in the conference with 9.7 per game and finished eighth in the A-10 in shooting percentage with a .491 clip.
Senior forward Faith Blethen, a four-year Colonial, wrapped up her collegiate basketball career with almost 20 starts and nearly 90 rebounds on the season.
Lok came alive during the A-10 tournament, leading the team with 41 points over the pair of games. The Australian guard started each of the team’s last seven games after an injury to senior guard Essence Brown. Lok averaged 14 points per game along that span.
Brown maintained a strong year as a starter before her injury, maintaining 6.4 points and 2.8 rebounds per game before her Feb. 5 injury.
McCombs said the experiences of the season, from the joys of a winning streak to the adversity of tough losses, showed the team’s character and love for each other.
“We’re a team of growth, of development, just committing to a process of getting better every day,” McCombs said after the loss to Rhode Island. “They teach me things every day. I really learned from them.”

Faculty and students said the endowment will decrease student debt and make the program more accessible to low-income students. 
Art therapy professors said they plan to spend a $1 million donation to their program on graduate fellowships, aiming to bring “imperative” financial support to their students.
GW parents Ulvi and Reykhan Kasimov donated a $1 million endowment to the GW Art Therapy Program late last month to fund graduate fellowships, which faculty and students said will decrease student debt and make the program more accessible to low-income students. Heidi Bardot, the director and an associate professor of the GW Art Therapy Program, said program faculty have not started designing the fellowship’s application but plan for it to launch at the beginning of the next academic year.
She said the fellowship will lower the financial burden for art therapy students, who learn to combine their art and counseling skills to help patients “heal” and “communicate” through art exercises.
The American Art Therapy Association found in a 2020 survey that art therapy, which combines art and counseling to help patients process their emotions, is an effective way to treat patients who are dealing with feelings of isolation, grief and trauma. At least 41 percent of U.S. adults have experienced at least one instance of high psychological distress since the early stages of COVID-19, according to the Pew Research Center.
“We have students who really want to give back to the community, who really want to work in the community,” Bardot said. “Yet, as with everything, GW and universities are expensive. So how do you balance those two?”
The 64 students currently pursuing a master’s degree in the art therapy program, which is housed in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, are required to complete 61 credits in courses on the intersections of psychology, art and counseling. The students in the program are also required to complete 900 internship hours that can boost their applications to become registered art therapists.
Bardot said the fellowship is a “huge financial tool” for students who could accrue more than $100,000 in student loans pursuing the program before earning $50,000 to $80,000 per year as an art therapist. GW’s art therapy masters program costs $1,750 per credit hour and is subject to an annual increase of 3 to 4 percent, according to the CCAS website.
“This is something that they’re passionate about, they actually really want to help people and they really want to give back to the community and society,” Bardot said. “Post-COVID, we know that mental health needs are increasing exponentially so it is something that the Kasimovs were really aware of in terms of mental health and the use of art.”
Bethany Eddleman – a second-year graduate student in the Art Therapy Program – said she will “probably” apply for the fellowship but added that she only has one year left in the program. She said the fellowship will relieve financial anxieties for students, allowing them to focus on their studies.
“The biggest thing is just, especially knowing how expensive grad school is, when you’re able to have that paid for and not really have to worry about the financial part of it, then you’re able to really focus and be more intentional and even more passionate,” Eddleman said.
Eddleman said her desire to help and connect with people through creative expression motivated her to study art therapy, her “passion career.” She said some common therapy techniques she’s learned about through the program include working with patients through bookmaking exercises where patients learn how to create pages for books, binding them together.
“It fits into all of my different passions – I’ll get to connect with people, I’ll get to help them meet their needs, make artwork and see the science of the artwork and how that can really impact people the same way that it impacted me,” Eddleman said.
Martina Efodzi, an adjunct professor and alumna of the Art Therapy Program, said when she enrolled in the art therapy program in 2008, the interest rates on her student loans were “ridiculous” because of the 2008 financial crisis. She said she participated in a student loan forgiveness program while working at Whitman-Walker Health, a social service agency and research institute, for about 10 years, and she expects her loans to be “discharged” this year.
“If there was a magic wand that could have been waived in 2008, where someone was willing to invest in the students at that time, that would have been life-changing for myself and for my classmates,” Efodzi said.
The art therapy program’s $1 million endowment aligns with broader University efforts to make GW more affordable for students. Officials announced the launch of a $12 million dollar-for-dollar matching scholarship to increase funds for need-based scholarships in fall 2022 and an initiative to increase aid for Pell Grant recipients by roughly $2 million each year in fall 2021.
Efodzi said financial support will help diversify the “very privileged” art therapy field, which she said historically attracts people from high-income backgrounds who can easily afford the tuition of art therapy programs. She said the fellowships will provide marginalized students with increased access to the program.
“To attract students from diverse backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, it’s imperative that there be funding to support their completion of the program and so you won’t have that diversity otherwise,” Efodzi said.

Experts in maternal health discussed issues surrounding the health inequities affecting Black people, who often have worse maternal outcomes due to systemic racism. 
A panel of health experts discussed Black maternal health problems and their history in the U.S. health care system at the University Student Center Thursday.
Experts in maternal health Uwaila Stewart, Sydney Durrah, Allison Stewart and Brenice Duroseau discussed issues surrounding the health inequities affecting Black people, who often have worse maternal outcomes due to systemic racism. The event was a part of a series of presentations during the annual Diversity Summit last week.
Uwaila Stewart, a first-year master of public health student, said the U.S. is the “most dangerous industrialized nation” to give birth in, with about 700 maternal deaths occurring annually within its borders. For Black women in the U.S., the risk of child delivery is far greater than for white women, as they are about two to three times “more likely” to die of pregnancy-related complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“As a nation, we spend more on health care than any other country in the world, yet our maternal health outcomes are some of the worst in the world,” Stewart said.
Stewart also gave a brief history on the treatment of Black women throughout U.S. medical history, including sexual violence against Black enslaved women during the Jim Crow era, James Marion Sims’ gynecological experiments on enslaved women in the late 1800s and teaching hospitals forced sterilization in the 20th century.
Stewart said reproductive health is an issue for everybody and encouraged the audience to consider it when voting on the ballot for the upcoming 2024 election.
“Be very aware and be cognizant of what’s going on,” Stewart said. “We cannot afford any more, we’ve never been able to, but we definitely can’t afford any more to just let things go and let them slide and be like, ‘You know what, somebody else will take care of it,’ because if you’re not upset about it, who’s to say anybody else will be?”
Stewart said the historical mistreatment of Black women by the American medical system is causing deaths like April Valentine, a woman who died in California in January after experiencing pain in her legs that nurses at the hospital she delivered at “ignored.”
Duroseau, a family nurse practitioner, said doctors may not listen to patients’ concerns and suggestions about their own health because of their own confidence in their skills and position of power, and she encouraged patients to counteract these common occurrences and advocate for themselves in the doctor’s office.
“We need to take it down a notch and realize we’re humans, these are humans, and we don’t know it all and medicine changes,” Duroseau said.
Durrah, a first-year master of public health student, said patients should not let doctors downplay symptoms, especially if they have a chronic condition.
“When you go to the doctor’s, don’t let them try and blame it on the fact that you have asthma because it could be more than asthma,” Durrah said.

Uriyoán Colón-Ramos, the principal investigator of the study and an associate professor of global health, said her inspiration for the study came from her own experience growing up in Puerto Rico and realizing healthy foods listed in textbooks weren’t easily accessible and didn't taste fresh. 
A Milken Institute School of Public Health professor received a $750,000 grant in December from the National Science Foundation to lead a study exploring food insecurity and climate change in Puerto Rico.
Uriyoán Colón-Ramos, the principal investigator of the study and an associate professor of global health, said she is leading a team of scholars, researchers, nonprofits and Puerto Rican food advocates to identify a strategy for nutritional and food insecurity in Puerto Rico as part of the NSF’s Convergence Accelerator program which prioritizes multifield collaboration during research projects. The study will measure the climate-friendliness of food systems in Puerto Rico and if Puerto Ricans have access to healthy food by using data from the digital app PRoduce, which connects users with small farmers and food producers in online farmer’s markets.
She said the study is currently in its first phase, marked by exploratory experiments to prepare a proposal for phase two, due in August 2023. Colón-Ramos said both phases will gather observatory diet data from the app to implement food security policy changes in Puerto Rico like the implantation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a program that financially supports low-income families for healthy food, in U.S. territories.
“I grew up in Puerto Rico, never thinking that I was going to be working in Puerto Rico,” Colón-Ramos said. “Then I started every time I would go by and I started seeing issues in my own country.”
PRoduce will help the team track customer’s shopping carts to develop an “eco-score” within the app that will monitor the climate impact and nutritional value of a certain food item.
Colón-Ramos said her inspiration for the study came from her own experience growing up in Puerto Rico and realizing healthy foods listed in textbooks weren’t easily accessible and didn’t taste fresh compared to other fruit she consumed off the island. She said the goal of the study is to let Puerto Rico lead as an example for other regions experiencing food insecurity issues through a global network of data on food production, distribution and consumption.
Puerto Rico imports more than 85 percent of its food due to the damage from recent hurricanes on small farms and cultivation, according to an agricultural assessment by the World Central Kitchen.
“How can we use that technology to collect data that can be used to promote policy change or structural changes or at least inform what would work best?” Colón-Ramos said.
Colón-Ramos said the team will collaborate with Trito Agro-Industrial Services, Inc. – a large scale composting business in Puerto Rico – in hopes of increasing access to healthy and climate-friendly foods in Puerto Rico.
Natalia Guerra Uccelli, a senior studying public health in Milken and a research assistant for the study, said her interest in the environment and global health and her Puerto Rican heritage through her dad’s side of the family drew her to the project. She said the study incorporates a variety of scientific fields like nutrition, global health and environmental health and addresses food insecurity issues in Puerto Rico.
“What I love about this project is just how overarching it is,” Guerra said. “It’s really interesting to see how all of these roles kind of come together in this project.”
Experts in nutrition and food security said the intersection of disciplines like climate change and food insecurity within the study can help expand the solutions to food insecurity.
Jessica Owens-Young, an assistant professor in the department of health studies at American University, said connecting Puerto Ricans with fresh produce through digital platforms could create a positive precedent for other regions facing food and nutrition insecurity across the world like countries in Africa, Yemen and islands in the Caribbean.
She said she wants to stress the intersectionality of the climate and economy with food insecurity because weather events like hurricanes, droughts and fires that stem from climate change can decrease the crop yield of any given year and lead to more food shortages.
“Just because someone is food-secure one month doesn’t mean the next month that they will be,” Owens-Young said. “So there’s ebbs and flows to this, and so any kind of intervention that we design should consider the nature of food insecurity and not just rely on stereotypes about it.”
Eilish Zembilci, an alumna and a nonresident adjunct fellow at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, said food insecurity typically stems from high food prices that exceed a household’s income and cost of living.
Zembilci said current food systems interfere with individuals’ access to basic needs. She said the mitigation of food insecurity lies in policies that governments can hopefully implement as a result of the models from this study.
“We need more integrated and more participatory policymaking,” Zembilci said. “That enables us to be able to cover the intersects where food is crossing into other disciplines in a way that’s really meaningful.”

Three students who spoke to The Hatchet, each with an online following ranging from 9,000 to nearly 500,000 followers, said the sponsorships aim to elevate ticket sales to nonstudents and amplify school spirit among the student body.
Student and alumni social media influencers said a local consulting firm is paying them up to $800 to promote basketball games in an attempt to bolster attendance at sporting events.
They said MtoM Consulting, a digital marketing agency based in Falls Church, Virginia, contacted students with up to 500,000 followers on TikTok or Instagram to post promotions for the men’s and women’s basketball games and link to the GW Athletics Ticketmaster site on their respective social media profiles during the spring semester. Three students who spoke to The Hatchet, each with an online following ranging from 9,000 to nearly 500,000 followers, said the sponsorships aim to elevate ticket sales to nonstudents and amplify school spirit among the student body. 
The Hatchet has identified at least seven students who have posted paid promotions of GW basketball games on Instagram or TikTok.
Kamau Louis, a former Hatchet opinions writer who graduated at the end of the fall semester, runs a TikTok account with more than 9,000 followers where he has posted promotions for the games, including a satirical announcement that he committed to the men’s basketball team as a “floor sweeper.” He said the consulting agency reached out to him over Instagram in January and offered him an opportunity to produce video promotions for GW Athletics.
“They’re just trying to increase engagement for sporting events and basketball games and overall with the University,” Louis said. “The best way to do that for students is through basketball.”
Louis said he accepted the sponsorship and worked with MtoM Consulting to set his pay rate, $200 per post for a total of $800 across four promotions.
The student sponsorships come as the latest in a series of marketing strategies the athletics department and administrators have pursued this school year to boost school spirit and encourage turnout at games. George’s Army, GW Athletics’ official student section, unveiled new merchandise and ramped up game-day tailgates and halftime fan contests in an effort to connect student-athletes to the GW community this season.
More than 3,700 people attended men’s basketball’s home game against VCU Saturday – the highest turnout for a Smith Center game since before the pandemic when 4,019 fans turned out at the Feb. 22, 2020 game against La Salle. The second most-attended home game was a Jan. 21 matchup against Dayton, which 2,380 people showed up to watch, according to men’s basketball attendance data.
Louis said officials in the athletics department approve each of his promotions before he posts them to social media, ensuring that the ad doesn’t include copyrighted material or profanities, but the ultimate topic of each post is up to him. He said the firm tracks engagement with students’ posts and the Ticketmaster link.
“They’re looking at views, engagement and also like, ‘How does this correlate between this post and increasing ticket sales of alumni buying tickets or just other people?,’” Louis said.
An athletics department spokesperson said officials have signed off on six student partnerships to promote the basketball games this academic year, amassing more than 300,000 views on sponsored videos across TikTok and Instagram. They said the department’s marketing team reviewed “more than dozens” of potential influencers to find students who would be “a good fit” for the marketing campaign.
“We like influencer marketing because it is genuine advocacy, with each influencer creating their own content based on what they enjoy about attending games,” they said in an email.
MtoM Consulting did not return a request to comment. 
Katelyn Power, a freshman with more than 476,000 followers on her ballet-focused TikTok, said athletics department officials contacted her in the beginning of November to promote the men’s basketball games, saying they needed a “difference maker” to increase ticket sales and student involvement. She said she was required to attend at least one basketball game to create two sponsorship videos.
Power’s basketball promotions included a vlog of her day on campus attending a tailgate and a men’s basketball game and a video teaching the George Washington mascot how to do ballet at the pregame tailgate.
Power declined to comment on the payment she received for the videos.
“I think that the initial reason to ask content creators like me to promote the games is because social media is a powerful advertising tool that is often underlooked and underestimated,” Power said. “As much as GW is paying to make flyers and create social media posts on their own accounts, they also want to spread their reach to as many other types of people as possible.”
Abigail Francis, a junior with nearly 297,000 followers on TikTok, said MtoM Consulting messaged her over Instagram in November offering her a contract to post two promotional videos for the Jan. 21 men’s basketball game against Dayton on TikTok and Instagram.
Francis said she accepted the contract in December, setting a rate of $200 per post. She said she signed a second contract last month with the same rate of pay to promote men’s basketball with posts for the Feb. 15 game against George Mason, their Feb. 25 game against La Salle and the women’s basketball game against Davidson Feb. 22.
“It was fun,” Francis said. “I mean, I got to go to GW basketball games and call it work.”
Francis said the marketing agency sent her a list of “do’s and don’ts” before she started producing content for the athletics department, which encouraged her to wear GW merchandise, post with GW-related phrases like “Raise High” and motivate other students and alumni through the videos to attend the games. She said the list prohibited consuming alcohol before games, using profanities in posts or talking “poorly” about GW basketball players or the University. 
She said she released four total videos for the four games, taking part in TikTok trends that highlighted the fan experience at basketball games, like a video about “things at GW that just make sense,” which showcased free pizza, performances from the GW Cheer Team and First Ladies and GW’s mascot.
“It was very much up to whatever I wanted to do,” Francis said. “I’d say just something to catch people’s eye.”
Francis said MtoM Consulting tracked the engagement of her posts through the influencer marketing performance website InfluenceKit, which monitored the shares, views, likes and comments of each promotion. 
“Historically, we do not have a lot of people come to the games, both students and paid ticket customers, and it was specifically aiming to increase paid ticket customers,” Francis said.
The other students who have posted promotional videos of GW basketball games to TikTok marked as paid partnerships throughout this year’s basketball season include senior Kate Carpenter, who has nearly 4,300 followers on TikTok, Danielle Villardi, who has more than 1,100 followers on the app, and Melina Golembiewski, who has more than 6,000 followers. Carpenter, Villardi and Golembiewski have also nearly amassed a combined 12,000 Instagram followers between their respective accounts.
Carpenter, Villardi and Golembiewski each did not return requests to comment.
