Free speech is fundamental to the health of a college campus, and limiting it in any respect will stunt the dynamic dialogue emblematic of a university environment.
Students should not only feel safe to express their beliefs but also have the opportunity to be exposed to a wide-variety of viewpoints and perspectives without fear.
But this need for an absolute acceptance of free speech was threatened by a policy presented for debate in The GW Law School student senate.
The policy would alert the community if a “hate group,” as labeled by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, would be participating in a campus event. Additional security would also be provided at these flagged events.
The policy was initially proposed by third-year law student Samantha Ames, after she was allegedly verbally assaulted and physically intimidated by the leader of The Family Research Council, an organization that has been branded a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
This policy, while well-intentioned, represents a dangerous attack on free speech and the exchange of ideas at the University.
The bill, of course, would not ban controversial groups. Any group invited would be welcome to speak, as long as they consent to being called a hate group. This is dangerous as the two groups vested with the power to decide who is and isn’t hateful are driven by their own ideological leanings, which interferes with their ability to objectively label others. Because of this, it is more likely that conservative groups will be labeled as hate groups rather than liberal ones. GW might be a left-leaning institution, but its students cannot support a policy that would unfairly mark some conservative groups as hateful while ignoring that groups from across the political spectrum spread hate.
The potential for censorship, diminished dialogue and limited free speech is simply too great to consider.
It is the community’s obligation to provide every student, speaker or organization an equal forum to present their opinions, no matter how controversial or “hateful” their message may be. Support for free speech means support for all speech no matter how vile or hurtful it can be. There are no clauses or qualms when supporting free speech.
The bill will likely never make it past the law school student senate, but its existence could cause some to question the University’s commitment to having a fair and open dialogue, as it is hard to separate administrator initiatives from student culture when evaluating a school.
This reputation would in turn have the effect of dissuading groups that might not be hate groups, yet are considered controversial or outspoken from coming to campus. And this would be extremely detrimental to having an open and honest discourse on campus.
The emotions that arise when these sorts of groups visit are charged and can be incendiary. But labeling an outside group as “hateful” and requiring that it has more security only takes the community’s focus away from what such a group’s visit is about: A constructive dialogue where people can come together and have a difficult but necessary conversation.

Bullying is a troubling national issue.
For the 13 million young people, according to the documentary film “Bully,” who are taunted and harassed each year, ignoring nasty comments and their tormentors is not an option.
But contrary to the perception of bullying as a problem that exclusively plagues middle and high school students, the abuse does not stop there.
And in many ways, it gets even messier as bullying moves online.
In college, bullying is often propagated virtually, and students are able to hide behind the anonymity the Internet provides. The taunts are just as nasty, but now, through remarks made on sites such as College ACB, Facebook and even Ironic GW Memes, they can continue at all hours.
Assistant Dean of Students Tara Pereira is searching for the balance between censoring beliefs and stopping bullies. She told The Hatchet in March she wants to cut down on “uncivil” behavior by potentially changing the Code of Student Conduct to stress positive online behavior and interactions.
GW has the power to extend a stronger policing arm against bullying, but it’s good that the University has decided against it. Ultimately, the onus to end bullying is on us as students.
That said, the University can make efforts to foster a more positive culture on campus through some small institutionalized steps.
And that culture can begin from day one. P.M. Forni’s “Choosing Civility: The Twenty-five Rules of Considerate Conduct” could become required reading for all students starting with the Class of 2016. It might seem small, but steps such as these emphasize to the student body that maintaining at least a basic degree of courtesy is crucial to the community.
And this is something the University’s namesake would surely endorse. George Washington himself transcribed “Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation,” an outline of 110 ways to maintain respect and positive interactions with others.
If it was good enough for Washington, it should be good enough for GW.
While the University can attempt to protect students from harmful or hate-driven actions, it’s our role as students to halt bullying.
Standing up to harsh words and petty comments is the only way to truly rid the community of this toxic culture. And if we want to promote ourselves as members of a progressive, inclusive community, it’s a step we have to take.
In March, the University’s Student Athlete Advisory Council produced an anti-bullying video that reached out to bullied students to tell them it gets better, and called on students to stand up for victims. This is a great step. Students need to step up and make a culture where harmful words aren’t exchanged.
In his book, Forni explains, “To be fully human we must be able to imagine others’ hurt and to relate it to the hurt we would experience if we were in their place.”
A little more appreciation for this rule might do some good for the community.

As a volunteer in a hospital emergency room it was often my job to review hospital bills with patients, including those for people who were uninsured.
In other words, I was forced to explain why an MRI and a Band-Aid cost upward of $2,000.
These days, I can’t seem to remember the names and faces of those patients. But as hard as I try, the heartbreak is something that I just can’t forget.
But it appears there’s a good chance this will continue. Over the course of the last two weeks, it has become increasingly apparent that the individual mandate for the health care overhaul is unlikely to survive the high court’s judicial review in its present form.
The concept of universal health care can be applied to a smaller community with fewer legal restrictions, and I have no doubt that it would best serve the interests of those involved.
If the United States isn’t ready for universal health care, I figure GW is a good place to start.
Private universities, unlike the federal government, are not strictly bound by the U.S. Constitution. Accordingly, administrators enjoy considerable latitude when it comes to imposing regulations upon enrolled students.
Last fall, Michigan State University implemented a policy that required all incoming students to purchase health insurance. Under the new mandate, undergraduates without existing coverage may either select an insurance plan of their own, or are automatically enrolled in the MSU-sponsored Aetna program.
Considering that GW offers a similar package through Aetna, this policy could be adopted by our own institution.
Like most college students, GW undergraduates are particularly susceptible to illness and injury. We live in moldy, dusty dorms – the ideal breeding grounds for viral strains such as the infamous Norovirus we saw in February.
Moreover, we all make our fair share of poor decisions. In fact, over the course of the last decade, the rate of hospitalizations among 18 to 24 year-olds rose by 25 percent for alcohol overdoses and 56 percent for drug overdoses, according to a National Institutes of Health study conducted from 1999 to 2008.
While the number of college-age hospital patients is on the rise, so is the cost of their medical bills.
Without health insurance, emergency room bills can range anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Not only is this enough to jeopardize a family’s finances, but it can also deter uninsured students from visiting the hospital at all. When experiencing legitimate health concerns, students shouldn’t have to fear treatment.
If students were required to purchase insurance before attending school, they would be protected against such unfortunate circumstances.
Needless to say, universal health care remains a contentious subject in the public eye.
MSU’s new policy has drawn the criticism of some Republican politicians who claim that the mandate places an unnecessary financial burden on already-struggling families. In February, state Rep. Kevin Cotter, R–Mt. Pleasant, called for MSU administrators to testify in front of the Michigan House Appropriations Subcommittee on Higher Education.
Michigan State University Provost Kim Wilcox responded that health care often saves money in the long run, adding that insured students are also more likely to thrive in the classroom.
“Protecting our students’ health helps to ensure their class attendance and, in turn, their academic success; and it helps to protect the significant financial and personal investment that they and their families have made in their education,” Wilcox testified.
Clearly, a little controversy isn’t enough to shake the convictions of MSU administrators. Why should we let it be enough to stop GW?
Although some may view it as an inconvenience, a University-wide health care mandate would protect students from the costs related with unforeseen illness and injury. More importantly, it would provide their friends and families with an even more valuable commodity – peace of mind.
No American should have to fear their next doctor’s bill. If we can’t get health care to work for America, let’s at least start with GW.

A Democratic congressman from New Jersey will headline the May 19 graduation ceremony for the College of Professional Studies.
Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J. – one of two physicists in Congress – is best known for his advocacy on energy and intelligence issues. He has represented the state’s 12th district, located in central New Jersey, since 1999.
First-year Graduate School of Political Management Director Mark Kennedy said he handpicked Holt after the two served in Congress together from opposite sides of the aisle. The Graduate School of Political Management is housed in the College of Professional Studies and the program’s attend the larger graduation ceremony.
“The kind of experience Rush Holt and I had working together is the type of experiences that I want to help promulgate,” Kennedy said. “I’ve always said that when I was in Congress, I tried to get to know all the Democrats I could. We might disagree on 99 out of 100 issues, but we can work together on the one issue we do agree on.”
Kennedy, a Republican who sat in the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007, said the choice underscores a message of bipartisanship because the two congressmen cosponsored an education bill.
The Teachers for Tomorrow’s Careers Act of 2005 looked to boost the number of scientists teaching in high schools. The bill died in committee.
In choosing the speaker, Kennedy said he was looking to spread a message of “making sure that you’re also looking at shared interests, shared goals. It’s part of the solution that we can shine a brighter light on.”
Holt, 63, is also a five-time “Jeopardy” champion. He also sponsored a 2010 bill to combat cyberbullying in the aftermath of a student’s suicide at Rutgers University.
The Graduate School of Political Management has a history of landing high-profile D.C. politicos as commencement speakers. In 2008, former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough addressed graduates, and George W. Bush’s senior advisor Karl Rove spoke in 2006.

Nine-year Notre Dame assistant coach Jonathan Tsipis will take the helm of the Colonials, the University announced Friday, becoming the ninth head coach in women’s basketball program history.
Tsipis, who served as the associate head coach of the Fighting Irish for the past four seasons, boasts significant collegiate coaching experience – a qualification athletic director Patrick Nero said was a key aspect of the search. At Notre Dame, Tsipis saw the team earn a 228-77 record over nine seasons, and helped the program to five NCAA Sweet 16 appearances, including back-to-back championship games over the past two seasons.
“My feeling really was we needed to get somebody in here that had been at a premier program and knew how those type of programs do things every single day,” Nero said. “Those programs aren’t made overnight, they are daily habits, and I just wanted to make sure we had somebody that had lived that for many years.”
Nero, who began a search for the new women’s head coach following Mike Bozeman’s dismissal in March, was also drawn to Tsipis’ commitment to student-athlete success off the court. The new head coach boasts a 100 percent graduation rate for student-athletes, and underlined the importance of education throughout his introductory press conference Friday.
“I wanted to be in a situation where it was a program and a university that really valued student-athletes,” Tsipis said. “And I think there are very few places in the country that put those things together well, and a program where women’s basketball is supported at a high level. And there’s been a tradition of championships without sacrificing anything at the academic side.”
Off-court student success is quickly becoming a mandate for GW coaches. Nero boasted about men’s basketball head coach Mike Lonergan’s 100 percent graduation rate upon his hire last May, and the recently released department review stressed the need for athletic and academic players.
At Notre Dame, Tsipis honed his scouting and recruiting abilities, working to craft strategies that carried the team to victories over multiple nationally-ranked opponents. Most important to his coaching style, he said, is ensuring his players have a grasp of fundamentals, and control over their play.
“I don’t think there’s a specific style. I think if people watched our Notre Dame teams play, they saw a certain amount of discipline, and they saw kids that were fundamentally sound,” Tsipis said.
Tsipis also spoke to the importance of building a strong program with solid recruiting, and underlined his desire to build “unbelievable team chemistry.” He’s already met with all four of the recruits that signed National Letters of Intent under Bozeman, Tsipis said, and he sat down with the current Colonials roster. As of yet, no recruits or current GW players have announced plans to leave the team.
“I plan on spending a lot of time in individual meetings with [the current players] and I talked a little bit to them at the meeting about my goals for not only the team, but for them individually,” Tsipis said. “That this isn’t a question of being good in a couple of years, I’m not ready to wait. I’m ready to get this thing going.”
His hire comes as the athletics department implements the results of a yearlong review designed to overhaul the direction of athletics programs at GW. The review underlines the need for improvements to facilities, resources and personnel in wide-spread efforts to raise teams’ levels of competition.
The women’s basketball team finished 11-18 overall on the 2011-12 season, after a four-year program slide that saw GW compile a 42-75 record and fail to advance past the first round of the A-10 tournament. Nero, University President Steven Knapp and Tsipis all see the new head coach’s vast range of experience as the quality that will enable him to instrument a program turn-around.
“You name it at Notre Dame, I’ve had experience in it. I’ve done scheduling, I’ve been the recruiting coordinator since the day I stepped onto campus,” Tsipis said. “ [Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw] is a Hall of Famer for a lot of reasons, and I think one is her ability to groom assistants to be successful head coaches.”
Another key decision that Tsipis will need to make in the coming days is rounding out his coaching staff. While Kristin Cole, an assistant coach under Bozeman and former Notre Dame player, was in attendance at the reception Friday, Tsipis said his hiring decisions are still pending. He added that while he has yet to officially decide on a staff, he intends for it to have Notre Dame ties.
“I do know that I want to make sure I have a diverse staff that understands the importance of recruiting to the George Washington University. It’s going to be a staff that has expertise in different areas. I was a point guard – I won’t have four point guards. Former players, playing experience is very important to me,” Tsipis said. “There will be some Notre Dame ties to my staff. Those people – whether they’ve played with me, worked with me – know me the best.”
Senior center Sara Mostafa and senior forward Tara Booker, both of whom will return to the Colonials for their fifth year with the team, said Tsipis’ evident passion will motivate GW as it makes the transition into a new coaching staff. In his initial meeting with the team Friday, Booker said, their new coach handed out a sheet that broke down the Colonials’ day into 22- and two-hour segments: the “two” representing basketball, and the 22 “emphasizes being a student, and enjoying D.C. It’s about the academics and the social, not just about basketball,” Booker said.
“We could see that he’s passionate about everything that he’s saying, and it really, for me, it made me excited to get on the court and get ready and have the whole staff and start practice,” Mostafa said. “It just made me really excited to start next season and be successful, finally.”
Tsipis was one of CollegeInsider.com’s Top 10 active assistant coaches in the nation in 2011, and is a former recipient of BasketballScoop.com’s Assistant Coach of the Year Award, which has five recipients each season. Among the players he has mentored are four All-Americans, two WNBA draft picks and a Big East Conference Player of the Year.
Tsipis logged stints on the staffs of the men’s basketball program at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, two seasons as an assistant men’s coach at Elon and one year as an assistant coach at LeMoyne College. He also spent three seasons on the men’s basketball staff at Cornell and a year on the men’s basketball staff at Duke.

Crowning a freshman takes a lot of time, energy and rehearsal.
Six freshmen stood at center stage Saturday, their hair and nails done, dressed in floor-length evening dresses that glistened under the bright lights, ready to compete in the 10th annual Miss Freshman Scholarship Pageant.
Sponsored by the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, the pageant competition is open to all female freshmen.
Freshman Fionnghuala O’Reilly said she wakes up every morning by 7 a.m. to get to her classes at 8 a.m. The systems engineering major and double minor in business administration and naval science said that after sitting through three or four classes every day, she tries to take a quick nap and do homework before the nightly two- to three- and sometimes even four-hour pageant rehearsals.
“We practiced the dance, our walking, our interview – pretty much everything,” O’Reilly said.
O’Reilly said waking up on a Saturday to be at practice by 10 a.m. was not always the easiest choice, but that bonding with her fellow contestants has made the sacrifices more than worthwhile.
For the pageant, the women choreographed a dance, and each preformed a talent. They also practiced public speaking and learned how best to articulate questions in the short answer response section of the competition. A mentor in the sorority helped guide them through this process.
“It was a very long journey,” contestant Dominique Jones said, adding that practices could run long as the weight of tests and homework also took their toll.
Jones said taking 17 credits this semester on top of rehearsing taught her time management skills and helped her overcome her personal shyness and fear of public speaking.
The event serves dual purposes, creating an outlet for freshmen to meet each other and older mentors in the sorority, while also raising money for charity. This year’s donation recipient is Heifer International.
The community service aspect is something O’Reilly says attracted her to the pageant.
As part of the service component, she went to Miriam’s Kitchen.
“One thing on my bucket list is to be in a pageant, and now that I did it, it didn’t really matter to me who would win,” she said.
O’Reilly not only crossed it off her list, but she won too, taking home the crown and sash, along with the first place award, a $1,000 prize.
The first runner up award, a $500 prize, went to Francisca Cromwell and the second runner up prize, a $250 award, went to Dionne O’Bannon.
Alumna Raquel Pinkney founded the pageant and was in the audience Saturday to cheer on her younger sorority sisters and their freshman contestants.
Pinkney says she founded the event as a way to give back to the community, while specifically keeping the minority community in mind, and to introduce freshmen to each other outside of class while completing community service.
“To see something that you created and that you only thought was going to be happening that year, to know that people enjoy it so much and that they are going to continue with its legacy, that is such a great thing,” Pinkney said.
She added that her time planning the pageant taught her how to be a great event planner, to be a team player, a negotiator and how to be prepared for the real world.
“AKA is what you live and breathe. Just like your school work, you live and breathe it,” Pinkney said.
As this year’s overall winner mingled with her friends who came out to support her and hugged her mom, who travelled to the pageant from North Carolina, the Naval ROTC member said while clutching her crown, flowers and sash, skydiving was the next challenge to cross off her list.

The University-wide career center will offer personalized support in six industry-specific areas starting next year, a departure from its current generalized approach.
The center’s professional staff – which will be swelling by about a dozen members by 2015 – will each focus on one of six clusters: arts, media and communication; science, technology, engineering and math; public policy, government, law and international development and affairs; health sciences, nursing, medicine and public health; education, training and social services and business and economics.
The clusters will cater to the University’s increasing focus on interdisciplinary work, so that students with majors in environmental studies, for example, can look into political or business career paths more easily.
“This will basically complement your major,” Dean of Students Peter Konwerski said, adding that the clusters will link students’ majors to industries and help faculty from various schools connect with one another. “We’re thinking about the way we can bring more content to students earlier.”
Four groups, formed earlier this semester from the Career Services Task Force, will spend the next few weeks determining specific steps that will bring about broader changes over the next three years. The groups, overseen by Konwerski and Executive Director of the Office of the Dean of Students Robert Snyder, focus on career development, operations, employer relations and student employment.
As these groups shape the revamp, the career development team is looking at how to best to balance job preparation with a liberal arts education. Career advisers, including those from the GW School of Business, argue that students’ courses should be integrated with career preparation to best coach students on post-graduation plans. But academic advisers, such as those from the Elliott School of International Affairs, believe the roles of each adviser should be separate.
Larry Fillian, director of undergraduate advising and assessment for the business school, sees the career services overhaul as “a great opportunity to transform its advising and career coaching for students.”
This career center has served as a model for GW’s transition to industry-specific support for undergraduates. Business students participate in a First Year Development Program, in addition to a required career management course, Fillian said. The academic advisers and career coaches collaborate on creating the courses.
Fillian stressed that academic and career advisers need to work together to translate classroom experiences into real world applications.
“I feel that all of our advisers on this campus are keenly interested in developing stronger ties with the Career Center so that we can combine our extensive knowledge of student development, advising, and career development to provide a much stronger service set to students,” he said.
While the business school puts a spotlight on jobs, the Elliott School takes a more academic-focused approach to career preparation.
Though academic advisers do not typically provide in-depth career advice for Elliott School students, members of the GW Career Center regularly drop by the advising office to talk to students about jobs in international affairs.
Tammy Wiles, director of academic advising in the Elliott School, said keeping academic and career advising separate allows each staff member to retain strengths in one area.
“In academic advising, we have a certain agenda. We have to make sure you get through school in four years,” Wiles said.
She said putting too much emphasis on job training may thwart students’ exploration of academic areas outside their career paths, and the advisers – while knowledgeable about school requirements and course content – are not typically experts in a particular field.
“We have to be very careful. We can’t be all things to all people,” Wiles, who also spent more than a decade directing the Elliott School’s graduate career center, said.
Wiles added that she doesn’t think the University will firmly decide how academic and career advisers should collaborate until the new head of career services is hired. The new senior administrator – a key component of the proposed overhaul – will oversee career support across the University. A title has not yet been formalized, but the leader will likely be hired in June, Konwerski said.
This post was updated on April 9, 2012 to reflect the following:
Due to a reporting error, The Hatchet incorrectly reported Larry Fillian’s title. He is the director of undergraduate advising and assessment for the business school.
