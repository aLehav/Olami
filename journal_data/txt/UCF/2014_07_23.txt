Former UCF quarterback Blake Bortles is getting to see the perks of being an NFL quarterback.
The popular football video game series, ‘Madden’ rated Bortles as the top quarterback in the 2014 draft class, with a 78 overall rating. Publisher of the video game, EA Sports released a video of the rookies reacting to their ratings.
Bortles just wanted to know what his punting ability was.

Although Bortles is the top rated Madden rookie skill-wise, he’s behind his fellow first-round drafted QBs in jersey sales. Johnny Manziel is currently the top-selling jersey in the NFL, followed by Teddy Bridgewater who is the no. 13 selling jersey and finally Bortles is the no. 18 selling jersey. 
Even though he’s third in jersey sales for the rookie QBs, cracking the top 20 puts him ahead of established NFL quarterbacks such as Ryan Tannehill of the Miami Dolphins and Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis Colts.
