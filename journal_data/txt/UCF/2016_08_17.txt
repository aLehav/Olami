Many universities are in the fight to join the Big 12 Collegiate Conference this year, including the University of Central Florida and the University of South Florida. 
USF made a big push by referring to themselves as a top research university, but in their letter to the Big 12, made an ironic mistake.
While pushing themselves as a top research university, USF misspelled the word research in their letter. 
They spelt research as ‘reasearch’.

Now it should be noted that this letter was in its draft form and had not officially been submitted at the time of the error. The draft form was obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, according to Yahoo Sports, and the mistake has since been corrected.
