The UCF Recreation and Wellness Center will close next week starting August 8 and will remain closed until August 16 for annual maintenance.
Not to worry, students will still have a gym on campus to work out at.
While the main RWC is closed, the Knights Plaza gym across the street from the CFE Arena will be open from 11am-9pm. Student can park at Garage F near the dorms without a permit but may not leave their car there overnight.
