On Friday, Tulsa beat Hawaii in the Sheraton Hawaii Bowl by an impressive 62-35 score. In 2005, UCF came within one point of winning the Hawaii Bowl against Nevada, with the Knights losing in overtime 49-48. The Knights went to Hawaii after losing the C-USA Championship game to Tulsa back in 2005. 
But 2010 seems to be UCF’s year. With both the 2010 C-USA Championship football team and basketball teams ranked nationally in the top 25 — historic firsts for both programs — the Knights are aiming to make a bigger statement by beating the Georgia Bulldogs in the Liberty Bowl on Dec. 31, 2010. 
The Knights fly up to Memphis on Monday, and will spend time practicing and volunteering at St. Jude’s. Check back for our coverage of UCF’s road to the bowl, but before the Knights get the national spotlight, another Florida team will compete in a bowl game tonight, Dec. 26. 
Florida International University is set to take on Toledo in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl in Detroit. That game kicks off at 8:30 p.m. and can be seen on ESPN. FIU only joined the Sun Belt conference in 2005, and is looking to prove itself in its first ever bowl game. They’ll have to face a tough crowd, since Toledo fans are closer and expected to travel better. Toledo finished second in the MAC West. 
We’ll keep providing updates of Florida bowls and, of course, the Liberty Bowl as the Knightsmake their trip to Memphis. Check back for updates, and if you’re going to the Liberty Bowl, share your pics and stories with us by emailing news@knightnews.com.
