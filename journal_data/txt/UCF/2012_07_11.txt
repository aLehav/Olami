On Tuesday afternoon, the First Lady of the President of the United States stopped by UCF to rally support for President Obama’s hopeful reelection in 2012.
The heat index, which was nearing 100℉, did not stop thousands of students and supporters who came to the event. The line for the rally stretched all the way around the new arena to the road by Garage D.
Along with the supporters, came some protestors. The UCF College Republicans protested the event by holding up signs that said “Stop Socializing America” and “Go Back to Chicago”.

Arguably UCF’s most prominent alumni, comedian Daniel Tosh, took heat for directing rape jokes at a woman during his recent performance at the Hollywood Laugh Factory.
It all started when Tosh said that rape jokes are always funny, this prompted a female audience member to stand up and yell, “Actually, rape jokes are never funny!”
This caused Tosh to make a joke at that woman directly saying, “Wouldn’t it be funny if that girl got raped by like, five guys right now?” This all according the woman’s Tumblr page.
Shortly after, the woman’s Tumblr page went viral, causing Tosh to be criticized by many including Katherine Hull, the spokesperson for the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network.
“When will this funny man realize that rape jokes aren’t funny? By suggesting that an audience member deserved to be gang raped, Tosh took his shtick to a new low,” Hull told FOX411, “Applause is due to the woman who had the guts to vocalize what many in room were thinking.”
Tosh shortly after apologized on Twitter where he tweeted to his 6.1 million followers, “All the out of context misquotes aside, I’d like to sincerely apologize.”
It is also interesting to note that ex-MTV star Andy Milonakis threatened to have Tosh beat up via Twitter, in turn, Tosh quickly replied with the Tweet below:
