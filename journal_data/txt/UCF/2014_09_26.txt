UCF just had some fuel added to the fire for the Oct. 2 game on the road against the Houston Cougars.
Houston wide receiver Deontay Greenberry had an interview with Chris Shelton of the student-run newspaper The Daily Cougar and was critical of the UCF football team.
Although the Knights beat Houston 19-14 in 2013 and went on the win a BCS-bowl, Greenberry wasn’t impressed.
“Last year, to me, in my opinion, they weren’t that good. They happened to overcome to come up with the W,” Greenberry told Shelton, who tweeted out the quote.
Greenberry was also confident that Houston will take care of UCF easily in their upcoming matchup.
“We don’t really expect this game to be close. … We want to really get after these guys from the jump and hit them in the mouth,” Greenberry told Shelton.
Although UCF senior defensive back Jordan Ozerities didn’t directly respond to Greenberry’s comments, he did send a tweet out.
“We just got tried… #motivation,” Ozerities tweeted out.
The Knights will travel to play Houston Oct. 2 at 7 p.m. and the game will be aired on ESPN.
