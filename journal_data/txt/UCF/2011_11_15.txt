Final score: Watch the Throne (Immortals) 26; Phi Delt 18
The match up comes after Phi Delt and the Immortals, seeds 4 and 2 respectively, remained undefeated in the regular season, with each team suffering only one tie. 
Tonight’s winner receives a coveted UCF IM Sports championship t-shirt, along with funding to represent UCF in a national tournament in either New Orleans or College Station, Texas. 
But the game has impacts beyond the T-shirt.
Right now Phi Delt is ranked No. 1 in Greek Cup points, and they’d receive additional bonus points for remaining undefeated and winning this top comp division tournament. Phi Delt is hoping to win its third Greek Cup in a row this year — something that’s never been done by a fraternity ever at UCF. 
As for the Immortals, already this year they have achieved regional tournament victories at the Swamp Bowl in Gainesville and the UCF regional tournament here on campus, thus earning bids to both national tournaments already. So for the Immortals, winning this game in a decisive manner becomes more a matter of pride and a statement — rather than a ticket to nationals, which they already earned.
