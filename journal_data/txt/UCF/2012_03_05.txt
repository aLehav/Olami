On February 20, 2010, recent UCF graduate Scott Patrick Wilson, 23, was killed in a car accident after Billionaire polo mogul, John Goodman, hit Wilson’s car, which ended up overturned at the bottom of a canal, according to reports. 
Goodman was deemed to have a blood alcohol level nearly twice the legal limit in Florida and had, hours earlier, ordered 10 shots of tequila and a round of Irish Car Bombs, although it wasn’t clear how much of those drinks he actually consumed, the Sun-Sentinel reports.

Beginning Tuesday, official trial proceedings will start on the DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide case against Goodman. Six Palm Beach County residents will be chosen to serve as the jury and decide the fate of Goodman. If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison.Sponsored ad, story continues below:

Wilson was returning to Wellington from Orlando for his sister’s 19th birthday when his car was struck by Goodman’s Bentley. A passerby stopped when she saw the damaged Bentley on the side of the road called 911. The car was empty and no sign of another vehicle was seen. Goodman had walked about 100 yards down 120th Avenue to Kampsen’s barn, looking for a phone, according to the Sun-Sentinel.
Goodman borrowed a cell phone from a woman and proceeded to call his girlfriend in Atlanta to tell her he had been involved in an accident. It is reported that he did not call 911 until nearly an hour after the accident.
KnightNews.com will follow the trial until the very end. Keep checking back for updates.



UPDATE: News from the Facilities Operations and the Department of Landscape reports that “the birds are hitting the glass of the windows in some areas of the building. Apparently, they think it is an open area and they hit the glass in their attempt to enter the building.” 
Orange County Animal Services and the local office of Fish and Wildlife Services said that this is a very common situation around buildings with glass windows, especially in the nesting season of some species of birds.

Several birds were found dead outside of the music building at the Performing Arts Center on UCF’s campus. A student found about seven dead birds while walking through and reported the situation to KnightNews.com. 
The student, who told us the birds had no apparent physical trauma, was worried an environmental factor could have caused the deaths. (See the video the student shot himself and sent us, below.)
KnightNews.com contacted UCF’s Environmental Health & Safety Coordinator who said that UCF does not believe, based on initial information, that there is any threat to the UCF community.

“After talking with some of the departments in Facilities and Safety, the preliminary information we have is suggesting that the reason for the death of the birds is not related to an unsafe situation that could affect the UCF Community,” Noel Crespo told KnightNews.com.

The mystery still remains however, as to what caused these birds to die.
“I am still in the process of gathering information before getting to a final conclusion,” Crespo added.
We will continue to follow this matter and report any other mysterious animal deaths around campus. 
KnightNews.com is currently checking into additional tips of bird deaths elsewhere on campus viewers sent us after this story broke. 
If UCF can find out what caused these birds to die, KnightNews.com will let you know.
