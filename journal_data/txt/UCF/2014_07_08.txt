The Sigma Chi fraternity has been reinstated as of July 7, according to the reinstatement letter sent by Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities Director Dana Juntunen.
“At this time, I have determined to accept the recommendation of the committee and terminate your suspension effective immediately,” Juntunen said in the letter to Sigma Chi fraternity president Connor Hasson.
The fraternity was suspended in March 2013 after being found “in-violation” of university policy for hazing, disruptive conduct and alcohol related misconduct. Originally suspended until the end of fall 2016, the fraternity had their suspension readjusted in June 2013, taking two years off of their suspension.
After completion of all of the educational sanctions/requirements, the fraternity requested modification of their suspension status to be in good standing with the university for the fall 2014 semester.
“We feel as if Sigma Chi has gone above and beyond the expectations of their disciplinary sanctions. They have developed a plan which addresses alcohol consumption within the organization for both of age and underage members,” the reinstatement letter said.
During the 2014-2015 year, Sigma Chi has committed to a plan to ensure the year will be alcohol free. The house will remain dry until deemed ready by the university, national chapter and Sigma Chi chapter.
