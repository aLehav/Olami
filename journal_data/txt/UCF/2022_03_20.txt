After knocking in-state rival 10-seed Florida Gators out of the first round of the 2022 NCAA Tournament to pick up their first ever tournament win, the UCF Lady Knights will face one of the most prestigious programs in college basketball history.

The 7-seed Knights will take on the 2-seed UConn Huskies in the Round of 32 on Monday.  The game will be nationally televised on ESPN with tip-off scheduled for 9 pm at Gampel Pavillion in Mansfield, CT.
The Huskies are no new enemy to the Knights, as the teams are former conference foes from when UConn was previously in the American Athletic Conference from 2013-2020.
During that seven-year span, the Knights took on the Huskies 13 times, losing every single game.
The last matchup between the teams came in Feb 2020, when the Knights fell 66-53 to the Huskies in Storrs, CT.
This is a different UCF team, however.
Fresh off a regular season conference championship, a conference tournament championship, and a first round victory vs. their in-state rival, the Knights have momentum in their favor this go-around.
The winner of Monday’s contest will advance take on the winner of 3-seed Indiana vs 11-seed Princeton in the Sweet 16.
