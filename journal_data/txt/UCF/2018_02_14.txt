University of Central Florida Student Government Speaker of the Senate, Josh Bolona, went to high school at Stoneman Douglas and shared his thoughts on this tragedy with Knight News:
“Watching it develop was heartbreaking and gut-turning, especially still personally knowing students and staff on campus. We went through an untimely death of an extremely loving friend during Junior year of high school. The spirit and positivity the campus bounced back with was inspirational. I have no doubt the same will happen this time around. Prayers will be echoing through around the nation and world. #DouglasStrong.”
