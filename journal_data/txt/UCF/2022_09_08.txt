After a dominant start to the season, the Knights will get the opportunity to take down old ACC rival, the Louisville Cardinals at home on Friday. Here’s what every fan in Knight Nation needs to know and experience for the second game of the season against Louisville.  
As any UCF fan whose lived in the central Florida area for a period of time knows that when its hot, it often rains a lot every other day. The weather for Friday’s game is looking quite rainy at 60% so be prepared for possible game delays and pre-game festivity cancellations/postponements.  
But if you are game to cheer on your Knights no matter what, bring those ponchos and umbrellas and get ready for the Knights’ second home game of the season!

For those that have their tailgate lots reserved ahead of time, All lots will open at 3:30 p.m. and Knight fans can get tailgates set up at little earlier at 2:30 p.m. in the Gold Zone if they have a football game-day parking permit.

IOA Plaza will open to the GENERAL public at 3:30 p.m. with tents up with giveaways from local sponsors and vendor tents lined up with games such as cornhole set up on the lawns.   
If you get to the tailgate early and want to get the competitive juices flowing, the UCF Volleyball team will take on the UNC Wilmington at 4:30 p.m. at the Venue just a short walking distance from FBC Mortgage Stadium.  
The team picked up right where they left off last season as UCF Graduate student McKenna Melville led the Knights in a sweep of the weekend in the UCF Challenge beating Syracuse and Kansas State to kick off their season.

Students with CLAIMED tickets to matchup against the bulldogs will be able to enter through the student gates which will open at 5:30 p.m. with all other gates opening at 6 p.m. Student gates will be located at (6-9).
