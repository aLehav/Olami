The SGA impeachment scandal has exploded into a firestorm of controversy, with the accused senator alleging half the senate drinks during meetings, and a senate committee choosing to shut out the media when likely discussing the issue of Pozin drinking on the job with witnesses in secrecy Friday.
Sources in SGA have confirmed to KnightNews.com tensions are mounting in the office, with many wondering if they could be accused of an impeachable offense next.
During an interview with KnightNews.com immediately following a senate committee meeting where Sen. Jereme Pozin’s impeachment was discussed, Pozin sat down with KnightNews.com and explained that if SGA creates a precedent that senators should be under no alcoholic influence while on the job, then half of Senate should already be impeached.
“During the 9 p.m. (senate) bathroom break, at least half of senate has had a beer at Wackadoos before,” Pozin said. “At least half of senate has had some type of alcoholic beverage in them at senate.”
The sweeping allegations against half the senate come as the SGA LJR committee engaged in an unprecedented practice of holding secret meetings as part of the impeachment proceedings. A former LJR chairman who oversaw Webster Cook’s impeachment proceedings confirmed that regular students were allowed inside the meeting — and were allowed to videotape. KnightNews.com tried to do the same thing Friday, but was kicked out and not allowed to videotape.
KnightNews.com contacted accused Sen. Jereme Pozin to ask his opinion about holding the secret meetings. Pozin didn’t know where the meetings were going on, and was informed of what was happening by KnightNews.com. He was shocked to hear the meetings were closed and hurried off the phone, apparently to demand answers.
It’s not clear whose idea it was to close the meeting, however, LJR Chairman Andreu Szempruch declined to discuss the reason and referred to a document sent by the SGA Attorney General and told KnightNews.com to see SGA adviser Christa Coffey for explanation. Coffey has told senators not to discuss the situation with media, according to multiple SGA sources.
It appears the decision to kick out media from the meeting was rushed.
KnightNews.com was given a “brief stance” on the issue of keeping the meeting secret that SGA Attorney General Nicholas Gurney wrote to Chair Szempruch. In the e-mail, Gurney made clear that a more thorough opinion would follow, but cited case law giving a very limited exception — that SGA must follow precisely to be allowed — that could possibly give them justification to close the meeting.
However, Gurney pointed out that SGA was by no way required to close it, and even seemed to suggest openness may be the best option — one at least worth considering.
“I will also say that while you may have the authority to be exempt from Sunshine Law, that doesn’t mean that you have to excercise that authority,” Gurney wrote. “You may still want to explore the possibility of keeping with open meeting practices.”
KnightNews.com was given no advance notice of SGA’s plans to close this meeting and no chance to protest the decision, or file an injunction in court to block the attempt.
It’s not yet clear what impact this decision could have on the impeachment proceedings, should someone challenge the validity of closing them either in the SGA Judicial Council or in an outside court of proper jurisdiction.
Just a few months ago, Beta Theta Pi challenged the UCF General Counsel’s opinions in court, and the university backed down and settled, after members in Beta told KnightNews.com things appeared to be going in Beta’s favor.
KnightNews.com got a comment from SGA Speaker Drew Pope in response to allegations that half the UCF SGA Senate drinks at Wackadoos.
Pope wrote: “To my knowledge, I have never witnessed a senator getting drunk during the senate recess, and neither myself or SGA condone such activities.  Being inebriated during a meeting, would be a violation of our rules and statutes at the very least.  There is more to the affidavit than just the allegations that Senator Pozin was intoxicated, and I encourage this not to be the focus of attention from the media.”



KnightNews.com got the following health alert from the Orange County Health Department regarding mosquito-borne diseases. One has been fatal in Florida recently.
See the release below for some tips:
DEATH HIGHLIGHTS IMPORTANCE OF GUARDING AGAINST MOSQUITO-BORNE DISEASES
ORLANDO – The Orange County Health Department (OCHD) again is emphasizing the importance of protection against mosquito-borne diseases after a Hillsborough County woman recently died from Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE).  The Tampa area woman is the first death in Florida attributed to EEE since 2008.
Throughout the year, OCHD works with local agencies: including Orange County Mosquito Control, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and state universities to monitor for the presence of illnesses carried by mosquitoes including West Nile virus (WNV) infections, EEE, St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), Malaria and Dengue Fever.  Central Florida has had an increase in birds and horses testing positive for EEE and WNV.  While surveillance shows an increase in these animals, no EEE, WNV, or SLE cases in humans have been identified this year and no locally-acquired cases of Malaria or Dengue Fever have been identified in Central Florida.

“It is important for people to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. There are simple measures to reduce the chances of contracting a mosquito-borne illness,” said Dr. Kevin M. Sherin, Director of the Orange County Health Department.
Orange County residents and visitors should remain diligent in protecting themselves from mosquito bites by following the “5 D’s,” which include:
Drainage – Check around your home to rid the area of standing water,                                                         where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.
DEET – When the potential exists for exposure to mosquitoes, repellents                                                containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, or N,N-diethyl-3-                                                methylbenzamide) are recommended. Picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus are                         other repellent options.
Dress – Wear clothing that covers most of your skin.
·        Dusk and Dawn – Avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are most active.
Tips on Eliminating Mosquito Breeding Sites
·        Clean out eaves, troughs, and gutters.
·        Remove old tires or drill drainage holes in those used at playgrounds.
·        Turn over or remove empty plastic pots.
·        Pick up all beverage containers and cups.
·        Check tarps on boats or other equipment that may collect water.
·        Pump out bilges on boats.
·        Replace water in birdbaths and pet or other animal feeding dishes at least once a week.
·         Change water in plant trays, including hanging plants, at least once a week.
·         Remove vegetation or obstructions in drainage ditches that prevent the flow of water.
Symptoms of mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus, St. Louis Encephalitis, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, Malaria, and Dengue Fever may include headache, fever, fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and confusion. Physicians should contact their county health department if they suspect an individual may have a mosquito-borne illness. Department of Health (DOH) laboratories provide testing services for physicians treating patients with clinical signs of mosquito-borne diseases.
Monitoring wild bird deaths can help officials track the spread of some mosquito-borne diseases. Anyone who discovers a dead bird is encouraged to report it via the internet. The bird mortality reporting system is located on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s website at: www.MyFWC.com/bird/. Citizens may also report dead birds to the Orange County Health Department by calling 407-521-2630 or the local Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission office.
