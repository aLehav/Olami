With the new possible candidates about to starting gathering together their platforms, new hopefuls may look back at what made SGA President Weston Bayes and Vice President Sydney Altfield successful in their campaign, winning the election with 64.9% of the votes in 2014. 
Bayes/Altfield ran on a platform hinged on lobbying to make a “pedestrian bridge” near UCF become a reality, along with increasing the safety of off-campus affiliated housing.
