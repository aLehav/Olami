Usually when KnightNews.com wants to get information about how much money someone makes at UCF, we are forced to pay UCF fees to retrieve the data. In some cases, we’re unable to find out how much people get paid, because UCF blacks out the student employees’ names based on how UCF has interpreted a controversial federal privacy law known as FERPA. 
But yesterday Florida Gov. Rick Scott published the pay data for all of Florida’s state university system — for free. It’s part of his “Florida Has a Right to Know” campaign. KnightNews.com has obtained the UCF pay data and sorted it from highest to lowest. Below you’ll find the data for employees making a hundred thousand dollars a year or more. On the next page, you’ll find the pay for those making less than six-figures. 
Note: Gov. Scott warned that some of these employees may actually be getting paid more than is shown here. That’s because extra money paid to UCF employees by UCF’s Foundation isn’t included in the public records Scott obtained from the universities. Hint: To get a better idea of whether someone makes more than is shown on page 1, you can check the bottom of the last page of this story to see if there are smaller amounts you could add to the salary of someone on page 1. You can also use the ctrl+f key to search a name of an employee you’re looking for.
