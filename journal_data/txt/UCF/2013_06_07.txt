Right-handed pitcher Ben Lively was drafted in the fourth round of the MLB draft by the Cincinnati Reds with pick No. 135.
Lively had an impressive junior season boasting a 2.04 ERA and 101 strikeouts which landed him a spot on the All-conference C-USA second team for the second straight season.
The pitcher was the third fouth-round pick in program history and the 18th player drafted since head coach Terry Rooney took over in 2008.
“UCF is the main reason where I am today. It got me more mature as a pitcher and a player. I give full credit to everyone there,” Lively said to UCFathletics.com.
