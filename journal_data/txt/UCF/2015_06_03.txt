Monday marked the second round of orientations for the class of 2019, and KnightNews.com was there to interview the incoming freshmen once again.
We caught up with students who told us about their favorite parts of campus, their majors, and even one future USF student was on campus for his girlfriend’s orientation.
Justin Levy had a little fun with the freshmen getting one to show off what she plans to look like after the “freshman 15”.
