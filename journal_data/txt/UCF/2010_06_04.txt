Just days after 6 boats were intercepted by the Israeli Defense Force, Israeli Government officials have confirmed to Knightnews.com another flotilla is beleived to be on the way to Gaza right now.
Knightnews.com is working closely with Israeli Government officials to monitor the situation, especially in light of the fact that several UCF students are in Israel on the Birthright trip.
Right now, Knightnews.com’s Andrew Stein is in Israel working to gather more information on the situation developing.
At this point there is no indication that any UCF students are in any danger but we will continue working closely with Israeli Government officials and our crew in Israel to update you on the developing story.
Below we have posted the latest statement from the Director General of the Israeli Minister of Foriegn Affairs, Ambassador Yossi Gal.
Statement of the Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yossi Gal
I want to once again deliver a message that has been delivered in both public and private channels to the Rachel Corie ship heading toward Gaza:
“We have no desire for a confrontation. We have no desire to board the ship. If the ship decides to sail the port of Ashdod, then we will ensure its safe arrival and will not board it.
Israel is prepared to receive the ship and to offload its contents.
After an inspection to ensure that no weapons and war materials are on board, we are prepared to deliver all of the goods to Gaza.
Representative of the people on board and relevant NGOs are welcome to accompany the goods to the crossings.
We will work with the UN and international organizations to ensure that all the goods are used for the benefit of the people of Gaza.”
