Bella Swan will face some tough choices in “Eclipse,” the third chapter of the Twilight saga which opens at midnight tonight in Orlando and across the country. 
The popular vampire series starring Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner  is packed with romance and violence. And if you go tonight, the theater will likely be packed with screaming teenage girls obsessed with seeing Jacob shirtless once again. 
Maybe UCF’s freshmen can relate most: Should they hang onto the high school sweetheart, or dump him for a new guy? 
Those of you who care about Twlight will find out tonight. The rest, won’t bother or care to know. If we had to guess, KnightNews.com’s Gabrielle Clark won’t be watching. Check out the scathing review she gave about hating New Moon the last time a Twilight movie came out.
