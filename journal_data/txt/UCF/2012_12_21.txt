Facebook will begin testing a new $1 fee that will be used to guarantee Facebook messages be sent to non-friends.
In an effort to curb spam and increase revenue, the new fee will ensure messages sent to “strangers” won’t end up in the user’s spam or de-prioritized folders, which is what Facebook says usually happens when non-friends or spammers send messages to users.
“For example, if you want to send a message to someone you heard speak at an event but are not friends with, or if you want to message someone about a job opportunity, you can use this feature to reach their Inbox,” Facebook said in an online post. “For the receiver, this test allows them to hear from people who have an important message to send them.”
Facebook will begin testing today on a small percentage of individual accounts in the United States, according to CNET news. As of now, businesses are not able to access this feature.
