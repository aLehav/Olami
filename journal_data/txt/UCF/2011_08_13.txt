Casey Anthony was ordered to serve probation by Judge Belvin Perry Friday, after her defense attorneys filed a motion to try and prevent her from serving probation outside of jail. 
An error caused Anthony to begin serving her probation for her conviction of check fraud while she was still in jail. Judge Stan Strickland had announced in court that Anthony would have to serve her probation for one year upon release from jail.
Casey Anthony Ordered to Probation
Anthony’s defense attorneys argued it would be an illegal “double jeopardy” to serve probation on the outside of jail, after having served inside jail — even if it was an error. 
Judge Perry disagreed. Now Anthony will have to come back to Orlando to report for probation later this month.
