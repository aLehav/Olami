UCFPD has determined that Wednesday night’s report of an alleged armed robbery on campus was false and will file charges against the woman for filing a false police report.
After no evidence of a robbery was found at the scene and video evidence showed discrepancies in the victim’s story, UCFPD questioned the victim further. 
UCFPD says the victim changed her story upon questioning, saying she made up the story because she did not want her parents to know that she had lost her wallet on campus.
“While we hate to cause any undue panic within our community, this incident is a reminder of the importance of always remaining vigilant about your safety,” said UCF Police Chief Richard Beary in release. “We take any crime that’s reported to us seriously, and our detectives are committed to conducting thorough investigations. They did their job well.”
UCF students were alerted of the alleged robbery via UCF Alerts and a campus-wide e-mail. 
On top of charges filed to the State Attorney, the woman will also be subject to the UCF student conduct process.
