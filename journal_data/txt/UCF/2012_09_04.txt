Looking for a cheap but worthwhile place to eat by campus? We thought so. Knightnews.com gathered a list of a few places in the UCF area that you can get a good meal for under six dollars.
 
Lazy Moon, located in the plaza on the corner of Alafaya and University, is a favorite for many students at UCF. They serve gigantic pizza slices (more than a foot long) with a selection of toppings ranging from wood-smoked bacon to artichokes, sundried tomatoes and even feta cheese. And what’s the best part about Lazy Moon? It’s cheap! Go on a Tuesday and get two cheese slices for five bucks. Go on any Thursday and get a free drink and a slice with two toppings for a total of $5.67. To see their full menu go to their website at http://www.eatdrinkandbelazy.com

For a good Asian option go to Kyoto Sushi & Grill, located in Knights Plaza right next to the UCF Arena. From 11 AM to 3:30 PM every day, Kyoto offers their chicken hibachi plate for only $5.99. That comes with a heap of hibachi chicken, choice of soup or salad, grilled vegetables, and fried or white rice. And don’t forget to try the classic Kyoto white sauce or you will have missed out on an important life experience to say the least!

Have you ever passed by Salsa2go, the small standalone building next to the reflection pond? Next time you’re there stop by for some good, cheap Mexican food on the go. They have four combo meals to choose from, all ranging from six to eight dollars. What you want to do is ask for a VIP card. This will get you any one of their combo meals for a dollar less, every time you go. So combo #1, which includes two tacos, rice and beans, and a small drink, becomes $5.05.

Sub shops are always a good choice for the hungry college student. You can get a healthy meal that fills you up for a pretty good deal; you just need to know what to ask for. The subway over by the UCF arena still offers the legendary five dollar foot long. If you have been living under a rock for the past few years, that’s one of their foot long subs for five dollars. Jimmy Johns, also right next to the arena, offers a variety of subs for $5.75 and Jersey Mike’s has some options for $5.59. Both of these places will deliver, and a 15 percent tip should not put a hole in your wallet.

Pita Pit, which is right off University Boulevard next to CB&S Bookstore, has some delicious Greek pitas for the right price. Their vegetarian pitas as well as a few of their meat pitas cost less than six dollars. However, if you sign up for their bi-weekly email list you can get some even better deals. It’s a little extra work, but well worth it if you’re watching dollars and still trying to eat out from time to time.



UCF Health Serivces will be holding an event on September 27 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m to take any unwanted prescription drugs from the public, no questions asked.
Along with the UCF Police Department, Health Services wants to rid peoples homes of potentially dangerous drugs, including the ever popular study drug, Adderall.
