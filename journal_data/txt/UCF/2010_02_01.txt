KnightNews.com crews have been going through rush and showing you the behind the scenes glimpses at fraternity rush, but now it’s your turn to show us what you think! (See our video coverage from night 2 and night1).

Which Fraternity Got the Best Spring Pledge Class at UCF?(surveys)

Now that the big choices have been made, and the pledges have picked their new homes, now you can vote on which fraternity you think had the best Spring Rush, and also feel free to leave comments below on how your chapter did, and what you thought about the night.
Until we get the official numbers from IFC, it’s hard to find out how it turned out, so here’s a place to post the info! Obviously, the poll’s not scientific, but we thought it would be a fun way to take one last look on rush, what worked, what didn’t — and also to let all the new pledges take the time to CLICK  HERE AND BECOME OUR FACEBOOK FAN (hint, hint).
If you want to report how rush turned out for you, just comment below, or e-mail news@knightnews.com, or text the information to our tipline: 407-5-TIP-UCF. We will post the official results here once they come into IFC and the UCF Greek Life office.
