An instructor at the University of Cenrtal Florida’s Rosen Campus was reinstated after being placed on administrative leave following a reference he made to “a killing spree” during one of his class sessions, the Orlando Sentinel reports.
According to the Orlando Sentienl, a university spokesman said Dr. Hyung-il Jung, a lecturer at UCF’s Rosen College of Hospitality Management, has been cleared and will teach a class this summer.
“We believe he intended the comment as a joke,” UCF spokesman Grant Heston told the Sentinel.
Jung was placed on suspension in April after making a comment about a “killing spree” during an optional review session he held for his Hospitality Industry Financial Accounting class. One student came forward to UCF and informed them of the comment, prompting the paid suspension and review of Jung.
Jung told the Orlando Sentinel last month what happened during that class session.
“What I said was: ‘This question is very difficult. It looks like you guys are being slowly suffocated by these questions. Am I on a killing spree or what?’ ” Jung told the Orlando Sentinel.
The University of Central Florida found that he apparently meant no harm with the comment, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
