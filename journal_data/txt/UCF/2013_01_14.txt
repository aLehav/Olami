UCF Computer Services and Telecommunications reported that some users using the new Windows 8 operating system may not be able to connect to UCF_WPA2.
According to the announcement posted by UCF CS&M, Windows 8 uses a method of wireless communication that is currently not compatible with the University’s wireless network.
UCF CS&M will be working with the network throughout January to try  and resolve the connection issue. If the testing goes well, UCF CS&M will be scheduling a wireless network update.
The UCF Service Desk will be fielding any questions during the service period. You can contact them at ServiceDesk@ucf.edu or 407-823-5117).



UCF Police apprehended two suspects and continue to search for a third following an armed robbery on the UCF campus.
A UCF alert email states the victim, a food delivery man from Wingzone, came back from a delivery at the UCF Towers dormitory to find one of the suspects going through his car. The victim told police that the suspects displayed a gun while robbing him.
A UCF Police officer spotted the suspects’ car and followed them until they stopped at an off-campus apartment complex. One suspect jumped out of the car and fled, while two other suspects were arrested.
The suspects have been identified as Brandon Simeon, 19, and Dontae Wallock, 19. Both suspects have armed robbery charges and are said to have no known affiliation with UCF. Wallack, however, is a student at Full Sail University, according to the Orange County police report.
