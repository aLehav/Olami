After UCF’s ugly 82-67 loss at Tulane on Thursday, the Knights have just one more opportunity to make the 2022 NCAA Tournament.
That opportunity will come in less than a week — when the American Athletic Conference Tournament opens up on March 10 at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, TX.
Where do the Knights currently stand in the AAC Tournament picture?
If the season were to end today, UCF would be the tournament’s six-seed, matched up against 11-seed South Florida in the first round.
This wouldn’t be a guaranteed win as the teams split their two games this season.
The first resulted in an embarrassing 71-56 beatdown by the Bulls in January.
The Knights seized revenge in the second matchup with their 68-49 rout of the Bulls in February.
With a win, UCF would advance to take on current three-seed Memphis, who also split with the Knights this season.
According to the Dickies Arena website, both single-game tickets and all-session ticket packages are currently on sale.
The Knights close out the regular season at Tulsa on Sunday.  Tip-off is scheduled for 2 pm
