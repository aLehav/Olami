We received two letters that the Kappa Sigma National Fraternity sent to Belinda Boston, the Director of Fraternity and Sorority Life, and the brothers of the Lambda Epsilon chapter of Kappa Sigma.

Both letters were written by Mitchell B. Wilson, the Executive Director of the National Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
The first letter explains to Ms. Boston how according to the Supreme Executive Committee of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity the UCF chapter violated the alcohol-free sanctions placed on them by their nationals. It goes on to say that the suspension will allow the current brothers to graduate and “will allow the issues which face the former chapter to dissipate.”
The second letter sent to the brothers of the UCF chapter of Kappa Sigma calls for them to “cease and desist from any further operation.” Accordingly, the brothers have to give up all ritual material and ritual equipment to Brother Paul Gamble who is President of the Lambda Epsilon Charity Fund. The chapter has up to 30 days to appeal this decision from the Supreme Executive Committee of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. We will be working to update you should the UCF chapter choose to fight this decision.
