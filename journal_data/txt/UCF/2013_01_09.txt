Think Intramural (IM) football games don’t mean anything? Think again.
UCF senior Brandon Baroody was just recently inducted into the National Flag Football Championships Hall of Fame for his success within his flag football career.

Baroody began playing pick-up football in 2007 at UCF’s Memory Mall and soon went on to become a four-time defensive All-American (2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011). Baroody was inducted into the in the hall in December making him and fellow Knight, Drew Hill, the only two Knights to be inducted into the hall for their accomplishments while playing intramural sports at UCF. 
Baroody’s football accomplishments include:
– 2009 defensive MVP.
– First player to receive All-American honors in two separate divisions (2011 co-recreational offensive All-American and 2011 men’s defensive All-American).
– 2011 co-recreational offensive MVP.
– Playing for 2009 and 2011 national championship teams (2009 men’s and 2011 co-recreational).
– 2011 national finalist (men’s).
Baroody tells UCF that he credits the competitive nature of the Recreation and Wellness Center’s Intramural Sports program to his success. 
“UCF is a great place for competition,” he said. “You get a feel for what it’s like playing in a tournament. To be good here you have to be good and organized. Once you get a taste of victory you want to keep going for more.”
Baroody is a double major at UCF, studying marketing and finance, with a minor in accounting. He tells UCF his success on the field can translate to the real world. 
“Flag football is a thinking man’s game. Seeing things as they develop and adapting to it,” he said. “Adapting during the game is what leads you to success.”
