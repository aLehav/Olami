Orlando City’s first Major League Soccer game will host New York City FC on March 8 at the Orlando Citrus Bowl.
The game will be the first in franchise history for both MLS expansion teams. Alongside newly acquired veterans, the game will feature three of the league’s most anticipated players, Orlando City’s Kaká, NYCFC’s Frank Lampard and David Villa will compete in their first-ever MLS match.
“Our fans have been waiting for this day for years and so have we,” said Orlando City Founder and President Phil Rawlins. “This is the first opportunity of many to show a national television audience why The City Beautiful is the ‘Soccer Capital of the South.’ Let’s fill the bowl!”
OCSC will also face Montreal in their home opener on Saturday, March 28 at 4 p.m. Although the opening games of the season have been announced, complete schedules will not be received until January.
The Lions will play their 2015 season in the recently debuted Orlando Citrus Bowl before taking action in the soccer club’s new stadium, which will open in March, just in time for the 2016 season. Orlando City will use”#FillTheBowl” hashtag across its social media platforms in an effort to fill every seat for their first MLS match.
“The fact that we’re going to play our first MLS game at home in front of our fans is a great present,” Orlando City coach Adrian Heath said in a statement. “Obviously, playing against New York City FC is going to be special as well… It’s a great fixture and it should be a very special night for everybody.”
The Eastern Conference rivals will kick off the game at 5:00 p.m. ET and will be televised nationally on ESPN2. Inaugural Season tickets are available at www.OrlandoCitySC.com.
