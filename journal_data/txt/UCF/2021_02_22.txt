The official Twitter account of the UCF Knights shared a graphic stating that 84% of 2021 season tickets at the Bounce House are sold out as of Friday. 
UCF said 20,079 tickets have been sold and 6,483 seats still remain of the Bounce House’s total capacity — 15,000 tickets are being allocated with 12,000 reserved for UCF students, and 3,000 set aside for the visiting team. 
Although UCF said it is too soon to know whether the Bounce House will operate at 100% capacity in 2021, season tickets are still being sold on an ongoing basis, UCF Athletics spokesman John Heisler said. 
“We have no idea — way premature to know — obviously we would love to have 100% capacity but it all depends on the COVID progress in months to come,” Heisler said in an email to Knight News on Monday. “In the meantime we are selling season tickets on an ongoing basis.”
UCF Athletics also said some of the 20,079 total includes seats reserved for recruits and other university guests, and the total does exclude suites, lodges and ADA seating.
