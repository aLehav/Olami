UPDATE: Reports from the Orange County Sheriff’s Department say 3 armed men invaded a home on Kayyaam Ave. near UCF at 8:15pm. It ended when the home invasion victim turned the tables, taking out his own weapon, and shooting the suspect.
The report states: “The victim retrieved his own handgun and challenged the suspects. There was an exchange of gun fire between one of the victims and one of the suspects. A Hispanic male suspect was shot multiple times and the other two suspects jumped from a second story window and fled the scene on foot. The injured suspect was transported to ORMC where he is listed in critical but stable condition.”
A Sterling Apartment Complex manager issued a statement saying at no time was there a shooting at the Apartment complex, as previously reported to the IFC president. The area where the shooting happened, on Khayyam Ave., is a couple blocks behind Sterling Apartments, and is home to several off campus fraternity houses. It’s been known as the “Greek Ghetto” for decades.

On Wednesday, Ann Romney drew in nearly 1,000 supporters in Central Park to tell voters about the Mitt Romney she knows.
“I love being out there talking about a person that I know, a person that I love, and I was so grateful for the debates to be able to have the opportunity for the first time for people to get an unfiltered view of who this man is,” Ann Romney said.
  Ann Romney gave a 10-minute speech and shared the story of David Oparowski, the Massachusetts 14-year-old boy who was dying of cancer in 1979 and had asked Mitt Romney to give his eulogy after the two had built a friendship. Mitt Romney knew David Oparowski and his family from church.
“That is the person that is going to be the next president of the United States,” she said.
“We know that character counts, we know, that you need to know there are going to be decisions that come across the desk of the president and that we are not going to be able to know what that person is going to decide, but you know the character of the person, and you know that they will be able to make the right decision,” she said.
Ann Romney defined character as someone with integrity, honesty and decency.
She told supporters that after the last election, she told her husband she never wanted to go through another campaign, but when Mitt Romney assured her it wasn’t too late to save this country, she responded “Go save America”.
“We’re going to get it right this time, and we’re going to make sure in November that we make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States,” she said.


The event was built on the platform “Women for Romney” but the crowd was a mix of men and women, including a non-Romney supporter.
“I’m not voting for her husband, but I thought it would be cool to see a political figure anyway,” said Miles McCreery, 18, political science major at Rollins College.
McCreery also noted that there is a generation gap in the party due to the small turn out of college students at the event.
“We thought it was fantastic, and we are hoping for the very best in November 6,” said Doug Marshburn. Marshburn and his wife, Claire drove from Deland to attend the event.
The event guest speakers were Republican women and included Cindy McCain; Kerry Healy, Massachusetts lieutenant governor when Mitt Romney was governor, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi; U.S. Rep. Sandy Adams of Ovideo; state Rep. Kelli Stargel and Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs.
