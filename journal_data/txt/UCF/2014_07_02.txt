A UCF student was arrested on suspicion of serving two juvenile females alcohol before having sexual contact with them, deputies say.
Sebastian Meleca, 23, was arrested by the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office in his apartment in Riverwind on Tuesday on charges of sexual battery of an incapacitated person and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
Meleca first enrolled at UCF in Spring 2013, and is a Health Sciences major, according to UCF spokesman Chad Binette.  
According to deputies, Meleca met two girls, ages 15 and 16, at a convenience store before taking them back to his apartment and serving them Bacardi Limón rum until they were both intoxicated.
During a recorded interview with the SCSO, one of the girls claimed to have seen Meleca engage in sexual intercourse with one of the girls while she was intoxicated. 
Deputies later arrested Meleca and was booked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility where he posted a $25,100 bond and was released.
