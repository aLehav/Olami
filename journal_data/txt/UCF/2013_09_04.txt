The Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at UCF is facing suspension through summer 2014 after being found “in-violation” of university policy for alcohol related misconduct following an unregistered social event.
The suspension was levied against the fraternity after an organizational panel hearing on August 28. The panel ruled that Alpha Tau Omega will be placed on organizational suspension until summer 2014, meaning the fraternity will not be able to use university resources or participate as an organization during this time. The fraternity would then face probation, which would end at the start of Fall 2015.

According to the police report obtained by KnightNews.com, the fraternity held a party on the night of July 28 when a UCF police officer noticed a female on Greek Park Drive holding a bottle of alcohol.
UPDATE: The Alpha Tau Omega CEO responded to the suspension of the fraternity with a press release. The CEO says that Alpha Tau Omega suspended or expelled 31 members of the fraternity due to the unregistered party, but hoped that UCF would take action against the individuals and not the entire fraternity.
