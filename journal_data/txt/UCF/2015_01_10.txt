With an expensive semester ahead, free food is something students will want to take advantage of. 
Chipotle is giving that free food opportunity to customers who come out on Monday, Jan. 26.
There is a bit of a catch, of course.
Your item must be from their new vegan choice of Sofritas(burrito, bowl, salad or order of tacos). When you purchase a Sofritas item on that date, you will receive a free entree item when you bring back your receipt between Jan. 27 and Feb. 28.
Sofritas is made of organic, non-GMO tofu from Hodo Soy that is shredded and then braised with chipotle chilies, roasted poblanos and a blend of spices, according to Chipotle’s website.
