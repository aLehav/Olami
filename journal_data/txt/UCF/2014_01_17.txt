Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian is coming to UCF tomorrow evening to talk about internet entrepreneurship and promote his new book, “Without Their Permission.”
Ohanian is on a 200 stop, 77 college, 5 month long tour and will stop at UCF on Jan. 18 at the Student Union from 7-8:30 p.m.
Ohanian will “answer top questions from the UCF subreddit, take questions from students building awesome things on the internet today, and whatever else your hearts desire,” the event listing said.
There will be a chance to network after the event, and later that night we’ll meet up at a local watering hole for a good old fashioned Reddit Meetup, the event listing said.
