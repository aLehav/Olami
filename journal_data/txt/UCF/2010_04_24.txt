Back when KnightNews.com was launched, we announced the YouReport section, where you can make videos — either serious or hilarious — and e-mail them to us for us to post on our YouReport page. 
Well, it’s been a little while since our last big YouReport hit, Flys Infesting Towers, but Sigma Chi’s Tyler Hall has sent us a another YouReport he wants to share with UCF. This one’s called: “The Ucf Pickup artist.”

Tyler, and his fraternity brother, Nick Flowers, shot and edited the spoof of the VH1 show, “The Pickup Artist,” with “a horrible camera,” he said, but promises the plot and over the top outfits will make it worth your while. 
Let us know what you think of his work, and if you want KnightNews.com to feature your funny video, or even your fraternity or sorority IM Sports game or club event, shoot us an e-mail at news@knightnews.com and we’ll add it to our YouReport section!



Alafaya Trail was temporarily shut down Saturday after a student driving home from the UCF Rec Center crashed into a man riding his bike near the Sigma Chi fraternity house.
The man, who witnesses said a homeless panhandler identified as also being homeless, was not seriously injured, but the female UCF student driver who told KnightNews.com she hit him, was extremely shaken up and in tears.
 

The driver, who did not give her name, was too upset to talk on camera, but told KnightNews.com she was driving to turn left on Alafaya from Gemini when the man came out of nowhere. The driver said the man did give an address to police, but because of witness accounts from the scene stating he is currently homeless, it’s not clear whether the address given is  an address of a family member or friend, or if he was wrongly identified as homeless by the witnesses on scene.
The man rolled onto her windshield while she continued driving for just a few seconds, until she had time to react, according to several witnesses on scene who were all UCF students.
Although all the witnesses told KnightNews.com and police the UCF student driver was not at fault, she still has to file an insurance claim for the damage done to her car, because the homeless victim apparently has no insurance.
Witnesses said the victim refused to be transported by the ambulance, and Alafaya Trail opened quickly, after it was temporarily shut down.
