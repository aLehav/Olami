UCF has released the 2019 Tailgate Concert Series schedule and announced that Smash Mouth will lead the line-up on opening night.
The California pop-rock band is scheduled to take stage on  Aug. 29 at roughly 5:30 p.m.at the IOA plaza — all performances are scheduled to begin two hours before kickoff.
Minus the final home game on Nov. 29, UCF released the majority of the series setlist.
Following the Thursday performance of Smash Mouth, Three Sheets to the Wind — a group deemed America’s #1 Tribute to Yacht Rock — will perform on Sept. 14 at 1:30 p.m.
Additional performances include Hardy, John Michael Montgomery, and Dylan Scott. These showtimes are yet to be determined.
Tailgaters can expect to find out who will perform for the final home game on Nov. 29 later into the season, UCF said in a press release.
