The Campus Activity Board(CAB) at UCF is looking for students to share ideas and opinions about the events that are hosted on campus.
On October 1 at 7:00p.m. in the Student Union Pegasus Ballroom, CAB invites out all students to meet with the head of CAB committees in an open forum.
CAB is divided into eight separate committees: Cinema, Comedy, Concerts, Fine Arts, Marketing, Speakers, Special Events and Spectacular Knights. Recently, the Campus Activity Board hosted Dan Gheesling, the winner of Big Brother 10.
CAB is offering accommodations for students which can be reached at cabassist@ucf.edu.
