After the biggest win in UCF football history, hundreds of fans waited outside the Wayne Densch Sports Center to welcome the Knights back home.
UCF defeated No. 6 Baylor 52-42 in the Fiesta Bowl on Wednesday, even though the Baylor Bears were favored by 17 points the Knights did not trail once the entire game. Thanks in part to four total touchdowns by Blake Bortles and three rushing touchdowns by Storm Johnson, the Knights secured their first BCS-bowl win in school history.
Fans gathered on UCF campus holding signs urging quarterback Blake Bortles to stay “one more year”. O’Leary said that he will meet with Bortles and his family on Jan. 3 to discuss his NFL possibilities. For now, Bortles and O’Leary just want to relish in the historic win for such a young program.
