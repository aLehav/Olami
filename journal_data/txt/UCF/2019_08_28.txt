Comedian Pete Davidson abruptly stopped his stand-up set over the use of cellphones while on stage Monday evening during Comedy Knight at Addition Financial Arena.
Kia Del Solar Patino, a junior international and global studies major, said Davidson seemed to get upset with an individual who was recording during his performance. Patino said there were no evident messages telling attendees that recording the event was prohibited.
“There were absolutely no signs or warnings on the Facebook event page or the ads promoting the event,” Patino said.
The “Saturday Night Live” cast member’s explicative-filled tirade can be heard video shared on YouTube.
“If you film everything but not enjoy the show for f****** an hour, then like, I don’t gotta be here for that. You can just give them their money back because I don’t give a f***,” Davidson said.
The Campus Activities Board did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication.
“So like, whenever somebody else comes to your f****** town and wants to perform and is exhausted and flies all the way to the middle of f****** nowhere to do jokes for you, you little privileged a*******, don’t f****** ruin the show for people who actually want to be here,” Davidson said.
According to Addition Financial Arena’s website, cameras or recording devices of any kind are not permitted inside the arena but the rule is subject to change on an event-by-event basis when photography is allowed.
The response Davidson initially received included some cheers, which he quickly shot down because he said those individuals who were cheering were also the ones on their phones.
“Don’t you want adults to respect us? Don’t you want your parents to, like, be proud of you? You know how f****** embarrassing it is to be our age and walk out and knows everybody thinks you’re a fucking idiot? Grow the fuck up,” the 25-year-old comedian said. “That’s why the world is gonna end in 25 years, because you’re all f****** retarded.”
I had a talk with Britt last night regarding Pete Davidson and the hurtful words he used. This is unacceptable. @UCF welcomed Britt as a student several years ago. Although brief, it changed her life. The r-word is not okay. @NDSS @GDSFoundation #petedavidsonucf #petedavidson pic.twitter.com/RC71jC8cgE

Mark Schlueb, director of strategic communications at UCF, said it is upsetting Davidson’s performance diminished the value of the university’s efforts to welcome students to campus.
“Mr. Davidson’s abusive language, particularly his use of a derogatory slur, is contrary to the University of Central Florida’s values of inclusion and respect for all,” Schlueb said in an email on Tuesday. “It’s disappointing that his rant spoiled an event that was meant to welcome students back for the fall semester.”
Patino said Davidson took a minute or two to collect himself before trying to continue his stand-up set but said the atmosphere was unsettling and awkward.
Pegasus Palooza — UCF’s official welcome week held during the first week of each fall semester — is organized for new and returning UCF students to become more familiar and connected with the campus, according to its website. Monday’s Comedy Knight was the first of a weeklong series of events.
Davidson, who was announced as the Pegasus Palooza Comedy Knight headliner on Aug. 2, was not the first comedian scheduled to headline the annual event.

The Campus Activities Board tweeted on Aug. 1 that Colin Jost, “Saturday Night Live” cast member and the comedian originally headlining the event, could no longer attend due to film scheduling conflicts.

Comedy Knight — an event hosted by the Campus Activities Board and funded through the Activity & Service Fees, which are included in the cost of UCF’s tuition — was free to students with a valid UCF ID, and $20 for general admission tickets.
Pretty bummed to have paid $60 plus $41 in fees to see Pete Davidson rage on kids for having phones out. FYI, there were ZERO notices about phones anywhere. And the girl who introduced the show never mentioned it. @UCF_CAB should refund those of us who paid for this.

The Activity & Service Fee is currently $11.67 per credit hour, according to the Activity & Service Fee Business Office’s website.



Now a Category 1 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center has projected Hurricane Dorian to strengthen into a Category 3 before making landfall in Florida, prompting Florida Governor Ron Desantis to declare a state of emergency.
“Today, I am declaring a state of emergency to ensure Florida is fully prepared for Hurricane Dorian,” said Governor DeSantis. “Every Florida resident should have seven days of supplies, including food, water, and medicine, and should have a plan in case of disaster.”
As Hurricane #Dorian approaches, I’ve declared a state of emergency to ensure local governments and emergency management agencies have ample time, resources and flexibility to get prepared. Please continue to follow local reports and @FLSERT for updates. https://t.co/FyQM6wd8er

The latest projections also anticipate UCF to be near the center of its crosshairs by late Sunday or early Monday.
In a Tuesday press release, UCF announced that the Office of Emergency Management is “actively monitoring” the hurricane and readying the university to “respond to and recover from emergencies.”
UCF Police Chief Carl Metzger issued a statement Wednesday urging students to “prioritize” their personal safety and to prepare, rather than panic.

UCF has yet to announce any sort of schedule changes due to the storm.
As of 5 p.m., Hurricane Dorian is holding a maximum sustained wind speed of 80 m.p.h and is traveling at 14 m.p.h. over Puerto Rico, according to the NHC.
