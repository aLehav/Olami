Students looking to have food delivered will have another option with the newly opened “Z-Diner” at UCF.
Open from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m., Z-Diner offers free delivery for any food order over $6. The company was started by Zach Zelner in his Tallahassee apartment around two years ago, and has since expanded to Tampa and now Orlando with Z-Diner.

Zelner bought out Midnight Munchies and worked out a deal with Knight’s Pub to use their kitchen to run Z-Diner out of. He turned to his best friend, Todd Stephenson, to manage the restaurant and other UCF students to work there.
Z-Diner is also the sister company of Z-Baked, which delivers sweet treats in the UCF area.
