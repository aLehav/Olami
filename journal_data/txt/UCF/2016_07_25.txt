The Democratic party may not be as united as they had hoped going into day one of the Democratic National Convention.
Hundreds of Bernie Sanders supporters began protesting against Hillary Clinton hours before the kick off of the Convention.
Protestors walked through the streets of downtown Philadelphia shouting “hey, hey, ho, ho, HRC has got to go!” 
These protests are coming after an email scandal has landed DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other DNC officials in hot water. 
One Bernie supporter told Knight News that he will not be backing Hillary Clinton no matter the convention’s outcome.
Sen. Sanders had already endorsed Hillary Clinton as the nominee prior to the scandal, and is expected to speak today on the opening day of the convention.
Stay tuned with Knight News for continued coverage of the DNC.



The release of twenty-thousand supposed incriminating Democratic National Convention administrative emails by WikiLeaks has led to the resignation of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman.
The chairwoman planned to lead in the four day event although will step back from the spotlight.
Ahead of the first night of the convention, attendees think back to Ted Cruz’s speech at the Republican National Convention, where the former presidential nominee denied Trump an endorsement .
Unclear whether Sanders will go against his formal endorsement for Clinton, a speech has been scheduled nonetheless. ‘Gavel In’ will take place at 4:30 p.m. at the Philadelphia Convention Center and continue with appearances by Clinton, Sanders, Michelle Obama, and more.
Knight News will provide updates on the speakers and a photo gallery of the convention meeting itself.
