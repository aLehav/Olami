One man’s tribute to his brother who “was killed in action” overseas is hitting home with college students this Memorial Day, according to a UCF Stagger Inn Facebook post.
“A man came in today by himself and ordered two beers. I cracked both open and asked him if he was waiting for someone but he said no,” Jess Paulauskas, a Stagger Inn bartender, said on her own Facebook page.
Stagger Inn posted the story on its Facebook page, with this caption: “God Bless America and thank you to our brave men and women. We salute you.”
As the man was about to close out his tab, Paulauskas said he ordered one last shot of alcohol. She said she told the man that this shot was on her and for him to have a happy Memorial Day.
“He looked at me with sad eyes and told me it wouldn’t be a happy one this year since he just lost his brother overseas,” said Paulauskas. “He then asked me to keep the beer that he hadn’t touched and the seat flipped up for the rest of the night in honor of his brother.”
After the man had left, other people were asking why the beer was there along with the flipped up seat, and as they became more aware of what happened earlier that day, people began to order “additional beers to add to the original one in salute of the fallen soldier,” according to Stagger Inn.
The story is getting viral attention from Paulauskas’ Facebook page. Over 250 people have shared the story so far.
