Update: Orlando Business Journal confirms Waterford Lakes deal.
After the success of Wahlburgers in downtown Orlando, a closer taste of the burger joint is spreading to Waterford Lakes, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
Franchisee Gina Buell told the Sentinel Wahlburgers is negotiating to open a 6,700-square-foot restaurant.
“Buell expects some of the famous Walhberg brothers to appear at the opening, just as Mark and Paul did when the restaurant opened downtown,” the Sentinel reported.
A lease has not been signed but Buell said she expects the restaurant will open in place of Amigo’s Tex-Mex at 749 N. Alafaya Trail, according to the Sentinel.
The casual burger chain was founded by famous brothers Mark and Donnie Wahlberg, along with their chef brother Paul Wahlberg. A&E also premiered the reality series Wahlburgers for an inside look at the restaurant.
The Waterford Lakes location is expected to have a full bar and be over 700 square feet bigger than the downtown location, according to the Sentinel.
An opening date has not been set.
