As the controversial Kilbride administration fades into UCF SGA history, KnightNews.com has already learned who Kilbride’s successor, Matthew McCann, has picked to lead his cabinet.
CHIEF OF STAFF
Kyle Simpson, a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity who has served as chairman of President Hitt’s Leadership Council, was selected as the chief of staff for the McCann/Brock administration. He replaced Joey Femia, also a member of Beta Theta Pi. We’re working to find out Simpson’s major. 
COMPTROLLER
E. Joshua Miller, the current Pro Tempore of the SGA Senate, previous Activity & Service Fee chairman and member of AEPI, has been selected as McCann’s comptroller. Miller gained notoriety for bringing more transparency to SGA by publicly posting minutes of $17 million A&SF budget meetings online — without first blacking out SGA officials’ names — even though doing so appears to violate UCF Associate General Counsel Youndy Cook’s apparent interpretation of FERPA, because Cook required the names to be redacted during the previous year. Miller also live streamed video and audio records of of the A&SF meetings online.
DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS
Amanda Newby, a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma who has served as Panhellenic President, was selected as Director of Communications for the McCann/Brock administration. This position was previously held by Kristin Harris, who took over after Matt Smith, an Alpha Epsilon Pi, became among the first to resign from the Kilbride administration following several of Kilbride’s controversial decisions in office. Kayla Torpey, a member of Pi Beta Phi, served as Kilbride’s Public Relations specialist. KnightNews.com mistakenly identified Harris as a member of Pi Phi in an earlier version of this story. 
ATTORNEY GENERAL
Reggie Paros, a member of Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity, gained notoriety for issuing an unprecedented AG opinion to invalidate an SGA senate committee’s decision to move an impeachment affidavit filed against Kilbride forward because the meeting allegedly started three minutes outside the 30 minute window allowed by statutes. SGA could not point to one instance where that rule had ever been enforced prior to Kilbride having the impeachment charges filed against him. Paros took over the AG spot after Nicholas Gurney resigned to run for SGA president.
DIRECTOR OF CAMPUS LIFE
Chris Pombonyo was selected as McCann’s Director of Camus life. Pombonyo previously served as Director of Spectacular Knights, which puts on Miss UCF and Mr. UCF. He replaces Amanda Newby. 
DIRECTOR OF STUDENT AFFAIRS
Michael Davis, a member of Sigma Pi fraternity, was selected as McCann’s Director of Student Affairs. He replaces Latoya Jackson.
DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS
Lauren Evans was selected as Director of Governmental Affairs. She replaces Andreu Szempruch, a member of Beta. The Governmental Affairs Unit could be key to stopping the UCF administration from getting permission from the state to eventually destroy the arboretum in the name of expansion. KnightNews.com is working to research more about Evans’ record. 
KnightNews.com has learned the following individuals were selected to join the cabinet in support staff roles:
– Caitie Shields: Facilities and Projects Coordinator
– Santiago Ossa: Student Outreach Coordinator
– Arielle Bardzell: Athletic and Traditions Coordinator
– Julian Belilty: Sustainability Specialist
– April Brown: Internal Marketing Coordinator
– Michelle Venezia: External Marketing Coordinator
– Ashley Tinstman: Public Relations Coordinator
– Steve Della-Valentina: Web Coordinator
– Trevor Persued: Diversity Initiatives Coordinator
– Alex Bissel: Safety and Transportation Specialist
– Zach McCaffrey: Legislative Affairs Coordinator
– Cynthia Florentino: Community Affairs Specialist
We’re working to learn and post any remaining positions which have been selected. Keep refreshing or checking back for updates.
All of these cabinet officials still have to be confirmed by a two-thirds vote of the SGA senate before becoming official. 



If you’re moving out of your UCF apartment, and aren’t able to bring all your stuff with you, Phi Delta Theta has been happy to take it off your hands to try and sell it during its first end of the semester yard sale.
The yard sale is happening all day Saturday across from UCF at the fraternity house located behind Sterling Central Apartments on Khayyam Avenue next to the new Lambda Chi house.
Phi Delt Yard Sale for ALS
The proceeds from the yard sale will benefit ALS research, to help combat the illness often referred to as “Lou Gehrig’s Disease.”
Lou Gehrig is an alumnus of Phi Delt, so that is why the fraternity supports that cause for its philanthropy.
The yard sale should go until 4 p.m. today, according to Facebook postings about it, and is being touted as a good way to clean out your closet for a good cause, and to pick up some used goods for a good price.
“I want to thank all the fraternities and sororities who donate,” Phi Delt Community Service Chair Scott Johnson said. “This is a fun and easy way to raise money for ALS … All items that go unsold will be donated to the Russell Home — an orphanage for atypical children.”
