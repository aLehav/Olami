For the first time in program history, the Knights are officially headed to a BCS bowl.
On Sunday, it was announced that the UCF Knights will play in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, AZ on Jan. 1 at 8:30 p.m. EST. The Fiesta Bowl features the Big 12 Champion versus a BCS qualified at-large opponent.
No. 15 UCF (11-1,8-0) qualified for the BCS spot after winning the American Athletic Conference by going undefeated in conference play, which still has an automatic qualifying bid remaining from the old Big East. The Knights will have their work cut out for them against the No.6 Baylor Bears (11-1,8-1) who are fresh off of a 30-10 win against Texas to secure the Big 12 title. Baylor is currently first in the nation in averaging 53.3 points per game and has the fifth overall passing offense in the nation.
