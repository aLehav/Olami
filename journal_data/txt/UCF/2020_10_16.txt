UCF plans to move to fully remote learning after its rescheduled spring break and offer more in-person classes this spring, the university said in an email obtained by Knight News.
UCF interim Provost Michael Johnson said in an email sent to faculty and staff on Friday that the university now knows more about how its policies, testing, tracing and other measures protect the community. 
“To help limit the spread of COVID-19, spring break will be rescheduled to a week (to be determined soon) later in the semester,” Johnson said. “We will move to entirely remote instruction following that week, although residence halls and campus offices will remain open.” 
Johnson said in the email that if public health conditions require a change, the university is ready to pivot to more remote teaching at any time. 
“Our spring approach will again follow our COVID-19 policies, including requiring face masks, conducting daily cleaning and nightly sanitizing of classrooms, and enforcing physical distancing,” Johnson said. “We will not be increasing the density of seating in our classrooms.”
Johnson said that UCF will continue to emphasize the importance of abiding by COVID-19 protocols, but the university has seen no spread of the virus resulting from classrooms. 
Earlier this semester, UCF placed all students in an in-person class under quarantine after an individual in the class tested positive.
