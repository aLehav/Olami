The UCF O-teamers welcomed hundreds of new Knights as they attended their first day as a student at orientation.
Orientations started May 21 and will continue until the end of the summer. UCF Orientation aims to help students and their parents become more familiar with the university, navigate their way around campus, and choose future classes.
