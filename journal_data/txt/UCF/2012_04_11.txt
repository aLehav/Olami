The Washington Post reports that Florida special prosecutor Angela Corey will announce the prosecution as early as Wednesday afternoon although it is not clear on whatexactly George Zimmerman will be charged for.
The prolonged arrest of Zimmerman has caused a social uproar around the nation, with African-American Civil Rights leaders like Rev.Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to make trips to Sanford to advocate for Zimmerman’s arrest.
Groups like the New Black Panthers have placed a 10,000 dollar bounty for Zimmerman, and his lawyers have said that Zimmerman has been receiving death threats.
If the announcement were to be on Wednesday, this would be just a day after Zimmerman’s lawyers withdrew their representation of him due to the inability to contact him.
