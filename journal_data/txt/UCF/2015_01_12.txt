Knight’s Grub is holding its soft opening tonight inside of Next Door Bar(connected to Knight’s Pub) just in time for the College Football Playoff championship between No. 2 Oregon and No. 4 Ohio State.
Knight’s Pub/Next Door Bar will be opening earlier than usual at 7:30 p.m. to broadcast live game coverage, while Knight’s Grub will be serving up various food items such as pork sliders and beef tacos on its first night. The opening of Knight’s Grub adds to the bar’s plans to add a second floor to the already existing deck.
After watching No. 4 Ohio State take down No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 Oregon shatter No. 3 Florida State on New Year’s Day, the two teams will face off in the first ever College Football Playoff championship tonight on ESPN at 8:30 p.m. ET in Arlington, Texas at AT&T Stadium.
Both teams have had approximately two weeks to prepare for the first ever College Football Playoff championship game. The Oregon Ducks stand as 6.5- point favorites over the Ohio State Buckeyes. Since Urban Meyer took over the coaching reigns at Ohio State, he and the Buckeyes are 5-0 when predicted as the underdog.
The game pits two very different starting quarterbacks against each other. 
Marcus Mariota, quarterback of the Oregon Ducks, is looking to add to his historic season after already winning the annual Heisman Trophy. Cardale Jones, quarterback for the Buckeyes, is just making his third career start at Ohio State University. 
Despite Jones’ lack of experience as a starter, he will be looking to lead the Buckeyes to their first national championship since 2002 when the Buckeyes beat the Miami Hurricanes 31-24 in double overtime. 
Oregon is in the hunt for their first national championship having only been to the national championship one time in 2011, where they lost to the University of Auburn 22-19.
