Mandatory and voluntary evacuations for nearby homeowners were enforced as the fire claimed campsites and other buildings.
The University of Central Florida Department of Security and Emergency Management has cautioned students on campus in an exceptionally dry season for the region and the state.
Low humidity and high winds have let to ideal conditions for wildfires, DSEM Director Jeff Morgan said to students and faculty.
“Landscape & Natural Resources, in collaboration with the Department of Security and Emergency Management, regularly monitors local conditions and takes preventative measures to mitigate fires in the natural areas of campus,” Morgan said.
“The UCF team includes trained professionals who are well equipped and experienced in dealing with wildfires and who work closely with state fire and forestry officials. As UCF continues to take precautions, we encourage you to stay aware of local road conditions and to not take chances in the event a fire is impacting your area.”
As with all emergencies on campus, students and faculty will be notified of an imminent danger through the UCF Alert system.
