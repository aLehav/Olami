A small stovetop fire caused Â a total of four fire engines, two ambulances, and UCFPD to respond. Although there were no aesthetic damages done to the outside of the Knights Circle building, one resident was treated for chest pains.
The fire happened at roughly 4:00pm on Thursday afternoon. When Knightnews.com arrived at the scene someone from inside the building yelled for a paramedic. There were no visible flames from outside and we received word that it was just a stove fire caused from a pot on the stove.
The fire may have done minor damage inside as you can see from the pictures below that some furniture was outside.
