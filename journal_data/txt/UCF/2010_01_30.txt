UCF graduate Rachael Todd already won the Miss Florida crown. Tonight, she’s going for the ultimate beauty queen prize: The Miss America Title. 
Todd will compete against the other women representing their states for the Miss America crown in Las Vegas Saturday night. 
But if she wins, she won’t make history — UCF grad Ericka Dunlap became the first Knight to win the Miss America crown back in 2004. 
There is a watch party at Brooklyn Pizza in Farrell Commons tonight. 
Todd hopes to continue her education if she wins. See a video interview by UCF TV below:
