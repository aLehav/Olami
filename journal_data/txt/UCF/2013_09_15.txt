UPDATE UCF earned 33 votes in the coaches poll, giving the Knights an unofficial rank of 31. 
The University of Central Florida has earned some votes in the AP top 25 college football rankings after defeating Penn State Saturday.
The Knights received 25 votes, meaning UCF is unofficially ranked at number 28 in the country.
UCF has the opportunity to gain more votes further down the road with games against South Carolina and Louisville.

“We hope you’re going to see the Knights make history,” said UCF President John C. Hitt to a small but passionate crowd at the Alumni tailgate.
And that was exactly what they did.
The 34-31 win against Penn State marks the first win for UCF against a Big Ten opponent and the first time they’ve started off a season 3-0 since 1988.

After the game, Head Coach George O’Leary was adamant in saying that this is the biggest Knight’s victory in his ten year tenure–even bigger than his bowl victory against SEC powerhouse Georgia.
Why?
“Because it happened today,” O’Leary said in the press conference after the game.
Blake Bortles passed for 288 yards, three touchdowns, and improved his draft stock tremendously in an extremely well managed game by the redshirt junior.
The biggest worry for the Knights coming into the game was their offensive line, but the line seemed to hold up well against a Penn State defense that was averaging 66 rush yards a game.
The Knights hopped on a plane back to Orlando not even an hour after the game finished. Wide Receiver JJ Worton called this game a business trip. The business was done, and now the Knights have their sights set on South Carolina as they head into the bye week.[myrelposts-related title=”See More UCF vs. PSU Coverage:“]
