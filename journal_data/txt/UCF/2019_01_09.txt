After it was announced on Wednesday that Jalen Hurts entered his name into the NCAA’s transfer portal, there has been a lot of buzz around what school will score the former Alabama QB.
According to the BetDSI Sportsbook, UCF currently has the 7th best odds among other schools like Florida State, the University of Florida, Washington State and Texas A&M.
Hurts’s decision to transfer wasn’t a big of a surprise after he lost his starting position to the current Alabama QB, Tua Tagovailoa, following the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship.
The Houston Cougars currently have the best odds of acquiring the highly-pursued QB, most likely due to the fact that Hurts is from Houston. But some college football fans believe he should choose another route.
“If I was Hurts, I would look at WSU,” UCF alumnus Rob Morris commented in a UCF Facebook group. “They made an ECU QB an NFL draft pick in one year.”
But after UCF lost its star QB, McKenzie Milton, to a brutal knee injury against USF on Thanksgiving Day, there is talk that Hurts may choose to head to Central Florida as Milton recovers.
“If Hurts wants to increase his draft stock by being exposed to high-powered offense and fluffing his numbers he should have UCF toward the top of his list,” commented UCF alumnus Craig Anderson.
UCF’s current odds stand at +1500.
This is a developing story. Stay tuned for updates on Hurts’s transfer decision.
