ESPN just broke news that University of Florida head football coach Urban Meyer is stepping down from the Florida Gators. 
UF Coach Urban Meyer released this statement to the media.
“I have given my heart and soul to coaching college football and mentoring young men for the last 24-plus years and I have dedicated most of my waking moments the last five years to the Gator football program,” Meyer wrote. “I have ignored my health for years, but recent developments have forced me to re-evaluate my priorities of faith and family.
“After consulting with my family, [Florida president Bernie] Machen, [athletic director] Jeremy Foley and my doctors, I believe it is in my best interest to step aside and focus on my health and family.”
The Gators are set to play in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day. This would presumably be Meyer’s final game at UF.
