On Wednesday, UCF unveiled a massive $69.4 million dollar renovation plan to their athletics facilities that leaves little question of UCF’s commitment to its athletic future.
The renovations include an open-air tiki bar, a $15 million dollar football operations building, Jay Bergman Field upgrades, tennis court expansion, and a student-athlete leadership center. Many other facility upgrades such as sidewalks and video boards will also be added.
Most of the renovations, such as the most expensive of adding 10,000 seats to the east side of BrightHouse Networks Stadium at a cost of $20 million dollars, is still in its premature stages with no set start date or contractor.
Currently, the projects with set contractors and start dates include the Jay Bergman field renovations which are set to start in July 2013 and be completed by February 2014. The Wayne Densch Center for Student Athlete Leadership will begin construction in December 2013 and conclude in September 2014 at a cost of $6.5 million dollars. The open-air tiki bar also has the green light to begin construction in January 2014 and will be completed by August 2014 at a cost of $1.4 million dollars.
David Hensen, the Associate Athletic Director, told UCFSports.com that the current plan is not completely finalized.
“It changes, sometimes weekly. We make adjustments. This is not set in stone. This is a plan that we feel is necessary to move ahead.” Hensen said.
