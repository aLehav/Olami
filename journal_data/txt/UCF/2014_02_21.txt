On Friday, Blake Bortles addressed the media and made it clear that his goal is to be the top quarterback in this year’s NFL Draft.
Bortles is considered one of the top quarterback prospects along with Texas A&M’s Johnny Manziel and Louisville’s Teddy Bridgewater. Some draft boards have Bortles going No. 1 to the Texans, some do not have him going in the top 5. However, none of the other top quarterback prospects have the connections with the Texans like Bortles does.
“I don’t think I’ll know until May 8 but I’ll do everything I can and unturn every stone to make sure that when I’m sitting there on draft day I’m not looking back saying I wish I would have done this, I wish I would have done that. I’ll have done everything in my power to be the best that I can be by that day,” Bortles said at the NFL Scouting Combine.
During Bill O’Brien’s press conference at the NFL Scouting Combine he showed his intrigue with the former UCF quarterback. Bortles and the Knights beat O’Brien’s Penn State Nittany Lions at home in 2013 when he was the head coach.
“They beat us and I thought he threw the ball well that night. Obviously, I have a connection with George O’Leary and their coaching staff thinks very highly of him there,” O’Brien said of Bortles.
Even though O’Brien is impressed with Bortles, he admits that the Texan’s coaching staff haven’t made any serious decisions on who they will be taking No. 1 overall in May’s draft.
“I’ve watched a lot of exciting players, players with different skill sets, players that have a lot of really good skills,” O’Brien said.
