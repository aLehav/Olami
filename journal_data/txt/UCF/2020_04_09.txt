UCF announced Wednesday that eligible students will receive prorated refunds based on the unused portion of their dining membership for the spring semester. 
The refunds for dining memberships — which will also include unused dining dollars — will be posted in eligible students’ accounts and will be shown in their myUCF account, but any balance due to the university will be paid before the refund is dispersed. 
This is developing. Check back for updates.
