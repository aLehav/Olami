After losing to Tulane in the team’s final AAC championship game, the UCF football team is set to go bowling in Annapolis Maryland later this month in the Military Bowl for the first time in program history. 
After missing out the program’s a third NY6 bowl matchup, the Knights are set to take on Atlantic Coast Conference opponent Duke at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium on Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2022 at 2 p.m. The game will be broadcast nationally on ESPN. 
The postseason matchup will mark the program’s seventh consecutive bowl appearance and 10th in the past 11 seasons. The Military bowl will benefit the USO and Patriot Point which is the Military Bowl Foundations retreat for ill and wounded service members along with their families and caregivers. 
The bowl game will also mark the first time the Knights will face Duke on the football field in program history and second time the UCF has faced a current ACC opponent in a bowl game after the Knights lost to NC State in the 2014 St. Petersburg Bowl. 
With the matchup, UCF Head Coach Gus Malzahn keeps his record perfect qualifying for bowl games in all 11 games he has been head coach.  
Fans will have to wait and see if the team can finish the 2022 campaign on a positive note after experiencing an up-and-down season that included two wins over top 25 teams, along with moments of questionable play calling and inconsistencies to produce on offense consistently from week to week. 
The team will have a tougher time on the offensive side of the ball as QB Mikey Keene and consistent go-to receiver Ryan O’Keefe will no longer be with the team as they both have decided to enter the transfer portal.
