Last night, UCF’s very own, Jacob Harris, accomplished something that every football player has dreamt of doing.
Win a super bowl.
With the Los Angeles Rams’ stunning 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, Harris became the 12th UCF football alumnus to win a Super Bowl ring.
Harris did not get to suit up for the playoffs, however, as the Rams were forced to place him on the Injured Reserve list after the tight end suffered a torn ACL and MCL while covering a punt return vs. the Tennessee Titans on Nov. 8.
Harris was primarily used on special teams, but Rams head coach Sean McVay hinted that he was planning to potentially get the former Knight more involved in his game plan.
“It’s a bummer.  I hate that for Jacob, and you were hoping to kind of get him a little bit more involved,” McVay said following the injury.
Harris appeared in nine games this season, but did not record any significant stats.
While playing for UCF, Harris appeared in every game during his three seasons of eligibility.
His most productive year came during his 2020 senior season, where he finished third on the team in both receptions (30) and reception yards (539).  Harris led the team with 18 yards per reception, adding eight touchdowns.
What a year full of opportunity and blessings! World Champs! Thank you God! https://t.co/qmgquu3iV4
