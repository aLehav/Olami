UCF alum Sean Barakett, A.K.A “UCF problems” on Twitter, was kicked out of this past Friday’s home football game by Kissimmee Police working the stands — and was threatened to be charged with trespassing if he returned — after refusing to sit during the game.  
According to The University of Central Florida Police Department, Barakett who has been known for being a “hype man” at past football games was asked to leave Sept. 9 home matchup against Louisville after not sitting down for the entirety of the game.  
Official statement:Yea, I was told to sit down, didn’t realize it would result in a fucking trespass Was just trying to hype everyone up. We kind of needed it lolDidn’t mean to rub anyone the wrong way. I love y’all. Go Knights
According to the police report, Barakett was seen “hugging random people and running back and forth” throughout the game.  
Barakett was told he would be charged for trespassing if he decided to reenter FBC Mortgage stadium at any point during the remainder of the game.  
Barakett took to his social media to address the issue.  
“Yea, I was to sit down, didn’t realize it would result in a fucking trespass,” Barakett said. “Was just trying to hype everyone up. We kind of needed it lol. Didn’t mean to rub anyone the wrong way. I love ya’ll. Go Knights.”  
Barakett proceeded to respond to fans on his social media who saw the UCF donor being escorted out of the game.  
I just got detained in the stadium for absolutely no reason And trespassed. I did nothing wrong. Thanks @UCFPolice

The removal was just for one game as Barakett will be able to reenter FBC Mortgage stadium for the Knight’s next home game against Georgia Tech on Saturday Sept. 24.
