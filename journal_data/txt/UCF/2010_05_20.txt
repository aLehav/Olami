One of UCF’s most famous alumni is making headlines for landing a job as a professional football player, but this latest job is drawing disgrace for Daunte Culpepper for several reasons.
ESPN’s Adam Schefter has learned Culpepper is accepting a job playing for the UFL Sacramento Mountain Lions, after failing to land even a measly third-string position in the NFL after leaving the Detroit Lions where the quarterback played second fiddle to No. 1 overall draft pick Matthew Stafford of the Georgia Bulldogs.
Culpepper has been blasted in national media coverage of his fall.
“We’re talking about a two-time All-Pro, a three-time Pro Bowler and a guy who once graced the cover of Madden.
Now he’s on a team that’s also accepting players from open tryouts,” Yahoo News reported.
The Orlando Sentinel, which covered Culpepper’s meteoric rise at UCF, is also blasting Culpepper for choosing to play for a California team, instead of returning back home to the city that gave him his start and playing for the Florida Tuskers.

“Daunte Culpepper has seemingly cut all ties with the city that championed its star quarterback,” Sentinel columnist Shannon J. Owens wrote. “He rarely makes public appearances at home, you don’t here about any Culpepper camps or community projects.”
