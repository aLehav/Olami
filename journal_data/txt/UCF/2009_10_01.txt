KnightNews.com just received this e-mailed statement from Grant Heston of UCF’s News & Information Department:
“We value the scholarship, service and enthusiasm of our Greek community, and in light of the upcoming Family Weekend, UCF has lifted the voluntary suspension of new member activities. Fraternities have been reminded of conduct rules, and UCF will monitor the situation and revisit this decision if needed.
We continue to conduct a thorough, timely and fair review of the anonymous allegation.”
Heston also said UCF’s fraternity review is ongoing. Timely updates will be provided pending developments in the review process.



KnightNews.com’s cameras were rolling during a public hearing where the SGA Elections Commission played audio tape evidence of SGA Sen. Will Lusk’s conversation with an influential College Republican about the possibility of Unite Ticket members paying UCF’s College Republicans more than $500 in membership fees during a conversation about securing the club’s endorsement.
The conversation Lusk had was with CJ Cooper, who said she recorded the conversation after Lusk was told he was being recorded.
The SGA Elections Commission found Lusk in violation of its bribery statutes, and disqualified him from the race with a major violation. Lusk has so far refused to comment to us regarding whether he’ll appeal, apologize, or just move on.

So what do you think?
Is this a smoking gun that proves Lusk committed bribery, or should Lusk fight this conviction to the SGA Judicial Council on appeal?
