 The University of Central Florida has suspended three fraternities after the violent tailgate incident that took place at this past weekend’s football game. 
Knight News reached out to Chad Binette the Assistant Vice President of Communications at UCF and asked if UCF has identified the Fraternities involved. Binette responded by saying that, “UCF issued interim suspensions to Phi Beta Sigma, Alpha Phi Alpha, and Omega Psi Phi.”  
Binette did not explain any details about the involvement of the three fraternities.
This comes after a video of a massive fight breaking out of a large crowd of people shoving and punches being thrown at each other hit social media. 
An original video of the altercation that took place in the homecoming tailgate before the UCF/Tulane football game at one point had over 4.5 million views on TikTok. According to @lissaraaye, who posted the video said, “Tiktok deleted it so posting it on here”. 
UCF has not disclosed how long the suspensions issued to the fraternities will last. 
Knight News will keep following this story and keep you updated.
