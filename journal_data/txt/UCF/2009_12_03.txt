UCF’s newly crowned homecoming King and Queen are hosting a moving night to spread holiday cheer and help local kids in the community.
The event, which takes place at 7 p.m. tonight at 12115 Mendel Drive, is called “Movie Night In The Ghetto,” according to a facebook event.
The ghetto is a nickname UCF Greeks have given to an area of old, rundown apartments across from campus, sometimes known for crime, where many fraternities have set up their houses because UCF hasn’t built sufficient housing on campus for all Greek organizations yet.
Homecoming King and newly elected IFC President Kyle Schumacher has erected a huge screen to project the movie “Home Alone” on the side of his house at the above address.
Participants are asked to bring a toy to donate to needy families.
“Toys will be dropped off at a local elementary school the following morning to help those families who can’t afford toys for their little ones,” says the facebook event, which lists Schumacher and Homecoming Queen Caitlyn McManus as administrators.
The organizers relied on Facebook and word of mouth to host the event, instead of spending student fees to advertise, rent a screen and set it all up.
“No bureaucracy, No pr stunts, just some holiday cheer,” the facebook group, noticed today by KnightNews.com staff, says.
Organizers reminds those attending to bring blankets, hot chocolate, girlfriends/boyfriends — and a toy to donate.
