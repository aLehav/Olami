No-Shave November season is upon us again and this year if you are a member of an IFC fraternity, simply not shaving will raise money for the Children’s Miracle Network in partnership with Knight-thon.
Knightnews.com took it upon ourselves to scour the UCF campus on Thursday to find the best beards on campus. Although No-Shave November started today, our Comedy Correspondent, Evan Gregory, already got a month long head start on the competition.
According the www.ifcucf.com, the official IFC website there will be a prize for the best beard,  “The member with the best beard will be voted and decided upon at our Frats at Bat Philanthropy on December 2nd and crowned “Best Beard”.

The Unofficial Rules and Guidelines for No-Shave November:
1. Stow away your razor, beard trimmer, or electric razor. You will not be needing that until December.
2. Waxing is out of the question, although we hope you would never dare.
3. Absolutely no trimming of the hair on the upper lip, just let it happen.
4. If one starts to grow a unibrow, plucking is the only allowed method, although it is frowned upon. The unibrow is in style, just ask New Orleans Hornets Forward Anthony Davis.
5. Happy growing.

SGA held a student update and open forum discussion on Wednesday in the Student Union’s Key West Ballroom to provide UCF students the chance to learn about ongoing events and initiatives SGA officials have taken since being elected to office. SGA’s President, Cortez Whatley, and Vice President, Rachel Brill, both spoke at the meeting, along with other SGA members of the executive branch.
“Its very important students are aware of all of the services we do and how much work goes into planning all of this,” said SGA’s Public Relations Coordinator, Funlola Falade. “We’re holding this meeting because there’s a lot of misinformation out there, as well as a lot of resources for students to use that they don’t know about, and thus can’t take advantage of. We want students to know where money is going and what we’re providing for them.”
President Cortez Whatley began the meeting by addressing the 15% increase in differential tuition, a decision that has recently caused some criticism from fellow UCF students, particularly from the Student Labor Action Project. Whatley defended the decision as being made in the best interest of the student body, and that over 90 instructors would have been lost at UCF without the increase in tuition.
“The tuition spike accumulated about $13 million. Five-and-a-half of it went to financial aid, but the remainder went to study aids, instructors, tutors and other programs at UCF, liberal arts programs in particular, that would have been lost without it,” said Whatley. “Losing those instructors and programs would have been a lot more impactful to a lot more students, so that was the rational behind the decision.”
Whatley also addressed some of SGA’s accomplishments since taking office, including the advertisement of scholarships on myUCF, a partnership with the Lou Frey institute that has helped some 1,800 students register to vote, the expansion of All Knight Study expected to open at the end of the month, and the upcoming Light Up UCF, what Whatley called the only event of it’s kind in the state.
Vice President Rachel Brill spoke next, followed by other members of the executive cabinet of SGA, addressing a food recycling initiative, bus services from UCF to the Orlando International Airport, free flu shots at UCF, and lower textbook costs for students.
“We’re working with the UCF Bookstore to create a student discount day that would allow a 5-10% discount on textbooks at the start of each semester,” said SGA Director of Student Affairs, Trevor Persaud. “We’re also looking at a program called ‘CourseSmart’ for students who want to download e-books at a 40-60% discount. UCF has contracts with Barnes and Noble and the UCF Bookstore, so we don’t want to overstep our boundaries, but we really want to advocate this for students.”
Following the updates, an open forum was held, where the topic of the increased tuition rates was once again raised, this time, why a 15% raise was necessary versus only an 8% raise.
“Anything less than 15% and you would have seen dramatic changes to student life on campus, particularly education, which is the sole purpose of this institution,” said Whatley. “I can’t tell you exactly what 8% would look like, but I can tell you we’d be in a much worse place than we are now.”




No matter how hard UCF SGA President Cortez Whatley tries to shift student focus onto his initiatives, he hasn’t been able to shake the scrutiny of his decision to hike tuition the maximum amount possible.
A Student Government forum on Wednesday, which was meant to acknowledge student concerns and updates within SGA, was met with outraged students who felt that Whatley’s decision to hike tuition 15% was unnecessary due to UCF’s large reserves.
Students questioned Whatley about raising tuition the maximum amount instead of using UCF’s reported $125 million in reserve funds to cover the one time $50 million budget cut to the university. When asked about the reserve system, however, Whatley was uncertain of the details surrounding the fund.
“It’s more so funding that just hasn’t been spent yet, but in most cases contractual agreements to be spent…I don’t know exactly what the money is there to be spent on but I do know there are financial obligations tied to the majority of it…” said Whatley.
One student even went so far as to say that Whatley’s decision to hike tuition without knowing all of the facts behind the reserve system shows “gross incompetence.”
At a legislative session earlier this year, Florida Senator Don Gaetz told SGA students protesting the one time budget cuts throughout the state university system  that the cuts would not affect student life and operations at the institutions, but were merely a way to “draw down their reserves, reserves that belong to the public.” 
Whatley in direct contrast however, states that without the 15% tuition hikes, majors and other academic life would be disrupted. “Without the increase, we would have been looking at losing programs this fall, particularly programs in the social sciences, most likely, the liberal arts, the arts…” said Whatley.
A member of SLAP, Student Labor Action Project, told us that he believed it was Whatley’s duty to stand up for the student voice and find some sort of middle ground between the budget cuts, tuition hikes and large reserve fund.
“As the student representative, didn’t he have a duty to speak up for students in both his capacities where he does have real power…” he said.
