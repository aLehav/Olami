NYCFC returned to face Orlando City in a match that seemed to be dominated by the Lions.
A turnaround from the inaugural match featuring the two, and an away game at New York, Orlando City led the visiting team with 14 shots and majority possession for the first half and much of the second, enough for a 2-1 final score to make the series 1-1-1.
Possession largely remained in the hands of the purple and gold as NYCFC struggled to keep ball handling an even matchup. The Lions allowed little room for their rival to take control of the first half and held the game to 0-0 until the 46th minute, where a deflected corner kick found its way past Orlando goalkeeper Tally Hall to close the half.
Needing ground to cover, Orlando turned near-goals into game-changers fifteen minutes into the second half with Cyle Larin’s equalizer assisted by Cory Ashe. Eight minutes later, the Canadian rookie returned to dangerous territory for NYCFC and scored what would decide, in favor of, Orlando City’s continuing playoff contention.
Cyle Larin continued to smash the MLS all-time rookie scoring record with 17 goals thus far and two on Friday night, tying for third in MLS overall. A tripled shot on goal to make a hat trick for Larin crossed into the net but referees did not signal a score and gameplay would go uninterrupted.
Late into the second half with six minutes left in regular time, goalkeeper Josh Ford made his MLS debut after an injured Tally Hall was assisted off the field due to an unknown injury, suspected to be to the ACL. Ford, with cautious intention, prevented NYCFC from returning to a lead with a caught cross and a few clears.

Forty-three thousand fans filled the Citrus Bowl to watch the Lions complete their final home match on a five-game win streak. Orlando City players and staff took to the field following end of play to celebrate the unwavering support by fans through their inaugural season.
