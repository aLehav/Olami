At least 13 vehicles had their windows shattered and items stolen between Friday and Saturday at UCF’s main campus, according to a campuswide alert.
A UCFPD officer on-scene said the break-ins happened between 11:30 p.m. Friday to 4:30 a.m. Saturday.
The break-in took place in parking lot B7, and UCF said similar activity was reported in a nearby off-campus, unaffiliated apartment complex.
UCF Police are currently investigating the incident. There are no known suspects at this time.
It appears the burglar chose random cars in the lot, and police took information from victims at the scene. UCFPD dusted the cars for fingerprints and looked for evidence.
UCF freshman Riley Standifer reported the incident to UCFPD at 4:30 a.m. He walked out to his car and saw windows shattered and glass on the ground. His car was not damaged.
“I grabbed my stuff, and went back to my room, and just called my RA,” Standifer said. “We talked to the police.”
Matthew Slider is a student at UCF. The burglar broke into his car named “Shelly.”
“It’s a little upsetting,” Slider said. “I was hoping to go to Starbucks this morning.”
Slider said the sunglasses were $50. His friends helped him clean up the glass and drove the car off the lot. 
“I don’t have anything valuable in my car, all they stole was some sunglasses,” Slider said.
Other students were upset and declined to speak. 
Parking lot B7 is on Gemini Boulevard South, near the UCF Recreation and Wellness Center.
Knight News has reached out to a Public Information Officer for comment.
“We ask all members of the UCF community to be especially vigilant. Keep an eye out for activity that seems suspicious, and don’t hesitate to contact police immediately when you see it,” UCFPD said in the alert. “Practice good habits like always locking your vehicle and keeping any valuables out of sight.”
