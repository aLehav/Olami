An email was sent out to the entire UCF Greek community banning alcohol from any and all events, effective this Tuesday.
The email starts off by saying, “We the leaders of the Greek community are still in the discussion and planning stage of what changes need to be enacted within our community in the aftermath of recent events.”


Although the university panel issuing the moratorium receives state funding, no notice of this meeting was sent to the press and Greek leaders KnightNews.com spoke with didn’t know a measure this major was going to be discussed and enacted until after it was too late for public comment.
KnightNews.com will also work to get a comment from Greek Council student leaders about this decision. Check back for updates on this major developing story.
