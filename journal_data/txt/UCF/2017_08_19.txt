Free same-day pickup and free returns drop offs are now available to UCF students at Amazon’s newest location in Knights Plaza.
Students at UCF can choose to have orders delivered to the pickup point and either pick up the package at the counter or retrieve it from a secure self-service locker that can be opened using a security code.

The central location of UCF’s campus will allow for easier and more efficient delivery of packages, translating to faster deliveries and returns.


The building won’t be operated by the university although will be available to UCF students, where service behind the counters will come from UCF students.
Amazon pickup locations are generally open from 9 a.m. through 9 p.m. on weekdays and 12 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends.
