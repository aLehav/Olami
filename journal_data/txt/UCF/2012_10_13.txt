Police are currently investigating a car jacking that took place on UCF’s campus late Saturday evening during a football game.
University of Central Florida spokesman, Chad Binette, stated that a man punched a worker in the face and stole his car at the entrance to a parking lot near the Bright House Networks Stadium.
It is reported that the man then fled in the vehicle down Orion Boulevard before abandoning the car and running into the nearby wooded area.
Suspect
The alleged suspect, Karl Stanborough, 20, was apprehended by police with the help of canine units. The suspect was then taken to the hospital for non-life threatening issues.
According to UCF, the carjacking occurred at about 9 p.m. Saturday during the second quarter of the game. Stanborough was captured during halftime.
