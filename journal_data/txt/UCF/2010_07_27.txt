UCF’s Homecoming committee hasn’t released any details about Homecoming to KnightNews.com, so it is not yet confirmed the artists’ performances are linked officially to Homecoming, however, during last year’s festivities, the big name artists playing at the arena during Homecoming week, T-Pain and Asher Roth, were made part of the official Homecoming celebrations.
KnightNews.com reported last year how T-Pain and Roth partied with students at local bars, buying expensive bottles to drink with the students and then walking out on their tabs. At the time, we reported how T-Pain was quite generous with alcohol, and spent some time pouring bottles of it into the mouths of all the ladies who could manage to fight their way through the crowd.
LMFAO and Ludacris are scheduled to perform from 8 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, October 16.
Read our story from last year and see more pictures of T-Pain and Roth partying at Scoop. If the Homecoming committee releases more details, KnightNews.com will pass them along to you.
