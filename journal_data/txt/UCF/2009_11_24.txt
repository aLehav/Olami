It’s not even noon yet, and already hundreds of people are lined up at Orlando’s Barnes and Nobles bookstore to see Sarah Palin at 7:30 p.m.
The former vice presidential candidate is on a book tour, promoting her best seller, “Going Rogue.”
The first person to show up in line reportedly came 24 hours before the event to secure a spot in line.
Some say Palin is controversial, while others say she’s exactly what this country needs.
