Voting has officially opened today for the 2012 SGA president and Vice President candidates. 
Campaigns began early this morning and will continue into the night as supporters rally for votes. Both campaigns have a range of free, yes FREE, food from places like Tenders and Wackadoos.
We stopped outside the Student Union this afternoon to see how elections were going:

Keep checking back for more information about campaigns and to see who will win the election.
