The Herman Cain Truth tour came to UCF on Wednesday evening at the UCF Arena.
Cain spoke to a small crowd gathered around him in an intimate setting on the floor of the UCF Arena. Cain touched on subjects such as his feelings on ObamaCare, his future political plans, and the purpose of him touring the nationâ€™s college campuses speaking to students.
After his speech we caught up to have a one-on-one conversation with Cain where we talked about UCF tuition and advice for UCF students entering the job market.
