John Stamos, the actor who played Jesse Katsopolis on “Full House,” posted a tweet on Sunday night, saying he was “broken” and “gutted” by the news of Saget’s passing. 
I am broken. I am gutted.  I am in complete and utter shock.  I will never ever have another friend like him.  I love you so much Bobby.
