UCF’s biggest football rival will have a new coach at the helm next season.
Oregon confirmed on Wednesday that USF’s head football coach Willie Taggart has been hired to lead the Ducks next season.
The Oregon Ducks struggled in 2016, posting a 4-8 record that led to then head coach Mark Helfrich’s termination.
Taggart will head to Oregon after leading the USF Bulls to a 10-2 record, their best record in school history. Coach Taggart led the Bulls for four seasons, taking them from a two-win season in his first year as head coach to 10 wins in 2016.
Oregon will introduce their new head coach to Eugene in a press conference on Thursday.
Coach Taggart’s departure could cause a shake-up in the American Athletic Conference, as well as potentially give UCF an edge in this year’s recruiting.
Potential candidates to replace Taggart at USF include Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin, Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano, former Texas Longhorns’ coach Charlie Strong, and FSU’s co-offensive coordinator Lawrence Dawsey, ESPN reported.
