The #8 UCF Knights football team boarded team buses and headed to Orlando Sanford International Airport for their flight to the 2019 Fiesta Bowl. 
The big surprise of this early morning departure was McKenzie Milton boarding the offensive team bus along with his teammates. Milton boarded the bus with crutches when the team landed in Phoenix QB Darrel Mack Jr. took Milton’s crutches from him, so he could walk down the stairs of the plane. 
The team departed campus at 7:30 AM this morning and landed in Phoenix late this afternoon. The team was greeted by Fiesta Bowl officials on the tarmac in Arizona. 
Head Coach Josh Heupel greeted the media as he boarded the plane but was not available for interviews. In Arizona at the opening press conference for UCF, Heupel echoed the same message from the start of the season.
 “For us, it’s a way to send our seniors out in the right way. It’s an opportunity to again put our brand, our logo in front of the entire country and do it in a great way,” said Heupel. “Our mantra the entire season has been about going 1-0, focusing on the things that really matter, which is on preparation.”
The Knights will take on #11 LSU Tigers on New Year’s Day. This is the second straight year the knights are in an NY6 bowl game. The mentality of UCF this time around is to send out their senior players on a high note. 
UCF Defensive Lineman Titus Davis said, “For me, and Wyatt as well, we’re seniors so this is our last game and our last time to go out with a bang. So we’re trying to do that.”
