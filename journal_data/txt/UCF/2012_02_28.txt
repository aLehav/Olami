UCF Cornerback Josh Robinson who helped the Knights win their first bowl game, posted the fastest 40-yard dash time Tuesday at the NFL combine.
Robinson, who wasn’t even on the top 100 draft prospects, shook up the field beating out LSU Cornerback Ron Brooks 4.33 to 4.37.
The two cornerbacks were only two cornerbacks in the entire combine to break the 4.4 mark and only 2 out of 9 players to break the 4.5 mark.
Robinson was later featured on ESPN as a “come out of nowhere” type of player which seems to be the trend in professional sports as of late. They compared his size to that of a true NFL-size cornerback, and many think he may make moves on the draft board.
Currently, Robinson is currently ranked 17th out of available cornerbacks in the upcoming NFL draft which is April 26th-28th 2012.
