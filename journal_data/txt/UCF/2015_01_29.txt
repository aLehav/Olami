The UCF Board of Trustees unanimously voted to transfer $2.6 million from reserve funds to fund the new East Side Club that will be located inside of Bright House Networks Stadium at Thursday’s meeting.
The 10,000-square-foot East Side Club that is going to serve beer, frozen drinks and cocktails is expected to be ready by the Sept. 5 kickoff against FIU.
Memberships to the East Side Club will start at $900 per person for a full season pass. The membership will include access to chair-back stadium seating, 15 televisions, Gold Zone parking and private restrooms.
