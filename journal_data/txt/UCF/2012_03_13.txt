The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity has been planning on what they hope to be the largest grossing philanthropy in UCF Greek History.

Knightnews.com caught up Tal Wollschlaeger, the President of Phi Delta Theta, to talk about the Music Fest event, which will take place at Memory Mall on March 17th.
The Music Fest to Defeat ALS event will have artists such as Eden’s Edge and Johnny Bulford, along with many other games and activities that will last all day.
The Phi Delta Theta Philanthropy Chair Danny Mitchell told Knightnews.com that from now until the event any student in Cornerstone that sells tickets will have 30 percent of tickets they sell go back to them.

The UCF Recreation and Wellness Center (RWC) has plans to open a new, satellite facility at UCF’s Knights Plaza.
The RWC Facebook Page released this message: “We want this facility to be much calmer and less intimidating than our main facility. It will be mostly sectioned off into rooms so workouts will be more private. It will also include a mind and body studio for classes like yoga and pilates. More details to come very soon! We’re glad you all are excited.” The new center will also include all three components of a fitness center with some free weights, machines weights, and cardio equipment.
We contacted the director of UCF’s RWC, Jim Wilkening, who told us they hope to open the new facility in the Fall of 2012.

The proposed budget has not been released as the new facility is still in the design stages and it is unclear at this time where the funding is coming from.
As soon as more work is done on the new facility, KnightNews.com will plan on having an exclusive inside looks as to what can be expected. Until then, check out some photos of the new site.
