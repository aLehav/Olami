Police Chief Richard Beary called him “a career criminal”.
These remarks were made referring to a Steven Marshall, who UCF police officers apprehended just before midnight on Tuesday, November 15. Marshall is suspected of attempting to break in to vending machines on campus, Beary said.
Two officers were patrolling the fourth floor of the Engineering 2 building when they spotted the individual, who claimed his name was “Chris.” The officers said they recognized the suspect from a bulletin they saw prior to the shift. The officers claim that when they attempted to handcuff the suspect, Marshall ran from the police until he was tackled by one of the officers.
Marshall has been apprehended by the UCFPD before, and had an active trespass warning on him at the time of the incident, police said.
Police say that Marshall was found in possession of a tire iron, hidden in his waist band at the time of the incident, and put up a fight when officers attempted to apprehend him. 
Following his arrest, police say Marshall was very combative, threatening to spit on officers. Police reported that Marshall even broke the door the holding cell inside the UCF Policed Department, causing $1500 in estimated damage. Police then had to transport Marshall to another cell.
Police Chief Richard Beary told Knight News that he believed Marshall was able to get into the Engineering building by a student who held the door open for him. Beary encouraged students to only allow themselves in when using their access card, to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the building. 
Marshall faces charges of Trespassing on School Property with a Weapon, and Criminal Mischief, among other charges.
