As UCF students come back into town after a week of Spring Break, KnightNews.com is seeing students asking what’s open and what’s not. 
So we checked the hours of popular places on campus and found out the following for Saturday: The UCF Gym is open but the UCF Library is closed. 
On Sunday, the UCF library will reopen with normal Sunday spring hours of 12 p.m. to 1 a.m., according to the library website.
