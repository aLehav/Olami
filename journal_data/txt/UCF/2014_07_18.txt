The City of Cocoa Beach officials met on Thursday evening to discuss possibly banning alcohol on the beach starting next year.
A 14-page presentation was released by Cocoa Beach City Manager Bob Majka that suggested that a 2015 beach-drinking moratorium from March 1 to Sept. 30.
“Cocoa Beach was once known as the jewel of the Space Coast, and it’s time to polish that jewel,” said Cocoa Beach City Mayor Dave Netterstrom.

The ban could range anywhere from certain parts of the beach, days of the week or even a blanket ban across the entire beach.
The meeting comes a week after a couple was arrested on the beach for indecent exposure.
City officials decided to move forward with the ideas and hold workshops for the business owners and residents before making any decisions.
