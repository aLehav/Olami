Knight News was there on Monday evening to capture the first impressions of two UCF students trying Chick-fil-A’s newest menu item: Mac & Cheese.
Both students, Jesus Ramirez and Daniel Sierra, gave praise to the Mac and concluded that they’d happily order it again.
On a scale of 1 to 10, Sierra, a UCF senior, rated it a convincing 7.2 and gave it a well-spoken review.
“It’s really good. On the top there’s a layer of cheese which is a pretty good addition to the normal Mac and Cheese flavor,” the bio-med senior said.
Ramirez exclaimed “Go Knights!” before diving in. “Wow, indeed! I’m another satisfied customer,” he told Knight News. “It’s delicious, creamy, it’s what you think of Mac and Cheese.”

The new side item officially made the menu nationwide on Monday and is the first addition to the chicken chain’s permanent menu since 2016, Chick-fil-A said in a press release.
“Mac & Cheese is the quintessential comfort food, and something we are so excited to offer our guests at Chick-fil-A. We think it’s the perfect pairing with our Original Chicken Sandwich, nuggets and our grilled chicken offerings, but it’s also great on its own as a snack,” said Amanda Norris, executive director of menu and packaging.
The new side order which sells for roughly $2.99, a ballpark price for most Chick-fil-A sides, was first tested in five markets and was warmly received during that time.
“We have a very high bar when it comes to adding a menu item,” said Norris, “but the feedback from our customers in the test markets made this decision easy.”
