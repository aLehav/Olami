About a month ago, Knightnews.com broke the story about the Alpha Delta Pi Lion, Alphie, being reported stolen. In the article, ADPi threatened to file a police report if the lion was not returned by the start of Spring semester.
Knightnews.com contacted the UCF Police Department, and it was confirmed that the lion, valued at 900 dollars, is still missing, and a police report has been filed to find the missing statue.
The lion, which sat on the back porch of the ADPi house, has lots of sentimental value to the sorority, being that it was given to them upon the opening of the house.
UCF Police Department Sgt. Troy Williamson is not taking the stolen lion lightly, urging all students with any information pertaining to where the lion is at to call the UCF Police Department.
