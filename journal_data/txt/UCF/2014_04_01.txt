UCF Athletics released a photo on April 1 showing a new UCF football uniform with “C. Florida” on the front of the uniform as part of an April Fools prank.
Many UCF fans have griped about ESPN using “C. Florida” during broadcasts of nationally televised games instead of the preferred “UCF” by fans.
UCF Athletics released the photo of the uniform on Facebook and Twitter with nothing but the caption “Thoughts?”.
The photo received roughly 50 replies on Twitter of fans denouncing the uniform or some that caught on to the April Fools joke.
UCF football will be back in action for the spring game on April 12 at 2 p.m.
