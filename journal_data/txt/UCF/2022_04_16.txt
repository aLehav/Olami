Knight Nation will not have to wait much longer.
2023 three-star tight end Jayvontay Conner announced to Twitter on Friday that he will be announcing his commitment this upcoming Wednesday at East Forsyth High School (Kernersville, North Carolina).
The UCF target will be choosing between his final six schools: Florida State, Maryland, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Virginia Tech, and the Knights.
The 6-foot-4, 230-pound tight end is currently ranked by 247sports as the nation’s No. 51 tight end and the No. 26 prospect in North Carolina for the class of 2023.
Conner took an official visit to UCF on Wednesday, where he flexed in the iconic Space Game uniform.
With a commitment, Conner would add more depth to a tight end room that currently includes senior Alec Holler, Florida transfer Kenmore Gamble, and 2022 three-star commit Grant Stevens.
The three-star’s 2021 film shows he is capable of scoring touchdowns, outrunning defensive backs, and overpowering defenders with his run blocking abilities.
Conner would be the third three-star UCF commit for the class of 2023, joining pass rushers Kaven Call and Troy Ford.
