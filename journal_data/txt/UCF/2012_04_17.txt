On Monday, fellow Greeks packed into Brooklyn Pizza, where the annual Xi-Man pageant was held. After a brother from almost every fraternity on campus put in over month of hard work to win over the hearts of Alpha Xi Delta, Daniel Balva from Zeta Beta Tau was crowned as Xi-Man 2012. Matthew Wagener of Phi Delta Theta was runner-up.
Check back soon for video of some of the skits the contestants put on and the crowning of Xi-Man 2012:
