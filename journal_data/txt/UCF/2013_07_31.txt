The founding chairman of the University of Central Florida’s biology department has died. 
Leslie Ellis Jr., who also served as acting university president after Charles Millican retired in 1978, died Tuesday, UCF said. He was 87.
Leslie Ellis According to UCF, Ellis joined the school in 1968 after working at Mississippi State University. He retired in 1991, but returned to the university briefly in 1993 as interim vice president of research.
Ellis held a variety of positions at UCF throughout his many years — including the school’s first provost from 1981 to 1986, as well as dean and associate vice president of Graduate Studies and Research, vice president of Academic Affairs, director of the Office of Research Park Affairs, and interim dean of the College of Health and Public Services.
“I remember when we first arrived that there were only two buildings and a lot of scrub land at the university, and how proud Dad was just being here,” Ellis’ son Dan told UCF. “Also, when the university got what I think was its first computer and he took us all out there to see it. It took up a whole room.”
In addition to sons Dan of Maitland and Robin of Reno, Nev., he is survived by son, Leslie III of Berwick, La.; daughter, Christin Stafford of Mattawan, Mich.; 12 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.
