The trial started this morning with a continuance of Jury selection from yesterday’s session and is currently being finalized. A final Jury was expected to be seated by Noon when lunch breaks, with opening statements expected to begin immediately after.

However, Jury selection has been drawn out and heated between the plaintiff and defense and selection/finalization may not conclude until after lunch break.
Lunch is expected to break at Noon and resume session at 1:30 PM. Coverage will continue then and throughout today’s session.
Update 12:00 p.m.: Jury selection and deliberation has taken a break for lunch and is expected to resume at 1:30 p.m.. 
After speaking with attorneys and others in audience, it seems likely that there might be one or possibly even no opening statements today as Jury selection has not neared an end at this point. Inability to agree on Jurors on either side has delayed the process and might consume the rest of today’s session. Coverage will continue when session resumes at 1:30 PM.
Update  5:30 p.m.: Today’s session has concluded and after two days of the trial a jury has not been selected.
Jury selection was narrowed down from 32 possible jurors this morning to 22 possible jurors at the end of the day.
At request of the Judge, both legal teams are cooperating as closely as possible to try and expedite the process, with both sides fully confident in having a final Jury seated by lunch break Wednesday afternoon. 
Opening statements are also expected to begin Wednesday directly after the lunch break. That would most likely start around 1:30 p.m..
Knightnews will be providing continuing coverage throughout the remainder of the trial. Check back for live updates for tomorrow including the opening statements, and throughout the week.
