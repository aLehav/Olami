After becoming the first Knight to win the World Series, Drew Butera will be taking his championship on the big screen appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live Wednesday night.
The Kansas City Royals will be represented on the late-night talk show by Butera, right-hander Jeremy Guthrie and third baseman Mike Moustakas, according to MLB. Alongside them will be Royals fan and Modern Family actor Eric Stonestreet.
The Jimmy Kimmel Live ordeal regarding the Royals began when Stonestreet visited Kimmel’s show. Kimmel, a New York Mets fan, made a bet from the “Wheel of Terrible Bets” with Stonestreet over who will win the World Series.

Needless to say, Stonestreet will be collecting what is rightfully his Wednesday night. 
Tonight I will be collecting on my bet with @jimmykimmel. I will have some KC Royalty to help me provide the welts. @JimmyKimmelLive 🔵🔵🔵 🔫

The UCF women’s soccer team advanced in the AAC Championships after coming out victorious in November 3rd’s semifinal match with a 2-1 win against Temple Tuesday night.
Ashley Spivey scored for the Knights on an assist by Carol Rodriguez in the 21st minute of the match.
Rodriguez made a header down to Spivey who then kicked a rocket pass the Temple defenders and goalkeeper could not react quick enough to stop. Spivey now has six game-winners this season and needs one more to match the school record. The Knights’ second score drew from an own goal by Temple in the 7th minute of the game.
“We didn’t have our best game today, but we have to focus on the positive,” said Head Coach Tiffany Roberts Sahaydak. “We scored a couple goals and we won the game.”
The Knights will face their rivals No. 25 USF at SMU’s Westcott Field this Thursday at 8.30 p.m. ET.
“I’m really excited to play South Florida,” said Sahaydak. “I thought we had our best game of the season against them, so I know that our team is very respectful of that team and it’s usually an emotional game. I think we play our best when we have those emotions, looking forward to that game.”
The Knights had USF’s number the last time they played, beating them 3-1 on October 23rd. The Knights have momentum on their side going into Thursday’s contest.
“I know it’s going to be a battle like normal,” said Sahaydak. “It should be a great semifinal match.”
