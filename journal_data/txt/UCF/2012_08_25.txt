UPDATE 2:30pm: All University of Central Florida campuses will be open as usual on Monday.
UCF Officials met Sunday afternoon and determined that the school will remain open and on a normal basis. UCF will continue to monitor the storm and notify students about any changes.
Central Florida is no longer under a tropical storm watch as of 5pm.
***************************************************************************************
Tropical Storm Isaac is slowly making its way towards the western coast of Florida and bringing with it its heavy winds and rain.
While the storm is expected to keep to the West, the nearly 850 mile wide storm will bring 40-50mph gusts to Central Florida by Monday.
We asked UCF about their preparations for the storm and what students should do in order to be safe.
UCF’s Associate Vice President of Communications & Public Affairs Grant Heston said, “We are monitoring the storm closely, and we will continue to do so. In terms of classes, we will make a decision at the appropriate time this weekend with the safety of our campus community in mind.”

Should classes be cancelled, UCF will notify students via text message and email and also post the information on www.ucf.edu.
The school encourages all students, staff and faculty members to make sure they have enough food, water and other supplies to last 72 hours.



NBC has reported that Neil Armstrong, the commander of Apollo 11 and the first man on the moon, has died at age 82.
His family reports his death was due to complications of heart procedures following heart bypass surgery earlier this month. It is not clear on where he died however, he did reside in Cincinnati.

On July 20, 1969, Armstrong became the first human to ever touch the surface of the moon, reciting the famous quote “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” This great accomplishment meant victory for the United States in regards to the “space race” of the Cold War.
The family has released the following statement in regards to Neil’s death:
“We are heartbroken to share the news that Neil Armstrong has passed away following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures. Neil was our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend.
Neil Armstrong was also a reluctant American hero who always believed he was just doing his job. He served his Nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut. He also found success back home in his native Ohio in business and academia, and became a community leader in Cincinnati.
He remained an advocate of aviation and exploration throughout his life and never lost his boyhood wonder of these pursuits. As much as Neil cherished his privacy, he always appreciated the expressions of good will from people around the world and from all walks of life.
While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves.
For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request. Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.”
