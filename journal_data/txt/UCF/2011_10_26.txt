This past Saturday UCF hosted an unforgettable line-up for its Black and Gold Revolution Homecoming Concert Knight. Featuring a musical line-up that included DJ Wiz Kid, Eric Hutchinson, Panic! At the Disco, and Lupe Fiasco.

Highly awaited performers Panic! At the Disco and Lupe Fiasco sang several of their most well-known songs including Panic!’s “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” and from Lupe’s latest album Lasers, “The Show Goes On.” Between Panic! At the Disco lead singer Brendon Urie’s eccentric performance style and Lupe’s drenching of the front crowd, student response of the show overall seemed positive.
Check out a few photos from Saturday’s concert.
