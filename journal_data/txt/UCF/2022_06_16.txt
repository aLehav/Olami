The 122nd U.S. Open kicked off Thursday morning, and the leaderboard may surprise you.
Canadian golfer Adam Hadwin leads the field after Round 1, shooting a four-under-par 66.
Hadwin’s appearance in this year’s U.S. Open only came to be when Paul Casey withdrew due to an injury. Being the alternate, Hadwin gained his pass to play.
Although Hadwin isn’t new to playing in majors, he still has a lot of golf to play if he wants to keep his lead.
Trailing behind for second place is four-time major champion winner Rory McIlroy.
He ended his round shooting a three-under-par 67.
After coming off his win last week at the RBC Canadian Open, McIlroy is on the hunt for another win.
Three more rounds are still left to play this week, and it could be anyone’s game.
To watch tomorrows coverage of the U.S. Open, viewers can watch on the USA Network from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. or on NBC from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.



Tesla’s Chief Executive Elon Musk said that he is leaning toward supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis if he runs for president in 2024. 
Musk was asked on Twitter who he was ‘leaning toward’ for president and replied simply with one word, “DeSantis”. 
When DeSantis was asked about Musk’s support for a potential 2024 run, he replied: 
“I welcome support from African-Americans, what can I say,” said DeSantis jokingly. Musk grew up in South Africa. 
The Tesla Executive said he voted for a republican for the first time for Mayra Flores for a southern Texas Congressional District 
I voted for Mayra Flores – first time I ever voted Republican. Massive red wave in 2022.
“I voted for Mayra Flores, first time I ever voted Republican,” said Musk in a tweet. “Massive red wave in 2022.” 



UCF and the nation’s Space University signs partnership agreement to develop technology for the U.S. Space Force. 
According to UCF Today, the two organizations signed an educational partnership agreement after three members spent a day at UCF learning about the university’s space-related research. 
The agreement will focus on six of the following areas:  
Improving freedom of action in, from and to the space domain 
Improving the survivability and resilience of space systems and architectures 
Digital engineering and model-based system engineering 
Increasing responsible artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomy 
Improving space access, mobility and logistics 
Enhancement and integration of existing services from and through an expanded space domain 
The agreement also states there may be opportunities for faculty exchanges, for collaborative research projects and for student internship opportunities. 
Grace Bochenek, the director of UCF’s School for Modeling, Simulation and Training said she believes the new agreement will allow the flexibility needed to bring the type of results the Space Force is looking for. 
“We have a lot of strengths in areas that are of interest to Space Force such as modeling and simulation, engineering and interdisciplinary research,” said Bochenek “The EPA allows us a lot of flexibility so we can work together and help drive the kind of innovation that the Space Force is looking for while also developing an agile workforce that’s got the right stuff and is ready to go.” 



Florida officials have not submitted requests for the Covid vaccines that are tailored for children. These vaccines are effective for children aging from six months to five years.
On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for children.
Although recommended for children, Governor Ron DeSantis has not ordered any vaccines for the state of Florida.
According to DeSantis, there is “practically zero risks” for children who are that young if they contract Covid without the vaccine.
Although the state isn’t ordering vaccines for children, individual practices and hospitals are able to order the vaccines for patients who want it.

SEAWORLD ELECTRIC OCEAN FOOD REVIEW! 🌊🎢🐬Reporter @AcarsonUCFNEWS gives you a review of one the the exclusive desserts being offered at @seaworldorlando ‘s premier summer event Electric Ocean that runs until Sept. 5 #seaworld #seaworldorlando #themparknews #foodreview pic.twitter.com/KT1IgqWVtU
Electric ocean is included with your regular theme park admission on select dates, so you will be able to experience you’re your favorite rides from Ice breaker to infinity falls while enjoying five new entertaining new shows being offered throughout the park. 
For Guests who love take walk down Sesame Street land to see Big bird and the gang they will now be offered a new show called Elmo Rocks where you can sing along in a new rock themed show exclusive to electric ocean. 
Rescue tails night vision is a new attraction for the event where guests will meet some exotic nocturnal animals in a fun and educational presentation about animal rescue. This experience is less a show and more of an educational experience, so if you’re looking for something a little more entertaining you might want to skip this. 
As the Sunsets, Bayside Stadium comes alive with dazzling neon lights and club music as the stage becomes a dance floor for all guests show off their moves with dancers and performers all while the DJ mixes music all night long in a high-energy atmosphere in Club Sea Glow;. This I believe is the highlight of the event and one that if you’re excited about seeing the neon lights and dancers for the promo commercials for Electric Ocean, this is the experience you will want to make a priority over everything else. 
Each night will be capped off with a new fireworks display called Ignite 360 where guest will be treated to a mix of pulsing music, with a combination of a fountain and fireworks display the will bring the luminescent colors of the sea to the sky that can be seen anywhere in the park to finish off you’re evening.

Verdict: 
If your used to other seasonal events presented by SeaWorld like ‘SeaWorld’s Christmas Celebration’ and ‘Howl-O-Scream’, you might find the theming for it a little underwhelming with patches of the park not decorated in ‘Electric Ocean’ colors or signage and may leave guests feeling like its just another day in the park. The biggest pluses for the event are the summer and ride themed drinks and food items. The empanadas are much better than your average theme park food offering and the Mako themed cocktail is a personal favorite. The Dance party at bayside stadium for ‘Club Sea Glow’ is the hallmark of the event for guests and younger children to have fun dancing to high energy ‘PG’ club music along with neon-colored performers. ‘Ignite 360’ is a fun dazzling display of fireworks but is very short and is nothing extraordinary compared to other Themepark offerings at Disney and Universal in the area. The key to understand is that this is not a separate ticketed item so while I wouldn’t go out of my way to go to this event on its own, it is a nice addition to your regular park experience if you visit SeaWorld in the near future.
