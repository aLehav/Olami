University of Central Florida student Chloe Arenas lost control of her car and submerged it into the pond near State Road 408 exit and Alafaya Trail on Sunday at around 5:15 a.m., Florida Highway Patrol reported, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 
The Orlando Sentinel reported that Arenas died at the scene. 
“The 21-year-old UCF student left a friend’s house to pick up her family about 4 a.m. after going out earlier in the night,” Clarissa Lindsey, Arenas’ friend told the Orlando Sentinel.
“Arenas had gone out with friends to Howl At the Moon off International Drive earlier in the night, Lindsey said, and had returned to her friend’s house about 1 a.m.,” according the Orlando Sentinel.
Lindsey told the Orlando Sentinel that she suspects her friend fell asleep behind the wheel and that Arenas had a hard time “staying awake when it’s dark out.”
UCF spokesman Mark Schlueb confirmed to the Orlando Sentinel that Arenas started UCF in the summer of 2012.
“State troopers have not confirmed any details about Arenas’ death,” said the Orlando Sentinel.
A GoFundMe has been set up for funeral arrangements.
