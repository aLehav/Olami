Kim Kardashian fans woke up to a sweet surprise on February 22nd when the reality star released the first ever picture of her son Saint West on her website and app. Saint West was born on  December 5th and the family has kept pictures of Saint under wraps until today. “Today is my dad’s birthday. I know there’s nothing more in the world he would have wanted than to meet his grandchildren. So I wanted to share this pic of Saint with you all,” Kim Kardashian wrote on her website. 
In the picture Saint is soundly asleep in a white onesie with his arms in the air. Watch out Kendall and Kylie, Baby Saint has been trending on twitter since the picture surfaced. Here at the University of Central Florida students didn’t seem that impressed with the news of baby Saints picture.
“I didn’t even know there was a pic of Saint” said UCF student Marisa Payne. Another student, Simone Tamburi, said “Seems like a lot of hype built up for just a picture of a baby.”
