Blake Bortles has a tough decision to make after seeing NFL draft experts continue to mention him as a top 2014 draft prospect.
Bortles was named as the No. 2 quarterback prospect by ESPN’s Todd McShay and was recently named as possibly jumping Teddy Bridgewater as the overall No. 1 quarterback prospect by Sports Illustrated writer Peter King.

“I know one team that, as of now, thinks it’s no sure thing Teddy Bridgewater will be the top quarterback on its board,” King said. “Moreover, this team believes Central Florida’s Blake Bortles or Johnny Manziel could be the top quarterback on the board.”
The NFL draft process hasn’t even begun, and Bortles said he will not look into making a decision until after the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1. Bortles and Bridgewater are both underclassmen, so much of the draft stock hinges on whether or not they decide to pursue NFL dreams or stay another year.
