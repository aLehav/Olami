It’s a tradition held at school’s such as Penn State and now, it could become one at UCF.
UCF students have started a Facebook page and plan to camp outside Bright House Networks Stadium before the game against the South Carolina Gamecocks this Saturday at noon.
“Come on out to the student entrance gate at the Bright House Networks Stadium to camp out the night before the big game! Bring a tent, sleeping bag, food, or whatever you would normally bring camping,” the page’s description says.
UCF Athletics said they were aware of the students’ plan to camp outside the stadium. 
“But besides that, you will get in the front of the line for the student entrance come Saturday. This will be a one of kind event you will only see here at UCF!”
