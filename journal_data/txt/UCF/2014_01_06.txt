Just days after winning the school’s first BCS game against the Baylor Bears, the Knights will be looking to fill the quarterback and running back position heading into next fall.
On Monday, UCF football held a press conference to announce that Blake Bortles and Storm Johnson are declaring for the NFL draft this spring. Both Bortles and Johnson are redshirt juniors who played key roles in the Knights’ historic season en route to the Fiesta Bowl victory. Bortles passed for 3,581 yards and 25 touchdowns this season, while Johnson had 1,139 yards and 14 touchdowns on the year.
“After a lot of deliberations and talking with my parents, I’ve decided to try and pursue my goal to play in the NFL and capture my lifelong dream,” Bortles said. “I just couldn’t be more proud to say I played football at UCF, and it was the best four years of my life.”
Bortles reportedly received a first-round grade from the NFL Advisory Board. Scouts Inc. lists Bortles as the second quarterback and 15th overall prospect. To date, Daunte Culpepper is the highest drafted Knight ever, at the No.11 overall pick.
