The Big East is officially looking to expand, and according to Boston.com “it seems clear that UCF will be the first step taken by the Big East.”
The story published by Mark Blaudschun of the Boston Globe cites Big East sources familiar with the talks as saying the Big East has already “reached out to UCF as the first school in its target area for expansion.” 
The information was published in his story Monday night, which also reports that although no offer has been formally made to UCF, one is expected with in the next few days. He also reports UCF is expected to accept the offer, and that the Big East has already reached out to C-USA informing UCF’s current conference of its interest in snatching up UCF.
These media reports indicating UCF is on the verge of joining a BCS automatic qualifying conference come after USF president Judy Genshaft came under fire for allegedly trying to block UCF from the Big East, according to an Orlando Sentinel column quoting former Sen. Lee Constantine.

After reading that Mike Bianchi column, KnightNews.com conducted an exclusive interview with State House Speaker Dean Cannon — one of the most powerful lawmakers in the state — who blasted the idea of Genshaft blocking its sister university from joining the Big East. 
Genshaft had reportedly been dodging the media’s questions about whether she was blocking UCF from joining the Big East. Bianchi pointed out how it would be harder to dodge inquiries from state lawmakers. Genshaft then denied blocking UCF when confronted by a state lawmaker over the controversy which heated up after KnightNews.com’s interview with Cannon. 
Although Genshaft denied blocking UCF, she then refused to answer a St. Petersburg Times reporter’s question about whether she supports UCF getting in the Big East.
KnightNews.com is monitoring the Big East situation and will let you know as soon as we find out which teams that conference invites to join.
