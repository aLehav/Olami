UCF could see another quarterback change on Thursday if current starter Justin Holman struggles.
In Monday’s weekly press conference, UCF head coach George O’Leary said that Patti may be inserted into the game if Holman is struggling.
“If we’re struggling at all at quarterback, he’s gonna see action,” O’Leary said of Patti. “We just gotta get things going offensively. We have too many good players at certain positions that need to get the ball in their hands and we gotta get it to them quickly and do the things that we’re supposed to do.”
Holman completed six of 18 passes for 101 yards and two touchdowns last Thursday night in the 17-12 win against Houston. The previous week Holman completed six passes on 11 attempts against Bethune-Cookman for 145 yards and two touchdowns.
Holman was named the starting quarterback after completing nine of 14 passes for 204 yards in the second half in the 26-24 loss to Penn State.
Nick Patti transferred to UCF over the summer and was granted eligibility via a hardship waiver. He’s seen limited action for the Knights so far this season, completing both his pass attempts for 37 yards against Bethune-Cookman and rushing four times for nine yards.
