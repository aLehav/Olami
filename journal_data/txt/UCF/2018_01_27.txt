UCF Knights can charge around town and show school spirit with the KnightPass toll sticker. It’s black. It’s gold. And it’s available for just $18.50 plus tax at GetKnightPass.com.
 
KnightPass is a branded E-PASS sticker, launched by the Central Florida Expressway Authority in partnership with the University of Central Florida. It’s perfect for the ultimate fan who likes to save time getting around town—think traveling S.R. 408 to downtown Orlando without stopping at a toll booth. KnightPass even scores discounts on tolls.
 
Like E-PASS, KnightPass works like a prepaid phone or reloadable gift card. New customers open an account with a minimum of $10 in prepaid tolls. When the electronic toll sticker arrives in the mail, it is ready to mount to your car windshield to show your team spirit. Each time you use KnightPass on a toll road in Florida, Georgia, or North Carolina, the toll amount is deducted from the prepaid account. Customers can manage their accounts online, by phone, or in person at two local E-PASS customer service centers or three drive-up Reload Lanes in Orlando.
 
The benefits of KnightPass include:

Many professional teams were at the Reese’s, Senior Bowl this week, as well as many UCF football players. One player, in particular, seems to be all over the news.
Shaquem Griffin has been impressing everyone at the Senior Bowl. Twitter is filled with big plays like this:
I'd say @Shaquemgriffin's first pass rush rep went pretty well, vs. N.C. A&T OL Brandon Parker.#SeniorBowl pic.twitter.com/QAVojgivui

His play at the Senior Bowl is proving to the rest of the world he is more than a good story.  Shaquem Griffin is a force on the football field.
Shaquem Griffin’s great play has gotten him in a lot of conversations. If you just do a Google search of Shaquem Griffin you will see almost every team talking about his potential and how he’d fit into their defense.  Teams such as; the Cowboys, Jets, Rams, and even the SuperBowl bound Philadelphia Eagles.
It’s clear that there is a lot of interest in Shaquem Griffin, which makes it all the more baffling he has yet to be invited to the NFL combine. Most scouts are saying wonderful things about Griffin, and the ones that throw shade Griffins way get buried by UCF Twitter.
It’s great to see the world is finally realizing the talent Griffin has. UCF fans have been preaching this to the world for the past 2 years.
