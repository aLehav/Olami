It was the first day back for thousands of students at the University of Central Florida — now the second largest school in the nation and the largest in Florida. 
KnightNews.com decided to take a look at some common issues and questions surrounding the first week back to school. 
Parking
Parking is always a problem for UCF.
Last year UCF sold more than 27,000 green parking permits — while having around 12,500 parking spaces available. While not every student is on campus at the same time, it can be tough for students to find parking spaces during peak hours. 
Alex Vongchan, a junior at UCF, said his worst moment of the day was “trying to find parking.”
In order to help curb some of the strain on the first day of classes, UCF did set up an overflow lot for students to park.
 Another parking garage is currently under construction near the Academic Village. That garage is expected to open in December and have just over 1,000 spaces. 
Enrollment
According to UCF Spokesman, Chad Binette, enrollment is expected to settle in around 60,000 students. 
Meanwhile, it is becoming more challenging to be accepted to the University of Central Florida. 
“We expect the quality of freshmen to be equal to or slightly higher than last fall in terms of SAT scores (2012: 1244), GPA (2012: 3.9) and national merit scholars enrolled (2012: 241),” Binette said. “Last fall, UCF ranked 12th nationally among public institutions in enrolling freshman National Merit Scholars. Each of the universities that attracted more of these prestigious students opened its doors before 1900.”

New Students
Being a freshman at a school as big as UCF can be tough for some people.
“I had trouble finding my first class. I was the last one in and everyone stared,” said Victoria Mancuso, a freshman majoring in Music Education. “My second class had 400 students in it. I heard rumors about having big classes, and those rumors are true.”
For many students, it is a just matter of learning to work in the new environment. 
“Balance your time. Don’t do things at the last minute,” UCF junior Sarah Akram said.
Is the first day necessary?
Just how useful is the first day of school? 
Most students who have been in college a few semesters know that the first day usually means going over the class syllabus and being let out early. 
“While I wouldn’t advocate missing class, most of the day is about handing out syllabuses; still, there’s a lot of interesting information you can learn,” UCF student Chris J. Carlson said.
But sometimes, the first day is the most interesting day out of the entire semester.
“I went to my first class and my instructor was speaking entirely in German; he was using hand gestures and body language to communicate  what he was trying to say. It was awesome,” student Robert Miller said.

A UCF associate professor in the College of Sciences has recently passed away.
“The College of Sciences is sad to report Dwight C. Kiel, Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science, passed away August 8, 2013,” UCF’s College of Sciences News said.
 According to COS News, Professor Kiel joined UCF in 1990 as an Assistant Professor in the Political Science Department.  His research focused on political theory and public policy, especially in the areas of education and environmental politics.  Professor Kiel was a dedicated teacher in the department’s undergraduate and graduate programs, and he was also a core faculty member in Interdisciplinary Studies. 
“He directed the department’s graduate program for several years.  His enthusiasm for teaching and his commitment to his students were recognized with several Excellence in Teaching awards at UCF,” the COS news said. 
To honor Professor Kiel’s passion for teaching, a Dwight C. Kiel Memorial Scholarship Fund has been established. 
If you would like to make a donation, please contact Dr. Kerstin Hamann (Kerstin.Hamann@ucf.edu), Chair, Department of Political Science, or Mr. Ray Allen (Ray.Allen@ucf.edu). 



UCF students will be able to start moving into into the third new Neptune Community residence hall this afternoon, marking the completion of all the Neptune buildings.
Students moved into the two largest Neptune residence halls, buildings 157 and 158, on Saturday and Sunday while building 156 was delayed.
UCF provided temporary housing in the Towers at Knights Plaza to students in Building 156 while the building awaited completion. The school received approval to open the building for students on Sunday evening.
Students in Building 156 can pick up their Neptune room keys between noon and 4 p.m. Monday and between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday at the Hercules Activity Center, which is adjacent to the Neptune Community. If those times are not convenient, students can make other arrangements to fit their schedules.
UCF is working with a professional moving company to make students’ transition from temporary housing to the Neptune Community as easy as possible. This is an optional service provided at no cost to students.
Students who wish to stay in their temporary rooms can contact Housing and Residence Life to let UCF know they want to do that. Those students can stay in the Towers for the fall and spring semesters at the lower Neptune rental rate.
The Neptune Community will house approximately 650 students. Building 156 has approximately 200 beds.
