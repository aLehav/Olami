Former Federal Reserve banker and CEO of Godfather’s Pizza Herman Cain won the first 2012 presidential debate despite being largely unknown, based on the reaction of a Fox News focus group led by Frank Luntz.

Cain attacked Obama’s energy policy and blamed him for soaring gas prices.
“If the world market believed that we were serious about energy independence and we were going to utilize all of our existing resources, the speculators wold stop speculating up and they would speculate down until we get our own oil out of the ground,” Cain told the crowd.
