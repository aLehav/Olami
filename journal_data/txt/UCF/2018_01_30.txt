It’s official, Josh Bolona and Jad Shalhoub are officially running for Student Government President and Vice President for the second year in a row.
Since their loss to Nick Larkins and Christina Barreto last year, the two have continued to be involved on campus and make an impact. Currently, Bolona is the speaker of the Student Government Senate and Shalhoub is President of The Interfraternity Council.
These experiences have shaped these two engineering majors lives and have helped them grow as individuals, according to the duo’s post on Facebook.
“Our experience over the past year has humbled and matured us. We now have a better sense of ourselves, of our University, and of how we can better serve you,” they wrote. “We are excited to share our story with you as the campaign continues. It is our hope that we can become your President and Vice President so that we can share this positive growth with you, and so that you can join us in A New Beginning.”



It’s official, Brad Kuehler and Breon Clark, have entered the race to become Student Government President and Vice President.
The pair will be running under the slogan, “a new era.”
Currently, both Kuehler and Clark serve on SGA President Nick Larkins cabinet as the Chief of Staff and the Diversity and Outreach Coordinator respectively.
According to the duo’s website, Kuehler and Clark plan to address multiple student groups on campus individually such as freshman, veterans, upperclassman and graduate students.
Along with addressing the needs of students, Kuehler and Clark plan to cut wasteful spending by auditing SGA funded departments, eliminate paid SGA positions that are not essential, decreases the salary for certain SGA cabinet positions to free more funds, and require all A&SF Funded departments/agencies to submit an end of year line item expenditure report to the SGA Senate and A&SF Business Office.
According to the team’s announcement on Facebook, Kuehler and Clark, “aim to maintain our great progress and hold true to UCF’s values of high quality, access and diversity. With their declaration of candidacy, Brad and Breon have pledged to serve the student body and share UCF’s mission of being as diverse and inclusive as possible.”



University of Central Florida linebacker Shaquem Griffin has been invited to the NFL Combine March 2-5, 2018.
At long last, fans and professional sports celebrities have had their calls answered.
Shaquem’s brother, Shaquill, shined in the 2017 combine and was quickly drafted to the Seahawks where he has found his place in professional football. Shaquem will have no trouble following his brother’s combine spotlight in a few weeks.
Shaquem finished out his senior year with an outstanding performance in the Chick-fil-a Peach Bowl with backfield sacks and tackles made on the national stage.
Griffin left a special message for UCF fans before the announcement:
