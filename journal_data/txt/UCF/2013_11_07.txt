The student fan group known as The Gauntlet is urging fans to wear black to the homecoming football game on Saturday. According the their Facebook event page, “..They haven’t faced a team like us….A fanbase like us….They are completely IN THE DARK when it comes to the Knightmare.”
The Houston Cougars are 6-1 and currently tied with UCF atop the American Athletic Conference. If the Knights can win this game, all of the teams they face for the rest of the season already have three losses.
The game will be televised on ESPN2 and kickoff is set for 7 p.m.
