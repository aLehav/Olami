The UCF baseball team was eliminated from the American Athletic Conference tournament following Temple beating Houston 9-4 on the final day of pool play.
The Knights were tied with Houston, both with 2-1 records in pool play. Since Houston defeated UCF on Friday, Houston will advance to the AAC Championship game.
The UCF baseball team’s season hopes lies in the hands of the NCAA selection committee. The Knights will hope to keep their season alive by earning an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament next weekend.
UCF (36-23) has had key victories over no. 3 Miami, no. 4 Florida State, no. 5 Louisville (twice), and no. 12 Houston during the regular season to bolster the Knights’ NCAA tournament resume.
The NCAA Regional selection show will air at noon on Monday live on ESPNU. The Knights previously received bids to the NCAA Tournament in 2011 and 2012, with 11 total appearances in program history.
