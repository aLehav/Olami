After 33
consecutive weeks in The AP Top 25 Poll, the UCF football team is unranked in Week
7. 
The Knights have ranked in the Top 25 since Week 6 of the 2017 season ⁠— under head coach Scott Frost ⁠— and ranked 44 times in the Top 25 in history. 
The previously ranked No. 18 UCF Knights were defeated by the Cincinnati Bearcats 27-24 at Nippert Stadium in Cincinnati Friday.
The Bearcats – who were an unranked conference opponent that
had not defeated a ranked team since 2012 going into the matchup – made their
first appearance this season at No. 25 on Sunday’s Top 25 list.
