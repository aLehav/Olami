The University of Central Florida is “FTK” — For The Kids. 
This weekend UCF shattered its $820K record, raising $1,001,678.20 for charity.
For 20 hours 1,500 people danced inside the CFE arena as part of UCF’s annual “Knight-Thon,” a philanthropy that raises money for the Children’s Miracle Network. 
UCF is now only the eighth institution ever to raise over $1 million for the Children’s Miracle Network, making “Knight-Thon” a top 10 nationally ranked dance marathon.
UCF upped its charitable donation from the previous year by over $300K, where UCF raised $688,049.19 after setting a goal of $500K.
Knight-thon is UCF’s largest philanthropy, and attracts hundreds of students every year. 
UCF students are already looking forward to what next year’s donation will be.

University of Central Florida students participated in a 20-hour stand for UCF’s 20th annual Knight-Thon. 
Students collectively gathered together in hopes of raising $820,000 “for the kids,” but that goal was surpassed by $181,678.20. 
The final amount was a staggering $1,001,678.20. Money earned in this year’s Knight-Thon will go to both funds and awareness for the Greater Orlando Children’s Miracle Network hospitals. 
This donation will make UCF the eighth institution ever to break the one-million dollar mark for Children’s Miracle Network.
