Two UCF Professors recently received one of the most prestigious honors in the scientific community. The American association for advancement of science is the world’s largest multidisciplinary scientific society, perhaps most well known for their cutting edge research published in their Science family of journals.
Peter Delfyett and Ronald DeMara were honored as 2022 class of fellows for their scientific and socially notable achievements spanning their careers.
Peter Delfyett and Ronald DeMara are professors at UCF with decades long careers and numerous accomplishments and accolades ranging from the early 90’s to today.
Delfyett is the director of the Townes Laser Institute, aPegasus Professor, and university trustee chair professor of optics, electrical engineering, and physics.
DeMara is a Pegasus Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, joint faculty in the Department of Computer Science and the UCF Digital Learning Faculty fellow. 
The pair of professors were selected as 2 of 40 honorees in the engineering section of AAAS’ 2022 fellows, with 550 total individuals selected across 24 sections. Delfyett and DeMara bring the total number of current UCF leadership and faculty who are AAAS fellows to at least 16. The 2022 class of fellows will receive a certificate and a gold and blue rosette pin, representing science and engineering respectively, to commemorate the honor and will be celebrated in Washington, D.C., this summer.
