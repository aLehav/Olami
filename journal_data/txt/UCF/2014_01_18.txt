Students enrolled at the University of Central Florida may be required to have health insurance to enroll in classes in the near future, according to WFTV.
As of now, according to UCF officials who spoke to WFTV, one in five students — approximately 12,000 students — are currently uninsured. 
The proposal, being pushed by UCF leaders, would require every enrolled student to be covered with health insurance.
The UCF board of trustees could vote on this as early as April of this year, WFTV reported.
This requirement is already in effect at Florida State University, and is being looked into by the University of South Florida.
