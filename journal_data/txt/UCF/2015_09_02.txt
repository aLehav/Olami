An 8-foot-long cobra escaped its home and is currently roaming the streets of Orlando.
“The green and yellow snake, which is venomous and not native to Central Florida, escaped within the last 24 hours from a house near the 4800 block of North Apopka Vineland Road,” Greg Workman, a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman, told the Orlando Sentinel.
A search for the snake is being carried out by Florida Fish and Wildlife officials.
The Orlando Sentinel reported that the owner had a permit to keep the cobra as a pet and is an experienced pet handler.
“The snake was kept in some sort of mesh and possibly glass cage,” FWC told the Orlando Sentinel.
Do not try to capture the cobra if found. Instead, call FWC at 1-888-404-3922.
The missing cobra looks similar to the one pictured above.

The State Attorney’s Office has decided to not file charges against the Joaquin Rodrigo Mendoza in the Sigma Nu incident because the case was not suitable for prosecution due to a lack of evidence.
“We declined to file charges in the case because the evidence was not suitable for prosecution. Alcohol was involved and memories were impaired, which made it difficult to know all of the facts,” said State Attorney Spokeswoman Angela Stark. 
UCFPD has alleged the rape occurred on the night of October 2 and the early morning of October 3.
The victim did not report the incident to law enforcement until February 2015.
