The UCF Knights defeat the USF Bulls 58-46 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa on Friday, with vacancies in the starting lineup on both offense and defense. 
Despite speculation heading into the game of UCF quarterback McKenzie Milton possibly taking a few snaps — after sophomore quarterback Dillon Gabriel said that fans should “sit back and see” what happens earlier in the week — only one man saw action under center.
About an hour before kickoff, news broke that Milton would not play against the Bulls. In a quote aired on the ESPN broadcast, Milton told ESPN he isn’t yet 100%.
“I haven’t suited up all year and I don’t see the point in going out there today for sentimental reasons,” he said in the statement. “For me, I don’t want to go out there until 100 percent and playing at a high level. So there’s no rush for me to get back out there on the field. That’s been the basis of me suing up all year — am I 100 percent and right now I am not.”
UCF found its way to victory without starting senior wide receiver Marlon Williams and senior running back Otis Anderson, Jr., as well as starting redshirt junior defensive lineman Stephon Zayas.
During the postgame press conference, UCF head coach Josh Heupel said the team has the next man up mentality and guys were able to step up in their absence. 
“Otis we found out the final verdict towards the later part of the week,” Heupel said. “Marlon we knew we couldn’t have earlier in the week. Next man up mentality. Next guy comes in and makes some plays.”
After deferring the opening kickoff, UCF’s defense bent but did not break against South Florida on its opening possession. 
USF lined up on special teams acting like they were going to kick a field goal, but shifted formation and attempted a fake that was unsuccessful on the Bulls’ opening drive. 
The Knights were able to set up shop at their 25-yard line after the debacle and had a nice 15-yard run by senior running back Greg McCrae to start the game. The run moved McCrae to sixth place in UCF rushing yards after finishing the game with 130 yards.
The Knights’ offense came to a halt later in the drive as Gabriel got sacked and also threw two incompletions. 
South Florida continued to have the Knights on their heels early, averaging 7.0 yards per play on their first 16 snaps on offense. 
USF capped off the promising drive with a 23-yard touchdown pass to redshirt senior wide receiver DeVontre Dukes as the Bulls scored the first touchdown of the game.

A contested 28-yard catch by redshirt sophomore receiver Jaylon Robinson provided a much-needed spark for the Knights’ offense. UCF was able to cash in a 27-yard touchdown on third-and-2 courtesy of redshirt junior running back Bentavious Thompson.

Following a three-and-out by USF, Jaylon Robinson came roaring right back with a 42-yard reception. Within the first three drives, Robinson averaged 26.3 yards on his three catches.
Jaylon Robinson finished up the contest with five grabs for 81 yards.
A pass interference penalty toward redshirt senior wide receiver Tre Nixon helped set up a two-yard touchdown toss from Gabriel to redshirt senior tight end Jake Hescock, giving the Knights their first lead of the game, 14-7.

After putting together a competent drive, USF’s offense stalled and missed a  47-yard field goal attempt. 
UCF responded with a 51-yard deep shot to Nixon, followed by a 23-yard touchdown to redshirt senior wide receiver Jacob Harris. It took the Knights two plays to go on a 74-yard scoring drive.
The touchdown pass moved Gabriel past former UCF QB Blake Bortles for fifth all-time in passing touchdowns in school history, with 57.

UCF redshirt senior defensive back Aaron Robinson was able to recover a fumble from South Florida’s sophomore running back Kelley Joiner, qualifying for the first turnover of the game.

UCF was able to catch a break after South Florida committed a pass interference penalty that awarded them a first down by fourth-and-4, extending the Knights drive.
Four plays later on a fourth-and-2, Harris was able to score his second touchdown of the day, this time from 25-yards out. 
Gabriel’s third touchdown of the day tied his career-high of 29, which was accomplished during his true-freshman campaign last year.
USF sped up the tempo on the ensuing drive and was able to cash in a 5-yard touchdown, making it a two-possession game with 2:29 left to play in the first half. 
A 23-yard field goal by sophomore kicker Daniel Obarsky extended the Knights lead 31-14 with a few seconds left to spare before intermission. 
UCF capped off the first half of action with 306 yards of total offense.

On UCF’s opening possession of the second half, sophomore offensive lineman Lokahi Poole was flagged for fighting and ejected for the remainder of the game. 
UCF’s offense fluttered, running seven plays for just 16 yards and two punts. USF was able to capitalize and score a 3-yard rushing touchdown with USF sophomore quarterback Jordan McCloud, cutting the Bulls deficit to just 10 points.

Three plays later, UCF struck with a 47-yard touchdown to Harris for his third score of the evening, elevating the Knights’ lead 38-21.

The score broke Gabriel’s career-high, accounting for 30 touchdowns through the air this season.
The Black and Gold’s defense continued to struggle and gave up a 14-yard score. 
Despite the defense looking shaky, redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Landon Woodson stood tall totaling three sacks against USF. The last UCF defender to record three sacks in a game was Titus Davis in 2018.
When asked about his performance during the matchup, Woodson said he stuck to the game plan. 
“Well, really, it was just the game plan we came in with,” Woodson said during the postgame press conference. “Me, I just kept my head down and made plays.”

After a failed onside kick attempt by the Bulls, UCF took advantage of the favorable field position and scored on a 12-yard read-option run by Gabriel.

“Growth was exponential. He just understands defenses and what we’re doing offensively, run game, protections, we opened up some things we weren’t able to do a year ago. He has the ability to change the protections and hot routes, just a ton of growth,” Heupel said when asked about Gabriel’s season. “If you look at his numbers … pretty remarkable but the best is yet to come.”
Entering the final quarter of play, both teams combined for an offensive explosion of 991 yards. UCF gained 24 first downs, while USF picked up 31. 
USF remained committed to the running attack, tallying 200 total rushing yards before kicking a 30-yard field goal, bringing it back to a 14-point game.
An uncharacteristic interception by Gabriel instilled hope in South Florida, as the Bulls capitalized off of the turnover and cashed it in for a 1-yard score. 
The Knights only held on to a seven-point lead after the series of events.

After allowing 574 yards of offense, UCF’s defense came up big forcing their second turnover of the game. Divaad Wilson was able to make the play on the fumble recovery.
Ryan O’Keefe converted a crucial fourth-and-7 following the turnover before McCrae sprinted to the end zone on a 20-yard rush. UCF regained a two-possession lead, 52-38 following the score. 
The Knights defense rose to the occasion once again, stuffing USF on a fourth-and-1 attempt with 5:31 remaining in the game. True freshman defensive lineman Josh Celiscar was credited with the stop. 
Contrary to the lead, UCF ran up the score on their rival South Florida, as Thompson bulldozed his way across the plane for a 2-yard touchdown. 
A late touchdown by USF made the final score 58-46.
#UCF finds the end zone, but #USF responds with a score and a successful conversion — the #Knights lead 58-46 with 14 seconds remaining.
UCF evened up the all-time series against South Florida 6-6 following this matchup, with the Knights emerging victorious in the last four meetings. 
“It makes me happy. Get to keep the trophy for a whole 365 days, it stays in our building, every day we get to see it, and it’s staying here with us,” McCrae said after the victory. “It’s a lot of guys over there from my hometown that choose to go there, so it just makes me happy to brag to them for another 365.”
The Knights will finish the regular season with an overall record of 6-3, including 5-3 performance in the American Athletic Conference.
Heupel said he doesn’t think this will be the last game for the Knights when asked about UCF’s possibility of qualifying for a bowl game. 



The annual War on I-4 rivalry game renews it’s tradition on Black Friday, as the UCF Knights travel to Tampa, Florida, to take on the USF Bulls at Raymond James Stadium at 3:30 p.m. The game will be broadcast on ESPN2.
UCF head coach Josh Heupel said during a press conference earlier in the week that this rivalry game is playing for more than just an American Athletic Conference win — he said the team is playing for a trophy they have kept inside their building and looked at everyday.
“This is a game where pretty much everybody knows everybody. Played together in highschool, played against each other, been on the same seven on seven travel teams … they know the opponent they know who they’re going against, ” Heupel said. “It means a lot for everybody because you are going to live with this one and it resides here in the state …” 
Heading into the matchup, UCF has an overall record of 5-3, its most recent game being decided by just three points against No.7 Cincinnati. With last week’s loss, the Knights are currently 4-3 in AAC play. 
USF, on the other hand, has not won a game since its opening matchup against the Citadel, where the Bulls defeated the Bulldogs 27-6. The Bulls have lost their last seven straight and have not won a conference game this season.
These two teams seem to be trending in very different directions, as all three of UCF’s losses this season have been decided by a total of 11 points, while the Bulls have been outscored by their opponents by 157 points in all seven losses.
It has been 15 years since the start of the South Florida, UCF rivalry as the two teams met for the first time on Sept. 15, 2005. 
Before kickoff on Friday, South Florida leads the all-time series versus UCF 6-5, but the Knights have gone 5-2 against the Bulls since joining the AAC.
Since 2017, UCF has certainly gotten the better of USF not only in the rivalry, but as a program overall.
Following the historic 49-42 victory by UCF three years ago, the school has posted an 81% win percentage (29-7) won 2 consecutive conference titles, and played in back to back New Year’s 6 Bowl games.
 UCF has also had three Top 25 seasons within the time span. 
USF only has a 38% win percentage (13-21) and has never won an AAC championship. During the downfall, the Bulls have suffered 17 double digit losses and have not qualified for a NY6 bid.
The last time South Florida was in the Top 25 was the week before they lost to UCF in the aforementioned 2017 War on I-4 contest.
Although history is a huge part of these games, neither school should overlook one another heading into Friday.
USF ranks in the top half of the AAC in defense, even though the unit is  giving up 37.6 points per game. Despite this, South Florida has fared well against the pass and only allows 7.4 yards through the air per passing attempt. Daquan Evans has excelled this season, snagging three interceptions from the Cornerback position.
Transitioning to the offensive side of the ball, USF ranks 10 of 11 in the AAC. USF has struggled at Quarterback this season between Noah Johnson and Jordan McCloud. 
UCF’s defense has feasted on opposing offenses this season and forced 20 turnovers.  
Riche Grant and company should have a field day against a struggling South Florida team who lacks consistency on offense. Grant had a career high 16 tackles in last week’s contest versus Cincinnati. 
Despite Dillion Gabriel not having the best afternoon against Cincy, the sophomore still tossed for three touchdowns in a valiant effort against the top defense in the conference.
Gabriel ranks first in the nation with 3,017 passing yards and counting, behind only three interceptions this season. This year marks Gabriel’s consecutive season with 3,000 passing yards in just two years as a starter. 
“I believe he is one of the top 3-4 quarterbacks in college football right now,” said USF head coach Jeff Scott, when asked about Gabriel in a pre-game presser. “The biggest disappointment is when I found out he was a sophomore.”

The Knights have been fortunate enough to transition from one outstanding signal caller to another, both coming from Mililani High School in Hawaii.
McKenzie Milton is regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks in UCF school history, but has not taken a single snap since his catastrophic knee injury almost two years ago in 2018’s game against the Bulls.
Milton was medically cleared to play earlier this season, and has been practicing with UCF’s scout team. 
Heupel said Milton’s journey has been nothing short of a story of faith and the human spirit. 
“You look back at where it started, the injury on the field … At that point you were hoping he was able to keep his leg, the next hurdle was being able to walk normal and live a normal life,”  Heupel said. “Now you’re talking about him getting back on the field and competing at the highest level.” 
Heupel said there is a lot of gratitude that Milton has gotten this far in the process.
“I think it’s remarkable where it started and where it is currently,” Heupel said. “The best part of that story is that it is not done yet. The complete story hasn’t been written.”
There has been quite a bit of speculation on whether or not Milton will see the field this Friday in the same stadium where he last played football over two calendar years ago. 
“If I was a fan, I’d want to be surprised so I can’t say yes, I can’t say no,” Dillon Gabriel said in a presser. “We’ll see what happens.”

Milton’s journey has been a story of true resilience, grace, gratitude and will. ESPN’s College Gameday documented KZ’s story last weekend, and shared some of his perspective on his road to recovery.

UCF will be wearing white pegasus jerseys accompanied with black pants and corresponding black helmets. This is the fourth time in team history the Knights have charged on with this uniform combo, the most recent of which in 2019 against Temple.
UCF has now worn four different jerseys within the last five matches against South Florida.
