Universal Studios Orlando will bring in music star Lynryd Skynyrd to perform a live concert during its annual Mardi Gras weekend this Saturday, March 5. It’s part of the theme park’s Mardi Gras weekends spring concert line up — and it could be helping to fuel Orlando’s new claim to fame as the top desitination for Spring Break. 
Universal Mardi Gras Brings Concerts During Spring BreakThat’s right, according to Orbitz data, Orlando has knocked off Las Vegas as the No. 1 Spring Break destination this year. Orlando ranked No. 5 last year. Orlando’s theme parks, the Florida sun and of course all the pools and resorts in the area help make Orlando more attractive. 
Heavily advertised events like the Universal Studios Mardi Gras weekends, which is timed around Spring Break, also helps attract visitors looking to experience the Big Easy in O-town, with cajun food, parades, floats from New Orleans and the big name concerts — including OneRepublic, Sean Kingston, The Roots, The Beach Boys, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Lifehouse and Ne-Yo, to name a few.
