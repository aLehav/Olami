A statewide tax holiday will allow consumers to purchase goods for school or personal use without having to pay sales tax.
For one weekend this year, Florida will go tax free on many items necessary for students â€” including clothing, footwear, school supplies, computers and more. The tax free weekend begins Friday, August 2 and continues through Sunday, August 4. The exemption will apply no matter how many items are sold on the same invoice to a customer.
No sales tax will be collected on sales of clothing, footwear, and certain accessories selling for $75 or less per item, on certain school supplies selling for $15 or less per item, and on personal computers and certain related accessories selling for $750 or less per item, when purchased for noncommercial home or personal use. 
See the information sheet below for more on the tax free holiday and items that are tax free.
