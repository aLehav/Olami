KnightNews.com has learned what will replace Park Ave. CDs Jr. in UCF’s Student Union. 
A quick print shop will move into the empty space, which currently is serving as a temporary lounge, SGA Sen. Jeremy Tellor told KnightNews.com.
Another SGA senator, who did not leave his or her name, said the print shop “would be there for students who need to print something quick and then leave,” on the comment section of our previous story. 
According to Tellor, the shop will quickly allow students to print materials they need off a jump drive, and should never take longer than 10 or 15 minutes. 
Free printing is available on the second floor of the union at the SGA computer lab, however, long lines and waits are frequent there at peak hours. 
KnightNews.com is working to gather more information and details on this breaking story, and we’ll post them here when we do.

UCF students remembered September 11 today with a ceremony at UCF’s Reflecting Pond, sponsored by the UCF College Republicans and Student Veterans Association.
UCF’s College Republicans gathered as early as 4 a.m. to place flags in the ground to symbolize and remember those lost during the nation’s deadliest terrorist attack that happened eight years ago today.
The ceremony, called “Never Forget,” started at 8:30 a.m. and included a patriotic performance by Haggerty High School’s Elite Show Choir,  along with the presentation of the colors  by UCF’s Army ROTC.
Guest speakers reflected on the events of 9/11 at the time that they happened.
