Once the Knight had the lead on the Auburn Tigers and Loudermilk returned to the team bench area, he ran over, stood on a bench, faced the crowd, and knocked together ‘two cold ones’ to celebrate.

“I got to the locker room, checked my phone, had a few messages from family, then I saw my Instagram and Twitter blowing up,” Loudermilk said in an interview. “I saw the shout-outs which was pretty cool. It’s getting pretty annoying though because my phone won’t quit vibrating.”

“I reached out to Auburn alum Takeo on his Peach Bowl plans … and then the UCF bashing/friendly trash talk began. We made a bet on the game (straight up, no point spread) that involved posting or singing the other school’s fight song online,” Kevin Dahl said to Knight News.
Spikes posted the UCF Fight Song on Instagram Thursday while also congratulating the Knights on an undefeated season and brilliant Peach Bowl victory.
(Friendship is over in 24 hours Kev.😏) ****REPOST**** Congrats @ucf.football on an UNDEFEATED season and a brilliant @cfapeachbowl victory! @takeospikes51 a bet is a bet! The UCF fight song is: “UCF charge onto the field, with our spirit we’ll never yield. Black and Gold – Charge right through the line Victory is our cry… V-I-C-T-O-R-Y. Tonight our Knights will shine! U-C-F Knights… UCF let’s go Knights!” #peachbowl #chickfila #ucf #perfectseason
A post shared by  Takeo Spikes M.B.A (@takeospikes51) on Jan 4, 2018 at 6:34am PST

“I don’t think he even imagined UCF winning before he agreed to the terms,” Dahl continued.
“He’s about as competitive as it comes, so getting him to honor the bet publicly on social media was difficult, but he did it!”
Takeo will sing the UCF fight song on his Sky Sports show in the United Kingdom. Blake Bortles reached out to Dahl on Instagram shortly after, congratulating the alumnus on representing UCF.
“He’s catching so much flack from Auburn alumni, teammates, and fellow NFLers right now. I almost feel bad!” said Dahl.

Breaking: UCF to hold Championship Parade at Walt Disney World on Sunday

UCF defeated Auburn 34-27 at the 50th Chick-fil-a Peach Bowl on New Year’s Day, giving the Knights a perfect 13-0 season.
Athletic Director Danny White was the first from the university to officially name UCF national champions. On the field, as players celebrated, White turned toward the camera and said “National Champs. Undefeated.” and walked away.
What seemed to start as a half-joke has turned into an all-out claim that the Knights are the best football team in the country. White has announced a championship parade at Walt Disney World Sunday, national championship banners for Spectrum Stadium, championship bonuses for coaches, and more.
President John C. Hitt congratulated the team on January 2: “Our undefeated, national championship Knights are an inspiration. They battled adversity, lit up scoreboards and created a defining moment for UCF: perfection. Congratulations.”
According to the Peter Wolfe Computer Rankings, an NCAA selector, the Knights can certainly stake their claim as champions as long as they remain at No. 1.
The foundation for the title, according to White, is that a laundry list of teams has taken the title of a national champion over the previous one hundred years. From the end of WWII to 1998, only five national titles were not claimed by more than one team.
White also spoke to ESPN staff writer Andrea Adelson “on the notion that Auburn was not motivated to play in the Chick-fil-a Peach Bowl:” “Nobody’s asking the Auburns and Alabamas and Clemsons of the world, ‘Could they beat this team or that team,’ but they’re asking us to make these bold statements and then when we beat the team, there’s another excuse. There’s an incredibly biased rhetoric going on. It’s not true to sport. We don’t have it in any other sport in college, we don’t have it in any pro sport, where there’s a competitive imbalance. It doesn’t make any sense. That’s not what fans want. What’s special about college basketball is anybody can win the national championship and we need to arrive at that same place in football.”
