Mercury, a digital brand experience company, has partnered with UCF to create the new platform, ChargeOn.XYZ. The platform will give UCF fans opportunities to engage with student-athletes through special events, one-on-one conversations, signed memorabilia, and behind-the-scenes access. 
UCF Vice President and Director of Athletics Terry Mohajir said that the new interactive platform will give fans the opportunity to engage with athletes and coaches in a way that has not been done before. 
“Through our partnership with Mercury, we’re creating a dynamic, interactive experience available to every fan who wants to engage with our athletes, our coaches, and our teams, and be a part of every special moment this season like never before,” Mohajir said. 
The interactive platform is possible because of a recent NIL rule change that now allows college athletes to profit from endorsements that use their name and likeness. 
UCF starting quarterback John Rhys Plumlee said he is excited to engage with Knight fans off the field throughout the season. 
“I’ve already started working with the Mercury team to create content and interact with UCF fans in creative ways,” said Plumlee. “I’m looking forward to having fun directly with UCF fans through the ChargeOn.XYZ platform.” 
UCF fans can access the new platform ChargeOn platform by visiting chargeon.xyz or be scanning the QR code on the mural in section 101 at FBC Mortgage Stadium. The first 100 fans who register to the platform will receive a free membership pass. The full pass sale and platform launch will take place on Monday, Sept. 26.
