UCF defensive coordinator Randy Shannon’s newest contract included a $1 million annual salary and a hefty buyout, according to records obtained by Knight News.  
If UCF were to fire Shannon without cause, UCF would owe him 100% of his $1 million base salary through the term of the agreement, the records state. These terms of Shannon’s agreement had not previously been reported. 
The extension — signed by Shannon and UCF Director of Athletics Danny White in February 2020 — runs through January 2022. 
Shannon was eligible for a one-time retention bonus of $300,000 on Feb. 6, 2020, and it was to be paid on Feb. 15, 2020.  
“Eligibility for retention bonus is employee being actively engaged as Assistant Coach/ Defensive Coordinator, Football as of February 6, 2020,” the contract reads. 
“Nothing in this agreement shall be deemed to create any right, interest, or expectancy of continued employment,” the contract states. “Further, Athletics reserves the right to terminate this agreement at any time. Accordingly, Employee may be notified of termination at any time during the term of this agreement.”
Knight News obtained Shannon’s employee agreement on Tuesday. The document can be viewed here.
Shannon’s previous contract — which was from Dec. 5, 2017, through the end of the 2020 football season — listed his annual rate of pay as $300,000.
