Friends of students living at Arden Villas called KnightNews.com to alert us about a man exposing himself and apparently masturbating behind Arden Villas.
KnightNews.com has obtained the video and we have provided it below. We blacked out the obscene portions, however, at the end you can see the man buttoning his pants and walking away. Please use caution. If you know who this man is, text our tipline at 407-5-tip-ucf and also call police. 
The students caught the act on camera on separate occasions. An entire building of students with balconies facing that area is visible to the man from the spot where he was performing the lewd act. It’s not clear if the man was watching students during the act. 
A KnightNews.com review of the video concluded it is extremely offensive. As a result, only 18 seconds has been posted, instead of the entire two minute video. At one point the man even lifts his shirt over his head as he pleasures himself in broad daylight.
If you have seen this man, text our tipline at 407-5-tip-ucf. We will report other locations here. 
SPEAK OUT: Let us know what you think about the masturbating man by commenting below. 



UPDATE:  9:30 P.M. 4/21
KnightNews.com has learned new information about why Mu Sigma Upsilon is under interim suspension. The following statement is from Chad Binette in UCF’s News and Information Office:
“In late March, a parent of a student pledging Mu Sigma Upsilon sorority contacted UCF about alleged misconduct. After speaking with the parent and reviewing the allegation, UCF issued an interim suspension to the sorority.
We value the scholarship, service and enthusiasm our Greek community brings to UCF. We will conduct a thorough, timely and fair review of the allegation.”
KnightNews.com will let you know when we uncover more information about this allegation. We already have a request into UCF for more information, including whether hazing was alleged. We will let you know when we get an update. 
—-ORIGINAL STORY:
KnightNews.com checked with UCF and found out another UCF Greek organization has been suspended within the last few days — in addition to Kappa Alpha Psi.
Mu Sigma Upsilon sorority was placed on interim suspension at least until a hearing takes place. Chad Binette with UCF said he did not know whether this suspension was also related to hazing. Typically, organizations are only suspended before their hearing during severe alleged conduct violations.
KnightNews.com e-mailed that sorority for comment but has not heard back. It’s not clear if their hearing has already happened and what the outcome may have been, although we were initially told the hearing was scheduled for last week. After a hearing, it could take a couple days for a final outcome to be announced.
Below you can see what UCF said the status is of Greek Organizations as of last week. It is interesting to note that Sigma Phi Epsilon could theoretically return this summer.
“They may be eligible to return pending completion of all of the requirements they must meet,” Binette told KnightNews.com in an e-mail.
Sig Ep used to own the fraternity house UCF currently leases to Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. According to reports,  the fraternity was suspended and lost its house following allegations from Cole Streets, a pledge at the time, that brothers forced pledges to jump in a trash can filled with “crisco, cottage cheese, syrup, sardines and other ingredients.”
Streets reportedly said he suffered a severe injury during an initiation ritual where he was forced to jump over a PVC pipe and fell on his tail bone because brothers and other pledges didn’t catch him.
Here are the groups currently on suspension and/or probation:
-Beta Theta Pi (Suspension through Spring 2010, Restrictive Probation through Fall 2010, Regular Probation through Fall 2011) Restrictions are no travel and no alcohol
-Delta Phi Lambda Sorority (Probation through Summer 2010)
-Delta Tau Delta Fraternity (Restrictive Probation through Fall 2010)- Substance Free House
-Mu Sigma Upsilon (Interim Suspension)-only business meetings until hearing (last) week
-Sigma Chi (Probation through Spring 2010)
-Sigma Alpha Epsilon (Suspended through Fall 2012)
-Sigma Phi Epsilon (Suspended through Spring 2010, probation for 1 yr upon return)
-Pi Kappa Phi (Suspended through Summer 2011, probation for 1 yr upon return)
KAPPA ALPHA PSI SUSPENDED 
Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity’s UCF chapter was recently shut down following hazing allegations first uncovered by KnightNews.com, according to an update by Local6.com.
KnightNews.com was the first news source in Central Florida to break exclusive details of the anonymous call to President John Hitt’s office in September, 2009 about a pledge being severely beaten and bruised.
Local6’s website reveals more details, including allegations that the fraternity pledge was brutally beaten with canes, and that his mom reported the incident.
“He came home one night and could barely walk from the beating he received. He has bruises all over his body,” said an employee in UCF President John Hitt’s office in an e-mail, Local 6 reported.
The national office of Kappa Alpha Psi wrote a “cease and desist” order for the UCF Lambda Omega Chapter, stated Local6.com.
The letter states that all “hazing … is prohibited” and that “…the chapter is officially closed and is not authorized to conduct business or function as an entity on or off the campus of the University of Central Florida,” Local6.com is reporting.
All fraternities went on a “voluntary suspension” the day after this e-mail was received. KnightNews.com shot video of Adam Brock, the IFC VP of Public Relations at the time, who stated that it appeared that the accused fraternity was not part of the IFC group of fraternities.

Kappa Alpha Psi is part of the the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) is a collaborative organization of nine historically African American, international Greek lettered fraternities and sororities, according to Wikipedia.

Original Story Posted April 20th, 2010

After a 10-year career, Heissam Jebailey, the former co-owner of the Central Florida Future is leaving the paper he helped build behind to pursue a new career. 

After graduating in 2000 from UCF, Jebailey became a publisher of the paper in 2001 and started Knight Publishing. With the help of his business partner Brian Linden, Jebailey set forth to transform the weekly black and white tabloid with a distribution of only 10,000 into what it is today.

Under Jebailey and Linden, the Future, at its peek, transformed into a full-color broadsheet with a total distribution of 45,000 issues published three times per week. Over the past 10 years, the paper’s growth has been impressive, especially when one considers that Jebailey and Linden took over the paper with no editorial experience. In 2007, Linden and Jebailey sold the publication to Gannet Company, Inc., and Jebailey has since concentrated on the business side of the paper.

In a press release Jebailey stated, “As a former UCF student, employee and employer, I have gained invaluable experience. I feel indebted to the university and therefore want to give back to those most in need – the students.” Jebailey and the Future have done just that, donating nearly $50,000 to support scholarships and student-centric programs.

Advertising/public relations and journalism students programs have benefited from his charity, mentorship and experience. After receiving success as a co-author on a hit book “Wake Up Live the Life you Love, Living in Abundance,” Jebailey is ready to move on from the Future to promote his first book entitled, “30 Quick Tips for Success In and Out of College.”

On Wednesday, April 21, from noon to 5 p.m. Jebailey will be signing books at the UCF Bookstore located on UCF’s main campus. And on Thursday, April 22 from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m., he will be signing books inside Gray’s Bookstore located in the Publix shopping plaza on Alafaya Trail and McCullough Road.
