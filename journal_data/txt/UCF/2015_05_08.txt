Nintendo, with Universal Parks & Resorts, has announced developments to bring major attractions and entertainment, based on Nintendo’s popular games and characters, to Universal theme parks.
Universal’s parks will create “spectacular, dedicated experiences based on Nintendo’s wildly popular games, characters and worlds,” a release stated.
The agreement bridges the two popular entertainment giants, and has been long awaited, according to Nintendo president Satoru Iwata.

Now, for the first time, those stories and characters will be brought to life in entirely new ways – only at Universal theme parks,” continued the release.
