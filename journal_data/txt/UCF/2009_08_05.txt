Friends and family of the fun-loving James “JP” Saul won’t know what took him from them at the early age of 23 for at least 10 weeks, the medical examiner’s office told KnightNews.com.
“The report won’t be available for approximately 10 – 12 weeks from today’s date,” the Orange County Medical Examiner’s office wrote in an e-mail to KnightNews.com on August 4.
Rumors circulating about what caused Saul’s death are unsubstantiated because “the cause and manner of death on this case is pending at this time,” according to the ME’s office.
According to friends commenting on KnightNews.com, Saul was laid to rest Aug. 3 “on a beautiful Chicago day, in a beautiful location under a tree.”
Friends of Saul are leaving memorial messages about the popular student here on this article about his local memorial held at UCF’s reflecting pond last week.
A memorial fund has been established to help pay for Saul’s final expenses. KnightNews.com will provide a link to the Web site with more information as requested by family friends when it’s available.
