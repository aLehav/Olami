The UCF football coaching staff just made a major move that could drastically improve one of the team’s glaring weaknesses.
Class of 2023 kicker/punter Grant Reddick announced to Twitter on Saturday that he received an offer from UCF.
Reddick has a five-star rating from Kohl’s Kicking Academy and is ranked the no. 1 kicker in the country.
Director of Kohl’s Kicking Camp Jamie Kohl had many positive things to say about Reddick’s Kohl’s Camp performance on his player profile.
“Reddick’s most recent camp was in January of 2021. He scored 19 points on FG’s. In December he had a KO score of 118. Reddick had another strong performance at the 2021 Kohl’s National Scholarship Camp. He was excellent with his command of rotation and was able to score 25 points in the field goal portion of camp. He is one of the best ball strikers in his class and has the talent to be a D1 kicker!”
Reddick holds one other offer from Air Force Academy.  
In addition, the five-star has acquired interest from other powerhouse schools consisting of Alabama, Ohio State, Tennessee, Florida, and Mississippi State, according to his Twitter page.
UCF does have home-field advantage over the others, however, as Reddick attends Boone High School – just 15 miles west of UCF.
Last season, UCF went only 8-of-14 (57%) on field goal attempts, ranking the 10th-worst in the country.
If Reddick were to make a commitment to UCF, the Knights’ 2023 kicking room would likely consist of current redshirt junior placekicker Ryker Casey, freshman placekicker Colton Boomer, and Reddick.
This competitive group would almost certainly be an upgrade from what the Knights’ kicking game has contributed in recent years.
This kid can boot it from anywhere.  The tape proves it.
