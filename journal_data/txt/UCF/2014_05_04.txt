The UCF baseball team dropped its first conference series of the season, losing two of three to Houston on the road.
The no. 18 Knights (29-18, 16-5 The American) not had lost a weekend series since March 7-9 against Central Michigan. The no. 13 Cougars (35-13, 10-8 The American) still trail the Knights in the American standings and won their third straight conference series.
The Knights took an early 1-0 lead on the Cougars, but couldn’t hold on in the third inning when shortstop Tommy Williams drove in a run to give Houston a 3-1 lead.
Houston hit in two more runs in the sixth inning to give the Cougars a 5-2 lead. After that, the Knights couldn’t rally and eventually lost the game 5-2.
The Knights will next play a pair of non-conference contests against Florida Atlantic during the week. The Owls will come to Orlando to play on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., and the Knights will make a return trip to Boca Raton to play Wednesday at 6:30 p.m.
