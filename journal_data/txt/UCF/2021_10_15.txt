Former UCF standout cornerback Tay Gowan found a new home with the Philadelphia Eagles after being traded from the Arizona Cardinals on Friday.
The trade was reported by ESPN senior NFL insider Adam Schefter via Twitter.

The Cardinals sent Gowan – their 2021 sixth-round draft pick, along with their 2022 fifth-round draft pick to the Eagles in exchange for tight end Zach Ertz.
Gowan did not see the field in any of the Cardinals’ first five games of the 2021 NFL season. 
The former Knight did see action in the Cardinals’ two preseason games, however, recording a total of seven tackles — five being solo tackles, and one pass break-up.  
Gowan, who opted out of his senior season, played just one season with UCF.  The DB earned his starting spot during the Knights’ 2019-20 season-opener vs. FAMU after Knights’ original starting cornerback Brandon Moore suffered a season-ending injury.
Gowan ultimately drew the attention of NFL scouts with a standout junior season, racking up 31 tackles, eight pass break-ups, two interceptions, a tackle-for-loss, and a fumble recovery.
The former Knight will next suit up for his new team when the Eagles travel to Las Vegas, NV to take on the Raiders (3-2) on Oct. 24.  The game is scheduled to kick off 4:25 p.m. ET.
