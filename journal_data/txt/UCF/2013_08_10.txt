The University of Central Florida has issued an update regarding the newest residence halls on campus — notifying students of delayed move-in dates and the possibility of some dorms not being completed in time for the start of the Fall semester. 
Move-in days for Neptune residents will now take place on Saturday, Aug. 17, and Sunday, Aug. 18. Students can move in between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Saturday or between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Sunday. According to UCF, it is possible that one or more of the Neptune residence halls may not be ready to start the semester. 
The school says in the event some dorms are not ready, all affected students will be placed in other UCF housing as part of a contingency plan — plans which involve housing students temporarily at the Towers at Knights Plaza on campus or the new UCF-managed housing community at NorthView, located across the street from our campus’ northern edge.
“We apologize for the inconvenience that this may cause for our Neptune students and families, and we will work with students and families who have made plans to move in earlier,” UCF officials said.
Move-in hours for all other UCF residence halls remain the same: 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 14, through Saturday, Aug. 17.
“We know this is not how students and families want to begin their time at UCF, and we sincerely regret that Neptune move-in days have been delayed. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to open the Neptune community on time,” UCF officials said.
