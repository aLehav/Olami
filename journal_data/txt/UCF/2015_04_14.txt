A Valencia College student was robbed at gunpoint while on her way home from UCF Monday night. 
The student, who we’re not identifying for safety reasons, told KnightNews.com she was riding her bicycle home from a UCF comedy show around 10:45 p.m. 
She cut through Jay Blanchard Park on a bike trail around 10:45 p.m. on her way home. She said she saw three men in the distance, two had bikes and the other was on a scooter. 
The student said as she approached them, one of the men pulled out a gun and she fell off her bike. 
“When I saw the gun, I was afraid he would shoot if I kept biking, so my first reaction was to skid,” the student said. 
The men told her to give them all her stuff, and she ran to the nearest neighborhood to call for help. 
The men stole her bike, backpack, cellphone, Kindle, wallet and Chromebook 
“Having a gun pointed at you is a truly scary thing, thinking you might actually die,” the student said. “I feel more grateful for everything that I do have.”
The woman described the suspects to police as three men in their 20s. Two were black males between 5’9 and 5’11, both with short, dark hair and dark jackets. The other man was a white male between 5’5 and 5’7 with light hair and a dark hoodie. The two black males were on bikes, and the white male was riding a scooter.
She said she was riding her bike that late because she was waiting for the rain to stop before leaving shelter. 
UCF sent out an alert at around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday afternoon about the crime.
