Republican presidential front-runner Herman Cain is making new headlines — for something he did 20 years ago!

In the above video you can see Herman Cain singing about pizza to the tune of “Imagine” by John Lennon. Cain’s version is called, “Imagine There’s No Pizza.” It was done at an event during the time when he was president and CEO of Godfather’s Pizza. 
The video is gaining attention. Will it hurt Cain for being “cheesy” or show he’s a “regular guy” that voters can relate to?
