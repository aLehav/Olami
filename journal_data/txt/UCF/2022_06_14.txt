Fifteen-time major champion Tiger Woods, opens his much-anticipated new mini golf complex, PopStroke in Orlando just down the road from UCF. 
HELLO ORLANDO 👋 PopStroke Waterford Lakes is open for business!  Come & enjoy the @tgrdesignbytw designed putting courses, full-service restaurant, ice cream parlor, playground, outdoor game area and private event space.  Let’s have some fun! ⛳️#waterfordlakes #orlando pic.twitter.com/8jRQ4JTT3J
PopStroke is not like your average mini golf outing, The new complex created by Tiger Woods and his TGR team have designed two 18-hole putting courses, built entirely with synthetic turfs and they incorporate fairways, bunkers, and rough just as you would see on a traditional golf course.  
 When you make your way inside PopStroke Orlando you are greeted by tv screens, tiger woods golf memorabilia and several different options to start your experience.  
Here you will have the chance to play as much mini golf as you want for a price of 25 dollars a day and 20 dollars for UCF and Valencia students but be on the lookout for Wednesday college night because it will only cost 15 dollars with any college ID from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Seniors (60+) will also have a discount of $20 dollars with Monday being ‘Senior Night’ for only $15. 
You’ll be able to pick out your putter, one of every length and will be able to play and keep a souvenir Bridgestone golf ball just like tiger woods himself as you have to option between two different 18 courses. 
When you make your way outside, you’ll experience covered outdoor seating at three different bars with a full menu full of entrees from Mahi Mahi tacos, mac and cheese eggrolls and even a sweet heat chicken sandwich. The crispy chicken sandwich is massive, so if your hungry and don’t know what to get, this sandwich is a winner. 
You’ll be able to hangout, order drinks and even have to option play some ping pong, cornhole and foosball with a view of both courses. 
Unlike other golf facilities like TopGolf, You won’t need a reservation to play here. Tiger woods and his TGR team designed two different 18-hole mini golf courses of differing degrees of difficulty. A Tiger red course with steeper banks and undulating greens for a tougher challenge, with the black course being wheelchair accessible and a little less challenging for beginners.  
Something new that you won’t find at any other mini golf course is the ability to order drinks during your round off the PopStroke Mobile App and have it delivered to you while you play, all while never missing a moment of the big game with screens outside as you feel as if you are on a real golf course. 
Don’t forget to make your way to the Dessert bar after your round for some of Tiger Wood’s favorite handmade milkshakes along with an option of 24 different flavors of ice cream to treat yourself to after a fun filled outing. 
PopStroke is open seven days a week, 9 a.m. to midnight.

Verdict: 
While I must admit that I am a golf fan in general, I went into PopStroke with the mindset of what would a non-golf fan take out of this? The answer: So much. PopStroke offers a sure to be new hotspot for friends and business colleagues to get together, watch the game, have some good food, great options for desserts and tons of entertainment. The ability to lounge about and catch the view of the entire two courses while playing ping pong and corn hole is definitely up my alley when wanting to relax after a long day. Playing the courses can be for any age and you don’t even have to know what your doing to have a good time. With the ability to order drinks as you play all while never missing the game outside is an added bonus. The ability to save money compared to other golf entertainment complexes like TopGolf and feel like your getting more out of your experience is the deciding factor for me to make PopStroke one of the must do hangout spots when in Orlando and is one you won’t regret visiting. P.S. get the Saturday Morning Cereal Milkshake, a hidden gem.
