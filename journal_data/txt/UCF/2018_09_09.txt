Cornerback and first-round pick Mike Hughes delivered the Vikings to victory in his NFL Debut Sunday afternoon.
Hughes played most of the first half as nickel back, moving into the third quarter with an interception all the way to the house that brought the game 17-3 in favor of Minnesota. Later in the third, Kirk Cousins would make an 11-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph to make it 24-6.
San Francisco answered with a touchdown and another field goal in the third quarter. In the fourth, they would succeed on another field goal attempt but stop the scoring at 24-16.
