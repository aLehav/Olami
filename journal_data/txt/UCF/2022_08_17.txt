For the first time in school history, alcohol will now be sold to guests stadium-wide inside FBC Mortgage Stadium at UCF. 
From safety to concessions, here's everything ✨𝙣𝙚𝙬✨ coming to gamedays this season ⬇️
The UCF Athletics association took to their social media accounts on Wednesday to post a “What’s New in ‘22” guide for what students and guests can expect when attending football games at the newly named FBC Mortgage Stadium on UCF’s main campus this fall. For the first time in school history, UCF has updated its new football alcohol policy to allow alcohol to be sold stadium-wide for guests.  
Senior Associate Athletics Director, and Strategic Communications John Heisler made the announcement earlier today about UCF’s decision to expand alcohol sales from premium seating areas. 
“Alcohol has been available in premium seating areas since the opening of the stadium,” Heisler said. “This will be the first time it has been available in ALL seating areas.” 
The university added that there will be 25% more points of sale throughout the stadium to help with line lengths for patrons. 
While this may be a big change that Knight fans will be excited for, FBC Mortgage Stadium will still have restrictions on their alcohol policy at upcoming games.  
According to UCF’s new alcohol football policy,  
“Alcoholic drinks are limited to two per person per purchase, with student concession stands limited to one drink per person. Sales of said beverages at portable and permanent concession stands will end at the beginning of the fourth quarter of a football game.”  
Guests in the 3MG club section will be served alcohol until the end of the game/event held at the on-campus stadium. 
Drinks from outside FBC Mortgage stadium are prohibited and guests who attempt to bring in outside alcohol be under penalty of ejection, arrest or ticket revocation. Alcohol purchased during each game will not be allowed to be taken out of the stadium once play concludes.
