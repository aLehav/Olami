Grammy nominated hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar will be performing at the CFE Arena on April 20 as part of his most recent tour.
For fans of Kendrick Lamar, the Orlando concert is the only posted tour date he has in April on his website and is only performing in Las Vegas on May 3 before taking off for his European tour dates.
It will be second consecutive year that Kendrick Lamar has performed at the CFE Arena in April. Â In 2013, Kendrick Lamar and Steve Aoki sold out the CFE Arena in a concert that was brought by the UCF Campus Activity Board.
Tickets for the concert go on sale on Ticketmaster on March 13 at 10:00 a.m. We are working to find out what type of discount UCF students will receive for the concert.
