Game day isn’t just about tailgating and football for every UCF Knight. While student athletes are running drills and others are preparing their best black and gold attire, a different scene is occurring across campus with a more musical note. The UCF Marching Knights, Percussion, Dance Team, Majorettes, and Color Guard spend hours leading up each kickoff practicing, making sure that every step and every note are in sync. The entertainers aim to provide the full college football experience, because what’s game day without a kick-ass half-time show?

San Francisco 49ers fullback Bruce Miller was arrested after punching two hotel guests at Fisherman’s Wharf Marriot Hotel on Sunday night, according to multiple reports.
Miller reportedly attempted to check into the hotel before finding out that all rooms were occupied. The 29-year-old went to one of the occupied guest rooms and told the guest that he had the wrong room, attacking the man.
The guest’s father, 70, tried to help his son, but would also be punched by Miller, according to reports. The older gentleman reportedly suffered broken bones as a result – both guests were taken to the hospital for the injuries.
The 49ers became aware of the situation and, according to Matt Barrows of the Sacramento Bee, are currently gathering relevant facts. 
Miller’s recent action marks at least his second reported run-in with authorities, with disturbing the peace and domestic violence accusations being brought against the fullback since the beginning of the year.
