The University of Central Florida men’s basketball team will face the USF Bulls in The War on I-4 Thursday night in Tampa.
The team will be coming off of a huge 71-69 win against then No. 15 Cincinnati at CFE Arena – the fourth time ever UCF has beaten a ranked opponent.
Director of Athletics Danny White announced the official Knightmare Road Trip for students.
Buses take off at 4 p.m. for the 7 p.m. game and will return to Orlando after the game for students taking a ride back.
Free transportation, free entry, and a free boxed Chick-Fil-A lunch and drink will be provided to students who travel with their fellow Knights to see UCF play.
