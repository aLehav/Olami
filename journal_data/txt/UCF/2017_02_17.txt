Baseball is back. 
Tonight the Knights will kick off their season at home against Sienna College. First pitch will take place at 6:30 p.m.
This will be the first of a three-game home series against Siena followed by a fourth game against UNF on Tuesday.
Last year the Knights posts a 26-33 record and went 8-16 in conference play. This year they hope to turn things around after hiring new head coach Greg Lovelady. 
Lovelady was previously the head coach at Wright State, where he led the program to back-to-back runner-up finished at the NCAA Regionals. Lovelady will look to bring that success to UCF in his new era as head coach.
