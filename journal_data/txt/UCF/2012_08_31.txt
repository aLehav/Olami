While Knightnews.com covers the hard stories, we also ask the tough questions.
Which establishment makes the best burrito: Moe’s, Chipotle, or Qdoba?
On Thursday, Knightnews.com went around campus with correspondent Evan Gregory to find out what the students think. Although the video is mostly satirical, we received lots of student input that makes for quite an entertaining video.

Our final conclusion: Chipotle is the champ by popular demand, Moe’s is home to the great white queso sauce, Qdoba is convenient for on-campus students, and aliens do not eat.
