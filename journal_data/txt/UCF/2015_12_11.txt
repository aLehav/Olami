After working out with the Chicago Bears and the New England Patriots this week, former UCF receiver, J.J Worton signed with the St. Louis Rams Friday.
The 6’2” 212 pound receiver had a stellar career at UCF, he had 168 receptions for 2360 yards and 21 receiving touchdowns, before tearing his ACL during his senior season.
Worton tweeted: “Today is exactly one year from my surgery! Now I can have a much better reason to remember December 11th.”
The Rams are depleted at the receiver position and Worton may have landed in the perfect spot, for potential playing time.
