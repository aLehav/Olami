Can weed help prevent COVID-19?
According to a new study published in the “Journal of Nature Products” said researchers found that compounds in Cannabis could potentially stop the virus that creates COVID-19 from entering human cells.
Researchers from the study found two compounds that are found in hemp, Cannabigerolic acid (CBCA) and Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) can potentially prevent the infection of COVID-19 by binding up the spike proteins of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which is what the virus uses to enter cells. Researchers believe these compounds have the potential to keep COVID-19 from forming.
Even though the study did not include human test subjects, the researchers involved with Oregon State University study says these compounds have a, “long history” of safe human usage. These two compounds are found in form of hemp known as Cannabis Sativa.
Richard Van Breemen, a lead researcher in the study said that the compounds in found in Cannabis should have successful results in humans with a little more testing.
“These Cannabinoid acids are abundant in hemp and in many hemp extracts,” Breeman said. “They are not controlled substances like THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and have a good safety profile in humans.”
