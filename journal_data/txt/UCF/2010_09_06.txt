“The bicyclist was critically injured, but is expected to live,” FHP Sgt. Kim Montes told KnightNews.com. The victim was 50 years old.
Troopers don’t have any information on the suspect’s car or identity, but if you know who hit the person and left him to possibly die on the side of the road,  you can dial *FHP on your cellphone to report him.

Several UCF fraternity houses are located on Mendel Dr. Although many UCF students live on this street, many people who don’t attend UCF do too. At this point, it’s not clear whether the victim is a UCF student.
