KnightNews.com has learned that an anti-terrorism training exercise will play out in Central Florida Research Park next to the University of Central Florida main campus Wednesday, June 8 from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
According to UCF, the exercise will start at the Army Research Laboratory at 12423 Research Pkwy., continuing south along Technology Parkway and ending at Science Drive. Most of the activity, including simulated gunshots and explosions, will occur on military property on Technology Parkway.
The exercise will produce loud noises and law enforcement activity in the area, but it is only an exercise and does not constitute a real emergency. 
UCFPD and the Navy are among the agencies participating.
