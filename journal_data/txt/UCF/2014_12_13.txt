Seminal indie group Neutral Milk Hotel has announced what could be their last tour for a very long time.
Known for their classic 1998 album, In the Aeroplane over the Sea, the band has developed a legacy within the independent music community, even though they only released two records before breaking up in 1999.
Neutral Milk Hotel will be performing at the Beacham when they make their stop in Orlando, on May 5, 2015 and tickets start at $35. A complete list of dates of their 2015 tour can be found below:
