Every Winter, the University of Central Florida Student Government Association sponsors two student nights at Light Up UCF.
A partnership with CFE Arena provides students with unlimited free access to ice skating and carnival rides. A partnership with Insomnia Cookies will provide students at this year’s Light Up UCF with delicious treats, free to Knights as well.
Light Up UCF is an annual Winter event and tradition brought on campus to celebrate the holidays. From November 18 through January 7, students, staff, community members, and their families are invited to take part in ice skating, carnival rides, and holiday attractions among a decorated CFE Arena and Knights Plaza.
Each student who attends will be entered for a chance to win custom UCF scarves and “Beat the Lines” passes for Universal Knights.
Knightro will be attending.
Light Up UCF: Student Knight will last November 22 from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
