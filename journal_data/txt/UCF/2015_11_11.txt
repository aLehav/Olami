Students watched as Republican candidates came together for the parties’ fourth presidential debate at the Milwaukee Theatre in Wisconsin.

The Fox Business Network and the Wall Street Journal hosted this debate, which many conservative students were very pleased about.
“The Wall Street Journal and Fox news are both notoriously fiscally focused rather than socially focused or even focused on attacking other opponents. If you noticed at the last debate, the moderators were just giving probing questions for the other candidates to attack each other,” student Devin Haskins said.
This Debate featured the top eight Republican candidates left in the vast GOP field. The candidates were Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and Rand Paul.
Notable candidates who did not make the main debate were Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee.
During the debate, candidates traded opinions and ideas as the nation watched and made their own judgment on what transpired. 
Be sure to watch the Democratic debate on Nov. 14 and the next Republican debate on Dec. 16.
