As the images of heartbreaking death and destruction continue to pour in, KnightNews.com is dedicated to helping you help Haiti. If you or your club is doing something to help, let us know by sending us an email and we will help get the word out for you.
Here’s a list of ways that the UCF community is already helping:
WATCH HIGHLIGHTS OF UCF’S CANDLE LIGHT VIGIL | CHECK OUT THE HAITI RELIEF BBQ
-Club Kreyol is hosting a candle light vigil at 7 p.m. Friday, Jan. 15, at the Reflecting Pond on UCF’s main campus to “show support in remembrance of those who lost their lives in Haiti, those who have not been recovered and the volunteers who are now there and expected to arrive,” according to club organizers.
-Haitian Relief Effort Informational Session, Tuesday, January 19, 12:00pm, Key West Ballroom –
Do you want to help out with the relief effort for the current Haitian crisis?  Come out to join forces with UCF’s organizations as we brainstorm ideas to raise funds and donations that are badly needed.  This is an endeavor to coordinate all RSO and agency efforts into a cohesive strategy aimed at providing the maximum amount of relief for these citizens.  Bring a representative or two from your club with ideas and any information or resources you may have.  Concerned individuals are also welcome.
-The Alpha Tau Omega house is accepting supplies for Haiti. Check out the FaceBook group here.
-A barbecue fundraiser organized by Club Kreyol will be held from noon to 5 p.m. Monday, Jan. 18, at the Alpha Tau Omega house, 4419 Greek Court on UCF’s main campus. Bring a donation, and get a plate of food. All proceeds will benefit Haiti relief efforts.
-The Harris Rosen Foundation Inc. (the foundation of UCF Board of Trustees member Harris Rosen), will combine efforts with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson’s office and several local Haitian community leaders to help victims. The foundation is currently accepting monetary donations and supplies – such as antibiotics, towels, bug spray, blankets and hygiene products, but no clothes – at various locations throughout the community. Drop-off locations currently include the Rosen Centre Hotel, 9840 International Drive; First Haitian Baptist Church, 4701 Lennox Blvd.; and Child Development Center of Orlando, 11553 Winter Garden Vineland Blvd.
-The Bowl for Haiti fundraiser will start Monday, January 18 at 12:00pm, and end at 11:00pm at The Sports Arena. To see more details and RSVP, please click here.
Many UCF students have family in Haiti, and we here at KnightNews.com wish them the best, and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time.
