A source close to the UCF basketball team told KnightNews.com Marcus Jordan is planning to wear Air Jordan’s at the first Knights basketball game of the season, but he likely will wear tape over the Nike logos.
Bright House Sports Network is also reporting one of their sources is saying Jordan will wear Nike sneakers as well, although BHSN did not specify whether they heard it would be with or without tape covering the logo.
The game is agaisnt Saint Leo this Wednesday.
As we previously reported, UCF has a multi-million dollar contract with Adidas requiring all Knights to wear the Adidas shoes at games.
Jordan was promised an excpetion would be made for him, however, when he was recruited. But even though UCF was led to believe Adidas would be OK with that excpetion, execs within the the company apparently were not, and it has strained the relationship between the school and company.
After controversy erupted, some called on Jordan to wear the Adidas shoes to end  it. But according to our source, that won’t happen.
He even reportedly wore Air Jordan sneakers during the team’s Sunday scrimmage.
