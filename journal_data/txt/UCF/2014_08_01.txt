Roxy Nightclub in Orlando has closed down, according a post on the club’s website.
The club has been in operation since the 1990s, hosting everything from college night for UCF students to Takeover Tuesday featuring top EDM DJs in the Orlando-area. Upon entering the Roxy website, “closed out of business” pops up.
Along with Roxy,  Orlando nightlife establishments Bar BQ Bar, Eye Spy and Sky Sixty are closing down in the near future.
“It’s with great sadness that we announce Bar BQ Bar, Eye Spy and Sky Sixty are closing on August 31. The how’s and why’s because we know there will be questions, and are surprisingly mundane–we couldn’t come to terms with the landlord,” said Ashley Dishman on a public Facebook post.
