Pat’s Liquor Store, proprietor of www.UCFLiquorStore.com, officially has had a lawsuit filed against it by the University of Central Florida.
The liquor store which has been operating under that domain name for quite some time, was also advertising themselves as “UCF’s Official Liquor Store” on their website.
UCF claims to have sent multiple cease and desist letters to the business in late 2012 but received no response. The 19-page lawsuit, which KnightNews.com found on Domainnamewire.com was filed on March 18, 2013 for trademark dilution, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and misleading advertising.
The website reports the University has also taken issue with the liquor store’s Facebook page which uses UCF marks in multiple photos. The University’s requests include transferring the Pat’s Liquor domain name into UCF control and taking down the Facebook page.
Currently, the www.UCFLiquorStore.com says that it is off-line for maintenance. The Pat’s Liquor Facebook page is still in full operation.
