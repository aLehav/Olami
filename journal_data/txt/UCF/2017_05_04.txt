ORLANDO, Fla. — UCF Head Coach Scott Frost has been granted a two-year extension and a raise after his first full season with the Knights, signing off on a new contract on Thursday that keeps him in place through the 2021 season.
“I am thrilled to have the opportunity to continue building a winning culture and a winning football program at UCF,” Frost said. “Ashley and I feel like we have found a home in Orlando and with the UCF community.  I look forward to an extended tenure of creating a football program that matches the vision of university leadership, including President Hitt and Danny White. I thank them for their confidence and bold vision. My staff and I will endeavor to continue making Knight fans proud. Charge On!”
Frost’s original five-year deal was for a base salary of $1,700,00, but included an option for the two-year extension after a 24-month observation period. His new deal includes a bump in annual salary to $2,000,00 and a $50,000 increase to the assistant coaching salary pool.
In his first season at the helm of the Knights, Frost turned an 0-12 squad to 6-7 record and bowl game berth – retooling the program from head to toe.
“I couldn’t be more proud to work with Scott Frost as we build a nationally-competitive football program, representing UCF and our community across the country,” UCF Athletic Director Danny White said.
“In my view, the turnaround he led has been nothing short of phenomenal. To that end, we remain incredibly excited about the direction of our football program under Coach Frost’s leadership. Successful programs are built around consistency and continuity. As such, I am absolutely thrilled that Scott sees the vast potential of UCF and is committed to our bright future. ‘Orlando’s Hometown Team’ is growing quickly and it’s going to be an awesome ride!”
