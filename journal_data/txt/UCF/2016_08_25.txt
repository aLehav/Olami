On Wednesday UCFPD held its first “Coffee with a Cop” event, the first of many according to the department.
At 8am around a dozen UCF Police Officers entered McDonald’s for a chance to interact with members of the UCF community, including students, faculty, staff and residents of the surrounding community.
All members in attendance received a free cup of coffee courtesy of McDonald’s. 
One of the officers even worked the drive thru window serving breakfast orders, much to the shock of the morning customers.
“We know that there’s a growing disconnect between law enforcement in many communities”, UCF Police Chief Richard Beary said “and this is just one way to bridge that gap.”
The UCFPD plans to continue having these events, according to Beary, and the department as a whole looks forward to continue to interact with the community.

The UCF downtown campus project was projected to be opened by August 2018, but the university announced today that its plans are being pushed back by at least a couple months, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
The new campus isn’t expected to open until 2019.
“UCF Downtown is one of the largest projects in our history, and we want to ensure that our plans reflect the scope and impact it will have on Orlando,” said Thad Seymour, Jr., according to the Sentinel. “With complex and transformative projects like this, we need to make sure we get it right.”
When the new campus opens, it is expected to hold nearly 7700 Valencia and UCF students, according to the Sentinel.
