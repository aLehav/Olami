The University of Central Florida has implemented a clear bag policy on game days at Bright House Networks Stadium beginning with the first home game against South Carolina State.
The university has released a list of approved and prohibited items for Bright House Networks Stadium.
Bags approved to be taken into the stadium include:
Medically necessary items may be approved after inspection at Gate 18.
The decision has seen criticism despite recent calls for increased safety at event venues. On June 12, 2016, one-hundred-and-two club-goers fell victim to the United States’ deadliest mass shooting with forty-nine of those lives lost to the nightclub shooter.
Orlando City Soccer Club, Camping World Stadium, the Amway Center, and other venues throughout the city increased security measures after the shooting – UCF Football begins its security push with the September 3 home game against the SC State Bulldogs.
Prohibited bags include (but are not limited to):
The policy intends to provide a ‘safer environment and expedite the entry process at Knights football games,” according to UCF Athletics.
“We feel new security measures are important. The safety of our student-athletes and fans will always be our highest game-day priority. In addition, the new clear bag policy will make bag checks more efficient, speeding up the process of getting into the stadium,” UCF Vice President and Director of Athletics Danny White said.
Tailgating activities will not be affected nor will fans looking to bring binoculars, cameras, and smartphones into the stadium.
All of UCF’s game-day policies will be available by logging on to UCFGameday.com along with a FAQ regarding the clear bag policy for the upcoming season.
