President Obama will make a stop at CFE Arena in support of Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton on Friday. The event will start at 5 p.m. and the president expects an approximately 6 p.m. appearance, although traffic will be impacted much earlier.
 
Information from the University of Central Florida includes the current parking and traffic changes on campus in preparation for the president’s visit.
Parking
Some students who live in Towers 1 and 2 and park in Garage G will be required to move their vehicles to an alternate location by 7 a.m. Friday.
All floors of the east side of Garage G – the side nearest to the CFE Arena — will be unavailable for parking.
Garage F will close at 7 a.m. Friday. Vehicles left in Garage F or in the blocked portion of Garage G are subject to towing as of 7 a.m. Friday.
Students parked on the west side of Garage G will be unable to move their cars from noon to 9 p.m. due to the closure of West Plaza Drive. If you need to leave campus during that time, you should move your car to a different garage or lot before noon Friday.
Because garages C, D and H will be utilized for event parking, students and faculty and staff members are encouraged to park in a garage or lot on the other side of campus.
Closures
East Plaza Drive will close at 7 a.m. Friday.
West Plaza Drive and All Knight Study inside the CFE Arena will close at noon Friday.
Gemini Boulevard between East and West Plaza Drives will close at 1 p.m. Friday.
The roads and All Knight Study will reopen following the event, likely around 9 p.m.
