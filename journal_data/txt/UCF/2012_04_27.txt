As another round of semester finals come, and go, students continue to look for ways to cram more information in less time. Whether it is help staying awake or help focusing more, college students are always in search of the next best thing.
Adderall has become a popular, and illegal, drug of choice for many college students to help with studying for finals. But a new supplement claims to be a better, legal alternative for students who seek that “upper edge.”
ADDtabz is a new, legal, over-the-counter drug which is aimed at helping keep people focused and energized for activities such as studying for tests. The supplement is said to provide similar benefits that Adderall has such as increased focus and heightened attention, but without any of the negative side effects.
Knightnews.com had a chance to interview ADDTabz representative Dan Rudy on Friday afternoon. We were the first college news source to interview an AddTabz and found out interesting information about the product that is becoming huge on college campuses. See the interview below:
