The University of Central Florida jumped three spots to No. 13 after defeating Florida Atlantic 56-36 on Friday.

Week 4’s big winners included Michigan, Wisconsin, Miami, and BYU, in addition to UCF.
Dropped from the rankings were Oklahoma State, TCU, Texas A&M, Boston College, and Virginia Tech, who perhaps received the biggest blow to their pride: a loss at the hands of an 0-3 FCS Old Dominion 35-49.
UCF plays Pitt at home on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. Pitt lost 35-38 against UNC, who was supposed to play the Knights in week three if not for Hurricane Florence. 
The ACC adversary’s stock dropped after the loss, making it questionable for the team to claim a win for the Power 5.
