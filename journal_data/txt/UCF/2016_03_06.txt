Around 10,000 people gathered at the University of Central Florida’s CFE Arena Saturday, March 5th to show support for the republican presidential frontrunner, Donald Trump. The high-energy rally contained both supporters and protesters. The hour-long appearance included a dozen interruptions by protestors that were subsequently escorted out of the arena. Trump urged supporters to vote for him at March 14th Florida primary. “If we win Florida, believe me, it’s over folks,” Trump said.
