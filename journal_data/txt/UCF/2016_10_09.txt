The women of Delta Delta Delta at the University of Central Florida hold philanthropy events each fall and spring semester in order to raise money for St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. 
This year, the Beta Lambda chapter of Tri Delta raised over $61,000 at their annual Delta Hold’em event. 
The event took place on September 29th. The sorority turned their entire house into a casino where people could come in and play games like craps, roulette, and blackjack. 
There was also a room where a professional poker game was held and the winner received an all expense paid vacation. 
Food was provided from various vendors including Cottage Inn, Chicken Salad Chick, Burger U, Z Baked, Subway and Little Greek. 
Last year, Tri Delta at UCF raised $21,000 at this same event.
To date, $61,000 is the most money raised during a single philanthropy event by a greek organization at UCF.
Tri Delta has nationally committed to raising $60 million in just ten years to name the Tri Delta Place, a home away from home for St. Jude patients and their families.
UCF’s Tri Delt also holds their “Delta House of Pancakes” philanthropy event in order to raise money for St. Jude. 
In total, sisters of Tri Delta from around the country raised $7.9 million for the kids and St. Jude’s last year.
