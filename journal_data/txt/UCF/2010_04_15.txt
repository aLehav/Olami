UPDATE: Dante Terminello Crowned Empanada Eating Champion >> Watch Video
 
 
Ladies and gentleman, this is the culinary moment we’ve all been waiting for. Well, at least we at KnightNews.com certainly have after our creation of the famous El Corral Music Video.
This Friday, April 16, El Corral will be hosting its inaugural empanada eating contest, where contestants will eat as many empanadas as they can in the alotted time.
The first place winner will be awarded $250, along with the glory of holding the “Emapana Eating Champion” title. The contest will take place in the parking lot of El Corral, located at 3900 N. ALafaya Trail — but if you don’t already know where it is, you probably aren’t a seasoned veteran of this place.
The deadline to sign up for the competition is Friday, April 16 at 6 p.m., which is when the event starts. To read more information about the contest and to sign up, fill out the form on the El Corral Web site located here. Also, make sure to join the Facebook event page.
KnightNews.com will be covering the event, so the winner will be read about by all our viewers. Don’t miss out on this opportunity. And you aren’t the speed-eating type, definitely go to watch this contest, and grab a #1 combo while you’re out there.
Just as a heads up, El Corral will also be hosting an XBOX  FIFA Tournament the following Friday, April 23. The deadline to sign up for this is also this Friday, April 16. To find out more information and sign up, visit the El Corral Web site here.
