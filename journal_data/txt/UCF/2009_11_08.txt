Last night, UCF students poured into the arena for the T-Pain concert that kicked off homecoming week.
The opening performance was by Luke Bryan, the first country artist ever brought to a UCF Homecoming concert. With hits such as “All My Friends Say” and “Country Man,” the audience was really quite receptive and could definately be a sign to come for more country stars in the future.

 Student interviews before the concert.
