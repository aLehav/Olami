While most UCF students can’t afford to buy a ticket to Sunday’s All-Star game in Orlando’s Amway Arena, they can benefit from the extended nightlife hours — and drink until 3 a.m. 
The City of Orlando approved extending drinking hours until 3 a.m. Feb. 24-26 to give the celebrities and VIP’s an extra hour to party. And now, there’s a push to make the extra time to drink permanent. 
“You start think thinking of cities like L.A, New York and Miami which is just a few hundred miles away. Their nightlife gets going again at 12 – 1 o’clock, so it’s hard when you are going to shut it down at 2 o’clock,” a downtown nightlife representative told News 13. 
Even though downtown Orlando bars and clubs can serve drinks until 3 a.m. this weekend, the UCF bars right next to campus can’t. That’s because the change only impacts bars in the Orlando city limits. UCF and the bars near it are located in unincorporated Orange County. 
KnightNews.com will work to see if the City of Orlando will consider making the 3 a.m. alcohol cut-off extension permanent.
