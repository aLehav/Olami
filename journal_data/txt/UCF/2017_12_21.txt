The 50th anniversary of the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl has sold out for the New Year’s Day matchup of the No. 12 University of Central Florida and No. 7 Auburn University.
The brand-new Mercedes-Benz Stadium has a capacity of up to 80,000 people. UCF was eager to fill their ticket orders by clearing 12,500 university-allotted tickets in less than 24-hours, the fastest of any similar institution.
“I can’t think of a better way to celebrate our 50th Anniversary than with a top-12 matchup in front of a packed house on New Year’s Day,” said Gary Stokan, Peach Bowl, Inc. CEO and president. “We’re looking forward to starting 2018 off by welcoming more than 70,000 UCF and Auburn fans to Atlanta.”
The perfect Knights will see the Peach Bowl for the first time and a New Year’s Six bowl for the second, traveling to Phoenix for the 2014 Fiesta Bowl.
“Between this year’s Chick-fil-A Kickoff Games and Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, we’re a perfect three for three in selling out the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium,” said Percy Vaughn, Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl chairman. “It’s a testament to the caliber of the games we’ve been able to host, and the passion of the college football fans we have here in Atlanta.”
The 50th Chick-Fil-A Peach bowl will be played at 12:30 p.m., New Year’s Day in Atlanta and televised nationally on ESPN.
