Knights, your chariot awaits! 
SGA and Lyft have again partnered to offer promo codes for students to use around the surrounding UCF area this fall. 
The partnership, which is coined as the “safe ride program”, affords students two rides per month in the surrounding UCF area on Friday and Saturday nights from 8:00 p.m. to  3:00 a.m. with a $7.50 per ride credit.
In order to apply the code, the ride must begin and end within the highlighted zone, which goes as far north as Oviedo and as far south as Waterford Lakes.  
According to SGA, students must have paid the Activity & Service Fee in order to apply the promo code.
Each month will bring a different promo code during the fall semester. 
The promo code for the month of September is SGASEP19 — the following month’s code can be found here.
