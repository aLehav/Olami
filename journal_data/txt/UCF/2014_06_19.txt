UCF and Osceola County are in the preliminary stages of building a $61 million “smart sensors” research center that could bring thousands of tech jobs to Central Florida.
The news was announced on Monday night and the facility is under the working name of Florida Advanced Manufacturing Research Center.
“This center holds great potential for becoming another economic game changer for our entire region – and the timing for such an endeavor could hardly be better,” UCF President John Hitt said in a news release.
Osceola County will provide 20-acres of land for the project at the Judge Farm’s property near the Florida Turnpike. UCF pledged $10 million towards the construction of the projected 100,000 square foot complex.
The smart sensors market is expected to reach $7.8 billion by next year, according to Global Industry Analysts Inc.
“This is a historic day for Osceola County. Partnering with the University of Central Florida as the home of a research facility of this significance ties into all the planning and work we’ve done to diversify our economy,” said Osceola Commission Chairman Fred Hawkins, Jr. in a news release. “Creating these types of 21st Century jobs will make us a world leader in this coveted and competitive hi-tech field.”
