UCF baseball will host the No. 2 Florida State Seminoles on Tuesday and Wednesday as they look to get back on track after snapping a 7-game losing streak against Central Michigan on Sunday. 
Florida State will have the Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston on the active roster for both games. Winston is hitting .250 on the season and has three strikeouts in six innings pitched. The Seminoles (12-2) are the highest ranked opponents to come to UCF since No. 1 Rice came to town in 2006.
RHP Peter Miller, who was drafted in 2013 by the Dodgers, will take the mound against the Knights on Tuesday. If the Knights want to beat the No. 2 ranked team in the nation, they will rely heavily on junior first baseman James Vasquez who is hitting .333 with 12 RBIs on the season. 
UCF will have Tanner Olson on the mound, who is making his second-career start. Olson allowed just two hits and no earned runs in his 4.2 innings in his first start.
Tuesday’s first pitch will be at 6:30 p.m. and Wednesday’s first pitch will be a 4 p.m. Tickets are limited for the first game, with 500 tickets remaining UCF is urging fans to purchase tickets early at (407) UCF-1000.
