On April 6th, this past Thursday, UCF joined other Florida public Universities in banning the app TikTok on its networks and removing the application from all school devices. 
An email was sent to UCF students and staff on April 6th which included the following: 
“Experts and research have recently pointed to the possibility that foreign governments may use certain social media apps, websites and platforms to collect user data and personal identifiers; exert influence over the recommendation algorithm; and compromise devices. Due to these security concerns, the Florida Board of Governors issued an emergency regulation that requires all of Florida’s public universities to comply with the State University System’s Prohibited Technologies List. To comply with the regulation, UCF will block access to the listed social media apps, websites and platforms deemed to threaten privacy and data security.”
