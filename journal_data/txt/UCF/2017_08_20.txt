Knight News has launched a Twitter account that tweets out the number of open parking spots for student commuters beginning this Fall semester.
Instead of guessing which garage to park in ahead of your class, whether you’re running late or want to park close to your class, you can check the account for the most updated numbers for on-campus garages.
The account – UCFTraffic – neatly and reliably displays the number of open parking spots for Garages A, B, C, D, H, I, and Libra every 15 minutes.
