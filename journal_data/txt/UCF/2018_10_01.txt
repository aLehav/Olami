UCF Football has been steadily moving toward being a top-ten team.
The Knights dismantled the ACC’s Pitt in Spectrum Stadium 45-14. McKenzie Milton earned AAC player of the week honors after his stellar performance on the field Saturday, which, unsurprisingly, made Milton and crew only content at best.
After getting stuffed at the line by the Pitt defense on a QB keeper, Milton ran for try two against the D-line and made a stretch for the end zone for six points and his 71st career touchdown (responsible for).
The career milestone tied 4th in UCF Football with alumnus Blake Bortes, the only other quarterback to lead the team to a New Year’s Six bowl aside from Milton. McKenzie soon broke that record to become 4th all-time in passing touchdowns.

Southern Methodist University (2-3) will travel from Dallas to Orlando to face the Knights in another conference matchup. Last time around, the Knights defeated SMU 31-24 in a nailbiting game – the Mustangs held an undefeated streak at home that UCF reset. At 6-2 in November 2017, a loss for UCF would have halted their championship run.
