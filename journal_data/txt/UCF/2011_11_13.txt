The Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity hosted its annual “Watermelon Bust” philanthropy this past weekend.
The contest was held this past Saturday at Memory Mall and has so far raised 40,000 pounds of food for the North American Food Drive.
According to the event’s Facebook group, “the sorority with the most amount of food raised and donated along with total points will win Watermelon Bust and will be selected to have Pirate WEEK with Lambda Chi in the spring.”
The overall winner of the event was the Alpha Delta Pi sorority, followed by Kappa Kappa Gamma and Zeta Tau Alpha.
The event was sponsored by local organizations, including satirical DC website thewashingtonfancy.com.



The Alpha Tau Omega fraternity hosted its annual “Rock the Wreath” concert this past weekend, raising $11,000 for the Children’s Miracle Network.
The event was held at the ATO house in Greek Park and featured the artists Shwayze and Cisco Adler.
Rock the Wreath started in 2004, and since then has raised over $60,000 for the Children’s Miracle Network in Central Florida.
It has brought artists in the past like Hawthorne Heights, Mayday Parade, Between the Trees, Gym Class Heroes, We the Kings and Big Sean.
