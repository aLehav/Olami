The Orange County Sheriff’s Office has admitted their tweet sent Thursday night about no “credible” reports of shots fired near the University of Central Florida was incorrect and a gunman is still on the loose. 
KnightNews.com broke this story after students reported hearing gunfire on Khayyam Avenue around 8:00 p.m. and were afraid. 
Multiple students said they saw the gunman and heard the gunfire. Deputies even reported finding a shell casing near Phi Delta Theta’s off-campus fraternity house.
Orange County Sheriff’s Office sent a tweet at 9:45 p.m. stating that there was “no credible report” of shots fired near UCF.
Since that tweet, Local 6 and KnightNews.com continued to ask officials at OCSO why the tweet was sent after numerous eye witnesses came forward. 
KnightNews.com has learned an internal investigation at the Orange County Sheriff’s Office found that there was a credible report of shots fired and even a potential victim. 
“The tweet was incorrect. In fact  multiple patrol deputies arrived on scene and interviewed witnesses. There was a potential victim who declined to prosecute and a witness who gave testimony as to what he saw,” OSCO spokesman Jeff Williamson said. “Shell casings were recovered at the scene and the case is open and ongoing.”
