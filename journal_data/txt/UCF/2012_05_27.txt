UCF’s Daytona Beach campus is under a tropical storm warning right now, thanks to the track of Tropical Storm Beryl. 
The storm had 70 mph winds and was poised to make landfall in Jacksonville Sunday night, according to the 8 p.m. Sunday advisory from the National Hurricane Center. The storm was upgraded to a tropical storm after previously being only a subtropical storm. It has so far failed to reach hurricane strength. 
The tropical storm warning extended all the way from portions of South Carolina and stopped at the Volusia/Brevard County line. UCF’s main campus was not within the warning, so Tropical Storm conditions are not expected; however rain and wind still hit the main UCF area Sunday.
The track of these storms can change, so KnightNews.com has posted the latest track and information from the National Hurricane Center below. Keep checking back to see the latest track.
