After a breakout sophomore year, 6-foot-0 guard Brandon Goodwin has decided he will transfer, according to collegebasketballtalk.nbcsports.com.
Goodwin was one of UCF’s best scorers this year averaging 10.2 points per game. He also added 4.2 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game.
Goodwin’s biggest game for UCF was perhaps this year against the University of Houston. Goodwin finished with 30 points and hit two big 3 point shots. One to force overtime, and one to win the game in the extra period.
NCAA rules will require Goodwin to sit out one year after he transfers. Goodwin thanked his fans and coaches Sunday afternoon on Twitter. 
Goodwin was arrested on April 27 on campus outside of the CFE Arena by UCFPD for stealing a bike owned by UCF. However, he pleaded not guilty and the case is still pending. 
It’s unclear why Goodwin has decided to transfer. No one has released a reason for his actions just yet.
