After a week long battle for her life, UCF student and sister of Kappa Delta Brooke Dawkins has been declared clinically brain dead by doctors, according to her brother.
“Doctors will continue to give her as much treatment as they can but saving her vital organs will soon become a priority,” Brody Dawkins, Brooke’s brother posted on her support page. “Father Roland is here to deliver her last rites with our family at the bedside in preparation for her journey into God’s kingdom.”
Dawkins was involved in an accident on Feb. 23 when she walked out into the path of a Toyota Pickup truck at the intersection of Alafaya Trail and Gemini Blvd. She has been at Orlando Regional Medical Center in critical condition since the accident. 
“Clinically, Brooke is brain dead. Legally, she is not to that point yet. Over the next hours and days we will be with her and we will continue to receive information necessary to make the best decision for her as possible,” Dawkins said.
Students, friends and the UCF community have been reaching out and supporting Brooke and her family from the beginning — even raising money to help pay for medical bills.
“We appreciate the support but we ask that only close family and friends be at the hospital today. Never stop praying for our Brooke,” Dawkins said.
