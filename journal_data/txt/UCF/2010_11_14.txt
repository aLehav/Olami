Update:The winner overall was Sara Levanti and the winner of the “Knight News Fan Favorite” was Jackie Montanari of Kappa Alpha Theta!
This coming Tuesday, November 16 at 7:00 p.m., Delta Tau Delta will host its second annual Miss Greek competition, which is its yearly philanthropy set to benefit the American Cancer Society and the Florida Blood Center.
Miss Greek is more than a social gathering, more than a talent show and certainly more than a beauty contest. This is an event that combines the hard work and dedication of the extremely talented women who participate into a way to not only raise thousands of dollars for charitable organizations, but to bring the Greek community together and support one another in their efforts to showcase what Greek life is all about: community.
This year’s competition is amongst five young women vying for the prestigious title of Miss Greek 2010. The show is split into different sections that will be judged, which ultimately decides the competition’s winner.
In addition to the formal judging process, as an official sponsor of the competition, KnightNews.com will be hosting the “KnightNews.com Fan Favorite” award. Below, we have posted a picture and short bio of each of the participants. To vote for your favorite contestant, simply go to the appropriate contestant’s page, and click on the “like” button right above the story.
The contestant with the most likes on her page will be the winner of the KnightNews.com fan favorite award, and will win a scholarship that will be presented during the award ceremony of Miss Greek 2010.
