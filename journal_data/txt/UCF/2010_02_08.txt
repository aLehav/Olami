UPDATE 9:00 PM: 
Orange County sheriff’s investigators say the gunman fatally shot the
woman, who is an AT&T employee, in the head as she walked to work. The
victim was walking into the building when the confrontation occurred
in the parking lot. The shooter then turned the gun on himself,
committing suicide.

It is unknown what their relationship is. Officials say the victim is
married, but not to the shooter. Witnesses on the scene explained that
they heard multiple gunshots.
The victim was transported to Florida Hospital East. In addition,
officials say the woman was in critical condition until she succumbed
to her wounds a few hours later.
Although the shooting happened near AT&T, Research Park holds many UCF
offices. A release on UCF’s Web site indicates that no UCF students,
faculty or staff were involved in the shooting.
KnightNews.com is working with officials to get more information, and
we will post updates as we get them.



Firefighters and UCF police swarmed Pegasus Landing just a couple hours after the Super Bowl ended. 
Students evacuated the UCF area apartments, but no visible signs of smoke or fire were apparent from the outside. 
Residents who evacuated the building told KnightNews.com crews someone just pulled the alarm. 
It is not yet clear what time residents were allowed back inside the buildings.
