For the first time in at least five years, UCF SGA impeachment witness interviews will be open to the public.
According to Chad Binette, a UCF spokesperson, “Any interviews conducted would be part of LJR committee meetings, and no meetings have been scheduled at this time.” 
LJR committee meetings are open to the public. Binette said no interviews had been conducted yet and that he’d keep KnightNews.com updated “as any meetings are scheduled.” 
In the past, SGA allowed LJR members to gather behind closed doors — outside of the regular public committee meetings — to conduct witness interviews. SGA statutes claimed the closed witness interviews were allowed under an exception to the Sunshine Law for “fact-finding” missions. However, as KnightNews.com reported yesterday, lawyers disagreed that the exception applied.
