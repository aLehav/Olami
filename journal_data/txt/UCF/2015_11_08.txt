Update 4:30 a.m.: The incident was a false alarm, according to Furnas.
The University of Central Florida Police Department and Orange County Fire Rescue responded to an alarm at the CREOL building early Sunday morning.
The following UCF alert was sent out at around 2:42 a.m.:
*UCF ALERT* ORANGE COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT ON SCENE AT THE CREOL BUILDING. PLEASE STAY CLEAR OF THE AREA. *UCF ALERT*
Sargent Woody Furnas with UCFPD said the crew on scene is gearing up in Hazmat suits. He also said there is the possibility this is a false alarm.
“In the past there’s been like some water condensation in the lines which gives a false reading,” Furnas said.
This is a breaking story. Check back for updates.
