This week, the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority hosted its “Fiesta de C.A.S.A.” fundraiser for C.A.S.A., which stands for Court Appointed Special Advocates. 
Theta transformed its sorority house into a Latin-themed dinner hall with music, drinks and food — even including matzah for those celebrating Passover. There was a buffet station with make-your-own tacos, and visitors could quench their thirst with lemonade — dubbed “Theta-rade” –or by sampling Crunk Energy Drink, one of their sponsoring companies.

Tickets to the dinner were $7, with all proceeds going to C.A.S.A., in addition to money raised by selling raffle tickets for prizes that were donated, such as gift cards, a hand bag and free Sea World tickets.
