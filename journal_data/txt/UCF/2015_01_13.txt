UCF-area gas is continuing to drop and students get to reap the benefits.
Gas at the Wawa and RaceTrac dropped to $1.99 a gallon on Tuesday, well below the Florida state average of $2.21 per gallon.

Overall, the national average is $2.11 per gallon and gas has dropped for over 100 straight days.
“The national average currently stands at its lowest since May 9, 2009, a date that saw 8.9% unemployment and Phil Jackson coaching the Los Angeles Lakers toward the NBA title,” said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst with GasBuddy in a release.
KnightNews.com will continue to monitor UCF-area gas prices.



Trevor Colbourn, the man who gave the University of Central Florida its name, has died.
Colbourn, UCF’s second president, died Monday in Winter Park at the age of 87. 
In 1978, Colbourn recognized that Florida Technological University had outgrown its name and helped the newly named University of Central Florida establish an honors program and a football program.
“Trevor blazed trails for UCF, from giving us our name to the leap of faith that led to a nationally prominent football program,” said UCF President John C. Hitt in a release. “He was an astute academic leader with a keen vision. As president, I greatly valued his advice and contributions to our university.”
Known as the “Scholar President,” Colbourn held degrees from the University of London, the College of William and Mary, and Johns Hopkins University. 
In 2001, the Humanities and Fine Arts Building was renamed Colbourn Hall in honor of Trevor Colbourn. 



In a post-season filled with questionable rulings, narrow victories and underdog comebacks, we now have only the conference championships to look forward to before Super Bowl Sunday is upon us once more. 
This weekend featured two of the closest games of the season along with a surprise upset, as the Indianapolis Colts prevented the Denver Broncos from another Super Bowl appearance, and a last minute slaughter when the Seattle Seahawks put the Carolina Panthers back in their place.
The weekend began with the Baltimore Ravens heading to Foxboro to face the New England Patriots in a game that was decided by an interception thrown by Joe Flacco in the last two minutes of the game, cinching the Patriots’ advancement, with a final score of 31-35.
The second game of the night featured a team no one expected to make it past the first round, the Carolina Panthers, who took on last year’s Super Bowl champions, the Seattle Seahawks. Considering the fact that the Panthers were unable to even break the .500 barrier during the regular season, it was a shock to see them attain any success in the post-season. Unfortunately, it was impossible for them to keep that momentum going, as the Seahawks managed to dominate in the final, for a game ending score of 31-17.
Sunday began with a game that made up for last week’s highly questionable calls. 
When the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, many cried foul over some of the referees’ rulings. Well after the Cowboys loss to the Green Bay Packers, it seems balance has been restored to the universe. Green Bay’s victory was heavily dependent on a few decisions by the officials, which many saw as debatable.  One skeptical call would have placed the Cowboys on the Packers’ 1-yard line, but instead led to a change of possession and the Packers’ victory.
The final game of the week featured one of professional football’s most impressive quarterbacks once again deteriorate under pressure. Hoping to make it back to the Super Bowl once more, the Denver Broncos hosted the Indianapolis Colts, ending the game with a discouraging loss of 24-13. 
After last year’s abysmal Super Bowl appearance, some feared that Broncos’ quarterback Peyton Manning might prove unable to lead the team when it really counts. Sadly, those fears came to fruition, as Manning was unable to put up more than one touchdown and 211 yards, making it one of his most disappointing games given the stakes.
Next Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks will host the Green Bay Packers at 3:05 P.M., while the Indianapolis Colts will head to New England to face the Patriots at 6:40 P.M.

New year means new resolutions and more Knights wanting to get in better shape.
Getting fit is not an easy thing to do and more often than not those healthy resolutions are gone after a couple of failed gym attempts.
KnightNews.com wants to remind you that becoming a better you doesn’t always have to be a drag and the UCF Recreation and Wellness Center is here to help with their group exercise classes.
The UCF RWC offers many group exercise classes to help fellow Knights get in shape. It’s a fun spin on a typical workout.
According to the official UCF RWC Website, “various formats offered include but are not limited to: resistance training, mind/body, cardiovascular endurance, plyometrics, and spinning.”
Don’t feel like running on the boring cardio machines? Try taking Hip-Hop Cardio instead.
Running tight on time and need a fast workout? an Express Spin class is the perfect solution.
Some classes offered are Hot Yoga, Kickboxing, and Zumba, but there are many more. With so many to choose from, there is a class for everyone. For a complete list of classes and descriptions, click here.
Online registration for the classes begins 24 hours before their start time. Students must log in with their myRWC barcode (PID without the letter) and account pin (birthday in the YYMMDD format).
Students must arrive 15 minutes before their class starts to lock in their spot. Walk-ins are welcome, but are not guaranteed admission.
Students looking to get a good work out should really take advantage of these classes. They are also great for those who are new to the gym and do not know where to begin. Group exercise makes getting in shape and keeping a New Year’s resolution a little more enjoyable.
For a full list of classes make sure to check out the official group exercise schedule.



Dill pickle, buffalo, and black bean— these are the disruptive, inventive flavors the “hummus rebel,” also known as UCF student Jesse Wolfe, CEO of O’Dang Hummus, created that could be sitting on the shelves of some major grocery stores soon.
After taking third place in the Joust, the UCF College of Business Administration’s Business Plan Competition, Wolfe was selling his hummus at Lake Eola and other farmer’s markets, making 300 tubs of hummus a week.
Roughly eight months since he started O’Dang Hummus, Wolfe’s business has dramatically progressed.
We first told you about Wolfe and O’Dang Hummus in September of 2014. A little over a month later, Wolfe placed second in Blackstone’s  first LaunchPad Demo Day in New York City, winning $15,000.
“UCF has done so much for us,” Wolfe said. “From the start, the one thing everyone needs to know that Blackstone Launchpad isn’t out to steal your ideas or take part of your company. In return, the school gets huge recognition. Four teams out of 20 were from UCF.”
The Blackstone Launchpad is a student-serving organization that is supported by The Blackstone Charitable Foundation, which seeks to support innovative projects and catalytic ideas that can accelerate start-ups, job growth and economic activity.
“I would say I received $150,000, if I had to put a price on it, in help with free legal advice, referrals, and countless introductions to important, crucial people,” Wolfe said. “When it came to my accounting needs, they referred me to someone. They don’t take any of your patent. It’s literally an incubator to help you. From the moment you walk in, you time stamp your idea. Everything is confidential.”
Wolfe was also featured twice on Fox35’s Good Morning Orlando. While on the show, Wolfe met the owner of The Meat House in Winter Park. Just a few months later, the product now sits on the shelves at The Meat House with the new labels his team created.
“You set yourself up three to five years [for your business plan]. Our year one is out the window. We’ve grown much faster than we projected. We are past the introductory phase we planned for Jan. 1,” Wolfe said.
When asked about the future plans for O’Dang Hummus being in other stores, Wolfe said he couldn’t reveal the names of the stores because the contracts still have to be finalized, but he discussed his plan to dominate the hummus industry of Orlando.
“We have one of our final meetings next Wednesday. We are waiting to finalize, but we have interest in three, large national chains. All we really need is one of those. If all goes through, it would be located in the Dr. Phillips area.  The next chain will put us in all of Orlando,” Wolfe said.
He doesn’t want to stop there.
“Our business plan isn’t to build a giant facility, instead utilize smaller facilities across the country. It would be easier for us to allow Amazon to fulfill it. We want to be the first hummus business through Amazon,” Wolfe said.
He still plans to launch his to-go pack and a website, which he says will be ready in a couple of months. He also says that his crazy flavors have no end.
“We have a bacon hummus and garlic-Parmesan flavor. Brownie batter dip, which is a black bean dip that taste like brownie batter. We beta tested it two weeks ago and it went very well.”
As Wolfe’s business plan and flavors are growing, he still plans to be a contestant on ABC’s “Shark Tank” in the near future.



UCF All-American Second Team cornerback Jacoby Glenn will enter the 2015 NFL Draft, Glenn announced on his Instagram Tuesday morning.
“I want to take the time to thank George O’Leary and tell my UCF Knight’s family that I enjoyed my time at the school and especially enjoyed playing for you guys,” Glenn posted. “I wish everybody the best on success, but it’s time to take my talent to the next level.”
Glenn, a redshirt sophomore, is coming off of one of the most spectacular seasons ever by a UCF cornerback. This past season he ranked third in the nation with seven interceptions and third with 18 passes defended. He was one of 50 student-athletes to be named to either the AP All-American First or Second teams and was just one of 13 underclassmen named to the list. 
UCF has seen turbulent coaching changes so far this off-season, former DB coach Kirk Callahan left for Florida, former offensive coordinator Charlie Taaffe retired and former defensive coordinator Tyson Summers left for Colorado State.
Junior wide receiver Breshad Perriman also declared early for the NFL draft. 
Glenn finishes his UCF career sixth in program history with nine interceptions.
