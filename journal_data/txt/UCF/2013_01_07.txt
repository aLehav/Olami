UPDATE: The victims in this case have been identified as Vincent Cruz (10/20/92) and Antwon Ollins (12/20/93). Both victims are students at Valencia College.
UCFPD also say there is currently no threat to the UCF campus.

A double shooting near UCF has rocked students and residents on the first day of Spring classes.
A shooting at Campus Crossing Apartments occurred around 6 p.m. Monday evening near UCF’s main campus and left two males with gunshot wounds, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. Both victims drove themselves outside of the complex, where Deputies were able to make contact with them and have Orange County Fire Rescue respond. The victims were transported to the Orlando Regional Medical Center and their injuries appear non-life threatening at this time. We are unsure if the victims were UCF students at this time.
UCF sent out an emergency message to all students:
UCF ALERT * Police still searching for suspects in the Campus Crossings Alafaya Apartment area.
Residents of Campus Crossing can get in at the Lokanotosa entrance only on foot–no cars are being allowed into apartment complex at this time. 
The Orange County Sheriff’s Office is currently investigating the situation and asks anyone with information regarding this incident to call CRIMELINE.
