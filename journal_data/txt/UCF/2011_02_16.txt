UCF’s Muslim Student’s Association has kicked started Islam Awareness Month (IAM) on campus this week. On Monday, the MSA Knights had the podium outside Student Union, where they had an Imam available to answer questions, offered information, cookies, crackers and free henna tattooing for the ladies, made the call to the noon prayer in Arabic and English, and even prayed outside Student Union on the lawn. 
Naseer Richards, an avid MSA supporter held up the MSA tent as the gusty wind blew outside Student Union. “I am here because I’m trying to help clear misconceptions about Islam. I am trying to help other people who are non-Muslim realize that Islam is not as it may appear on TV. I myself am a convert so I saw from the outside what a lot of people might see. People today have picked up the Qur’an and honestly want to read it because of what we’ve spoken to them about. I’m trying to help show others exactly what Muslims really are about. It’s very enlightening and it’s very heartening because when you honestly get to see what these people are saying and why they feel the way they feel and when you address these concerns and tell them what’s actually in the Qur’an and what we actually worship, and how we worship then they really get intrigued and they really want to learn. So it’s definitely been helping a lot of people I would say.”
I spoke to MSA Communications Director Mehreen Parvez at the IAM kickoff, who says this month is much more than the bi-weekly outreach table the MSA hosts outside Student Union on Monday and Tuesday mornings to inform people about Islam.  She says that it’s about a lot more events like Comedy Night, Women’s Soiree and special speakers who are invited to speak at several events this month and that there’s something for everyone, whether they’re seeking fun, culture or knowledge about Islam. All IAM events are free for all to attend but collections of canned food for the local needy are greatly appreciated.
