The UCF Police Department has made an arrest following a sexual battery that took place at an off-campus student housing complex early the morning of Nov. 16, according to UCFPD spokeswoman Courtney Gilmartin.
UCFPD arrested Edward Santana Thorpe on a warrant just before midnight on the night of December 25 at the Knight’s Circle apartment complex, where the crime happened, according to UCFPD.
UCFPD confirmed that the suspect has no UCF affiliation and is not a resident of the Knight’s Circle apartment complex.
It’s not clear why the suspect frequents the UCF affiliated housing complex the university promotes to students.
The victim of the crime, a minor with no UCF affiliation, and her female friend met with Thorpe on November 16 near Alafaya Trail and McCulloch Road and voluntarily hopped a wall with him to enter the complex, according to UCFPD.

The crime was reported later that morning and a UCF alert was sent out to students that day, according to UCFPD.
A warrant for Thorpe’s arrest was issued earlier during the week, and he was arrested without incident by UCFPD’s Patrol Division.
UCFPD said that they will be handing reports over to the State Attorney’s office for further action.



UCF students can now live on campus, tan on campus, or tan between classes.
The South Beach Tanning Company will be opening on UCF’s campus at the Knight’s Plaza this upcoming spring semester.
This will be the company’s third location serving the UCF area. Other locations are in Waterford Lakes and at University Plaza. 
According to the company’s Facebook page, students can start tanning for just $9.99 per month.
The company is also currently offering a promotion that allows students to tan free for the rest of the calendar year.
