Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said five citations and 11 warnings have been issued to businesses found to be out of compliance with the new COVID-19 executive order. 
“This, however, does represent just a small fraction of our county businesses that have been out of compliance,” Demings said during a Thursday press conference. 
Demings signed the executive order on Dec. 4 and it went into effect on Sunday.
The order requires a business to ensure both employees and customers wear face coverings, to encourage telework or allow a rotation schedule for employees, to monitor its checkout points and staging areas for social distancing requirements by floor markings or similar actions, and to post appropriate signage throughout each physical location. 
Orange County’s Business Compliance, or strike teams, are responsible for visiting businesses and helping them achieve COVID-19 compliance through the implementation of proper workplace guidelines and procedures, the website states. 
During Thursday’s press conference, Demings said the strike teams have been visiting businesses for 106 days to ensure businesses within the county are following COVID-19 guidelines — as of Sunday, the teams have the ability to issue warnings and citations. 
“Our teams will continue to ensure our residents have safe businesses to patronize,” he said during the press conference. 
Three resturants,  a car dealership and a retail store were issued citations between Wednesday and Thurday. Knight News obtained an example of a citation issued to businesses, and the records kept by the strike teams from each visit through Thursday, from Orange County.
Businesses issued a fine have two options — pay the fine within 14 days or take the citation to court. 
All businesses listed in the spreadsheet — whether a citation or warning was issued — were said to be “not in compliance,” and not one was found to be “in compliance” of following the mandatory facial covering executive order, records show. 
These are the five businesses the strike teams issued citations for between Wednesday and Thursday, and the details written in the spreadsheet. The pdf of the spreadsheet Knight News obtained can be read here.
