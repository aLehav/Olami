Knight News reached out to UCF Athletics regarding the ultimatum given to UCF football kicker Donald De La Haye by the NCAA. After requesting to view all e-mails exchanged between UCF officials and the NCAA that pertain to De La Haye, they refused:
“The request you made is targeted to one student. An education record is any record that directly relates to a student maintained by the institution. Given the targeted nature of your request, it is impossible for the University to respond without revealing non-directory information.  Therefore, there are no documents responsive to your request which are not confidential and exempt.”
UCF Athletics also refused to release any e-mails between the university and De La Haye for similar reasons:
  “As above, an education record is any record that directly relates to a student maintained by the institution. Given the targeted nature of your request, it is impossible for the University to respond without revealing non-directory information.  Therefore, there are no documents responsive to your request which are not confidential and exempt.”
Knight News also requested any and all materials presented to UCF student-athletes about NCAA bylaws regarding eligibility, which has been forwarded to the Compliance department, according to UCF Athletics.
Knight News will continue to follow this story.
