Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered UCF student Jack Sweeney $5,000 to stop tracking his private jet and posting its whereabouts on Twitter.
Sweeney refused to give in.
Instead, the freshman rebutted by raising the asking price to $50,000 and an internship.  Musk refused.
Sweeney reportedly received another offer to take down the page on Friday.
According to businessinsider.com, CEO of Autonomy — a car-hire company — Scott Painter offered Sweeney a subscription to a Tesla Model 3 if he deleted the account.
After previously stating that he would delete the page in exchange for a free Tesla, Sweeney still wouldn’t budge.
“I’m not giving up something that I like for something that I don’t completely want,” Sweeney said. “I want my own car. I don’t want to have to give it back in three years.”
“He’s getting a lot of attention, and it’s not necessarily the greatest attention,” Painter said in an interview, according to the Wall Street Journal.
“He’s in a tricky spot, and we offered him an elegant solution that we think works for him, and it works for us,” he continued.
The page, @ElonJet, currently has a following of over 368,000 users with its last update coming on Feb 3.
