The Knight’s Pub is looking to elevate the UCF bar scene–literally.
Knight’s Pub owner Pete Zachman confirmed that the bar is currently in the process of building a second story deck over the back corner of the existing deck. The deck is planned to be completed during the beginning of the spring semester.
Zachman told KnightNews.com that although there will be daily construction going on, the bar will not have to close.
“Most of the construction happens under the deck for the concrete pilings, but they put the deck back together every night so we don’t have to close,” said Zachman.
The bar is still relatively new to the UCF-area, holding its grand opening in the summer A semester of 2013, but it has been consistently expanding ever since opening up.
In Nov. 2013, they bought out the old Sage Leaves building(El Corral before that) and built “Next Door Bar”. Not long after that, they expanded to a deck connecting the bars and finally an outdoor deck bar.
