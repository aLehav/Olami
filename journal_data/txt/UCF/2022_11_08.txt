UCF announced Tuesday that in anticipation of Tropical Storm Nicole which is expected to strengthen to a Category 1 Hurricane by the time it makes landfall, the university will suspend all campus operations and classes on both Wednesday and Thursday this week. 
#UCFAlert: In anticipation of Tropical Storm Nicole, UCF will be closed Wednesday and Thursday. More information in your UCF email and on https://t.co/UbRsO6TMSw.
With the announced closures, classes will not resume until at least Saturday, Nov. 12 after the university is already scheduled to be closed on Friday, Nov. 11 in recognition of Veteran’s Day. 
This means all classes on every UCF campus including online will have all academic assignments suspended until the university opens again. 
UCF released the following statement for students and faculty on what to expect with the university being closed: 
The University is advising students to stay indoors and off the road once tropical storm-force conditions arrive late Wednesday afternoon and carry into Thursday morning. 
UCF says it will evaluate the conditions in the aftermath of the storm to determine when the university will reopen again.
