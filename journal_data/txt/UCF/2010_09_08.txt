The UCF bar scene is changing tonight. The troubled TD’s sports bar is shutting down, and its new owners are reopening as The Real McCoy’s. 
The grand opening is tonight, Sept. 8. and will feature a ladies night where girls drink from until midnight. According to its Facebook page, “Everyone enjoys $1 Wells, Domestics & Drafts, $2 Shocktop, $3 Jack Daniels & other great drink specials.”
They’ll even bring a little country flavor into the mix by bringing in a mechanical bull with free rides for the ladies and $10 rides for guys.
According to employees, The Real McCoy’s will feature some Country nights, which is new to the UCF area, and the building has been renovated from its previous conditions — including nice, new bathrooms. There are is also a new bar top and new DJ booth/dance areas. 
The Real McCoy’s joins a growing group of bars serving UCF, such as Knight Library, Scoop, Devaney’s, Deko, Fubar and others. The Reall McCoy’s is located further down University Blvd. than any other UCF bars, at 11400 University Blvd. near Arden Villas and Houlihan’s.
