The University of Central Florida is making national headlines as one professor has come up with an idea to avoid insensitivity this holiday season. 
In an opinion piece written by Professor Terry Fine titled “A Holiday Greeting That Applies to Everyone,” Professor Fine calls on everyone to say “Happy Federal Holiday” as opposed to “Merry Christmas” or “Happy Chanukah.”
“In our efforts to be inclusive, we show cultural insensitivity both by equating one major holiday (Christmas) with a minor holiday (Chanukah) and failing to recognize that diversity includes those who celebrate neither holiday,” Professor Fine said.
“As long as we live in the United States, these federal and state holidays impact us equally so we might as well celebrate them equally too,” Professor Fine continued.

UCF students heard this opinion and were quick to comment.
“Christmas is a Christian holiday…no one is making you celebrate the birth of Christ just because they greet you with ‘Merry Christmas.’ If you don’t want to celebrate Christmas then that is fine, someone can always respectfully respond with ‘Happy Hanukkah or Happy Holidays,'” UCF student Karis Lockhart said.
