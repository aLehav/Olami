The University of Central Florida Police Department has received accreditation and dedicated its new Emergency Operations Center and a sculpture in commemoration of fallen officers.
UCFPD Chief Richard Beary announced the accreditation on Friday after Commission for Florida Law Enforcement Accreditation completed their review of the department.
The department’s policies, procedures, management and operations were measured against nearly 300 standards to earn the new designation, Beary said.
“We have a standard of care now and we have to continue to meet that,” Beary said at the dedication ceremonies in front of the campus police station.
The accreditation panel reviews many of the department’s standards: from uniforms to the crime-scene tape the department’s 60 sworn officers carry in their patrol cars, UCF said. This is the first time the UCF Police Department has sought accreditation. 
“Everything we do is held to a standard that every law enforcement agency is held to,” said Lt. Jerry Emert. “Our officers really extended themselves. It’s not just about knowledge. They [accreditation commission] checked our attitude, how we feel about the department, the university and our customers.”
The new Emergency Operations Center is designed to serve as a headquarters in times of large-scale disasters or emergencies on campus, UCF said. The center was built in the police department’s former station across the parking lot.
A new Fallen Officer Sculpture in front of the current station was dedicated to all officers who have died in the line of duty, and specifically UCF officers.
