UCF had qualified for the National Ethics Bowl competition for the last three years but had not won until this year in Cincinnati.
Overcoming a field of 31 other opponents, the UCF Ethics Bowl Team made it through 6 rounds in the National Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl Competition.
Michael Strawser, one of the coaches of the UCF team and an assistant professor in philosophy at UCF, said in a press release, “This success brings national recognition to UCF in an academic area that is of great benefit to both individuals and communities that strive to deal reasonably with new and complex moral issues.”
According to the same release, some of the topics discussed included computer hacking, immigration, academic dishonesty and racial stereotypes among others.
UCF released this information about the winning team: “All of the team members are Burnett Honors College students, and five of the six are enrolled in the Case Studies in Ethics honors course. Team members include Alexander Kaplan, a senior Philosophy major; Jessica Fears, a junior Economics major; Stephen Oldham, a junior Philosophy and Political Science major; Kevin Dupree, a senior Humanities major; Ramon Lopez, a senior Political Science major; and Catherine Perrault, a senior Molecular Biology major.”
