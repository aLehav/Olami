Would you spend $100 on an all-you-can-eat pasta pass?
Olive Garden is offering a special promotion on Monday starting at 3 p.m., where you can buy a $100 pass to eat as much pasta, breadsticks, salad, soup, and Coca-Cola soft drinks during the 7-week promotional period. 
1,000 of the limited pasta passes will be sold directly from the Olive Garden website. 
“We’re excited to celebrate pasta superfans with our limited edition Pasta Pass, which brings even more value and excitement to our guests’ Never Ending Pasta Bowl experiences,” Jay Spenchian, Olive Garden’s executive vice president of marketing told USA Today.
The “pasta pass” comes as Olive Garden also has the “Never Ending Pasta Bowl” promotion, which runs until Nov. 9. The promotion lets customers eat as much pasta as they want for $9.99 per visit.
