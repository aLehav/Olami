After two weeks of class, University of Central Florida students were ready to take a break and enjoy a long weekend.
Labor Day is a federal holiday that recognizes the American labor movement and the contributions of workers to the country’s well-being. As trade unions grew in the late 1800s, unionists began promoting a national holiday to honor workers.
Today, Labor Day means a long weekend for students and employees alike.
While many UCF students spent this weekend hanging out by the pool with friends and going to the beach, some students had bigger plans.
UCF senior Tim Kujawa, 26, kicked off his weekend by screening his short film “The Door on Friday,” at the 12th annual Central Florida Film Festival. Kujawa felt that the film was “generally well received” and that the audience “gravitated towards the whimsical nature of the film.”
If you are around campus this Labor Day, there are a number of events planned in the Orlando area.
• In Winter Garden, the Plant Street Market is hosting a four-day celebration.
• Downtown Orlando, Wall St. Plaza will host a block party with free cover from Sunday afternoon through the early hours of Labor Day.
• Additionally, several rallies throughout the country have been planned to promote labor unions.
At UCF, the main campus will be closed Monday. No classes will be scheduled, and most on-campus services will be closed for the day. The Recreation and Wellness Center Knights Plaza location will be closed, but the main building will remain open with adjusted hours, operating from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
The university will return to normal operations Tuesday.
