If you have been waiting for the cold winter weather to come through Orlando, Friday will be the day for you.
A cold front is expected to sweep across Florida bringing a low of just 38°F and a high of 58°F to Orlando and surrounding areas. Skies are expected to be clear all throughout the day with winds pushing around 16 mph, according to the Weather Channel.
Saturday and Sunday will continue the chilly weather pattern with lows staying in the forties and highs in the mid sixties. By the time Christmas rolls around, however, temperatures are expected to remain in the upper seventies with partly cloudy skies.
As far as Thursday night and Friday, however, keep the windows open and a jacket handy.
