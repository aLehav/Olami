You probably assumed you were being watched when you take exams at the University of Central Florida, but did you know in some cases you may also be video recorded?
Fox 35 got a behind the scenes look at the surveillance system UCF uses. The station suggests the scrutiny is worse than you endure when going through airport security, and the reporter claims UCF’s cameras are almost exactly like the ones used in Las Vegas casinos.

According to an article published in today’s New York Times, when a UCF proctor sees something suspicious in a testing lab, he records the student’s real-time work at the computer and directs an overhead camera to zoom in, and both sets of images are burned onto a CD for evidence.
UCF told the New York Times that thanks to tactics like those, cheating has plummeted to 14 suspected incidents out of 64,000 exams administered over the spring semester in that college.
UCF issued a statement to Knightnews.com pointing out the video cameras used to catch cheating are limited to computer testing labs in the College of Business Administration.
“UCF does not have cameras in its classrooms to monitor students and faculty,” spokesman Christine Dellert told KnightNews.com. 
But if cameras are being introduced in some settings, some students may wonder where it will end. Earlier this summer, KnightNews.com broke this story about how UCF can read your Knights e-mail in some cases, when investigating “inappropriate” behavior.
