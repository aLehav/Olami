“Proud of Knight Nation!” Mohajir said. “Sold out of UCF football season tickets 27,000+ strong! FBC Mortgage Stadium is going to be Electric all season long!” 
The Football team has previously sold out their season-ticket allotment in both the 2021 and 2019 campaigns before entering the final season in the American Athletic Conference for the Knights. 
During the 2021 season, more than 280,000 Knights fans showed up throughout the year to support UCF as they were one of 22 teams to go undefeated at home with a 7-0 record.  
The Knights are set to kick off their final season before they transition to competing in the Big 12 where they will take on the South Carolina State Bulldogs at 7 p.m. at FBC Mortgage Stadium. The game will be broadcast on ESPN+.
