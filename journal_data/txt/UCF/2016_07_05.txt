A 23-year-old UCF student has been crowned as Miss Florida, and will go on to compete in the national Miss America Pageant later this year.
Courtney Sexton came first out of 47 other contestants in the state pageant on Saturday, winning an $18,000 scholarship. Sexton is currently earning her master’s degree in health administration, according to UCFTODAY.
Sexton is one of two contestants with UCF ties set to compete in the Miss America Pageant this September.
