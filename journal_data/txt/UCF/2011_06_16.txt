At around 11:30 p.m. Sunday night, Fabian Ruales 26, was hit crossing the street of West Palm Valley Drive by a 2007 Ford Fusion.
The driver was Leor Silverman 21, from Boca Raton.
Ruales passed away at Orlando Regional Medical Center on June 13. 
A Florida Highway Patrol press release says that, “This crash remains under investigation and charges are pending.”
A local newspaper initially reported that Ruales was a UCF student and that report was repeated by other media — but not KnightNews.com. Further investigation showed that there is no current student attending UCF by that name, and he instead appears to be an alumni.
Chad Binette a UCF spokesman told KnightNews.com, “We have someone by that name who graduated in 2007. No current students with that name.”
KnightNews.com checked with UCF after asking Sergeant Kim Montes, an FHP spokeswoman, if she knew whether he was a UCF student. Montes said, “I do not know if he was a UCF student.”



After a busy day in court that stretched from 8:30 a.m. until 7 p.m. that night, a jury was selected and opening statements were presented in the wrongful death lawsuit the parents of the late Ereck Plancher are bringing against the UCF athletics association. 
While sitting in court on Day 3, KnightNews.com learned that first thing Thursday morning, on Day 4 of the trial, plaintiff attorneys Steve Yerrid and J.D. Dowell planned to call UCF Athletic Director Keith Tribble onto the stand. He started testifying around 9 a.m.
