A new social media app is hitting the market here at UCF other Florida universities. 
Whichever Florida university with the most downloads will receive a campus wide party, according to one of the application’s campus ambassadors.
The app, called Happinin, is similar to the UCF campus snapchat story or and yeti, however the app has “channels” so students don’t have to flip through clips and pictures that they are not interested in.
The app is strictly for students. A student email must be used and verified in order to get points that go toward winning the contest.
Happinin currently has channels for Greek row, the library, from class, the student union, knight’s pub, stagger inn, UCF on campus housing, the UCF gym, and the CFE arena. 
Users can also follow other users based on their major and graduating class.
The contest for the most downloads among Florida universities ends on February 14.
