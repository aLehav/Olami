UCF police sent out a campus-wide alert warning students using the library to keep their high-priced possessions close-by while studying.
“We are encouraging each patron not to leave their valuables unattended on tables,” Cpl. James Roop wrote in the e-mail.
UCF police confirmed there is an increase in thefts in the libray, especially in the evening. The main target: electronic items, like laptops.
Roop wants students who see any suspicious activity to report it to library staff or police, whichever they deem most appropriate at the time.
 “We can all help reduce the crimes in our community by being observant and reporting incidents immediately to the appropriate authority,” Roop said.
Students who want to register their laptops or other valuables with UCF police can do so by visiting the UCF police Web site for free.
