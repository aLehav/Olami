This week, Wednesday through Friday, marks the days of Spring Fraternity Rush. This is when all of the Interfraternity Council Greek organizations come out to Lake Claire and set up tents for potential new members to walk around and get acquainted with each one — those fraternities with on-campus houses will open their doors, rather than have tents.

Everyone has a different take on what rush is all about and what it means to be in a fraternity. KnightNews.com spoke with a Vice President of IFC, as well as some sorority girls, to get an inside perspective about what going Greek is all about.
Anyone interesting in joining a fraternity is encouraged to come out, meet the brothers of the different organizations and get a feel for each one to find where they would best fit. IFC representative are non-partisan members of the Greek community and will not be associated with any specific fraternity, so they are are great people to speak with if you would like some advice on Greek life without feeling pressured by an individual group.
The schedule for rush is as follows:
Wednesday, January 27th from 7 .p.m – 11p.m.
Thursday, January 28th from 8 p.m. – 11 p.m.
Friday, January 29 from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m.
