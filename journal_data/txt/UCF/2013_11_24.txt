The UCF Knights (9-1) remained at No.17 in the AP Top 25 poll after beating the Rutgers Scarlet Knights 41-17 on Thursday.
The Knights are ranked between two mid-major conference undefeated teams in No. 16 Fresno State and No. 18 Northern Illinois.
Most notably, previously undefeated Baylor dropped to No. 9 after losing to Oklahoma State and Texas A&M below UCF at No. 19 after losing to the LSU Tigers.
The Knights have two games remaining this season, including an at home Black Friday rivalry game against struggling USF(2-8) who have dropped four straight games. If the Knights can beat USF and finish their season out by beating SMU, they will secure a BCS berth.
The Knights are the only defeated team in American Conference play this season, with Louisville and Cincinnati both being one-loss teams in the conference.
