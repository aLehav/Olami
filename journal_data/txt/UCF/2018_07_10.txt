An unknown man that committed a sex act in front of two women at UCF is at large, according to an alert from the UCF Police Department.
Two women reported that a man driving what may be a silver Hyundai four-door car followed them from a McDonald’s on Alafaya Trail to an area near Garage E on the UCF Campus, where he reportedly committed a sex act in front of them, according to the alert.
The man fled, and the women called the police immediately. The man was described as white, thin, in his mid-20’s with “Shaggy, surfer-style hair,” wearing a black hat, black shirt and khaki shorts, according to the alert.
Police have been unable to locate him or a car matching the description given, however, surveillance footage was released that is believed to contain the suspect’s vehicle, according to the alert.
UCF PD say they’re heightening security after another incident occurred on Sunday, where a woman reported she was groped from behind by an unknown man near the Mathematical Sciences building.
“I encourage you to be vigilant about your surroundings, especially at night, and never hesitate to say something and call police when you see something suspicious,” said newly appointed UCF Police Chief Carl Metzger in an email to students.
Anyone with information regarding the incident should contact the UCF PD at 407-823-5555 or CRIMELINE at 1-800-423-TIPS.
