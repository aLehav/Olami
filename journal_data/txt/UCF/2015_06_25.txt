Incoming freshman and future UCF basketball player Tacko Fall was at orientation Thursday. 
Students were all very excited to see him on campus today. John Howard, a UCF student, was shocked to see how tall Tacko Fall actually is. 
“I’ve never had to tilt my head back that far to look at someone, I even talked a little louder because i wasn’t sure he could hear me up there,” said Howard.
At 7-foot-6, Fall will be the tallest active player in the NCAA this upcoming season and is amongst the tallest 60 people in existence. Fall committed to play for UCF back in November. 
Fall comes all the way from Senegal to attend UCF and play basketball. 
UCF has not released the upcoming season schedule yet, but we’ll be sure to let you know when Fall will be making his UCF basketball debut.
