After only completing one assignment all semester, University of Central Florida student Sami Adel Ammar is facing a felony charge, after he changed his grade from an F to a B, according to the UCF Police Department.
On May 4, Ammar’s Electronic 1 professor, Chung Young Chan was alerted that the grades in his class have been changed. After the alert, professor Chan checked his grade list and noticed that Ammar’s grade had been changed to a B. This change stood out to the professor because he knew Ammar had only completed one assignment the entire semester, according to the report.
UCFPD was notified of the situation on May 5 and began their investigation.
During the investigation, detectives found the IP address of the computer that was used to change Ammar’s grade. After locating the computer, UCFPD discovered surveillance tape placing Ammar and another subject at the computer at the same time his grade was changed.

According to UCFPD, Ammar was uncooperative when questioned. Ammar has since been trespassed from UCF. On May 23, police issued a warrant for Ammar’s arrest, and he turned himself into the Orange County Jail this afternoon.
