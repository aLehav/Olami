The National Hurricane Center is showing in its five day projection that Tropical Irene may hit central Florida potentially as a hurricane and as early as Friday.
Tropical Storm Irene is moving westward at about 21 mph with max sustained winds of 50 mph. 

The storm is expected to cross over Puerto Rico before becoming a hurricane and going through the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
It is expected to be then downgraded to a tropical storm before strengthening back into a hurricane as it hits Florida.
KnightNews.com will continue to track the storm and post updates as they come in.
