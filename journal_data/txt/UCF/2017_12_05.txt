The University of Central Florida Police Department received a call for a suspicious incident that took place Monday night around 10:30 p.m.
Two residents of Towers 3 on the North side of campus reported an altercation and looked out the window to see a female screaming for help by the loading dock.
According to a police report obtained by Knight News, the caller and her roommates heard a woman call for help twice. The woman ran away from a silver four-door vehicle while a male in a dark hoodie chased after her. One of the witnesses stated that it looked as if the female was attempting to run to a blue light emergency phone.
The witness ran to her roommate‚Äôs room where they saw the male force the female down and then into the vehicle through the rear passenger door, where the male also entered before the vehicle took off, police say.
The car is described as a newer-model four-door silver sedan. The driver is unknown.
Update to the UCF Alert earlier today: We‚Äôve identified a vehicle that matches witnesses‚Äô descriptions and was in the area at the time of this incident.
