For the second time in history, the UCF Knights are once again ranked as a Top 25 football team.
After defeating Memphis Saturday, the USA Today Coaches Poll released today puts the Knights as No. 25. The Knights join Florida State University as the only other Florida team that is ranked.
FSU is ranked No. 20 after defeating rival UF in Tallahassee Saturday for the first time since 2003. The Knights’ rival, the USF Bulls, received one vote after defeating the University of Miami Saturday. This marks the second time this season the Knights have been nationally ranked when USF is not.
In the past, Bulls fans have said they are “too good” to play the Knights, and USF leaders pulled the plug on a yearly match up dubbed the “War on I-4.” Earlier this season, UCF beat USF in basketball and soccer, giving more firepower to UCF fans arguing the Knights are ready for a spot in the Big East, along with USF.
