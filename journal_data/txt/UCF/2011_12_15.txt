Two people were arrested in connection with the recent murder of Bradford Young near “The Plaza” across from UCF.
KnightNews.com has just confirmed with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office that Demarcus Reddick, born 07/02/89, and Tre A. Daniels, born 10/28/91, were arrested and booked into jail on charges of First Degree Murder, related to that fatal shooting.
Reddick was arrested today at 8225 Claire Ann Drive in Orlando. That’s in an area south of Valencia College Lane, just west of the 417.
Daniels was arrested on December 8 at 2681 Aloma Ave. in Oviedo. That area of Aloma is also not far from UCF, about halfway between Dean Rd. and Chapman, northwest of campus.



KnightNews.com has been in touch with friends of Taylor Lauren Wynn, the UCF student who worked at Wackadoo’s that died earlier this week in a tragic car accident. They have informed us of the following memorial services being held for Wynn:
Wynn’s viewing is on Friday from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The funeral will be held Saturday at 1 p.m. Both services will be at First United Methodist Church, which is located 1750 Twentieth Street Vero Beach FL, 32960.
We’re told her brother posted this on Facebook: “Everyone who loves this angel as much as we do is welcome to come to both.”
KnightNews.com has also received more pictures of Wynn, sent by her friends to remember her by. We will work to upload them ASAP as well. For now, here is the previous slideshow of pictures sent to remember Taylor Wynn.
