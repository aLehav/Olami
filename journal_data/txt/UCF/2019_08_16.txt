UCF’s Finest settled into their new downtown office early Friday after city and university officials cut the ribbon on the new UCF police substation.
The new substation is modeled after the department’s hub on the main campus, complete with a work and meeting space for officers, a patrol bay, and a soft interview room which is designed to comfort victims of violent crimes while talking to police.
“People can’t live, work, study, learn, do research and teach unless they’re safe and they feel safe,” UCF Police Chief Carl Metzger said in a press release. “That’s what we’re passionate about at the UCF Police Department and that’s what this substation is all about.”
Located at 398 West Amelia Street, the substation will service the 7,000 plus students at the new UCF Downtown campus, according to the press release.
A reminder that UCFPD will be opening the doors to our new @UCFDowntown substation today!

Officials say the station will be operated with at least two officers during day hours and three at night.
Classes are scheduled to begin at UCF Downtown on August 26 but campus authorities have been patrolling the site since June 28.
Last week, UCFPD officers started patrolling the new @UCFDowntown campus!
Although it's not open yet, officers are starting to familiarize themselves with the campus & respond to calls within their jurisdiction. We can't wait until UCF Downtown is filled with students in August! pic.twitter.com/H0AJPiujgv
