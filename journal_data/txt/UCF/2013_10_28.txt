The Knights have put up at least 30 points in all but two contests this season, while the Houston Cougars have put up more than 45 points in four games this season. If the Knights want a chance to play in a BCS bowl, this game will arguably be their toughest test remaining.
The game, which is also Military Appreciation Night, will feature a 1962 Vietnam era Douglas A-4C Skyhawk flyover piloted by Dave Dollarhide during the National Anthem.
Tickets can be purchased both online at UCFKnights.com and via phone at 407-823-1000. Tickets can also be purchased at the CFE Arena box office on campus leading up to the game.
