As UCF welcomes more students back this spring, the campus will also be welcoming back Spin scooters. 
The UCF community can expect 200 Spin scooters to be available at UCF’s main campus with new safety precautions in place, starting Monday. 
Spin scooters were originally brought to campus in spring 2020 and temporarily removed after the campus closed due to the pandemic, UCF said in a news release. 
UCF Student Government President Sabrina La Rosa said in a release that safety continues to be the top priority of Spin and UCF.
“We are excited to share that Spin scooters are officially back on UCF’s main campus,” La Rosa said in the release. “That’s why we worked together to identify several key safety enhancements.”
UCF listed the new safety and sanitation features that will be implemented this year to include:
Scooter rentals require individuals to download the Spin app, which is available on Android and Apple devices. 
Scooters will be available at 15 charging stations across campus and will cost $1 to unlock and $0.15 per minute to ride.
In the red zones, Spin scooters will not operate or allow parking, UCF Parking Services’ website states. In the blue zones, the scooters will have a max speed of 12 mph and in the yellow zones, the max speed is 10 mph. 
The max speed in the orange zone is 8 mph, and the red pins indicate parking hubs or charging stations, the website states.  
Green pins highlight deployment locations and blue pins indicate deployment locations near Greek housing.
Spin scooters operate from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. and are only operational on campus.
