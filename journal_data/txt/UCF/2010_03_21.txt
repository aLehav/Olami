The health care bill at the center of national controversy is expected to be voted on by the US House of Representatives late Sunday night. 
House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, voiced his opposition to the bill, which would transform America’s healthcare system, at around 10 p.m.
Boehner said that the process lacked transparency, was filled with back room deals, and called it a disgrace to great leaders of democracy throughout history. Boehner said the healthcare bill would hurt seniors on Medicare. 
Boehner asked for the Democrats to have the lawmakers vote by roll call, but it appeared his request was denied.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke about the healthcare vote after Boehner. Pelosi said, “When it comes to healthcare, all politics is personal.”
Pelosi said the bill will stop women, as well as anybody who is already sick, from being denied due to pre-existing conditions. Pelosi praised President Barack Obama and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy for their contributions as well. 
Pelosi wrapped up her speech around 10:30 p.m.
The healthcare bill is expected to pass.

On Saturday, March 20, 2010, Greek Week started off with a bang!
Or should we say with a stomp?
Greek Extrav was the first of many events to take place during the week of March 20th to March 28th. Greek Extrav is an event that showcases the talents of National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) with strolls, step routines and dances.
The Unity Stroll was up next; a dance performed by one member from each fraternity and sorority. Possibly everyone’s favorite performance was by Shingle Creek Elementary School. These little kids rocked the stage!
Afterwards, the “Divine 9” took the stage to individually strut their stuff. Finally, the host for the night: Clever, was introduced and the show began. Each organization performed a skit to wow the crowd. The first night of Greek Week certainly got everyone excited for the events to come!
