The U.S. News & World Report recently released their annual ranking of national universities. The rankings have been published annually since 1983 and are widely recognized as one of the most influential and comprehensive rankings of colleges and universities in the country. The University of Central Florida (UCF) was ranked 137, falling short of cracking the top 100. 
 This news comes as a disappointment to many UCF students, faculty, and staff who have been working hard to elevate the university’s reputation and academic standing. Despite UCF’s recent efforts to enhance research programs, and expand online learning opportunities the university was unable to break into the coveted top 100.
 The University of Florida in Gainesville was ranked the highest among Florida universities, coming in at number 29 on the list. Florida State University in Tallahassee was tied with The University of Miami, ranking at number 55.  The University of South Florida in Tampa was ranked at number 97. While these rankings are not the only measure of a university’s success, they are often considered a valuable tool for prospective students and their families when making decisions about higher education.
