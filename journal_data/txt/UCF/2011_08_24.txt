As the first week of UCF fall classes kick off, students will get a chance to see a free show featuring Big Sean and Chiddy Bang at the UCF Arena. 
It’s called the “Taste of UCF Concert” and will start at 7:00 p.m. Thursday, August 24. 
The Hood Internet will be starting off the show with a 45 minute DJ set, according to the UCF Arena website, to get a high energy atmosphere going before Big Sean and Chiddy Bang take the stage.

This show is being billed as the biggest production the UCF Campus Activities Board has ever done and a once in a lifetime experience. 
Students must make sure to bring their valid UCF student ID to get in for free. 
Otherwise, the general public can  get tickets for $20 from the UCF Arena. 
Seating is general admission for this show.
