Players cheered at the burger joint as the news was announced. UCF made an NIT berth under head Coach Johnny Dawkins in the 2016-17 season after rallying against a ranked Cincinnati team at home, and against Iowa and Iowa State, to earn a trip to Madison Square Garden. Held back by injuries in the 2017-18 season, the Knights would regain their resurgence later that year to begin a journey to March Madness for the first time in 14 years.
VCU men’s basketball finished at No. 1 in the Atlantic 10 and 25-7 on the season. They held a 16-1 home record and had a 12-game win streak snapped 75-70 in New York against Rhode Island in their final regular-season game.
