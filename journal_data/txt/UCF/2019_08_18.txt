UCF is offering 100 free tickets for Knights to attend Orlando City’s match against Atlanta United on Friday evening, Aug. 23.
The tickets are available for current students on a first come, first serve basis, and are available for pickup in the lobby of UnionWest on gameday at 7:00 p.m. with a valid student ID.
The lucky 100 will then walk together from the meeting location to the Orlando City Soccer Arena where kickoff is planned for 8:00 p.m..
The event page highlights the event as an excellent oppurtunity for UnionWest residents to get to know one another.
