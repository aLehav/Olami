As pierced feet protrude from a blanket, the identity of a bronze sculpture lying across a bench soon becomes evident. 
On Wednesday, May 20 downtown Orlando’s First Presbyterian Church of Orlando unveiled a statue titled Homeless Jesus, sculpted by Timothy Schmalz.
Rev. David Swanson of First Presbyterian Church said he hopes the statue will challenge people to think about their responsibility to those who are in need. 
Swanson said the sculpture is there to serve an artistic but spiritual purpose.
The sculpture is based off of the biblical scripture Matthew 25:40, which encourages helping others in times of need.
Since the dedication of ‘Homeless Jesus,” Swanson said there has been an increase in donations. Additionally, he said he has seen an increased desire in the community to become involved with the church’s ministry for the homeless.
Swanson said some people are wondering why $40,000 was used for the sculpture and not directly to helping the homeless population.
Holly Webster, an English major at the University of Central Florida, said she is passionate about the homeless community and hopes the statue will bring awareness.
Webster said she believes the sculpture sends a great message. 
“It opened my eyes and I’ve been thinking about this for years,” Webster said of Orlando’s homeless problem. “People don’t always see the issue when it’s right in front of them,” she added.
To others, the sculpture has a different meaning.
Eva Perez, a UCF student majoring in both biomedical sciences and Spanish, said she believes the sculpture is humbling, however, it also presents another issue.
“Images like this lead people to attain a reputation and it doesn’t change the nature of people’s hearts,” Perez said.
