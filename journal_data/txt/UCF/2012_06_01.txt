An Orlando area college student told deputies she was raped by an armed man overnight in the area of Semoran Blvd. and Auvers Blvd. 
The Orange County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to KnightNews.com that deputies responded around 4:45 a.m. after the victim called reporting an armed burglary at to a local residence. At that point, deputies say, they learned the individual “was also the victim of a sexual battery.”
The victim was injured, but the injuries were not life-threatening, deputies said. Deputies did not say what school the victim attends, but the area of the attack is near Full Sail University. WESH 2 News reported complex residents said UCF students also live at the complex, and that a source told WESH the vicitm was a UCF student. Again, OCSO has not confirmed what school the student attends yet. 
The suspect escaped without being caught, and deputies don’t know if he had a getaway car or ran off on foot. 
“The suspect is described as a black male with a medium build,” deputies told KnightNews.com. “This is an active case and Sex Crimes Detectives are working all possible leads.”
