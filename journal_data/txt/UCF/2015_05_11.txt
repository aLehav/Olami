Authorities found 21-year-old Dylan Besser, a UCF student from South Florida, unresponsive in a college residence hall early Saturday morning after a student had called 911, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
On Sunday afternoon, 18-year-old Julian Toomsen-Hall, a New College freshman, was also found unresponsive in a different resident hall, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
