Blake Bortles is already on the radar of local teenage girls in Jacksonville following being drafted no. 3 overall by the Jaguars.
Mandarin High School’s Tassji Krupcyznski made a video singing to Bortles and asked him to join her at her high school prom.
The video has Krupcyznski wearing her “Miss Mandarin” sash and signing a song to the tune of John Cale’s “Hallelujah”.
At the end, she asked Bortles to respond on Twitter. Right now, it looks like Bortles hasn’t said anything yet.
