The University of Rhode Island Director of Athletics Thorr Bjorn will announce Jim Fleming as the new head coach of Rhode Island football on Dec. 23, according to Rhode Island Athletics.
Fleming has been working with the UCF football team since 2011, when he was hired as the linebackers coach. He was named the defensive coordinator in January 2012 where he helped lead the Knights to the 13th ranked scoring defense in the nation at 19.6 points per game.
“We are thrilled to bring a coach as high caliber as Jim Fleming to Rhode Island,” Bjorn told Rhode Island Athletics. “Jim has a tremendous track record of building winners over his 27-year career, and we are very excited that he will be our next head coach.”
Right now it is unsure if Fleming will be coaching the Knights defensive unit against Baylor’s No.1 ranked offense in the Fiesta Bowl.
