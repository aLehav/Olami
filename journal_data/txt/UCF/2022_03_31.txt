It would be an understatement to say this weekend will be crucial for the UCF Knights’ baseball team.
The Knights (15-10) will host rival South Florida (18-7) in the War on I-4 to open up American Athletic Conference play at John Euliano Park.  
The three-game series is set to begin on Friday at 6 pm.  Opening pitch for game two is set for 6 pm on Saturday, while the series finale is scheduled for Sunday at 1 pm.
Redshirt sophomore Connor Staine will open the series as the Knights’ starting pitcher.  Staine’s 0.00 ERA in 24.2 innings leads the entire nation.
Staine (4-2) will look to outduel USF redshirt sophomore pitcher Orion Kerkering (6-1), who has struck-out 51 batters in 35 innings pitched this season.
