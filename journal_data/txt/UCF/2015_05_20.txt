UCF Police Chief Richard Beary and Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings will come together Thursday afternoon, May 21, to make an announcement regarding student and community safety.
This annoucement comes just weeks after UCF Police teamed up with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office to combat “dangerous alcohol related behaviors”. Several local UCF bars were raided on Cinco De Mayo as a result of the collaboration.
The raid did not result in any arrests, but in student conduct referrals instead.
