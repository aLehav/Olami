UPDATE: Massive Search Underway for Missing Mom Michelle Parker
The last time anyone heard from Michelle Lee Parker was Thursday afternoon, when she sent a text message to her family member saying she was at Waterford Lakes — an area south of UCF very popular with students for shopping.Michelle Parker flier
For UCF students like Jade Kilpatrick, this news comes as a complete surprise.
“No matter how many times you hear about a missing person, it always comes as a shock when it happens in your town,” Kilpatrick said. “Waterford shopping plaza has always seemed like a safe area.”
Police are releasing very few details, so it’s unclear what happened after the 33-year-old mom sent the text from Waterford. She didn’t show up to work at 7 p.m. Thursday and her Hummer was later found on the west side of Orlando, in an area her family says she usually doesn’t visit. 
A search has since begun involving Texas EquuSearch, the already-famous search team that you may remember helped search for Casey Anthony’s little girl, Caylee and missing UCF grad Jennifer Kesse. Now this case — with ties to UCF’s back yard —  is gaining national attention, with appearances on network morning news shows like Today and GMA.

Adding to the national intrigue, is the fact that Parker appeared on national TV hours before she went missing in a pre-taped episode of The People’s Court. Parker was in a legal dispute with her ex-fiance, Dale Smith, over an engagement ring she threw off of a hotel balcony during a fight the couple had at a hotel. 
Orlando police said that Parker has had a violent history with her ex-boyfriend, Dale Smith, but he has yet to be named as a suspect.
The situation has left more questions than answers in the mystery with a big connection to the UCF area. Count on Knightnews.com to keep you updated with this story throughout its entirety.
