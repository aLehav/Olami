UCF basketball players Jeffrey Jordan and A.J. Rompza have been deemed ineligible to compete in basketball games for the Knights, according to a press release issued by UCF Athletics Saturday.
The two are being “withheld from competition pending resolution of NCAA eligibility matters,” according to the release. The two eligibility matters are not related and are entirely separate issues, according to UCF.
Even though the two can’t play during games, they are still allowed to practice. UCF athletics said there will be no further comment until the issue is resolved.
