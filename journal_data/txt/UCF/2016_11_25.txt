“You not my grandma.”
That’s how one Arizona teenager replied after receiving a text inviting him over to Thanksgiving dinner, and claiming to be the student’s grandmother.
The woman, Wanda Dench, meant to text her actual grandson, but instead sent the text to 17-year-old Jamal Hinton.
“Who is this?” Hinton replied, at first assuming that his own grandmother had gotten a new phone. The student then asked the mysterious number to reply with a picture of themselves.
After Hinton received the picture of the woman, it was clear that that was not his grandmother. However Hinton still made sure to ask if he could have a plate of the dinner, to which Dench replied, “Of course you can. That’s what grandmas do…feed everyone!”
Hinton was touched by the woman’s kind heart, and decided to post the exchange on his twitter. The post soon went viral, where it was then picked up by CNN. You can read CNN’s original article here:

Hinton actually showed up to the Thanksgiving dinner, where the two embraced. But Hinton couldn’t stay long, as he had to attend his own family’s dinner.
If you have an opportunity to do something kind for somebody, please, please do,” Dench said when talking about the events on CNN’s “New Day” on Friday. “It’s a good feeling to give kindness, and it’s a wonderful feeling to receive it.”
