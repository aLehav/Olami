University of Central Florida President John Hitt has been rooting for his school to join the Big 12, according to ESPN.
ESPN reported that Hitt wrote a letter on May 17 making a case for UCF to join the Big 12 before its presidents met to discuss an expansion.
In the letter obtained by ESPN to Oklahoma State President Burns Hargis, Hitt mentions the growth of Orlando and the university’s popularity with high school students.
“UCF’s athletic profile fits well with the Big 12,” Hitt wrote, according to ESPN.
ESPN also claims that Hitt said UCF could expand Bright House Networks Stadium by 20,000 seats if it were invited to the Big 12.
“When asked for comment on the letter and report, UCF vice president for communications and marketing Grant Heston said, ‘If people are going to talk about UCF and Orlando, we want to ensure the facts are accurate and current,'” ESPN reported.
Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowslby told ESPN the vote to expand could happen by the end of the summer.
