Former UCF quarterback Blake Bortles has been selected no. 3 overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2014 NFL Draft.
Bortles is now the highest drafted player in UCF football history and was the first quarterback selected in the draft after leading UCF to a 12-1 season.


Defensive end Jadeveon Clowney from South Carolina  was selected first overall by the Houston Texans and offensive tackle Greg Robinson from Auburn was selected second overall by the St. Louis Rams.

While Blake Bortles awaits his name being called in the 2014 NFL Draft, he will be handling the reigns of the SportsCenter Twitter account.
Bortles tweeted from his personal Twitter account that he will be tweeting from the official SportsCenter Twitter account during Thursday’s draft.
“I’ll be taking over the @SportsCenter twitter account tonight. Be sure to follow me there for draft night!,” Bortles tweeted.
The SportsCenter Twitter account boasts over 7.4 million followers. This isn’t the first time an athlete has had the opportunity to tweet from the ESPN account. Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry took over the account during game 3 of the NBA Finals in 2013 and Ultimate Fighting President Dana White took over the account during UFC 168.
The NFL Draft starts at 8 p.m. and Bortles is projected to go anywhere in the top 20 overall picks. If Bortles goes higher than 11th overall, he will be the highest drafted player in UCF football history.
He is expected to start tweeting from the account at 4 p.m.
