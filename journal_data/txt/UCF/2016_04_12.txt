University of Central Florida, your fellow knights need your help to make it onto the stage. 
The UCF A Cappella group Voicebox is raising funds to compete at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) Finals on Broadway in New York City on April 30.

Voicebox was formed less than 2 years ago. The team recently competed at the semifinals in South Carolina on April 2 and won first place honors along with Best Arrangement and Best Choreography.
Currently Voicebox is ranked in the top nine best collegiate a cappella groups of the world. 
In order for Voicebox to reach the big apple they must raise money for hotels and travel expenses. The team has been working hard to fundraise while still perfecting their set.
“First we were recognized at our quarterfinal and regional levels. The leap from that to the international level is pretty significant for a group that’s only been around for less than 2 years. 2 months ago, this journey started on a high school stage and now we’re getting to perform on Broadway. None of us expected to get this far, so that just adds to how honored and excited we are to get to go,” member Morganne Evans said.
