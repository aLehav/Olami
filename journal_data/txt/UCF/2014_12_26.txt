UCF rundown:

The UCF Knights are looking to end their third straight season with a bowl victory matched up against the ACC’s NC State Wolfpack.
Following a uncharacteristic loss to UCONN (2-10, 1-7 AAC) on Nov. 1, the Knights have strung together four straight wins in both dominating and Hail Mary fashion. Along the way, they picked up their second straight American Athletic Conference title and earned their second trip to a St. Pete bowl game in three years.
The Knights boast the third best total defense in all of NCAA Division I football, behind Clemson and Penn State. Running and passing against the Knights will not be easy for NC State, as the Knights are fifth in the nation allowing only 3.08 yards per carry and also rank top 10 in passes intercepted.
Senior middle linebacker Terrance Plummer, heart of the UCF defense and team MVP, has been the heart and soul of the Knights’ defense this season that could arguably be the best in program history. In the secondary, NC State will have to be wary of Second Team All-American ball hawk Jacoby Glenn, who is an interception away from having the single season UCF record.
Aside from the defensive side of the ball, the offense is going to be the independent variable of the game for the Knights. Led by sophomore quarterback Justin Holman, the Knights’ offense has shown flashes of brilliance throughout the season and has also shown an inability to score.
Luckily for Knights’ fans, Holman and the UCF offense has shown consistency over the past four wins and the last time they were on the field, they completed a 50-yard Hail Mary pass to beat East Carolina for the AAC Championship.
If the Knights want to win their third straight bowl game, the UCF offense will have to put up some points against this NC State team that put up more points on the FSU defense than any other team this season.
