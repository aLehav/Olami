A total of three UCF football players were named honorable mention All-Americans by Sports Illustrated on Tuesday.
Quarterback Blake Bortles, linebacker Terrance Plummer and kicker Shawn Moffitt were all named to the list in their positions. To this day, running back Kevin Smith has been the only UCF Knight to be named a consensus All-American.
Bortles was named the American Athletic Conference Offensive Player of the Year after passing for 3,280 yards with 22 touchdowns and completing 68.1 percent of his passes. Plummer led the Knights with 96 tackles and anchored the defense, which suffered many injuries throughout the season. Moffitt made 20 out of his 22 field goal attempts on the season, including a game winner against Temple and a 50-yarder.
