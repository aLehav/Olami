Early Saturday morning, UCF defensive back Chris Williams became the victim of a shooting in a parking lot outside of King Tut’s Lounge, a ‘Hookah bar,’ on Alafaya Trail, deputies said.
Authorities say an argument or physical confrontation led to the shooting at approximately 1 a.m.
Williams was transported to Florida Hospital East for non-life-threatening injuries – two wounds to the arm.
UCF Interim A.D. and head football coach George O’Leary released a statement on the incident:
“On Monday morning, I gathered all of the information I could obtain on the Chris Williams incident, and I will turn that report over to the police. Chris was being released from the hospital on Monday. Our trainers and doctors will be looking after him from that point on. Any further information I do gather, I will release as soon as I have it.”
The bar has since been closed, following Saturday’s altercation.
