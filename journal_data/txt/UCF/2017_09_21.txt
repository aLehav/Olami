ORLANDO, Fla. — The much anticipated eleventh game of the UCF Football Schedule has officially been announced, slating a September 28 kickoff against the Austin Peay Governors.
“I can’t thank Oliver Luck and the staff at the NCAA enough for their help and understanding of our situation,” Director of Athletics Danny White said.
“We greatly appreciate Austin Peay being willing to visit Spectrum Stadium. We’re thrilled for our student-athletes, who deserve every opportunity they can get to go out and compete. I know our fans will be excited about the opportunity to have another Saturday at Spectrum Stadium.”
There was a violent undercurrent surrounding the University after the cancellation of two home games early in the season in light of complications stemming from Hurricane Irma, alluding that scheduling this game was absolute certainty. The only bridge left to cross was finding the ideal opponent.
Austin Peay recently snapped the longest losing streak in Division One NCAA Football, snapping a 29-game losing streak on September 16 with a 69-13 dismantling of Morehead State.
Suspended players Tristan Payton and Nevelle Clarke will have served their six-game suspension the week before, meaning that Austin Peay marks their first action this season. Adding an FCS opponent with a penchant for losing may be the best thing for UCF, as the Knights are clawing their way to a second consecutive bowl-game berth.
Having already lost a game this season, it would have been tough to justify adding a high-profile team that offers little chance of victory, let alone in a condensed season with one less chance for the Knights to make an impression on the field.
Hard tickets and parking passes will be delivered to all season ticket-holders and premium ticket-holders prior to the Oct. 28 game with Austin Peay.
Kickoff time and broadcast information for the Knights-Governors matchup will be announced at a later date.
