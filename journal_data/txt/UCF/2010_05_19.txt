The Palm Beach billionaire accused of driving while under the influence and crashing into recent UCF graduate Scott Patrick Wilson, then leaving him to die at the bottom of a canal, turned himself into the Palm Beach County jail Wednesday.
He arrived at the jail before the sun came out, one day after an arrest warrant was signed Tuesday charging him with vehicular homicide, DUI manslaughter and failing to give information or render aid in the crash, according to reports.

Miami defense attorney Roy Black issued the following statement today regarding John Goodman:
Palm Beach, FL – May 19, 2010 — John Goodman was arrested this morning and released on bail hours later in connection with the traffic accident and death of Scott Wilson on February 12, 2009.  Mr. Goodman intends to vigorously defend himself against the criminal charges while continuing to do all within his power to minimize any further suffering by the Wilson family. After thoroughly reviewing the facts available to us, the defense team believes that the arrest warrant and charges reveal only a part of the whole story. Mr. Goodman is entitled to his day in court. We ask that the public and the media not rush to judgment until all of the facts are known.
