Walt Disney World’s Wide World of Sports will start the building process of its new cheerleading and dance arena this month. It’s expected to open in 2017, according to Orlando Business Journal.
Varsity Spirit, a cheerleading organization, will be helping build the new venue that will hold over 8,000 people. The venue will be used for cheerleading and dance team events, according to Orlando Business Journal.
Other spaces within the new venue will be used for warm up areas, basketball games, and volleyball games. The venue will also have the ability to host concerts.
“As our sports business continues to grow, we’re thrilled to work alongside Varsity Spirit to create a sporting and entertainment venue that will not only complement our existing venues, but will be a model for cheerleading and dance team competitions,” said Maribeth Bisienere, senior vice president of ESPN Wide World of Sports, according to the Orlando Business Journal.
