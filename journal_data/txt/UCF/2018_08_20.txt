A new coffee shop has arrived at the UCF Barnes & Noble in the Washington Breezeway: Foxtail Coffee.
Previously, the area offered coffee and a place to sit courtesy of UCF. Foxtail Coffee made a visual overhaul to the area and came together through a partnership with the bookstore, just in time for classes.

The undefeated University of Central Florida football team received its first consensus preseason top-25 ranking when the Associated Press and Coach’s Poll released their list Monday.
The Knights went 13-0 after knocking off Memphis for the second time at the AAC Championship and Auburn on New Year’s Day at the Chick-fil-a Peach Bowl. After the roaring sweep of the season, a controversial, but well-earned No. 6 ranking was bestowed to UCF. It would be their third top-25 finish since 2010.
A complete coaching staff reset, with the return of key players, has raised question marks to how the Knights might perform in 2018. Typically, a change in coaching staff has been the precursor to a rebuilding season, however, given last year’s performance and the schedule for this season, UCF has a strong chance for at least a 10-2 finish.
UCF Football responded to the ranking with a tweet illustrating a chip on their shoulder, eager to repeat the 2017 season under the leadership of head coach Josh Heupel.

👇Great illustration of the “perception” battle we are facing. I couldn’t be more confident that we have the student-athletes, coaches, staff, fans & donors to build #UCF in to a perennial Top 25 Intercollegiate Athletics Program. At that point, “perception” should = “reality.” https://t.co/4KBrvF1YaE

The Libra parking garage on the South side of campus changed 1007 spots to residential parking garage for the new school year.
Towers parking also has resident-only spaces to cut down on students living on campus from claiming an open space closer to class, usually for commuters, when private parking is available near their living community.
Parking woes continued on the first day of the Fall semester as university police redirected traffic from full garages to open ones and the park-and-ride service on the East side of campus near the softball fields.

UCF plans to open another garage in the coming years near garage C however no timeline has been finalized.
