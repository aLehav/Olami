As finals loom for college students across the nation, Spring Weekend offers students one last chance to capitalize on the semester.

Spring Weekend takes place in Panama City Beach, FL in mid-April annually. Already a very popular spring break destination, Spring Weekend brings all of the college party scene back to the city. Multiple hotels along the beach are booked exclusively for the music fest. Over thousands of college students across the nation flock to the music fest for it’s unique stage, unlike any other collegiate music fest.
There are two stages, both on the beach, including a headliner stage that can pack in thousands of patrons. Along with the stage, the event also brings in some of the most popular acts in house and electronic dance music.
On Friday, headlining acts include DJ REHAB, GTA, DJ CRESPO, and Team Jaguar. Saturdays headliners include Laidback Luke and  Dzeko & Torres.
The massive amount of spring weekend attendees arriving at once caused the check-in process to move slowly. KnightNews.com spoke to students that waited in line for six hours to get their Spring Weekend wristbands and hotel check-in.
“It was so hot in the wrist band room because there was no air conditioning. I’m just ready to go out tonight.” Mark from the University of Florida told KnightNews.com
By the time the sun started to set on Friday, most everyone was checked into their hotels with no major problems.
