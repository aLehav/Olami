The UCF paintball team won the national championship against the UCONN Huskies this past April and the re-play of the match will air on CBS Sports Network.
The paintball squad, which just recently became an official sports club in 2012, turned into a powerhouse team in just two years. The Knights came out victorious at the 2014 National Collegiate Paintball Association (NCPA) National Championship held in Lakeland, Florida April 11 thru 13.
The Knights competed against 14 other universities across the nation including Temple and Penn State before beating the UCONN Huskies 14-6 in the championship game. The games are set up in 5 vs. 5 style, where the goal is to eliminate the other teams players and hang the flag on the opposing team’s starting base.
Each half is ten minutes with a five minute intermission between the halves. Points are scored by hanging the flag on the other team’s starting base.
The re-play of the match will air on Saturday, May 17 on CBS Sports Network. Watch the video below for more:




Students looking to purchase parking permits this upcoming fall may notice a drop in price.
The UCF Board of Trustees is considering reducing the cost of hang-tag parking permits on campus effective at the start of the fall 2014 semester.
The price of the “D” hang-tag permit, the normal student permit, would drop from $135.04 to $112.54 a year. The semester price of the hang-tag permit would also fall, from $67.52 to $56.26.
Students living on-campus would also see a drop in hang-tag permit price.  Students using the “R,” “RL” or “KP” hang-tag permit would pay $168.80 annually, a decrease from $202.56.
The cost of parking sticker decals, however would remain the same, at at $90.03 a year or $45.01 a semester.
The UCF Board of Trustees has to approve the price decrease first at the next trustee meeting on May 22, then the proposal will go before the Board of Governors at the state level for approval.
