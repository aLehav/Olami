UCF Athletics announced that head coach Gus Malzahn and Director of Athletics Terry Mohajir will be hitting the road for the 2021 ChargeOn Tour next month.
“The ChargeOn Tour will be celebrating the announcement of an anonymous donor who is matching all gifts made to the Keep Charging On Fund, up to $150,000,” the release states. “This matching gift now makes Knight Nation’s support more crucial than ever. Help us reach our goal for our Keep Charging On Fund campaign.”
The tour will begin in Fort Lauderdale on May 12, before continuing up to the Space Coast on May 19 and then rounding out the month in Oviedo on May 27, the news release states. 
The tour will conclude at Downtown Orlando in August — the date will be announced at a later time.
UCF Athletics said due to COVID-19 restrictions, there will be less stops on the tour than in previous years.
“[W]e’re excited to get back in front of Knight Nation any way that we can,” the release reads. “We look forward to the potential of getting back on the road with more stops next summer.”
May 12 – Ft. Lauderdale (Oakland Park)

Activities at each ChargeOn Tour stop will be held from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. with a social hour and autograph session from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. The formal portion of the program at each event will be scheduled to begin around 7 p.m.
The ChargeOn Tour will celebrate the announcement of an anonymous donor who is matching all gifts made to the Keep Charging On Fund, up to $150,000, UCF Athletics said.
