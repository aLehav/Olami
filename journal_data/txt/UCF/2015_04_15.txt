A loud siren startled many students in the UCF area Tuesday night

The blaring alarms started around 11 p.m. and were heard from UCF stretching down to Dean Road.
KnightNews.com called UCF Police about the sirens on Tuesday night, they said they didn’t know what the noise initially was and that they were being bombarded with phone calls. In a release on Wednesday, the police department said their dispatchers took 120 calls within the first five minutes of the alarm sounding. 
According to the release, there was no emergency and the malfunction of the alarms could have been from severe thunderstorms that happened earlier in the week. 
The sirens eventually stopped around 11:45 p.m.
UCF said that the company that supplies UCF’s emergency equipment will be on campus to fix the problem.
“We will be having the unit inspected tomorrow to determine cause and make any necessary repairs,” UCF spokeswoman Zenaida Kotala said.
