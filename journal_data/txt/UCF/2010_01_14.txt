Usually when students feel the need to withdraw from a class after the add/drop week itâ€™s for a good reason. Instead of receiving an unwanted grade, the option to withdraw is a free, unlimited option provided to college students at UCF. Well, not anymore. 
After new Florida legislation, Bright Futures scholars will now get a surprise bill in the mail if they decide to withdraw from a course after the add/drop deadline. Withdrawing from a course will now mean the student must repay Bright Futures for the price of the class, usually around $375 for a three credit course. The change comes after a total reorganization of the Bright Futures Scholarship by the Florida government. 
Other changes in Bright Futures Scholarships include the elimination of the 100 and 75 percent tuition coverage for students that maintained a specific grade point average during high school. Bright Futures Scholarships, which is funded by the Florida Lottery, will now have a fixed amount of coverage. Government officials say these changes are necessary in order to repay a deficit previously caused by withdrawn courses. 
Students and teachers are divided on the change to the scholarship program. Many Bright Futures students think the change will force them to stay in unwanted classes to avoid paying the cost of the class, and in the end, hurting their grade point average. Some teachers have a different view, saying students might actually work harder in a class to achieve a satisfactory grade instead of choosing to withdraw. 
What do you think of the changes to the Bright Futures Scholarship?
