The Orange County Sheriffs Office has released new documents that shed more light on the horror and confusion inside Pulse on June 12, including confusion on whether shots had been fired at the Orlando Regional Medical Center, the hospital half a mile away from Pulse where most of the victims were taken.
Within five minutes dispatchers established that no shots had been fired. Another CAD entry at the time stated there was an “unruly family member” at ORMC. It’s unclear if that is what caused the confusion.
According to the dispatch, one victim with a gunshot wound to the arm was told by deputies “if he is able to walk he needs to go to the hospital due to depleted resources.”
Several victims told dispatchers that they were losing feeling in their bodies and did not want to die.
The dispatch includes at least five incidences of callers inside the club with the gunman pleading for law enforcement to come inside to rescue them.
