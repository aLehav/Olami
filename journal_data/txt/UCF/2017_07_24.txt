After a standout stint in the NBA Summer Leagues of Las Vegas and Orlando, the Miami Heat have signed former UCF guard Matt Williams.
Williams averaged 9.9 points per game and shot 38 percent from the field in eight appearances with the Heat this summer. Considered a three-point specialist, Williams knocked down 45% of his three-point shots in Vegas, good for 18 of 40.
At UCF he will forever be remembered for his damage done from beyond the arc, leaving the Knights as the all-time leader in triples (274), three point shots made in a season (126) and signing off on the single-game three point scoring record â€“ a dazzling display of 11 against the USF Bulls.
In his final season as a Knight, Williams averaged 15.1 points per game, started all 36 games and shot 38.4% from three-point range.
Matt Williams is the fifteenth player to be signed by the Heat this offseason.
