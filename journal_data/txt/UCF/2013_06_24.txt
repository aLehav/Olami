On Monday, the UCF Athletic department unveiled a new basketball court, pushed by a “#operationblacktop” hashtag that was trending in Orlando via Twitter.
UCF’s blacktop court is supposed to emulate the style of an outdoor basketball court, which is traditionally paved black. With the Knights moving into the American Athletic Conference, opportunity for national exposure will be more prevalent.
“When you turn on the TV, you will know when UCF is playing. We are moving into a new league and will have new opportunities for exposure and the timing is right for a new floor, as well,” Head Men’s Basketball Coach Donnie Jones said in a statement.
UCF’s new court follows in the footsteps of another Florida school, Florida International University, which recently gained national attention with their “beach-themed” basketball court.
