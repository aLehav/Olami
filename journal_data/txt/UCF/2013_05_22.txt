The UCF Board of Trustees will meet on Thursday in the Live Oak Ballroom and may discuss a potential 1.7% tuition increase to keep up with inflation.
This tuition increase is due to a provision that allows tuition to increase automatically to keep up with inflation if the legislators don’t increase the tuition themselves.
On Monday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott adamantly vetoed a 3-percent tuition hike by the Florida Legislature.  Scott stated his reasoning as Florida’s low tuition is a point of pride and he does not want to saddle students and families with more debt, the AP said.
UCF took a promise in December to end all tuition increases for the year with Aim Higher Florida, an initiative that would request $118 million in funding from the Florida legislature to be split between Florida’s 11 universities.
UCF spokesman Grant Heston also spoke on behalf of the Aim Higher Florida initiative in December.
“The only time in my career I can say I speak on behalf of the University Presidents, and the answer is yes,” Heston said in reply to a question of the unanimity of University presidents on no tuition increase if the funding is restored.
