The Icelandic Met Office has warned that small subglacial lava-eruption has begun under an icecap at the Bardarbunga volcano — leading Iceland to issue a red alert for aviation travel.
An estimated 150-400 meters of ice separate the surface and the eruption. Data from radars and web-cameras showed no signs of changes at the surface, according to the Icelandic Met Office.
 An eruption of the volcano that reaches the surface could cause “significant emission of ash into the atmosphere,” causing airlines to suspend travel in certain areas. 
The red alert is the highest alert warning on the country’s five-point scale. 
UCF is expected to play Penn State at the Croke Park Classic in Ireland on Aug. 30, should aviation travel remain open. 
Even though Ireland is not Iceland, the ash from the eruption could spread throughout Northern Europe, canceling all flights in the area. In 2010, ash from an Icelandic volcano cancelled 100,000 flights in Europe at a $1.7 billion cost. 
UCF officials are aware of the volcano and are monitoring the situation. At this time, it appears that there will be no effect on the game.
“In all my life, I never worry about things that I have no control over.” Coach O’Leary said.
