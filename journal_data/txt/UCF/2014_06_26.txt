After filing a scathing 31-page appeal accusing UCF of breaking its own rules, Chi Omega’s hazing suspension was upheld by UCF Vice President Maribeth Ehasz, according to a letter she sent the sorority yesterday.
“Following my review of material relevant to your case and your letter of appeal, I have decided to sustain the initial decision in your case,” Ehasz said in the letter.
Read the full 31-page appeal and the appeal denial letter.
According to the e-mail sent by Coleman, the Chi Omega housing corp will be responsible for $195,041 while the on-campus house is vacated in summer and fall of 2014.
In the appeal letter, Chi Omega stood by its members for reporting hazing and suggested it was wrong for UCF to praise how Chi Omega handled it while at the same time severely punishing the entire group for the actions of three members.
“The bottom line is this–Chi Omega Fraternity, its chapter, its leaders and members with the exception of three wrongdoers–acted correctly. The praise heaped on the chapter president was well justified. The finding of guilt against the chapter and the disproportionate penalty imposed on the Chapter, replete with enormous financial consequences for Chi Omega was not,” the appeal letter stated.
This is a breaking story, keep checking back for updates.
