The new University of Central Florida Student Union Chili’s will now serve alcohol to students 21 and older, filling in a role that Wackadoo’s gave to students having lunch with friends and to students ahead of tailgates.
Wackadoo’s, an alumni-owned restaurant that held the same location as Chili’s before a deal with Aramark and UCF took place, legally offered alcohol to students of age in addition to a full-service menu.
Chili’s will offer the same service in addition to their menu.
A permitting issue that took place on the first day of the Spring 2017 semester has since been resolved, UCF officials stated.
Food menus and hours of operation are provided below.
Previous story:
A brand new Chili’s has opened in the Student Union of the University of Central Florida.
Students packed the ‘Bar & Grill’ the first day of Spring semester 2017 to eat and take a look at the newest addition to on-campus dining. A Chili’s representative was on hand for students in line to answer questions and explain menu options on opening day.
@UCFKnightNews Good things are worth waiting for!
— Chili's Grill & Bar (@Chilis) January 4, 2017

Although divisive, due to the permanent closing of the long-time, alumni-owned Wackadoo’s in the same Student Union location, Chili’s may overshadow the memory of Wackadoo’s as the next generation of students enroll at UCF.
Hours and a menu for the Spring semester are below. No ‘Two for Twenty’ deal will be run as of now.
Alcohol will be served to students 21 and older – the same practice of Wackadoo’s and their legal sale of alcoholic beverages to students 21 and older. A permitting issue that took place Monday has since been resolved and the beverages will be sold under the permit, UCF officials stated.

Romeo and Juliet
By William Shakespeare
Directed by Be Boyd
February 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25 at 7:30 pm
February 19, 26 at 2:00 pm
In the 1930s, speakeasies were the place where races could mingle but they also sparked clashes as each culture struggled to maintain their share of profits and their piece of the American pie from the underground sale of alcohol. Young lovers Romeo and Juliet are caught in these turf wars and hatred as the Montague and Capulet families vie for control of the clubs, the distribution of alcohol and ownership of the American Dream.

UCF Opera presents Strauss’s Die Fledermaus (2nd Act)
Sunday, March 5, 2017; 2:00 pm
Die Fledermaus (“The Bat” and sometimes called “The Revenge of the Bat”) is an operetta, or light opera, composed by Johann Strauss II filled with typical Viennese music – it premiered in 1874. UCF’s performance will be sung in English and accompanied by members of the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra under the direction of Maestro Hanrich Claassen, who himself lived and taught music in Vienna for several years. This performance is of the second act of the opera, set at a ball in the lavish villa of the wealthy Russian Prince Orlofsky. Dr. Falke has arranged the ball as a way of getting revenge on his friend Gabriel von Eisenstein. Many humorous moments of mistaken identity are punctuated by delicious music including the “Champagne Chorus” and a genuine Viennese waltz finale.
(The second act of the operetta will also be performed fully staged with orchestra on Saturday, March 4 at the Plaza Live as a fundraiser for the FSYO. Details about that event can be found at www.fyso.org.)
Cost: $20, $10 under 18, free with UCF ID

Music by Richard Rodgers

Part of UCF Celebrates the Arts 2017
Friday, April 7, 2017 at 8:00 pm
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 7:30 pm
Rodgers & Hammerstein’s first collaboration remains, in many ways, their most innovative, having set the standards and established the rules of musical theatre still being followed today. Set in a Western Indian territory just after the turn of the century, the high-spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the colorful background against which Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a winsome farm girl, play out their love story. Although the road to true love never runs smooth, with these two headstrong romantics holding the reins, love’s journey is as bumpy as a surrey ride down a country road. That they will succeed in making a new life together we have no doubt, and that this new life will begin in a brand-new state provides the ultimate climax to the triumphant Oklahoma!

A brand new Chili’s has opened in the Student Union of the University of Central Florida.
Students packed the ‘Bar & Grill’ the first day of Spring semester 2017 to eat and take a look at the newest addition to on-campus dining. A Chili’s representative was on hand for students in line to answer questions and explain menu options on opening day.
@UCFKnightNews Good things are worth waiting for!
— Chili's Grill & Bar (@Chilis) January 4, 2017

Although divisive, due to the permanent closing of the long-time, alumni-owned Wackadoo’s in the same Student Union location, Chili’s may overshadow the memory of Wackadoo’s as the next generation of students enroll at UCF.
Hours and a menu for the Spring semester are below. No ‘Two for Twenty’ deal will be run as of now.
Alcohol will be served to students 21 and older – the same practice of Wackadoo’s and their legal sale of alcoholic beverages to students 21 and older. A permitting issue that took place Monday has since been resolved and the beverages will be sold under the permit, UCF officials stated.



Original Story (January):
Students at the University of Central Florida can expect two new dining options to open this Spring 2017 – Chili’s in the Student Union and Pollo Tropical near the Recreation and Wellness Center and RWC Pool.
Knight News communicated with UCF News and Information Senior Communications Coordinator Mark Schlueb on the opening of the two new restaurants. Schlueb indicated that, while there is no hard opening date set for Chili’s, the ‘Grill & Bar’ hopes to be opened in January – possibly in time for the start of the Spring semester.
As for Pollo Tropical, university officials ‘expect substantial completion by the end of January,’ Schlueb said.
This window will depend on the timely arrival and installation of an outdoor canopy to be set over a patio for students to eat, according to the most recent renderings of the building.
On current timetables, employee training will take place in February 2017 and a potential opening could take place in March. No official opening date has been set thus far.
Stay tuned for announcements of UCF student dining options and opening dates.
–
Pollo Tropical story (July):
To meet the needs of additional food service options on the south side of campus, the University of Central Florida and construction crews have begun work on a standalone restaurant adjacent to the Leisure Pool and Recreation and Wellness Center.
The 3,200 square-foot building, to host Pollo Tropical, will aim for a LEED Silver certification for sustainability and appears to take a different look than the Caribbean-style food chain’s traditional restaurant exterior.
In 2013, the Neptune housing community opened and expanded to include 650 additional beds in the Nike and Hercules complexes. Over time, the need for food options available to students south of Gemini Blvd. grew, with Subway in the RWC as the current closest choice, aside from ’63 South.
The building will be located near the UCF main campus south housing communities and will also hold a Café Bustello, with Pollo Tropical holding the majority of the 3,200 square-feet of space.
Aramark will contribute $2.5 million to the $3.3 million project and completion of the restaurant will be near the end of January 2017, according to UCF officials.
Knight’s Plaza reopens in August to the campus after renovation began in late May. The project enhances beautification on the north side of campus.

Business Administration 1 will see new renovations over the majority of the inside of the building during the Spring semester.
Walls, stairways, and floors have been stripped to make way for the next generation of learning environments at the University of Central Florida.
According to UCF, this remodeling will update common spaces in BA-1 on the first and second floors. This will include a cleaner-looking, “more engaging culture in a flexible learning environment that supports innovation and collaboration,” Director of Communications and Marketing Erika Hodges says.
Classes and activities will not be impacted this semester due to construction although certain pathways may be affected. Much of the work will take place after-hours and on the weekend. Periphery stairways and elevators should be used to access second-floor classrooms during business hours.
Several ‘Pardon Our Dust’ signs have been placed throughout the building to provide students with project information and second-floor access points.

Construction began at the end of the Fall semester and continued over Winter break. Completion of the project has been set for April 2017.
