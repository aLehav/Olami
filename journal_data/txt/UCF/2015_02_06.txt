Police have arrested 21-year old Javonte Jones after they say he brutally attacked and raped a woman in an alleyway after she was leaving Wall Street Cantina in downtown Orlando. 
According to the affidavit, the victim told police officers that she last remembers having a few drinks at Wall Street Cantina during the Super Bowl party and walking to the spot where she normally parks her car. The victim told police she does not remember how she sustained her injuries.

Police say that Jones is homeless, but that not all homeless people should be treated as potentially dangerous. 
Jones faces charges of attempted murder, sexual battery, robbery and kidnapping.

On Wednesday, Feb. 11, UCF Athletics will host their first sports and entertainment career fair where major NFL, video game and media companies like the Miami Dolphins, EA Sports, and the Golf Channel will take part in. The fair will be held at 4 p.m. on Feb. 11 at The Venue, directly located behind the CFE Arena.
“The goal is to make this an annual event,” said Jordan Lyda, Account Executive at UCF Athletics. “We want to bring everyone together every year to network and be able to help people make connections in the sports industry.”
Thirty to 35 companies will be in attendance. Some of the organizations attending are the Central Florida Boys and Girls Club, EA Sports, IMG Academy, IMG Learfield Ticket Solutions, Jacksonville Jaguars, Orlando City Soccer Club, Orlando Predators, Orlando Venues, PGA Tour Superstore, Sunshine State Conference, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, The Aspire Group, The Central Florida Sports Commission, The Dunedin Blue Jays, The First Tee of Central Florida and the United States Professional Tennis Association.
The fair takes place before the UCF vs. USF men’s basketball game, which starts at 7 p.m. Lyda says students from all over the state will attend the fair. While UCF students are admitted for free with a valid student ID, a $15 fee is required for non-students. Purchasing the ticket will also give you entrance to the men’s basketball game.
