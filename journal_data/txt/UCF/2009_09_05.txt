UPDATE Sept. 6 4:15 p.m. The victim of the fatal shooting has been identified by deputies as Rene Gonzalez-Doria, 36, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
Because of his age, it appears the victim was not a UCF student.
Read our original breaking news story from yesterday, below, for more details.
Orange County Sherrif’s deputies responded to the Waterford Trails subdivision after a neighbor reported hearing gunshots shortly after 8:30 p.m. Saturday. When deputies arrived, they found the hispanic male dead in the home. 
Deputies initially said the man was in his early 20s, but now say he is in his early 30s, which makes it much less likely the man is a UCF student. 
We are not able to check to see for sure whether the victim is a UCF student, because Orange County deputies have not yet released the victim’s name. 
The community where the shooting happened is home to traditional families, as well as UCF students who rent out the homes. 
On KnightNews.com’s facebook fan page, students have started sharing how the fatal shooting affected them.
“Our friends that lived across the street are staying with us tonight,” Morgan Lee Peters posted. 
Other KnightNews.com fans reported seeing the search chopper over their home. 
The suspect is still on the loose, deputies told KnightNews.com.
