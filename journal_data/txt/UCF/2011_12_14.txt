The Alpha Delta Pi sorority has reported that its prized lion statue, Alphie, has gone missing sometime over the past week. 
The original ADPi lion sat on the back porch of the chapter house and was given to the sorority upon the opening of the house, giving it lots of sentimental value. 
The sorority is asking for the lion to be returned in good condition — no questions asked — by the start of break, or else they will report it to the UCF Police Department as theft and destruction of property. 
The theft of the lion comes just before ADPi celebrates its 30th anniversary of installation in January, with many alumni coming out to commemorate the event. 
KnightNews.com has obtained an email about the issue sent to the UCF Greek community Monday by Greg Mason, the Director of Fraternity/Sorority Housing and Development. In the email, Mason states the theft is being taken seriously, and asks for information to get it back. 
“People may have heard something, rumors, etc. It is important to keep in mind that while some things are seen as a prank….in reality, it is theft….it is vandalism, and it is destruction of property,” Mason wrote in the email.
Mason says to contact him regarding any tips on where the missing lion is at 407-823-3445.
