UCF Quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. has suffered a broken ankle from an off-the-field activity and his return is yet to be determined, according to a UCF Football announcement.
“Quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. suffered a broken ankle from non-football related activity this week and there is no specific timetable for his return,” UCF Football said in a statement. He will not be available for training camp.”
Mack, who led the UCF Knights following quarterback Mackenzie Milton’s severe leg injury against the USF Bulls in November, was expected to battle for a starting role against Brandon Wimbush – a transfer from Notre Dame.
Shortly following the announcement, Mack tweeted from his personal account.
Battle Tested ….

Now as the most experienced quarterback on the roster, all eyes will shift to Wimbush as the Knights head into training camp.
Two others will also compete for the starting QB role, redshirt freshman Quadry Jones and true freshman Dillon Gabriel.
