The University of Central Florida alerted students of a campus-wide power outage that began shortly before 8 p.m.
The scope of the power outage is unknown and crews are working to have power restored as quickly as possible, UCF said in a mass message.
Students report that the streetlights and Business Administration buildings, among others, have lost power. The Recreation and Wellness Center has lost power although RWC Knights Plaza is fully operational. The library has been reported to have power.
Residents- power is currently out in Hercules, Nike, Libra & Apollo. Restoration work is in progress! https://t.co/tOxPYhLgNm

UCF Police officers are spread across campus to assist with traffic flow and student safety, according to the university.
The University Testing Center has lost power as well.
Lots of students waiting for power so they can take their tests. @ your teachers folks, let’s go home. pic.twitter.com/FLRufErTKY
