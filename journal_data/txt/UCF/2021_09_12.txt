The University of Central Florida welcomed leading actor, Chase Stokes (28), of Netflix’s series, Outer Banks, at Saturday night’s football game where the UCF Knights defeated the Bethune-Cookman Wildcats 63-14 at the Bounce House. 
According to a tweet by Stokes, he attended the university for two semesters and “failed out”, but claims to “still love” UCF Football. 
The actor moved to Orlando at the age of 13 then later graduated from Timber Creek High School in 2010. Stokes later received his bachelor’s degree from Valencia College where he then continued his education at UCF and Seminole State College, per an Orlando Sentinel article published in April of 2020. 
Stokes greeted Knight Nation by blowing a kiss to the crowd, then continued to speak to fans, and sign a UCF football.
