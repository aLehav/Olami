Gov. Ron DeSantis signed two bills into law that would “honor victims of communism” during a news conference in Miami this afternoon. 
The newly signed legislation House Bill 395 and Senate Bill 160 would require Florida students to learn about “Victims of Communism” in high school beginning in the 2023-2024 academic school year. High school students will be given at least 45 minutes of instruction every Nov. 7 about “victims that suffered under these rimes through poverty, starvation, migration, systemic lethal violence, and suppression of speech.”

DeSantis believes that the new legislation that marks Nov. 7 as “Victims of Communism Day” will allow Florida students to always be aware of the dangers of Communism in schools. 
“This legislation will make sure that our students and people throughout the state of Florida are reminded about the atrocities committed,” DeSantis said. 
The new legislation that was signed into law in front of the Freedom Tower, will allocate 25 million dollars for renovations and will make 26 road designations will three of the roads being named after “three brave Cubans who have fought against the Castro Regime,” DeSantis said.  
Manny Diaz, the Florida Education Commissioner said he says it is important that the next generation learns of the hardships of Communism so that can appreciate the freedom provided in this country. 
“It is our job that the lessons stands for the next generation so that they understand the value of freedom and perils of communism,” Diaz said.
