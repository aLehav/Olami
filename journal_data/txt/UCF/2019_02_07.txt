American Athletic Conference Commissioner Mike Aresco announced the release of the AAC’s complete schedule for 2019 on Thursday morning, UCF’s included.
“I am pleased to share our 2019 composite football schedule,” Aresco said.
“Our athletic directors and coaches have built compelling nonconference schedules that will again test our teams against some of the best programs in the nation. We also expect that our intraconference schedule will once again produce consistently exciting and meaningful games for our fans and our television partners, ESPN and CBS Sports.”
UCF will play four weekday games split on the road and at home.
The Knights open the 2019 season at home against Florida A&M on Thursday, August 29.
