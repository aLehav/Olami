The UCF Knights are set to take the field on April 10 at noon for the annual Spring Game and 25% more fans will be allowed to attend than previously announced. 
“With guidance from university health officials, and following recently updated CDC guidelines, the game will now be held at approximately 50 percent capacity,” UCF Athletics said in a news release. “All spectators are still required to wear a face covering and sit in the zone assigned to their ticket.”
Tailgating is still not permitted on the university’s campus, the school said.
Tickets can be claimed by season ticket members until April 6 or until 50% capacity in the stadium is reached.
UCF Athletics said if any tickets remain, they will be made available to the general public on April 8. 
“The best way to guarantee access to the spring game is through season tickets,” the release reads. “Season tickets start at $99 and are available now at UCFKnights.com.”
Season ticket holders are able to save their seats on their phones from their UCF Athletics account, beginning Monday.
Students looking to attend the spring game will just need to show their UCF student ID at the entrance. Students will not need to claim tickets for the spring game like previously required in fall.
