Blake Bortles is officially under contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars, inking a four-year contract worth $20.65 million on Wednesday.
Bortles’ deal also includes a $13.34 million signing bonus, along with a fifth-year contract option that could be exercised by the Jaguars.
The 6’5″, 232-pound quarterback was taken no. 3 overall in the 2014 NFL Draft and was the first quarterback selected overall. Originally recruited as a tight end out of high school, Bortles’ shined in his two years as the starting quarterback for UCF.
This past season he passed for 3,581 yards with 25 touchdowns and just nine interceptions, including helping UCF secure their first BCS bowl victory.
Unfortunately for fans hoping to see Bortles in action this fall, Jaguars’ head coach Gus Bradley and General Manager Dave Caldwell have repeatedly said that Bortles will likely sit for his first season in the NFL to work on his mechanics.
