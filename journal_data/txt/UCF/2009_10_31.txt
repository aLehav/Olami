On Friday night, Michael Newman was crowned the new Mr. UCF 2009-2010.
From here on out, Newman will serve as the figurehead of the student body by hosting events, making appearances all over campus and working toward helping the surrounding community, especially in the name of helping the homeless community and making UCF a greener place, according to Newman.
KnightNews.com sat down with Newman to reflect on his victory and discuss some of his goals for the coming year — and even his favorite cereal.

This past Thursday night GLBSU presented Diva Invasion “Jungle Jewels” at the Venue, inside the UCF Arena. It was a celebration of the gay and transgender community at UCF, with performers from Florida and a few from out of state.
 
The show was a night of dance routines, comedy and raffles. In attendance were MC’s representing three Orlando gay and lesbian clubs, and the diverse UCF student body. Most important aspect of the show was that it was a fundraiser for a suicide hotline and local outreach groups in the Orlando community for gay and lesbian high school students.
