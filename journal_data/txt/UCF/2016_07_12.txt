Thousands of protesters chanted “No justice. No peace,” and “Hands up, don’t shoot,” as they marched from Lake Eola to the Orlando Police Department headquarters on Colonial Drive in Downtown Orlando on Sunday, June 10, 2016. 
The protest march for the Black Lives Matter movement came only days after a gunman killed five police officers at a rally in Dallas, Texas.
OPD Chief John Mina interacted with the protesters throughout the event, as well as other officers helped direct traffic in the area. Orlando Police said there were no issues during the peaceful march and no arrests were made.
