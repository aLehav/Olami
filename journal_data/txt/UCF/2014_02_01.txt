In their third straight game against a top-25 ranked opponent the UCF Knights Men’s Basketball team dropped their six-straight to the Louisville Cardinals 87-70.
The Knights(9-10, 1-7) fell to the cellar of the American Athletic Conference with the loss, tied with Temple for the worst record in conference play. UCF tried to keep up with the No. 12 ranked Cardinals, but the Cardinals were just too much for the Knights overcome.
Isaiah Sykes could not find his offense, shooting 2-12 from the field and finishing with eight points. It was the play of Tristan Spurlock that helped the Knights stay within 10 of the Cardinals at the end of the first half, Spurlock finished with a team high 20 points.
Even though the Knights shot a respectable 22-30 from the free-throw line, the Knights shot a subpar 38.2% on field goals and 31.6% from deep. The Cardinals made over 50% of their shots and 36.8% from the three-point line.
The Cardinals’ senior guard Russ Smith had a game high 27 points while Luke Hancock added 16.
The Knights host rival USF at home on Feb. 5 at 7 p.m. as they look to end their losing skid.
