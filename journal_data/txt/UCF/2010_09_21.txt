KnightNews.com has obtained an e-mail sent out to the Greek Community regarding major changes to IFC fraternity recruitment at UCF. 
According to the letter, “IFC will not be able to host any recruitment events at Lake Claire this coming semester.” The letter does not explain why. We are working to uncover the reason for this right now. 
In the letter, newly elected IFC Vice President of Recruitment Andrew Capranos laid out several alternative options he explored other than Lake Claire. In some cases, it appeared facilities existing on the UCF campus would have charged the non-profit student groups so much to rent the space it was not economically feasible to do so. 
The first option Capranos listed was to move the entire fraternity recruitment activity, including fraternities with houses, to tents on Memory Mall. The Student Union, which is supported by student fees, typically charges outside groups to use this space, and it wasn’t clear from the letter whether the Union would do so for the non-profit fraternity student groups to use the space. The letter suggested this option was the most realistic and had the fewest drawbacks listed along with it. 
KnightNews.com has a team of reporters looking into all of these options and the costs of each, and will report the information as we learn it.  The plan is expected be voted on at the IFC meeting on September 29, 2010

On Monday night, the Campus Activities Board, and agency of SGA, put on a bingo night, where students came to Brooklyn Pizza, got free bingo cards and pizza, and played along for their chance to win free groceries and gift cards.

Students had as many as seven bingo cards at a time, and they followed along vigorously at their chance to win something as simple as some free bread, pasta or orange soda.
The next CAB “Grocery Bingo” night is scheduled for October 12th, at 7 PM in Brooklyn Pizza.
