While Knight Nation is certainly reeling from Saturday’s result, no one is feeling more pain than a bettor who lost $166,250 on a lopsided wager, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. 
The bettor, whose hopes vanished following a fourth quarter, last-minute trick play by the Pittsburgh Panthers, would only have made $35,000 if the Knights won.

The trick play used against the Knights is often referred to as the ‘Philly Special’ by NFL fans and was popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII.
