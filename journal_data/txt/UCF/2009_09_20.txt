UCF students are reaching out to help little Bella, a 2 1/2-year-old girl diagnosed with cancer.
Last week, Bella’s cousin, who is a UCF student, organized a fundraising event at Cheeburger Cheeburger to help raise money.
“Everyone just came together, we had this place packed, it was amazing,” she told KnightNews.com.
Bella’s friends and family are hoping to raise $250,000 to cover an experimental treatment for her high risk, stage IV neuroblastoma, which is not covered by insurance.
Anyone wishing to donate can visit http://battleforbella.com, where you can buy a bracelet with Bella’s name on it for $5.
“Anything helps, we’ll accept anything,” her cousin said.
