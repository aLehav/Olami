UCF students will soon have another option for nightlife in the UCF area.
KnightNews.com has confirmed that a new bar, The Annex, will be opening up near UCF. The location of the bar will be off of the corner of University Boulevard and Dean Road, in the same building that On Tap was located in.
A massive renovation to completely re-construct the entire bar is set to be in late fall with a soft opening. The grand opening is currently scheduled for spring 2015. 
The announcement of The Annex comes less than a week after another UCF area bar, Mad Hatter, closed due to towing disputes with the University Commons plaza.
