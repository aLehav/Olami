UPDATE 10:30 P.M.  Sources say the impeachment affidavits were filed due to a refusal by the A&SF Committee, which allocates a proposed multi-million dollar SGA budget, to view a budget packet submitted by the Graduate Student Association on the December 2, 2011 A&SF Budget Commitee Meeting. According to these sources, the affidavits were filed by a graduate student.
We spoke with Josh Miller who says “this impeachment is completely frivolous and has no merit.” Miller was unaware that this situation was ensuing and says the person who filed the impeachment is simply upset because the budget committee would not directly fund them.
Wes Jones motioned to dismiss the proposed budget during the A&SF meeting and Josh Miller approved this motion. Such dismissal is being called unconstitutional.
We will continue to provide updates as we get them.

Big Top Shirts located off of Alafaya and Corporate is an up and coming destination for all UCF students to design their own shirts.
Whether it’s just one shirt, or one thousand, Big Top has no limit.
But not only is it T-shirts that Big Top specializes in, they also print off shorts, hats, coozies, and tank tops.
Big Top caters to everyone, and will print off anything as long as you can design it.
Knightnews.com went to Big Top to learn more about them and how they makes their shirts. You can watch the video below:




A popular shirt bearing UCF’s name — along with a controversial play on words — is sweeping Facebook feeds across Knight Nation.

The shirt, which says, “GET UCFKED UP EVERY SINGLE KNIGHT” is being promoted on the Facebook page of CampuzTeez.net. The company’s webpage boasts that it provides “the shirts students want but schools can’t sell.”
The company uses a viral marketing technique to get the word about about its product, and it’s working at UCF. After it posted the UCF shirt, the company said it would organize presale when the post got 250 “likes” on Facebook. The posting had more than 500 likes within 14 hours.
Now, the presale is on. An event on Facebook has been created with students posting what size they want.
Students seem excited, sharing their comments on Facebook for all to see.
“Rush shipping?” posted one student. “I want it for spring break.”
“I want one, I’ll pay whatever for it, I want it,” another student said on the Facebook page.
The shirt company is also making shirts targeted to other schools. At UCF, the shirts are being listed at $15 for pre-sale, and $17 if you don’t pre-order.
KnightNews.com will continue following the shirt sale and let you know the reception they get once they arrive on campus.

The entity the University of Central Florida Student Government Association has paid tens of thousands of dollars over the last several years may become a lot less powerful.
Currently, state university SGA’s that belong to the Florida Student Association can elect one of the member institution presidents to serve as the leader of FSA. That FSA leader automatically assumes a seat on the Florida Board of Governors, the entity which oversees the state’s 11 public universities. 
But state lawmakers are moving to try to change the way college students are represented on the Florida Board of Governors.
A bill drafted in the Senate aimed to let the governor appoint the student representative to the board. But the measure was amended Monday to take the governor out of the process. Instead, the Board of Governors would organize a council of student body presidents and those students would select their representative. This would cut the FSA out of the process.

KnightNews.com hired a crew in Tallahassee to interview Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, who drafted the amendment. She told us the new version of her plan takes politics out of the process.
UCF already pays for its own lobbyist, GrayRobinson. So, if the FSA loses its ability to elect a BOG representative, it’s unclear whether the UCF SGA senate would continue to pay to belong to that lobbying group. A litte over a year ago, KnightNews.com exposed how it appeared FSA hadn’t even updated its website since 2004. Since then, the organization had a new website made. 
The bill is a proposed constitutional amendment. That means it will need a three-fifths vote in the House and Senate to make it onto the election ballot this November. If it gets on the ballot, it would need 60 percent of the vote to pass.
The FSA released a statement on its Facebook page earlier this month blasting the idea of amending the constitution over this issue. 
“Amending the constitution is not only a terrible idea in and of itself, but the product of doing so would be damaging to students who are not enrolled at Florida State University and the University of Florida,” the FSA statement read. 
Right now, under Florida’s Constitution, the governor has the power to appoint 14 people to the Board of Governors. Three others serve on the board, including the student representative.
