University of Central Florida’s Aubrey Dawkins has declared for the NBA Draft, UCF Athletics said in a release.
“I’d like to thank God for blessing me with the ability to play the game of basketball. A game that I love,” Dawkins said. “I thank my family for supporting me every step of the way. And I want to thank everyone at UCF and Knight Nation for an experience I’ll never forget. After discussing with my family, I have decided to declare for the NBA Draft to continue pursuing my dreams. I’m ready for the next chapter of my life. Go Knights. Charge On.”
Dawkins, son of head coach Johnny Dawkins, was key in bringing the Knights to March Madness on the court. The guard averaged 15.6 points and 5.0 rebounds per game and earned The American Player of the Week honors twice while scoring 32 points on Duke in his final game.
“We’re very proud of the collegiate career Aubrey has had,” UCF head coach Johnny Dawkins said. “He played an integral role in getting this program back to the NCAA Tournament and we’re grateful for everything he’s put into UCF Basketball. He has earned his degree, and he’s ready to begin the next chapter of his life, the next chapter of his career in basketball. We’re excited for what is next for Aubrey.”
The combine is scheduled for May 15-19 and the NBA Draft will be on June 20. Dawkins’ preparation for the NBA Draft has already begun, UCF Athletics said.
