Good news for UCF football fans–the season is less than four weeks away.
While the Knights are breaking out the pads to sort out the final changes in the depth chart, UCF released a new season ticket commercial as the season draws closer.
The commercial features top players from last year’s Fiesta Bowl winning squad, including Terrance Plummer, J.J. Worton and Joey Grant.
“Come see what we can’t do next,” Grant said in the video.
