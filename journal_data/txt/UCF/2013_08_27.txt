The University of Central Florida’s first director for its School of Performing Arts has been named after a nation-wide search.
Jeff Moore, chair of the music department, will take the director’s role and oversee the music and theatre departments along with the development of a new Performing Arts Center on the main Orlando campus, according to UCF.
“Jeff Moore is a visionary leader who brings dedication and a strong sense of mission to the School of Performing Arts,” said Jose B. Fernandez, dean of the College of Arts & Humanities. “His leadership style fosters a sense of stability while also encouraging people to think outside the box.”
Moore received his master of music performance degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and holds a bachelor of music from the University of North Texas, according to UCF. He joined the UCF music faculty in 1994 where he taught and served as percussion coordinator.
“I am honored to have the opportunity to lead the UCF School of Performing Arts. Throughout my career, I have always enjoyed collaborating with faculty, students and our partners,” said Moore. “This new position affords me the ability to expand on those activities while continuing to enhance our presence in the community and beyond. When you add the construction of Phase II of the UCF Performing Arts Center to this environment, it is a very exciting time for the performing arts at UCF.”
