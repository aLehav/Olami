Saturday was the Homecoming Awards Banquet, where all the hard work and spirited dedication from UCF students over homecoming week was acknowledged.
There was a lot of competition throughout the week, with many people pulling all-nighters for building floats, practicing skits and dances and setting up for daily events.
KnightNews.com was on the scene, and reported the various winners as they were announced. Here is some video we shot and the results:
