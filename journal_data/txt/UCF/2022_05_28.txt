The Knights left the field in the fifth inning, surrendering to the Sooners due to the NCAA mercy rule.
The Sooners showed their dominance right from the beginning of the game. Going into the second inning with a one-point lead, Jadya Coleman, a utility player for Oklahoma, hit a 2 RBI double to secure a strong lead for Oklahoma.
Soon after, Jocelyn Alo, another utility player, hit a three-run homerun brining the Sooners to a 6-0 lead.
Early in the third inning, the Knights left-handed pitcher Angelina DeVoe was able to compete a pop-up out, only to see that her efforts left the Sooners to score another run.
After a closing inning double, the Sooners scored another run closing the third inning out with an 8-0 lead.
A scoreless fourth inning lead to the final inning of the match-up.
After finding a way to pick up three walks, the Knights were unable to secure a run that would continue the game.
Although this was a devastating loss for the Knights, head coach Cindy Ball-Malone said there is still more for fans to see of her team.
“Oklahoma is a great team,” said coach Ball-Malone. “We talk about having no regrets and my biggest regret is that you guys didn’t get to see us yet. But the great thing is, we’ve got another one tomorrow.”
The Knights take the mount again on Saturday at 2 p.m. on ESPN.
