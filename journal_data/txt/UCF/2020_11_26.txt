Former UCF and Bills wide receiver Gabriel Davis is giving back to his local community this holiday season. 
“This year has affected us all in so many ways, and as we enter the holiday season, I wanted to do everything I could to make an impact in the community that invested in me since day one,” the rookie Bills receiver wrote in a post shared on his social media on Thanksgiving.

“The opportunity to give back is always a blessing,” he wrote in a tweet. 
In the post shared on Davis’ social media, he said the sky’s the limit for the Seminole High School football program. 
“I hope this $ contribution lifts the squad to a strong run this playoff season! Go get that chip,” he said. 
Davis said he teamed up with Sonny’s BBQ to provide a Thanksgiving meal to the Sanford Fire Department and Sanford Police Department. 
“… You risk your lives to keep our people no matter the circumstance,” he said. “I’m excited to team up with Sonny’s BBQ to provide you a Thanksgiving meal as a token of our appreciation.”
