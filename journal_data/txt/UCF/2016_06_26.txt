UCF Greek life is Orlando strong.
This Saturday, July 2nd, UCF’s Greek Council and Zeta Beta Tau will hold a 5K supporting the victims and employees of the Pulse night club shooting.
The event will be held at the UCF Reflection Pond from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.
UCF’s Greek Council is the governing body of UCF Greek Life, and is made up of close 50 fraternities and sororities. 
All proceeds of the 5K will be donated to the Pulse Employee Recovery Fund and Pulse owner Barbara Poma, an alumnus of Pi Beta Phi at UCF. The proceeds will directly benefit the over 70 Pulse employees who were affected by this tragedy.
The event will include speakers from UCF and the LGBT+ community as well as games, music, and activities for non-runners to participate in. 
Registration is $10 and $15 with a T-shirt. Greek council has reported that there are less than 500 registration spots left.

On Monday, June 27th, the University of Central Florida will host its largest blood drive yet with twelve OneBlood Big Red Buses lined through Bright House Networks Stadium.
At 11 a.m. students and community members can begin to donate blood in approximately 500 appointment slots, with additional appointments open to platelet donations.
Two weeks earlier, on June 12th, loss of life in downtown Orlando led thousands of Central Florida residents to show up to local blood banks, often waiting in line in upwards of 4 hours. At UCF, dozens of students queued in front of a OneBlood bus in the Student Union Plaza to donate, with appearances from UCF president John Hitt, SGA president Chris Clemente, Knightro, and the UCF men’s basketball teams.
Knightro and the UCF cheerleaders will be at the stadium in a show of support to those that attend.
