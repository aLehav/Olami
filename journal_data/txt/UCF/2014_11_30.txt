UCF senior wide receiver J.J. Worton’s career at UCF has been cut short after suffering an ACL tear during the Nov. 22 win against SMU.
Worton was helped off of the field during the SMU game and returned to catch a touchdown pass, but it wasn’t until later in the week that doctors determined that Worton had torn his ACL.
Worton, a senior who is second on the team in receiving yards, will miss the final two games of his career as UCF is fighting for the share of the AAC title.
“Sad to say that my UCF career is over. I will treasure all the memories. I love my teammates, coaches, and all of the UCF fans so much,” Worton tweeted out on Friday.

J.J. Worton made national headlines for “the catch” which saved UCF’s BCS bowl winning season against Temple. Worton extended to make an acrobatic catch in the back of the end zone, which won him an ESPN Sport Science award for “Best Catch”. 
Worton finishes his career at UCF with 168 receptions for 2,360 yards and 21 touchdowns. Also as a four-year kick returner, Worton has returned 72 kicks for 746 yards.
