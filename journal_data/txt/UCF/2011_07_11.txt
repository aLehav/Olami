Once Casey Anthony is released from jail on July 17th, she could transition from behind bars to the celebrity spotlight. 
According to RadarOnline.com, Anthony was offered $1 million to appear on “The Jerry Springer Show.” 
The catch?
Her entire family, including her parents and brother, must appear on the show with her.
After a few hours of this news going viral on Friday, July 8th, reports were then denied of such an offer. 
This was the first deal (of many to come) offered to the 25-year old who is despised all across the nation. Anthony was reportedly offered a job in the porn industry from Vivid entertainment as well, according to IBTimes.com.
“The Jerry Springer Show has denied any claims that they offered Anthony any money,” said Joey Ferguson from DeseretNews.com. “According to the show’s publicist, she won’t ever go on the show.”
Regardless if Anthony goes on the show or not, Ferguson believes that heavy coverage of Anthony won’t go on for much longer.
Thousands of people have already joined Facebook groups that are against the official court rulings for Anthony, and video clips of her on websites such as Youtube.com are full of threatening comments. 
“The people that are the most disgusted by the fact that she is being offered this exorbitant sum of money for making one appearance on a daytime television show are the same people that have made her a national celebrity by making her trial the highest rated daytime program over the past few weeks,” said UCF graduate and Orlando resident Kevin Roth. 
“This is what happens when you live in a country that empowers movie stars and celebrities over world leaders, cancer researchers, Pulitzer Prize winners, and the like.”
Although Roth believes that this offer is just the tip of the iceberg, Jason Pinter of the Huffington Post expects Anthony to fade from the public eye and disputes that she will receive a book deal.
It’s also anticipated that a movie could be made based on Anthony’s recent years.
