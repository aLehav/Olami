The College Football Playoff Committee has ranked UCF No. 18 in the nation in the first of six installments leading up to the four-team playoff.
It is the first time that UCF has been ranked by the committee since the playoff was implemented, last wearing the badge of a ranked team in 2013 – the last season of the Bowl Championship Series. UCF stands undefeated atop the American Athletic Conference and was most recently voted No. 15 in the AP Top 25 Poll.

McKenzie Milton and company lead the nation in scoring offense, are fifth in total offense per game and are one of only five teams left that are still undefeated.
UCF travels to Dallas this weekend for a conference matchup with the SMU Mustangs.
