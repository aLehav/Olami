The Florida panhandle falls in the cone of uncertainty for Category 1 Hurricane Michael.
The National Hurricane Center projects the storm to strike the Tallahassee area as a Category 3 hurricane Wednesday with sustained winds of 111 to 129 mph.
Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency to prepare resources and the recovery effort.
“Life-threatening storm surge is possible along portions of the Florida Gulf Coast regardless of the storm’s exact track or intensity,” the NHC said.
“Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes.”
The storm is not expected to impact Orlando or the UCF area.
