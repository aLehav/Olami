A UCF student, and his car, will be 1 of only 125 to be featured in Downtown Disney’s Car Masters Car Show this June.
Alex Sica, an avid car enthusiast, was selected to be featured in the two day show which features reality TV star, Chip Foose.
Sica, who drives a customized 2005 Denali, was very excited to be chosen and is looking to have his car signed by Foose.
The car show, now in its second year, takes place between June 2-3 at Downtown Disney and celebrates everything “Cars.” The event features meet and greets with Lightning McQueen, Mater and Finn McMissile and includes vendors, DJ’s food and fun!
The show also has several awards that will be given to the selected cars and includes a fan favorite!
