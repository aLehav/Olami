For the first time since 2019, Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party returns to Magic Kingdom in August after being cancelled for the past two years. The Disney themed Halloween event will return for 37 nights on select dates starting on Aug. 12 and will run through October 31. 
The announcement for the return of this event came after Disney announced their “Halfway to Halloween” week-long event on their social media account revealing Halloween themed recipes, “shriek peeks” of things to come and even a Hocus Pocus virtual watch party.
