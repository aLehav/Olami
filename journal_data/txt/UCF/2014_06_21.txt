Just over six months ago, Blake Bortles and Storm Johnson raised the Fiesta Bowl trophy together–shocking the ESPN “experts” and college football world alike.
Not too long after, Bortles and Johnson held a joint press conference announcing that they would be pursuing their NFL dreams. By a stroke of luck and savvy moves by the Jacksonville Jaguars, the duo was drafted together to play professional football just a couple hours away from home.

On Friday, an estimated 1,200 fans packed the Miller’s Ale House parking lot in Oviedo to welcome the duo back home before they go back to Jacksonville to get ready for training camp. 
Donning full Jaguars’ gear, the Bortles and Johnson stuck around until dark to ensure that every fan who showed up was able to get an autograph. 
“It’s been a great feeling. I’m just enjoying it,” Johnson said.
