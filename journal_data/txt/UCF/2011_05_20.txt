Harold Camping, the leader of Family Radio, an independent ministry, has predicted the end of the world and the second coming of Jesus to take place this Saturday.
According to the Daily Mail, Camping bases his claims from numbers taken from the Bible which he has calculated for the Rapture to take place at 6 p.m. tomorrow.
This isn’t the first time Camping has predicted the Rapture. He also claimed in his book “1994?” that the world would end then. He later apologized, citing a mathematical error. 
The Rapture is allegedly a period where the people God has chosen rise to heaven while the people not chosen suffer the apocalypse, which will consist of fiery earthquakes and terror.
The Daily Mail adds to this in their article saying it is “a period of ‘trial’ on earth for non-believers is forecast to follow and could last six months, but by October 21 all those who have not been saved will be dead, goes the prophecy.” 



CBS, TMZ, and CNN are all reporting that the “Macho Man” Randy Savage, real name Randy Poffo, has died in a car accident in Tampa, Florida earlier today. According to reports, his brother, Lanny Poffo, claims he had a heart attack at the wheel while driving. He was 58.
