UCF backup quarterback Darriel Mack, Jr. took to social media to announce he has entered his name into the transfer portal, but said this is just the start of his journey.
Mack, Jr. was one of 10 players to opt out of the 2020-21 football season due to COVID-19 uncertainties. 
Earlier this season, the NCAA DI Council voted to allow student-athletes to have both an additional season of competition and an additional year in which to complete it.
The redshirt junior tweeted Wednesday that he is immediately eligible as a graduate transfer and has two years left to play.
