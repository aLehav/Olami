UCF junior wide receiver Breshad Perriman will enter the 2015 NFL Draft, according to an Orlando Sentinel report. 
Perriman’s father, former NFL player Brett Perriman, informed the Orlando Sentinel that the All-American Athletic Conference First Team wide receiver is planning to depart a season early to pursue his NFL dreams.
Perriman, a 6-foot-3, 214-pound wide receiver, leaves UCF with 2,243 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns in 39 total games. Perriman was known for his play-making ability, notably saving UCF’s back-to-back conference championship hopes against East Carolina on a last second hail mary this past season.
The UCF offense will have a big hole to fill from its departing class of wide receivers. Perriman joins seniors J.J. Worton, Rannell Hall, Josh Reese and Jackie Williams as outgoing UCF receivers. 
Perriman ends his career at UCF as the first wide receiver since Mike Sims-Walker in 2006 to record a 1,000 yard receiving season.
