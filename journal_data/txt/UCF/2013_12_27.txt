The Knights took to the field on Friday for their first of four practices leading up to Wednesday’s New Years Day BCS-bowl game against the No. 6 Baylor Bears.
UCF practiced at Pinnacle High School in preparation for the game. They will miss their defensive coordinator, Jim Fleming, who recently accepted a job as the head coach of Rhode Island football. Paul Ferraro, who has been reportedly hired as the new defensive coordinator for the Knights, will be in attendance for the game but is not expected to coach.
The Knights still have multiple events leading up to the bowl game including Saturday’s Fiesta Bowl parade and Tuesday’s UCF/Baylor joint community service event at St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance in Phoenix. KnightNews.com will be in Arizona starting Monday, Dec. 30 with full video coverage of the Knights’ first BCS bowl game.
