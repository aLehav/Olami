George O’Leary has always stressed scheduling tough non-conference games and now he has another one locked up.
UCF and Stanford have agreed to a two game home-and-home series. On September 12, 2015 UCF will travel to California to take on Stanford and on September 14, 2019 Stanford will travel to Florida to take on the Knights at Brighthouse Networks Stadium.
“We look forward to playing UCF as our first game against a Florida-based school,” said Bernard Muir, the Jaquish & Kenninger Director of Athletics at Stanford. “UCF is a rapidly growing campus with a tremendous venue for football, one that our fans will enjoy visiting.”
The game will mark the first time Stanford and UCF have met on the gridiron, as well as the first time Stanford has played a school from Florida.
UCF now has three of their non-conference games for 2015 locked up, with one remaining. At Stanford on Sept. 12, at South Carolina on Sept.26 and a home game against FIU.
