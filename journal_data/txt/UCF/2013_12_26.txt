The UCF Knights football team put away the Christmas presents and headed back to campus early to get ready for the biggest game in UCF football history.
The Knights will take on the Baylor Bears Jan. 1 at 8:30 EST in what is both teams’ first Bowl Championship Series game. The Knights arrived in Phoenix on Thursday afternoon and have five days ahead of them to prepare for the game.
UCF Head Coach George O’Leary also held his first press conference upon arriving in Arizona where he believes this young Knights team, which only has seven seniors, is ready for the game.
“Since they announced we were coming out here, our players can’t wait to play in the game and can’t wait to compete in the game. It’s been like that every day we’ve practiced. This morning they were happy to get on the bus and head to the airport and I can tell by their faces getting off the airplane that they are ecstatic to be here and they can’t wait to partake in the festivities of the Fiesta Bowl,” O’Leary said in the press conference.
