The University of Central Florida Recreation and Wellness Center recently made a mistake that led students to believe deadlifting at the main RWC has been banned.
When students first discovered the mistake they were outraged and appalled.
Former UCF SGA Senator Luke Davis said, “This is unacceptable. This egregious act by the RWC is discouraging active students at UCF to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I personally will not stand for it, nor will my fellow UCF students.”
“UCF continues to appall me with their administrative decisions. Their rationale and process development is egregious to say the least,” said UCF student Adam Moore. “Unfortunately I don’t see any upside or change in our near future.  I wish someone with some common sense and a brain in their head could find their way into the UCF decision making board.”
The ban is only being applied to the Knights’ Plaza gym due to the lack of space.
UCF RWC staff originally told Knight News that the ban was being applied to the main RWC and not the Knights’ Plaza gym.
Marketing and Communications Manager at the RWC Scott Mauro said, “There is no deadlifting ban at the main RWC facility. We have several slide shows that run on the TVs here and I mistakenly placed the wrong slideshow on the TVs at the RWC.”

Mauro also said the deadlifting ban at the Knights’ Plaza gym has been in place since 2013 when the facility opened. 
The RWC apologized for the confusion and said they will posting an apology on their Facebook page soon.
