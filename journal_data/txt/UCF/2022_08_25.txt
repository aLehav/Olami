American Business magazine Forbes, has ranked UCF the No. 20 best-in-state employer in Florida, making it the only university to do so in the sunshine state. 
Forbes ranking comes after considering thousands of institutions and companies that were considered for each state including NASA, Google and Lockheed Martin. Forbes created 51 lists that included one for each state and one for the District of Columbia. 
Forbes partnered with market research company Statista, where surveys of 70,000 Americans being done anonymously were able to freely share their opinions. Only businesses with at least 500 employees were considered. 
Statista required respondents to rate their employers in several different categories, including: competitiveness of compensation, safety of work environment, openness to telecommuting and opportunities for advancement. 
Respondents were also asked how likely they would recommend the employers they work for to others. 
As a part of the university’s Unleashing Potential strategic plan, UCF vice president for Diversity, Equity and inclusion said creating a workplace of compassion and inclusion is key. 
“We intentionally emphasize the potential in every individual and our commitment to provide them with access and opportunity,” Guzmán said. “We want UCF to be the best place to learn and work, and that starts with a culture of compassion, inclusion, respect and free expression.”
