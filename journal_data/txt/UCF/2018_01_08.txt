Florida Governor Rick Scott issued a proclamation declaring the University of Central Florida football team as national champions in Florida after going undefeated and winning the Peach Bowl.
“Florida is home to the country’s best college football, and this season, UCF proved to the world that they can beat any team,” Scott said.
“By having a perfect season and beating the only team that defeated both Alabama and Georgia this season, the UCF Knights are clearly champions. I wish both teams good luck tonight in Atlanta. Charge On.”
