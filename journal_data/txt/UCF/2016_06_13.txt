The University of South Florida held a memorial service on Monday to honor the victims of Sunday’s horrific massacre at Pulse Nightclub.
A gathering in front of the Marshall Student Center where student body leaders and members of the USF community spoke to a gathering of over 100 people was followed by a vigil where flowers were laid to honor the 49 victims who lost their lives.
The mood was somber, and silence echoed throughout campus as students and others congregated to honor and remember the fallen victims.
Knight News was able to speak to several USF students to hear what they had to say about the tragedy.




Two University of Central Florida Knights were among the fallen victims in Sunday’s Pulse Nightclub shooting.
Juan Ramon Guerrero and Christopher Andrew Leinonen were a part of the UCF family. Their names, listed in memoriam on UCF’s Orlando United website.
Guerrero was a pre-finance student and Leinonen, who was known as Drew, an alumnus who graduated with a Bachelor’s and Master’s in Psychology, ’07, ’09.
“This Couple Killed in the Orlando Shooting Hoped to Get Married. Now They Will Have a Joint Funeral,” a TIME headline on the two read.
Drew’s mom Christine, made an emotional plea on WESH when she could not locate her son after the tragedy. Her plea went viral after she said she did not know where her son was.
“Our hearts are with the victims, their families, friends and colleagues. We also mourn and honor those members of the UCF family who lost their lives in this senseless act,” the UCF Orlando United website states.
UCF is hosting a candlelight vigil Tuesday night in honor of the fallen Knights and all the victims.
It starts at 7 p.m. at the Reflecting Pond and is being organized by UCF’s LGBTQ+ community with help from UCF’s Social Justice & Advocacy office.
The university has launched its Orlando United website as a source for the UCF community during these hard times. It includes President Hitt’s message, counseling information and ways to help.
