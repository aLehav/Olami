This Saturday, February 2nd, at 11AM, the UCF Men’s Rugby team will host a grudge match against the USF Bulls.  The game will be played on the grass practice field adjacent to the IM fields.
After going undefeated last semester and winning the State of Florida Tournament in the fall, UCF is aspiring to go on to the national competition. Team captain, Gerhard Veit, is confident and excited for the spring season to get underway. “USF always brings a good level of competition and we haven’t played for over a month so I can’t wait to play this out on Saturday,” Veit said.
Rugby is a game unknown to most Americans.  Similar to trying to explain the beauty of American football to a soccer-loyal foreigner in a mere paragraph, this brief synopsis only grazes the tip of the iceberg of the fast paced, brutal and exciting game of rugby.
Like most sports, the game consists of two teams being pitted head to head, 15 noggins per team. There are two units on each team, split into Forwards and Backs.  Points are gained by placing the ball in the other team’s tryzone (endzone), or kicking the ball through the posts placed similarly to field goal posts. No forward passes are allowed but forward kicking is. The game lasts 80 minutes with a 10-minute halftime.
“Even if people don’t know what is going on, it’ll be fun to watch 30 men beat the crap out of each other for over an hour. The most important rule is to root for the boys in Black and Gold,” Veit said.
There is no cost for admission and all are welcome to come out and cheer for the Knights to ‘beat the crap’ out of the Bulls.



UCF students will have to pay just a little bit more in fees if the school’s Board of Trustees decision gets approved by the state’s Board of Governors.

On Thursday, the University of Central Florida’s Board of Trustees met to discuss, among other things, raising student credit hour fees to support programs in areas such as health and advising.
A $15.00 increase to the student orientation program was approved by the Board, which aims itself at increasing the the wages of the Orientation team leaders as well as improving the overall quality of the orientation program. This fee, which has not been increased since 2003, is a one time fee payed by new students and moves the cost from $35 to $50.
The Capital Capital Improvement Trust Fund Fee, which will charge students $2.00 per credit hour was approved unanimously and will go towards the renovation of the library (incorporating a 24-hour aspect) and to support other student driven projects.
A new $10.00 fee per semester for an Education Planning Fee was highly debated by the Board, ending in a split vote that allowed the proposal to pass. The fee is said to be for undergraduate students that will support the implementation of an enhanced advising system designed to keep students on track with their academic plan and decrease the amount of time students take to complete their degree.
Many of the Trustees felt that burdening students with yet another fee was counter-productive and instead, the university should try and raise funds internally. Trustee member Harris Rosen stated that he is firmly against raising costs for students, however, this fee would save students money in the long run and, therefore, would be the last time he votes for an increase.
“This is a fee that I believe will be helpful,” Trustee Rosen said. “The problem is that it’s a fee…I suspect that I will support it, much to my surprise, but it’s the last time I will support any increase in fees or tuition.”
SGA President Cortez Whatley had a lot to debate regarding the proposals and voted to approve two of the three proposals, while effectively tabling another. Whatley voted against the Education Planning Fee, stating that it came at a bad economic time for students.
We spoke to students of the Student Labor Action Project, SLAP, who attended the meeting in protest of the fee increases. 
“The only fee increase that the students vehemently supported was the one that they tabled and the rest the voted unanimously on so it just shows the disconnect between the administration and the students,” one of the student said.
When asked whether they thought Whately did enough to support the student voice, the students were filled with mixed emotions, being unsure with the actions he took.
“I guess in some aspects it was positive that he wanted to reduce the fee for the health increase but at the same time students don’t want increases period so its sort of like placating to make us feel better but its really not the main, huge problem,” one student said.

Students at UCF will soon have a direct route to get downtown. 
The following report was issued by KnightLYNX:
“Due to the overwhelming success of the current KnightLYNX service, the University of Central Florida (UCF) Student Government Association (SGA) and the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority (LYNX) will partner on a downtown Orlando expansion beginning Feb. 1.
The new Link 212/Knight LYNX Red will run Friday and Saturday evenings and depart from the UCF Arena every hour 9-11 p.m. Return trips from the corner of Garland Avenue and South Street will leave downtown Orlando every hour 1-3 a.m. KnightLYNX Red will travel downtown via Alafaya Trail and the East/West Expressway 408 exiting at South Crystal Lake Drive. The bus will make stops along South Street at South Bumby Avenue, South Summerlin Drive and South Garland Avenue.
All three KnightLYNX routes are funded by the UCF SGA as a way to provide a safe and reliable public transportation option on and near the university’s main campus. Currently the service is averaging 250 riders per weekend night.”
