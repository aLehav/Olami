KnightNews.com has learned that The Mad Hatter bar, located on Alafaya Trail near UCF, will be closing its doors until further notice. 
The Mad Hatter released the following statement via Facebook:
“As many of you know, University Commons instituted a towing policy in the Fall of 2013, which has had a severely negative effect on you, our customers, and our business. Ultimately, this unreasonable and unsafe policy which was instituted by UC has forced us into taking legal action and, as a result, the Mad Hatter will be closed until further notice.
We appreciate the continued support from our loyal customers. Thank you.”
