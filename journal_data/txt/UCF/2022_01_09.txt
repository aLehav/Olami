After watching former starting QB Dillon Gabriel transfer to Oklahoma University, the UCF Knights landed his potential replacement on Sunday.
Former Ole Miss Rebels’ quarterback John Rhys Plumlee announced that he has committed to UCF to continue not only his football career but also his baseball career.

While at Ole Miss, Plumlee did it all for the Rebels.
The former Rebels’ most productive year came during his 2019 freshman season, where he played two different positions.
Plumlee played in nine of the Rebels’ games with eight starts at the quarterback position.
Proving to be successful under center, Plumlee ultimately became the first Rebel QB to rush for 100 yards in three straight games.
The former Rebel proved to be dangerous with his legs in addition, rushing for 113.7 yards per contest.  This ranked eighth in the country, leading all freshmen.
Plumlee’s productive freshman season earned him a couple of accolades, which include freshman All-America recognition by The Athletic at the all-purpose position and being named to 247Sports’ True Freshman All-American team.
During his sophomore year, Plumlee continued to show off his versatility, even adding a new skill to his game.
Catching passes.
The former Rebel appeared in seven games during the 2020 season, starting one of them at wide receiver.
Plumlee caught a season total of six passes for 79 yards.
To go along with that, he completed five of seven pass-attempts for 65 yards and one touchdown.  The sophomore Rebel also added 94 rushing yards on 25 total attempts on the year.
It will be interesting to see how UCF head coach Gus Malzahn utilizes the new Knight in an offense where he often rotated multiple quarterbacks during the 2021-22 season.
