A 21-year-old woman driving in a downtown Orlando area popular with UCF students — Church St. and Garland Ave. — was shot and killed earlier this week after watching a fight on the street corner while stopped at a red light in her car. 
After KnightNews.com learned of the the violent act Orlando police said could have happened to anyone, we decided to stop by OPD headquarters to learn more about it.

KnightNews.com was the only media outlet to get a one-on-one interview with an Orlando police spokesman about this shooting.  
Below are images of the suspect vehicle released by Orlando police:
