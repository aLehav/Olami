“We are the future of college football,” words spoken by UCF head coach Gus Malzahn on ESPN’s “Our Time: UCF Football.”
In just his second season, the “Gus Bus” is already living up to his promise by assembling a 2023 class that is on track to break the school’s all-time recruiting record for the second year in a row.
Last year, Malzahn set the record by constructing the nation’s No. 41 ranked class in his debut season with the Knights. 
Just three months into the 2022-23 offseason, Malzahn and staff have already landed six early commitments for the class of 2023, including five three-star recruits and a four-star.
The group currently ranks No. 19 in the nation — a 22-spot improvement from last season’s record-breaking class.
The class is headlined by four-star edge-rusher Isaiah Nixon from Lakewood High School in Saint Petersburg, FL.  Nixon is the No. 266 player in the country and the No. 48 player in Florida.

Though listed as an edge-rusher, Nixon has put his catching abilities on full display by posting clips of his one-handed snags on Twitter.
The group also includes three-stars edge Kaven Call, edge Troy Ford, TE Jayvontay Conner, OT Jamal Meriweather, and QB Dylan Rizk.
“Everybody wants to be a part of something special and we are well on our way,” Malzahn said about the recruiting buzz following last weekend’s spring game.
