UCF pitcher and American Athletic Conference pitcher of the year Eric Skoglund was drafted no. 94 overall by the Kansas City Royals in the third round of the MLB draft on Friday.
Skoglund became the second highest drafted player in UCF baseball history, behind Matt Fox, who was drafted in the first round by Minnesota in 2004. 
“Such a blessing to be drafted and be apart of the Royals organization! Now the journey begins!” Skoglund tweeted out on Friday.
Eric Skoglund posted a 9-3 record this past season with 94 strikeouts and a 2.54 ERA. 
This isn’t the first time that Skoglund was drafted to the MLB–he was drafted by the Pirates in the 16th round but they lost his rights once he enrolled at UCF.
