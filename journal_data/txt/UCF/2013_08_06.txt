Grammy award-winning Matchbox Twenty frontman, Rob Thomas, called Teresa Dyer’s No Kill Brevard County saying he’d found a stray pit pull at a rest stop and now hopes that the animal can be found safe and given a home.
Dyer, the founder of No Kill Brevard County — which advocates for decreasing euthanasia of shelter animals — told Florida Today she received a call from Thomas around 12:30 a.m. Monday morning. He reported finding the stray animal after the band stopped following their performance the night before. 
“I answered the phone and he identified himself as Rob Thomas, of Matchbox Twenty,” Dyer told Florida Today.
Although skeptical at first, Dyer was able to confirm that is was in fact Thomas after watching YouTube videos of him speaking and matching the likeness of his voice to the phone call, Florida Today reported.
“The first thing I did was Google a bunch of different phrases and information he gave me, and it all panned out,” she said to Floirda Today.  “It still is a little surreal,” Dyer said. “… It’s still a little surreal that he’s asked me to contact him.”
According to the Brevard County animal advocates group, the dog was seen at a rest stop on I-4 Eastbound, mile-marker 46, when the band’s tour bus stopped there coming from their concert in Tampa.
Thomas posted several times on his Twitter page about the animal and the advocate group.  

According to Florida Today, Dyer has since called in “an army” of no-kill shelters and advocates from around the state to help find the animal. So far, the dog has not been found.
The dog is described as a Gray and white female pitbull with no no collar. It appears that she is a nursing mom and she may have puppies nearby.
