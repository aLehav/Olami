Tim Arnold talked with Knightnews.com about his recent punishment that he received from UCF Student Conduct for creating “U Could Finish,” an app that alerts students when there is an open seat in a class that the student is trying to get into.
Six days after Tim launched the site, it was taken down without any notice. After seven more days, he finally received a letter from the office of student conduct which made allegations of him interfering with normal University operations and violation of the use of Information Technology & Resources Policy.
At a July 24th conduct hearing, Arnold was found in violation of Misuse of Computing and Telecommunicating Resources(14g and 14i). Tim’s sanctions were harsh as he received a hold on his academic record, required to write two 5-8 page papers, and take a $15 dollar coaching session. On top of that, he lost his treasurer position in the Society for Marketing Professionals and is also in jeopardy of losing his spot in the Professional Selling Program.
Tim’s punishment has been seen as absurd by many, one 104.1 radio show host called him a genius and even offered to help him with a lawyer referral to appeal the decision.
Tim talked to us about how he felt about the decision and how he is going to try and appeal the decision watch the video below:

Notes:
-U Could Finish was an LLC that was shut down without notice.
-There was no ‘hacking’ into the UCF system to create the app, the information to find open classes was solely public record.
