One of the most popular UCF area bars was featured on NBC Nightly News Friday, in a story about George Zimmerman, the man who says he shot and killed an unarmed Trayvon Martin, 17, in self defense. 
The NBC story reported Zimmerman was arrested at Knight Library during an undercover sting operation UCF police were participating in to catch underage drinkers. Zimmerman was arrested for assault on a law enforcement officer, but the charges were later dropped.

According to documents obtained by media, Zimmerman wrote in an application to the Seminole County Law Enforcement Academy that he didn’t know the person he assaulted was an officer — and that the officer assaulted him first. NBC reported the officer did identify himself as an officer and showed his badge, however.
Zimmerman then seemed to try and add credibility to his story by throwing UCFPD under the bus in his application, claiming a member of the same undercover UCFPD unit was shot and killed by an Orlando police officer, because OPD couldn’t even tell the UCF officer was an officer when the UCF officer discharged his weapon during a 2005 tailgate party.
