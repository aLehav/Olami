Senor Frog’s. It’s a place many UCF students visited in the Bahamas, Mexico and Key West while on Spring Break. But it turns out, the most dangerous Senor Frog’s to be at during Spring Break may have been the one right here in Orlando. 
Sometime before 1 a.m. Sunday morning, someone was shot inside the Senor Frog’s on International Drive in Orlando, Orange County Sheriff’s deputies said. 
After that, Rush shot at the security guard several times in the lower part of his body, according to OCSO. The victim was rushed to the hospital, and the suspect fled before being arrested. 
The security guard’s injuries were not fatal. 
No one inside the restaurant was hurt, deputies said.
