The U.S. Naval Academy issued 233 credentials for its homecoming game on Saturday, October 21, against No. 20 UCF.
Navy said the number beat the amount of credentials issued for its annual rivalry game against Air Force on October 7 – 229 – a game it won by three points in a high-scoring game at Navy-Marine Corp. Memorial Stadium.

No. 20 UCF is favored by a touchdown in the matchup with head coach Scott Frost aiming to continue his undefeated season. Should UCF come out victorious, its position for a New Year’s Six Bowl (such as the Peach Bowl) will strengthen.
Navy’s only loss came down a 4th quarter decision in Tennessee against Memphis 27-30, an opponent UCF has not only faced but beat themselves. The defeat knocked the Midshipmen out of the top 25 and placed Memphis (5-1) at the No. 25 spot instead.
