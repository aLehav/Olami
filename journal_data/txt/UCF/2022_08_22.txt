UCF vice president and director of athletics Terry Mohajir said he believes this contribution will help continue the Universities commitment to serving their student-athletes. 
“We are grateful that Kristi and Gus made a commitment to help fund our ongoing efforts to further develop the Kenneth G.

“We’ve had a partnership with Addition Financial for nearly a decade, and we’re excited that Kevin Miller and the Addition Financial Board have agreed to extend our relationship for an additional 12 years,” Mohajir said. “This is a great new venture with outstanding community partners. Resources will be paramount as we transition into the Big 12 Conference a year from now, and Addition Financial will play a key role for us as we invest more resources to enhance our education and athletics missions!”

The UCF Football team made it official as Head Coach Gus Malzahn announced on his social media that the former Ole Miss Rebel will be the starting quarterback for the 2022 season beating out Sophomore Mikey Keene. 
Congrats @PlumleeJohn Go bring God the glory! Boom goes on & on!@UCF_Football “And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.”Colossians 3:23-24 NKJV pic.twitter.com/gxozGowVZm
Malzahn took to his official twitter account yesterday afternoon to drop the news that the Knights will be having a new QB under center as UCF enters its final season in the American Athletic Conference. 
Excited to announce @PlumleeJohn as our starting quarterback! #ChargeOn
The Ole Miss transfer is known for his athleticism, where during his time under center for the rebels ran for 1,023 yards and 12 touchdowns while throwing for 910 yards and 4 touchdowns through the air all while playing outfield for the college’s baseball team as well.  
Plumlee hasn’t started a game as QB since 2019 as he was beaten out of the position and moved to playing wide receiver for the Rebels for the 2020 and 2021 seasons. 
Plumlee will return to the starting QB position after beating out Sophomore Mikey Keene who stepped in to replace an injured Dillion Gabriel and started 10 games for the Knights last season. During his 2021 campaign, Keene passed for 1,730 yards, 17 touchdowns and six interceptions but struggled with his mobility outside the pocket.  
During his eight-year tenure with the Auburn Tigers, Malzahn preferred having dual threat QBs under center calling the shots and it was because of this Plumlee had the advantage.  
Plumlee shared his excitement about the possibility of playing QB again earlier this spring. 
“That’s where my heart’s always been growing up,” Plumlee said. “It’s always what I loved to do. To be able to do it again and to be able to get back behind center, it’s truly a blessing and something I love to do.” 
Plumlee will get that chance as the Knights take on South Carolina State at Home to kick off the 2022 season on Sept. 1.
