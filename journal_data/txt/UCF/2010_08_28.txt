A man grabbed a woman from behind and tried dragging her into a hallway just before midnight Friday at the Pegasus Landing apartments which were officially affiliated with UCF until just a few months ago, according to a UCF police alert. 
The woman who was attacked is not a UCF student, but many UCF students still live there. It’s not clear whether the victim is a student at a local community college. 
The suspect was 5′ 7″ or taller with dark or tan skin tone and was dressed in all black or blue clothing and a dark hoodie, the police alert stated. No other description is available at this time. 
UCF police still patrol the complex, and will step up patrols both on campus and at the Pegasus Landing and Pegasus Pointe Apartment complexes. UCF police alerted law enforcement in Seminole and Orange counties. 
Anyone that has any information about this crime can call Crimeline at 407-423-TIPS or the University Police Department at 407-823-5555.
