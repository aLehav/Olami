ORLANDO, FL — What seemed like a gleam of hope in the search for missing University of Central Florida graduate Jennifer Kesse turned up nothing.
Investigators launched a mass search for Kesse after receiving a tip from a caller. The search allegedly intensified when cadaver dogs signaled officers to an area of the empty field near where Kesse went missing four years ago.
Police remained tight-lipped about the tip and Orlando police Sgt. Barbara Jones confirmed on Friday afternoon that the search had concluded with no new evidence that would serve value to the search for Kesse.
Dozens of officers from the Orlando Police Department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement scoured the area off South Orange Blossom Trail north of West Oak Ridge Road.
Kesse graduated from UCF in 2003 and was a member of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority.
