Victoria King, the UCF student found guilty in the window-shattering case, was sentenced to one year of probation and 75 hours of community service on Friday.
On Sept. 4, 2013, UCF police body cameras caught King and UCF police officer Timothy Isaacs in an escalating situation when King refused to roll her window down during a routine traffic stop. King did not have proof of registration for her vehicle and when officer Isaacs tried to give her a ticket, the situation led to Isaacs shattering King’s window. 
She was found guilty of resisting an officer without violence and battery by a jury at the trial on Sept. 19.
“I’m happy with the outcome,” Isaacs told KnightNews.com while leaving the courtroom immediately following the verdict on Sept. 19.
When KnightNews.com asked King’s attorney Roger Weeden on whether or not there would be an appeal after the Sept. 19 ruling, he said that they would start looking into one.
