Now that Sigma Chi has moved out of its fraternity house, questions — and rumors — are swirling over whether anyone will move into the on-campus house this Fall, and KnightNews.com has obtained answers from UCF.
“A sorority is using the house for recruitment, but we are aware of no plans for a tenant for the fall,” UCF spokesperson Chad Binette said. 
KnightNews.com has learned from sources that the Delta Zeta sorority is discussing trying to sublease the house from Sigma Chi. It is not clear how far along those talks are. 
The house would have to be given up as early as the end of December 2014, because Sigma Chi could come back January 2015 at the earliest after their suspension is over. 
Sigma Chi’s housing corporation owns the actual house but UCF owns the land it sits on. 
KnightNews.com will continue to check with UCF officials to find out if a deal has been reached. 
Continue to check back for more information as it becomes available.
