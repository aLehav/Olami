Could Orlando be a part of a 51st state?
As first reported by the Orlando Sentinel, officials in Miami passed a resolution to split South Florida off into its own state and have Orange County as part of its northern border.
The resolution, which was proposed by Vice Mayor of Miami Walter Harris, passed with a 3-2 vote and was signed by Mayor Stoddard on Oct. 7.
The resolution cited concerns of having to travel to Tallahassee to address the needs of South Floridians, specifically impending global warming that may give rise to sea levels. According to the resolution, breaking off into a 51st state is “a necessity for the very survival of the entire southern region of the current state of Florida.”
The new proposed state of South Florida would consist of 24 counties with the northern border being Orange, Brevard, Polk, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties.
Breaking off into a new state means that South Florida would need the approval of the electorate of the entire state as well as Congressional approval before moving forward.
