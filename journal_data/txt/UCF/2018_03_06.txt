The Dominos pizza restaurant in the John T. Washington Center that will replace the Student Union cafeteria Dominos is now open for business.
A newer, cleaner look for the restaurant intends to invite students looking for dine-in lunch or carry-out pies.
Historically, the location has had trouble keeping a business. A Gamestop, women’s boutique, and more were previously hosted in the John T. Washington Center corner.
The cafeteria that held the previous Dominos, among others, will see an expansion to include Steak & Shake, Panda Express, Which Wich Sandwiches, to name a few, as part of the Student Union project. The completion will roll out in phases.

The Florida House of Representatives voted 113-0 on a transportation bill that included a “UCF Undefeated Champions” state license plate.
UCF was the only undefeated team for the 2017 season, taking down Auburn in the Chick-fil-a Peach Bowl on New Year’s Day.
A passing vote from the Florida Senate and a signature from Governor Rick Scott is needed before fans see the plate for sale.
The plate will be sold for $25.
