One of the most popular restaurants serving the UCF community is planning to move out on Sept. 30 of this year — but it may not be closing its doors for good. 
Lazy Moon Pizza announced that date on its Facebook page, along with some encouraging news. “We have some exciting prospects for a new location and like our dough recipe, we are keeping them top secret. When we settle on the right one, you will be the first to know,” the Facebook post stated. 
The pizza place known for its giant slices is making the most of its final summer in “The Plaza” across from UCF. 
“Come celebrate the last summer of Lazy Moon at its original location. If you’re passing by, stop in, if you’re not, make a trip to The Plaza and paint the town red with your fellow Knights to recognize the UCF culture that you have created; while helping carry on the tradition. Being part of the UCF culture has been Lazy Moon’s greatest achievement and something we want to continue without interruption,” the Facebook post added.
Lazy Moon is one of several shops planning to close to make way for a new luxury housing and retail complex. KnightNews.com obtained exclusive pictures of the facility replacing The Plaza, and information about the demolition timeline.
