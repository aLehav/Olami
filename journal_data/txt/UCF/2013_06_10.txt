On June 10, 1963, Florida Gov. Farris Bryant signed the bill that would create Florida Technological University. 50 years later, the now named University of  Central Florida celebrates its 50th anniversary as one of the largest universities in the nation.
UCF held a dinner fundraiser in the newly named CFE Arena on Saturday night to commemorate the university’s birthday. “A Knight to Remember”, the name given to the event that was attended by over 1,000 guests, celebrated UCF’s 50th anniversary with some of Orlando’s finest cuisine by the cities top chefs.
The event raised around $350,000 and the state’s first-generation grant program matched that to total $700,000 in first-generation student scholarships.
UCF spokesman Chad Binette told the Orlando Sentinel this is the largest sum of money UCF raised in a single fundraiser.
