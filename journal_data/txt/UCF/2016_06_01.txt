University of Central Florida President John Hitt will continue to head the nation’s second-largest public university another year, according to reporting by the Orlando Sentinel.
As a part of his contract extension, which expires June 30, 2017, Hitt’s salary will remain at $505,730, the Sentinel stated.
Also included in his contract is residence in the on-campus Burnett House and a vehicle which is replaced every three years with non-public money, according to the Sentinel.
“Presidential colleagues at other universities speak warmly of Dr. Hitt, describing him as the ‘senior statesman’ in higher education,” a report obtained by the Sentinel said. “As one president noted, ‘John is never the first to speak, but invariably the most influential when he does.'”
Hitt has been the head of the university since 1992.
