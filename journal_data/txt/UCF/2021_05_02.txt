Rookie guard Cole Anthony hit a game-winning 3-pointer with 0.1 seconds left on the clock to give the Orlando Magic a victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night at Amway Arena.
This was the second consecutive night for the Magic playing against the Grizzlies, with Orlando losing 92-75 in a game where both teams shot under 40% from the court. 
The first three quarters were much of the same for the Magic, which had the team struggling to find a rhythm offensively. The Magic shot 7-of-19 from beyond the arc for 36.8% and were being outscored in the paint, 46-32 to find themselves in a 20-point hole. 
The Magic offense came alive in the fourth quarter, where the team went on a blistering rally that was capped off when forward Moritz Wagner hit a 3-pointer with less than 1:30 in the game to tie it up at 109.  
Fans rose to their feet and cheered at the run the Magic were on to tie up the game, but after a couple of possessions, Grizzlies guard Dillion Brooks shot a jumper over the Magic’s Dwayne Bacon to take back the lead at 111-109 with 7 seconds left in the game. 
Anthony then responded with a jumper beyond the arc with less than a second left in the game to deliver the Magic a buzzer-beating victory that had fans throughout the Amway Center erupt in a boisterous celebration.

Anthony, a rookie who hit his second game-winning shot of the season said he was grateful to do so in front of fans. 
“That was an awesome moment right there,” Anthony said. “The first time I hit one there was no fans, so to be blessed enough to hit two game-winners in one season as a rookie doesn’t happen that much so I’m extremely blessed.” 
Acting Head Coach Tyrone Corbin said he believes that Anthony’s ability to deliver in clutch moments will continue going forward.  
“He likes big moments,” Corbin said. “I think that kid is going to do a lot of it in his career going like he’s been going these last couple months of this season.” 
Wagner, who signed with the team last week, collected a season-high 24 points in his third game with the Magic replacing an injured Chuma Okeke in the starting lineup. Wagner said he was impressed with Anthony’s play. 
“He has the right amount of craziness in him,” Wagner said. “I mean that as a positive. When he is aggressive, he’s great.” 
Anthony finished the game with a career-high 26 points, eight rebounds and six assists. 
With the win, the Magic improved to 20-44 on the season and snapped a nine-game losing streak at home. 
The Magic will travel to the Little Caesars Arena on Monday to take on the Detroit Pistons at 7 p.m. The game will be broadcast on Bally Sports Florida.
