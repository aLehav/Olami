Former UCF running back Storm Johnson participated in his first measurements and workouts on Saturday at the NFL Scouting Combine.
Johnson checked into the combine at 6-foot with a 32-inch arm length, 209-pounds and 9 1/2 inch hands. In his first workout, Johnson put up 16 reps in the bench press. Fellow big name running backs at the combine Jeremy Hill from LSU and Carlos Hyde from Ohio State put up 20 and 19 reps respectively.
Johnson will have a big test on Sunday, where he will test his 40-yard dash time against the other running backs at the combine. Just two years ago, UCF’s Josh Robinson led all cornerbacks in the draft with a 4.33 time in the 40.
This past season, Johnson was named an All-American Athletic Conference running back with 1,139 yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground.



UCF is bursting with leadership and potential, which is why February 24-27, the LEAD Scholars program, along with Student Development and Enrollment Services, will be hosting Leadership Week 2014. The theme this year is “The Gold Knight Rises, Rise to LEAD 2014.”
Leadership week consists of four days, seven key note speakers, and over 50 workshops.
Julie Deslauriers, the student director of Leadership Week and leadership development director for LEAD Scholars, has been planning this event since last March. Now, with the help of her committee and a lot of hard work, her vision for leadership week is ready to come to life.
“The purpose behind leadership week is to inspire every Knight to take the initiative and cultivate their innate leadership skills,” says Deslauriers. “UCF has so many opportunities available for students to be leaders on campus, and Leadership Week served to encourage and inspire students towards being a leader in their area of expertise.”
Some of the highlights of Leadership Week 2014 are:

On Thursday evening, hundreds of Greek and non-Greek students across UCF flooded into the Tri-Delt chapter house to enjoy all-you-can-eat pancakes, bacon and hashbrowns–all for a good cause.
The Delta Delta Delta sorority at UCF raised roughly $16,000 dollars with their annual DHOP event, standing for “Delta House of Pancakes”. According to their Philanthropy Chair Shelby Miller, the sorority has raised over $60,000 as a chapter for the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital over the past year.
As a national chapter, Tri Delta pledged to raised $15 million for St. Jude in five years, a goal they achieved in three and a half years.

The event was not just students eating pancakes and bacon to their heart’s content. DHOP also had DJ Chizzle spinning music, along with a pancake eating contest and raffles to win concert tickets and theme park passes.
