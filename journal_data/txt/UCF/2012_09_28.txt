As this year’s election approaches, Amendment 6 is still a heated debate.
According to the Say Yes On 6 campaign and writers of Amendment 6, the amendment was introduced to restore parental rights and protect taxpayers from funding abortions.
“It makes no sense that parents have to sign permission slips for field trips, or to take an aspirin, or to get tattooed, pierced,” said Deborah Shearer, Say Yes On 6 county field director. She continues, “The same law should be applied to minors getting an abortion. If there are any complications during the abortion, a parent should at least know what is going on, it’s a liability issue”.
Florida law already requires a parent to be notified 48 hours before performing the procedure on a minor. Former Governor Jeb Bush signed the law known as the Parental Notification law, SB 1908, in May 2005.
According to Lisa Murano, Deputy Campaign Manager for the Vote No On 6 campaign, requiring parental consent would endanger the safety of some teens, especially in families with sexual or physical abuse.
“Some parents might force a teen to carry a pregnancy against her will. And desperate teens do desperate things, like attempting to end a pregnancy themselves or even suicide. We need to keep our most vulnerable teens safe,” said Murano.
Amendment 6 also claims to addresses so-called taxpayer funding for abortions, despite the 1976 Hyde Amendment which limits funding to cases of rape, incest or life endangerment. In other words, taxpayer funding of abortion does not exist.
Shearer stated that this Amendment is not about denying rights, but seeing that taxpayer money doesn’t go towards something they don’t support.
“Its not right to put money towards something objectable, against my values and faith, and I think we have that right to voice our opinions,” said Shearer.
The Say Yes On 6 campaign is encouraging voters to vote yes to align Florida state law with existing federal law prohibiting public funds for abortion under the Hyde Amendment, extending to health care coverage that would include abortions.
According to Murano, this amendment is not about aligning state and federal law, but about politicians interfering with a woman’s right to make personal decisions with her doctor, her family and her faith.
“Let’s say what this amendment would really do and that is to take health care coverage away from the people we rely on every day like teachers, nurses, police officers and firefighters. Is that the way we want to express our appreciation for these pillars of our community? I don’t think so,” said Murano.



Fox News has just accidentally aired a suicide on live television during Shepard Smith’s 3p.m. news coverage show.
The story had been following a car chase in Phoneix, AZ and Fox failed to cut away in time as the driver reportedly left his vehicle, began running and eventually shot himself in the head.

Here is what Fox’s Shep Smith said after the mishap: 
“While we were taking that car chase and showing it to you live, when the guy pulled over and got out of the vehicle, we went on delay.
That’s why I didn’t talk for 10 seconds. We created a five second delay as if you were to bleep back your DVR 5 seconds, that’s what we did to the picture we were showing you so that we could see in the studio five seconds before you did, so if anything went horribly wrong, we would be able to cut away from it without subjecting you to it.
And we really messed up. And we’re all very sorry. That didn’t belong on TV. We took every precaution we knew how to take to keep that from being on TV. And I personally apologzie to you that that happened.Sometimes we see a lot of things that we don’t let get to you, because it’s not time appropriate, it’s insensitve, it’s just wrong. And that was just wrong. And that won’t happen again on my watch, and I’m sorry
We’ll update you on what happened with that guy and how that went down tonight on “The Fox Report.”
I’m sorry.
Smith at one point begins to scream “Get off it! Get off it! Get it off!” to someone off camera in an effort to pull the video feed however, it did not come in time. The studio was running on a five second delay.

KnightNews.com has learned that a recent UCF graduate, Brailynne Corr, has been reported missing after having not been seen for nearly 10 days.
Corr, who graduated from UCF last semester with her bachelors in Molecular and Microbiology, moved to Mississippi about a month ago to live with her parents and has now been missing since Sept. 15th.
It is reported that Corr told her parents she was going to Hattiesburg, Mississippi on September 15th to visit friends however, while she did go, she did not visit anyone. She was last seen two days later on the 17th at a Walmart 3 hours away from her home in Mississippi. Since then, there has been no form of contact from her and no use of her credit card. First Coast News spoke to Mississippi Detective Chris Ainsworth who said she is on the National Missing Persons List, but at this point he has no solid reason to suspect foul play.
A Facebook page has been set up as friends and family search for Brailynne.
She was last driving a 1999 GMC Jimmy Silver 4 door with RANKIN tag RGM837. Anyone with information should call 911.
