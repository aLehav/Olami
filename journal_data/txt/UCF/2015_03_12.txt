Hundreds of emergency personnel convened on the University of Central Florida campus Thursday morning to take part in a variety of training exercises, including an active shooter scenario. 

The regional exercise included practice events involving mass casualty and hazmat situations and an active shooter event — a situation known all to well to UCF, after an attack was thwarted in 2013. 
“What we’re doing is exercising not only the law enforcement element, but Fire, EMS and Emergency Management elements with this exercise…we’re really pushing all of our capabilities to the max,” UCF Police Chief Richard Beary said. 
In March 2013, the UCF Police Department thwarted a potential attack by former UCF student James Seevakumaran. UCFPD’s quick response is credited with preventing a possible shooting rampage. 



Tony Stark, the infamous Iron Man, along with a UCF student, presented a 7-year-old boy with a new bionic arm, similar to the one used on the actual suit.

Stark, A.K.A. Robert Downey Jr., and Albert Manero, a #CollectiveProject student who founded Limbitless and UCF aerospace engineering student, surprised Alex Pring with a new bionic 3D printed arm at no cost to the family. 
Similar type bionic arm given to Alex “Had the absolute privilege of presenting a brand spanking new 3D-printed bionic Iron Man arm to Alex, the most dapper 7-year-old I’ve ever met,” Downey Jr. said.
Last year, Manero and his team made headlines after 3-D building an arm for less than $350 for Alex. Normally a prosthetic arm costs around $10,000.
