The University of Central Florida’s Beta Theta Pi will host the annual Beta’s Best Dance Crew in CFE Arena Wednesday night.
UCF’s Greek Life will take part in a dance competition that will benefit the Ian Supra Foundation. Supra passed away in November 2015 after a battle with stage IV Esophageal Cancer that lasted two years.
Knight News interviewed Supra during his days as a star with the Dr. Phillips water polo team.
“The Ian Supra Memorial Foundation was founded by myself and a few others. Our goal is to support children, both financially and emotionally, who are fighting cancer,” Matthew Mayorga, one of Supra’s close friends, told Knight News.
Beta’s Best Dance Crew 2017 will be held at The Venue in CFE Arena. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the show will start at 7:30 p.m.

On Monday, Memory Mall showcased a helicopter, SWAT response vehicle, fire trucks, police vehicles, mounted deputies, and more in the Safe Knight Week carnival.
A series of interactive events intended to raise awareness about safety and well-being topics that the UCF community may encounter greet students during the week of March 6-10.
Students were given an opportunity to talk to Orange County Deputies about their Sheriff’s Office helicopter, Winter Park police and their SWAT response vehicle, and mounted deputies about their role in the community. These officers and deputies allowed students inside the vehicles posted and offered pictures to students wearing a bulletproof vest, and more.
Safe Knight Week will continue with Tuesday’s theme of violence prevention including the It’s On Us campaign walk that will leave from Ferrell Commons at noon. A self-defense class starts at 6 p.m.
Wednesday will offer physical and mental well-being services, such as HIV testing at the Recreation and Wellness Center and an evening healthy cooking competition, according to UCF.
Thursday and Friday’s events will focus on alcohol and high-risk behaviors.




On Wednesday, March 6, classes in the Summer 2017 semester and Fall 2017 semester will open to UCF students.
Student-athletes, Honors students, LEAD scholars, all Knightro’s, and so on, receive priority registration and may begin selecting classes early.
The majority of students may enroll based on class standing with seniors first followed by juniors, sophomores, and freshmen. Incoming freshmen will sign up for classes at orientation.

Each appointment includes a day and a time, different for each student, that classes may be enrolled. This time may be found in your MyUCF Student Center in the lower right-hand corner of the front page of your student center.


Registration for these classes begins Monday, March 20, by appointment. The withdrawal deadline will be on Wednesday, March 22, 2017.
