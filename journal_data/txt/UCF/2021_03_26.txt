The official Twitter account of the UCF Knights shared a graphic stating that 90% of 2021 season tickets at the Bounce House are sold out as of Wednesday. 
UCF said 22,536 tickets have been sold and 3,986 seats still remain of the Bounce House’s total capacity — 15,000 tickets are being allocated with 12,000 reserved for UCF students, and 3,000 set aside for the visiting team.
Despite the increase of football ticket sales, the university announced plans for a full return during the fall semester — the announcement of a full return currently does not include athletics.   
UCF Athletics also said some of the 22,536 total includes seats reserved for recruits and other university guests, and the total does exclude suites, lodges and ADA seating.
