Thursday marked the third round of orientations for the class of 2019, and KnightNews.com was there to interview the incoming freshmen.
We caught up with students who told us about their favorite parts of campus and their majors. KnightNews.com reporter Justin Levy got the approval from one set of parents to date their daughter.
As always, hilarity ensued when Levy interviewed the freshmen.

The University of Central Florida Chamber Singers will rock out with the Rolling Stones June 12th during the classic rock band’s Zip Code tour.
A group of 22 voice majors have been selected and rehearsing to perform one song with the band as a part of their North American tour which stops across 15 cities.
David L. Brunner, director of choral activities, said that all students performing were auditioned and highly selected from UCF’s chamber singers. He has been rehearsing with the 22 singers since before spring semester ended when they received the music.
The Chamber Singers have performed at national conventions, tourism functions, sporting events, with Vanessa Williams at the Daytona 500 race and recently, the UCF Celebrates the Arts festival held at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
“They are incredibly excited about this unique opportunity to perform with rock legends!,” Brunner said.
Brunner and the UCF singers performing were required to sign confidentiality agreements so they cannot speak about the concert or rehearsal time.
The Rolling Stones concert will take place at the Orlando Citrus Bowl which seats 65,000 people. The Zip Code tour began last week in San Diego.
