Tonight Pegasus Ballroom was filled with the glitz and glamour of pageantry as 16 lovely ladies competed for the title of Miss UCF 2010. In this competition, the judges look for a student of outstanding character; a well-rounded girl that shines in both the university and the community as a whole.

Academics, talent, activities, school involvement, community service and speaking skills were among some of the many categories that the contestants were judged upon before they made it to the finals tonight.
The girls had come a long way before they made it here. Countless interviews and auditions were required to narrow it down to the 16 finalists.
