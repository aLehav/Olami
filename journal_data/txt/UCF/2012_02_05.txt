Singer M.I.A. is at the center of controversy for flipping the bird during the Super Bowl halftime show, which featured Madonna, Nicki Minaj and others. 
M.I.A. also appeared to sing “I don’t give a (expletive),” during the show, around the time she displayed her middle finger to the cameras.

Madonna behaved during the performance, although at one point it appeared she stumbled while stepping up during the show. 



One year after Christina Aguilara became the center of controversy for messing up some of the lyrics to the national anthem, Kelly Clarkson gave a flawless performance to kick off Superbowl 46 between the New York Giants and New England Patriots.

Also performing before Clarkson was Miranda Lambert, who just performed at the UCF arena recently.

Clarkson was made famous on American Idol. Right now a UCF student, Johnny Keyser, is competing to be this year’s American Idol.
