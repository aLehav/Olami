UPDATE SATURDAY, 10:10 PM: We just received the following update via email from UCF: The Orange County Medical Examiner’s Office provided the University of Central Florida Police Department preliminary information about its investigation into the Aug. 20 death reported on the UCF campus.
Although officers found a .380-caliber gun in the car near the victim, and blood on the victim’s body, the Medical Examiner reports the victim suffered no gunshot wounds.
At this time, no foul play is suspected. But until a full report from the Medical Examiner’s office is finished and a thorough investigation completed, the death is classified as suspicious.
The next step is awaiting toxicology reports from the Medical Examiner’s Office to help determine a cause of death.
UPDATE SATURDAY: UCFPD sent out this message: “From yesterday’s suicide at UCF, the subject’s name is Troy Steven Smith from Apopka, 41 yrs old. No further details are available at this time.”
Several law enforcement vehicles, crime scene tape and TV news helicopters were visible on campus Friday afternoon while students moved into the dorms.

According to Heston, a passer-by called in to UCF PD at about 2:50, claiming a man appeared to be unconscious in his BMW. Police responded to find the man dead, with a hand gun and self-inflicted gunshot wounds.
UCF sent out text and email alerts, that stated, “Police investigating suspicious death near Millican Hall. Wounds appear self-inflicted. All campus operations normal. Updates to follow.”
All campus operations are normal.
Check back for student reaction, as well as anymore developments.



As parents cry and help their children move into their new dorms, we caught up with some students and talked to them about the process.
