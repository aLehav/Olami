University of Central Florida fans of The Simpsons, get ready to relive your favorite Simpsons moments this Thanksgiving break!
The Fxx Channel will be serving up all 600 Simpsons’ episodes in a 13-day marathon starting Thanksgiving Day at noon.
America first fell in love with this yellow family back in Dec 17,1989 when the very first full length Simpson episode “Simpsons Roasting on an open Fire” aired. From that moment on, the Simpsons phenomenon took off, and America couldn’t get enough.
“The Simpsons” have currently been on television for 28-years. That means that The Simpsons are older then most University of Central Florida Students.
Over the years this family has brought students at UCF and people worldwide countless laughs, cries, and great memories. That is why, so many people are excited to binge watch America’s classic dysfunctional family and can’t wait to see some of their favorite episodes!
Along with the marathon this Thanksgiving, every episode of The Simpsons is available anytime at http://www.simpsonsworld.com .
New episodes of The Simpsons air every Sunday on Fox at 8 p.m.
