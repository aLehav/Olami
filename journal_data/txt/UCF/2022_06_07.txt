SeaWorld Orlando is saying “thank you” to Florida’s educators this summer by letting Florida K-12 teachers free access to the park now till Aug. 31. 
Teachers will need to qualify for their free unlimited admission to the Orlando theme park by signing up for a SeaWorld Florida Teacher card on this website. 
Once Qualified, the teacher will be asked to visit Seaworld’s Official website to finish the ticketing process. Teachers will receive their tickets through email. 
In a statement on the SeaWorld Orlando Website, the company said they wanted to recognize the educators that play an important role in shaping the next generation of citizens. 
“Research and education are key pillars to the foundation of what SeaWorld does every day. In recognition of the importance SeaWorld places on education and the critical role educators play in shaping the knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the next generation of global citizens, SeaWorld will offer free admission for Florida certified K-12 classroom teachers to amplify their educational efforts both in and out of the classroom.”
