A controversial new flask designed to look like an iPhone so students can hide it from police patrolling for illegal drinking during tailgates is being marketed to University of Central Florida students. 
KnightNews.com has learned the developers of the “iFlask” are advertising the product online, targeting UCF students. In a promotional video posted on the iFlask’s kickstarter.com webpage, the product’s co-founders promote how the iFlask could help prevent police from giving out tickets during tailgates.  
The iFlask contains enough space to fill it with about five shots, according to co-founder Daniel Novaes, who although just recently graduated from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University in 2011, is not new to business. “Prior to inventing iFlask Daniel founded Elekteks Inc which produced over $2 million in revenues in 2011,” according to the iFlask webpage.
