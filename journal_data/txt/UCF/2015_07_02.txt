Stephen Schlow, 75, resigned Tuesday after being arrested as a result of “Operation Cyber Summer,” an investigation that was put together to bring people who attempted to sexually exploit children using the internet to justice, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
Schlow was a film instructor in the UCF School of Visual Arts and Design. He started in 2000 and become a full time faculty member in 2003, according to Orlando Sentinel.
Schlow was making $99,144 per year and previously served as an administrator for the film department, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
The investigation was put on by a total of eight Central Florida agencies. Law enforcement officers chatted, emailed, and spoke on the phone with subjects who they believed were communicating with a minor, or an adult who had a minor available for sexual activity, according to the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office.
Schlow was just one of the 12 amongst those arrested by the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office. Those arrested ranged in age from 17 to 75, according to the SCSO.
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also arrested 19 sex offenders who violated their probation in a separate investigation on Wednesday, according to the Sentinel.
