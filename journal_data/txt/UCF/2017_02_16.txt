After years of rumors and speculation, it appears plans for developing a hospitality institute in China may finally be gaining ground.
A letter to the Visa Officer of China was sent from UCF President John C. Hitt on February 7. In the letter, the university stated that they were submitting required documentation to Chinese government officials in order to obtain a visa to the country for a UCF employee.
The employee is expected to leave for China on February 18, and arrive in the country on February 19.
According to documents obtained by Knight News, it appears UCF hopes to establish locations in Shanghai and Hainan, an island province of China.
Knight News first reported on this story back in 2012, and now it seems that plans for the campus are underway again.
