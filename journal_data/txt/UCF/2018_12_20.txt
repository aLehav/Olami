Mililani High School quarterback Dillon Gabriel narrowed his future alma mater down to three – USC, UGA, and UCF – until the Hawaiian chose to call Orlando his second home Wednesday night.
Gabriel started for Mililani after Milton left for UCF, following close to his predecessor as a dynamic playmaker and future Knight. 
“Me and McKenzie talk every day. Him being there is a big plus…UCF is a place I want to be,” Gabriel said on signing day.

Head coach Josh Heupel addressed media and expressed how happy he was to have the signing class a whole.
“I’m excited that we were able to get a dynamic playmaker, someone that’s going to have a high ceiling at the quarterback position in this recruiting class,” said Heupel on Wednesday.
“It’s true just because you always need to recruit great players at that position. Ultimately your football team is going to ride their shoulders and it’ s certainly true with the injury to McKenzie and what happened at the end of the season. I couldn’t be happier about getting Dillon.”
McKenzie suffered from a devastating knee dislocation in the second quarter of the UCF-USF game. Second-string quarterback Darriel Mack, Jr. took the helm and finish the War on I-4 38-10 and the American Conference Championship 56-41.
During the signing period, Heupel reinforced the need to include a quarterback in this recruiting class while referring to Milton’s injury.
Mack, Jr. will lead the Knights in the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl on New Year’s Day against LSU.
