Now that USF’s Jim Leavitt has been ousted as the head football coach of the University of South Florida Bulls, following an embarrassing scandal where he allegedly attacked a player, it seems like the chances of restoring the War on I-4 are looking up.
According to the Tampa Tribune, UCF Coach George O’Leary gave USF’s new coach, Skip Holtz, a call within the last couple of weeks to get a feel for whether he’d be up to bringing back the rivalry.
How did USF’s coach react?
“I’m not opposed to it,” he told the Tampa Tribune, prior to leaving the Big East Conference spring meetings last Tuesday. “I like the geographical rivalries that it creates for your fan base.”
USF’s athletic director doesn’t appear to be opposed to it either, the paper reported. Although, USF clearly still does want to establish rivalries with the traditional Florida football powerhouses, like the Florida Gators up at UF, the Florida State Seminoles at FSU and the Miami Hurricanes.
KnightNews.com is still following possible NCAA football conference realignments as well, which could theoretically land both USF and UCF in the Big East together.
What do you think? Should this rivalry be restarted, or what?
