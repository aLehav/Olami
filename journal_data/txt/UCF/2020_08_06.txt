The UCF Knights landed the No. 21 spot in the preseason Amway Coaches Poll released on Thursday.
UCF ended last season ranked No. 24 in the Coaches Poll after finishing the season 10-3 overall and 6-2 in the American Athletic Conference. 
Only one other team from the American made the cut — the Cincinnati Bearcats took the No. 22 spot in Thursday’s poll. 
UCF marked its third straight season ranking in the preseason Coaches Poll on Thursday. 
In 2018, the Knights were ranked No. 23, while the team went into the 2019 season ranked No. 17, according to a UCF Athletics press release.
The Top 25 Teams are selected each week during the regular season by the Amway Board of Coaches, which is made up of 65 head coaches at Bowl Subdivision schools.
