Over 20 hours more than 1,000 students stood for Knight-Thon UCF and raised $1,250,961.21 for Children’s Miracle Network.
The new record beats Knight-Thon’s highest-ever fundraising goal of $1.2 million and becomes the seventh-largest dance marathon in the United States.
“I am beyond proud of our campus for pulling together for a cause that is so near and dear to our hearts,” said Knight-Thon executive director Brandon Kraut.
“Every year, we set an ambitious goal and every year our incredible Knight-Thon team and student body find a way to surpass our wildest expectations.”
