ALL NEW EXTENDED RAW VIDEO POSTED 8/25:


Hundreds of happy new sorority girls ran down Greek Park Saturday afternoon, taking part in a UCF tradition that kicks off their sorority life.
The new members had just completed a five day recruitment process, so freshmen with UCF’s class of 2013 had to move in early to participate. When they found out what sorority would be theirs, they ran together to the new house.
Their new sisters waited to greet them at their new houses, along with fraternity members who came to show support for their favorite sororities and meet the new members.
KnightNews.com has a crew on scene gathering video of the exciting day and we’ll have much more posted soon.
