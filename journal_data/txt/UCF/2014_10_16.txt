Apple held their latest press conference today, and amid the small updates, a few major announcements stuck out.
On the iPhone front, iOS 8.1, an update to the latest smartphone operating system, was announced. This update is hoping to correct many of the bugs that have been plaguing the device since the original release of iOS 8. 
Last month, Apple announced their answer to Google Wallet, Apple Pay. Apple Pay will allow owners of either the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6+ to pay for goods and services using just their phone–iOS 8.1 will include the update necessary to use Apple Pay. That update will be available on Monday.
The latest operating system for Apple Computers, Yosemite, releases today for free on the app store.
The new iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 were also both announced today. They will feature Touch ID, which was originally released last year for the iPhone 5S. Pre-orders will start October 17, and start shipping next week. The 32GB model for each will be phased out, which means you have the option of purchasing either device with 16GB, 64GB or 128GB of storage.
The iMac, Apple’s popular line of desktop computers got an update as well. The 27-inch model will now include a Retina 5K Display. It will feature a resolution of 5120 x 2880 for a total of 14.7 million pixels. This high end iMac model will start at $2,499 while lower, cost, models remain available. 
Finally, the Mac Mini received a price cut, along with a few performance improvements to wrap up the event.
