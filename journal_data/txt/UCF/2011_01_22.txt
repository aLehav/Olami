Update: Congrats to Phi Delt for winning the vote for best UCF fraternity pledge class.
We already showed you our first hilarious video from Wednesday night at rush, and a second one from Thursday is being finished up right now. We’ll post it for you ASAP, but in the meantime, we’re going to bring back our popular just for fun poll to let you vote on who got the best pledge class. 
Because we skipped the poll in Fall, this poll asks you to vote on which UCF fraternity had the best pledge class this entire school year — so consider both Fall 2010 and Spring 2011 pledge classes when voting. 
We’re also working our sources in Greek Life right now to find out how everyone did at rush. We’ll post our unofficial tallies when we get a good sample and idea. If you want to share information about your numbers, email us at news@knightnews.com. 
Don’t forget to like us on Facebook, to be the first to know about the major Greek and UCF news that everyone will be talking about!
Recommend this poll to your friends!
