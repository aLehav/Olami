The University of Central Florida football schedule has been released and both North Carolina and Pitt will be the Knights’ out-of-conference opponents alongside a fast-growing Florida Atlantic program and South Carolina State.
The 13-0 Knights have more than enough pressure to succeed, given a stellar 2017 performance and complete change in coaching staff.
UCF has had no trouble with UConn nor South Carolina State, historically, shutting out the Bulldogs in the 2016 season opener. North Carolina went 3-9 in 2017 and 8-5 in 2016. 
Florida Atlantic will be a bit of a wildcard (an exciting one nonetheless) with Lane Kiffin at the helm. The real test will be at home against Pitt who, despite going 5-7 last season, knocked off an undefeated Miami team during rivalry week.
Homecoming Week will feature Navy at home Saturday, Nov. 10.
