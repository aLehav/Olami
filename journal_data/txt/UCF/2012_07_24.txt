A video about the stuff UCF fans say is going viral.
ESPN is blogging about it, and UCF students and alumni are sharing it on their Facebook feeds. Why is it so popular? Well, a lot of the things pointed out in the video are truly things UCF fans say. Check out the video below.

It was made by Scooter Magruder, who tells KnightNews.com: “I’m a University of Florida graduate…but I have a lot of friends who went to UCF. I shot it this past Friday with the help of a couple of friends. I make “Stuff Fans Say” videos every Sunday and other videos on Wednesdays!”
KnightNews.com is working to set up an interview with Magruder, and will let you know the reaction he’s getting to this new video once we do.
