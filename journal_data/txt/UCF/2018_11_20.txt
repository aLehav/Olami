The University of Central Florida earned a No. 9 spot from the College Football Playoff Committee Tuesday night after dominating No. 24 Cincinnati (CFP) 38-13, allowing only one offensive touchdown.
The Knights jumped Ohio State despite a high-scoring-but-close win 52-51 against Maryland, the subject of scrutiny across commentators.

It’s been 23 games since UCF last saw a loss on their schedule and one downtown Orlando bar has kept its promise of free beer until the Knights lose.
The Basement Orlando has been known to support UCF with watch parties and other events, notably its promotion of beer.
The original offer was “Free beer until UCF wins” while the Knights suffered game after game in the infamous 0-12, 2015 season, a downward trend that business followed at the local bar. To bring life into the college football scene downtown, beer was given out from the time of kick-off until the last whistle.
The promise made over a year ago will stay in place until Orlando’s hometown team takes its first “L.”

Win or lose, the staff wants to see Orlando embrace UCF. 
 
“We have taken great pride in the team and we very much consider ourselves a UCF bar, as we’re operated and staffed by graduates and even some current students,” said Jake Whitacre, the bar’s marketing director, said to Knight News in 2015.
The War on I-4 kicks off in Tampa on Friday at 4:15 p.m. More than 50,000 tickets have been sold in the NFL stadium.
