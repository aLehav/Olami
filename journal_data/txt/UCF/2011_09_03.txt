First half recap
The Knights did not let the Charleston Southern Buccaneers pass for more than one first down in the first half. Jeff Godfrey tied the record for most rushing touchdowns by a UCF quarterback in one game, with three before the first half was over. Ronnie Weaver and Latavius Murray had a rushing touchdown each, and the UCF triple-headed rushing attack of Weaver, Murray, and Harvey is looking better than ever.
Blake Bortles, the true freshman Quarterback from Ovideo, made his first career appearance for the Knights at the end of the second half. Look to see the Knights go deep into the depth chart in the second half.
