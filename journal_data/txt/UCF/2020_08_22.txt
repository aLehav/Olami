UCF’s Sigma Nu fraternity is under conduct review after its national office informed UCF of an unregistered event that it claims violated curfew policies and social distancing regulations, Knight News has learned. 
Sigma Nu’s national office submitted a letter to the Office of Student Conduct on May 20 that detailed a Snapchat video sent by a member of its UCF chapter. Knight News learned about the incident while checking the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life website earlier this week.
“The video depicted to be at the Chapters house on May 9th with multiple unidentifiable members of Sigma Nu hosting an unregistered gathering …” the incident reporting form states.
It is not known if UCF has a copy of the video the national office viewed or if the conduct review is based solely off the letter. 
In the letter, Sigma Nu’s nationals told UCF it placed the UCF chapter on a temptemporary suspension, according to records.
Knight News reached out for comment, but did not hear back from the fraternity in time of publication.
