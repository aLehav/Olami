 
The University of Central Florida has stormed into the NCAA rankings, coming in at No. 25 in the AP top-25 poll.
After posting a 61-17 score against FIU, 38-10 score against the Big 10’s Maryland in College Park, and a pummeling of conference foe University of Memphis at home 40-13, the Knights have made a statement.

UCF has outscored its three opponents 139-40. Each of those teams has lost only to UCF. And up until garbage time at the end of the Memphis matchup, the Black and Gold held their opponents to only one touchdown.
Sophomore Adrian Killins was electric for the Knights, compiling 183 total yards and two highly impressive scoring plays – one through the air and one on the ground. Killins ran 96 yards for a touchdown, breaking the American Athletic Conference record for longest touchdown run from scrimmage while also holding the second-longest NCAA FBS run for a touchdown from scrimmage, currently.

ESPN Power Rankings had the Knights come in at No. 19 – three spots ahead of rival USF at No. 22.
“The Knights definitely look like a contender for the New Year’s Six,” stated the Power Ranking.
UCF forced four total turnovers when facing the Tigers: three interceptions and one fumble recovery. The Knights secondary more than held their own against a presumed future NFL quarterback in Memphis’ Riley Ferguson.
