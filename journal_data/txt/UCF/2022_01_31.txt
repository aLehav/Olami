And then there was one.
The 2021-22 NFL playoffs began with six former UCF Knights on rosters.  Only one reached a conference championship game.
That player was Kansas City Chiefs’ defensive back Mike Hughes, who earned First Team All-Conference honors in the American Athletic Conference during the 2017 season.
How did Hughes perform in the AFC Conference Championship game?
Hughes finished the game with just one assisted tackle in the Chiefs’ 27-24 overtime loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.
The Chiefs’ DB finished the 2021-22 season with 47 tackles, six passes defended, and an interception.  Hughes also forced a team-high four fumbles, ranking seventh in the league.
With Hughes and the Chiefs being eliminated, this leaves Los Angeles Rams’ tight end Jacob Harris as the lone UCF alumnus making a Super Bowl appearance.

Harris — who played wide receiver for the Knights from 2018-2020 — is currently on the Rams’ injured reserve list, which has kept him out of the postseason.
Kickoff for Super Bowl LVI is set for 6:30 pm.
