Jack Sweeney, the UCF student who rejected a $5,000 offer from Elon Musk to stop tracking his whereabouts, is now on to bigger and better.
According to the Huff Post, the freshman Knight discovered that jets owned by Russian oligarchs were traveling on a daily basis “despite harsh sanctions and restrictions placed on the country.”
The Twitter page, @RUOligarchJets, provides constant updates of take-offs and landings of the Russian elite and is up to nearly 243,000 followers.

Sweeney noticed a drastic difference in the Russian jets compared to previous jets he had been tracking.
“The aircrafts these oligarchs have are absolutely crazy,” Sweeney told Bloomberg, emphasizing how Russia’s richest people were traveling on commercial-sized aircrafts including the Airbus A319 and Boeing 737. “Their planes are huge compared to other jets.”
According to the page’s bio, Sweeney also has a separate page, @PutinJet, which is dedicated to “tracking Russian VIP jets and any Putin may use.”
The page was created on Feb 25 and is already up to 43,000 followers.
