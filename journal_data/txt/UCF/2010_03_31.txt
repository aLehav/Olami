What do free concerts, prize giveaways, photo booths, carnival games, philanthropy and gorgeous models have in common? Victoria’s Secret PINK Nation back-to-school bash! 
UCF is currently in the running for Victoria’s Secret to throw a free party on campus next fall. Last year the event took place at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. Students were treated to free PINK merchandise, games of corn hole and a football toss and photo booths set-up all over Dunn Meadow. A huge stage in the middle of the field is where students watched live performances by popular band Cobra Starship (“Good Girls Go Bad”), Girl Talk and local band Dot Dot Dot. The event was hosted by Victoria’s Secret PINK model, Behati Prinsloo, who was also joined by MTV The City’s Whitney Port. PINK also went the eco-friendly route; they brought along recycling stations in addition to accepting clothing donations. 
Voting is set-up bracket style (think NCAA March Madness, guys) and UCF has moved into the Super Sixteen, battling neck-in-neck with Rutgers for a spot in the Outstanding Eight. Super Sixteen voting ends tonight at midnight; if UCF advances, voting for the Outstanding Eight will continue from April 1-April 7, followed by the Fabulous Four (April 7-13), The Top Two (April 13-19) and PINK will announce a winner on April 20. 
You must sign-up for a PINK Nation account in order to vote and users are allowed one vote per day. At the moment in the competition, all four Florida schools (UCF, UF, FSU and USF) are behind in the competition. So sign-up and vote, Knights! Do it for me (and the models).
