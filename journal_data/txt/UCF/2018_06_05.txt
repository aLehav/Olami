The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple yesterday.
This case goes back to July 2012, when David Mullins and Charlie Craig asked bake shop owner Jack Philips to make a cake for their wedding and he refused citing his religious beliefs.
In a 7-2 limited decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated Phillips’ religious freedom in their decision against him.
In response to the ruling, which came on the 4th day of LGBT pride month, the Florida LGBTA Democratic Caucus which represents the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community to the Florida Democratic Party, issued a statement by their president Terry Fleming.
“In Donald Trump’s America discrimination is OK. Today’s decision by the US Supreme Court allowing companies to discriminate based on religious beliefs is unconscionable and should be unthinkable in the twenty-first century. No doubt this decision will embolden anti-LGBT activists who will continue their attempts to codify into law their hatred of our community. Every day, it seems America becomes a darker place,” Fleming said.
The Supreme Court said in its decision “The Laws and the Constitution can and in some instances must protect gay persons and gay couples in the exercise of their civil rights, but religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression.”
