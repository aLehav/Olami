Knight Nation saw two of its alumni — CB Rashard Causey Jr and C Jordan McCray — selected in the United States Football League’s (USFL) inaugural draft this week.
The Tampa Bay Bandits selected Causey Jr (2015-18) with the eighth pick of the 11th round.
Causey saw action in all four years with the Knights.  His most productive year came during his 2018 senior season — recording 48 total tackles (39 solo) and tying teammate Richie Grant for a team high three forced fumbles.
Causey broke up six pass-attempts, recorded two sacks, and recovered a fumble in addition.
McCray (2010-13) was snatched by the Birmingham Stallions with the fifth pick of Round 20.
During his four years with UCF, McCray earned a plethora of accolades, including Conference USA All-Freshman Team, All-C-USA Honorable Mention Status, and All-AAC First Team honors.
In a recent interview with “Inside the Knights,” McCray explained what the biggest moment for him was while playing at UCF.
“Most people say the bowl win against Baylor. I would say the biggest moment for us at UCF, letting us know that we could beat a team like that, is when we came back and beat Louisville,” McCray said.
“We were down 28-7 in the third quarter. They had Teddy Bridgewater (at quarterback) that was going to be a first round pick. We ended up still winning that game. I think it was 38-35. Just that comeback, how much fun I had playing in that game, yeah I would probably say that game.”
The USFL’s 2022 regular season is set to begin on April 16 and will run through mid-June, followed by the playoffs, according to Fox Sports.
The inaugural game will feature McCray as the Stallions take on the New Jersey Generals on April 16 at 7:30 pm.
