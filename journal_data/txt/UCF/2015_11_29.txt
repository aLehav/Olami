According to 247Sports, Bowling Green University’s Dino Baber will be announced as UCF Athletic’s new head football coach as soon as Monday.
“Multiple sources inform 247Sports’ Josh Newberg and Ryan Bartow that Bowling Green’s Dino Babers is expected to be the next head coach at UCF,” read a report on their website.
Babers ran a 12-4 record in Bowling Green’s football program over two years, making him an appealing candidate, the report described.

Dan Wolken from USA Today Sports tweeted in response to the news:
I’m told Babers and UCF isn’t done, per person with knowledge.

Babers would replace George O’Leary, who brought UCF’s football program to the Fiesta Bowl in its victory over Baylor in 2013. O’Leary announced his resignation from coaching in October, only a handful of games away from becoming UCF’s ‘winningest head coach’ at 81-68 since 2004.
BGSU football’s head coach currently has the nation’s highest ranking quarterback in passing yards and second highest in touchdowns under his wing at 4,465 yards and 41 touchdowns. The program is currently at 9-3 for the season and 7-1 in the Mid-American Conference, undefeated on the road.
This is a breaking story, stay tuned for updates.
