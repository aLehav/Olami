After a nine-day manhunt, the Orlando Police Department signaled the arrest of Lt. Debra Clayton’s alleged killer with a tweet.
“We’ve got him.”
Markeith Loyd was captured with body armor and two handguns shortly after 7 p.m. in an abandoned home, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said during a press conference. He faces charges related to the murder of Lt. Clayton last week and his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, in December.
Orange County Deputy Norman Lewis was also killed while responding to Lt. Clayton’s murder.
Both Lt. Clayton and Deputy Lewis were UCF graduates.
“I want to thank the Orlando Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff’s Department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for their unrelenting focus to find the person responsible for multiple deaths, including two honorable law enforcement heroes, Orlando Police Department Lieutenant Deborah Clayton and Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy Norman Lewis,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement.
This is a developing story.
