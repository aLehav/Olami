A home invasion was reported near off-campus Greek homes near the UCF main campus early Wednesday evening but officials later deemed it a false call.
 Police initially responded to the 12000 block of Napiers Circle at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house. 
Corporal Strickland of the Orange County Sheriffâ€™s Office told KnightNews.com that it was a false call on home invasion, and instead a drug related incident. Nobody was arrested during the incident.
