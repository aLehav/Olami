An email was sent to anti-hazing speaker David Stollman, by a person who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, that lists several forms of hazing performed against ATO pledges such as locking pledges into a room and forcing them to drink certain amounts of alcohol and beating blindfolded pledges as they performed wall sits in ice water.
“The only room I have gained knowledge of was where the pledge was blind folded, stood in a bucket of ice water in a wall sit. While doing the wall sits in the ice water, brothers were beating them while they had to recite their fraternity’s creed,” the complaint said.
A letter was sent to ATO on November 6 notifying them of their suspended status as an investigation is under way. ATO nationals is also conducting an investigation but at this time has no reason to suspect the allegations are true.
UCF spokesperson Chad Binette sent us this message: “We do not tolerate this type of behavior. However, we are pleased that this student came forward as a result of one of our many anti-hazing initiatives.”
Police are currently not investigating due to lack of information.
A hearing where the fraternity can petition to have the emergency suspension lifted until its final case is heard before the University conduct panel is set for Nov. 20 at 1 p.m.
