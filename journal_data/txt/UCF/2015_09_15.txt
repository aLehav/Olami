Continuing the efforts of Sept. 6-12 National Suicide Prevention Week, the University of Central Florida’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is holding its “Question, Persuade, Refer” or “QPR a Thon” on Sept. 16 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Student Union, 316AB. 
“Suicide is the second leading cause of death among college and university students, but it is also one of the most preventable causes of death,” according to the CAPS website.
“The program goal is to train faculty, staff, students, administrators, parents, and community members in how to effectively recognize and refer persons in distress to campus and community resources. As a result of QPR Training, you will: be able to recognize a crisis and the warning signs that someone may be contemplating suicide; be able to recognize the warning signs of suicide and how to apply three steps (question, persuade, and refer) with individuals in distress; have the skills to act with confidence to make a difference.”
The training session is a one-hour presentation where participants will learn the signs of suicide and the three basic principles of how to help save a life. 
The training begins at 9 a.m. with a new session starting at the top of each hour. The final
training will be offered at 2 p.m.



Today from 12-8 p.m., people can receive a free Chick-fil-A sandwich at the University and Rouse location.
In order to receive the free chicken sandwich, Facebook users must like the local Chick-fil-A Facebook page and share the post on their wall.
Both requirements must be shown to the cashier in order to receive the sandwich.
