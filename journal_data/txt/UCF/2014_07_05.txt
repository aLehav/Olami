UCF’s defense is already gaining buzz for this upcoming fall football season.
Senior linebacker Terrance Plummer and senior defensive back Clayton Geathers were named to the College Football Performance Awards watch list for their positions. Plummer finished this past season as the Defensive MVP of the Fiesta Bowl and led UCF with 110 tackles during the regular season. Geathers has 286 total tackles during his career at UCF, including four forced fumbles. 
The CFPA are aimed to provide the most scientifically rigorous conferments in college football. Recipients of the awards are chosen based on scientific rankings in which the player helps increase the overall effectiveness of the team. 
Geathers was one of 42 college football players to be on the defensive backs watch list while Plummer was one of 40 linebackers named to the watch list. 



UCF will make the transition to only using the NID login starting on Monday at 7 a.m.
Students trying to login to the myUCF portal, PeopleSoft, Webcourses or EZProxy(UCF library’s electronic resources) during the weekend may have noticed that the systems are disabled. UCF is currently in the transition period of making the switch and the systems will be available once again on Monday, July 7 at 7 a.m by using the NID login.
The university is hoping to help students avoid confusion and make logging into university programs easier with the one login and password. 
However, the PID is not gone forever. The PID will now be called UCFID and will be used as a student’s identifier to the university. 
If a student wants access to EZproxy during the weekend, the library ID number on the UCF ID Card will be able to provide access.
