The University of Central Florida women’s basketball team earned their best season since joining the American Athletic Conference, giving head coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson a new one-year contract extension through the 2022 season.
“I appreciate Dr. Daniel J. White, Brandi Stuart and President Hitt for their confidence in my staff and I,” Coach Abe said.”We are excited for the opportunity to continue building on the success from last season and look forward to
“We are excited for the opportunity to continue building on the success from last season and look forward to even more in the future.”
UCF went 21-12 in her first year, with a 10-2 season record at the beginning of the season, and a 9-7 record in the American, the team’s best yet.
As importantly, Abrahamson-Henderson led the Knights to defeat rival USF (No. 22 at the time) 66-62 for their first-ever win against a ranked opponent in Division I.
The team reached the 20 win mark for the first time since the 2010-11 season, according to UCF Athletics, and its first appearance in the WNIT. Two Knights earned all-conference accolades by the end of the season.

University of Central Florida Vice President and Director of Athletics Danny White signed a contract amendment that will keep White “in his current position for the foreseeable future,” said UCF.
“I hired Danny two years ago because he understood that success starts with winning with integrity and student-athletes thriving in the classroom, and because he had a strong history of hiring successful coaches,” said UCF President John C. Hitt.“Danny has exceeded my expectations in all of those areas while also leading athletics to its best year of philanthropy ever. Along with our fans and student-athletes, I look forward to seeing what Danny and his talented colleagues will achieve this year.”
“Danny has exceeded my expectations in all of those areas while also leading athletics to its best year of philanthropy ever. Along with our fans and student-athletes, I look forward to seeing what Danny and his talented colleagues will achieve this year.”
White took over as Director of Athletics after Todd Stansbury stepped down in 2015 to accept the same job at Oregon State, a previous employer.
Between White’s hiring in December 2015 and now, the UCF Athletics department has embarked on multi-million dollar projects and milestones that have brought the university to new heights.
“I’m honored to lead such a great athletic department and I look forward to doing so into the future,” White said.“We are committed to building a Top 25 intercollegiate athletics department at UCF. To be sure, I remain grateful to President Hitt for entrusting me with the leadership of this department. We couldn’t be more proud of what our amazing student-athletes, coaches,
UCF’s postseason appearances have reached an all-time high with 11 out of 16 teams making it beyond the regular season.
From UCF Athletics:
White has overseen transformational fund-raising success at UCF as well. During White’s tenure, UCF Athletics was the beneficiary of the largest cash pledge ever committed to the university by an individual alumnus and has seen more than $13 million committed toward UCF Athletics’ $25 million athletics village vision. Kenneth G. Dixon committed more than $5 million to establish the Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village. Tony and Sonja Nicholson recently donated $2 million to support the Athletics Village vision. John Euliano committed $1.5 million toward the renovation of the UCF Baseball Complex that will become John Euliano Park. Bob Garvy committed $1 million to establish the Garvy Center for Student-Athlete Nutrition.
UCF Athletics has recorded numerous other accomplishments during White’s tenure. He led the charge to complete The Knights’ Charge – UCF Athletics’ strategic plan. He was also behind many game-day experience improvements including new video boards and ribbon boards at both Spectrum Stadium and CFE Arena and the activation on IOA Plaza at home football games such as the Tailgate Concert Series and Knight Walk. Behind the scenes, White was responsible for the introduction of the Rise and Conquer Initiative, which will help UCF Athletics enhance funding for athletic scholarships and grow its operating budget through ticket sales, annual giving and corporate revenue. He also oversaw UCF Athletics transition to bringing its multimedia rights in house, creating an opportunity for enhanced revenue for the department.

The University of Central Florida President and UCF Student Government Association President have condemned the Charlottesville violence through a campus-wide email sent to students and faculty.
The UCF Student Body President Nick Larkins released an email early Wednesday morning, joining 104 student body presidents nationwide in condemning the violence.
“In response to the terrible incidents that occurred over the weekend at the University of Virginia, 104 Student Body Presidents from across the country publicly announced their condemnation of the hatred on display in Charlottesville, as well as their support for the citizens of the great state of Virginia. As the Student Body President, I was honored to pledge the love and support of the University of Central Florida toward all who were affected. The official statement is listed below.
 
As always, thank you for your continued support.
 
Go Knights! Charge On!
Sincerely,
  
 Nicholas R. Larkins
 Student Body President
 Member, UCF Board of Trustees
 Student Government Association
 University of Central Florida”
The president of the university followed in the same day with a message.
Dubbed “The Wrong Side of History,” UCF President John C. Hitt of 25 years enumerated the university’s opposition to ‘racism, bigotry, and hate,’ and strength in values such as equality, inclusivity, and respect.
The message has been reproduced below:
“The recent violence in Charlottesville was repugnant, and it stands as an anathema to the values Americans hold dear.
It is even more disturbing that so much of the violence occurred on a college campus — the historic and prestigious University of Virginia.
More frequently than ever, hate groups target public universities like ours because we vigorously promote free speech. That’s why I support what UVA President Teresa Sullivan said after Nazis, white supremacists, and anti-Semitic protestors stormed her campus.
What took place at UVA “wasn’t about ideas,” she said. “People weren’t out there arguing with each other. They were clobbering each other. That’s a very different situation. That’s violence. Violence is not free speech.”
I couldn’t agree more.
UCF stands alongside those who oppose the racism, bigotry, and hate seen in Charlottesville. These views are on the wrong side of history and have no place in our future.
We choose to side with equality, inclusivity, and respect.
In my lifetime, Americans have defeated Nazis, won the Cold War, and fought for equal rights for all.
Our progress toward becoming a more diverse and inclusive people is a strength of our great nation. Our embrace of justice and equality has been a beacon to others around the world.
These values represent the best of America. Let us strive to uphold these values in all we do, now more than ever.”
 
Aforementioned statement:
STATEMENT
As Student Body Presidents across the United States, we are deeply saddened by the events that have occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. We are united with the students of the University of Virginia, as what affects one of our campuses affects us all. College campuses are spaces that students should be able to call home, not places of violence, hate, and racism. Students should always feel welcome and safe at our incredible higher education institutions, never having to fear for their personal well-being. As the voice of our students, we collectively call on one another to speak up in the face of injustice, as silence reduces us to bystanders in oppression. This is a statement to not only support the Student Body at the University of Virginia but to make clear our advocacy for the victimized and marginalized students on all our campuses. We will continue to support students and universities in their peaceful resistance to violence, racism, white supremacy, bigotry, and acts of terrorism on our own campuses and beyond. If the students of the University of Virginia or the citizens of Charlottesville need any assistance, please know you have a network of universities that supports you.
