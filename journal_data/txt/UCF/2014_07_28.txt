Students making the commute to UCF this coming fall may have to leave for class a little bit earlier to make it on time.
Renovated McDonalds across from UCF campus.
A new traffic light is on the corner of Alafaya Trail and Strategy Boulevard, across the street from UCF campus and next to the new Plaza on University apartment complex.
The new light comes as the new apartment complex will house thousands of residents and the McDonalds, which was demolished in early May is set to re-open in coming weeks.
The McDonalds will have a double-sided drive-thru and an awning over the top of the drive-thru.
