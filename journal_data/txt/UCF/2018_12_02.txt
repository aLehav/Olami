The University of Central Florida will be heading to its second-straight New Year‚Äôs bowl and while it was expected, College Football Playoff Chair Rob Mullens explained the decision behind which bowl the Knights would play.
When Selection Sunday aired and Mullens was asked how the Knights, Florida, and Michigan were selected to their bowl, the Oregon Athletics Director explained:¬†‚ÄúMichigan is ranked No. 7¬† and deserves to play closer to home; UCF played in the Peach Bowl last year so it just made sense to place Florida in the Peach Bowl.‚Äù

UCF Football Denied Entry to Playoffs, Heads to Fiesta Bowl on New Year‚Äôs Day Against LSU




The University of Central Florida will head to the Playstation¬†Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona for its second-straight New Year‚Äôs Bowl after winning the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl in 2018.
No. 11 LSU (9-3) will play No. 8 UCF (12-0).
The No. 7 Knights completed the 2018 season 12-0 after handling Memphis 56-41 at home, coming back from a three-score deficit with backup quarterback Darriel Mack, Jr. while holding the Tigers to three points in the second half.
The back-to-back American Conference champions would be denied access to the playoffs as No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 4 Oklahoma secured the final spots. No. 5 Georgia and No. 6 Ohio State buffered the CFP against UCF, despite a vocal campaign from all the Knights‚Äô fans, administrators, and community the team and student-athletes deserve the chance.
It‚Äôs not a playoff. It‚Äôs an invitational. I‚Äôm excited to see what invitational we get to be a part of, and once again show what our team is capable of, ON THE FIELD! Proud of our team. Can‚Äôt wait to go bowling with #KnightNation!!!

UCF Athletics Director Danny White went on air in front of media to fight for the football program to be called into the College Football Playoffs given the success of the 25-0 program and the disrespect from the committee it has received over two years. Should UCF not be included, White says, it would be another glaring reason that the four-team playoff is inadequate.

One could argue the entrenched competitors in the College Football Playoff War Room decided UCF, or any ‚ÄúG5‚Äù team, would never get a seat at the table.
