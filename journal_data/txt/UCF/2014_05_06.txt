Not taking summer classes, but staying in the UCF area this summer and want to continue working out?
You have to pay to use the gym this summer if you are not signed up for summer classes. If you are signed up for summer B courses, you still need to pay the $50 fee if you want to work out over summer A. 
If you are taking summer classes and not coming back for fall you are not eligible for the summer membership.
The summer membership will cost $50 and students will receive a new summer membership card that will be valid through August 17. In order to sign up for IM Sports this summer, students will need to have a student ID and summer membership card.
Students signed up for summer B classes can work out for free during summer B, but if you want to continue working out over summer A you will need to pay the $50 membership and can request a refund after the summer B drop deadline.
The refund after the add/drop deadline will be at theÂ RWC Administrative Offices and can be received with a fee invoice and credit card.
