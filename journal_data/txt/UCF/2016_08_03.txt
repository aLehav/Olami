“It’s a brand of football people are going to want to watch”, Coach Frost said when discussing the Knights’ new style of play this upcoming season.
The Knights look to come back from an 0-12 season and remain optimistic that they will do so, despite preseason polls, which have the Knights finishing last in the AAC East. The USF Bulls placed first in the AAC poll, and are expected to win the East after going 8-5 last season.
Frost praised the effort his players have put in over the summer, and boasted their improvement. “We’ve gotten as good as we can get in 6 months without playing a game of football” Frost said at the AAC East Coaches discussion, “Now it’s time to play”. 
Scott Frost’s Knights have recruited well over a dozen three-star recruits – the most in school history, and alluded to several of the high-performers in practice seeing the field come opening day.
The Knights season opener takes place at home against the South Carolina State Bulldogs, where a large crowd is expected after attendance records shattered estimates in previous spring games with the 2016 spring football game drawing 23,000 attendees.
