Tanskley Efianayi, an Orlando native and a junior college transfer from Daytona State College, is starting to come into his own as a Knight.
“Most junior college guys that’s came in, it takes about a semester to figure out how to be everyday guys,” said UCF Head Coach Donnie Jones. “Tank has been better in practice. He’s been the best at practice, so his play on the court has showed how he’s practiced, its great correlation.”
Against George Washington at 9:44 mark in the first-half, one play shows Efianayi’s growth. With the shot-clock winding down, Effianayi almost lost the ball across the backcourt, but he maintained his composer, dribbled a few times and drew a foul on a three-point attempt and then proceeded to drain the three free-throws.
“I like how he’s starting to come along at the right time, here as we move into conference play, said Jones. “Cause we need that extra guy off the bench, here to give us some lifts when we need it.”
Efianayi had his best game this season against UCF’s toughest opponent thus far in George Washington. He was attacking on the offensive-end and scored his first three-point field goals of the season, going 2-3 from three-point range.
“It was nice to actually see them go down,” said Efianayi. “I’m going to continue to take them because I feel like I can knock those down.”
Efianayi has improved every game this season and he is starting to get more comfortable.
“My teammates stay behind me…you know the whole team has stayed behind me and just continue to give me confidence,” said Efianayi. “They know what I can do out there on the court. I just have to go out there and do it.”
