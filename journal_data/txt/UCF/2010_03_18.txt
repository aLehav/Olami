In an effort to raise money for pediatric cancer research, the St. Baldrick’s Foundation was out in front of the student union, collecting donated money from students. Although that was not the only thing the only thing they did to support children with cancer. Many brave souls decided to have their own heads shaved for St. Baldrick’s, symbolic of what the children feel when they lose their hair.

The event was run by very eager and upbeat volunteers who share a genuine interest for the cause, including some UCF students.
