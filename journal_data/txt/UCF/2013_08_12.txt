The Sigma Chi Fraternity at the University of Central Florida has moved out of its on-campus house, a spokesperson for UCF confirmed Monday.
UCF spokesman Chad Binette said that the fraternity moved out of its house on August 2. 
The Eta Pi Chapter of Sigma Chi was suspended last semester after being found “in-violation” of hazing, disruptive conduct and alcohol related misconduct by UCF’s Student Conduct Board. The fraternity was originally suspended through the end of Fall 2016, however, that suspension was lessened following an appeal. The organization is now suspended through the end of the Fall 2014 term.
It was not immediately clear whether a new tenant would move into the house or if Sigma Chi had plans to move back once its suspension is over.
