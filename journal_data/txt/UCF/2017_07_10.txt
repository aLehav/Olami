Stand-up comic and actor Adam Devine will be unveiled next week as the headline performer for UCF Homecoming’s Comedy Knight, Knight News has learned.
The co-creator of the Comedy Central show Workaholics will be opened by fellow comedian Adam Ray at the event, according to a press release by UCF Homecoming.
The press release was slated to be distributed on July 18, when UCF Homecoming plans to announce the names of the comedians on the Student Union patio, but Knight News obtained it and drafts of the event contract from the Office of Student Involvement.
“We are so excited to bring [the] Comedy Central star and hilarious personality for Homecoming Comedy Knight show,” said Homecoming Comedy Knight Director Brad Kuehler, according to the release. “Adam Devine is a well-known comedian in both TV and movies.”
Devine began his career in sketch comedy, where he found initial success on Myspace and Youtube. After a few small television roles, he helped create the hit series Workaholics, which aired for seven seasons and ended last March. He is currently the star of Adam Devine’s House Party, also on Comedy Central, and has a recurring role as Andy on Modern Family.
On the big screen, he is best-known as Bumper Allen from the Pitch Perfect series. His most recent film role was Lego Batman, as The Flash.
Adam Ray has worked with Devine previously, notably as a writer for Adam Devine’s House Party. Ray has been featured in movies such as The Heat and The Spy alongside Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig and joined the cast of the MadTV reboot on The CW in 2016.
Tickets for Comedy Knight will be available in late September, according to the press release. Students can take advantage of the 6,000 tickets allocated to them for free. The remaining 2,000 seats can be purchased by the general public for $25 at the CFE Arena box office or through Ticketmaster.
Doors open at 7 p.m. on Oct. 8.
