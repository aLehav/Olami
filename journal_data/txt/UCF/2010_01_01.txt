Connecting to Students with Content They Care About

When Knightnews.com launched just over one year ago, we promised to revolutionize how UCF students get their news, stay informed — and get entertained. In that short period of time, we’ve done that and more.

We introduced a 24-hour format of news coverage UCF had never seen before. By tapping into the popular social networking of Facebook.com, updating our feed with stories and videos that actually appeal to the average student, KnightNews.com quickly spread in popularity and reach, and is considered by many as the most relevant and popular source for UCF news.
It’s no secret that UCF students care about certain key issues more than others. Over the last year, here are some major stories, very important to students, we’ve covered that our competition has never even mentioned:
* Huge international drug ring busted, the kingpin of which is a UCF student
* UCF helped organize underage drinking stings, raids at popular local bars
* Popular student dies in double-fatal car crash behind campus | His memorial
* Sorority girl claims she was attacked, locked in back room by bar manager
Here are some stories we broke, that our competition followed, usually long after the fact:
* UCF fan charges field after historic win over ranked team, cops cuff him
* Vortex Amazing Guy, who ran popular UCF area attraction tried killing man, cops say
* Headline artists T-pain, Asher Roth party with UCF students at campus bars
Many of these stories represent some of our highest-traffic drivers we’ve had. In addition, our coverage of Greek Life philanthropies and events has become extremely popular, generating extremely high traffic. Organizations are now e-mailing us, begging we provide them coverage.

Recently, we co-sponsored this event with Alpha Xi Delta, and produced the above video on their behalf. In turn, they ran our 2009 year-end proof of performance video, and popular El Corral music  video that has over 9,000 views, and directed the thousands in attendance to visit KnightNews.com.
By covering news and providing content students care about, Knightnews.com is holding true to its promise to revolutionize news at UCF, and is becoming the mainstream news choice for students.
