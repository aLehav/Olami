The Republicans have released a controversial new video ad about President Barack Obama suggesting his promises for change and health care reform are fairy tales.

At one point in the ad, the announcer boasts: “Global warming has been solved by replacing cars with low-emmission unicorns, powered by the renewable energy of rainbows.”
The ad then cuts to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her failed presidential campaign. 
Said Clinton: “The sky will open. The light will come down. Celestial choirs will be singing.”
The ad goes on to say: “And now He has blessed us with free health care, creating trillions of jobs, without forcing us to buy health care.”
Eventually it the announcer says, “April Fools!” and goes into a standard attack-ad mode with menacing music and accuses liberals in Washington of having “No Transparency!”
What do you think? Does this ad go too far with hyperbole, or is it a clever way for Republicans to make a point? 
The ad only ran on the web and YouTube, but network shows have picked it up. It has more than one-quarter-million YouTube hits already.
