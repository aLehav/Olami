The opening of Scoop Orlando is just hours away.
The bar, which will be open every night aside from Tuesday and Sunday is opening in the Plaza, taking the place of where Deko Lounge was located.
Featuring multiple flat screen TV’s in a sports-bar-meets-club atmosphere, the bar is now big enough to have nine bartenders serving at one time. According to Scoop General Manager Mike Perez, the bar will play mainly Top 40 hits, steering away from Deko’s electronic and house music.
General Manager Jason Blank is anticipating the opening with much optimism.
“I expect the entire semester to be crazy. We are bringing back all the good things about Scoop that the people love.” said Blank, “I expect it to be a good college type of environment.”
The infamous Wheel is also making a return, with crowd favorites of a 50 dollar bar tab, free shots, and a 3-way kiss all as options.
As for tonight, the bar will open its doors at 8:30PM for the NCAA Football Championship game between Alabama and LSU. The bar is giving out free drinks all night with dollar Bud Light bottles and Coors Light Drafts. Both General Managers expect Scoop to reach full capacity quickly, so if you go out make sure to get there early.
