In their second consecutive away game, the Knights pulled out a 79-75 overrtime victory
Saturday night against the Houston Cougars, moving to 12-5 in all games played and 2-1 in
Conference USA play.
Isaiah Sykes put his best foot forward in Houston, leading the team with 22 points, 9 rebounds
and 4 assists. The red-hot forward sank all six of his free throw attempts over the course of the game as well, capitalizing whenever given the chance.
Team points leader Keith Clanton had another solid day as well, putting up 19 points and 8
rebounds.
UCF played catch-up during the entire second quarter after falling behind early in the second
half, managing to keep the score within five until there was only a minute and a half left to play, when Sykes knocked down two free throws.
Those two shots would be the last that landed in regulation, as neither Houston nor UCF was
able to generate any points as the clock wound down.
The defense pulled it together and was near impenetrable during the overtime period, allowing
only one three-point shot to be made and snagging four rebounds on defense to keep the Knights
in control of the ball.
The victory moved the Knights into fourth place in the Conference USA standings, closing the
gap to a game and a half behind division leader Southern Miss.
UCF will play their next two games at home, with the first on Wednesday January 23 at 7:00 PM
at the UCF Arena against the Rice Owls (4-13, 0-4 Conference USA).
