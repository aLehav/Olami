The UCF police department has received reports of a bear sighting on campus, including near Academic Village.
UCF sent out a community awareness alert this afternoon warning students to remain alert of their surroundings and to not approach, surprise, or intentionally attract bears if they were to come across one.
According to the e-mail UCF sent out, “if you encounter a bear at close range, remain standing upright, back up slowly and speak to the bear in a calm, assertive voice. Make your presence known, but do not make any sudden or abrupt movements. Back slowly into a safe, indoor place, and be sure the bear has an obvious escape route.” Finally, if you see a bear avoid making eye contact.
