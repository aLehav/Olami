It is a sad day for Hollywood and Star Wars fans across the globe.
Carrie Fisher, best known for her role as Princess Leia Organa in the Star Wars series died Tuesday morning after suffering a heart attack.
The actress, who was flying from London to Los Angeles, suffered a heart attack on Friday, December 23. Paramedics removed Fisher from the aircraft and transported her to the hospital, where she later passed away.
Carrie Fisher’s only child, Billie Lourd, confirmed that her mother passed away at 8:55 Tuesday morning.



Pack your bags.
The University of Connecticut’s football program has sent head coach Bob Diaco packing. On Monday, Diaco was informed of his termination after posting an 11-26 record over three seasons with the Huskies. 
The Huskies went 3-9 in 2016, and lost six straight to conclude their season with a conference record of 1-7.
One of Diaco’s most memorable moments against UCF was his attempt at creating the “Civil ConFLiCT” rivalry game. The UConn coach even had a trophy made for the game, etching the Huskies 2015 victory on the trophy as the first meeting of the rivalry.
But in 2016, when UCF defeated UConn 24-16, the Knights seemed not to care about the rivalry, leaving the trophy on the field.
It is unclear who will take over the UConn football program at this time.
Stay tuned to Knight News for continued updates.
