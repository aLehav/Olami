An armed robbery happened late Thursday night at the Circle K across from campus, the University of Central Florida Police Department said.
“A man with no UCF affiliation who was released from prison in May 2015 for aggravated assault and armed robbery charges robbed the Circle K on Alafaya Trail across the street from UCF and near the Knights Circle student housing complex,” a Campus Alert email stated.
UCFPD said he was taken to jail and no one was injured.
UCFPD assisted the scene and did not believe there was an imminent threat to the UCF community.
Many readers tweeted to Knight News wondering what all the cop cars at the Circle K were.

Stay safe Knights, UCFPD reminds students to be aware of their surroundings and to call them at 407-823-5555 to report any suspicious activity.
