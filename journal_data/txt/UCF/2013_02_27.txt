The University of Central Florida Police Department will undergo a review of its policies, procedures, management and operations by the Commission for Florida Law Enforcement Accreditation beginning March 11, UCF said in a recent statement.
“This voluntary accreditation process is an important tool to ensure that our department provides the best possible service to the UCF community,” said UCF Police Chief Richard Beary.
The public is able to provide written comments about the police department’s ability to meet the standards of accreditation. Letters can be sent to CFA, P.O. Box 1489, Tallahassee, FL 32302, or e-mail info@flaccreditation.org.
According to UCF, the police department must comply with about 260 standards to receive accreditation. Once the assessors complete their review of the agency, they will report back to the full commission, which will then determine if the UCF Police Department will receive accreditation, which is renewable every three years.
