Shaheed Davis has been a bright spot for the UCF basketball team this season. The senior, 6’9” 210-pound combo-forward is leading the Knights in rebounds per game with a 6.4 rebounding average. Also, he averages 10.5 points per game, which is third on the team in scoring.
Davis’ rebounding, scoring, and his ability to play multiple positions has been vital for the Knights and he helped surge the knights to a comeback win against Bethune-Cookman.
“He got underneath and played like a big guy,” said UCF Head Coach Donnie Jones. “I told him you gotta dunk balls, get underneath, and stop being a 6’9” two-guard.”
Shaheed answered his coach by dunking the ball numerous times against the Wildcats and finished the game with 20 points and four rebounds.
All of Davis’s baskets against the Wildcats seemed to come off dunks, but with 5:12 remaining in the game, Davis backed his man up and turned around and hit a fade-away jumper.
“Y’all don’t get to see too much of that, “said Davis. “But it wasn’t nothing, that’s a shot I can hit.
“That’s called the Heed, said senior guard Daiquan Walker. “He hit that all day in practice. We call that the Heed.”
After hitting the jumper, Davis turned to coach Jones as if to say, I can create my own shot.
“I was like, don’t act like you didn’t know I can make that,” said Davis. “Cause if I would of missed it, he [Jones] would have been all over me.”
