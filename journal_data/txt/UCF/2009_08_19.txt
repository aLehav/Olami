Hurricane Bill is one powerful storm.
Luckily for us, the major hurricane is not heading toward Central Florida.
And lucky for UCF surfers, the storm is expected to cause big waves along Daytona Beach this weekend.
While Bill should bring big surf and fun in the sun for us here at UCF, the island of Bermuda and even Boston, Mass., have both been holding their breath because they bordered the storm’s cone of uncertainty Wednesday.
As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, Bill boasted winds near 135 mph and was located around 1,000 miles southeast of Bermuda.
Earlier this week, KnightNews.com was tracking what was formerly Tropical Storm Ana.
As of 5 p.m. Monday, however, Ana lost its tropical status and NOAA stopped providing the ordinary tracking updates it generally does with organized tropical systems.
According to local weather reporters, however, the remnants of Ana could still bring rains to Central Florida this week.
The slow hurricane season suddenly sped up over the weekend, with a third system, Tropical Storm Claudette, coming on shore across the Florida panhandle with 50 mph winds Sunday night.
Central Florida was affected by tropical moisture associated with Claudette Saturday, but the system moved toward the panhandle and Alabama, so its impact on Central Florida and the UCF area was not felt much on Sunday.
KnightNews.com will continue tracking the tropics and will work with UCF officials to post alerts if a tropical system threatens UCF activities.
