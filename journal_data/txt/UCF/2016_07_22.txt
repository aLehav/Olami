Hillary Clinton made a stop in Orlando at the Holden Heights Community Center to meet with local leaders at a roundtable discussion on Friday July 22, 2016. 
Clinton was joined by Mayor Buddy Dyer, U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, and Orlando City Commissioner Patty Sheehan, among others. 
The discussion focused on the massacre that took place at Pulse Nightclub on June 12, where 49 patrons were killed and dozens more wounded in a mass shooting. Clinton met privately with the families and friends of victims prior to the discussion.
After the roundtable discussion finished Clinton made her way to Pulse to pay her respects. She placed a bouquet of flowers amongst the thousands of other tributes.  
The presumptive Democratic Nomineeâ€™s visit to Orlando is just one of three Florida stops. Clinton is to visit Tampa next for a rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds.
She will then make her way on Saturday to Miami for another rally at Florida International University Arena.
