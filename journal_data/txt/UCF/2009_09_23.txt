There comes a point in all our lives when we’ll become alumni of the University of Central Florida. Because of that, KnightNews.com is featuring advice from UCF’s Young Alumni Club, so all the Knights who will soon crossover to the “real world” have a sense of how to do it while still keeping UCF a part of their lives.
Our first column from submitted by Young Alumni Club Communications Chair Mark Justice shows us how young alumni tailgate after graduation.
From less time to hit the gym to inexplicably feeling like a nap in the middle of a Saturday night party, things had definitely changed. One of the biggest changes I found in my new life as a graduate was an increasing sense of distance between the university and myself.
By recently joining the Young Alumni Club I was able to reconnect with the UCF campus and ease my transition into professional life. The club provided the opportunity to meet other recent graduates who also shared an enthusiasm to remain a part of the UCF community.
My first event as a member of the Young Alumni Club was a patio party hosted at the Fairwinds Alumni Center for the UCF-Buffalo game. The patio party provided food, drink, and most importantly, a place for young alumni to connect.
While there was a mutual air of excitement about the game ahead, many of the young alumni in attendance were equally excited to learn more about the organization. At the event, I had the fortune of running into several old friends. Many of them had been feeling the same way I had, and were eager to become involved. Learning that our next event would be a Fall Knight Tour of downtown’s best destinations certainly didn’t discourage them.
The signature events organized by the YAC are diverse, and range from professional conferences to social gatherings and philanthropy. For most, these events are valued as an opportunity to reconnect with the UCF community and enjoy themselves responsibly.
