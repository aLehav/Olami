UCF student and Alpha Delta Pi sorority member died in a fatal car crash on Wednesday.
Kaleigh Ottis, 19, was an Interpersonal/Organizational Communication major and was enrolled in the University since summer of 2012.
UCF Spokesman Chad Binette said that UCF will be making grief counselors available for students who need them during a tragic time like this.
“Our UCF family’s thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Kaliegh’s family, friends and sorority sisters. Counselors are available to help students who need assistance during this difficult time,” Binette said.



The National Weather Service issued that Central Florida will be under tornado watch until 10p.m. on Thursday.
The weather service also issued a urban and small stream flood advisory for the Orlando-area due to the excessive amounts of rainfall. Local officials said patrons should avoid driving in puddles of water.
It is expected that Central Florida will be soaked with at least 3-6 inches of rain by Friday morning.
