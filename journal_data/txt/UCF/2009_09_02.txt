Here are their video responses, in order they replied to us:

A UCF Knight has died serving his country in Afghanistan.
UCF graduate Staff Sgt. Jason S. Dahlke, 29, was killed in combat Aug. 29.
Dahlke graduated from UCF in May 2004 with a bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice, according to UCF News & Information. He was from Jacksonville, and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, which is based at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia.
UCF flags were lowered to half staff today “to honor the memory and sacrifice” of the student, a UCF release stated.
One of those flags will be presented to Dahlke’s family.



Tropical Storm Erika formed Tuesday afternoon and was moving toward UCF, but by 5 p.m. Thursday had weakened to a tropical depression, and was expected to weaken further.
By Friday morning, it was no longer a tropical threat being tracked by NOAA.
Check back for updates as KnightNews.com tracks all tropical weather. We’ll work with campus officials to post information about precautions UCF would take, if any tropical disturbance is moving toward Central Florida.
