To meet the needs of additional food service options on the south side of campus, the University of Central Florida and construction crews have begun work on a standalone restaurant adjacent to the Leisure Pool and Recreation and Wellness Center.
The 3,200 square-foot building, to host Pollo Tropical, will aim for a LEED Silver certification for sustainability and appears to take a different look than the Caribbean-style food chain’s traditional restaurant exterior.
In 2013, the Neptune housing community opened and expanded to include 650 additional beds in the Nike and Hercules complexes. Over time, the need for food options available to students south of Gemini Blvd. grew, with Subway in the RWC as current closest choice, aside from ’63 South.
The building will be located near the UCF main-campus south housing communities and will also hold a Café Buestello, with Pollo Tropical holding the majority of the 3,200 square-feet of space.
Aramark will contribute $2.5 million to the $3.3 million project and completion of the restaurant will be near the end of January 2017, according to UCF officials.
Knights Plaza reopens in August to the campus after renovation began in late May. The project enhances beautification on the north side of campus.
