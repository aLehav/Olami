Stopping in Orlando tomorrow on their “It’s All Gold” tour, Family Force 5, the dirty South dance floor band will be playing downtown at The Social. Known for their thunderous beats and Southern-fried guitar, the band is currently touring the nation in support of their latest album, III. 
Incredibly interactive, FF5 is offering fun before each show they play. Those who arrive early will have the chance to participate in “The Gold Karaoke Challenge”, along with the opportunity to enter a drawing and potentially be one of five fans selected to perform a FF5 song with the 808’ers, an emerging production team who collaborated with FF5 on their newest album.
Tickets are on sale for $15. Doors open at 7pm. For more information please visit www.thesocial.org.
