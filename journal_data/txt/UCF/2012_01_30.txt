The Newt Gingrich campaign released Newt’s schedule to KnightNews.com, and on Monday he will be in Orlando. 
According to the campaign, Monday night’s Orlando rally will be called the “Crossing the Finish Line Rally,” and will include appearances by Gingrich and Michael Reagan. 
The Orlando rally is scheduled to start at 6 p.m. and should end by 8 p.m. It will be at the Renaissance Airport Hotel and 5445 Forbes Place, Orlando, FL. 
The rally is on his public schedule, so it is open to the public. 
Mitt Romney has had rallys in Orlando as well. KnightNews.com was there for his Friday rally. Check out the related posts on the right for a link to our video report on that one.
