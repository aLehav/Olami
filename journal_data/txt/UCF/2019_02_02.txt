A UCF student was arrested Thursday after allegedly attempting to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex, according to the Orlando Police Department.
According to an arrest affidavit, an undercover detective posted several online profiles to various websites and apps posing as a 14-year-old girl with the purpose of “seeking out those wanting to exploit children.” On Dec. 5, 2018, the detective received an online message from 20-year-old David Murray. 
The detective ‘immediately’ told Murray she was 14 years old, the affidavit stated.
Through a conversation that would begin online and evolve into texting, Murray went on to ask the 14-year-old ‘if she would have sex with someone she just met,’ later asking if she wanted to ‘sneak out and drink,’ according to the affidavit. The messaging from Murray continued through Dec. 7 and then ceased, stated the affidavit. 
On Jan. 27, Murray messaged the girl again asking for sex, stated the affidavit. Through a series of text messages and phone conversations, the detective posing as a child agreed. According to the affidavit, when the child asked how he would ensure she wouldn’t get pregnant, Murray answered he would “wear a condom” and “pull out.” During this conversation, Murray mentioned several times that “he did not want to get into trouble because he is 20 and the child is 14 years old”, the affidavit stated.
Police arrested Murray at an arranged meeting place within the Orlando city limits on Thursday. According to the affidavit, officers found him in possession of a condom at the time of his arrest.
Murray is facing charges of attempted lewd or lascivious conduct, solicitation of a minor via computer, obscene communication by traveling to meet after using a computer to lure, and unlawful use of a communication device, according to Orange County court records. He is being held in the Orange County jail on $10,300 bond.
