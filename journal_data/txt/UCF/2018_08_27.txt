Anyone on campus this past week has probably seen the green Lime bikes scattered around. UCF added the Lime bike sharing program as another transportation option to make it easier for students to get around campus.
“There is no cost to UCF for the Lime bikes and the service adds another environmentally friendly option for students, faculty and staff to commute,” Media Relations Coordinator Rachel Williams said.
Users will need to download an iOS or Android phone Lime app and setup an account to use the service. With the app users can find, unlock, lock and pay for the GPS and 3G-enabled bikes, according to a UCF press release. The bikes cost $.50 cents per half hour for students, faculty and staff. To get the discounted rate, setup the Lime account using your UCF email.
SGA’s free bike share program Black and Gold is still available for students and is being revamped as a more long-term rental service, Williams said.
UCF received 500 Lime bikes just before the start of the fall semester and will increase them, depending on demand, up to 1200, Williams said.
Lime is operating in 24 other colleges and universities across the country, according to their website. The bikes do not require a bike rack, however you’re encouraged to park near a bike rack or out of the way of traffic.
