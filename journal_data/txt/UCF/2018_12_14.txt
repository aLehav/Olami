Emergency surgery at Tampa General Hospital took place to restore blood flow to McKenzie’s leg after dislocating at the knee. Milton’s Thursday surgery was made to make him more comfortable and allow for travel to Arizona for PlayStation Fiesta Bowl that features UCF and LSU. At least one more surgery is needed to repair the joint; nerve damage and blood flow, though improving, still afflict the student-athlete.
