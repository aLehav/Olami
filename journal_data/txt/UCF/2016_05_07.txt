Graduates of the College of Sciences took the stage at the University of Central Floridaâ€™s 2016 commencement. Thousands of soon-to-be UCF alumni decorated their graduation caps to show to friends, family, and peers their time at UCF. A photo gallery of a small sample of two dozen caps expresses the creativity of these UCF graduates.
