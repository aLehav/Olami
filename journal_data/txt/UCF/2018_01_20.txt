University of Central Florida men’s basketball head coach Johnny Dawkins announced Saturday that junior Tacko Fall will be out for the remainder of the season after enduring a season-ending shoulder injury.
“It’s unfortunate for any young man to miss this amount of time playing the game that he loves due to an injury,” Dawkins said. “Our top priority at UCF is to maintain the well-being of our student-athletes, so our main concern right now is getting Tacko back to being 100 percent healthy.”
Fall battled through injury all season, UCF said, and will have surgery this month to repair the issue. The center is expected to make a full recovery.
“Injuries are unfortunate, but they are just part of the game. It pains me that I won’t be able to be out there and compete with my brothers, however I’ll still keep cheering and being the best teammate I can possibly be. Great things are still ahead for us,” said Fall.
B.J. Taylor returned against Cincinatti after recovering two months from an injury. The trade-off has been Fall.
No further information is available at this time, according to UCF.
