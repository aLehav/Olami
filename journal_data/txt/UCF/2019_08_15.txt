The Orange County Library System is launching what they call a Wanderer Pass, a new program offering free admission to many of the area’s local art and cultural venues.
Beginning this week, those with a library card in good standing are eligible for free visits to venues such as the Hard Rock Live, the Orange County Regional History Center, the Central Florida Zoo & Botanical Gardens, the Orlando Solar Bears, Orlando Science Center, and many more.
The growing list of participating venues can be found here.
Those interested in redeeming a pass can do so by going to www.ocls.info/local-wanderer, selecting a reservation date and venue, and entering their library card credentials. Once reserved, cardholders have a 14-day window to attend.
Some participating venues offer up to groups of three to join the cardholder.
According to the library system, the Wanderer Pass was inspired by New York City’s Culture Pass, a similar program offering big-apple locals free access to New York’s cultural institutions.
The catchy name, Wanderer Pass, was inspired by a line in a poem found in J.R.R Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings series:
“In creating our version of the program, we wanted to find a name that would convey the purpose of the project,” wrote Scottie Campbell from the OCLS blog. “To get Orlandoans to explore cultural offerings in their own backyard that they might not be aware of or might not otherwise be able to afford.”
