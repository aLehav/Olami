A federal judge has extended voter registration for six more days in the battleground state of Florida, due to the damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Matthew, according to the Associated Press.
U.S. District Judge Mark Walker extended the deadline until October 18 during a hearing Wednesday morning.

Walker had recently already extended the deadline from October 11 to October 12 after the Florida Democratic Party filed a lawsuit last weekend after Hurricane Matthew.
Democrats had asked Florida Governor Rick Scott to extend the deadline, but Scott denied the request saying people had more than enough time to vote, according to News 6.
Scott’s spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said Tuesday that the state would accept the court’s decision on the deadline. 
The governor’s office did not offer a defense Wednesday to keep the October 12 deadline in place.
