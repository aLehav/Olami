The University of Central Florida will not be extending the Fall 2017 semester despite speculation in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, according to a mass email.
An email sent to faculty and staff on Sept. 15 and later obtained by Knight News states that UCF has decided not to alter the academic calendar for the semester, but rather academic decisions “are best made at the faculty, department, or college levels.”
This decision has already impacted UCF students. “My flight is the day after my last final,” said computer science student Andrea Mungroo, a freshman out-of-state student. “So I’m happy the semester isn’t extended.”
However, the week off of school has already made it difficult for some students to balance their course work. “I’m happy because we keep our winter break, but disappointed because of multiple tests and rushed work,” Kyle Riedl, a freshman studying statistics, said.
“I’m upset with my English teacher, since she’s still having our paper due this week,” said Keesan Pascal, a freshman aerospace engineering student.
This is a decision that many Florida universities have faced after Hurricane Irma swept through the state. Last Friday, Florida International University announced that their academic calendar will be extended one week, while the student newspaper the Independent Alligator reported the University of Florida’s decision to not alter their academic calendar to make up for lost time. Other universities are still considering the option.
UCF is among several Florida schools to return to class on Sept. 18, including FIU, UF, Florida State University, and Florida Atlantic University. 
Professors are required to make any and all changes to their syllabi by this Friday to be “quickly and clearly communicated with students.” These changes may include lecture captures to “bridge critical content gaps” and potential weekend labs or studio work. UCF has also pushed back its grade forgiveness and withdrawal deadline to Monday, Nov. 6.
