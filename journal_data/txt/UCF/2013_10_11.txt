Tier Night Club in Downtown Orlando will not be receiving any bookings from UCF for social events.
Clay Coleman, the Director of Student Affairs for Fraternity and Sorority Life sent out an e-mail on Thursday informing organizations that Tier Night Club will no longer be an approved venue for UCF social events.
“Tier Night Club and their management have not been transparent and honored the requests agreed upon for a private social area at their club.  Instead, Tier management has allowed other parties and patrons at the club to join the private social hosted by a UCF chapter,” Coleman said in the e-mail.
Tier Night Club will remain an unapproved venue until an appropriate follow up with the management and proof of renewal of their liquor license.
We are working to request a comment from Tier.
