UCF Head Coach Greg Lovelady said he thought his team delivered on offense tonight after what he described as a terrible performance in Tuesday’s 6-7 loss against the Memphis Tigers. 
“I think, offensively, the guys knew that we needed more out of them,” Lovelady said. “They came ready to go.” 
The Knights will play the loser of game eight of tournament play between Houston and Memphis on Friday. UCF will take the mound approximately 47 minutes after the 1pm game Friday at Baycare Ballpark in Clearwater FL.
