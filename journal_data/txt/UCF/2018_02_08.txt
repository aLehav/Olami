University of Central Florida Director of Athletics Danny White announced to Knights fans a new milestone: 83% of UCF Football’s season ticket allotment has been sold.
While on the stage at Wednesday’s National Signing Day event, White encouraged fans to sell out the remaining 7,000 or so seats left in Spectrum Stadium.

The Knights finished the 2017 season as one of the best football programs in the country, certainly the most accomplished in university history. An undefeated season vaulted UCF to the national stage and prompted a “National Championship” title from administrators and state politicians.
UCF’s annual Spring game will take place in April. Josh Heupel takes the helm as UCF Football’s head coach.
I shared this last night at the Signing Day Social with Knight Nation, and I wanted to share it with you.
Very proud of that 83% number, and I know we can get it to 💯 with your help! #ChargeOnhttps://t.co/MtHrsuyVNn pic.twitter.com/XV1lVOteNl
