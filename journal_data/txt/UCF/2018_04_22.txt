A 25-year-old man was arrested early this morning after reportedly driving under the influence and wrecking multiple cars inside the phase two parking garage at the Marquee apartment complex, according to a Florida Highway Patrol arrest report.
According to FHP Lt Kim Montes 16 vehicles, including the suspect’s vehicle, were involved in the accident.
Vehicles on multiple floors of the parking garage were damaged.
A witness saw James Edward Morris running from the scene of the accident, who was then held by a UCF security officer, the arrest report said.
When the FHP trooper on scene found Morris, he was asleep on floor of the garage, where he told the trooper he “doesn’t want any problems,” the arrest report said. 
When asked what happened, Morris said he didn’t remember, but that he had gone to Knight’s Pub and that he only had “one shot of captain.” The trooper noticed Morris’ eyes were bloodshot, his speech was slurred and his breath smelled of alcohol, and he later admitted he was given free drinks, the arrest report said.
Morris refused to undergo voluntary field sobriety tests, as well as breath test. He was arrested on DUI and hit-and-run charges, according to the arrest report.
Residents at the Marquee received emails this morning informing them of the accident, and encouraging residents to speak to management if their car was damaged. The complex’s management and FHP documented all of the damaged vehicles, and all but a few of the vehicle’s owners had been contacted, according to the email.
Morris was booked in the Orange County Jail, but has since bonded out, according to a tweet by Spectrum News 13.
