The UCF police officers accused by Dr. Jennifer Lisa Vest, a mixed-race philosophy professor, of engaging in racial profiling when they pulled her over were cleared of criminal wrongdoing by Orlando police. 
UCF officials announced that they invited Orlando police to conduct an independent review of the controversial traffic stop in the wake of a media firestorm that erupted after after KnightNews.com first broke the story in August.
UCF President John Hitt was joined by Orlando police Chief Val Demings and UCF police Chief Richard Beary at a news conference on campus Thursday to announce the results of the review. 
The officials noted that Dr. Vest refused to return multiple contact attempts by those conducting the investigation into her allegations to tell her side of the story. 
One UCF police officer, Donnie Freeman, admitted he told the professor, “I don’t care who the hell you are, I’m going to treat you the same as everybody I… I deal with.”
It’s not clear what — if any — punishment he’ll face for using the improper language. 
KnightNews.com was at the press conference, and we’ve posted the entire raw video of it below:
