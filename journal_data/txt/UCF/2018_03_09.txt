The University of Central Florida has selected Dale Whittaker to succeed Dr. John C. Hitt and his 26-year tenure.
Whittaker currently serves as Provost and Executive Vice President. 
The president-elect will need to be confirmed by the Florida Board of Governors before his position begins July 1, 2018. An interview will take place and a final decision will be made in a confirmation vote on March 29.
“What excites me most about UCF is the opportunity that it creates for so many to become so much through innovation; through a youthful, high-energy spirit; through resourcefulness; and through this aspiration to be the best it can be,” Whittaker said.
President Hitt wrote a heartwarming letter to Whittaker for the announcement:
