Goodman’s attorney, Roy Black, sent KnightNews.com the following statement regarding the trial verdict:
“It is our belief that multiple errors were committed during and before the trial that, in effect, denied our client’s ability to get a fair trial. We intend to file an appeal so that our client can receive the just and fair proceeding to which he is entitled by law.”
