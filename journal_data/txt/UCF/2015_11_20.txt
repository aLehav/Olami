At noon on Wednesday students gathered in the Student Union as part of a sit-in to show support for the Mizzou protests known as Concerned Student 1950. Knight News reported from the student Union and interviewed both leaders and participants of the movement.
The movement, which began at the University of Missouri in early November, has since spread across the nation to dozens of Universities. The movement protests social injustice and racial inequality, and at the University of Missouri, led to the resignation of President Tim Wolfe.

The University of Central Florida affiliated housing NorthView was the scene of a believed drug related incident, according to Seminole County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kristen M. Bentsen.
“We received a call just after 2:30 a.m. this morning in reference to possible drug activity occurring at the complex. Upon arrival, deputies located a man inside his apartment with a non-life-threating stab wound to the face/head,” Bentsen said.
SCSO said they found the suspect in the clubhouse/recreation room not long after.
The suspect and victim know each other and the victim is not wanting to press charges, according to Bentsen.
After calling NorthView, KnightNews.com received no comment on what happened.
