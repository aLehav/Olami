Former UCF quarterback Blake Bortles has inked a deal with Nike, according to NFL.com.
Bortles joins Johnny Manziel as the only other quarterback in the 2014 draft class that has signed a deal with Nike. Former Louisville safety Calvin Pryor and former Vanderbilt wide receiver Jordan Matthews have also signed deals with Nike, according to NFL.com.
This isnâ€™t the first endorsement deal for the ex-UCF star. Bortles also has deals with New Era and signed a trading card deal with Upper Deck.
Bortles has been speculated to possibly go No. 1 overall to the Texans and is widely considered a potential top 10 pick. The NFL draft starts on May 8.
