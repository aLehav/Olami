A man found sleeping in his car at Knights Circle apartments was wanted for a sex crime, police report.
On July 6 UCF police arrested Shawn Hamilton, 29, on a warrant from Orange County regarding a case in April where he was accused of having sexual contact with an underage girl, according to a police report.  
UCF police patrolling Knights Circle apartments at around 10:30 p.m. found the man sleeping in the car with three children in the back, according to the police report. Police reported that two of the children were sleeping and one was playing games on a cell phone.
The three children were released to the custody of their mother, Hamilton’s girlfriend, according to police reports.
Hamilton was booked into Orange County Jail on charges of lewd or lascivious battery and lewd or lascivious exhibition. No bond was set on these charges as of press time. 
According to investigators Hamilton admitted to having sexual contact with an underage girl. 
In an unrelated case, last January, Hamilton was charged with cruelty to animals, he plead not guilty. The case is still pending.
Knights Circle is managed by UCF Housing and therefore under UCFPD’s jurisdiction, said Courtney Gilmartin, UCFPD spokeswoman.
