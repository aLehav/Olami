The University of Central Florida’s President-Elect Dale Whittaker conducted his first interview with five student media reporters in a panel discussion, where Whittaker expressed his desire to have meaningful and personal relationships with the UCF student body.
Whittaker called the student body at UCF “uniquely engaged, uniquely influential and uniquely powerful,” praising students for their ability to express their voices through student media, student government and having a member of the student body on UCF’s Board of Trustees, a governing council of the university.
“Very few universities have students that initiate so much and are so important,” Whittaker said.
Whittaker also reflected on the lessons he learned from President John C. Hitt and his time in leadership, focusing on integrity and collective wisdom.
“One of the things that President Hitt has done remarkably well is identify talented people, and kept them engaged with each other, supporting each other’s agendas,” Whittaker said. “It’s how we’ve grown so strong, so fast.”
Whittaker elaborated on his plans to bring new ideas to UCF, including being more external facing and engaged with the student body, and being more engaged with university stakeholders and business community in order to increase the prospect of careers for outgoing students.
Whittaker plans along with his wife, Mary, to engage with students in both informal and formal settings, to recognize the contributions the student body makes to the university as a whole.
“It’s really hard to be intimate with 66,000 people… so one of the things you’ll find me committed to is a social media presence. Just so in a sense you can keep up with what I’m doing, and when you want, you can have the opportunity to tweet back,” Whittaker said.
Whittaker’s Twitter profile currently has 2,143 followers, and he has tweeted multiple times, sometimes several times in one day, since his announcement as president-elect.
Though he plans to continue to use Twitter presence to interact with students, he said he believes that interacting online is not the same as meeting face-to-face. 
“It is not about photo-ops, and snaps, it’s really about listening and having the time to understand,” Whittaker said.



The University of Central Florida Police Department added a new cruiser to its fleet – this time, with a UCF Football National Champions wrap around the patrol car.
It’s not the first time UCF PD has used a special-edition wrap on patrol cars. The police department also has cruisers featuring recruitment, anti-drunk driving, a Pulse Orlando tribute, and more wraps.

Update: Sage is in second place and will compete in round two of the finals on Friday night.
UCF Mathematics major Hannah Sage will compete in the $100,000 Jeopardy! College Tournament Finals Thursday night.
Sage completed the Semifinals with $28,400, beating the second-place winner by $400. Sage represents one of three public universities in the competition.
Original story:
University of Central Florida student Hannah Sage easily won on Monday in the Jeopardy! College Tournament.
The honors mathematics major went against two students from Rochester University and Stanford University, going into Final Jeopardy with $19,000 and winning with $17,000. The final question for Sage was to determine which president had taken the oath of office twice in 14 months. Sage incorrectly answered with Grover Cleveland, with the correct answer as Lyndon Johnson.

“I am incredibly excited to represent UCF on the Jeopardy! College Tournament and I hope I did my fellow Knights proud,” Sage said, representing one of three public universities in the competition. “It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I couldn’t wait to share it with everyone when it aired.”
Sage prepared for Jeopardy! with the UCF Quiz Bowl team, according to UCF, and traveled around Florida battling other college teams. The National Merit Scholar began her journey with an online test of 50 questions with 10 seconds to type each response. According to UCF, her stellar score allowed her to audition in Atlanta and after passing the second stage, Sage participated in a mock show.
After an interview with producers, Sage was told she would be contacted if selected for a show. Sage received the call and invitation during the final exam period in Fall 2017.
“The honors program has helped me prepare by allowing me to have a great education and diving further in depth on topics that interest me — and helped me grow my passion for learning and trivia,” said Sage to UCF. “LEAD Scholars has taught me about my own leadership style and given me my self-confidence to work toward my goal of being on Jeopardy!”
The semifinal round and two-day final event remain. If sage wins the grand prize, she will put the prize money toward travel and her education. 
 “I want to go to Italy to see all of the art in person, rather than the tiny photos in my textbooks,” said Sage. “Then I’d probably save a chunk of that for medical school — I want to be a dermatologist.”
The semifinal episode will air the week of April 16 on ABC.
