All UCF activity will conclude Friday at 5 p.m. and remain closed through Tuesday, Sep. 3, as Hurricane Dorian is now expected to impact Florida as a Category 4 storm.
Now moving through the warm waters of the Atlantic, Dorian is forecasted to threaten the Sunshine State with an upward of 130 m.p.h winds and heavy rain, according to the latest projections by the National Hurricane Center.
Floridians can expect Dorian to make landfall early Monday morning but will begin experiencing tropical-storm-force winds as early as Sunday evening, wrote NHC Director Ken Graham on Twitter. 
According to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, a category 4 hurricane with winds ranging from 130 – 156 mph can result in catastrophic damage to property and infrastructure.
“Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed,” the NHC says of storms of this strength.  “Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.”
As Dorian moves pass the Caribbean, Florida Governor Ron Desantis has declared a state of emergency and readied the Florida National Guard. In a morning press conference, Desantis urged residents to begin preparing themselves as gas shortages are already being reported in neighboring Brevard County.
