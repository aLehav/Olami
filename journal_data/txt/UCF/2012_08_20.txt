On Saturday morning, Greek Park was filled with every sorority anxiously awaiting the arrival of their new sorority sisters.
Sorority rush lasted all week, with hundreds of young women trying to find the sorority that was the perfect fit for them. It all came to a conclusion on Saturday, when the girls ran from the Student Union all the way down to Greek Row to the Sorority they chose.
This year was different than last year, because fraternity members were able to greet and congratulate all of the new members as they ran to their houses. Hundreds of fraternity members stood on the median in Greek Park and clapped and cheered as the new members ran by.
Afterwards, Greek Park was promptly cleaned up, and the event as a whole was a success. Watch the video below to see some of the girls running to their new houses!
