UCF may not have a say in whether or not the campus is gun free or not.
Florida’s First District Court of Appeal on Tuesday handed out a ruling against the University of North Florida saying that Florida universities cannot enact gun regulations on campus. A UNF student challenged the rule, which prevents students from bringing guns to campus even when the gun is left securely encased in a car, similar to UCF’s policy.
The court ruled that the Florida Legislature has pre-empted the regulation of guns by local governments, which includes state universities.
In the conclusion, the court ruled a policy enacted by a state university, “to the extent it prohibits possession of securely encased firearms in motor vehicles, is illegal and unenforceable.”
UCF has stood by its policy banning guns on campus after the Tower 1 incident earlier this year.
UNF has no released comment on whether or not they will appeal this decision, and KnightNews.com is currently waiting on comment from UCF.
