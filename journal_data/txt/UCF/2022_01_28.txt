One of the wealthiest and most successful entrepreneurs in the world has reached out to one of UCF’s very own.
UCF freshman student Jack Sweeney was reportedly asked by Tesla CEO Elon Musk via Twitter DM to stop tracking his private jet, according to Fox 35 Orlando.
Sweeney had the courage to tell the billionaire no.
The freshman created a Twitter page “@ElonJet” dedicated to tracking Musk’s private jet and posting its whereabouts.

“He reaches out to me, and he asked ‘Can you take this down?’ Then he was like, he doesn’t like the whole system, calling it primitive and everything, then he offers me $5,000 to take it down,” Sweeney told Fox News.
The page claims to track the plane and “not who may or may not be onboard.”

In an exchange between the two, Musk told Sweeney “I don’t love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,” after asking the freshman Knight what he should do, according to Fox 35.
The conversation came to an abrupt ending after Sweeney asked the Tesla CEO to up his original offer of $5,000 to $50,000 and an internship.
Sweeney’s page is still up and active after Musk refused to budge.
