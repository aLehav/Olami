UCF SGA senate elections are starting today and going through Wednesday at 5 p.m..
Students can vote by signing into my.ucf.edu and clicking on the SGA logo.
This year there are two referendums on the ballot, in addition to the candidates running for senate.

The first one has to do with graduate funding and the second is asking students whether they are in favor of an alcohol emergency policy (AEP).
AEP is a weaker form of medical amnesty that does not include protecting students from school punishment for saving their friends that are overdosing on all drugs, but instead only protects students who have been drinking alcohol.   
Support for reforming UCF’s alcohol policy has grown in the wake of Ann Hefferin’s death, who died after a fraternity party. It’s still not known, however, if alcohol contributed to her death.
