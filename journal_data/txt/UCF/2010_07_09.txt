Knightnews.com has learned from a close source of Kappa Sigma Fraternity that a decision on their appeal should be coming in the next couple of days, possibly as early as today. As the case progresses, we will continue to update you on the final decision and its consequences.
Knightnews.com first broke the story regarding Kappa Sigma losing their charter here http://knightnews.com/2010/05/ucf-kappa-sigma-charter-revoked/.
See the letters from Kappa Sigma Nationals:  http://knightnews.com/2010/05/9223/
The source revealed that if the Lambda Epsilon Chapter of Kappa Sigma were to win their appeal, the chapter would most likely consist of 25-30 brothers. These brothers would mostly consist of those who attended Conclave (National Fraternity meeting with different chapters) in New Orleans and/or have been involved with the appeal process.
Knightnews.com has also learned that the Lambda Epsilon Chapter had thousands of dollars of debt, owed to their Nationals and their Housing Corp. They have paid it back before awaiting the results of their appeal, according to the source.  They collectively raised the money by collecting dues from brothers and donations from alumni.
