The Knights have lost one of their own.
University of Central Florida student Brooke Dawkins passed away Wednesday March 5 after succumbing to injuries she sustained after being hit by a car.
An update posted by Brody Dawkins, Brooke’s brother, on her support page stated that she was declared “medically brain dead and has ascended from this life into the next.” Florida Highway Patrol Public Affairs Officer Kim Montes confirmed that the Brooke had passed away.
“Per her wishes, Brooke will donate her organs to give the gift of life to multiple recipients across the country. She will give others a chance at life and its all we could ask for,” Brody Dawkins said.
Brooke was involved in an accident on Feb. 23 when she walked out into the path of a Toyota Pickup truck at the intersection of Alafaya Trail and Gemini Blvd. 
Students and friends, along with the UCF community, offered mountains of support to Brooke and her family over the past week — even helping to raise money to help pay for medical bills. 
“From now on, instead of praying for Brooke, you can pray to her. She will be listening, and she will be with us always,” Dawkins said.
Friends, family and the community can leave comments below remembering Brooke and offering kind words and support for her family during this time.
