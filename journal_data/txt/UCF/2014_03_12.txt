In October, CAB released a survey to allow students to vote for their spring semester speaker. The speakers ranged from popular shows such as American Horror Story to even Catfish. In the end, UCF picked Josh Radnor, known for his role as the lovable Ted Mosby in the Emmy Award-winning CBS hit show How I Met Your Mother.
On top of being an actor, Radnor is also a director, producer, and screenwriter.
He will be speaking on Tuesday, March 18 at 8:00 p.m. in the Pegasus Ballroom.
Radnor will be coming to UCF just two weeks before the How I Met Your Mother show finale, which is set to air March 31.
No tickets will be distributed for this event. It is first-come, first-serve seating.
The doors of the Pegasus Ballroom will open at 7:30 p.m. with the event following at 8. If you are an avid fan and hope for a seat, plan on getting there early.
Up until the event, CAB will be hosting several contests for a chance to win VIP meet and greet passes.
