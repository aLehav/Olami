WFTV interviewed a long-time UCF fan that graduated back in 1979. He talks about the changes in UCF football between then and now, and how he’s donating tickets to members of the military at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. 
A UCF athletics official tweeted that at least 200 tickets had been bought by UCF fans and donated to Luke Air Force Base. Check out the video story, below.
