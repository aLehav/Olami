Orlando gave the University of Miami a farewell as the Russell Athletic Bowl champions, leaving West Virginia with a farewell of their own after a 31-14 victory.
A No. 14 ranking among the best college football teams didnâ€™t give the Mountaineers any greater advantage against Miami. A quick draw by West Virginia in the first half foreshadowed an easy victory to alumni and the like, although the Hurricanes responded with dominance through the end of regular time.
A proud and boisterous Miami-side stadium characterized the performance, with a West Virginia-side stadium cheering their own in between.
