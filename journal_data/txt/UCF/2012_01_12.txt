The UCF Police Department has released a list of sexual predators/offenders employed or enrolled to the University of Central Florida.
A Florida law requires offenders to register with the Department of Law Enforcement and notify them of their place of residence. The state has set up a website that includes a searchable database for interested parties to view names, addresses and convictions of offenders.
The UCF Police Department has created a list to alert students about the offenders who live near the UCF campus in order to keep students safe.
Check out the UCF Police Department page to view registered offenders in the state and near the University of Central Florida campus.

A controversial blog post is asking whether Denver Broncos Quarterback Tim Tebow is the Antichrist. 
Barstool sports points to different prophecies about the antichrist, which it suggests may match with the former Florida Gator star.
For example, the blog points to this passage: “The Antichrist will ride in on a white horse [Revelations 6: 1-2].” Then it shows the white horse on the Denver Broncos logo. 
Given Tebow’s devout Christian faith, even raising the question his supporters deem so absurd is sure to stir controversy. What do you think? Share your comments below. You can read the full blog post by Barstool Sports here.
