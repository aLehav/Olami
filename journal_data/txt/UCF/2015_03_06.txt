Have any questions about the proposed UCF Downtown campus?
UCF is offering students to come voice their questions and concerns at an open forum on Wednesday, March 18 from 2 to 3 p.m. in the Student Union’s Cape Florida Ballroom (Room 316D).
On Feb. 19, UCF presented to the Florida Board of Governors and received an initial vote recommending $2.77 million be funded by the Legislature, allowing UCF to keep planning a downtown campus. 
The total cost of UCF Downtown campus would hover around $200 million and could eventually move about 13,000 students to downtown Orlando. Programs that would be moved include the entire Nicholson School of Communication, digital media, art and film.
The proposed campus would be placed where the old Orlando Magic arena was, in the open area between Amelia and Robinson street. 
When KnightNews.com was in Tallahassee this past week, Florida Gov. Rick Scott did not answer our reporter’s question on whether he supports UCF Downtown. 
In addition to the UCF Downtown campus, parking, student services and housing will also be addressed during the forum.
