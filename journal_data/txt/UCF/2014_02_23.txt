Kappa Delta sorority sisters have started selling “#BrookeStrong” tanks to help the Dawkins family with medical bills, less than 24 hours after a tragic car accident hospitalized Brooke Dawkins.
“These tanks that have been made are in honor of helping Brooke and her family pay for the medical bills and out-of-pocket costs associated with the surgeries she will have to undergo and for the weeks that she will remain at the hospital,” according to the Brooke Strong sales website being shared by her fellow Kappa Delta sisters.
The shirts are being sold for $15 each, with $10 going directly to the cause, according to the website.
“The tanks for this order will be placed on Wednesday and will arrive in Orlando on Friday, February 28th. All tanks can be picked up from Kappa Delta Sorority that upcoming week,” the website says.
Tanks can be purchased here to support Brooke and her family during this tough time.



KnightNews.com has learned that a member of the Greek community and a sister of the Kappa Delta sorority was involved in an accident on Sunday morning.
The crash happened at 2:33 a.m. on Alafaya and Gemini. The Florida Highway Patrol says Brooke Dawkins, 19, is currently in critical condition at Orlando Regional Medical Center.
“According to the trooper the pedestrian walked out into the direct path of a 2007 Toyota Pickup truck driven by 35-year-old Reginald Smith from Geneva,” said Sgt. Kim Montes of the Florida Highway Patrol.
The sorority has taken to Twitter thanking the Greek community for their support for their sister.
“Thank you for keeping our sister Brooke in your thoughts. Every prayer counts. Love in AOT,” Kappa Delta said on Twitter.
Members of the Greek community have used ‘#PrayForBrooke’ to show their support.
“Stay strong KappaDeltaUCF, our thoughts and prayers are with you all today. #PrayForBrooke #BrookeStrong,” the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity tweeted.
