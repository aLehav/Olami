KnightNews.com’s Alex Koenig dug up some of the biggest concerts coming to the University of Central Florida Arena this Spring and Summer.
One of the biggest names getting buzz on Facebook is Wiz Khalifa’s concert on 4/20. KnightNews.com teamed up with Bezz Believe to make a UCF version of Khalifa’s “Black and Yellow” song we called “Black & Gold.”

See the list of artists Koenig put together below:
 March 5: Kid Rock- Grammy Award nominated, multiplatinum singer-songwriter/rapper will bring his country-fried rock and roll to the UCF arena, sure to perform mega-hits such as “Bawitaba,” “Cowboy,” and his worldwide #1 smash single, “All Summer Long.”

 April 5: Furthur- Following their successful summer and fall tours, former Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh and Bob Weir emerge with their new band Furthur. Their set will likely please Dead Heads and fans of jam bands.
 April 20: Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller- Is it coincidental that Wiz Khalifa, one of the most famous stoner rappers in hip-hop arrives in UCF on 4/20? Wiz, known for his signature chuckle, is surely going to be even giddier than usual during this performance. Opening for Khalifa is Jewish American rapper sensation Mac Miller, who is probably going to be just as throwed as Wiz.
 May 9: Avenged Sevenfold:  The California five-piece bring their guitar-fueled hard rock to the arena. This band will appeal to fans of heavy metal and hardcore music.
 June 9: Katy Perry: Sexy singer-songwriter, known for her hits  “Hot n Cold” and “Teenage Dream.” Be careful for your eyes at this show though, as her outfits are known for being brighter than the spotlight.
