UCF stand-out cornerback and AAC Co-Defensive Player of the Year Jacoby Glenn has been honored once again this season for his efforts in the UCF secondary.
Glenn received a spot on the Associated Press All-America Second Team on Tuesday, the first Knight named to the prestigious list since running back Kevin Smith in 2007.
A sophomore from Prichard, Ala., Glenn ranked third in the nation with seven interceptions and third with 18 passes defended. He was one of 50 student-athletes to be named to either the AP All-American First or Second teams and was just one of 13 underclassmen named to the list.
With only two seasons under his belt, Glenn is already sixth in UCF history with nine interceptions. His seven this season is one short of tying the single-season UCF record for interceptions held by Keith Evans.
UCF will be back in action for the Bitcoin St. Pete bowl game against NC State on Dec. 26 at 8 p.m.



UCF students coming back to campus in spring will see a speed limit decrease on parts of the main campus, according to an e-mail sent out by the UCF Police department.
Starting this week, roadways on Gemini Boulevard, near Greek Park, the CFE Arena and Orion Boulevard that had 35 mph speed limits will be lowered to 30 mph.
Roadways that already had speed limits under 30 mph will not be affected by the speed limit decrease.
According to UCF News and Information’s Courtney Gilmartin, UCF is looking to make the university a golf-cart community, giving more road access to faculty and staff that utilize golf carts on campus. Dropping the speed limit is one step in the process to legally allowing golf-carts on more of the main campus roads.
“The process is ongoing and subject to approval, and we will notify the campus community when everything is finalized. For now, we’re in the process of updating signage in the impacted areas and getting the word out about the changes,” Gilmartin said.
