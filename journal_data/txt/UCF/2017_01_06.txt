Memory Mall will open up tailgating not just for football in the academic year, but basketball as well.
With a start date of January 14, 2017, UCF basketball fans will have an opportunity to tailgate ahead of tipoff on  Memory Mall when UCF plays at home. This tailgate series will run through January and February, four hours prior to game time.
“Not many campuses across the country have the kind of weather to make tailgating a possibility during the basketball season,” UCF Director of Athletics Danny White announced Friday. “This is going to give our fans a unique experience that can be found very few places, if any, throughout the collegiate basketball landscape.”
Four American Athletic Conference weekend games run through the series:
–          Sat. Jan. 14, vs. Houston (4 p.m. game, tailgating opens at noon)
–          Sat. Feb. 4, vs. Memphis (5 p.m. game, tailgating opens at 1 p.m.)
–          Sat. Feb. 11, vs. UConn (6 p.m. game, tailgating opens at 2 p.m.)
–          Sun. Feb. 26, vs. Cincinnati (3 p.m. game, tailgating opens at 11 a.m.)
“Registration for each tailgate will be open to UCF students and anyone with a ticket to that day’s game (season or single game). It will open at 6 p.m. on the Sunday prior to the game,” UCF stated.
“Also featuring a live DJ on the mall, UCF fans are encouraged to bring tents, chairs, food and coolers to enjoy one of the truly unique experiences in college basketball.”
Fans can register at Knightsonthemall.com.
The first 500 students in attendance at January 14’s tailgate will receive a brand new Knightmare t-shirt, according to UCF Athletics.
