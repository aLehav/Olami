UCF officials notified the Greek community that two chapters in Greek Park were placed under quarantine on Friday evening, and said consequences will come to chapters who violate the rules. 
The email — addressed to chapter officers, members and leaders — was sent on Saturday afternoon. It is not known which Greek chapters are currently under quarantine at this time. 
Maribeth Ehasz, vice president of Student Development and Enrollment Services, said in addition to the two chapters, it “seemed that other chapters have had social events” that increase the risk of spreading COVID-19. 
Ehasz cited no specific examples.
“Your actions will determine how successful our on-campus experience will be at UCF,” Ehasz said in the email to the Greek community. 
Ehasz said if members of the Greek community are not able to follow UCF’s guidelines, the entire campus community will be impacted with very real consequences.
“Those consequences include your chapter’s future at UCF, but they are also potential impacts on fellow students and their families and the UCF you love,” she said.
