The University of Central Florida will match up with the University of Louisville’s football program once again.
UCF will play in Kentucky on September 18, 2021, and at home September 17, 2022, against the Cardinals. 
In 1985, the Cardinals led the series with a 42-21 victory when UCF played in NCAA Division II. In 2013, UCF trailed 28-7 by the second half in Kentucky but scored 24 unanswered points before Louisville scored a touchdown with 3:00 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Knights had O’Leary and Blake Bortles at the helm and slowly drove down the field until a touchdown would be made two yards from the line. The score: 38-35.
The win would be the first over a top-ten team for UCF.
