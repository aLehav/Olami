Today, around a dozen members of Campus Peace Action gathered around the Reflection Pond to protest on behalf of refugees displaced by the recent humanitarian crisis in Syria.
Auggie El√≠as, President of Campus Peace Action, stated the purpose of the rally was to raise awareness for refugees, break stereotypes about immigrants, and encourage students to sign a petition calling for the United States government to allow more Syrian refugees safe haven in this country.
