UCF bar, “The Station,” is closing for business after Saturday night.
“Tonight will be our last night in business at the University Commons plaza. We thank you for supporting us. We hope to see you one last time,” The Station tweeted out.
The Station has been facing an eviction lawsuit since March. On April 23, an order was granted that would require The Station to pay rent into the court registry, apparently while the lawsuit plays out. The court file indicates both sides may disagree over the rent and a motion was filed to determine rent. 
“The Station Bar and Grill will be closed indefinitely after tonight. It’s been an amazing year and a half curating this concept. I hope people remember us for all of the good times they had,” said Station owner Mikey Rubino. “I cannot comment on full details at this time. I will say however, that we will not be working with University Commons any longer.”
