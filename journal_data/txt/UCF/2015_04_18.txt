Numerous cancer survivors gathered with hundreds of students Saturday afternoon at UCF’s Memory Mall for this year’s Relay for Life to help raise money to end the fight against cancer.

Cancer survivors took the first lap around Memory Mall and then asked the public to join them as they continued.
Relay for Life UCF kicked off at 2 p.m. and will continue until 8 a.m. Sunday morning.
Several student organizations had tents set up along the inside edge of Memory Mall and were selling food and merchandise as well as taking donations, all of which would go toward helping end the fight against cancer.
