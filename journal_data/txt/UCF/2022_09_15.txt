The Knights will rock their ice white Jersey tops with the grey Pegasus logo  on the sleeve with gold pants. The team will wear a white helmet with a shiny gold UCF logo on the left side of the helmet and a gold cursive Knights on the right side of the helmet. 
Even though the knights aren’t home this week you can still root on your team for a rebound victory with other members of Knight Nation that will sure to be a good time at any of the locations above. Go Knight, Charge On!
