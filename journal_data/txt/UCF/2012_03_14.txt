Universal Knights is one of the most popular events for students at UCF, and KnightNews.com has checked with SGA and found out important information those who want to participate need to know.
CONTESTS:  SIGN UP TO WIN THE NEW IPAD – ONE OF OUR LUCKY READERS WILL!
Universal Knights 2012 is scheduled to take place on April 15, 2012. SGA will be distributing tickets from April 2 – April 5 from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. in the Student Union.
 Each night, the Student Union will be transformed into an area of the theme park said SGA Public Relations Coordinator, Ashley Tinstman.
Monday, April 2 – Wizarding Knight (8 p.m. – 11 p.m.)
Tuesday, April 3 – Seuss Knight (8 p.m. – 11 p.m.)
Wednesday, April 4 – Jurassic Knight (8 p.m. – 11 p.m.)
Thursday, April 5 – Toon at Noon (*This is our only distribution time during the day. It will be held from noon to 3 p.m., in order to accommodate the students who cannot come at night.)
Thursday, April 5 – Marvel Characters Knight (8 p.m. – 11 p.m.)
There will be free food, prizes and entertainment each night. Students must have a valid UCF ID to receive a ticket, and only a limited number of tickets will be distributed each night to ensure that we have enough to give out for the entire week. Students will be given a ticket, as well as a wristband, and they will need both for admission into the park.
