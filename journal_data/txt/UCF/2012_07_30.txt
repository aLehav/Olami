Approximately one year ago, Knightnews.com broke the story about UCF receiving a Letter of Inquiry from the NCAA regarding possible NCAA violations in its football and basketball program. You can read that article here.
Tomorrow, Tuesday July, 30th, UCF will learn the results of the investigation around noon. UCF President John C. Hitt has not commented on the situation since he initially did when UCF learned of the investigations saying that, “We will cooperate fully with the NCAA. If we have done something wrong, we will deal with it in a manner that is consistent with our responsibilities as a member of the NCAA and our own high standards of conduct.”
UCF performed an investigation of their own, where self-imposed penalties caused them to vacate wins in basketball, reduced the number of recruiters allowed in football, and reduced financial aid rewards for men’s basketball.
Since the infractions, UCF athletic Director Keith Tribble resigned.
Knightnews.com will update you with all of the penalties as soon as they are announced tomorrow.
