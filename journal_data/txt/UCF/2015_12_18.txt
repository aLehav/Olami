Basketball never stops for the Knights, not even on winter break. 
The UCF Knights men’s basketball team (5-3) is hitting the road for the first time since Thanksgiving break to take on the Detroit Titans (5-3) Saturday. Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m. on ESPN3.
The Knights are coming off a 75-61 win over FAU and are now on a four game win streak. UCF is ahead in the all-time series against Detroit holding a 1-0 advantage. The teams last met on December 17, 2014, at the CFE Arena, where the Knights won 75-70.
The Black & Gold’s offense has relied on scoring-by-committee with A.J. Davis (12.0), Adonys Henriquez (11.6) and Shaheed Davis (10.4) averaging double-digit points. Freshman Tacko Fall sits just under the 10-point mark at 9.4 points per game.
Defense has also been a strong point for the Knights, holding its opponents to just 36.6 percent from the field, which ranks 13th in the NCAA. The Knights currently rank sixth nationally in rebounds per game (44.88) and 15th in blocks per game (6.1).
Redshirt sophomore AJ Davis is coming off a hot game against FAU where he scored 23 points and added 15 rebounds. 7-foot-6 Tacko Fall was responsible for six of the team’s eight blocks. 
The Knights are scheduled to play again at the CFE Arena on December 22 at 7 p.m. against Bethune Cookman (4-6).
