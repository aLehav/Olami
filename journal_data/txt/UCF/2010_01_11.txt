That’s right America, the season premiere of American Idol is Tuesday night, and who better to bring you the experience than KnightNews.com?
KnightNews.com is co-hosting the American Idol launch party with FOX, and it’s all taking place on the UCF campus at Brooklyn Pizza from 7 p.m. until 10 p.m.
Remember back in July when we showed you video of UCF students auditioning for the show in downtown Orlando at the Amway Arena? Well, tonight’s the night to see if any fellow UCF Knights made the cut!
The show will be broadcast on an enormous projection screen in the restaurant, and those in attendance can eat while watching the premiere –don’t forget to take advantage of Brooklyn Pizza’s special, $5 for 2 slices of pizza and a drink.
And if you didn’t get picked in July to make it on Idol, you will have a chance to be broadcast on national television as the actual episode of American Idol will show live shots from these launch parties all over the nation.
KnightNews.com will be giving out free shirts and American Idol prizes for those in attendance, so make sure you get there early before supplies run out.

UPDATE:
According to multiple sources, the two female victims of this robbery are not UCF students. They attend Valencia Community College.
KnightNews.com reached one of the Valencia students living at the home by phone yesterday. In that interview, she said she was packing up to move out.
She also said she didn’t know why deputies initially told news agencies they were UCF students, because everyone who lived there goes to Valencia. UCF also confirmed the victims are not UCF students.

Two female UCF students were reportedly violently robbed at gunpoint and bound with duct tape during a terrifying home invasion overnight.
According to reports, Orange County sheriff’s deputies said one robber tricked the women into opening their door, after knocking on it and claiming he hit one of their cars. Then, that man and three others — armed with guns — rushed in the apartment, forced the women to the floor, and tied them up with tape while robbing them.
The robbery happened before midnight at the Sun Key apartments, located near Goldenrod Road and University Blvd.The robbers got away with a flat screen TV, cell phones and money.
The two UCF students were apparently randomly targeted by the robbers, deputies said.
Despite deputies bringing out dogs to hunt down the suspects, they somehow got away and are still on the loose right now.
Both women were not injured, but of course were shaken up.
One of the suspects is described as a 6 foot tall white male, wearing a black and white striped jacket. Another was reportedly a 5 foot 9 black male with a goatee, two silver chains, one with a cross and skull.
