Paul Ferraro has been hired as the new defensive coordinator for UCF, according to FootballScoop.com and the Orlando Sentinel.
Ferraro replaces Jim Fleming, who took the head coaching job at Rhode Island last week. O’Leary has previous experience working with Ferraro, as he was the defensive backs coach under O’Leary during his tenure at Georgia Tech in 1999-2000.
Paul Ferraro started as a graduate assistant in 1982 at UMass and has since had stretches working as the special teams coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings and was a linebackers coach for the St.Louis Rams for three seasons.
The Orlando Sentinel reports that a source tells them Ferraro will not coach at the Fiesta Bowl, but will be in attendance.
