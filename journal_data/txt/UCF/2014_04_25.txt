UPDATE Chi Omega will remain on interim suspension following its meeting with UCF Friday. 
KnightNews.com has learned the names of the suspects in the Chi Omega hazing investigation.
The suspects police were investigating were Marae Genie Watkins-Creel, Lauren Nicole Hartwell and Maribeth Ann Snyder, according to an official UCF source. 
KnightNews.com has confirmed that at least one victim reportedly was so drunk she could not stand after trying to walk home from the incident. That’s when the boyfriend was called for assistance. 
One victim reported blacking out and was unable to remember a portion of the night. That victim also reported suffering bruising from being carried while she was passed out. She also reported vomiting.  
Chi Omega was scheduled to have a student conduct hearing on Friday to decide whether their interim suspension should stay in effect until their formal full hearing. 
KnightNews.com is continuing to gather new information and will update this breaking news as we learn more.
