Incoming freshmen attended Opening Knight to learn about the multiple social and academic registered student organizations available at the University of Central Florida. 
Out of the 624 RSOs at UCF, 130 of them attended Opening Knight to recruit new members with mainly freshmen in attendance. 
While students socialized and explored new opportunities, they also enjoyed free Dominos pizza and Smoothie King smoothies. 
“The stereotype is that upperclassmen don’t really like freshmen, but that doesn’t seem to be the case here,” says freshman Daniel Hureira who expressed his experiences with friendly UCF students who were willing to lend a helping hand.

“I get to see all the clubs that are out here and I also get to like meet new people as well,” freshman Zachary Jackson said. “So it’s just the best of both worlds.”
Dancing in the crowd of students in the Pegasus Ballroom were Carlos Hernandez and Virginia Vasquez of Latin Rhythm. The duo drew a small crowd which led to increased interest in this dance club. 
“Our main goal is to spread the love of dance,” head instructor Hernandez said. He added that the college experience is only as much as one makes it and urges students to get involved. 
Glee Club president Ethan Hooper said his advice for incoming freshmen is: “Don’t be scared, you know, go out there and make new friends and try new things. UCF has a lot to offer. it’s big and all but everyone is really inviting and you just have to make that step forward to become part of something bigger.”
