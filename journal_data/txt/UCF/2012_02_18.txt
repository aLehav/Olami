Update: After this story was published, the Greek Week chair posted on KnightNews.com’s Facebook page stating OFSL staff had the final say in selecting the pairings — not the student committee, as UCF had told KnightNews.com in our original story below. We are working to find out the source of this conflicting information and will be updating the story with more information soon. 
Knightnews.com inquired the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life about how the selection process happened. After multiple e-mails and phone calls asking who picked the Greek Week partners, strangely, none were answered.
We resorted to asking the UCF spokesperson who gave a brief response explaining that the Greek Week committee picks the partners. The Greek Week committee, according to the UCF spokesman, consists of students who pick the partners based on size and partnerships in previous years, to prevent repeats of pairings.
However, what is still unclear is how the chapters who are eligible to be paired up get picked.
It is also interesting to note that several years ago, Knightnews.com confirmed that Greek Week pairings used to be a public event. The eligible organizations were picked out of a hat, so no one on the Greek Week committee had any possibility of an unfair advantage in picking their fraternity or sorority partners.
It appears that Greek Week is not interested in being interviewed directly to explain the process, and since it was done behind closed doors, it will remain a secret now.
Knightnews.com is not making any accusations, but will look into the issue more.
