Check out the video highlights of Old Dominion vs UCF, with Dwight McCombs and P.J. Gaynor Slam Dunks:




The man responsible for catching suspected sorority burglars sneaking into the Kappa Alpha Theta house was honored by UCF police Chief Richard Beary during a ceremony Monday afternoon. 
Beary thanked Waste Management driver Richard J. Nacewicz, who was in “the right place at the right time,” for calling UCF police and helping them arrest the Sigma Phi Epsilon alumni when he noticed them sneaking into the house, according to a UCF police release. 
KnightNews.com broke the sorority burglary story last week, including how the house was familiar territory to the suspects, as they both belonged to SigEp before the fraternity lost its house — and charter — following a hazing scandal that erupted in 2007.  The Theta sorority eventually took over the former SigEp house. 
This isn’t the first time a Waste Management worker has helped police. The company started a program for drivers early this year, instructing them to call police if they see a crime or suspicious people where they don’t belong, according to the UCFPD release. 
The man responsible for catching the suspected sorority burglars in the act has been honored by his company before. He’s wears a “Top Gun” badge on his uniform, after being named driver of the year in 2010. 
The suspects never responded to KnightNews.com’s texts requesting comment, seeing if they’d tell their side of the story.
