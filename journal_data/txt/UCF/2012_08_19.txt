Several news outlets, including the Orlando Sentinel, are reporting that Marcus Jordan will not be playing basketball for the University of Central Florida, however, will continue to take classes at the school.
News comes shortly after UCF’s star forward Keith Clanton announced that he would, in fact, be returning to the basketball program for his senior year.
“I think to people’s surprise I will be returning to UCF for my Sr. season I love this team and my dreams and goals can be fulfilled here,” Clanton said via Twitter.
Jordan’s decision to remove himself from the basketball program comes a few weeks after the NCAA hit UCF with several penalties including a one year post-season ban in response to shady recruitment tactics.
This news does leave room for Jordan to transfer to another school, however it seems likely he will finish his senior year within the limits of the classroom.
