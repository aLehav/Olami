The Knights (25-16, 12-3) asserted themselves as American Athletic Conference baseball favorites this past weekend, taking two out of three against No. 10 Louisville.
UCF beat Louisville (28-11, 8-4) both times in a double-header on Thursday night, but lost to the Cardinals 3-2 on Friday night. The two wins against a top 10 ranked program in the nation could also give the Knights a chance to crack the top 25 poll themselves.
The Knights were very close to sweeping the Cardinals, loading the bases in the ninth inning but were unable to bring the tying runner in with two outs.
“The message to the guys after the game was that although they are disappointed with tonight, they should be very proud of the way they played this weekend,” head coach Terry Rooney said after the game. “Every weekend you try and win the series and they won the series against a top-10 Louisville team. They battled all the way to the very last pitch.”
UCF will get a rest this week to focus on final exams, but will have another weekend AAC series against Rutgers starting on Friday.
