This past Saturday, July 28th, Home of the Sole held their first event at the Blue Moon Ultra Lounge in Waterford.
Hundreds of  sneaker enthusiasts came out to the event, to buy, sell, and check out all the shoes. We caught up with two of the founders, Mike Irene and Mike Perez, along with a few people who came to the event.

ESPN reports that UCF will receive a one-year football bowl ban along with a one-year basketball tournament ban for recruiting violations.
Earlier Tuesday morning, the NCAA held a teleconference where they released the punishments that they would be imposing on UCF. For a Knights fan looking to see UCF end their last season in C-USA as champions, that may not be the case. Conference USA told ESPN that the Knights would be banned from playing in the C-USA tournament and C-USA championship games.
This comes after UCF were named as the favorites to win the Conference USA East Division in a recent media poll.
However, George O’Leary convinced President John Hitt to appeal the bans on Tuesday. The appeal should hold off the sanctions during the appeal process, meaning that UCF should be eligible to compete for a bowl in 2012-2013. If the appeal process finds that UCF is still deserving of the penalties, then they will face bowl suspension in 2013-2014.
Other penalties UCF received are listed below:
•One finding of unethical conduct for former assistant football coach David Kelly.
•One finding of failure to monitor compliance for men’s basketball coach Donnie Jones.
•A five year probation that will run through the 2017 season.
•Self-imposed limits on scholarships
•A 50,000 dollar penalty
•Self-imposed vacating on men’s basketball victories from 2008 to 2011
•Coach Donnie Jones three games suspension starting season.
•Reduction in football coaches who can recruit off campus from seven to five and for men’s basketball at any one time from three to two.
