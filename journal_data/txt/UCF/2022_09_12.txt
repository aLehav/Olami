A man has been sentenced to 90 days in jail after recording nude women in bathrooms where police found 37 videos of 18 different females on his phone according to officials. 
Alachua County Circuit Judge James M. Colaw sentenced Deontre Mason of Carterville Illinois to one year of house arrest and four years of probation after pleading no contest to nine counts of video voyeurism felony charges. 
Although being sentenced to 90 days in jail, Judge Colaw credited Mason for 81 days already served from time spent in jail. 
Mason, who is not a student at the University of Florida or University of Central Florida, has also been ordered to not have any contact with his victims and to stay away from all universities and colleges. 
Mason will also be required to undergo a mental health evaluation within 30 days of release and to give up any sexual photos and videos he may still possess within seven days of release according to court reports. 
The charges come after a similar voyeurism case on Nov. 29 on 2021 where Mason was reported by a girl in a bathroom at UCF was on the toilet when she noticed a phone hovering over the stall divider recording her University of Central Florida police say.
