UCF Athletics announced it anticipates full capacity at its home football games and other home athletics events this fall.
The university recently announced its plan to return largely to a pre-COVID environment and said full participation will be allowed at UCF athletic and social events at the start of the Summer B term.
UCF Director of Athletics Terry Mohajir said he believes everyone hoped for a full return this fall, and the announcement represents a vote of confidence and a notable step in that direction.
“The combination of vaccination success stories and the low number of COVID cases on campus played into the decision to move to this position,” Mohajir said. “As we open our fall seasons, vaccines will be a critical way we can prioritize the health and safety of Knight Nation and help ensure our fans are comfortable attending our games.”
The decision for UCF to update its attendance policy comes from the guidance of the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the state’s 12 public universities. 
Per UCF’s updated mask policy, fans will not be required to wear masks at the games or any social events this fall. UCF Athletics said fans may still choose to wear face coverings. 
UCF has sold 93% of its season-ticket allotment for the 2021 home football season, something Mohajir said he has been excited to see in an effort to pack the Bounce House this fall.
“As far as football is concerned, we’ve already experienced strong momentum in recruiting and fan engagement with Coach [Gus] Malzahn and his staff,” Mohajir said. “We look forward to joining our alumni and fans in experiencing our 2021 football season in a packed and rocking Bounce House.”
Knight fans can call 407-823-1000 for more information on the games and buy tickets.
