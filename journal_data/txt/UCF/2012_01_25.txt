A cyber stalking scandal which took place here at UCF has developed into national news.
Patrick Macchione,24, was sentenced to 4 years in prison with 15 years of probation pleading no contest  on 19 charges of cyberstalking, according to ABC news. The network reported Macchione stalked fellow UCF student Kristen Pratt for over a year before he was arrested.

Macchione was accused of sending death threats via the popular social networking site Twitter, and over 27 threatening videos over Youtube.
The two met when they were  students at UCF  in 2009, Pratt claims the relationship was normal at first, but took a turn for the worse shortly after. According to Pratt, the relationship got weird once Macchione started leaving hundreds of voicemails and text messages routinely.
Pratt is still not completely satisfied claiming that 15 years of probation is not enough, and he is not completely locked down with just an ankle bracelet on.
 



The founder of now shutdown file-sharing site Megaupload suffered another setback after being arrested over copyright infringement claims — he also lost his top ranking in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.

That’s according Yahoo, which reports Kim Dotcom (Kim Schmitz) earned the Call of Duty “crown” on New Year’s Eve, with the name MEGARACER, only to see it slip away when he was later locked up and unable to play. 
He was arrested in his New Zealand mansion when Megaupload was shutdown, around the same time the SOPA controversy hit a high in the United States, Yahoo reports. Several lawmakers have dropped support of the controversial legislation in the wake of protests from Google, Wikipedia, Reddit and others. 
If you’re wondering who took his place in the Call of Duty rankings, it’s someone by the name Azaros.
