NFL rookie and former UCF defensive back Mike Hughes fulfilled a lifelong promise he made: to buy his mother a house.
The ‚Äòdream come true‚Äô for Hughes was posted on social media over the weekend and includes a picture of his family in front of the house.
 Worked my whole life to accomplish this moment. Being able to get my mother the house she wanted by doing what I love is nothing short of a dream come true! Love you mama ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hughes may not see as much action on defense as he did with the Knights in his first year, however, we are sure to see the standout on kick return given stellar performances in the 2017¬†season: two returned kick-offs, a punt and interception for touchdown, and¬†four total interceptions, including the game-winning touchdown at home versus USF to send UCF to the AAC Championship.
Vikings jerseys for Hughes are already on sale.
Prayed for times like this!! #21
