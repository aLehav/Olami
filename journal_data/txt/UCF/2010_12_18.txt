The power went out on the Miami Hurricanes basketball team in the second half against UCF — literally.
After leading by 10 points at the half, Miami took control of the game against the Knights, but a 12-4 run and a jolt of energy charged the Knights to pull to within two points at 47-45, then the power went out in the arena at the Bank Atlantic Center.
The outage cost a delay that was over 25 minutes, halting the Knights run, but it was Miami who felt the outage as the Knights escaped 20 missed second-half free throws to go on to win 84-78 at the Orange Bowl Classic in Sunrise, Fla. and remain undefeated on the season.
The win was the sixth over an in-state team this season, including wins over South Florida and Florida earlier in the year.
Marcus Jordan led UCF (10-0) with a game-high 23 points, but suffered an ankle injury with 84 seconds left and didn’t return. The Knights leading scorer, Keith Clanton, scored 14 points, including 6-of-8 from the field, all but one point in the second half and grabbed seven boards for UCF. The Knights shot 75 percent from the floor in the second half.
The Knights led early in the game, but a 17-0 Miami run put the ‘Canes up 21-10. UCF missed 12 consecutive shots during the period.
UCF is off to it’s best start since 1979 and are on the verge of cracking the AP Top 25 for the first time in school history.
