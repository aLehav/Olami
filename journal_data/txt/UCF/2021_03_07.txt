UCF announced its plans to recognize students graduating in spring with two options for graduation celebrations and will celebrate its 2020 graduates at a later date. 
The Florida Board of Governors provided guidance that will allow more in-person commencements while maintaining COVID-19 protocol and social distancing guidelines, and recognition of graduates is scheduled to happen from April 3 to May 9. 
The format of these celebrations allows UCF to recognize all graduates in a manner that is in accordance with the state’s public-health guidance, UCF said. 
Grad Walk
From April 30 to May 4, UCF will allow students to walk across the stage of Addition Financial Arena in its second installment of Grad Walk, which debuted last fall — it will provide a more intimate graduation experience for the students graduating in spring 2021. 
UCF graduates will be able to pick a 15-minute time slot, walk across the stage, hear their name be called, receive their diploma and soak up the cheers of up to five guests. 
An official UCF photographer will be there to provide graduation photos, both individual and group photos, for the graduates.
“The entire Grad Walk experience will be under one hour and does not include a formal program, commencement speaker, or guests on the platform,” the release states. “If you select this option, you will be emailed a registration link after March 19 to schedule the date and time for your experience.”

In-Person Commencement
UCF’s 13 colleges will hold in-person commencements between May 5 and May 9 for those graduating in the spring. 
This is a more traditional In-Person Commencement held in Addition Financial Arena. Official regalia, ordered in advance through Herff Jones, is required to participate.
Due to COVID-19 precautions, some colleges may have multiple ceremonies in order to accommodate all students, UCF said.  
Each graduate will be allowed two guests, and they must adhere to the university’s COVID regulations and complete the COVID self-checker before entering campus.
Students can register for — and read more information about — the In-Person Commencement here.
Those who cannot attend will be able to watch the ceremony via live stream.
Once you submit the form, selections are final and plans will be made based on responses — students will not have the ability to change to a different option.
Specifics will be shared in late March for students’ selected commencement experience.
UCF said students’ diplomas will not be given out during Grad Walk or In-Person Commencement but they will mail it in 8-12 weeks after the close of the semester.
The students who graduated in 2020 will have a different ceremony.
UCF said it is excited to offer the opportunity for its 2020 graduates to return and participate in its UCF Commencement.
“By completing this form, you are expressing your interest in participating in a traditional commencement ceremony later this year, and plans will be made based on graduate response,” UCF said. “Details about this opportunity will be communicated with those who submit this form in the coming months.”
