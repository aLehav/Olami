The 9-seed University of Central Florida defeated the 8-seed Virginia Commonwealth University73-58 to make history for the program and advance in March Madness.
Senior center Tacko Fall stole the spotlight with five blocked shots, 13 points, and 18 rebounds. Fall is the first player to earn a double-double in program history.
“It means a lot to us, to me, to the fans,” Fall said. “Finally being able to pull it off after all these years has meant a great deal to us.”
VCU and UCF combined to go 1 for 20 in the game’s opening but the Knights would break away to score more than half of their first-half finish on the next ten shots. UCF held a ten-point lead 34-24 by halftime. When the second half came around, UCF scored 19 unanswered points and created a 10-minute drought for VCU – all the while, 7-6 center Tacko Fall spelled trouble for VCU’s offense and rebound game.

“I mean Tacko is 7-6,” VCU forward Isaac Vann said following the game. “Some of those shots we usually get at the rim. It’s kind of hard to get those with him down there.”
When the Knights face the Blue Devils, UCF head coach Johnny Dawkins will play against his former head coach Mike Krzyzewski as a player (1983-86) and as an assistant coach (98-08).
UCF (24-8) will play Duke (30-5) in the second round on Sunday at 5:15 p.m. at Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, South Carolina.

The Muslim Student Association hosted a vigil in honor of the victims of the massacre in New Zealand Friday afternoon in the Student Union. 
“For us the Mosque is a second home,” Abdullah Saqib, vice president of MSA said. “We grew up in the Mosque and to see such a sanctified and homey place be devastated in this manner was horrifying for us.”
The student union atrium Friday afternoon was filled with candles and the names of the victims on the UCF Pegasus, as well as about 70 people in attendance. MSA student board, UCF interim president and the UCF police chief gave condolences and words of encouragement and unity in response to the atrocity, and how the community should respond.
“I remember saying I was so grateful for the support [in response to the Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting] from the Muslim community, and I said I hope I never have the opportunity to repay you back how would that even occur?” Aaron Weil, director of Hillel center for Jewish life said. “Now here we stand as a community. The world seemingly learning nothing from these tragedies, going over this horrible repetition of senseless Islamophobia and Xenophobia that has one destination, death.”
Randah El-Gendi, sophomore MSA treasurer shared why she felt it was important to help make this event.
“We want to spread an awareness about the situation,” El-Gendi said. “We [Muslim community] want to tell people you don’t have to be Muslim to feel hurt; you don’t have to be Jewish or Hindu to feel hurt for their tragedies. Now it’s our job to honor those lives and to do better for those lives.”
Rasha Mubarak, vice president of the Muslim Women’s Organization of Orlando said this moment is a call to action to be cautious aware but not afraid.
“It’s up to us to continue this fight we need to continue unconditionally,” Mubarak said. “When a black Muslim sister in Congress is under attack and we see silence that is equivalent to violence. Islamophobia is heavily layered and all systematic oppression.”
Mubarak went on to speak about the importance of civic engagement.
“To my Muslim community, as we approach 2020 don’t let these candidates take your money, take your vote and not take your voice to Tallahassee or Washington D.C.,” Mubarak said. “Get active, get involved, because when we fight we win.”
Carl Metzger, UCF police chief spoke about the UCF response to the attack.
“Although this happened halfway around the world, the same hate has impacted us in our own backyard.” Metzger said. “It [the massacre] was heartbreaking, senseless and intended to incite violence but had the opposite effect on our amazing UCF community. We always stand together and support one another in times of darkness and it’s a blessing to see that happening again today.”



One of the University of Central Florida’s campus landmarks will “undergo a makeover” in Spring 2019 and change its name to Addition Financial Arena.
Formerly known as the UCF Arena and built in 2007, CFE Federal Credit Union earned the naming rights to the arena in 2013 and has hosted events from concerts, MMA fights, presidential watch parties and rallies, and numerous athletic events. The arena sold out in 2017 and posted its highest attendance when the UCF men’s basketball team hosted Illinois in the NIT Invitational.
CFE Federal Credit Union mailed a voting form to its members announcing a plan to change from a federal credit union to a state credit union, citing an opportunity to tailor the banking system to Florida residents and expand outside of Central Florida.
As part of the change in structure, CFE will change its name to Addition Financial.
“We are pleased to continue our partnership with the University of Central Florida and the CFE Arena as we transition our name to Addition Financial. Under our new name, we will remain dedicated to our heritage in education, and will proudly serve the university in the years to come,” says Kevin Miller, CFE’s president and CEO.
The name change for both the bank and arena will take effect on May 1. CFE will pay for the installation of signage which will begin in late March. CFE/Addition Financial will continue to be UCF’s official financial institution.
“We have a fantastic relationship with our great partners at CFE.  We are proud to now serve as a landmark as they rebrand the credit union to Addition Financial and continue to host quality events for the Central Florida community. Our partnership with CFE Federal Credit Union helps provide important and convenient resources for our students, faculty, and staff,” says Ronnie Lamkin, general manager of the UCF Convocation Corporation, which operates the CFE Arena.

A group of 21 students came to an open forum to share personal testimonies and what should be done to reduce gender inequality. The event was hosted in the Student Union Wednesday afternoon by Stefanie Campbell of the Multicultural Student Center.
Students from different backgrounds elaborated on their experiences with misogyny from cultural traditions. 
“I don’t feel like it’s considered a pressing issue,” Campbell said. “Whenever the news speaks about issues of course there are many bad things happening; but when there’s news that is focusing on issues that are shining gender inequalities, like gender mutilation or women’s marches and they [women] are not getting recognition for it.”
Many students spoke on how the media depicts gender roles as being a contributor to the mentalities people eventually evolve. A student shared how in coloring books there are specific roles for men and women. The student shared her example of always seeing women as the nurses and men as the doctors.
Michelle Kahn, 20, sophomore accounting major, shared her experience growing up with Pakistani immigrants.
“My family moved here for us,” Kahn said. “I’m the second person in my family to go to college for the first time. Though, anytime I go to a family event the question I get the most is when are you getting married?”
Kahn said her parents’ modernizing is owed solely toward their migration from Pakistan.
“If I was born there [Pakistan], I probably would have been married and popped two kids out by now,” Kahn said.
Kahn said her family has become more modern and have become more accepting of “love” marriages among her kids. Though Kahn shared, her brother had no issue with convincing her parents of who he wanted to marry, unlike her sisters trying to convince her parents.
“I would have to make sure that this [significant other] is who I want, and this is what I’d fight for.”
A student who is studying to become a vet technician shared how women dominate her field. When the clinic she works for got a new doctor who was male, she said she witnessed how uncomfortable the female staff had got initially.
Students of diverse background shared how culture played a huge role in their perception of their role at home based off their gender.
“I grew up in a very traditional Latino household,” said Ashley Perez, 22, graduate student in social work. “A lot of the personal experiences resonated with me and validated my experience that as women we might be used by gaslighting [questioning one’s judgement] and there might be more to it. But sometimes it [maltreatment or rejection] is just being pigeon-hold in [assign to a group or class in an exclusive manner] due to your gender.
A male student shared how he was discouraged from doing household chores because “it won’t be necessary” and was encouraged to focus on outdoor work. 
“Having other Latina friends, and hearing many stories echo each-others we start to question why Hispanic mothers might enable their sons, and enact misogyny onto their daughters?” Perez asked. “It’s a matter of wanting to take personal responsibility of saying this generational cycle. Saying, we’re going to raise our boys different and we’re going to raise our children all the same.”
