The holiday season is in full swing and Universal Orlando has launched its annual Orlando Holidays Celebration.
Featuring Grinchmas and Macy’s Holiday Parade, with floats directly from the New York City Macy’s Parade, the theme park is as festive as ever.

Filling up on some Chipotle this Sunday night in the UCF area will not be happening for UCF students.
KnightNews.com has confirmed that Chipotle closed its doors at 6 p.m. for a company holiday party at both the University and Waterford locations.
“I was studying for finals and went to get some Chipotle. When I got there I was devastated to realize it was closed for the night,” said UCF student Luke Davis. 
Normally open until 10 p.m., Chipotle will resume normal business hours on Monday. 



The UCF Knights (9-3, 7-1) will take on the NC State Wolfpack (7-5, 3-5 ACC) in the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl on Dec. 26 at 8 p.m.
It will be a common field for the Knights to play on, as they beat Ball State in the St. Pete Bowl in 2012 and lost to Rutgers in the bowl in 2009. The bowl is played annually at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla.
UCF’s match-up, the ACC’s North Carolina State Wolfpack, have shown signs of promise this season, but have five losses on the season to Florida State, Clemson, Boston College, Louisville and Georgia Tech.
UCF beat NC State on the road in 2007, but the Wolfpack came to Orlando in 2010 and beat the Knights.
