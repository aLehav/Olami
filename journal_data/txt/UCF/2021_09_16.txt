UCF was proud to host its first Latinx Film Festival on Thursday, September 16.
Organized by several groups including the Department of English, School of Politics, UCF Global, and Puerto Rico Research Hub, this hybridized Zoom/in-person event celebrates Latinx Heritage Month and Latinx filmmaking. 
Films are presented in the Visual Arts Building to “showcase the experience of the Latinx community.” The curation explores socioeconomic, racial, and cultural topics.
The inaugural screening was “Guie’dani’s Navel” and attracted dozens of guests from students, faculty, staff to event-goers from the Orlando area. 
Nicholson School of Communication & Media student Natalie Klinkenberg felt proud to attend.
“I’m Mexican myself,” she said. “It’s really nice to see movies from people who are just like me.”
The free screenings will continue to be held on Thursdays. Reservation is required.
