CJ Kelly led the Knights in points again, but UCF fell to Oregon in the second round of the NIT on Sunday night. 
The sophomore Nate Bittle led the Oregon Ducks to the 68-54 win over UCF. Bittle sank 7 of 14 shots from the floor with a 3-pointer for the Ducks. UCF shot inefficiently hitting just 4 off 17 from the 3-point range before intermission. 
The Oregon Ducks advanced to play Wisconsin who won and will go on to play North Texas on Tuesday March 28th.
