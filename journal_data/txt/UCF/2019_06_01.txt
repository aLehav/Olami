President Trump announced plans Friday to launch his 2020 re-election campaign at the Amway Center on June 18 at 8 p.m., according to a tweet by the President.
“I will be announcing my second term presidential run with First Lady Melania, Vice President Mike Pence, and Second Lady Karen Pence on June 18th in Orlando, Florida, at the 20,000 seat Amway Center,” the president declared on Twitter.“Join us for this historic rally!”
The selection of Orlando emphasizes the importance of winning Florida in the upcoming 2020 presidential election – a state in which Trump narrowly won over then Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with a margin of 1.2% in 2016, according to Politico.
A counter-event to the Trump rally quickly began making rounds on social media Friday after his announcement. Shortly after the announcement, an event page titled “Resist Hate Rally Orlando” surfaced on Facebook. Hosted by Brandon Wolf, a Pulse-survivor and activist, the counter-rally will aim to “welcome him [President Trump] in the way we know best: by telling him that hate has no place here,” the Facebook page explains.
The Resist Hate Rally is scheduled from 5-7:30 p.m., a location has yet to be announced.
Tickets to President Trump’s 2020 campaign launch are available here for free.
