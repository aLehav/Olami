The University of South Florida is asking students to refrain from taking “selfies” when receiving their diplomas at graduation ceremonies in the coming weeks.
A school official told the Tampa Bay Tribune that taking “selfies” on stage would slow the commencement down. 
“We want students to think about the dignity of the ceremony,” Michael A. Freeman, USF assistant vice president and dean for students told the Tampa Bay Business Journal. “It’s supposed to be exciting, but it’s a serious academic ceremony.”
UCF officials have not found a reason to ban the ever-increasingly popular picture.
“Our graduates conduct themselves in a professional manner, and this hasn’t been an issue for us,” UCF Spokesman Chad Binette told the Orlando Sentinel. 
However, UCF does ask graduates to keep their cell phones, video cameras and other electronic devices turned off during the ceremony. UCF graduations start on May 1. 



The UCF quarterback race just heated up a little bit more.
Former Dr. Phillips QB Nick Patti, a transfer from Boise State, has been granted a waiver to play for the Knights immediately, according to his Twitter.
“Cleared to play this year.. God is always good!!!,” Patti tweeted on Thursday.
Patti will enroll at UCF during Summer A. He will look to compete against Justin Holman, Pete DiNovo and Tyler Harris for the starting job.
George O’Leary has not named a starter yet, although he says his rotation going into the summer is Holman, DiNovo and Harris. As a redshirt freshman this past season, Patti played sparingly completing 8 of 11 passes for 63 yards and no touchdowns.
