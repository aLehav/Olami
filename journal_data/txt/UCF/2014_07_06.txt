People on campus using the ‘UCF Guest’ Wi-Fi network will soon have to register to access the internet.
Beginning on August 5, new technology will be implemented at UCF to require the submission of a person’s name, email address and phone number on a portal page prior to gaining access to the network.
Once that is complete, a validation code will be sent to the requester in the form of an email and SMS text. Once that code is entered, the requester will be able to access UCF Wi-Fi as a guest for up to 12 hours.
The project will kick into full gear in mid-July, with the configuration process finishing up on July 14. The product implementation is scheduled to be finished by July 18 and the soft launch on July 31. The full production launch is scheduled for August 5, when people will start registering to use the guest network.
UCF is encouraging students and faculty to use the ‘UCF_WPA2’ network. Click here for information on how to set up the student and faculty network.
 



Students looking to find some stand-up comedy on a summer night do not even have to leave campus.
On Monday, UCF student-comedian Ryan O’Toole is hosting a special summer comedy show in Wackadoos in the Student Union. O’Toole previously won Last Knight Standing, Campus Activity Board’s comedy competition held this past March.
The event, which is open to the public, will also feature Last Knight Standing comedian Sean Hyatt , as well as other comedians from the Orlando area. O’Toole is hoping to showcase some of UCF’s best comedians at the event and entry is free.
Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the show starts at 7 p.m. For more information to the event click here.
