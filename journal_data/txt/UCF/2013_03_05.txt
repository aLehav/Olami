A new document from the University of Central Florida’s Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life maps out the timeline that students can expect for reinstatement of Greek Life at the school.
The timeline states that by April 8, the end of the Spring semester, Greek organizations who have been reviewed and recognized may begin approved operating activities. The document also says that social events involving alcohol or social events that are overnight (i.e. formals away from Orlando) will not be approved for anyone this Spring semester.
Chapters will begin presenting action plans, accountability plans and Community expectation plans in two weeks. Chapters that have not been found in violation of any university policies during the past three years and have exceeded standards for the 2012 Standards of Excellence will have the first opportunities to present their plans, UCF said.
 The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life will also be hosting a series of ‘webinars’ to discuss the recent halt on Greek Life at the school as well as the plan to move forward. 
“The UCF Greek Community webinar will provide rationale to the recent decisions made at UCF, address questions and concerns and outline the process moving forward,” the OFSL site says.
The webinars will be held on Wednesday, Mar. 6, and Monday, Mar. 11, for students, staff, parents and National Headquarters and are expected to last one hour. To register for the webinar, click here.
