Just a year after Student Government was shaken up by a bribery scandal in which then-Senator William Lusk was found in major violation and removed from office (read that full story, click here) he is back as an election commissioner. 
Will Lusk is presently serving on the same commission that removed him as an elected official of SGA by disqualifying his winning election results last year. 
Knightnews.com asked President Kilbride about why he would appoint Will Lusk as an election commissioner given his history in which Kilbride responded, “Mr. Lusk was chosen to serve in this role because he has been actively involved in the elections process as a student for the past year. He has shown that he cares to make the process more transparent and fair for all students who chose to participate in student elections.”
Knightnews.com tried to reach out to Lusk for comment, but like last year, he refused to comment. 
Knightnews.com interviewed students to get their thoughts on the issue. 
Antonio Ortiz, a senior here at UCF, said, “I don’t believe he should be on the election commission because it’s pretty ironic that he was found guilty, and he’s telling other people to be ethical, when he’s not ethical himself.”
Alisa Hussain, a senior, can understand second chances but was still uncertain about Kilbride’s decision to appoint Lusk. 
“I’m the type of person that believes everyone should have a second chance, but I don’t know if I can trust him again,” she said. 
Knightnews.com is investigating this issue further.
