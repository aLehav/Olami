With the Big Ten football conference hoping to expand — and the possibility the SEC may too — it has UCF Atheltics Director Keith Tribble telling reporters the Knights must be ready this summer. 
The Orlando Sentinel reports the UCF Knights could be impacted by the big changes likely to sweep the landscape of college football. 
According to USA Today, it’s believed that the Big Ten will swell to at least 14 teams. The SEC could then react, the paper reproted, by trying to pick up several ACC schools, including possibly Florida State, Miami (Fla.), Clemson or Georgia Tech.
ACC officials are meeting this week. It’s not yet clear whether the ACC will try and expand in order to stay competitive. 
What does this mean for UCF? Could UCF end up competing against USF in the Big East? Or could we get swallowed into the ACC against Florida State and Boston College? 
“I think the volume in terms of who’s going where and what’s going to happen has been turned up very loud. And really, most of us are in a wait and see position,” Tribble told the Orlando Sentinel in an exclusive interview. “It will impact all conferences in some way depending on how the Big Ten moves.”
Tribble told the Sentinel he’d like to avoid seeing the UCF Knights football team join a different conference than the rest of the sports, but admitted UCF President John Hitt would be the main factor in that decision.
