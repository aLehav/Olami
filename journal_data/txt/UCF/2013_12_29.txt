According to AZCentral.com, UCF President Hitt and approximately 30 others traveling with UCF had their baggage accidentally left on the on the plane after arriving at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. The plane flew back to Tampa, Fla. after dropping off the UCF group and it wasn’t until Friday afternoon that the bags made it back to Phoenix.
