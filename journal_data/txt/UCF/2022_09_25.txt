On a day where UCF quarterback John Rhys Plumlee completed only eight passes, the Knights’ defense and special teams play that included four made field goals was good enough to earn a 27-10 win over Georgia Tech Saturday.

A week after having a career high 339 yards through the air in the Knights’ big rebound win over the FAU Owls, The Senior UCF QB struggled to get any offense going through the air, failing to complete a single pass in the first quarter. Plumlee finished the game going only 8 of 16 through the air for 49 yards that included an interception and a couple sacks. 
One of the lone highlights for the dual threat QB was a key 28-yard run for a touchdown nearly in the fourth quarter to help the Knights jump out to a two-score lead and effectively seal the deal for win of ACC rival Georgia Tech. With the win, UCF improves to (3-1) on the season and it marks the first time the Knights have multiple wins over the same power 5 opponent. 
Plumlee said while he plans on improving going forward in the season, he was happy to get the win no matter the circumstance. 
“A win is a win, no matter what it looks like,” said Plumlee. “I played bad out there. I think I’ve got to be better, and I will be better. What stood out today was our defense and special teams.” 
While UCF’s offense was struggling to get going, the Knights defense and special teams came up big when they needed it which included four sacks, 2 fumble recoveries and a much-needed blocked punt at the end of the first half and return for a touchdown to give the team the lead and momentum they needed going into the rest of the game.

UCF head coach Gus Malzahn said the blocked punt and return was the momentum the team needed to turn the game around and set up the win against the yellowjackets. 
“The big play of the game was the blocked punt right before halftime. It gave us some momentum,” said Malzahn. “When you go into the locker room with momentum, that’s really good in football.” 
UCF Freshman kicker Colton Boomer said the most action of his season when he went 4 for 4 for field goals which included one for 43 yards out that helped the Knights get over the finish line for its third game of the season and final game before the start of conference play.
