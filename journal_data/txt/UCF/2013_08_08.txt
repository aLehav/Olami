An endorsement from one of the world’s most well-known authors is quite the accomplishment –and that’s what one University of Central Florida grad recently got!
According to WFTV, Chris Sharek, an environmental engineer from UCF, was praised by the famous author who commented on Sharek’s book titled The Electric Vehicle rEVolution. After reviewing the book, King provided his own support for the vehicle, stating “read Chris Sharek’s lucid fact-filled book and see if you don’t agree,” WFTV reports.
 Sharek’s book summarizes his experience driving driving a Chevrolet Volt — the same car King drives himself, according to the news outlet. At a dedication ceremony for a public charging station in Downtown Sarasota, Sharek was able to meet King and recceive an autograph, the news outlet reports. 
“When I humbly asked him to autograph a novel for me, Mr. King gladly signed it ‘From one Volt owner to another,’” Sharek told WFTV.
