With the first week of the Spring semester over, the UCF Police Department is reminding students of ways to stay safe in the community. 
“I wanted to remind you that keeping you and our community safe is always top of mind for UCF Police and the UCF Office of Emergency Management. We want it to be your priority, too,” UCFPD Chief Richard Beary said in a letter to students.
UCFPD offers a variety of opportunities to learn how to stay safe and be prepared in the event of an emergency.
Starting this spring, the active shooter preparedness course “Shots Fired on Campus: When Lightning Strikes,” will be offered online for students and faculty and staff members. Previously, this class was only offered in-person.
The free course can be found here.
In March, UCF Police, Emergency Management, other campus departments and external agencies will collaborate on a regional full-scale emergency training exercise to help participants prepare for the worst-case scenario and allow them to practice new techniques that can help save lives in a crisis.
“Please remember to make your well-being and the safety of others a priority, and best wishes for a safe and successful semester,” Beary said.
