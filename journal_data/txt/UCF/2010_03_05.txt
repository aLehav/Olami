Alpha Xi Delta hosted its annual Xi Man competition on Thursday. Themed like the video game “Call of Duty,” different fraternity members competed to be Alpha Xi’s next man of the house, so to speak.
Sean Fletcher from Theta Chi came in first place overall in the competition, which was sponsored by KnightNews.com and its video production team.
Here is our exclusive interview with the new Xi Man after he won. Below that, you will also find videos of all the acts from the night in their entirety.
