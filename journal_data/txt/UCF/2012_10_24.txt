The Interfraternity Council has voted to remove tent rush immediately and fraternities will start recruiting based solely off their own events starting in Spring 2013.
Last Spring, IFC voted to remove tent rush from Memory Mall to Lake Claire with the on-campus fraternities recruiting out of their houses, a system IFC used in Spring 2010 and previous rushes.
Instead of a rush week, fraternities will recruit during a multiple week period holding events similar to the days before tent rush such as BBQ’s and meet ‘n’ greets. As always, alcohol will still be prohibited to recruit potential new members.
IFC President Mike Irene stood strong by the decision to move away from tent rush, “After much discussion with fraternity delegates, leaders, and presidents we have decided that removing the tents from rush would be best for every chapter.”
Some were skeptical when it came to moving away from tent rush, thinking that it would take away from the unique tradition UCF has with tent rush.
“Those that think tents were a tradition don’t know the background story of how the tents came to be. Financially, the money will be better allocated to our new recruitment/public relations strategy and back to the fraternities.” Irene said.
Following the rushing period, the first official day for fraternities to start their pledging process is on January 28th, 2013.
