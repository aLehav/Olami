On August 12th, members of the Interfraternity Council(IFC) made their third annual service trip, this time to New Orleans to help out two families who were devasted by Hurricane Katrina nearly 7 years ago.
The IFC, which is home to 18 different and diverse fraternities on campus, had a representative of almost every fraternity in New Orleans. In total there were more than 40 members in New Orleans to devote their time and serviceto  the victims of the devastating hurricane.
The trip to New Orleans started off with a leadership conference that was attended by all of the IFC  representatives. Following that, they got to work putting in over 16 hours of service in two days.
When they weren’t working, speakers from local New Orleans Universities gave presentations that highlighted how Greek leadership has grown and improved. IFC President Mike Irene, was more than satisfied with the event saying that, “The IFC Leadership Summit was a complete success for the third year in a row. It is always refreshing to see the entire IFC community come together to partake in community service and make this world a better place.” Irene went on to say, “The inter-fraternal bonds that were built in a few days between different IFC chapters are priceless, and we always look forward to bringing that comradery back.”
For first-timers to this event, it made a lasting impression. Fraternity member Greg Cullen said that, “It was an eye-opening experience to work together with people from different fraternities because you are so used to being with your own fraternity, it was a great collaboratioin of everyone involved. It was defnitely a memorable experience and I made great friends with members of other fraternities as well.”
With the success of this past IFC Service trip, the IFC is looking to cross state borders once-again next year as they are already in the planning stages of their fourth service trip.
