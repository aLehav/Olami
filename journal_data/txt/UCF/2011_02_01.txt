EARLIER POST: Here’s what’s to come for Knightnews.com’s coverage of National Signing Day tomorrow:
Here’s a list of top prospects to keep an eye on to see if they sign their letter of intent to play for UCF:
DaMarcus Smith – (UPDATE 12:12 P.M.: @jdemling Again, nothing firm but hearing DaMarcus Smith to Central Florida from multiple sources. #NSD) Dual-threat quarterback from Louisville Seneca high school in Kentucky. He’s a four-star prospect that’s rated the No. 11 quarterback prospect in the nation. He’s already verbally committed to Louisville, but the Cardinals are very well off at the quarterback position. UCF needs depth at quarterback, having just Jeff Godfrey and Blake Bortles behind center. Smith would provide that as well as an electrifying playmaking ability.
Leilon Willingham – An OLB out of Colorado, Willingham visited UCF this past weekend with teammate Rayson Williams, who ended up committing to UCF. The four-star prospect will make his decision at 9:30 a.m. EST and he could have an immediate impact with the Knights next season.
Lamar Dawson (UPDATE 9:30 A.M.: DAWSON COMMITTED TO SOUTHERN CAL)- The LB and Kentucky native has narrowed his choices to UCF, Kentucky, Tennessee, Oregon and USC. He is the No. 45 prospect in the country and is a big and physical linebacker at 6-2, 230. He’s rated the No. 3 player at his position and No. 1 player in the state of Kentucky. Naturally, Kentucky is said to be the favorite to land Dawson’s services.
