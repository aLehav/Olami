The 2021-22 non-conference schedule for the UCF men’s basketball team is now set in place after it was publicly released Monday.
UCF’s non-conference schedule totals up to 11 games — five of them being against Power Five opponents.   
The Knights will host Oklahoma on Nov. 27.  This will be only the second meeting between the two programs after 2020’s game was canceled due to COVID-19.
UCF gets the opportunity to host another premier program, as the Knights host Michigan on Dec. 30.   Last year’s contest was controlled by the Wolverines, as they commandingly defeated the Knights by a score of 80-58.
As for the notable road games, UCF will travel to the Miami (FL) to take on the Hurricanes on Nov. 13.
On Dec. 1, the Knights will visit Auburn, who they defeated last season by a score of 63-55.
The Knights will also take a visit to Sunrise, FL to take on Florida State — who they upset 86-74 in Tallahassee last season — in the Orange Bowl Classic on Dec. 18.  
UCF’s non-conference slate will begin on Nov. 10, with the Knights hosting Robert Morris in the Addition Financial Arena.
