The Knights are left the American Athletic conference Sunday, the same way they entered it, as Champions. UCF Fifth Year Senior Kristen Scott scored the only goal in the 45 of play after Redshirt Senior Dayana Matin broke past midfield and found Scott in the 17th minute of play as the Knights went up 1-0 over the cougars. 
KNIGHTS WWWWWWIN!!! THAT'S SIX STRAIGHT WINS AND WE REMAIN UNBEATEN IN AAC PLAY!#ChargeOn pic.twitter.com/5PHRmCjq3x
The lead would prove to be enough as the Senior-led backline did not allow a single shot on goal in the second 45 of play where the Knights haven’t allowed a goal in a home match since their Ole Miss matchup on Sept. 4. 
With the goal Scott now has nine goals for the season and has scored six goals and added three assists since returning to the team against Temple earlier this month. 
UCF Head Coach Tiffany Roberts Sahaydak said you was proud to see her team close out their final year in the AAC with another conference win. 
“It’s really just a team effort, I think we’re very balanced, the whole team is just amazing,” Sahaydak said. 
With the Win, it marks the fourth AAC title under Sahaydak’s tenure, having won the conference title in the team’s first year in the American in 2013, and then added three more championships in 2014, 2017 and now in 2022.  
The Knights still will take on rival USF in the final war on I-4 matchup before leaving for the Big 12 on Thursday at 7 p.m.  
Next the Knights will host the Conference Semifinals and Finals on Nov. 3 and Nov. 6 at the UCF Soccer Complex.
