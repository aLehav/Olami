A battle to the death… or end scene.

Over the weekend UCF students and others gathered at the Visual Arts building for the fourth annual Tourist Trap Stage Combat Workshop.
Instructors from across the country who specialize in stage combat choreography were brought in to teach students how to hone their skills on stage or screen.
The Tourist Trap is the only workshop in the state of Florida sanctioned by the Society of American Fight Directors. The workshop takes place every February at UCF.
Students interested in film or acting can look to sign up for next year’s workshop at touristtrapscw.com.
