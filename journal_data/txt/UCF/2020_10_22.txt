UCF said it plans to offer more to face-to-face classes this spring, and in a Thursday update, the university announced its plans to resume in-person activities. 
Maribeth Ehasz, vice president for Student Development and Enrollment Services, said in a Thursday statement that the on-campus experience and connection with others is important for student success.
“… in addition to more face-to-face classes, we will be working with student leaders, registered student organizations, and university staff on how we can offer more in-person activities in the spring,” Ehasz said. 
Knight News first broke the news of UCF’s plans to offer more face-to-face classes on Friday.
“Just as it has this fall, our spring on-campus experience will depend on everyone’s compliance with the COVID-19 precautions necessary to protect community health,” she said. 
Ehasz said spring class registration is set to open on Nov. 2, and individuals should keep in mind that the way courses may be taught might change.
“We know the importance of class modalities in guiding your decisions, and you will be able to view the modality for each class on myUCF at that time, although we anticipate that the modalities for some classes may change,” she said.
Ehasz said the university will also will move to entirely remote instruction following spring break, with residence halls and campus offices remaining open. 
Ehasz said this is similar to what UCF is doing this fall after Thanksgiving break. 
Ehasz said that students should work with academic advisors and utilize technologies like Pegasus Path to select the right courses and stay on track for graduation.
