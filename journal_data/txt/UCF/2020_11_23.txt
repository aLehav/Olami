Insomniac Events has announced next year’s return of Electric Daisy Carnival Orlando, and presale tickets will be available Friday. 
“2021 will mark EDC’s 10th year in Orlando, and I’m so grateful for the tremendous support we’ve received from the city of Orlando and the state of Florida,”  said Pasquale Rotella, Insomniac’s Founder and CEO. “It’s allowed us to grow the event in ways I never thought possible.”
The festival will take over Tinker Field for three nights — Nov. 12 – Nov. 14, 2021 — but Future Owl presale begins Friday at 12 p.m. at EDC’s website. 
Attendees can also take advantage of the payment plan for all ticket types with a deposit of $10.
“It’s been a dream come true to be able to make EDC a destination in Orlando where they have the best amusement parks in the world,” Rotella said. “There’s so much the city has to offer before, during, and after the festival that it’s truly an amazing experience.”
EDC Orlando was postponed this year due to safety precautions and the coronavirus, its website states. “Though the world is moving in a more positive direction, it is still too early for us to gather at EDC Orlando in 2020.”
All EDC tickets from the 2020 event will be honored for the 2021 event.
