Red Bull’s Paper Wings qualifier event is coming to UCF on February 25 at 12 p.m. inside the UCF Engineering Building. The event will be hosted by UCF’s co-ed Professional Engineering Fraternity Theta Tau UCF.
Red Bull Paper Wing’s event which has been going on since 2006, will hold a    qualifying event this Friday from 12-3 p.m. where guests will be able to compete in distance and airtime competitions. Each participant will be given two tries per competition to record their longest throw and longest time their paper airplane is in the air. Airplanes must be constructed with paper provided at the event to be considered.
Winners for both competitions will be sent to a national qualifier in the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville Alabama on April 16, which will be covered and paid for by Red Bull.
There will be a Tik Tok-related competition for students and guests attending the event where participants must record a max. 30-second video of a paper airplane performance and upload it to TikTok with:– The tag of @redbull– Their country of residence as a tag (e.g. #UnitedStates)– The hashtag #REDBULLPAPERWINGS
The one top-judged video will determine the winner, who will attend the World Final. The winner will be flown out to Red Bull headquarters in Austria with expenses covered by Red Bull.
A token will be given to students and attendees of the event for a complimentary Red Bull drink valid on the day of the event at the official after-party located at the sports bar, “Bounce House” located at 12100 Challenger Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32826.
