Two UCF football players are suspended after failing NCAA drug tests, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 
Sophomore receiver Tristan Payton and freshman cornerback Nevelle Clark will miss the first half of the 2017 season after testing positive for marijuana, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
 “We hold our athletes to the highest standard and they’re going to have consequences if they don’t live up to that standard,” UCF coach Scott Frost told the Orlando Sentinel. “We’re going to do everything we can for those two young men and hopefully they learn the lesson.”
According to the NCAA, the penalty for a positive test is an automatic suspension for half of the competitive season. Payton and Clarke will both miss a minimum of six games next season.
The failed NCAA-mandated drug tests were taken during the Knights’ Cure Bowl appearance.
Frost told the Orlando Sentinel that both players will be participating in spring football practices.



A UCF student says he was dared to jump into a shark-filled pool during a spring break trip to the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, according to Inside Edition. 
Michael Lay, a sophomore at UCF, told Inside Edition that there were 25 to 30 sharks inside the tank. After Lay jumps into the tank a lone shark can be seen swimming towards him. He gets out of the pool before the shark can reach him.

Will McCloskey, who was taking video of the stunt, told Inside Edition he didn’t believe Lay would jump into the pool. He told them that he was willing to pay his friend $1,000 to jump in the pool, but Lay said he would do it for free.
Lay was not hurt during the stunt. 
McCloskey says they have yet hear from the hotel about any potential repercussions.
