The new UCF/Valencia downtown campus will open fall 2019, with the help of many partnerships that gave money to see this project completed. 
UCF Downtown staff took media on a tour of the Dr. Phillips Academic Commons, the classroom building constructed with innovative learning in mind, and UnionWest at Creative Village which is where student housing will be located.
The campus will bring 7,700 students who will learn, live and work there, according to the UCF Downtown website. Work on the campus began in the summer of 2017 and the campus is set to open this fall semester, August 29. 
Although the buildings are up, interior furnishings have not been put in yet and there is still a lot of work left to be completed. With under three months left until opening day, it will require a lot of coordinated effort to finish it on time.











The most important thing to take away from this tour is that the views from the student housing rooms are amazing. It’s overlooking Camping World Stadium, Exploria Stadium, and the Amway Center.
Security for the campus will be upheld by UCF Police and the Orlando Police Department, to ensure students’ safety on a daily basis.
Over the years on the UCF main campus, parking has been an issue. At the UCF Downtown Campus, a 4-story parking garage with 580 spaces is currently under construction for the school. UnionWest at Creative Village will also have its own integrated parking garage for Staff and residents.
