UPDATE 9:30 P.M. – Portions of University Blvd. were being shutdown just before 9:30 p.m. KnightNews.com crews on scene confirmed it looked like OCSO deputies were looking for something on the street. Cars were being turned away from “The Plaza” filled with popular UCF bars and the McDonald’s as well. Check back for constant updates. 
Orange County Sheriff’s deputies set up a crime scene in “The Plaza” McDonald’s parking lot across from UCF to investigate a fatal shooting.
A second crime scene is set up in a parking lot farther west on University Blvd., in a plaza in the area between IHOP and World of Beer, as part of the investigation.
