Students at the University of Central Florida will gather for a vigil in remembrance of Trayvon Martin and to discuss the outcome of the recent trial where George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter.
Members of the Dream Defenders, along with the Mu Iota chapter of Delta Sigma Theta will gather on Thursday night to remember and honor the life and death of Trayvon Martin, “as well as open up the conversation about the George Zimmerman verdict,” a press release for the event said.
“These groups will be coming together for this event with other multicultural organizations and students of all colors to speak of Martin’s death and how racism, racial profiling, and discrimination still exists and affects us in this day and age,” a statement said.”We are calling people to come out, show support, and take a part of this event that is meant to bring awareness of the state of our community, the injustice that still exists to this day, and the fallacies of “Stand Your Ground.””
Martin was fatally shot in early 2012 by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. Zimmerman was recently found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter saying he acted in self-defense.
“Our mission is to train and organize youth and students in nonviolent civil disobedience, civic engagement, and direct action,” the Dream Defenders said in a statement. “We will confront the sources, sponsors, and supporters of the criminalization of our communities.”
The vigil will be held at 7:13 p.m. at the UCF Reflection Pond.
