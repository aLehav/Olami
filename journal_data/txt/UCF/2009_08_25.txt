Thousands of high school graduates were turned away from the University of Central Florida last year because of a high volume of applicants for the 2009 fall semester. In turn, UCF admissions raised the standards of a qualified applicant.
Those who were accepted and enrolled at UCF are part of a record-setting freshmen class.
According to preliminary enrollment data from UCF, the 3,800 new freshmen had an average high school GPA of 3.8 and SAT score of 1221. Both of these numbers are the highest in the history of UCF. In addition, the 500 freshmen of the Burnett Honors College also have the highest credentials in UCF’s history with an average GPA of 4.2 an SAT score of 1373.
According to UCF, the Knights are also welcoming an impressive 4,700 new transfer students this fall. UCF says the total enrollment has now reached 52,000 students after the incoming freshmen as well as transfer students.



Southbound lanes of Alafaya Trail were shutdown shortly from 1:30 p.m. until nearly 3 p.m. due to a vehicle crash with injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
The roadway reopened just before 3 p.m., but traffic likely will be backed up until the backlog clears.
There were two other accidents reported on Alafaya Trail at the same time, however it was not clear if all three accidents were related.
The Alafaya Trail corridor has been busy with UCF and Orange County Public Schools starting Monday.
There is no word yet how serious the injuries are, or whether a student was involved.
