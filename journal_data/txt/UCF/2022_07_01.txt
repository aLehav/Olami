The classic log flume water ride, “Splash Mountain” will be approaching its final days as it receives a “Princess and the Frog” makeover which will be called “Tiana’s Bayou Adventure” when it opens in late 2024 at Disney World’s Magic Kingdom. 
Carmen Smith, Disney senior vice president of Creative Development says “Tiana’s Bayou Adventure” will not be a retelling of the 2009 animated film “Princess and the Frog” but will act as a sequel of sorts taking place right after the original film ends. 
“Picking up where the film left off, guests will join Princess Tiana, Naveen and jazz-loving alligator Louis on an adventure through the bayou as they prepare to host a one-of-a-kind Mardi Gras celebration where everyone is welcome,” Smith said. 
The decision to change the beloved “Splash Mountain” that has been open since 1992, came from Disney CEO Bob Chapek who said he believes the “Zippity Doo Dah” attraction based on the controversial film, “Song of the South” didn’t belong in Disney parks anymore. 
“We continue to review our offerings for negative depictions of people and cultures, and we invest in new offerings and experiences to better reflect the diversity of stories in our world,” Chapek said. “The Splash Mountain attraction was originally based on ‘Song of the South,’ and we are eager to create an entirely new experiences that is more inclusive and inspirational for all guests.” 
“Tiana’s Bayou Adventure” will replace both Splash Mountain attractions in Disneyland and Disney World and will open in late 2024.
