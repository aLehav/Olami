The Republican Presidential nominees took the stage at the University of Colorado, Boulder Wednesday night for the third Republican Presidential Debate.
Here at the University of Central Florida, conservative students gathered together with Orange County Young Republicans at the Caddy Shank bar and grill. The students watched as the Republican candidates duked it out for the parties’ nomination.  

The third debate featured only the top 10 polling candidates left in the republican field. These candidates were: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, and John Kasich.
“The debate I think went pretty well tonight. I really enjoyed that the candidates decided to push back against the media for trying to use the debates as a way to make money and get better ratings,” UCF student Carter Lankes said.
Be sure to tune in to the next republican debate on November 10th, and check back to Knight News for more political coverage.
