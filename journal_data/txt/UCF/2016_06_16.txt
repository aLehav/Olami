Orlando City Soccer fans have asked those who are planning on attending Saturday’s OCSC tribute match versus San Jose Earthquakes at Camping World Stadium to put their purple away for one game. That is unless you are sitting in the supporters section, section 125, or sections P18-P25.
“This is our time to step up, as Orlando Residents, as City Supporters, and as Brothers and Sisters, to show the WORLD that we are #OrlandoUnited. Let’s #FillTheBowl one last time to give our city, and those whose lives were tragically cut short on Saturday morning a 70,000 person rainbow bowl tribute,” said on the Facebook page.
While the effort is not endorsed by the team or its front office, it is “truly a fan effort to show the true power of how OUR city comes together in the midst of tragedy” according to the Facebook page. It asks fans to band together to fill the bowl and paint a rainbow with each section displaying a different colored shirt.  
“Sports should be a unifier and a place where people come together to celebrate all that is good in life,” as said according to the open letter from Orlando City SC released on Monday. 
Orlando City SC has also planned other special events before, during and after the match to memorialize the tragedy and its victims. They have created a collaboration across sports teams in Central Florida, MLS’s Orlando City, NWSL’s Orlando Pride, NBA’s Orlando Magic, ECHL’s Orlando Solar Bears and AFL’s Orlando Predators by joining forces to sell #OrlandoUnited branded t-shirts were all the net proceeds will go to the City of Orlando’s OneOrlando Fund – OneOrlando.org. For more information on purchasing the t-shirts please visit here.
“We will do everything in our power to show the world that #OrlandoUnited cannot be defeated.”
