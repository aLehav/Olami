Hurricane Irene is growing stronger with max sustained winds at 90 mph, according to the 11 p.m. National Hurricane Center update, as it moves past the coast of Dominican Republic at 9 mph in a west north west direction.
Projections show Hurricane Irene coming close to the Florida coastline in the upcoming days. While the forecast track has moved more to the east of Florida than had been originally projected.
Even if Hurricane Irene remains off shore, it is large enough to potentially impact the UCF area with heavy winds and rains. KnightNews.com will keep in close contact with UCF officials to let you know if the storm should cancel class.
