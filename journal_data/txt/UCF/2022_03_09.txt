The UCF Men’s basketball team will get its final opportunity to make a push for the NCAA Tournament tomorrow.
The sixth-seeded Knights (17-11, 9-9 AAC) will take on rival 11-seed South Florida (8-22, 3-15 AAC) in the first round of the American Athletic Conference Tournament. 
The game will be nationally televised on ESPNU with tip-off set for 8 pm ET.
UCF split games with the Bulls this season, losing January’s matchup 75-51, but bouncing back in February with a 68-49 domination of its own.
The winner of battle three will advance to the second round to take on three-seed Memphis, who also split games with the Knights this season.
The Knights’ potential second round matchup will also be nationally televised on ESPNU with tip-off set for 10 pm on Thursday.
