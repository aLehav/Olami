If you’ve driven by the UCF Theta Chi fraternity house recently, you’ve probably noticed the former artwork appearing to say “Big Cox” on the front of the house has been painted over.
KnightNews.com never heard whether anyone got caught for this prank, but thought we might as well set the record straight and post this picture we shot earlier this week showing the clean Theta Chi fraternity house.
Around the same time the Theta Chi house vandalism happened, someone sent us pictures of a soapy UCF reflecting pond. We never heard if that person got caught either. Now that the semester is coming to a close and finals are upon us, it seems like the pranksters have settled down. (Or maybe they got a hold of some adderall and can’t help but study?)
