UCF says students willing to prove they are vaccinated may opt out of mandatory COVID-19 testing protocols, starting in Summer B.
The university will also begin to offer up to 100 doses of the Pfizer vaccine per day at the Student Health Center.
Dr. Michael Deichen, associate vice president of UCF Student Health Services, provided additional updates in a Friday news release: 
UCF announced last week that masks will no longer be required, but rather encouraged, for its faculty and students.
As the university moves toward pre-pandemic operations, Deichen said vaccines are key in allowing the campus community to return together again while also being protected from the virus.
Deichen also said UCF has so far provided nearly 20,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine at mass vaccination events held this year and said it is a huge step in building on the campus community’s health and safety.
“Getting vaccinated is so important for protecting yourself and our larger UCF community,” he said. “The risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 outweighs concerns about the side effects from the vaccine … vaccines are our number one tool for minimizing spread of the virus.”
The no-cost vaccine is available by appointment only to UCF students, faculty and staff, and individuals will need to return about three weeks after their first shot to receive their second dose. Appointments can be scheduled online by clicking this link.
