The UCF Sigma Nu fraternity has been suspended after UCF officials obtained a video of at least one member repeatedly using the word “rape,” according to documents released by a UCF spokesman.
The alleged incident occurred on June 9 at the Sigma Nu house off campus. There were four brothers present, according to the incident report.
In the video, there is at least one brother screaming, “Let’s rape some b*tches [expletive redacted], rape some sluts” and then continuing to say “rape” again and again, according to the UCF records. 
“She sent me the videos because she felt that they may be able to help me…,” said the student who filed the complaint, according to the records. 
KnightNews.com broke the story about a member of Sigma Nu being accused by UCF police of raping a woman last October. Prosectors had not filed formal charges against the student, but a UCF conduct panel found the accused fraternity member “in violation” of sexual misconduct. The fraternity was not charged as an organization in that incident. 
UCF did charge the fraternity as an organization with “condoning or encouraging acts of sexual misconduct” regarding the rape comments caught on tape, according to the records. 
The fraternity has been placed on an emergency suspension, prior to a full hearing scheduled for August 20, to determine if they’re in violation of UCF policy, according to the records.
Brad Beacham, Executive Director of the National Sigma Nu Fraternity, released a statement regarding the rape comments in the video.
“The words used by people in the recordings are disrespectful, despicable, and vile. The Fraternity and University are investigating the recordings. Following completion of the investigation, the Fraternity will take action as may be appropriate,” said Beacham.
