Earlier today, UCF Police responded to a 911 call from a witness who saw a toddler fall from the second story of Millican Hall.

The toddler, whoâ€™s father was in the vicinity, fell through a gap between the 2nd floor and the window, on the side of the building closest to the fountain and library.
UCF spokesman Chad Binette said that UCF will be installing a plexiglass barrier to prevent this from happening again.
The condition of the toddler is unknown at this time.
