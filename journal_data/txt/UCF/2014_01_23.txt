The Gatherings apartment complex off of University Boulevard near UCF has had at least 20 apartments evacuated because of a SWAT standoff with a barricaded man, according to News 13.
Authorities said the man that was barricaded inside his apartment, wanted for violating his probation. News 13 is also reporting that Page Private School was placed on lockdown during the standoff.
The man was arrested around 3 p.m. on Thursday without incident, Orange County Sheriff’s Office reports. 



After USF almost spoiled UCF’s storybook BCS championship-winning season, George O’Leary said that UCF would never wear the alternate black helmets worn in the win again.
According to the Orlando Sentinel, UCF will be selling the game worn helmets starting Friday morning to GKC Donors and season ticket holders for $450, while the authentic helmets not worn in the game will go for $350. 
The helmets will be chosen randomly and will be sold on a first-come-first-serve basis. Originally, the helmets were used as part of a “blackout” game even though UCF opted to wear the gold jerseys with the black helmets. 
All proceeds will go to football operations.



The Wayne M. Densch Charitable Trust has signed an Agreement to contribute $4,000,000 to UCF Athletics to construct the  new Wayne Densch Center for Student Athlete Leadership, name pending board approval.

The $4,000,000 donation, which is the largest charitable gift in UCF Athletics history, will help with moving expenses, construction of the building, and equipping and furnishing the Center. The Center is planned to be 24,000 square feet at an estimated cost of $6.5 million.
“We are very grateful to the Wayne Densch Charitable Trust and Leonard Williams for this record-setting gift,” UCF Vice President and Director of Athletics Todd Stansbury said. “Mr. Densch was a wonderful supporter of UCF Athletics and we’re absolutely thrilled to name the Wayne Densch Student-Athlete Leadership Center in his honor.
The donation is expected to fulfilled over a fifteen-year period, with the first $500,000 installment to be received by UCF Athletics by March 31, 2014.
 The Wayne Densch Student-Athlete Leadership Center will serve as the headquarters for UCF student-athletes’ personal, professional and academic development. It will house UCF’s Student-Athlete Leadership Institute, Academic Services for Student-Athletes, Student Services and Compliance departments, while also providing operations space to serve more than 500 student-athletes. The center will include a multi-purpose classroom which will hold 200 students, a computer lab, tutoring and mentoring rooms, study space and conference and resource rooms.
Originally, the Center was planned to be named the Center for Student Athlete Leadership, but UCF will officially name it the Wayne Densch Center for Student Athlete Leadership upon receiving $2,000,000 of the donation, pending board approval.
The Center will help student-athletes not only with leadership, but with programs that will help the student-athletes prepare for jobs after college including junior achievement partnerships and business incubator programs.
“The Wayne Densch Charitable Trust has been a stalwart supporter of UCF Athletics for decades,” said UCF President John C. Hitt. “This generous gift represents another milestone in the outstanding partnership between UCF and the Wayne Densch Charitable Trust to support our student-athletes.”
