A 20-year-old North Carolina man was arrested at the University of Central Florida on Wednesday after forcing a woman into a car, according to an article by the Orlando Sentinel.
According to the article, police said Tharien Graham and an unnamed woman traveled together from North Carolina to Florida to vacation. The woman left the hotel they were staying at to visit a friend on the UCF campus, and Graham went to there to find her. Once there, the two talked and the woman went to get her wallet from the car in Garage E. While looking for her wallet, Graham picked her up and forced her into the car, where he held her down onto the floorboard of the passenger seat and locked the doors, according to court records, the Sentinel reported.
Graham faces charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment and battery, according to the Sentinel.
