Milton joked he was cleared for practice in the video while Johnson said “10-hana.”
Johnson also announced earlier in the season McKenzie walked for the first time the weekend of the injury while still at Tampa General Hospital.
Milton’s appearance in the video shows a promising recovery after four surgeries. No other details are available on his timeline.
