I was checking out the farmer’s market in Waterford Lakes Town Center when I noticed dark, black smoke billowing above the parking lot and it was bad — it almost reminded me of how smoke gushes from oil fields when they’re set on fire in the Middle East.
When I walked up for a closer look, it turns out there was an RV-style vehicle that had just exploded into flames. 
As onlookers watched, firefighters were immediately on the scene to put out the flames. When I asked one of the firefighters if the truck had exploded (it obviously did), he responded with a playful remark of, “No, it just got a little overheated.”
KnightNews.com contributor, Zeve Salman was first on the scene and shot video of the smoke filling the air from his iPhone, you can view his raw footage below:

Since no one appeared to be injured, they could make light of the situation. Another firefighter with a sense of humor jokingly pointed his fire hose at me, as if I were on fire and he wanted to put me out.
Over an hour after the incident, the vehicle remained in the parking lot, emanating a potent, burnt smell as the water from the fire hoses dripped out of every hole in the vehicle.
