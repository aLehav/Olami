This past Saturday, the Kappa Sigma fraternity held a 5k run on the UCF campus in memory of its past advisor and UCF Alum, Brian Dornbusch. There was an entry fee of $22, with proceeds going toward the Brian Dornbusch Scholarship Fund and the American Cancer Society.
Joshua Hurtado, a brother of the Kappa Sigma fraternity said, “He cared deeply about the fraternity but, more importantly, about my progress as a man.” All of the brothers seem to share the same feelings, and are happy to see his memory being carried on.
The participants ran through various parts of campus, and the event saw entrants from a diverse group of students in the UCF community, not just those involved in Greek life. Earlier in the week, Kappa Sigma also held a BBQ to raise cancer awareness and to help promote the 5k. There were even a few brothers who walked across Florida to raise awareness.
In the end, there were close to 100 people who participated in the fundraiser, with more than $3,000 being raised. Chase Cavayero, a brother of Kappa Sigma, said he “would like to double that number next year.”
