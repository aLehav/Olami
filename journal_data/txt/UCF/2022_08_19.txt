The 6‚Äô1 190 lb. dual-threat quarterback commits UCF after spending the 2021 season as the Bulls starting quarterback for 11 of 12 games as a true Freshman. During his freshman campaign, McClain threw for 1,888 yards along with 5 touchdowns through the air and 7 interceptions in a season where the Bulls finished a woeful 2-10. 
McClain isn‚Äôt without his own history with the Knights, as McClain lead the Bulls down to the goal line in the final minute of USF‚Äôs season finale where the team narrowly lost 13-17. McClain finished the season and now his final game with the Knight‚Äôs rival throwing for 222 yards and a rushing touchdown. 
Since McClain transferred to UCF after July 1, he will be ineligible to play for the Knights during the 2022 season. Instead, the dual Threat quarterback will redshirt this upcoming season to compete for the starting job in Knights‚Äô first season in the Big 12 in 2023.  
McClain will be sure to find Central Florida home as he is a former Seminole High School Quarterback where he passed for an 6, 351 yards, 68 TDs and ran for over 940 yards with 17 touchdowns on the ground over the course of 36 games played.
