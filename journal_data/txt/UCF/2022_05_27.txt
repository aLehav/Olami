It’s out with the new, and in the with classics.
Universal Orlando Resort is honoring its most iconic movies in this year’s summer tribute store inside the Universal Studios Florida park.
The tribute store features merchandise from films including “E.T The Extra-Terrestrial,” “Jaws” and “Back to the Future.”
As you enter the tribute store, guests are immediately brought into what looks like a retro themed movie theater. The exterior walls of the theater display posters of what “movies” you will see when you enter.
Once you walk inside, you will head to the ticket booth for entry.
Your adventure through the movie theater starts in Theater 1, the “E.T.” room.
Here guests will step into a recreation of Elliot’s room where E.T. is waiting for your arrival.
Merchandise such as E.T. plush dolls, candles and even Elliot’s famous red hoodie are all available for purchase.
Be sure to keep a good eye out for any loose Reese’s Pieces laying around!
Also, fun fact, this year marks the 40th anniversary of the film!
Theater 2 holds the next classic Universal Pictures movie in our line-up, “Jaws.”
As you enter, guests are transported onto Amity Island.
While in Quint’s boat shack, merchandise such as shirts, bags and plush shark dolls fill up the room.
Remember to spend a few extra minutes in this room to find Easter eggs from the original Universal Studios Florida “Jaws” attraction that was removed in 2012.
The next room, Theater 3, is truly a blast from the past… or the future?
“Back to the Future” is the final classic film to be celebrated for this year’s summer tribute store.
Guests are free to roam around Doc’s garage which features neon lights, mugs, “Outatime” licenses plates, Hover Board posters and a display of Hill Valley.
Be sure to listen to the music that is playing in this room. You may recognize some of the songs from the original movies.
There is one final themed room before you exit. Theater 4 is filled with themed treats and extra merchandise that incorporates a ton of classic Universal Pictures movies.
Merchandise from “Jurassic Park”, “Psycho”, “The Breakfast Club”, “Kongfrontation” and many others can be found in this closing room.
Do you think you will check out this year’s tribute store?

The UCF Board of Trustees approved six projects this Thursday to make changes to the university’s football stadium and athletic village.
These renovations are all a part of the “UCF Athletics Association Football Campus Projects” which will transform the school’s athletic facilities to help recruit and retain student-athletes and coaches, according to the Board of Trustee’s document.
Here is a list of the six approved projects:
· Stadium South Tower: This project will add offices, club lounges, hospitality areas and executive leadership levels to the tower. Additionally, 4,600 bench seats will be removed to add more space for club lounge seating.
· Football Practice Field Relocation: Football practice field #1 will be moved to create the McNamara Cove

· Stadium North Tower: Approximately 5,000 seats will be added near the student section on the north end. Walkways will include new restrooms and concessions
The UCF Board of Trustees approved $4.8 million to help kickstart the designs for the project.
It is projected that the total cost of the all the renovations under the “UCF Athletics Association Football Campus Projects” will cost close to $125 million.
