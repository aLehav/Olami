The Jacksonville Jaguars are wasting no time signing their newly drafted seventh-round pick.
Former UCF running back Storm Johnson signed his rookie contact on Tuesday with the Jaguars, worth $2.28 million over four years.
“It is a dream come true,” Johnson told Jaguars.com. “My parents and a lot of people put a lot of time and work in. A lot of people in my circle have put a lot of time and work in. To see it all pay off and pulling in the right direction is a wonderful feeling.”
Johnson (6-feet-0, 216 pounds), was the no. 222 overall selection in the 2014 NFL draft. As a junior at UCF, he started all 13 games, rushing for 1,139 yards and 14 touchdowns on 213 carries.
“It’s just the beginning,” Johnson said of signing his contract. “It’s just the foot in the door. It’s just going to drive me to work harder and strive to take that next step and see what the next door to open is.”
Johnson joined sixth-round draftee Luke Bowanko as the second 2014 drafted Jaguar to sign a rookie contract.
