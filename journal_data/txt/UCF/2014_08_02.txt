UCF students looking to hit the gym over the next couple of weeks will not be able to use the UCF Recreation and Wellness Center main building gym.
The main building gym is closed until August 11, but the RWC at Knights Plaza will be open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. throughout the duration of the main gym being closed.
Once the main building gym opens up again, it will operate on the summer hour schedule. Monday thru Friday the main building gym will be open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and noon to midnight on Sunday.
The RWC at Knights Plaza will be closed from August 11 to August 16. 
Classes begin on August 18, and then the gym will be back on the normal schedule. 



UCF students looking to get a ride around Orlando will have new option with “Lyft”, which began on Thursday.
Lyft is a ride-sharing app that users can simply download, request a ride and a driver will come pick you up through your smartphone’s GPS.
The drivers are background-checked people using their everyday cars with the signature pink mustache on the front of the car to give rides. 
Lyft is offering specials along with its opening. Lyft is trying to get Orlando residents to be “Lyft Pioneers” and is offering them two weeks and 50 free rides at $25 a piece just for downloading the app.
Like its major competitor, Uber, Lyft is launching without local permits. However, this hasn’t discouraged the company from giving rides. 
“What I can tell you on that front is we have been in touch with city leaders and had positive discussion, and we’ll work on a permanent solution to make sure ride-sharing can thrive in Orlando,” company spokeswoman Katie Dally said.
