As if being stopped by police wasn’t nerve-wracking enough, there may be police impersonators on the University of Central Florida campus…
“The UCF Police Department today received a report about two people believed to be impersonating police,” a Campus Awareness email said.
The email stated that a female driver reported she was entering campus via Central Florida Blvd. when a car flashing red and blue lights pulled up behind her.
The driver said she pulled the car over but then took off when she noticed the man approaching her car was not dressed in uniform.
The driver believed the lights were coming from someone inside the car holding a smartphone, according to the email.
UCFPD said the woman did the right thing by calling the police in the suspicious situation and encourages others to do the same.  
If being pulled over, UCFPD recommends turning on the vehicle’s hazard lights and pulling into a well-lit area.      
UCFPD officers have blue uniforms and carry department-issued ID.
“If you’re concerned about the identity of the person who pulled you over, call 911 to verify who they are. Never roll down your windows or open your door if you believe the person pulling you over is not a police officer,” the email stated.   
If you see any suspicious activity, contact UCFPD at 407-823-5555.



Two student groups are teaming up on Friday to demonstrate on behalf of refugees displaced by the ongoing crisis in Syria.
Campus Peace Action and Students Organize for Syria are planning the rally for 12:30 tomorrow at the Reflection Pond.
According to a Facebook page created for the event, the purpose of the rally is “to show support for Syrian refugees and help break stereotypes about immigrants.”
The mission statement of Campus Peace Action is “to turn fear into understanding, intolerance into acceptance, and apathy into action through education, community building, and creativity at the University of Central Florida.”
