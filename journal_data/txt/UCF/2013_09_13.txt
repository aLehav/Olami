UCF Speaker of Senate, Anthony King, faces a motion of no confidence after Thursday’s SGA Senate meeting.
The motion was raised by Deputy Pro Tempore Leo Atencio, who proposed the motion in response to the failure of committees to submit reports that are required by SGA statutes.
The statues state that if a Committee Chair fails to submit a committee report for two Senate meetings the Chair of that committee must resign from that position.
The motion will be voted on at the next Senate meeting on September 19. If a Senate majority votes in favor of the motion, the Speaker is resigned from the position.
