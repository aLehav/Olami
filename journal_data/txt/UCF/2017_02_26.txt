The UCF student section stormed the court in CFE Arena after the Knights defeated No. 15 Cincinnati Sunday afternoon.
A huge season high 27 points by UCF’s B.J. Taylor put away the score at 53-49 by game’s end, with contributions from Matt Williams and Tacko Fall.
Watch CFE Arena erupt into cheers:
March, is that you?! @UCF_MBB takes down No. 15 Cincy, 53-49!! #ChargeOn pic.twitter.com/UG0j7A0nyy

UCF (19-10, 10-7 AAC) and Cincinnati (25-4, 14-2 AAC) met in early February when the Bearcats handed the Knights a 60-50 loss. Prior to the game, the all-time series was held at 8-0 in favor of Cincinnati.
The final home game of the season against the toughest opponent Dawkins and team have met thus far presented itself with a win that will be remembered by UCF Basketball for seasons to come, along with a second-ever victory earned against Memphis by UCF in its program history early this year.
Stay tuned for a post-game press conference recap with head coach Jonny Dawkins.
