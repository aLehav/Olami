Approximately 2500 students gathered around the Reflecting Pond to watch the Great American Solar Eclipse, the first solar eclipse to move across the United States in almost 40 years.
The totality of the eclipse for the UCF area was estimated at 85%.
The University of Central Florida handed out hundreds of solar protection glasses as well as t-shirts commemorating the event on the first day of the Fall semester.
