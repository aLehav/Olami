The wait is finally up because the annual Zeta Tau Alpha new member lip sync competition is back! The ladies of ZTA are pairing up with Kappa Sigma to host the event tonight at UCF. The event will be held in The Venue where doors will open at 6pm and the competition will start at 7pm.
All of UCF’s Greek Life will be showing off their fraternity and sorority new member classes as they compete for a cause. The main purpose of this event is to raise money and awareness for breast cancer. All of the proceedings raised at the dance competition and the fundraisers held the week prior to Lip Sync will go to Breast Cancer Awareness and Education.
Leading up to the main event, Zeta hosted their annual “Kiss Away Breast Cancer” in front of the student union where students were able to kiss the breast cancer banner and support the cause.  Zeta also decided to do a new fundraiser this year and held a BBQ at Lake Claire on Thursday, September 20th. Tickets were just $5 and the event included food, music, and a slip and slide.
There is a suggested $1 donation fee to see the new member classes compete for the best dance and help support the fight against breast cancer.

KnightNews.com will be broadcasting LIVE at the event. Check back later for the live video which will begin at 7pm.
