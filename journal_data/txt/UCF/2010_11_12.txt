The Sterling Central Apartment complex, located on Alafaya Trail across from UCF, had its fire alarms sound at approximately 2 a.m. this morning, due to a supposed fire.
Fire Rescue responded to a call claiming there was smoke coming out of the second floorâ€™s hallway. However, the smoked turned out to be nothing more than a prank. Two fire extinguishers were sprayed in the hallway, and gave off a smoke-like appearance.
Residents gathered outside in the cold, most of them wearing their pajamas, as the firefighters entered the building to find our what caused the alarms to sound. Most residents wanted to simply return to their apartments and go back to sleep, but the authorities kept everyone contained in one location outside while residents speculated as to what was happening.
