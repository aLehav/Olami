When UCF student Rachel Cole isn’t working at the Victoria’s Secret headquarters in Ohio as a campus intern, she is looking to  become the new face of Hawaiian Tropic.
Cole, an Ad/PR major at UCF and originally hailing from Canada, applying to be the next face of Hawaiian Tropic came naturally to her. Making the transition to Florida from up North made her realize how hot Florida actually is and that “SPF 50 is her best friend”.
Cole is one of five finalists out of over a thousand submissions, the winner will get flown to Hawaii to become the new spokesperson for the brand.
“I just love Hawaiian Tropic, and I love UCF. It would mean so much to me to have my fellow Knights support me in this contest. I think it’d be amazing to have the new face of Hawaiian Tropic be a Knight,” said Cole.
Voting lasts until July 19. Watch the finalists videos here.
