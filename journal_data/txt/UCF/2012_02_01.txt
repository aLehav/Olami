Orlando police have deployed divers in a new search for missing mom Michelle Parker, unfolding in a lake near Orange Blossom Trail.
Michelle Parker flier
That’s according to the Orlando Sentinel, which reports OPD got a credible tip that evidence may be in the lake behind a closed OBT nightclub. 
The case got national attention as Parker disappeared the same day she appeared on The People’s Court, having it out with her fiance Dale Smith. Smith has been named the prime suspect in the case, but he denies wrongdoing and has not been charged by police. 
The couple has young twins.
