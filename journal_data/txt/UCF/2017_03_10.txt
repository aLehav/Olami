The University of Central Florida’s on-campus arena – CFE Arena – has ranked second among all university venues nationally by Venues Today Magazine with a capacity of 5,001-10,000.
The new spot at second place brought up the arena from fifth place last year and an eighth consecutive spot on the list year after year. Rankings are based on gross event revenue for the 2016 event season (December 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016).
Managed by Spectra, CFE Arena celebrates its tenth year at UCF (2007-17).
Artists and acts such as Tool (which produced a record-setting sell-out), Amy Schumer, Ellie Goulding, Meghan Trainor, Pentatonix, Disney Live, Katt Williams, K92’s Country Strong—a benefit for the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, Sesame Street Live, WWE NXT, alumnus Daniel Tosh, UCF and other college and high school graduations, and, of course, UCF Men’s and Women’s Basketball home games, according to CFE Arena.
“Spectra Venue Management and UCF worked hand-in-hand to produce CFE Arena’s highest grossing revenue year ever in 2016,” said Spectra General Manager of CFE Arena Brian Hixenbaugh.
“We have another very successful year planned for 2017 to celebrate CFE Arena’s 10th year on the campus of the UCF, and look forward to providing quality entertainment for the Central Florida community in the coming years.”
