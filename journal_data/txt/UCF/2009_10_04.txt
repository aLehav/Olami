After seeing our recent UCF tailgating coverage from Memory Mall, the Sigma Chis invited KnightNews.com inside their fraternity house to show us how they tailgate during family weekend.
Sigma Chi brothers Bryan Groc and Dan Nicoletti gave us the exclusive video tour of their tailgate, sponsored by Monster Energy, which proved parents can still keep up with the college crowd — or at least have fun trying!
Stick around for the end of the video and you’ll see what we mean.
