Tre and Torian Fields, 22, auditioned for the cast of VH1’s newest show “Twinning” back in August 2014. Almost one year later, they and 11 other sets of twins will premiere on VH1’s Twinning next Wednesday, July 22, at 10 p.m. E.T. to compete for the grand prize of $222,222.22.
“Twinning” is a reality TV show that will put twins and their bonds to a test. All sets of twins will be separated from each other and will be living in two different houses. 
Although the twins aren’t UCF students, they’re living the college dream, living together in East Orlando while they save up money for their next adventures. Tre enjoys editing videos and taking pictures while Torian is a self-declared ladies man.
The new show has been getting all kinds of attention on social media and has even been advertised on Times Square billboards in New York City. 
The Fields twins will appear on Good Morning America on Wednesday morning to help break a Guinness world record for the largest parade of tandem bikes. VH1 recruited 150 sets of twins in order to break the record and promote the new series “Twinning.”

Seminole County Fire Department assisted the State Fire Marshal’s Office in investigating the cause of Sunday’s fire at Tivoli Apartments near the University of Central Florida.

SCFD public information officer, Paula Thompson, announced the cause of fire is undetermined but they believe it to be accidental.
Jadon Stringfellow, who lived on the third floor, says the fire affected him in more ways than one. Along with losing clothing, shoes, and other personal belongings, he says he now has to worry about finding and paying for a new place to live.
