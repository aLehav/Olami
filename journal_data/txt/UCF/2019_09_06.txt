In the wake of Hurricane Dorian, UCF is encouraging the Knights community to consider donating their unwanted supplies to Knights Pantry — an SGA funded food pantry which aids students in need of basic supplies such as food, toiletries, and clothing items.  
We encourage you to remember that @KHKPantry is available to take donations of any of your extra hurricane supplies.The Pantry is open 10 a.m. – 5 p.m. every weekday or donations can be made around the clock at any of the donation bins spread across campus.#HurricaneDorianUCF
Donations of any kind can be dropped off during business hours at the President’s office inside of  Millican Hall or anytime at donation bins across campus. 
According to UCF, Knights Pantry began from a class project in 2009 as a “grassroots initiative strived to ensure that UCF students would not have to choose between buying textbooks or buying groceries.”
