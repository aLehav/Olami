The 2021-22 NFL playoffs kicked off this past weekend and Knight Nation had six different reasons to tune in.
The University of Central Florida saw six of its football alumni compete in the NFL playoffs this weekend.
WR Gabriel Davis (2017-19), DB Tay Gowan (2017-20), WR Breshad Perriman (2012-14), DT Trysten Hill (2016-18), DB Mike Hughes (2015-17), and K Matt Prater (2002-05) all had the opportunity to represent UCF in the NFL Wild Card round.
Let’s break down how each former Knight performed in the opening round of the playoffs.
In Buffalo’s blistering cold battle vs. the New England Patriots on Saturday night, Gabriel and the Bills absolutely dominated the Patriots en rout to a 47-17 victory.
Gabriel caught just two passes, but each reception made a significant impact.
The two receptions went for a total of 41 yards, one of them being a 19-yard touchdown to extend the Bills’ lead to 40-10.

The other was a 22-yard reception which put the Bills in New England territory early in the second quarter.  The drive ultimately resulted in a three-yard Devin Singletary rushing touchdown which put the Bills up 20-0.
Gabriel and the Bills’ divisional round opponent has yet to be determined.
Gowan was listed as inactive in the Eagles’ 31-15 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.
Gowan — who the Eagles traded for on Oct. 15 — finished the 2021-22 season with two tackles.
In Tampa Bay’s victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, Perriman caught one pass for five yards.
Perriman will get an opportunity to play a bigger role in the Buccaneers’ divisional matchup next weekend.  They will play the winner of tonight’s battle between the Los Angeles Rams and the Arizona Cardinals.  
The game is set to kick off next Sunday at 3 pm.
In the Cowboys’ 23-17 loss vs. the San Francisco 49ers, Hill finished the game with two assisted tackles.
With the loss, Dallas was eliminated from the playoffs.
Hill finished the season with 11 tackles and 0.5 sacks.
In Kansas City’s dominant 42-21 Sunday night victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Hughes recorded two solo tackles, tying for the team’s fourth-most.
Hughes, however, gave up a 15-yard touchdown to Steelers wide receiver James Washington — who “Mossed” Hughes — rising above the former Knight to complete the acrobatic catch in the fourth quarter.
Hughes will get the opportunity to make up for the unfortunate play next Sunday when the Chiefs host the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round.  Kickoff is set for 6:30 pm.
Prater and the Cardinals will visit the Los Angeles Rams tonight for their Wild Card matchup at 8:15 pm.
