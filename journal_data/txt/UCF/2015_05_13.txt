A car collision occurred on North Alafaya Trail between East Colonial Drive and Challenger Parkway Tuesday night.
Carlton Ross and Cassie Smith, new Full Sail University Alumi, were stopped at the Challenger Parkway light on Alafaya in a Ford F-150 when they felt a “really big impact from behind,” said Smith.
Smith told KnightNews.com that the crash occurred between four cars.
When KnightNews.com arrived at the scene, Orange County Fire Rescue was cutting open a vehicle too crushed to identify.
“The driver was stuck, couldn’t get out, open her door or anything,” said Smith.
A woman and child were inside the vehicle that was cut open, according to Smith. They were transported in an ambulance. It is not confirmed by officials if it was a mother and her kid.
Smith said that four people were transported in the ambulances.
A bystander, who said he was a friend of a woman taken away in the ambulance, said that crash victim was a UCF student, but officials have not confirmed that yet.
We are working to find out more information on this crash and the conditions of the victims.
