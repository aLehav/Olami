UCF head coach Johnny Dawkins and the Knights just snatched away a high-impact player from a conference foe.
Sophomore forward Brandon “Suggie” Suggs announced to Twitter on Monday that he will be transferring to the University of Central Florida.
Suggs had narrowed his choices down to South Florida and the Knights.
The announcement came just over three weeks after entering the transfer portal.
Suggs, a 6-foot-6, 185-pound small forward, spent the past three seasons at East Carolina University, where he averaged 10.1 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.5 steals per game for the Pirates this season.
“Suggie” will be the fourth member of the Knights’ 2022 recruit class, joining incoming freshmen twins Taylor and Tyler Hendricks, along with Indiana University transfer center Michael Durr.
The group is headlined by Taylor Hendricks, a four-star recruit from Calvary Christian Academy in Fort Lauderdale, FL.  Hendricks is ranked the No. 70 prospect in the nation and the No. 13 player in Florida by 247sports.
Tyler Hendricks is a three-star recruit, who ranked No. 300 in the nation and No. 30 in Florida.
The class ranks No. 60 in the country, according to 247sports.
