UCF landed a huge commitment this weekend from 4-star wide receiver Tristan Payton. 
Payton decommitted from the University of Southern California(USC) on Friday and committed to the Knights during his official recruiting visit over the weekend. 
“I’m blessed to say that I’ve committed to the University of Central Florida #ChargeOn #GoKnights #UCF,” Payton tweeted out on Sunday morning. 
Payton, a 6-foot, 182-pound receiver out of Jacksonville First Coast, is rated the No. 30 wide receiver in the nation by 247sports.com and in No. 95 overall in the ESPN300 rankings. 
Payton turned down offers from the University of Florida, University of Miami, Ohio State and Auburn to join the Knights, who have a history of molding wide receivers into NFL-caliber players.
As a senior, Payton caught 47 passes for 843 yards and eight touchdowns, at an average of 17.9 yards per catch.
