For the first time in program history, UCF will appear on network television as the American Athletic Conference announced Saturday evening that ABC will televise the UCF Knights taking on the South Carolina Gamecocks.
Bright House Networks Stadium is expected to be at crowd capacity for the game for the first time since UCF played Boston College in 2011, according to UCF Athletics. The game also takes place during parents and family weekend.

The previous clash with South Carolina also was a national telecast as they opened 2005 on a Thursday on ESPN. The Gamecocks lead the series, 3-0, and this will be their first trip to Orlando to face UCF.
The Knights will receive more exposure on a national network like ABC — over ESPN, for example — because cable isn’t needed to watch ABC. The game against South Carolina will be a full national telecast on ABC.
