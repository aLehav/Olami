20-year old UCF student Santiago Diaz Arteaga was killed on Monday when he lost control of his car and hit a pole on Lake Pickett Road, the Florida Highway Patrol told the Orlando Sentinel. 
Diaz Arteaga was on his way to a chemistry exam, driving west near Tanner Road at 12:40 p.m. when his 2002 Honda veered off of the pavement and struck a pole on the driver’s side, troopers told the Orlando Sentinel. Diaz Arteaga was wearing a seatbelt, but died at the scene of the accident.
Diaz Arteaga moved from Pembroke Pines to Orlando in January to attend UCF, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
Investigators are trying to determine why he lost control of the car. 



A 570-foot roller coaster is planned to come to Orlando’s International Drive.
Named the “Skycoaster”, work on the coaster is scheduled to start next year and is planned to be opened sometime in 2016, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The structure will be so high, it would require special Federal Aviation Administration clearance before construction on the roller coaster can start.
The Skycoaster would be located near the currently under construction Mango’s Tropical Cafe near Sand Lake Road and I-Drive.
The Skycoaster’s design is expected to have an observation platform at the top with retail and a coaster track that would spiral all the way down.
According to the Orlando Business Journal, U.S. Thrill Rides founder Bill Kitchen told them that the coaster would be able to handle 1,600 people per hour at a cost of $18 per rider.
More details on the Polercoaster are expected at a news conference on Thursday.
