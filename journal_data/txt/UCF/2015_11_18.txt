ORLANDO, Fla. – The battle of the big men at UCF men’s basketball home opener was very sloppy, but the team showed fight throughout despite dropping a tight game to UC Irvine 61-60 in overtime.
“It came down to the last couple plays and they made some plays and we didn’t, but I felt like we battled the whole game. We looked better defensively, we got some good stops and we just didn’t finish a couple plays,” redshirt sophomore forward AJ Davis said.
Freshman Tacko Fall finally met someone his own size (7-foot-6) and got off to a quick start with two consecutive blocks to open the game against the Anteater’s redshirt junior center Mamadou Ndiaye.
“I mean, I just did my job. I had to play good defense on [Mamadou Ndiaye] and make a statement once the game started and that’s what I did,” Fall said.
The freshman center broke out registering 4 blocks and 7 rebounds as he managed to stifle Ndiaye and get him into early foul trouble. Fall was not fazed by Mamadou Ndiaye on either side of the court leaving redshirt junior center one for five by the end of the night with only one rebound.
Turnovers doomed much of the first half for the Knights, however they made up for it on the glass with 33 rebounds in comparison to UC Irvine’s 16 boards. However, the Knight’s gaffes on the offensive side did not cost them much though because they entered halftime down a basket.
“We rebounded the ball unbelievably tonight. I don’t think I have ever since that big of a margin there with rebounds, so we are going to be a good rebounding team and defensively that will help us a lot,” UCF head coach Donnie Jones said.
Redshirt sophomore AJ Davis took on the role of point forward and was dominant in just his second outing in the black and gold, leading the way for the Knights with 19 points, 5 assists and 4 rebounds.
“I think in any game we go into it’s about reads and looks and what the defense gives us,” Davis said. “They were playing [Adonys Henriquez] really tight, they didn’t let him get any good looks and of course he’s a great scorer.”
Coming out of the half though, UCF looked re-energized and sophomore Adonys Henriquez made his presence known with two 3-pointers to give UCF the lead early in the second half. The rest of the Knights followed suit as well, shooting 50 percent from the field in the second half which helped keep them in the game after the lackluster first half.
Senior forward Shaheed Davis led the team in rebounds with 12 while Tacko Fall and senior Staphon Blair manned the paint, forcing UC Irvine to take more outside shots in order to win the game.
UC Irvine’s penchant for the 3-pointer kept the team in it though, knocking down 7 of 18 from long range. Sophomore guard Luke Nelson accounted for 4 of those three pointers and led the Anteaters with 22 points and 6 assists.
Nelson’s up-and-under layup with a minute remaining gave the Anteaters a 2 point lead, but the Knights responded quickly with a Tacko Fall dunk to tie up the game and send it into overtime.
The overtime period carried over the physical defense and turnover-happy play from the first two halves as UC Irvine outscored UCF just 3-2, which resulted in the Anteaters handing the Knights their second loss in as many games.
“That was like an NCAA tournament game. Both teams, a very physical game, defensive grind-out,” Jones said. “I thought it was a well played game from both teams and you know we had our opportunities down the stretch there.”
UCF will look to turn the tide and get in the win column when they take on UNC Greensboro this Saturday at 7 p.m. at the CFE Arena.
 
 



On Monday night UCF hosted its twenty-second annual hunger banquet in the Pegasus Ballroom, where hundreds of students gathered to gain awareness on this pressing issue.
At the event, students were split into three groups, low, middle and high class. 
The students were then served a meal coinciding with their economic class. The low class was served a ration of rice and water and sat on the floor, the middle class was served a sandwich, and the high class was served a nutritious dinner and sat at a table prepared with silverware and napkins. This was done to make students aware of the different circumstances in which people live. 
Guest speakers spoke of their experiences dealing with the hungry and informed UCF students of what they could do to take action. 
After the event, Knight News caught up with the director of the event, as well as students in attendance to get their take on the banquet.




The Aramark proposal that would allow The University of Central Florida’s meal plan provider to replace all restaurants in the Student Union has stirred up controversy among the university.

Business owners and some students alike believe UCF’s dining options should not become a monopoly.
General Manager of Topper’s Creamery Charlene Robinson is upset about the possibility of her ice cream store closing down.
“If they come in, that means that we would have to leave if they take over and push everybody out. I hope that doesn’t happen. We’re building our company and being a part of UCF is a dream come true because you’re working with family,” Robinson said.
Scott Kaylor, UCF alum and co-owner of Wackadoos said it’s unfair for UCF to treat alumi businesses this way.
“If the university keeps pushing all the alumni away, I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future. It just seems like we’re worried about business and corporate america this and that but we’re getting away from the fundamentals that made this university great,” Kaylor stated.
Kaylor and Robinson are both upset that the students are not getting a say in the proposal.
“The students are the ones that pay the tuition and they’re the reason that we’re here so they really should have a say in this,” Robinson said.
“What happened to student rights? Students don’t know about what’s going on. I mean, this should have been brought for discussions, the students should have voted, especially in their building,” Kaylor said.
Both Topper’s and Wackadoos employ many students, a chance Robinson and Kaylor don’t believe a corporate takeover will give.
Robinson emphasized the importance of everyday interactions between Topper’s and its customers.
“Everybody should be aware of this, it shouldn’t be a select few,” Robinson said.
Many students have also expressed that they would not be happy with Aramark taking over the Union, both through emails and social media.
SGA Senator Jacob Milich sent KnightNews.com an email to voice student concerns about the proposal.
“UCF has not done its due diligence in order to determine how the student body feels about this decision. No large scale effort has been made to ask what the students think about this proposal and its possible consequences. A senior ranking member of the SGA has even been quoted as saying that ‘Students are pleased with Aramark’s food services…’ which can only be speculation because a statistically significant and representative sampling of students has not been asked. The Board of Trustees should delay this vote until the true opinion of the student body can be conclusively demonstrated,” Milich said.
Milich said that students are concerned for the food safety in the union, environmental concerns to the outside wooded area and small business operations.
“UCF is supposed to be ‘America’s Partnership University, but that shouldn’t only extend to large corporations looking to benefit from our school. We should extend that ethos to the small businesses that have been a part of our community for so long. The business owners have expressed that this deal came as a surprise and they deserve better than that from UCF,” the SGA senator said.
“Surprise” seems to be a common theme among business owners and students. Kaylor said he found out about the proposal through an article in the Orlando Sentinel.
Despite the idea that the proposal was “rushed,” KnightNews.com obtained emails between UCF and Aramark that show this deal has been in the works since June.
The emails show that UCF sent a “letter of commitment” in August and Aramark responded saying it was “in full agreement” and agreed “the terms of this agreement be kept confidential” until after notifications to current vendors had occurred.
Throughout this process, Milich said there has not been “an acceptable level of transparency from UCF administration.” He also stated that the vote seems rushed and inconvenient for students because it is held off campus and the same day as a football game.
“This proposal may be lucrative to UCF but the students should be the priority and the students should get the final say on what they want in their own student union,” Milich said.
Voting for the proposal will take place Nov. 19 at Northview.
Businesses from the union and student organizations said they will be there to speak their minds.
