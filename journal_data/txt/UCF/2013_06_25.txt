The start of summer B means an influx of new freshman living in dorms on campus. For fraternities, that means that it is recruitment season.
Fraternities across UCF will be finding new members across campus to join their organization whether they are freshman, sophomore, etc.
This will also be the first fall rush that the Interfraternity Council completely broke away from tent recruitment, meaning that there will be no more official tent recruiting in Memory Mall or Lake Claire. However, some fraternities may still elect to rent a rush tent. Fraternities will now be in a constant recruitment period to find new members.
KnightNews.com compiled all of the upcoming rush events for the upcoming week. If your organization has a rush event that would like to be publicized e-mail us at news@knightnews.com.
