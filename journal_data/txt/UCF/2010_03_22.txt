Greek Week continued to be a success with its second event, Greek Games, on Sunday March 21st. The event began at 11 a.m. and lasted until 4 p.m. Different fraternities and sororities joined groups and each were randomly assigned a superhero ranging from the Batman to Power Rangers. Each group also had to have one of their members dress up as this superhero.  Here is a short video chronicling some of the events.

The groups then competed in several unique olympic style games. These included an ice melting contest, jousting tournament, a can building contest for charity, a canoe race, a tug of war, a burrito shot-put contest, a toga race, and a chariot race. Despite messy rain conditions the event went on successfully with many eager participants. All of the results are scheduled to be announced Sunday March 28th at the Greek Gala.
