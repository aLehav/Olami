The UCF class of 2017â€™s first round of summer orientations have officially begun, meaning the new students are only weeks away from starting classes.
Summer orientations began on Monday as hundreds of students (and parents) visited the University of Central Florida to tour, learn important information and register for classes.
KnightNews.com caught up with new Knights who will be attending UCF for the first time this Fall to find out what made them choose UCF as well as other information about their plans here. Watch the video below.
