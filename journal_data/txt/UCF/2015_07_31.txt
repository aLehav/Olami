On July 31, Orlando City Soccer Club hosted a press conference in the city of Orlando to announce the development of its new downtown stadium.
An average match attendance of 34,000, with a large fan and market response, led Orlando City to make the decision to privately fund the stadium earlier this year, and include additional enhancements to improve guest experiences. The design aims to create the loudest and most intimidating atmosphere in Major League Soccer.
“We are thrilled with the work to date and proud to unveil the latest set of renderings for our home in downtown,” said Majority Owner Flavio Augusto da Silva at the conference. “This new privately financed stadium will be a state-of-the-art venue for our club and for our fans. It will also create more jobs for the community and bring significant economic impact to the city of Orlando and surrounding communities. With construction underway, we look forward to hosting the first games in the new stadium next year.”
Orlando City Soccer Club also released venue enhancements for the stadium, which include:
The site of the Lions’ home sits two blocks away from the Amway Center and will be within walking distance to Downtown Orlando’s Church Street and Orange Avenue.
Estimated completion of the stadium has been slated for summer of 2016.Another look at the new Orlando City SC stadium.
