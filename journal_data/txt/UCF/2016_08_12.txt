The University of Central Florida Domino’s location became the recipient of the pizza chain’s new DXP delivery car after a national voting contest took place.
The delivery car, a Chevrolet Spark, comes equipped with a warming oven that heats up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, a delivery-focused interior with custom compartments and seating for one, an ‘out-for-delivery’ illuminated sign, as well as a new look to the way the company delivers, according to Domino’s.
Now in service, students who will be ordering in the UCF-area beginning in the Fall may see the car in use.

The DXP car can also be seen with the university’s new license plate, released to the public for sale on August 5, 2016.
