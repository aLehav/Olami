SGA sources have confirmed to KnightNews.com that UCF SGA Speaker of the Senate Drew Pope announced his resignation Thursday night during the Senate meeting.
KnightNews.com has learned school and personal reasons prompted his resignation. 
UCF student leaders are required to maintain a 2.5 GPA and also remain in overall good standing with UCF to hold a leadership position. It is unclear what Pope’s GPA is because it is protected by FERPA, a federal privacy law, and could only be made public if Pope chose to disclose it. 
During a phone conversation with KnightNews.com Thursday night, Pope declined to comment on his resignation. 
The Speaker of the Senate is one of the highest paid positions in SGA, often drawing a monthly pay of more than $1,000 derived from student fees.

Matthew McCann and Adam Brock were sworn in as the new UCF SGA President and Vice President last week. 
KnightNews.com interviewed the new SGA administration asking about its future goals, cabinet selection and the UCF arboretum.  
McCann and Brock talked about a new way of ushering in transparency by placing the budget online on the SGA website, and even placing the bids gathered online. 

When talking about the arboretum McCann said, “We are going to make decisions that accurately reflect the overall student interest, and in the referendum 87 percent of students who participated in the referendum said that they want to support the UCF arboretum, and as student leaders it is our responsibility to make sure that we voice these concerns to the administration and different parties involved, so we can work together to bring a mutually beneficial outcome.”
One of the ideas McCann was most excited about was the “print at home” idea, in which students can print their work at home and pick it up at UCF.
