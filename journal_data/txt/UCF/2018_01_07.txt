The UCF Knights celebrated their perfect season today with at Walt Disney. UCF fans showed up in mass numbers and showed their support.  Chants of Black and Gold echoed throughout the park.
We heard from star players Shaquem Griffin and McKenzie Milton.  Who had face to face interactions with all of the fans after coming down from their float.  They were the grand finale of a perfect parade.  
We also got some one on one interactions with Danny White and President Hitt.  Be on the lookout for our video feature with them tomorrow afternoon.
