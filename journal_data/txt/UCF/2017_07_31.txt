The National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Six early Monday morning.
Two hours later, Tropical Storm Emily formed and became the fifth named storm of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season.
Wind gusts of close to 60 mph closed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg; six inches of rain have been reported.
“Upon learning of this tropical system from the National Hurricane Center, the state of Florida immediately engaged to prepare for any potential storm impacts,” Florida Governor Rick Scott said.
Tropical Storm Emily will likely weaken to a tropical depression as it makes its way through Florida, moving to the Atlantic by Tuesday morning.
