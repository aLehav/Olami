The Orlando Solar Bears announced that the UCF hockey team will face off against South Carolina on November 7 in the first ever college hockey game at the Amway Center, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
“This first college game is a jumping-off point for more big-time hockey to come,” John Bisignano, president and CEO of the Central Florida Sports Commission, told the Sentinel.
Before UCF will go up against South Carolina, the Solar Bears will play against the Florida Everblades at 7 that night.
Tickets purchased for the Solar Bears-Everblades game will be good for the UCF-South Carolina contest.
The Knights have made 9 consecutive appearances in the national tournament under current head coach Sean Weaver. Both UCF and South Carolina compete in Division III of the American Collegiate Hockey Association, according to the Sentinel.



It was announced on Tuesday that the Orange County Commissioners unanimously approved street lighting to be added to the University Hylands Area which includes 8 off-campus Greek houses and approximately 120 students.
Knight News obtained the email from Clay Coleman, the Director of Fraternity of Sorority Life, announcing the decision to members of the UCF community.
An order has been placed with Duke Energy to begin the project and should be completed in time for the Fall 2016 semester, the email showed.
