University of Central Florida SGA President Nick Larkins formally withdrew his censure filed against Speaker Josh Bolona Friday.
“As you all are aware, this week, I filed an Censure Request against Josh Bolona,” Larkins said in an email.
“Although I stand firm in my assertion that the Speaker either knowingly mislead the senate on how to overturn a veto, or he is severely misinformed on the proper protocol, following his admission of wrongdoing both in my office and during his remarks last night at Senate, I would formally like to withdraw my Censure request.”
Larkins vetoed two bills brought to his desk and deemed them unfit to move forward, according to the Student Body President, and emailed the Senate with his reasoning in addition to disappointment with the Speaker. 
Knight News will provide more updates tonight on the unexpected withdraw.
