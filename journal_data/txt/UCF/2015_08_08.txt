The American League held its annual media day in Rhode Island, where officials announced UCF’s prospected finish as the second best in the East Division.
Thirty of the League’s media representatives voted, with results adding to 29 of 30 first place votes going to Cincinnati and a third straight conference title vote going to UCF, who has gone 15-1 in conference play since league debut in 2013.
The 2013 season yielded an undefeated 8-0 UCF record for the conference title, with the Knights going 7-1 in 2014, conceding a lone game only to UConn to share a trophy.
Both campaigns led to a UCF championship and invitations to the Tostito’s Fiesta Bowl and Bitcoin Bowl, respectively.
Friday, August 21 will feature the Countdown to Kickoff Luncheon at CFE Arena, at 11 a.m., as well as an open practice from 3:20-5:30 p.m. and the UCF FanFest at 6 p.m., according to UCF Athletics. Practice for UCF’s preseason will be held on Wednesday, August 5.
The Knights kick off the season with a home game against FIU on September 3, at 6 p.m., and will begin league play on October 3 when they face Tulane at Yulman Stadium.
