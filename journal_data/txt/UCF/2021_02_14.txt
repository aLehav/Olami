UCF has offered the head coaching position to former Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn, sources confirmed to 247Sports’ Jason Beede and the Orlando Sentinel Sunday night.
Malzahn spent the past eight seasons as coach at Auburn, where he led the Tigers to a 68-35 overall record and a 39-27 mark in the Southeastern Conference. 
He was fired on Dec. 13, 2020, following a 6-4 campaign and was paid a $21.45 million buyout, per reports.

It’s unclear whether Malzahn will accept the UCF offer, the Sentinel reports. 
Malzahn was linked to the job as soon as UCF hired athletics director Terry Mohajir, who worked with Malzahn at Arkansas State. 
It is not yet known whether Malzahn will accept the position, and sources tell CBS Sports that UCF hopes to announce its next football coach in the next 24 hours.
UCF Director of Athletics Terry Mohajir previously hired Malzahn at Arkansas State.
In 2012, Mohajir was named ASU’s new athletic director and his first hire was Malzahn as head coach, the Arkansas Times reports.
