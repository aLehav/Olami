A jury decided UCF Athletics Association Inc. was negligent in how it handled Ereck Plancher’s situation and awarded his parents $10 million in compensatory damages but did not award any punitive damages. UCF officials announced plans to appeal immediately following the verdict.
Grant Heston, a UCF spokesman, released this statement: “We’re confident that a fair and just review review will support our position. UCF’s coaches and trainers responded quickly and appropriately as soon as Ereck was in distress. It is clear that the UCF Athletics Association is part of the University.”
UCF Athletics Association Inc. has proposed several possible remedies in its appeal including a retrial.
