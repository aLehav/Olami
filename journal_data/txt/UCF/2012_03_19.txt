Knightnews.com stopped by the Knight Library St.Patty’s Day festivities to see how the party turned out, and it was a huge success.
Lines of people stretched all around the block party fence, waiting to get a chance to go into one of the craziest block parties in Orlando. Partygoers enjoyed Irish Car Bombs, Green Beer, and Guinness Drinks all day and into the night. Everyone dressed to theme, with one person donning nothing but green apron, and anotherwho dyed their hair completely green!
Overall, the event turnout was huge, and even inside Knight Library/Dungeon it was packed to the brim. Knightnews.com put together a video that shows the night in a nutshell:
