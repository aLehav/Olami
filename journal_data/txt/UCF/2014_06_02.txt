UCF earned five research grants this past week worth nearly $2 million from the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program.
The awards, which totaled $39.9 million, will help 149 universities and placed UCF in the top three university award recipients in the nation. The goal of the awards is to help these universities purchase state-of-the-art equipment to benefit science education.
“Our strategy of focusing on research that stimulates the local and state economies has served us very well in competing for these federal awards,”  MJ Soileau, vice president for research and commercialization at UCF said in a UCF news release. “Our faculty have consistently shown that they can compete with the best and the equipment purchased with these awards will position them even better for future funding. This is particularly important since most contracts and grants are for specific work to be done and have little or no money for purchase of major capital equipment.”
UCF, University of Illinois and Rutgers were the only universities to receive five awards.
