Here are Christopher Boley’s top Netflix recommendations of the week:
Drive (2011)
Despite the way it was advertised, Drive is much more than a run of the mill Transporter-esque action movie. Starring Ryan Gosling, it follows the story of a Hollywood stunt driver by day, getaway driver for criminals by night, who starts a relationship with his neighbor and sets him on a collision course with the mob. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Pusher trilogy), it is a beautifully shot, intense drama that embraces the idea “less is more”.
Good Will Hunting (1997)
Written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, Good Will Hunting follows the story of a young genius janitor at MIT who receives help and guidance on life from a psychologist. Robin Williams, who plays the psychologist, gives my favorite performance of his, and Matt Damon stands out in the lead role. It’s a very emotional and uplifting movie, with lots of comedy and drama throughout. The script is amazing, and all the great performances compliment it. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.
Network (1976)
For a movie that was made thirty seven years ago, it has never been more relevant than today. Following the exploits of a TV anchors rants criticizing the media, it tackles issues surrounding news and media production, specifically the use of stories for ratings. It’s a movie that not only has a very interesting story, but one that will connect with audiences and make us all ask ourselves if we actually see integrity in the news.
Goon (2011)
With the NHL season back, I’m recommending a good Hockey movie this week. Starring Sean William Scott, if follows the story of a bouncer who is recruited by a minor league hockey team, specifically for his fighting skills. While the movie revolves around hockey with great sport scenes, the movie is an emotional character study with a lot of heart. It is funny, emotional, and has great fight scenes. Hockey fans and movie watchers will enjoy.
