More than three years after UCF football player Ereck Plancher died following a workout, his parents’ lawyer said the $10 million verdict awarded by the jury brought “justice” for the family. 
The jury did not award punitive damages to the Plancher family. KnightNews.com legal analyst Lisa Figueroa explained how that means the jury didn’t believe the UCF football program committed egregious or outrageous negligence. 
But a CBS Sports blogger named Dennis Dodd disagrees with Heston. He has already called for the firing of UCF Athletic Director Keith Tribble and O’Leary in the wake of the verdict.
