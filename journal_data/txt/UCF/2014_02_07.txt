A UCF student’s ex-boyfriend is being accused of posting revenge porn of his ex-girlfriend on the internet, according to WFTV.
Sean Shahid, 20 Campus police told WFTV that 20-year-old Sean Shahid posted sexually explicit photos and videos on social media sites of his ex-girlfriend as retaliation for talking to police about another case he might be involved with.
UCFPD arrested Shahid on Jan. 29 on charges of stalking and tampering with a witness, according to the Orange County Jail’s inmate database. 
Posting so-called “revenge porn” isn’t a crime in Florida, authorities told WFTV. Shahid is not charged related to posting the explicit photos and videos.
A UCF spokesperson emailed a KnightNews.com reporter saying Shahid is not a UCF student, disputing WFTV’s report that Shahid is a current UCF student. It’s still unclear whether he is a former UCF student.
