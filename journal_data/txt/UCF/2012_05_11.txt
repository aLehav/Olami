Wealthy Polo mogul John Goodman, who was recently convicted by a jury of killing recent UCF grad Scott Wilson in a DUI crash, received his sentence Friday. 
A Palm Beach County Circuit Judge sentenced Goodman to 16 years in prison, fined him $10,000 and took away his driver’s license.
Goodman in court during sentencing; awaits appeal
KnightNews.com has been following the case that has outraged UCF students since Wilson’s death in 2010, but the case drew much more national attention when Goodman adopted his girlfriend in a controversial estate planning move. 
During the sentencing, the judge admitted that an appeals court will review the case and decide whether he handled the case appropriately. 
Goodman’s attorney, Roy Black, believes his client didn’t get a fair shake. 
“It is our belief that multiple errors were committed during and before the trial that, in effect, denied our client’s ability to get a fair trial,” Black said in a statement to KnightNews.com following the verdict.
“We intend to file an appeal so that our client can receive the just and fair proceeding to which he is entitled by law.”
Goodman was convicted after prosecutors alleged he was drunk at the time he left Wilson to die in a canal after his Bentley hit Wilson’s Hyundai in South Florida. 
KnightNews.com will continue following the appeal process and update you if Goodman’s sentence changes.
