Dr. Jonathon Matusitz, a professor at the Nicholson School of Communication is being targeting after a Youtube video entitled “University of Central Florida Professor Spews Anti-Islam Hate” made its way around the web.
The video prompted the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-FL), along with other community organizations to call on UCF to review the information that Dr. Matusitz is teaching to his students.
CAIR-FL also claims that Dr. Matustiz is a membership director for an anti-Muslim hate group ACT! that claims that Germany will be an Islamic Republic by 2050.
“It’s preposterous,” Matustiz said in an interview with Local 6. “They’ve never been in my classroom. I have very good student evaluations.”
Check out the full video below of Dr.Matustiz’s lecture.
