A motion UCF lawyers made to disqualify Circuit Court Judge Robert Evans from presiding over the Ereck Plancher wrongful death lawsuit was “denied,” according to court records posted online.

The Orange County Clerk of Court website shows an order was entered Tuesday, June 7 which stated the following: “Order ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR DISQUALIFICATION- denied.”
UCF Assistant Vice President Grant Heston issued a statement to KnightNews.com after breaking this major development in the case. 
“The motion was well founded concerning the importance of this issue and we respectfully disagree with Judge Evans’ ruling,” Heston said. “However, the court has ruled and we will be ready for trial.” 
The motion to disqualify was reportedly raised by UCF because of a comment made by the judge about UCF Coach George O’Leary not being “the sharpest knife in the drawer” regarding federal privacy laws on notifying parents.  
The same day the judge made the remarks, on May 27, 2011, he apologized for his choice of words and clarified what he meant.
