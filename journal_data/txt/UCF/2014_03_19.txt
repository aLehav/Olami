Quarterwear & Knight-Thon, the University of Central Florida’s official student philanthropy, are proud to announce the release of the first Limited-Edition Dance Marathon socks benefiting Greater Orlando Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.
Released in a limited batch of 300, these socks will be sold online for $25 each.
Half of the proceeds  go directly “to support research and training, purchase equipment, and pay for uncompensated care at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital and Arnold Palmer Medical Center,” as stated by Quarterwear.
The colorful socks bearing “FTK”, which stands for “For The Kids”,  will be available until March 28th at 11:59pm.
You can purchase a pair of these socks here.
Both the founders of Quarterwear, an online retailer, and Rock ‘Em Apparel, the company manufacturing these socks, are UCF Alumni.
“It’s truly an honor to be able to raise funds for the 2014 Knight-Thon campaign and Greater Orlando Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals,” says Funlola Falade, Founder & CEO of Quarterwear. “I look forward to seeing miracles happen in the lives of children across the Greater Orlando region.”
“Charities and the community has been a staple of Rock ‘Em Apparel’s culture since our inception,” says Rob Starkman, Founder & CEO of Rock ‘Em Apparel. “To work with a fellow UCF Knight, Funlola Falade, and his company Quarterwear, especially for a worthy cause, was an honor and a pleasure.”
