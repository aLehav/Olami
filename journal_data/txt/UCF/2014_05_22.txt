The UCF Board of Trustees met on Thursday and UCF students will not see an increase in tuition this fall.
Tuition will remain the same price as 2013-2014, in total at $149.27 per credit hour for base and differential tuition combined or $4,500 for an academic year of 30 credit hours. Graduate tuition would also remain the same at $288.16 per credit hour.
Earlier this year, lawmakers approved a bill to set a limit on how much universities can increase tuition. The bill prevents most Florida universities from seeking an increase in differential tuition, the second type of tuition students are charged.
It will be the first time in multiple years that UCF students have not seen a tuition increase.
