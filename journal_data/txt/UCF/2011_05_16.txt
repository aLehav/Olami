With the Casey Anthony trial selecting the jury in Pinellas County, it’s only a matter of time before the trial shifts back to downtown Orlando, bringing a swarm of media and national attention.
A two story media staging area is already being constructed in the lot across from the Orange County Courthouse, along with many other staging areas in the downtown area.
In anticipation of the media circus, a movement of “Flash Reporting” has sprung up on online, where instead of covering the trial, citizen journalists plan to cover the ensuing chaos the trial brings from the view of an Orlando resident.
The Facebook page for the group seen here says in the pages description: “It is news the way we see it, across the street, in the dirt parking lot and around downtown.”
The page also says that the flash reporters will judge the media reporting the trial. “We are going to be interviewing those covering the trial, because we don’t really care about the trial just those who need to report the trial. Whose working hard and whose hardly working, what they wear, whose had the worse hair or bad hair day, what are they eating in those trailers they have parked on the street,” the group’s Facebook page states.
