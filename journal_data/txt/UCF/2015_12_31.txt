Those who will be drinking tonight can now celebrate safely by planning ahead.
Many of those who are celebrating and drinking already have a plan to get home safely, but some don’t.
Triple A will be towing vehicles for free to save those from driving drunk. It does not matter if you are a member of AAA or not. 
AAA will tow your vehicle and give the driver a free ride home as long as it is within 10 miles. The service is offered tonight and throughout tomorrow on New Year’s Day.
Users in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee can call (855) 2-TOW-2-GO or (855) 286-9246 to receive the free tow.
