Recently, rumor has been floating around that UCF may start its season off in Ireland in 2014 by taking on Penn State.
The Orlando Sentinel reported that four UCF representatives returned from a four-day trip to Ireland to discuss the possbility of making the game a reality. Although nothing is official, it looks clear that both schools are working towards making the game happen in 2014. Penn State head coach Bill O’Brien confirmed that the Nittany Lions are “really close” to finalizing the trip to Ireland.
Since Penn State is banned from post-season play for the next three seasons, adding a trip to Ireland could give a “bowl-like” experience for fans willing to make the trip overseas.
“I hope it happens. It’d be a great experience for our program, great experience for the university and a great experience for the fan base. It should be great game,” UCF head coach George O’Leary told the Orlando Sentinel.
Penn State and UCF will face off this upcoming season at Beaver Stadium on Sept.14.
