UCF Athletic Director Danny White declared the Knights national champions after having an undefeated season and Peach Bowl victory over Auburn New Year’s Day.
Coaching legend Bobby Bowden backed Frost and the Knights perfect season and turnaround from the 2015 0-12 year. Bowden spoke with Omaha The World-Herald on Friday, stating UCF did deserve the national title.
“I’ll be honest with you, they deserve [the national title], in my opinion,” the retired coach said in an interview with The World-Herald.
“But they won’t win it because they’re not in the Power Five, you know? But you take Auburn in November, probably the hottest team in the country, Auburn beat No. 1 and No. 2, then Central Florida beats them. And so I think they got a right to claim it. But the NCAA won’t recognize it.”
Bowden’s record at Florida State included 377 wins, averaging about 74% over his career. The 88-year-old commented on the growth of football in the state of Florida. It’s safe to say UCF makes its case as the best in the sunshine state.
“I can’t believe how much it has grown,” Bowden said.. “When I came here in 1976, there were three of us playing D-1 ball: Florida, Florida State and Miami. Now there’s seven of us and it has really grown.”
“And it’s amazing that Central Florida was better than anybody. It’s just amazing.”

The Virginia newspaper that crowned the UCF Knights the 2017 National Champions of college football has teamed with Knight News to produce a special national championship commemorative edition newspaper. 
The Prince George Journal of Virginia is featuring the work of Knight News student journalists in its special edition. 
Prince George Journal Publisher Chad Harrison discussed the partnership with Knight News on the Open Mike radio show on 96.9 The Game. 
“They took some great photos, did some great stories,” Harrison said of the Knight News students covering the Peach Bowl on the Open Mike show. 
“We’ve partnered with them, and using their material and their stories — and a little bit of ingenuity from ourselves — we put this thing together, this championship edition, to honor the team, working with the student newspaper at UCF,” Harrison said. “It’s been a great team effort and it’s really a great publication.” 
Knight News is an online newspaper, so it is a rare treat for UCF students to see their student journalists’ work in print.
