Students will once again be able to enjoy the golden arches close to campus. 
The McDonalds across the street from UCF main campus on the corner of Alafaya and Strategy Boulevard is set to open on August 4, according to Della Worley, the Marketing Supervisor of McDonalds.
The restaurant will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including the lobby inside. 
McDonalds will hold their first event at the renovated location August 19 from midnight to 5 a.m. for “McRollback Knight”. The store will be offering $1 Big Macs, $1 Quarter Cheese,  75 cent 6-piece nuggets and 50 cent small fries during that time.
Also, the first 100 customers on “McRollback Knight” will receive a free Big Mac once a week for a year. 
The official grand opening event will be held on Saturday, August 23 from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. There will be photo opportunities with Knightro, a DJ, prize wheel, bean bag toss and photo booth. McDonalds will have giveaways going on during that time as well, with opportunities to win UCF athletic tickets, theme park tickets and UCF merchandise. 



Defending American Athletic Conference champions UCF did not get selected to be the favorites in the AAC this upcoming football season.
The Cincinnati Bearcats were picked to finish first in the AAC preseason poll, receiving 17 of the 30 first place votes. The Bearcats went 9-4 last season under head coach Tommy Tuberville and are returning 16 starters.
The Knights, who are returning 17 starters, received seven of the first place votes, but also must replace a 1,000 yard rusher in Storm Johnson and star quarterback Blake Bortles.
Houston was picked third with six first place votes, followed by East Carolina, SMU, USF, Memphis, and Temple. UCONN and Tulane were tied with the least amount of votes.
