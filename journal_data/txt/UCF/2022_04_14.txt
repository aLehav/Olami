UCF head coach Gus Malzahn and staff just got one step closer towards landing a big time weapon for the future.
2023 3-star tight end Jayvontay Conner announced on Thursday that he has included UCF in his final six schools.
The other five named schools were Florida State, Maryland, Virginia Tech, Mississippi State, and South Carolina.
Conner played his junior year at Opelika High School in Alabama, where he caught 24 passes for 405 yards and six touchdowns, per Noles 247.
Conner is currently ranked the No. 51 tight end in the nation and the No. 26 prospect in North Carolina for the 2023 class by 247Sports.
Throughout his high school career, the 3-star has accumulated 42 offers from schools including Cincinnati, Louisville, Miami, Memphis, Minnesota, and many other notable programs.
If the Knights are able to seal the deal, they would be gifted a tight end who would bring a versatile skillset to Malzahn’s offense.
Though listed as a tight end, Conner’s length and speed allow him to occasionally line up at the slot, or even out wide.
In addition, the 3-star put his run blocking ability on full display in his junior year tape by absolutely flattening defenders.
With a commitment, Conner would join a UCF tight end room that consists of redshirt senior Alec Holler, 2022 recruit Grant Stevens, and Florida transfer Kenmore Gamble.
The future of UCF football is looking brighter by the day, Knight Nation.
