Sources are telling KnightNews.com that the UCF student conduct board has recommended that the Sigma Chi fraternity be suspended from campus until 2016. The board also recommended Alpha Epsilon Pi be suspended for a year, sources say.
During closed hearings, a UCF conduct board first decides whether the organization is in-violation or not in-violation. The conduct board then recommends a punishment to UCF if it finds that the organization is in-violation.
We are currently awaiting an official word from UCF.
