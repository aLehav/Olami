The next time you’re driving back to UCF after a night out in downtown Orlando, be prepared for a major change to how you get back to UCF.
When you’re headed east on the 408 from downtown, you’ll now need to exit to the right on the 417 to head north to University Blvd.
Changes to 408/417 Interchange
Prior to the change, you had to exit on the left to head north on the 417. The change has caused confusion for some drivers since it went into effect over the weekend. 
The changes were made to improve the traffic flow on the 408 with new construction.
