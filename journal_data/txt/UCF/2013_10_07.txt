The Knights may very well be 3-2 right now if it wasn’t for the stellar play of UCF linebacker Terrance Plummer in Saturday’s victory against the Memphis Tigers.
Plummer was named the American Athletic Conference defensive player of the week for the second time this season on Monday. The junior linebacker had five tackles, two interceptions, his first career sack and two pass break-ups in UCF’s 24-17 victory at Memphis.
After UCF had back-to-back touchdowns in a span of nine seconds, the Tigers came charging back moving the ball all the way to the UCF 6-yard line with less than 45 seconds to play. Memphis running back Brandon Hayes tossed a pass into the endzone that was tipped by UCF safety Clayton Geathers and was subsequently intercepted by Plummer, sealing the Knight’s victory.
Plummer is currently leading the Knights in tackles this season, with 47 overall including five tackles for losses.
The Knights will suit up again and travel to Louisville on October 18 to take on the no.8 ranked Louisville Cardinals.
