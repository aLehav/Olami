Did you know that December 6th was Chrismakkuh? Don’t believe us? Just ask the Kappa Sigma fraternity.

For about 6 years now, Kappa Sigma has been hosting this holiday gathering for the Boys and Girls Club of America. Each year they team up with other sororities and fraternities to bring holiday cheer to kids and families that need it most. This year, Kappa Sigma invited the sorority Alpha Delta Pi and the fraternity Phi Beta Sigma to host the event with them.
Sisters from Alpha Delta Pi were paired with brothers from Kappa Sigma and were assigned a “buddy” from the Boys and Girls Club of America for the day. The pairs bought special gifts off of their buddy’s wish list and presented them at the end of the day. This amazing philanthropy event provides a fun and festive holiday for families that cannot afford to provide these children with the presents that they need or want.
But even before the gift giving began, the kids were thoroughly entertained. At the Kappa Sigma house there were attractions and games for all ages.
The families and their Greek-buddies could play in the bounce house, the bounce obstacle course, dunk a Kappa Sigma brother in the dunk tank, play badminton, a ring toss, or many people’s favorite: apple baseball. It was an extremely successful day for the organizations that participated and for the Boys and Girls Club of America. And, it was a very merry kick-start to the holiday season.
