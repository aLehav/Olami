UCF police are investigating reports of a man who exposed himself on campus Thursday, which is the third incident in less than a week. Several witnesses reported the indecent exposure near the intramural fields by the Recreation and Wellness Center at 5:15 p.m., UCF Police reported.
The suspect reportedly fled towards Research Park in a dark gray sedan with tinted windows. He is described as a white, heavy-set man, in his late 20s to mid-30s, wearing a white shirt, a light blue jacket and long dark pants, investigators said.
“The fact that we’ve had three reports of this nature in less than a week is highly unusual,” UCF Police Chief Carl Metzger said.
Authorities are still investigating the Tuesday morning incident, in which a man reportedly committed a sex act in front of two women near Garage E, but do not believe it involves the same suspect as this one, UCF Police said.
UCFPD has also concluded the investigation of the Sunday morning groping incident, as the woman who reported being groped is not cooperating with police, UCF Police reported.
“While UCFPD works diligently and around the clock to investigate these cases and protect our campus, I ask for your heightened vigilance. If you see something, say something-call police immediately,” Metzger said.
Anyone with information is asked to call UCFPD at 407-823-5555.
