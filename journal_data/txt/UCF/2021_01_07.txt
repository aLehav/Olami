Following the violent storming of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Florida’s House and Senate have filed identical bills to combat violence, disorder and looting in Florida.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis first proposed the legislation in September 2020.
“While as Americans we all have a right to peacefully assemble, violence or rioting of any kind is not acceptable and will not be tolerated in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said in a news release.
DeSantis proposed legislation to stop violent assemblies, combat rioting and protect law enforcement in 2020 and said in light of Wednesday’s events at the U.S. Capitol, Florida has no time to waste to uphold public safety. 
“I look forward to working with House Speaker Sprowls and Senate President Simpson to swiftly pass this bill during the upcoming Legislative Session so that we may protect the rule of law in our great state,” he said.
Today, Sen. Burgess filed SB 484. “This legislation makes it clear that here in Florida criminals who seek to thwart peaceful protests by willfully inciting violence, attacking law enforcement and destroying public or private property will be held accountable.” – @DannyBurgessFL
