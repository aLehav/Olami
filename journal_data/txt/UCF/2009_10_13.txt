UCF student Nathan B. Schaller stands accused of taking pictures of his penis and pleasuring himself over a Web cam while wearing a UCF T-shirt — all to try and lure what he thought was a 14-year-old girl into “kinky sex,” according to reports.
It turns out, the person on the other end of the computer wasn’t a young girl, but an undercover agent instead.
KnightNews.com has confirmed Schaller, 23, was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail Monday on two charges of cruelty toward a child by transmitting harmful information to a minor, and one charge of using a computer to seduce, solicit, or lure a child.
The Winter Haven native is being held on $60,000 bond.
During the chats, Schaller reportedly said he wanted to make sure he wasn’t being set up or anything, like on To Catch A Predator.
KnightNews.com is working to gather more information on this developing story, and we hope to have an update by Wednesday.
