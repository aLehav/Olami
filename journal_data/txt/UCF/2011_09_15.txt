It’s such a big deal, FIU has produced a video taunting the UCF Knights, and even poking fun at two things UCF holds sacred: El Corral and KnightNews.com music videos.

So, what do you think? 
Should KnightNews.com strike back with a video of our own tomorrow? 
Is it the start of a new in-state rivalry? Is USF missing out on playing UCF and FIU ready to step up and take its place? 
By the way, much like UCF did when stomping Boston College of the ACC, FIU just beat a BCS conference opponent — Louisville of the Big East. Yes, the conference where USF plays. (That “geographically-challenged” school on the west coast of Florida that’s too scared to play UCF anymore.)
Comment below or send us an email letting us know your ideas for a possible UCF strikes back video to news@knightnews.com. 



UPDATE: See the video from night 2 of UCF fraternity rush:
