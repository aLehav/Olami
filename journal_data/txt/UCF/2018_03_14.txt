Common walkways in and out of the Student Union will be closed to make way for construction of the new food court.
UCF Vice President of Communications Briant Coleman sent an email to students over Spring Break detailing the change in exits.
The South exit leading to the library remains open as does the exits leading from either side of the Pegasus Ballroom hallway and the Qdoba doorway. The North exit will remain closed until project completion in Fall 2018.
“The Student Union is currently undergoing a $24 million renovation to provide new and exciting options for students,” Coleman said in the email. “Along with a new food court offering Panda Express, Which Wich Superior Sandwiches, Huey Magoos, Steak N’ Shake, and Q’Doba, the renovation will also provide more than 350 new seats in a first- and second-floor lounge, a new Student Government Association suite, and 15,000 square feet of new space.”
The food court is scheduled to open for the new academic year in Fall 2018 and the remainder of construction is planned to be completed the following year in Fall 2019.
