The Brothers of Tau Kappa Epsilon at the University of Central Florida are holding “Spring TKE Over” at Knights Library March 28. 
This event is the first of its kind for TKE and the brothers are very excited about what they have put together. This being TKE’s first spring party, the brothers have been working around the clock to make this event a success.
“I worked hard with my committee to establish this event. It’s hard putting together a first year party but we’re doing the best we can,” TKE Vice President Connor Murchie said.
When asked why the brothers of TKE decided to put this all together, they explained that they wanted the Greek community and non-Greek affiliated students to be able to come together and just have fun.
“We are doing this because why not. Too many fraternities host events where they just try and target sorority girls. TKE wants to be the unifier of Greek life and UCF. We want to bring all the fraternities all the sororities and all the non-Greek affiliated students to an event where they can dress up and go out with friends,” Murchie said.
TKE social media chairman, Nick Bettelli, echoed Murchies enthusiasm about the event saying that “the real purpose of this party is to show the positive side of Greek organizations by creating a facilitated social environment to have a good time.”
Cover for Spring TKE Over is $5 for guys and free for girls. Spring TKE over’s drink specials are $2 drinks and drafts. Doors will open at 9 p.m.
