Scoop Bar, Grill and Lounge will celebrate its official Grand Re-Opening Monday night to kick off Summer B at UCF.
Those who come back for the first time tonight better be ready for big changes, including some of the area’s cleanest bathrooms — with doors.
There will also be some fancy 60 inch TVs, new booths, new bars, a new kitchen and more. Food will be served more often, thanks to the upgrades.
KnightNews.com attended last Wednesday’s soft opening of the new Scoop, and the changes and atmosphere was a big hit with the crowd.
Bar promoters promise tonight’s grand re-opening with “the sexiest staff in Orlando” will also be well worth your time — and cover– with free drinks until midnight and 5 free wings with a promotion ticket.
Cover is $5 for girls, and $7 for guys.
Scoop is located at Colonial and Alafaya:
