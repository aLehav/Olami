University of Central Florida President John C. Hitt announced that it is the right time for him to step down as president of the university Tuesday morning.
In an email sent to students titled “The Right Time,” Hitt announced his plans to step down as the president of the university effective June 30, 2018.
“Since 1992, Martha and I have been honored to work alongside many exceptional people. Being at UCF has been one of the greatest joys of our lives,” Hitt said.
The email explains that UCF Board of Trustees Chairman Marcos Marchena will convene a search committee to look Hitts replacement.
“I make this decision in good health and of my choosing,” Hitt said. “The time is right for this decision because I’ve never felt better about UCF.”
