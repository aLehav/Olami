The week UCF students have waited for all semester has finally arrived — Spring Break.
But with turmoil in the Middle East affecting the price of crude oil, it’s getting to be expensive to fill up your tank and take the usual Spring Break road trip to Daytona or the Panhandle.
According to GasBuddy.com, the average price of a gallon of regular is $3.48 but Florida is slightly above that average coming in at $3.54 a gallon.

According to a CBS News report, the Obama administration is considering opening up reserves. “It’s an option that on the table,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said.
The same report also adds that since the Libyan revolt gas prices have gone up an average of 38 cents.
The sudden spike in gas prices doesn’t look to be slowing down anytime soon. 
Jessica Brady, a spokeswoman for AAA Auto Club South told the Palm Beach Post, “We could see $4 sooner than later.”
Brady also predicted that gas prices will reach $4 by July.
With no end to the rise of oil prices in sight, students are left to add on the price of gas before going on their spring break trips and summer vacations.
