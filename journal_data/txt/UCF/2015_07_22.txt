The NBA said Wednesday that the Orlando Magic and Toronto Raptors will play a regular season game in London on January 14, 2016.
It will be the sixth league game played at the O2 Arena in the British capital. Before 2011, games in London were only exhibitions, according to ESPN.
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement, “We look forward to returning to London next season…This underscores our commitment to growing basketball in the region and to bringing more regular-season basketball to our fans in the UK.”
Orlando Magic head coach Scott Skiles competed in two preseason games in London in as a player of the Magic in 1993, according to ESPN.
“I remember playing in London with the Magic in 1993,” Skiles said, “and I am sure our current players will relish this unique opportunity.”
Skiles was named as the Orlando Magic head coach on May 29 of this year.
