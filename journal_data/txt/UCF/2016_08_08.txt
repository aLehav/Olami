Many UCF students returning to campus this fall won’t be able to enjoy their favorite pizza hangout spot anymore. 
Pie Five Pizza recently closed down and posted a note on the front door saying, “We’d like to thank the East Orlando/UCF Community for your support…”
The pizza shop was located at 11325 University Blvd and was open for a duration of 18 months. 
Blaze Pizza located at 4100 N Alafaya Trail now remains as the only create your own style pizzaria located in the immediate area of UCF.
