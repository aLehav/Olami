Former UCF students and X-Factor winners Alex and Sierra will return to the campus they started at on August 31 for the 2014 Pegasus Palooza concert along with popular pop duo Karmin.
The concert, hosted by the Campus Activity Board, will be free for UCF students with a valid ID at the door and $20 general admission for others.
After Alex and Sierra won the FOX television reality show X Factor, the duo reached #1 on iTunes with their covers of A Great Big World’s ‘Say Something’ and Sara Bareilles’ ‘Gravity’. They signed a $1 million recording contract and signed with Columbia Records shortly after winning the show.
Karmin is a pop duo consisting of Amy Heidemann and Nick Noonan, known for their hit “Brokenhearted” which reached the top 20 in the United States. 
Pegasus Palooza is UCF’s official welcome week, consisting of social, academic and service activities to help students become acquainted to campus. In 2013, CAB brought Capital Cities & Stepdad to perform at UCF for Pegasus Palooza.
