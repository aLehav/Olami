Tropical Storm Julia left 6 million Floridians, among others, under a flash flood watch early Wednesday morning.
A tropical storm warning was placed from Fernandina Beach, FL, to Altamaha Sound, GA, with the possibility of up to 10 inches of rainfall  occurring in the areas receiving the greatest impact. The tropical cyclone now has moved on to parts of Georgia and South Carolina as the first-ever tropical cyclone to be named over Florida, according to NBC News.
“We know that heavy rainfall is expected across Northeastern Florida between Daytona Beach and the Florida-Georgia border for the next several days,” Florida Governor Rick Scott said.
On September 2, Hurricane Hermine made landfall over the panhandle of the Sunshine State. Scott continues to urge residents of safety during natural disasters including wind, flooding, and safety following an affected area.
