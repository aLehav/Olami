Former UCF standout running back Otis Anderson has just elevated his football career to the professional level, as the four-year Knight signed a three-year deal with the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams on Wednesday.
Anderson and the Rams agreed to a three-year, 2.45 million-dollar contract that will last through the 2023-24 NFL season, where he is set to become a restricted free agent.
The former Knight will have some competition going into the season, entering a Los Angeles running back room that now consists of six total backs.
While at UCF, Anderson became one of the Knights’ most successful rushers of all time. The four-year back averaged 6.1 yards-per-carry during his collegiate career, which ranks second all-time in program history.  In addition, Anderson’s 2,182 career rushing yards ranks ninth all-time in UCF history.
Anderson saw much of his success during his junior season, where he was the Knights’ best all-purpose threat and leading rusher with his 726 yards on a team-high of 113 attempts.  
The former Knight excelled on the special teams unit, returning punts.  Anderson had an average of 13.2 yards per return his junior season, which led the AAC and ranked sixth nationally.
These feats earned him the honor of being named the First Team All-AAC punt returner by Pro Football Focus, as well as an honorable mention selection on the All-American Athletic Conference team. 
Anderson will get the opportunity to make his case for a spot on the Rams’ 53-man roster on Aug. 14, when the Rams host the Chargers for their first game of the 2021 NFL preseason.
