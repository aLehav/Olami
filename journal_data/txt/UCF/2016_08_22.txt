On August 31, the University of Central Florida will host a celebration and grand opening of its newest building on Memory Mall.
The Global UCF building serves as the “biggest symbol of UCF’s continuing commitment to internationalization, houses Global UCF students and programs, UCF Abroad, the English Language Institute, and all international immigration and advising services,” the university has stated.
The event runs from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. at 4356 Scorpius St., across from the Fairwinds Alumni Center. Refreshments and building tours will be offered as part of the grand opening event.

Over three-stories and 54,000-square-feet, a modernistic design of 22 classrooms and meeting rooms are featured throughout the building. On the first floor, large glass windows and doors fit into the design and promote an open space for students who walk through and make the most of what the building and program have to offer.
Knight News will be at the grand opening ceremony to provide coverage of this ceremony.



John Euliano and University of Central Florida Athletics have announced a gift commitment of $1.5 million to a stadium project that will ‘transform Knights baseball.’
Over a Facebook live stream Monday afternoon, John Euliano, UCF Vice President and Director of Athletics Danny White, along with UCF Baseball head coach Greg Lovelady, made their announcement. The project expects a post-2017 start date, dependent on approval from the UCF President and Board of Trustees, who will likely approve the project unanimously.

“Baseball has always been a passion of mine,” said Euliano. “UCF is world-class academically, and I want to see the university reach the same level of success in athletics. Dealing with failure, making adjustments, leadership and teamwork are just a few.”
“In order to get there, we need first-class facilities for our student-athletes. The game of baseball provides so many life lessons that can help these men in their life after the game ends for them.”
A resident of Winter Springs and longtime baseball fan, Euliano’s daughter currently attends UCF and his son is an alumni of the university.
“I have such an amazing opportunity to help the UCF Baseball team achieve its goals by funding an upgraded baseball facility, and I’m excited to partner with them in this endeavor. We are going to build a championship program, and I’m proud to be a small part of it.” continued Euliano.
A cost of $3 million dollars will bring a new home plate tower, 300-seat premium club section with outdoor seating and indoor amenities, an air-conditioned lounge, food and beverage service, private restrooms, and a dedicated entrance to the area.
Baseball head coach Greg Lovelady affirmed Euliano’s commitment to upgrading player and fan experience.
“When the young men we’re recruiting see the renderings, they’re going to be even more excited to come play baseball at UCF,” Lovelady said. “Great facilities, great support, and great fans all played a part in my desire to coach at UCF. With this one amazing gesture, John Euliano just raised the level of all those areas. I can’t wait to see John Euliano Park open in the very near future.”
Additional charitable funds will be sought by the Golden Knights Foundation to fund the remainder of the project’s estimated cost. Five-year pledge committments will start at $1,000 per season ticket in the new premium club section. UCF Athletics offers a membership reservation for fans available at 407.823.1000.
“This is a big-time, game-changing gift for us,” UCF Vice President and Director of Athletics Danny White said. “It is one of the largest individual gift commitments in the history of our athletic department. When John Euliano Park opens, we’ll have a state-of-the-art facility for our baseball program that will provide great benefits to our student-athletes, our coaches, and our fans. We can’t thank John and his family enough.”
The opening date of John Euliano Park would be prior to the 2018 season on this timeline.
 



Former University of Central Florida Football Head Coach George O’Leary celebrated his 70th birthday this past week, and for the first time in nearly 50 years, was able to do it at home.
When George’s wife Sharon asked him how he wanted to commemorate his birthday, George chuckled and said “Come up with a way to spend the next 48 years not being home on my birthday,” according to the Orlando Sentinel.
O’Leary has been spent nearly 50 years coaching up and down the gridiron sidelines on all levels including professional, and during those years, rarely took any time to celebrate his birthdays.
According to the Sentinel, O’Leary is spending time relaxing and going back and forth between his Palm Coast house and his lake house in Georgia. He even purchased some jet skis. 
“I’m really enjoying retirement,” O’Leary told the Sentinel. “It’s nice getting up in the morning and not having to worry about 200 other people. I enjoy bouncing around on the jet skis and I really like taking the dogs out in the boat. Nobody bothers me or gets near me because the dogs start barking like crazy!”
O’Leary has flown under the radar since stepping down as UCF’s head coach last October. The original plan was for O’Leary to announce his retirement at the end of the season, but that changed after the losses started to add up and UCF suffered a 59-10 defeat to Houston during its homecoming game.
“I didn’t want to be a lame-duck coach,” O’Leary told the Sentinel. “You never want the kids to know you’re leaving because then you’re not in charge. And I also believe it hurts recruiting. But, finally, I just told president Hitt, ‘If we’re going to make an announcement that I’m retiring at the end of the year, let me just make it easy on you: I’ll just retire right now — effective immediately.’
“You know me,” O’Leary said, according to the Sentinel. “I’m going to do things the way I’ve always done them — my way. I wish it had ended better, but I’m proud of what we accomplished at UCF. The program is a helluva lot better now than when we got there.”
Despite how things were handled, O’Leary says he’ll always root for UCF.
“I’ll always be a UCF guy; I want UCF to win,” O’Leary said. “That’s never going to change.”



Thousands of students made their way from convocation at CFE Arena to Memory Mall and the Student Union for Welcoming Knight 2016. These students took part in the Class of 2020 Welcoming Knight class photo along with Knightro and also had a chance to see dozens of university clubs, sports teams, and other organizations on display.
Welcoming Knight kicks off a full week of UCF events known as Pegasus Palooza. Here are some photos that captured the first weekend these freshmen spent at the University of Central Florida:
