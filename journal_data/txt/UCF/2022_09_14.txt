After multiple catalytic converter thefts earlier this year, the UCF Police Department is offering free forensic marking for converters on vehicles belonging to UCF students and new ProtechDNA kit next week. 
With a recent uptick in catalytic converter thefts around the nation, UCFPD wants to ensure students have a way of claiming their property if they are a victim of theft. A free ProTechDNA kit will be available to students at next week's event. Details: https://t.co/k7WJpZLmhT pic.twitter.com/GO8hiF1isS
UCFPD has partnered with ProtechDNA to provide high-tech labels that can be placed directly on items such as phones, bikes and catalytic converters 
According to the UCFPD these high-tech labels will have: 
“Microscopic dots embedded into adhesive, and each dot is etched with a PIN number unique to the property owner. If a label is removed, the adhesive still remains on the property, allowing law enforcement to easily return the item to its owner if it is recovered after being lost or stolen.” 
The UCFPD says that while catalytic converters are hard to trace back to their rightful owners, the new technology provided by ProtechDNA can have stolen property easily returned after being recovered. 
After Sponsoring with State Farm, a free ProtechDNA package will be offered to the first 100 UCF students attending the catalytic marking event on Thursday Sept. 22 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Garage A on UCF’s main campus. 
UCF faculty and staff who attend the event can purchase the package for $15.  
Students who aren’t able to attend next week’s event can still request a free ProtechDNA  kit on their website here.
