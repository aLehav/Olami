UCF Track and Field star Aurieyall Scott took home a gold medal on Monday at the World University Games — Team USA’s first gold medal of the meet and UCF’s first medalist at the World University Games, according to UCF.
Scott, who wasn’t even supposed to compete in the event, was able to advance to the finals in the 100M race with a time of 11.38, UCF said. Scott then managed to run an 11.28 to beat Lithuania’s Lina Grincikaite by four-hundredths of a second for the gold.
The University Games are held every other year and are organized by the International University Sports Federation. It is a multi-sport competition open to men and women who are between the ages of 17-24, and are or have been within the past year, a student at a college or university.
Scott will compete in the 200 meters preliminaries on Tuesday.



Usually on weekday game days, all classes after noon would be cancelled by UCF. This year, however, UCF will be extending class hours until 3 p.m. meaning that Memory Mall will not be open for tailgating until 4 p.m.
This is all according to an e-mail sent out to UCF faculty informing them to plan their class schedules accordingly being that UCF has two week day games this upcoming season against Akron of Aug. 29 and Rutgers on Nov.21.
The move to push back classes and start tailgating later essentially boils down to UCF being able to hold hundreds of more classes that would otherwise be cancelled. The games, which tentatively start at 7p.m. means that there will only be three hours of “open container” before the football games at Memory Mall.
The game against USF, which will be held on Friday Nov. 29 will have a full day of tailgating being that it is over Thanksgiving break and no normal classes are scheduled.
