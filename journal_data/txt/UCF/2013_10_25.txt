More than 6,000 tickets remain for the UCONN game on Saturday.
Sales have come at nearly double the rate of a normal game week, according to UCF’s senior associate athletic director Zach Lassiter. However, there is still plenty of tickets to be sold. South Carolina fans accounted for buying thousands of tickets to the sellout game back in September, but UCONN fans have only bought a couple of hundred.
Tickets remain available both online at UCFKnights.com and via phone at 407-823-1000. Tickets can also be purchased at the box office on Saturday.
