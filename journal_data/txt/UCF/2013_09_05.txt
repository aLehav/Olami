UCF recently installed 340 new “Dell Optiplex 2010 All-In-One” computers in the John C. Hitt library, totaling a cost of $383,552 for the university.
The computers are faster than the previous computers in the library, which were old and out of warranty and had developed a number of problems,  such as the inability to properly accommodate video in Canvas (online course platform).
The new computers will require and NID and NID password to access, however, visitors are able to get a guest account when they enter the library. 
The new computers also save any documents to the specific student’s NID, enabling that student to save their work and access it again from any PC on the NET domain on campus (John C. Hitt Library, Tech Commons labs, labs in Colleges, etc.).  
The purchase of the computers was funded by the Student Technology Fee. 



UCF President John Hitt will hold the annual State of the University Address this September.
President Hitt invites the community to join him on Tuesday, September 24, at 3 p.m. in the Pegasus Ballroom where he will discuss opportunities and challenges at UCF, along with his vision for the university’s future.

Doors for the event will open at 2:30 p.m. A reception will follow the address.
