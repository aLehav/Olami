UCF has now removed statements about expressing the need for anti-racism after house bill HB7 went into effect on July 1. 
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed what he is referring to as the “Stop WOKE Act” which will limit the teachings of race and Critical Race Theory that would make students feel they bear personal guilt and responsibility for mistreatment of particular groups of individuals based on their race, color or sex. 
Shelley Park, a professor of Philosophy at UCF said she was disappointed with the removal of these messages from the department’s website as Park believed the statement, “stood behind diversity, equity and inclusivity — which didn’t used to be such a radical thing to say.
Assistant Vice President Chad Binette said the removal of the statements were due to the statements being seen as creating a potential unwelcoming environment for all the University’s faculty and students. 
“The university recently removed some departmental statements that could be seen as potentially inconsistent with our commitment to creating a welcoming environment — one where faculty objectively engage students in robust, scholarly discussions that expand their knowledge and empower them to freely express their views and form their own perspectives,” Binette said. “UCF is committed to building a culture that values respect, civil discourse, and creating a sense of belonging,” Binette said. “In an effort to more clearly communicate that commitment, we will be working with departments to ensure statements better align with our university values.” 
Ann Gleig, a religious studies professor for UCF said that the removal of the statement is unfair after the Philosophy department crafted the message after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in the summer of 2020. 
“This is a complete infringement of academic freedom,” Gleig said. “The statement was crafted over a period of time with dialogue and input across a twenty person plus faculty trained in philosophy, religion and cultural studies and the humanities.” 



The UCF Athletics Association have struck a deal with Playfly that will be a 13-year multimedia rights contract worth $125 million. 
This is BIG 📈We're excited to continue growing the UCF brand regionally, nationally and globally with @playflysports!
“This multimedia rights agreement is groundbreaking for UCF and signifies our media value in the marketplace,” said Terry Mohajir, UCF Vice President and Director of Athletics. “It’s validation of our value as an institution and the result of investments made by the Board of Trustees, University leadership, students, alumni, central Florida region, State of Florida and Big 12 Conference.” 
Playfly which labels themselves as a leading sports marketing & media company, will take over UCF’s multimedia rights after a previous long-term agreement with IMG after former Athletic director Danny White chose not to renew the deal back in July 2016. 
The deal will start this year and run through 2035, with a “midpoint” where both sides will review the overall performance and market value of the multimedia rights in 2029. 
Mohajir said the UCFAA could receive additional payments from Playfly if their gross revenue exceeds the set threshold for that year. 
“Any Premium products that are in these corporate sponsorship deal, they’re paying up and above the rights fee for them,” Mohajir said. “That can be another $200,000 in ticket sales, premium products, club seats, all that kind of stuff as well.” 
Mohajir said he believes the deal will prove to be more financially lucrative for the Knights due to how he believes the Knights will perform in the Big 12. 
“We’re thinking this deal is closer to a $140 Million-type deal when you add everything in there,” Mohajir said. “We just don’t know what everything is going to be yet. We haven’t gotten to the definitive contract yet but it’s more than the $125 million.”
