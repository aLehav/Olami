Chris Clemente and Rachel Altfield have officially been sworn-in as the new Student Body President and Vice President, after former Chief Justice Taylor Scimeca delivered an oath of office to the duo shortly after 10am Wednesday in the Student Union.
Clemente and Altfield were elected in March after a grueling and controversial process which saw one set of candidates kicked off of the ballot for election violations, and a separate candidate who appeared  to emulate presumptive Republican nominee Donald J. Trump.
With the election behind them, Clemente and Altfield look forward to their tenure and the chance to deliver on their campaign promises of safety, sustainability, and transparency.
“It’s finally here,” Altfield stated after being sworn-in. “We’re officially in office, and I can’t wait to start this journey and this job. I’m looking forward to the year to come.”
Clemente echoed his partner’s sentiments, saying “The last couple of weeks have been headache-after-headache about finals, but now it’s all realized. We made it. This is it, but at the same time, it’s also the beginning. We’re going to hit the ground running.”
The first order of business for the duo will be appointments to their administration’s Executive Cabinet. Students are encouraged to apply here before the due date on May 13.
