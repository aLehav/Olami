Firetrucks at UCF Towers
At least three firetrucks were reported on scene in the area of Tower 4. Towers resident Jonathan Cannon told KnightNews.com residents were told that a cooking fire grew larger after residents tried putting it out with a towel. 
Cannon said he was told a large amount of smoke needs to be aired out before theyâ€™ll let residents back in.
KnightNews.com is working to gather more details and will post updates when we get them.
