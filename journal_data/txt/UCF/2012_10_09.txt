For the second time in the Orlando native’s career, Quincy McDuffie was named C-USA Special Teams Player of the Week.
McDuffie, from Edgewater, put the Knights on the board with a 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown when the Knights needed it most.
Down 14-0 in the first quarter, McDuffie got some key blocks and made the right cuts to take the ball to the house.
He ended the day with 128 return yards on two returns, in addition to a 63-yard touchdown reception.
McDuffie is only 42 return yards away from claiming the title of UCF’s all time return yardage leader.  Ted Wilson (83′-86′) currently sits on the throne with 2,121 return yards but McDuffie is closing in fast with 2,080.
In addition to McDuffie, UCF kicker Shawn Moffitt, a Dr.Phillips graduate, earned CFPA National Specialist of the Week honors with his perfect 4-for-4 field goal outing.
Moffitt drilled a career long 49-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. The presence of a proficient field goal kicker for the Knights is an asset that the team has often lacked in the past, but Moffitt gives the team that valuable option on a fourth down just outside the enemies red zone.
 



Jerry Sandusky received his sentence Tuesday, according to ABC News, and it amounts to what basically is a life sentence for the 68-year-old — 30 years in prison. 
It’s the latest twist in the child abuse scandal that led to the disgrace of former Penn State coach Joe Paterno.

The sentence comes after Sandusky issued an audio statement to a campus radio station denying responsibility for the situation, and even blaming the victims.
