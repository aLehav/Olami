According to the Associated Press, Emma Watson is leaving Brown University and attending another university in the fall — and so far, there’s no evidence she’ll transfer to UCF.
The AP report says Watson has not announced where she’ll go to school next. Recent reports suggested that she was bullied out of Brown, but Watson’s rep Vanessa Davis dismissed those rumors to the Associated Press.

A campus blog that tends to print lots of fake stories about Michael Kilbride’s SGA posted a story claiming Watson was transferring to UCF. Many students believed the satirical campus blog, shared the story on Facebook, and spread the rumor. 
Again, the Associated Press and other respected media outlets, along with KnightNews.com, have received no indication Watson will attend UCF; and at this point, the AP is reporting Watson hasn’t announced where she’ll transfer.
