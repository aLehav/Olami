Within days of KnightNews.com asking tough questions about secret Student Government Association meetings, retaining an attorney to try and obtain SGA impeachment audio records and interviewing Orange County Commissioner Linda Stewart about a lack of transparency in SGA and alleged “misuse” of funds, the embattled organization admitted its controversial policies are now under review. 
“In an effort to best represent the UCF Student Body, the UCF Student Government Association pays close attention to all input about our policies and procedures,” read a statement released on behalf of UCF SGA President Michael Kilbride’s administration. “In light of the recent discussion about our impeachment bylaws, SGA has begun a review of our internal policies.”

KnightNews.com received the statement this afternoon after making state officials in Tallahassee aware of serious concerns about the way public records requests were handled by the University, from the smallest SGA office all the way to the office of President John C. Hitt. 
The SGA statement also claimed, “The rights of students are of paramount importance to us and we will travel all avenues that lead to the best degree of representation.”
Knightnews.com’s lawyer, Robert Rivas, had this to say: “If the Student Senate expeditiously repeals every provision for secret meetings, they will have done what is required of them by the law.   If they don’t, we will make an appointment for a judge to explain it to them, and the SGA will pay my fees.  No real lawyer would argue in court in defense of their position.”
