Jason Diehl (Gahtzu) is the UCF student who will be attempting to break the record by playing over 48 hours. This summer,  different people will start practicing for the actual event date. This event will be streamed through different sites, such as Chibo and twitch.tv. They will also have D’Ron Maingrette (D1) which is going to be the commentator for this event.
#Smashtherecord is a charity event and will be asking for $10 donations at the door. Their goal is $15,000 for the weekend and all proceeds will go to the Prevent Cancer Foundation. They will also ask people who are playing on stream to donate $1 for each set (3/5) that they play.
While UCF’s A&SF fees were able to provide about $4,600 to the event, the club still needs to raise about $3,300 more. Gaming Knights will be doing different things to raise the money such as selling t-shirts through their sponsor, Teespring, which will have all the participants names printed on the back. 
The club will also use a GoFundMe page as a funding platform for this event. Some of the main sponsors for this event which will be helping with funding and promotions include: Microsoft, Monster Energy, Alex Jebailey from Community Effort Orlando, CLASH tournaments, and Twitch.tv
