UPDATE 6/19: Live video of the Board of Governor’s meeting on the UCF campus, when available:

Gov. Rick Scott spoke today and told the board how he is opposed to tuition hikes. 
But UCF may have a hard time getting that amount approved. During an interview, State University System Chancellor Frank Brogan said, “If universities are walking into next week’s meeting in Orlando simply expecting to get a 15 percent differential (tuition) increase, they need to think again.”

UCF Student Body President Cortez Whatley voted for the full 15 percent tuition hike during the UCF Board of Trustees meeting in May. He also sits on the Board of Governors. KnightNews.com will let you know if Whatley, like the UF and USF leaders, has a change of heart and votes for a tuition hike that is less than the maximum amount possible.  
UF’s student body president voted against a proposed 15 percent hike before settling on a 9 percent hike, saying it was a good compromise between administration and students. 
Gov. Rick Scott has been pressuring decision makers not to raise tuition, have said he does not believe in tuition increases. University leaders say the tuition hikes are needed to make up for budget cuts to higher education.
