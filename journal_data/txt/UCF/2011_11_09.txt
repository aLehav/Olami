KnightNews.com obtained the following message sent to students on behalf of UCF President John C. Hitt which confirms reports about UCF’s response to alleged NCAA violations.


Earlier this year, the NCAA began an investigation of possible infractions committed by the UCF football and men’s basketball programs. We recently received the NCAA’s report.
>
> I expect our athletics leadership to set the standard for compliance with the NCAA. In our initial evaluation of the NCAA report, we clearly see that our athletics leadership did not live up to that standard.
>
> Therefore, today I accepted the resignation of Director of Athletics Keith Tribble. Assistant football coach David Kelly also resigned, and I suspended men’s basketball coach Donnie Jones for three conference games without pay and will issue him an official letter of reprimand.
>
> The NCAA reported multiple violations and specifically cited Tribble and Kelly for unethical conduct when meeting with NCAA investigators. They will have the opportunity to personally challenge these allegations with the NCAA.
>
> I thank former AD Tribble and former assistant coach Kelly for their many positive contributions to UCF and wish them well in the future.
>
> Additionally, I have ordered that we begin a comprehensive review of the Athletics Association, the goal of which is to help us strengthen our commitment to compliance with the NCAA.
>
> We cooperated fully with the NCAA during its investigation, which does not involve football coach George O’Leary or any sports beyond football and men’s basketball.
>
> Earlier today, I reached out to Conference USA Commissioner Britton Banowsky and Big East Commissioner John Marinatto to personally inform them of our actions. Both had been aware of the ongoing NCAA investigation.
>
> This report will not impact our conference realignment prospects.
>
> UCF will immediately begin a national search for its new director of Athletics.
>
> I have appointed Al Harms, UCF’s vice president for Strategy, Marketing, Communications and Admissions, as interim director of Athletics. A retired Navy vice admiral, he previously served as interim director of Athletics in 2006. Among other duties, he currently oversees UCF football game day operations.
>
> Admiral Harms is a leader of extraordinary integrity who has my complete confidence. No one is better suited to begin this rebuilding process.
>
> The NCAA grants institutions 90 days to respond to the allegations. During this time, UCF will further review the report to determine how to move forward. As part of that review, we will consider possible institutional penalties we could self-impose.
>
> I expect our entire athletics program — from the walk-ons to the All Americans, the trainers to the coaches, the athletics administration to our boosters – to play by the rules. Nothing else is acceptable.
>
> To our fans, I pledge this: UCF will address these problems in a clear, consistent, and just manner
The note went on to say UCF will provide more information soon.
