Dennis Sherer, managing partner, spoke to KnightNews.com about the new location.
“Our goal is to be a part of the community, be a part of the college and provide a great experience for the students,” Sherer stated.
“The energy of the employees is really great because it’s a lot of the college aged kids; they’re really good at this concept because they have to interact so if they have to interact with people they’re similar to, or if their friends come in, it makes it a more fun environment,” Houston Albritton, new restaurant opening manager said. Albritton traveled with the company to assist the opening at UCF.
