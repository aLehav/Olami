The UCF Knights move on in the American Athletic Conference tournament after clearing past East Caroline 66-52 Thursday evening in Downtown Orlando.
UCF was up by 16 with 12 minutes left in the half and played steady through the second half. ECU managed to narrow the lead to 1, but the Knights held on and a brief back-and-forth effort soon saw the score widen to double digits.
The Knights were successful from the 3-point line at the Amway Arena, shooting 44%. However, they struggled from the line, shooting 56%.
A.J. Davis made it very clear he is not ready for his UCF career to be over.  Playing 33 minutes, scoring 14 points. B.J. Taylor lead the team in scoring with 17. He also played 32 minutes. These two will be critical as the Knights move forward in the AAC tournament.  Hopefully fatigue doesn’t not play a factor as the Knights move into the weekend.
Dayon Griffin and Ceasar DeJesus both played exceptional tonight.  Scoring a combined 18 points. UCF will need to supplement their scoring if they would like to have continued success throughout the weekend.
Round two of the The American conference tournament will see the Black and Gold take on Houston Friday evening at the Amway Center at 9 p.m.



Beta Theta Pi will have its final hearing Friday at 1 p.m., UCF confirmed to Knight News. 
The hearing will determine if Beta is “in violation” of UCF hazing policies. Beta has been on “interim” suspension for months, while UCF investigated the claims. 
Knight News obtained the audio from the interim hearing (above) as well as UCF’s investigative report (here).
