The ALS Ice Bucket challenge took off around the UCF community, with everyone from sororities to sports teams being nominated to dump a bucket of ice on their heads for a great cause.
The ALS office received $160,000 during a recent 10-day period and that doesn’t even include the money that has been sent to chapter offices. Last year, they received less than $14,000 in donations in the same 10-day period.
The Kappa Sigma fraternity nominated KnightNews.com to take the challenge. Here’s KnightNews.com’s response:

We now nominate SGA President Weston Bayes, UCF President John C. Hitt and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. UCF’s Alpha Tau Omega fraternity nominated Blake Bortles to take the challenge. Check back to see if any of them respond.
