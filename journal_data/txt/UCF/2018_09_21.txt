UCF’s undefeated streak extended to sixteen games as the Knights took down Lane Kiffin and FAU 56-36 at home in a high-powered game.
Two touchdowns came at the hands of the Black and Gold early in the first quarter, met by a shaky second quarter when the Owls stole the lead and outscored UCF 10-7. An easy breakaway from the slump gave 35 points to the home team and a pick-six in the remaining minutes.
McKenzie Milton ran three rushing touchdowns and passed for three, tying his career-high touchdown record for a single game set last year during Memphis. Milton will surely return to the Heisman conversation, making up for a successful but not up-to-par performance against SC State, who was on the receiving end of a 38-0 beatdown.
