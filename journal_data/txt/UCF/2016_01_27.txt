One of american television’s favorite father figures will be coming out of the television set and straight to the University of Central Florida stage.
UCF’s Campus Activities Board has announced Bob Saget as the spring comedy show headliner.
“We’re so excited to bring such a renowned TV and comedy personality for this year’s spring comedy show,” said CAB Comedy Director Chris Mayhew in a release. “Bob Saget is a household name who has entertained audiences for many years.”
Fortune Feimster and Last Knight Standing winner Gray Bigler will warm up the stage for Saget as the opening acts.
Saget is known for playing the lovable, clean-freak father Danny Tanner on Full House and for hosting America’s Funniest Home Videos.
Saget has been known to embrace a different, more dark side in his stand up shows which led him to a Grammy nomination for his stand-up special That’s What I’m Talking About. He’s also had cameos on Entourage and The Aristocrats. In 2007, Saget released an R-rated comedy/ love story called Face of the Penguins.
Saget’s The Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget had the second highest ratings of the night it premiered, following the Olympics.
Feimster was named by Variety one of the “Top 10 Comics to Watch” in 2014. She is mostly know as a full-time performer/writer on Chelsea Lately and Nurse Collette on The Mindy Project. Feimster was a semi-finalist on NBC’s Last Comic Standing in 2010. Since then, she has appeared on Glee, Two Broke GIrls, Workaholics, Drunk History and Conan.

The show will be March 23 at 8 p.m. Doors will open at 7 p.m. Tickets will be available for UCF students at the SGA Ticket Center for $5 and $25 for the general public at the CFE Arena Box Office and TicketMaster.
