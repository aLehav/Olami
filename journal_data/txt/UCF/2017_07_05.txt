“The university is in talks with a restaurant owner about leasing the space formerly occupied by Kyoto, but there’s no agreement yet,” UCF News & Information Assistant Director Mark Schlueb said.
UCF officials will provide an update on potential restaurant replacements as discussions move further along.
