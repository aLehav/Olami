Construction on Phase 1 of the 21st Century Library project has begun, leading the next year in work that will add a four-story Automated Retrieval Center (ARC) to accommodate 1.25 million print volumes.
Phase 1 completion allows for quick retrieval in part of the quarter-and-a-million print volumes over three stories, with Phase 2 topping the structure with a fourth story student workspace surrounded by glass windows.
The construction that has been seen by students in the closing week of the Summer terms includes installation of power and plumbing lines. A new parking area in front of the College of Sciences plans to be laid out by crews, replacing the previous small parking lot in order to make way for the Automated Retrieval Center project.
The John C. Hitt Library holds the distinction of UCF’s first building. Built in 1967, and approaching its 50th birthday, the library takes part in a nation-wide collegiate effort to improve campus beautification and amenities to current and prospective students as well as campus visitors.
The university’s first building doubled in size in 1984 to meet growing demands and will expand once more when construction meets completion in Fall 2017, according to Maria Teimouri, a facilities planning and construction project manager.
As promised by UCF, according to current plans, additional seating, power outlets, 24-hour study rooms, research and collaboration space, and other renovations will be open to students beginning Fall 2017 with Phase 1.
The Automated Retrieval Center will house 300,000 of the most used and current books to allow for easier access for students throughout the year. Wait times for these books have been approximated to be between 5-10 minutes from the ARC to the circulation desk.
A comprehensive list of the additions and renovations offered by the 21st Century Library has been assembled by the UCF News & Information Office:
