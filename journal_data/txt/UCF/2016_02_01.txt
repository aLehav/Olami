Ever since entering the Presidential race, Bernie Sanders has motivated a large segment of the Democratic Party to “Feel the Bern.”
At the beginning of the political season no one gave Bernie a chance against Hillary Clinton, but against all odds, Bernie has now positioned himself to where his presidential candidacy is an actual possibility.
Here in Iowa, Bernie Sanders has hundreds of volunteers from all backgrounds working on making him the winner of the Democratic Iowa State Caucus.

A common theme among all the volunteers here at his Iowa headquarters is that they love how he isn’t owned by any corporations, just by the people who fund his campaign, according to his volunteers.
These volunteers have gone door to door, called potential voters and spread the message of Bernie Sanders. These volunteers truly believe Bernie is what America needs.
