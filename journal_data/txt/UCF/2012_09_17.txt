Former presidential candidate Herman Cain will be coming to the UCF Arena on September 19 at 6pm as part of the College Truth Tour.
Cain will be discussing the “uncertainty” in America and the current state of college students around the nation.

The site lists this as a fun event saying, if you go to school or live in the community near one of the campuses we will be visiting, please join us for this discussion.  This is not a lecture.  Instead, it will be a fun, educational event with Herman Cain and a popular local band.  If you are not close, please join the discussion online.  We want to hear from you!
The event is free for students. Click here to reserve a ticket for the event.
