The director of ESPN’s “Our Time: UCF Football,” a multi-part, all-access documentary series that streamed exclusively on ESPN+, was shot and killed by Russian forces.
Brett Renaud, a 55-year old American journalist, was traveling in the town of Irpin outside the capital of Kyiv to film refugees with his colleague, Juan Arredondo, when Russian troops opened fire, according to CBS.
Arredondo, a documentary filmmaker, suffered wounds, but ultimately survived the attack.
“Somebody offered to take us to the other bridge, and we crossed a checkpoint, and they started shooting at us. So the driver turned around, and they kept shooting, two of us. My friend is Brent Renaud, and he’s been shot and left behind,” said Arredondo, who is also American. “I saw him being shot in the neck, and we got split, and I got pulled.”

While filming “Our Time: UCF Football,” Renaud developed a close relationship with former UCF quarterback Dillon Gabriel.
I’m so shook right now. We got so close during your time with me at UCF. We checked on each other so often and talked about so much during my time off of the field. We even talked about when you used to go to Iran to film documentaries. Rest In Peace Brent. God bless. Prayers up. https://t.co/o2wiD2WC0g
According to CBS, the State Department confirmed Renaud’s death on Sunday.
“We offer our sincerest condolences to his family on their loss,” a spokesperson said.
