KnightNews.com has covered how Adderall has become a popular “study drug” at UCF that many students take illegally — especially during final exam time. 
Now a new study pill has surfaced, and this one doesn’t require a prescription, according to NBC2 news in Ft. Myers, which reports students at FGCU are happy with the new Adderall alternative, called ADDTabz. See their report below:

According to the ADDTabz website, the pill “uses Ampheta-CDP as it’s active compound. Ampheta-CDP is the amplified hybrid of Ampheta-HCL. Ampheta-HCL is widely regarded as the most advanced and effective Synthetic Amphetamine (non-prescription pharmaceutical) in the world with use in multiple products sold throughout the globe.”
