Parking Garage-C will see expansions to the east side of the 4-story structure, adding approximately 600 parking spaces to the current 1,290 spaces – an almost 50 percent increase – according to UCF officials.
A $30 million research and incubation laboratory will take up lots allocated for faculty and staff parking within the next year, leading the university to make up for lost spaces with the plans for additional parking along Gemini Boulevard East.
The $9 million four-story addition is expected to begin construction in November and finish in July 2016.
The new parking spaces will benefit current UCF students, officials said.
Rendering is intended to provide visualization for the expansion and does not reflect final concept.
