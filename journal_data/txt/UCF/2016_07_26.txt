There will be no contest during the convention between Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however the same may not be said for the Democratic Party.
Despite leaked emails from the DNC that resulted in the stepping down of DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Bernie Sanders supporters conducting anti-Hillary protests throughout the city, the Vermont Senator doubled down on his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president.
Sanders reminded the crowd of the meaning of this election, stating that it wasn’t about himself, Hillary Clinton, or even Donald Trump, but instead about the American people.
There was large speculation as to whether the recent DNC email fiasco would waver the Democratic runner-up’s support for Clinton, and tears flowed throughout the crowd during the Senator’s concession speech, as he attempted to rally his supporters behind Clinton, the soon to be nominee.
Sanders was the final major speaker of day one of the DNC, and received the largest support from the crowd.
Knight News will be back at the Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday for day two of the Democratic National Convention, stay tuned for continued coverage.
