The University of Central Florida will ask the state to raise student fees by $2 per credit hour to pay for a planned $64.4 million renovation of the newly renamed John C. Hitt Library, according to the Orlando Business Journal. 
The OBJ reports UCF indicated the construction project would created about 650 temporary construction jobs. 
That issue, and many others, will be addressed at the Florida Board of Governors meeting scheduled for June 19 to June 21 on UCFâ€™s campus. 
UCF SGA President Cortez Whatley was recently named as a member of the BOG, which oversees the state university system.
