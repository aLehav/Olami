Gabriel suffered a fractured clavicle during the Knights’ week three loss at Louisville that caused him to miss the remainder of the season.
The junior announced his decision to transfer just one day following the Knights’ regular season finale win vs. South Florida.
Despite playing just two seasons (2019-21) for the Knights, Gabriel ranks fourth all-time in UCF history with 8,041 total passing yards.
Gabriel’s 70 touchdown passes also ranks fourth in UCF history.
The former Knight QB led the Knights’ offense to finish among the nation’s top 2 offenses in back-to-back seasons (2019-20, 2020-21).
This breaking story will be updated as more information becomes available.
