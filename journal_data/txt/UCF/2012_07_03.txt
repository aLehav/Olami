One of UCFâ€™s most well-known and popular bars, Scoop, has announced that this will be their last week open. With the plaza being completely torn down by September 30, 2012, Scoop has decided to close their doors early.
Previously the same venue as Deko Lounge, Scoop opened in the plaza during the winter of 2011 after their old location on Alafaya and Colonial closed.
Knightnews.com will be sure to keep you updated if a new location for Scoop is announced.

UCF SGA President Cortez Whatley has released a video addressing why he voted in favor of the full 15 percent tuition hikes.
Note: This video was not shot by Knightnews.com and we retrieved it off of the SGA website.

However, Cortez still did not address what Senator Don Gaetz said about the University reserves covering the budget cuts. Watch below to hear the Florida Senator specifically say that no operating funds for any academic programs were going to be affected, and that the Senators were simply asking to draw money out of the UCF reserves.
