ORLANDO, Fla.- Your last chance to honor the 2017 UCF football team will take place this upcoming Tuesday. The athletic department is putting on an event called, The National Championship Hoopla, January 16th. The night the UCF basketball team takes on #12 Cincinnati.
There will be plenty of features during this game to help you celebrate greatness one last time. There will be a photo station for fans to take pictures with UCF’s claimed trophies. This will include all the trophies won this year, as well as trophies won in years past.  The football team will also make an appearance Tuesday night.  They will be honored at halftime, with a special presentation put together by the athletic department.
It doesn’t stop there.  UCF will be handing out limited edition perfect season scorecards.  The first 500 students will receive Knightmare T-Shirts. Special Jr. Knights programs for this game will be handed out, it will come with a Peach Bowl rally flag. If you get there late and can’t take advantage of the neat prizes and activities, don’t worry, you still have a chance to catch a National Championship T-Shirt. They will be tossed periodically throughout the game.
Tuesday should be a great time for Knight fans.  Not only will the fans have an opportunity to take advantage of these extra-curricular activities, it should be a great basketball game.  Cincinnati is ranked 12th in the nation.  UCF needs to win big games like this if they’d like an at large bid this year.  Who knows, we might even get to see the return of B.J. Taylor.
The game starts at 7:00 P.M, gates open at 6.  Get there early to take advantage off all of these opportunities.
