A University of Central Florida graduate died during last Saturday’s football game against the University of Connecticut at Bright House Networks Stadium, according to a report.
According to the Orlando Sentinel, 2002 UCF graduate Shane Brintnall collapsed during halftime and was pronounced dead at Florida Hospital East.
“The entire UCF community expresses its condolences to Mr. Brintnall’s family and friends,” UCF spokesperson Courtney Gilmartin told the Orlando Sentinel.
Brintnall, 34, of Palm Beach Gardens, fell and struck his head while walking beneath the stadium, spectator Brian Pastermack told the Orlando Sentinel, who saw the fall and waited with Brintnall until paramedics arrived.
According to the Orlando Sentinel, Brintnall attended The King’s Academy in West Palm Beach and became a certified public accountant after graduating from UCF with a Business Administration degree. 
The Orange-Osceola Medical Examiner’s Office is determining the cause of death.
