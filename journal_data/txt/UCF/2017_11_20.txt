A firm with a chequered past when it comes to scouting university presidents in Florida is being considered by the University of Central Florida Presidential Search Committee to help find President John Hitt’s successor.
Back in 2014, William Funk & Associates was given a vote of no confidence in the firm’s ability to find FSU’s next president by the school’s faculty senate, according to inside Higher Ed.
If selected, UCF will pay William Funk $100,000 for its service.
The board was presented with six possible contracts with prices ranging from $99,000 to $150,000.
Along with this controversial selection, two other firms were selected to the next round: Korn Ferry, which would cost the university one-third of the total compensation of the new president, including base salary; and Parker Search, which UCF contracted to hire Athletics Director Danny White and would charge $150,000.
These firms will be presented to UCF Board of Trustees Chairman Marcos Marchena, who is expected to make a final decision on which firm will search for the next UCF president by Wednesday.
The committee also decided to use an outside third-party firm to determine the salary of UCF’s next president. This decision will cost UCF approximately $30,000, according to UCF Vice President and General Counsel Scott Cole.
During the meeting, Marchena stressed to the search committee what qualities make a great president. 
“You’re looking for someone who can stand on the shoulders of a giant and not only reach for the stars, but actually catch one. No pressure, no pressure at all,” Marchena told the committee. “We achieve that goal by staying true to UCF’s culture.”
He hopes the committee will have made their recommendations for Hitt’s replacement by March.
UCF Student Government Vice President and student representative on the committee, Cristina Barreto, did not have much to say during the search firm selection process and, following the meeting, declined to speak with Knight News about William Funk or the search process in general.
The search committee will meet again on Dec. 4.



With a game ticket at her side, UCF junior Miranda DeOnofrio would be one of tens of thousands of fans set to watch history in Spectrum Stadium following Thanksgiving Day.
A Knights football fan at heart, her path to UCF began in the unlikeliest of places, down the road in Tampa, Florida.
At the age of 14, young DeOnofrio needed a spinal fusion to be performed at Shrine’s Hospital for Children in Tampa – coincidentally, right next to USF, her father Rich DeOnofrio said.
“We had many, many trips to the hospital before and after the surgery. Many trips past USF. In her head, she decided she wanted to be a Bull to the point that we had to buy her a USF sweatshirt to wear,” Rich went on.
Through high school a future in Tampa Bay seemed certain.
As a growing teen, Miranda spent much of her time at the hospital and near the University of South Florida. Sure that she would become a Bulls student and fan, Miranda would place a trip to the University of Central Florida during her senior year ‘just for the heck of it,’ only to return home to announce she was going to be a Knight; her sights set on Orlando.
“She always said that in her heart she felt that after her trip, UCF was where she belonged. The irony of the beginning, to this part, is one thing. The irony for the rest is that she did the 180 and now they were her fiercest rival. She attended games, she attended tailgates, and I was even able to attend a game with Miranda and her friends,” Rich said.
If Miranda had work, she was listening to the games on her phone. She knew the players, their statistics, and “everything you could think of.” Miranda decided on a major in thanks to her psychology professor at UCF, inspiring the then-first-year student to become a UCF professor herself one day.
“As a freshman, I believe students are still trying to find their place. Not her. She knew that she bled Knight blood,” Rich continued.
“This past year, she insisted on wearing her Knights shirt ‘in case there were any USF players’ and to show them! I was just with her 3 weeks ago when I asked her about the big game and she reached into her purse, got out her wallet, and showed me her ticket as if it were Willy Wonka’s Golden Ticket. She loved the university and football team.”
On Friday night, one week before the rivalry game, Miranda suffered from an asthma attack and passed away at an Oviedo hospital. At 20 years old, DeOnofrio found her calling in forensic psychology and a place at UCF she would call home. And from the best bird’s eye view one can get, her father says, Miranda will be cheering on the Knights in their best run in program history as they play USF at home.
“She loved UCF and had her ticket for next week,” Rich finished. “The team will have some extra help on Friday from up above.”



The University of Central Florida has announced a sellout game for the War on I-4 featuring the undefeated No. 15 UCF Knights (CFP) versus the USF Bulls.
