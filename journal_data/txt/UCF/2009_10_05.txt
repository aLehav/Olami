READ SHERRIF’S OFFICE REPORT:  
 
 
 
 
 
 UPDATE 10:30 A.M. 10/5
A Jimmy John’s restaurant popular with UCF students, located right on University Blvd., was robbed early Sunday morning.
At least two male workers, one 19 and the other 22, were cleaning the store lobby at 3:30 a.m. when two men, whose faces were masked with bandannas, barged in and pointed black semi-automatic handguns at them, according to an Orange County Sheriff’s Office report obtained by KnightNews.com.
According to the report, one robber forced the workers to open the cash register and give up all the money inside while the other robber ordered the victims to give him all the money in their wallets, as well as their cell phones.
The robbers ran out of the store on foot, and a search by sheriff’s office dogs and helicopter wasn’t enough to catch them.
KnightNews.com is still working to get more information from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, and will update this story when possible.

UPDATE:
According to reports, at 4:23PM a message was sent out saying that the lock down was over and students could continue with normal activities. No injuries have been reported.

The University of South Florida (USF) website has been updated this afternoon to inform students that there has been an armed intruder on its Tampa Campus.
An update at 1:50PM this afternoon informed all students to stay indoors and lock their doors.
A second update at 2:09PM warned that the intruder was in the main campus library and that the Bull Runner Transit System (the University’s bus service) has been closed down.
At 2:48PM the website was updated again to say that the USF police got a report that a subject with a bomb and gun was somewhere around the main library.  There has also been a report that the subject in question was riding a bus in the area.  The police are investigating these reports.  Knightnews.com will continue to investigate and provide details as they come.
Here at UCF we also have ways to protect students when life-threatening events happen on campus.  According to emergency.ucf.edu, in case of an emergency, the primary way to contact students would be through updates on the main page of the UCF website,  four outdoor sirens which will produce a tone followed by an emergency message, text messages, Knights Email, and through NOAA weather radios (in case of a weather emergency).
Besides the primary methods, the university would also try informing students through the UCF main telephone line, employee two-way radios, Bright House Emergency Alert Systems, vehicle public address speakers, press releases to local news sources and radios, and through social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.



After weeks of planning and campaigning, the results have finally been announced. At exactly 6 P.M. on September 30th, the election commissioners exited the Student Union, results in hand, and declared the winners.
Now, the 10 senatorial hopefuls who didn’t get more than 50 percent of the vote, will compete in a runoff election starting today and ending at 5 p.m. this Wednesday.
After the results were announced Wednesday, KnightNews.com was able to speak with a few of the candidates, including William Lively, a co-leader of the BAMF ticket, who did not win his seat.
He expressed disappointment, but said that he was “happy for the others who won”. For the future, he didn’t reveal many plans, except to help out other BAMF members who are a part of the 42nd Senate.
We were also able to talk to Chris Hanley, who went unopposed for seat 2 in the College of Medicine. Although he was happy for himself, he explained that he was shocked.
“I don’t really have a reaction right now” Hanley said. “I’m shocked that the other ticket got the first seat, and Reggie [a member of the Unite Ticket] didn’t get it.”
As almost everyone had left, KnightNews.com caught up with Graham Austin, who ran as an independent in the College of Sciences. Even though he was disappointed, he found some positives from the whole experience.
“It was fun, and I learned a lot,” Austin explained. “It was a great experience running for myself, instead of campaigning for others. I knew I had no chance of winning outright, but I pushed it into a runoff. I got my name out there and made a dent.”
We also learned that Graham plans to run for the Senate Leadership Council in the future.
Stay tuned for updates on this week’s runoff elections.
