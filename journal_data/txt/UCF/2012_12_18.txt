In the first big policy change since Facebook bought the rights to Instagram three months ago, the photo-sharing app has updated it’s privacy policy allowing the app to advertise with user photos, without their permission.
The new policy is not set to go in until effect January 16th, but some users are concerned on how their photos could end up as advertisements on Instagram and Facebook.
Under the heading of “rights” Instagram states the following on the new change: “To help us deliver interesting paid or sponsored content or promotions, you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.”
Not only does the new privacy policy create the possibility of user photos ending up as advertisements, but Instagram changed the current language about users granting “limited-license” for the use of their photos. On January 16, that will change to a “sub-licenseable” agreement, meaning that Instagram would be able to sell user generated photos to third-parties.
The rest of the updated privacy policy stems around spam and hacking, but nothing as drastic as the advertisement change.
The official Instagram Twitter, @Instagram, has not mentioned the new policy change on their handle.
