The first Trader Joe’s in Central Florida opened on Friday, bringing in hundreds of eager customers to the new location.
Employees danced around and passed out Hawaiian leis to the customers before they started their shopping experience at the popular grocery chain. The Winter Park located is the third Trader Joe’s opening in the Florida area with a March opening in Tampa and a May opening in Wellington.
Trader Joe’s anticipated so much traffic, that they hired three off-duty police officers to direct traffic and monitor the crowds during the opening weekend.
The store is  located on U.S. Highway 17-92 near the Winter Park Village.



Following Thursday night’s NBA Draft, former undrafted UCF basketball players Isaiah Sykes and Tristan Spurlock received summer league invites for the Detroit Pistons and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively.
Isaiah Sykes finished his career with the Knights as the eighth leading scorer in school history, third in steals, fourth in rebounds and fifth in assists. The 6-8 Spurlock scored 897 points and knocked down 120 3-pointers during his career with UCF.
“Will be playing summer league with the @Sixers once again thanks to all the supporters much love to u all… #GrindTime,” Sykes tweeted out on Friday.
UCF Head Coach Donnie Jones coached Sykes all four years during his tenure at UCF, helping the Knights to a overall 76-52 record.
“Isaiah’s determination has paid off for him,” Jones said in a release. “We are extremely happy for him, and look forward to watching him succeed as he begins this next journey in his life.”
Spurlock worked with the Utah Jazz,  New York Knicks, and Atlanta Hawks but ultimately ended up with the Pistons. He will make his debut in the Southwest Airlines Orlando Pro Summer League July 5-11 at the Orlando Magic’s practice court at the Amway Center.
