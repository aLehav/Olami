20-year-old University of Central Florida student Keri DeMott died in a head-on crash on Saturday, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
DeMott was studying sociology in her third semester at UCF, the Orlando Sentinel said.
“DeMott of Orlando was driving west in a 2001 Honda CRV, when for unknown reasons a 2004 Honda Pilot heading east veered into DeMott’s lane, troopers said. The two vehicles collided head-on, killing DeMott,” the Sentinel reported. Florida Highway Patrol troopers told the Sentinel that the collision occurred in Brevard County at around 12:30 a.m. on State Road 407.
“The other driver, 22-year-old Keith Pumphrey of Melbourne was taken to a local hospital in critical condition,” the Orlando Sentinel said.
