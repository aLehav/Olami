On Thursday, Sept. 16, the University of Central Florida will host the first-ever Latin American/Latinx Film Festival in honor of Latinx Heritage Month in the Visual Arts Building Auditorium, room 132.
UCF being a Hispanic Serving Institution as of 2019, allows for higher education and career opportunities for Hispanic/Latino students. 
According to COS News, “The six films will emerge in social justice, in which they showcase important topics relating to the Hispanic/Latinx community and reflect their challenges and conflicts. The series will explore topics like gender issues, racism, colonialism, and LGBTQ issues.” 
The six award-winning films will be available to watch at no cost. The public can watch the films on an on-campus screen that will display every Thursday,  beginning Sept. 16 through Oct. 28. 
The UCF community can register to watch the films here.

This is a developing story and will be updated with new information. Check back with Knight News for updates.
