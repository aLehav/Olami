Former University of Florida tight end Kemore Gamble announced on Sunday that he will be transferring to UCF.
Gamble, a former four-star high school recruit from Miami, FL, started in all 13 of the Gators’ games during the 2021-22 season.
Gamble finished the season with 414 yards and four touchdowns on 13 receptions.  This includes a six-reception, 122-yard, two-touchdown performance vs. Missouri.
The former Gator also had a productive 2020-21 season, catching 10 passes for 160 yards in 12 appearances.  To top it off, Gamble scored three touchdowns on the year.
The commitment comes at a convenient time for UCF head coach Gus Malzahn and the Knights, who lost freshman WR/TE Titus Mokiao-Atimalala to the transfer portal last week.
Gamble will likely split reps with current Knights’ junior TE Alec Holler next season.
