Update: After a 6-28-1 vote in the senate, SGA Comptroller Joshua Miller avoids impeachment.
BREAKING UPDATE: Impeachment charges against A&SF Chair Josh Miller move forward to senate by a vote of 4-2. However, Speaker Wes Jones had his charges dismissed.  Also, weâ€™re working to find out if UCF broke public record law by refusing to release the impeachment documents to the public prior to the LJR meeting, a controversial move UCF has been guilty of before. 
LJR Chair Nick Simons refused to comment on the outcome of the situation and would not comment on the delayed affidavit release.
