Charges are dropped against the former UCF basketball player accused of battering his former roommate, according to court records. Despite this, the 6-foot-11 junior still faces deportation.
Rokas Ulvydas of Lithuania, 24, was charged with first-degree battery, a misdemeanor, following an alleged altercation with a former roommate in October of 2018.
Ulvydas disputes the roommate’s account of the incident. “From the very beginning, there have been false allegations,” he told Knight News.
According to the arrest affidavit, Ulvydas was upset that a roommate ignored him at a UCF tailgate. The victim told police that Ulvydas confronted and threatened him, later physically battering him at their University House apartment.
While Ulvydas is clear of criminal charges, UCF’s Student Conduct – a place where students have fewer rights to due process and the burden of proof is far less than a courtroom – trespassed and suspended him causing him problems with his student visa, his attorney said. As a result, he faces deportation later this week.

Knight News sat down for a one-on-one interview with Ulvydas where he discussed how UCF handled the situation in-depth.
