Knight News was given a tip Wednesday from a viewer that identified a possible suspect in the creepy Plaza incident where deputies said a man snuck into a woman’s apartment.
After Knight News immediately shared the information from the tip with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, deputies arrested Taylor Morrell early Thursday morning on a warrant.
A post from a Twitter account that appears to belong to the suspect denies it was him.
The tweet said, “Yeah..that [expletive] aint me man dead that.”
According to a LinkedIn that appears to belong to the suspect, he is a UCF student.
Morrell was charged with one count of burglary of a dwelling with assault or battery and one count of battery, according to jail records.
Morrell is currently being held at the Orange County Jail on a no bond status.
