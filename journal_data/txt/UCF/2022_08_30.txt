For the first time at UCF, all home football games will feature a Spanish radio broadcast that fans can access through a link on the Knights’ athletic website. 
In 2019, the U.S. Department of Education officially designated the university as a Hispanic Serving Institution after qualifying with over 25% full-time Hispanic student enrollment. With the qualification, UCF has secured additional federal funding for the improvement of the educational experience at the University which saw its Hispanic full-time enrollment rise to 28% for the 2021 fall semester. 
To celebrate our HSI designation, All @UCF_Football home games will now have an additional broadcast in Spanish thanks to Florida Blue!Help me welcome @yosoycarlosbo & @ruizsergio!! #ChargeOnhttps://t.co/s3D0Ko3v6z pic.twitter.com/aYkllU0OWP
UCF vice president and athletics director Terry Mohajir said the move to include a Spanish broadcast for the first time at football games is part of the university’s plan to better serve its Hispanic community. 
“As a designated Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), we’re thrilled to announce the Spanish broadcasts of our football games,” Mohajir said. “As Orlando’s Hometown Team, I believe we have a role to serve all members of our community and invite them to be a part of Knight Nation.” 
The broadcast team will consist of two Spanish play by play veterans, Carlos Bohorquez and Sergio Ruiz Torres. 
Bohorquez will had the play by play announcing while Torres will be the color analyst for the Knights this fall. Bohorquez previously has served as the NFL’s Spanish Radio play by play voice for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers since 2018. Torres is currently the Spanish radio play by play voice for the MLS Orlando City SC. Torres has also previously worked as a sports anchor for Univisión Orlando. 
UCF director of broadcasting, Marc Daniels who serves as the radio play by play for the Knights, said he is excited to for the addition of a Spanish broadcast team to better serve the team’s ever growing fanbase. 
“We are excited to add Spanish broadcasts for all UCF football home games this season,” Daniels said. “As Knight Nation continues to grow across the area and beyond, we feel this allows us to serve the demand of that growing fan base. We are thrilled to add Carlos and Sergio to our broadcast team of talent. They bring tremendous experience and passion and look forward to the new season.”
