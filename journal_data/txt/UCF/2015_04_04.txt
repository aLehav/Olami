A bomb threat was made to the UCF Student Union Saturday night, UCF spokesman Chad Binette said. 
Binette said the call came in anonymously to the Orlando Police Department at around 11:43 p.m. The caller said the bomb would go off in two hours. 
Orange County deputies and UCF police evacuated the Student Union and waited until the two hours were up before deputies sent in a K-9 unit to search, Binette said. 
At about 3 a.m., the all clear was given after deputies didnâ€™t find anything inside the Student Union and a helicopter searched the perimeter of the building, Binette said. 
Club Kreyol was holding a fashion show in the union, which had about 150 people attending, UCF senior Stenza Daniels said.
Daniels said she and many of the attendees left their belongings and keys inside the union. She camped out in her vehicle in a UCF parking lot until the all clear was given. 
Binette said students were allowed back inside the building to get their belongings.
