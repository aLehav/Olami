Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer sat down with KnightNews.com to talk about the UCF-USF game coming up as well as the friendly rivalry between him and Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn.
Dyer, who was born in Central Florida and attended Osceola high school, has seen UCF’s program from the very start.
Earlier this year at the Penn State-UCF game, KnightNews.com ran into Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn. Buckhorn, a Penn State alumni, said Penn State would put a “whooping” on UCF. With the UCF-USF approaching, we gave Mayor Dyer a chance to respond to Buckhorn’s comments.
