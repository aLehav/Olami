Check out our 2011 coverage here



If you didn’t believe us earlier this week when we told you students would be storming the UCF campus wearing nothing but undies — we now have the video to prove it.

Check out our original article about how Sigma Nu Fraternity, Incorporated alongside Knight-Thon and Goodwill Industries International, set in motion the Friday April 9th, 2010 undie run which promised to rival all other university underwear runs. 
To partake in the “undie” run students had to bring $2 to the event. All proceeds went to benefit Knight-Thon, according to organizers. 



UCF’s Phi Delta Theta fraternity invited KnightNews.com out to a date auction Phi Delt pledges participated in at Scoop Thursday. Scoop put on the event as part of its charity efforts to help non-profit oganizations operate. The pledges are donating the money they earned from bids to renovations Phi Delt’s new off campus fraternity house is undergoing. 
KnightNews.com caught some wild action on camera. One pledge lost his shirt, and we helped him confront everyone we could in the bar to see if they stole it! 

Phi Delt’s fall pledges participated in a similar event last semester. KnightNews.com did not go to that event, but was provided these pictures. E-mail news@knightnews.com if you’d like us to come to your next event.
