Knights Plaza, an open space in front of the CFE Arena, will be the focus of a $2.6 million construction project aimed at creating the next generation of UCF experiences.
The centerpiece of the new plaza will be a very large, black granite tile UCF Pegasus, identical to the seal in the Student Union. This centerpiece will serve as a location for special events at the arena and on campus. Tents may be set up on the plaza as well.
Two spires, one on East Plaza Drive and one on West Plaza Drive, that previously held a monthly event calendar will be retrofitted to include a flame bowl with the potential to emit 4ft-10ft natural gas-fed flames during special events.
Planters with palm trees will surround the north, east, and west sides of the plaza, with six planters containing fountains. The covered seating area on the West Plaza Drive side will see new furnishings and on the side of East Plaza Drive, near the arena box office, the university plans to expand seating and include crepe myrtles as well as additional shrubbery.
Street-level monitors will allow passerbys a look inside the arena during days of activities.
The project will not be funded by tuition nor by tax dollars. The money comes from Business Services and university auxiliary revenues.
The renovated Knights Plaza sees completion by the end of August, in time for the start of the fall semester and football season.
