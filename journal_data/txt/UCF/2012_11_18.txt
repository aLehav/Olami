A $35.6 million expansion plan for UCF’s John C. Hitt Library and outdoor Lake Claire center was approved by UCF’s Board of Trustees at their meeting last Thursday. This expansion is just the beginning of a series of proposed construction plans UCF has for its main campus.
The library expansion would retrofit a new four-story Automated Retrieval Center that would hold up to 1.5 million volumes, freeing up much of the main library to add individual and group study spaces UCF announced.
The video below shows the Automatic Retrieval System, ARS, that would be implemented into the library.

The system would allow for parts of the library to remain open 24 hours, 7 days a week. It would remove many of the lesser used books from the library main floor and put them into the retrieval storage system. 
Plans at Lake Claire call for a student services building that would also include space for boats and outdoor equipment.
The funds for the projects would be coming from the Capital Improvement Trust Fund requiring Florida’s Board of Governors to first authorize the spending before any construction can begin.
Other notable construction at UCF includes new dorms, the Academic Village II, which is costing $37,492,800 and expected to be completed by July 2013. Classroom building II costs an estimated $23,475,601 to complete and currently does not have an estimated completion date but, we expect it to be completed by fall 2013. Two new Greek sorority houses along with a Greek Life center is estimated around $5,600,000.
