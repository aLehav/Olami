The University of Central Florida has named Marc Daniels a director of broadcasting and “Voice of the Knights,” officials announced Tuesday.
After twenty-two seasons of calling UCF Football – as well as serving as the host of “The Beat of Sports” on FM 96.9/AM 740 The GAme, 101.1 FM HD 2 and on the iHeartRadio App – Daniels will be broadcasting over every football and men’s basketball game, including twenty-five baseball games during Spring 2017.
UCF also announced a partnership with iHeartRadio for the 2016-17 athletic season to broadcast games to Knights fans. The app can be downloaded for free on 969thegame.com.
Gary Parris, Jerry O’Neill, Scott Adams, Brian Fritz and Frank Lovre return with Daniels as part of the team this upcoming Fall. All five returners have over a decade of experience working with the athletic program.
A new UCF Athletics App has been announced and will be released soon, where fans can stream live UCF games, according a press release sent on Tuesday.
