The UCF men’s basketball team suffered its first loss of the season at Addition Financial Arena on Tuesday night. 
The Knights fell short to the Miami Hurricanes 79-70 after overcoming a 10- point deficit in the first half. The first half was led by redshirt senior guard  Dazon Ingram, who tacked on eight points shooting 4 for 5 from within the arc. 
In the second half,  Miami junior guard Chris Lykes clapped in Ingram’s face as UCF redshirt junior guard Collin Smith fouled out with less than seven minutes left in the second half. Ingram responded by shoving Lykes and was ejected from the game.  
With Smith and Ingram absent, UCF freshman guard Darin Green Jr., senior guard Frank Bertz and redshirt junior guard Ceasar DeJesus were able to show their abilities and scored 23 of the Knights 41 second-half points.
