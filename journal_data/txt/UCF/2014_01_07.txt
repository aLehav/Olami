A former Miss Venezuela, beauty star and UCF graduate was shot dead in South America, police told media Tuesday. 
According to Reuters, assailants killed Monica Spear, 29, and her ex-husband Henry Berry, 39, after an attempted robbery on a highway between central Venezuela.
The 2004 Miss Venezuela winner lived in the United States but was vacationing in Venezuela, Reuters reports. The pair’s 5-year-old daughter survived the attack, but with a bullet wound in her leg, Reuters reports.
Spear, who was crowned Miss Venezuea in 2004, was named “fifth most beautiful woman in the universe,” before graduating from UCF with a bachelor’s degree in theater.
Reports indicated Spear’s car may have broken down before armed robbers approached. A five-year-old child survived the incident, Reuters reports.
