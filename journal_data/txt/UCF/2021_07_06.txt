Former UCF student, Emily Rose Bromberg, passed away on Tuesday, July 6, 2021, of cancer according to an Instagram post made by her brother, Dylan Bromberg. 
Bromberg was a member of the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority and sweetheart of the Sigma Chi fraternity at UCF, as stated in their Instagram posts dedicated to her. 
Bromberg’s brother states in the Instagram post, “Around 5 am Emily passed away. Our family was right by her side, and she calmed us with her beautiful, soft-toned voice. She was more concerned about us than she was herself in such a difficult situation. ” 

A GoFundMe organized by Bromberg’s aunt, Amanda Bromberg Calta, states that she was diagnosed with Stage 2b Melanoma at the age of 15. She was monitored with no reoccurrence for five years.  






On the fundraiser website, Calta says, that the Melanoma had spread to Bromberg’s brain, lungs, bones, muscles, and pancreas in May of 2019 while she was attending UCF. 












She was then diagnosed with Stage 4 and battled with the disease for three years.






Bromberg was working as a personal trainer and a cycling instructor in Orlando, Florida. 













Knight News has reached out to the Bromberg family offering the chance to share a statement and will update this story if we hear back.
