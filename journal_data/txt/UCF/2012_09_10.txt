As Fraternity Rush week draws to a close, KnightNews.com has learned of the recruitment numbers for several of the fraternity’s before their official release.
From what we have gathered, Fraternity new member numbers are down from previous years. This goes for sorority numbers as well.
We can only guess at the reasons behind these lower than normal numbers however, several factors over the past year surely can be attributed to the decrease in Greek Life participation.
Tuition hikes in the past year alone are causing more and more students to seek alternate ways to aid payment and this includes less extra-curricular activities such as Greek Life. This summer, SGA President Cortez Whatley pushed to raise UCF’s tuition by 15%, eventually winning the board over to accept this.
Other reasons that may have contributed to the reduced Greek Life participation include the banning of girls at fraternity rush and last year’s tragic death of Ann Hefferin. Hefferin died of a bacterial infection last August, however, until alcohol was ruled out as a cause of death factor, the fallout brought a dark cloud over the Greek life organizations. Her death also sparked new, unpopular rules and restrictions for UCF Greek Life.
Here are the “unofficial” new member numbers that KnightNews.com has gathered so far:
Phi Delt: 44
Alpha Epsilon Pi: 17
Lambda Chi: 27
Theta Chi:51
Delta Tau Delta: 17
These numbers are unofficial until Wednesday. If you have more info about Fraternity or Sorority numbers text our tip line at 407-5-TIP-UCF!

Update 3 at 6:20 PM, 9/10/12-  UCF Student Union officials confirm it was an accidental pepper spray discharge that caused the building to be shutdown. It’s now reopened.
KnightNews.com talked to students who said it went off in the ladies restroom. Listen to some interviews we grabbed with students there at the time.

Update 2:
The entire UCF student union was blocked off today reportedly due to a large amount of pepper spray that had been released in the building, affecting many students in the atrium.
The building had been blocked for several hours, mid-afternoon today. Many police officers were present, as well as about four firetrucks and other emergency vehicles, and five or so police cars. Three helicopters were seen hovering over the entire campus.
All students were evacuated from the building as soon as the incident was known. Another test was said to be done to determine if the area is safe or not, and if it is, the building will re-open. No other details are currently known, as far as how many were affected and such, but an update will be on its way as soon as possible.
More information can be found by calling Community Relations 407-823-2165 tomorrow, for a more detailed recap of the event, according to Randy Sulter, a Patrol for UCF’s Public Safety and Police.
