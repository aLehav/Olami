A new documentary has taken over the web this week shedding light onto a, until recently, relatively unknown subject matter.
Kony 2012 is a film and campaign that is aimed at bringing awareness to Joseph Kony by making him famous, “not to celebrate him, but to raise support for his arrest and set a precedent for international justice”. The film promotes an end to terrorism in Uganda and more specifically the kidnapping of children to be used as army soldiers.
Joseph Kony is the leader of a Christian terrorist group the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). The film focuses on the plight of one Ugandan man, Jacob, who is a former soldier of the LRA. The film also provides a series of steps and information to people around the world as to what they can do to help bring awareness to this situation.
The video has been watched nearly 2.5 million times in just under three days and the Kony 2012 Facebook campaign has surpassed their 500,000 “Share” goal, reaching over 3.5 million shares already.
The campaign aims to gain support from people around the world, especially U.S. government officials and celebrities who can help spread the word. Celebrities like George Clooney, Rihanna and Ellen DeGeneres have already pledged support regarding the matter.
The documentary has also called on supporters to act on April 20, 2012.
