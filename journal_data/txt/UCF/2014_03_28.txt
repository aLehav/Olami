The University of Central Florida is looking into the possibility of expanding the campus into downtown Orlando, according to FOX 35.
UCF already has educational facilities in downtown Orlando, with the “Executive Development Center” on Pine Street for students pursuing their MBA and the “Center for Emerging Media” that focuses on cutting-edge technological developments.
“We’re a metropolitan research university,” says Chad Binette, Director of News  and Information for UCF. “So it only makes sense that we would look at whether  it might be beneficial for us to move some of our programs into downtown  Orlando,” Binette told FOX 35.
UCF could begin work on expanding downtown as early as this summer, pending approval of the $2 million in their budget from the Florida Senate.
