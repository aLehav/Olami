Florida State Representative and UCF Alumnus Amber Mariano announced to the Florida community and Florida Bright Futures Academic Scholars new legislation that will cover 100% the cost of tuition beginning Fall 2017.
Students that received the Academic Scholars tier of the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship program – the highest of three – will benefit from the bill.
According to Mariano, all incoming and current Academic Scholars receive 100% tuition coverage, including the Summer semester, and a $300 stipend for textbooks.
“It was such an honor to advocate and vote for this legislation during my first Session serving in the Florida House of Representatives,” Mariano said. “We are making huge strides toward keeping the best and brightest students in Florida!”

Florida Academic Scholars previously earned $103 per credit hour. The cost of tuition per credit hour for in-state students currently resides at $212 at UCF. Bright Futures Medallion Scholars receive $77 per credit hour.
Coverage for Summer semesters begins Summer 2018. Bright Futures Medallion Scholars and Gold Seal Vocational Scholars receive the standard amount.
