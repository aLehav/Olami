It hasn’t been made public how this list made it through the NTSB(National Transportation Safety Board), but according to KTVU the NTSB approved this list of obviously fake names as the pilots on the Flight 214 crash.
UPDATE: The NTSB released the following statement regarding the mishap:
“The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6.
Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft.
The NTSB does not release or confirm the names of crewmembers or people involved in transportation accidents to the media. We work hard to ensure that only appropriate factual information regarding an investigation is released and deeply regret today’s incident.
Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated.”
On Friday, KTVU, a San Francisco news station, read off this list of names as the pilots on the Asiana Flight 214 crash. See the video below:
