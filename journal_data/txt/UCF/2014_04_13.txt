Back in February, at the UCF signing day event, Head Coach George O’Leary began to build anticipation for the 2014 spring game by claiming that he had a “real big announcement” to make, and that only those at the game would have access to the information.
In an attempt to shine a spotlight on the annual exhibition that is largely unattended, O’Leary emphasized that the best way to show support for the BCS Victory was to pack the house for the spring game.
He did not break any new ground in front of the small following that showed up at Bright House Networks Stadium.
“I really did want to make the announcement today,” O’Leary claimed after the game, “but I couldn’t because of the sparse crowd.”
Pressed about what the announcement might be, he fended off any real insight as to what it may pertain to, instead continuing to rally the fans to fill their house.
“I wanted to make it too today. Everyone keeps asking me about that,” he said. “But you know, the big thing is… remember what I said, when we had that big thing in the arena? If you really want to show your support for the Fiesta Bowl, is to pack the spring game.”
It seems that either O’Leary is tantalizing this fan base to increase attendance, or this upcoming announcement is nothing shake a stick at. Consider that the only circumstances by which this ‘real big announcement’ will happen is in front of a full stadium of the Black and Gold faithful, lending to the assumption that this news will not lack significance.
For certain, O’Leary is not going to drop his statement in front of anything he considers beneath the magnitude of his declaration.
“Next time the stadium is filled I’ll make the announcement,” he said.
This means we will have to wait until at least the September 20 game against Bethune-Cookman, the Knights’ first game at home this season. If not then, the BYU game at home on October 9 seems the next best bet.
Until then, O’Leary has us all on the edge of our seats.
