In Rick Scott’s latest effort to show he is adamant about not raising tuition for the 2013-2014 school year, he created a petition on his Facebook page which you can see here.
The caption on his Facebook post reads, “With a 125% increase in tuition over the last 10 years, it’s time to say enough!”
Scott’s venture to end tuition increases came roughly two weeks ago when he vetoed a 3% tuition increase that was passed by state lawmakers. Currently, there could still be a 1.7% tuition increase due to a provision that allows tuition to increase automatically to keep up with inflation if the legislators don’t increase the tuition themselves.
More recently, Gov. Scott sent out an e-mail to all Florida public universities and was very clear in his e-mail that even though there are several legal opinions on who would be implementing the tuition increase, Scott will be committed to fighting any type of tuition increase.
