Every year, the sisters of Zeta Tau Alpha come together in efforts to raise money towards breast cancer education and awareness, their national philanthropy.
Zeta Tau Alpha also hosts a dance competition every year where other Greek organizations can participate in hopes of bringing home the first place trophy and bragging rights until the next year, all while raising money for an excellent cause. 

This year the dance competition will be held on October 1 at the CFE Arena at 7 p.m., doors will open an hour prior to the start of the event. 
Leading up to the event, Zeta Tau Alpha will be hosting a variety of other events to raise money for their philanthropy. 
On Monday, September 28, they will be hosting a car wash from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. at the Kappa Sigma fraternity house located at 4322 Greek Park Drive, Orlando, Florida 32816.
Tickets to attend the competition will be sold for five dollars at the ZTA Kiss Away tabling on Tuesday and Wednesday from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. outside of the UCF Student Union. 
Students who are participating in the competition can also donate through tilt and receive points for their team by doing so. 
The Eta Kappa chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha raised over 22,000 dollars last year and are shooting for 40,000 dollars this year.
The sisters of Zeta Tau Alpha encourage all students to attend the competition regardless if they involved in Greek life or not, as well as stop by the car wash and Kiss Away tables.
Video replays of all dance routines will be available on KnightNews.com after the competition.
