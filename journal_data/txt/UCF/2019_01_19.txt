A UCF student is in critical condition after being struck by a vehicle near campus on Thursday night, according to multiple reports.
Troopers say at about 9:55 p.m., 19-year-old Mariana Bornacelli was running across the street near the intersection of Alafaya Trail and University Boulevard when she was struck by a four-door Nissan, News 6 reported. She was not at a crosswalk or intersection when she entered the vehicle’s path, according to News 6.
Bornacelli was transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center in critical condition, according to a Go Fund Me being shared by several Greek students. 
The driver of the Nissan, 24-year-old Sultan Alanazi, was not injured and is not facing charges at this time, News 6 reported. Authorities have determined that alcohol was not a factor in the incident, according to News 6.
The GoFundMe page Knight News discovered states it was created in Bornacelli’s name to “help relieve her family of the stress of medical bills.”
Knight News received a statement from the GoFundMe organizer and childhood friend of Bornacelli, Valerie Calderon.
“We all met Mariana in middle school and ever since then we all have continued growing in our friendship with her. She is one of our closest friends, Calderon said in an email. “We’ve truly been together through thick and thin. Mariana is a beautiful person inside and out. We know she’s going to be able to pull through this.”
Calderon’s fundraising efforts are supported by her and two other lifelong friends of Bornacelli: Savannah Summers and Patricia Arance Sanchez.
