Despite UCF falling to Rice in the C-USA Tournament last week 4-2 they landed a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
The last time UCF made it to the NCAA Tournament was back in 2004 when they beat Oklahoma State 7-3 in the first round but lost to Florida State in the second round 3-2.
Now it’s 2011 and UCF may get a chance to go against FSU again in Tallahassee if they can make it past Alabama this Friday.
