DisneyQuest at Downtown Disney will close next year and will be replaced with an NBA-themed attraction, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
The five story virtual reality entertainment center opened in 1998 and was planned to be one of many worldwide chain video game hubs. However, due to smartphones and an era of technological times, DisneyQuest started to seem outdated to many people, according to the Sentinel.
Chris Fouche told the Sentinel, “Now it seems really stupid and really cheesy. I have more power in my phone than in that whole building.”
The most popular attraction has always been the cyberspace mountain roller coaster simulator. The experience is rather expensive. One-day tickets for adults cost $47.93 and $41.54 for children.
The company stopped selling its combination annual water-park-DisneyQuest passes Monday, according to the Sentinel.
The NBA Experience at Downtown Disney will include high-tech experiences, a restaurant and a store, according to the Sentinel.
