UCF fraternity members are trying to earn Zeta Tau Alpha’s “King of the Campus” title–all in the name of raising breast cancer awareness.
A member of Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi and Sigma Pi all tested their might at the final event, the pageant show, before the “King of the Campus” is announced on Sunday.

Kappa Sigma’s Josh Thompson and Phi Delta Theta’s Sean Morse both won the pageant, splitting four of the awards the sorority gave out. However, there will only be one “King of the Campus” announced Sunday.
The fraternity members running for “King of the Campus” have spent weeks participating in philanthropy events to help raise money for breast cancer awareness. The fraternity brothers have been awarded points based off of their contributions to the cause throughout the multiple-week competition. 
Zeta Tau Alpha’s Lauren Whitley told KnightNews.com that the sorority has raised over $25,000 for breast cancer awareness through their events. 
“I think the event was one of our more successful events. It’s following our lip sync event which is one of the biggest events in Greek Park,” said Whitley.
