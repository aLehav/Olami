As Orlando recovers from Hurricane Irma, the University of Central Florida has decided to cancel the Knights’ home football game this Saturday versus Georgia Tech, according to UCF.
Instead of hosting Georgia Tech this weekend, UCF will instead be hosting nearly 1000 national guardsmen as the city recovers from the storm.
“We’re honored to host the National Guard and play a part in helping our community and state recover from Irma,” said Vice President and Director of Athletics Danny White. “On behalf of our student-athletes, athletics staff and fans, I promise the Knights will do everything we can to assist in recovery efforts.”
The UCF home game, which was scheduled to be played at Spectrum Stadium this Saturday, will be the second consecutive game the Knights had to cancel because of Hurricane Irma. There is no word yet on if the games will be rescheduled.
UCF has canceled classes until Thursday September 14.
Fans with tickets to the Georgia Tech game, including season ticket holders, can contact UCF Athletics at 407.823.1000 for information about attending a different game this season.
