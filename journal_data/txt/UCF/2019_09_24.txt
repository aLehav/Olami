UCF Police Corporal Mario Jenkins was shot and killed in the line of duty on Saturday, September 24, 2005.
According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, Jenkins was working at a UCF football game as a plain-clothed officer when he found himself in an altercation with a group of students outside of the Florida Citrus Bowl.
During the altercation, Jenkins’ service weapon discharged, alerting a nearby Orlando police officer. 
The arriving Orlando police officer, unaware of Jenkins’ status as a plain-clothed officer,  shot Jenkins three times, mortally wounding the 29-year-old.
Jenkins served three years with the UCF Police Department and is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. He is survived by his wife and parents.
A statue which rests in front of the UCF Police Department commemorates Jenkins and all officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice.
