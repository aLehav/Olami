The University of Central Florida will be featured this Sunday on “60 Minutes,” in a segment about low-income and first generation students finding success at the university, according to a press release.
The segment will be featured around Bill and Melinda Gates’ visit to UCF in October of 2017, as they learned about how the university helps students succeed and graduate, according to the press release.
The segment will feature “emotional” interviews by CBS anchor Scott Pelley with the Gateses and a group of UCF Gates Scholars, which are students who have their college expenses paid by the Gates Foundation. Pelley also interviews Maribeth Ehasz, UCF vice-president for student development and enrollment services, about the ways that UCF is helping students succeed. The interview with Ehasz will be apart of “60 Minutes Overtime,” an online segment featured on CBS’ website.
“UCF has shown remarkable success in retention and graduation rates among first generation and low-income students. Among out student body of 66,000, 25 percent are the first in their families to attend college, and 38 percent are low-income as defined by federal Pell Grant eligibility,” The press release read.
The segment will be aired this Sunday at 7 p.m. on CBS.
