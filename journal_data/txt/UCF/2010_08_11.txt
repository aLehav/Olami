Playboy Playmate Shanna Marie McLaughlin is not letting critics of her sexy photo shoot in the UCF locker room go unanswered — she’s started her own Facebook fan page and posted a video where she responds to the worldwide attention her shoot has brought UCF football. 

The video was taken during a recent Playboy Golf event in Chicago. 
On her fanpage, McLaughlin, a UCF alumna, asked fans for their opinion on the “controversy” and many have come to her defense. 
“This video is going to do … more to help recruiting at UCF than anything in the school’s history,” wrote Philip Ellison. “They should be thanking you.”
But UCF administrators are doing anything but that. They have apologized to media outlets for the shoot — even though coach George O’Leary reportedly approved it — and have released statements saying they don’t condone the shoot. Some parents have appeared on TV disapproving of the shoot, which comes during UCF’s media blitz promoting a family friendly tailgating environment. 
KnightNews.com has reported how UCF infuriated fans by cutting down on the time tailgating and drinking could happen. Alumni who donate $1,000 to the University are able to buy some of the privileges back, such as longer tailgating hours. Check out some of the videos on the “related posts” links on the right. 
KnightNews.com has been following McLaughlin since she earned the title of Playboy’s Miss July 2010, and met up with her at UCF’s Knight Library bar where she recently signed autographs. She has told media outlets in the past she hopes to use this recognition, along with her business degree from UCF, to open up doors for her future.
