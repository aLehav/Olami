The UCF Knights are officially ranked higher in the Associated Press poll than they have ever been in program history.
The Knights moved up to No.19 in the Associated Press poll and No.22 in the USA Today Coaches Poll after dismantling the UCONN Huskies 62-17 at Brighthouse Networks Stadium on Saturday.
The Knights continue to hold their own destiny as they look to make the first BCS bowl in program history. Five games remaining against Houston, Temple, Rutgers, South Florida, and SMU separate the Knights from earning the automatic BCS-bowl bid for the American Athletic Conference. If the Knights win out the rest of their games, they will head to a BCS bowl.
The Knights have a bye week before they stay home to take on the Houston Cougars(6-1) in one of the toughest remaining tests of the season.



Update: UCF released the police report regarding the rape as well as a robocall that went out to certain UCF Alert subscribers. Review both below:
