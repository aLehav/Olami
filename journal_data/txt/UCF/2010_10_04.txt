Today is the first day of runoff elections in an unusual campaign week. Usually, SGA elections take place Monday through Wednesday but this week, because of the football game between UCF and UAB this Wednesday, the election is taking place Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
With only several contested seats and a low turnout of only 2,894 voters last week, compared to the 9,401 voters last year, there are only two runoff elections this year. 
The first race is between Omar Williams and Matthew Arbos running for College of Arts and Humanities Seat 3 and the other for College of Sciences Seat 2 between Tyler Smith and Jill Ginsberg. 
The Arts and Humanities Seat 3 election is between two write in candidates who respectfully had 43 people vote in last weekâ€™s races with Omar Williams taking 45.45% of the vote and Matthew Arbos taking 29.5% of the vote.
The College of Sciences Seat 2 election is between Tyler Smith an incumbent and independent and Jill Ginsberg a member of Speaker Popes ticket. Last week this seat had the largest voter turnout bringing in 497 votes and is most likely going to have the higher turnout of the two races.  
In years past, it was more likely for the bigger ticket to breeze through elections but this year out of the 7 contested races mostly independents and a small Education ticket called EDU run by Senator Eric Katz took out candidates in the Speaker Popes ticket.
