The University of Central Florida has a full day of festivities planned for Saturday’s game versus the Cincinnati Bearcats — but of most it will have to be enjoyed sober, according to the college.
UCF will not lift its open container policy until 2 p.m. This means that no one can drink alcohol on campus until then.
Alcohol consumption will not be allowed when Memory Mall opens at 6 a.m., and when the College Gameday Broadcast takes place on campus, based on this policy.
“The open container waiver will take effect at 2 p.m., which is the usual policy on a Saturday game day,” said UCF Assistant Vice President Chad Binette. “Alcohol will not be allowed until that time.”
While some students may not be pleased about the dry campus, others believe it’s a good decision that will put UCF in a positive light.
“I actually think I agree with keeping campus dry until two,” Pi Kappa Phi President Ricky Bohm said. “We’re going to be at the center of the college football world on Saturday, which naturally means there’s going to be more eyes on us than usual. Especially this being the first time we’re hosting Gameday, it would be really unfortunate if people behaved poorly and hindered our chances at hosting it again in the future.”
As Knight News previously reported, the Knights will take on the Cincinnati Bearcats in a match up that will be broadcast nationally on ABC at 8 p.m.
The Knights are currently ranked number 11 in the AP poll. If UCF wins this Saturday, the Knights will extend their win streak to 24 games.
UCF is the 71st different school to host College GameDay and Orlando is the 83rd different city to host the show during its 25-year tenure, according to the college.
Knight News will be on campus all day Saturday giving away national championship t-shirts and Knight News newspapers.
