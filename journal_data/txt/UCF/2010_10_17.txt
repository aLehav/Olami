Saturday, Concert Knight, was definitely the kick off to Homecoming week that students needed to get pumped! Corey Smith started up the show with some of his most popular songs and satisfied the country fans in the crowd. But, let’s be honest, LMFAO and Ludacris are what the students were really waiting for. 

Knights went wile when LMFAO came on. Known for their outlandish attire, the music group came out in zebra pants and bright neon accessories. Also known for being heavy drinkers, it was clear that LMFAO was here to party. They continuously took shots on stage (quite appropriately during their hit song “Shots”) and even showered the crowd with drinks. 
Students had been waiting patiently all night to finally hear Ludacris and began chanting “LUDA” to get him on stage. Ludacris performed a wide array of songs, ranging from his older hits (“Fantasy”, “Move Bitch”, etc.) that he claimed the ‘true fans’ out there would recognize; to some of his more current hits like “My Chick Bad” and “How Low”. 
All 3 performers gave the Arena an unforgettable show with lots of energy. Students definitely left the concert impressed; and countless, positive facebook statuses can account for that.
