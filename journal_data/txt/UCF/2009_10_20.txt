Friends and brothers of John Grosso gathered Monday night to say goodbye at a candlelight vigil on his fraternity’s front lawn.
Grosso, 21, a UCF student and member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, died in a tragic car accident on Oct. 16 on Tanner Road, directly behind UCF.
“I couldn’t believe it, I dropped my stuff and I just walked out and I was in shock,” said Ryan Kaufman, his ATO big brother. “It still really hasn’t hit me. I’m sure it will hit me at the funeral.”
During the vigil, ATO fraternity brothers handed out candles, read from the bible, and allowed friends to come up and speak about John. Many spoke about their personal experiences with him, and how he still influences them every day.
“He brought happiness,” Kauffman said. “Hands down, was the happiest kid I have ever met. Always had a smile on his face, I could be having the worst day, I’d just call him, go over his house, hang out with him, even talk to him on the phone. We had the exact same humor, and that’s why I loved him so much.”
John Grosso’s fun, positive impact he had on his friends and family, is what they say will keep his memory alive.
