A University of Central Florida fraternity’s protein powder turned their gains into a suspicious situation.
Orange County Fire Rescue tweeted earlier today that a suspicious “white powder” was found at Greek Park Dr.

When KnightNews.com got to the scene, OCFR and UCF Police Department, including a hazmat crew, were at the Theta Chi House.
The first test of the substance came back as protein powder, UCFPD spokesperson Courtney Gilmartin said.
A second test was also conducted for caution, which “confirmed that the substance is non-hazardous protein powder,” Gilmartin said.
Theta Chi posted this statement on their Facebook page a few hours after the incident initially occurred.
“Earlier this afternoon a UCF representative conducted a walkthrough of the Theta Chi house. She found a cup of BCAA workout protein powder, incorrectly assumed it was an illegal substance and informed the authorities. It has since been deemed a false alarm and the chemical tests have confirmed it. We have and will comply with all UCF and law enforcement officials in this matter. The gentlemen of Theta Chi do not promote the use of any illegal substances and are committed to a zero-tolerance policy on the matter.”
