A UCF student is being accused of causing a fatal crash early Saturday morning and has had her blood drawn to test for alcohol, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 
Dana McKinnon, 22, suffered minor injuries in the early-morning crash in Orlando that left one person dead.
The driver of the van, Vinh Vo, 42, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Florida Highway Patrol report. 
Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Kim Montes told the Orlando Sentinel that the test was ordered after first responders suspected McKinnon was impaired.
McKinnon was driving eastbound on Lake Pickett Road near Tanner Road when, for an unknown reason, her vehicle traveled into the westbound lane and struck Vo’s vehicle, according to the FHP report. According to the report, the crash remains under investigation and charges are pending. 
According to the Orlando Sentinel, McKinnon is a UCF student majoring in biomedical sciences in the College of Medicine. 



History was made Saturday at the University of Central Florida after UCF student became the first Knight ever to win an individual NCAA Regional title.
UCF junior Greg Eason took home the title at the NCAA Tempe Regional, held at Arizona State’s Karsten Golf Course. In addition to Eason’s victory, the Knights tied for second as a team to advance to the NCAA Championships for the second consecutive year and the sixth in program history. 
“I picked a lot of good targets and was lucky enough to hit the targets,” Eason said. “I putted really well out there. With no wind, the ball goes a long way out here. I was a little conservative today, but tried to be aggressive as well. I managed to hit a lot of good shots and holed a lot of putts on the first two days.”
The UCF men’s golf coach said Eason has been working and playing well and performed well at the regional event. 
“Greg has been building all spring,” UCF head coach Bryce  Wallor said. “He just continues to play well. He had a great round of golf yesterday and a very steady day today.”
The Knights will move on the NCAA Championship, which will be held May 28-June 2 in Atlanta, Ga.
