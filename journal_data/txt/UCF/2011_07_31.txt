Warped Tour came through Orlando at the Central Florida Fairgrounds last Friday and turned the place on fire! 
Well, it sure felt like is was on fire. Blazing heat beat down on everybody. It was nice to see the security at the barricades helping out the fans with water and food. 
With punk headlines from Against Me! to Less Than Jake is was no surprise thousands of fans flocked the fairgrounds. 
The festival included a wide variety of bands from the laid back ska of The Aggrolites to the  glam metal band Black Veil Brides. 
Orlando natives, There For Tomorrow, rocked the stage too in a action packed performance. 
It was a hot day but the energetic fans and fantastic bands made it well worth the heat exhaustion!
