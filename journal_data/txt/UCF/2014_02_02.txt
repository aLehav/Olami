UCF Student Government Association will be holding their first ever spirit week starting on Feb. 3 and will last until Thursday.
The event will kickoff in the Student Union Atrium from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. where SGA will be distributing Spirit Week t-shirts along with other promotional materials. Students who receive the shirts will be able to participate in Discount Day on Tuesday, where students with the shirts will receive discounts from campus stores.
On Wednesday, UCF will play rival USF at CFE Arena and SGA will be giving out 600 limited-edition basketball t-shirts at their tailgate outside of the Arena. Events at the SGA tailgate will also include music, food and entertainment starting at 4 p.m.
Spirit Week will come to a close with an athlete meet and greet that will be in the Pegasus Ballroom from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Thursday. Not only are UCF athletes going to be in attendance, but special guests from the NFL are also expected to attend the event.



The John C. Hitt Library will be implementing a new system in order to reserve study rooms.
Starting on Feb. 3, students will be able to go online at http://library.ucf.edu/StudyRooms and reserve a study room up to 7 days in advance for a maximum of 2 hours. Previously, students reserved the study rooms on the main floor of the library and often times had to wait before they were able to use the room.
Any UCF student with a valid ID will be able to reserve these rooms online, which include study rooms with a computer, presentation rooms and general study rooms. Graduate students will also still be able to reserve the graduate study rooms.
