One of America’s most popular fast food restaurants is selling guest 12 weeks of deals for only $20.
The University of Central Florida area Chick-Fil-A, located off campus in the Waterford Lakes shopping center, is currently selling a Chick-Fil-A t-shirt that entitles the wearer to a variety of free entrees, sides, and treats throughout the fall semester.
The shirts—which are a dark blue color and feature the words “CHIcken ORLANDO” on the front—are currently on sale at the Waterford Lakes location and can be purchased inside the restaurant or through the drive-thru.

“Wear your shirt as much as you like,” Chick fil A Waterford Lakes wrote in a prepared statement. “But be sure to wear it to Chick-Fil-A Waterford Lakes once a week during the months of September, October, and November 2018. Each week you will receive one free item as listed on the back of your shirt.”
The first week of deals begin Sept. 3. This first week, shirt wearers will receive a free Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich meal—which cost about $6.66, according to Fastfoodmenuprice.com.
In total, purchasing the shirt deal will get you about $51.69 worth of Chick-fil-A, if you redeem every week’s deal.
