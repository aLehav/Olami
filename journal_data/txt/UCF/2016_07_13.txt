The Republican National Convention is less than one-week away, and Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump is expected to announce his Vice President Selection prior to the big event.
Over the past several weeks, Trump’s list of potential VP picks has dwindled down to Indiana Governor Mike Pence, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, according to CNN.
Sources are telling NBC News that Trump plans on holding a public event this Friday, July 15 with his VP selection.
After Trump’s announcement Friday, Knight News will be heading to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and will be bringing you wall-to-wall coverage as it breaks live from Ohio. The following week, stay tuned for coverage of the Democratic National Convention.
