Knight News interviewed Florida House of Representative member Mike Miller at the University of Central Florida where he spoke more on his letter to President Donald Trump and UCF Football.

Miller believes that any team who goes undefeated deserves a visit to the White House to meet the president, not just UCF. As a Florida Gators fan, the House Representative put aside a difference in mascots to give the Knights every opportunity to be celebrated as champions.
Miller watched the Chick-fil-a Peach Bowl with family on New Year’s Day and saw outstanding plays from both the UCF offense and defense. Shaquem Griffin and McKenzie Milton naturally caught Miller’s eye with the explosive athleticism the two played on the field – key roles in defeating Auburn in front of a sold-out crowd in Atlanta.
Stay tuned with Knight News as we cover the UCF Football Championship Parade at Walt Disney World Sunday before the Stagger Inn victory party Sunday night.
