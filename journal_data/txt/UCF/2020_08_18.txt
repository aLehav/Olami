UCF’s dashboard shows 76 positive COVID-19 cases were detected during the first week of the move-in process for on-campus residents.
UCF spokeswoman Courtney Gilmartin said most of the UCF Housing residents who tested positive returned home to quarantine. 
A COVID-19 test is required before checking in, and the dashboard states 76 out of 2,894 tests were positive — a positivity rate of 2.6%. Knight News has not obtained records to independently verify this data but has reached out to UCF for clarification. 
The move-in process officially kicked-off on Aug. 8 — the dashboard states resident assistants began moving in on Aug. 4 with no positive cases reported. 
The university has been made aware of 632 positive COVID-19 cases since March 10 through Saturday, including both on- and off-campus cases, the dashboard shows. 
Knight News previously confirmed the first case was reported to the university on March 10 in June. 
UCF first unveiled its new dashboard on Aug. 12, which showed a total of 540 total cases reported to the university since the start of the pandemic. 
“We encourage students, faculty and staff to report any positive tests to us, whether or not you have been on or plan to go to any of our campuses,” the dashboard reads.
To report positive tests, ask questions about symptoms, and request a telehealth visit to be screened for possible testing, UCF has set up a COVID Line and can be reached at 407-823-2509.
