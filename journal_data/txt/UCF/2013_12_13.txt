Orlando’s UCF Knights beat Tampa’s USF Bulls in the biggest rivalry game this season, and on Friday the 13th, it was time for Tampa’s Mayor Bob Buckhorn to make good on his bet.

Today at 11:30 a.m., Mayor Buckhorn was out on the corner of Franklin Street and Kennedy Boulevard in downtown Tampa in a UCF Knights jersey.
And on that corner, over their Old City Hall, the UCF flag was raised ceremoniously in honor of the Knights’ historic win.

On Thursday, Instagram released a new feature called Instagram Direct, which allows users to privately share photos and videos with up to 15 select followers.
Similar to SnapChat, this is the first time on Instragram that users can share photos/videos without it being all-or-nothing with their followers.
After updating to Instagram version 5.0, users will see a small inbox in the top-right corner where they can find messages they have sent or they are receiving. After sending an item through Instagram Direct, users will be able to see what they sent and the avatars of people they sent it to. Some users may appear gray, meaning that they haven’t opened the message yet.
The update is available on both iOS and Android.
