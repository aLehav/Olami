The American Athletic Conference announced the league divisions for the 2015 season on Friday.
UCF will be playing in the East Division along with Cincinnati, UConn, East Carolina, Temple and USF. The West division Houston, Memphis, Navy, SMU, Tulsa and Tulane.
Teams in the American will play a total of eight conference games per season, with five of them being the teams in their division. The other three games in conference action will come from the other division, ensuring that each team plays each other at least once in a four-year cycle.
The teams with the best record in each division will face off in the American championship at the end of the season. Since there was no divisions in 2013, the Knights won the American outright by having the best record.
