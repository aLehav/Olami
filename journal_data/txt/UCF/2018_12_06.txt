On March 12, 2018, Drake, now 8, was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, or DIPG.
ServPro of DLV began a GoFundMe page to allow the LSU fan to attend the Fiesta Bowl in Arizona on New Year’s Day when they play the UCF Knights. 
While there is no known cure, and DIPG is known as one of the deadliest forms of childhood cancer, Drake’s wish is to watch LSU football in the “opportunity of a lifetime” with his mother.
“Drake is from Vinton, LA and like any good ol’ country boy he likes to fish, hunt, be outdoors, and loves LSU Football!! Drake’s wish for Christmas this year was to receive 190 Christmas cards in the mail. “We would like your help to do much more than that for him. Our wish for Drake is that he be able to attend the upcoming LSU vs UCF Fiesta Bowl Game in Arizona,” said the GoFundMe page.
All proceeds will go to purchasing game tickets, round-trip plane tickets, rental car, and hotel for Drake & his mother, Danielle.
Any money that is donated over the $2,500 will be directly given to the family to help with all of Drake’s medical bills, according to ServPro of DLV.
“This will mean the world to Drake and his family.”



The University of Central Florida is chartering a student’s only flight to get more students to this year’s Fiesta Bowl.
UCF Student Government has partnered with the Rec and Wellness Center, the Student Union, UCF Athletics, and OSI to charter a student’s only plane to Arizona to attend the game.
The 158 students only plane tickets can be purchased tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. at the CFE Arena Box Office for $250 round trip. Students will need to present their UCF IDs and have a valid Knight’s email to purchase a ticket. Each student will only be able to buy one ticket per ID.
