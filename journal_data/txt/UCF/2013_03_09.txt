The Kappa Delta sorority at UCF will be hosting their 5th annual Shamrock walk/run at the Kappa Delta house on Sunday, March 24.
 Proceeds generated from the philanthropy will be donated to Prevent Child Abuse America and locally, Children’s Home Society of Florida, Central Florida Division to help children in need of a safe haven from abuse, young mothers with unplanned pregnancies, parents in need of counseling and much more.
This event is one of the few approved by the University of Central Florida following their decision to suspend Greek Life at UCF for alcohol and hazing related issues. The sorority says they are taking a different approach to this event and are using it as an opportunity to show the UCF community how passionate Kappa Delta is about their philanthropic efforts.
“Besides raising money, this race is about building awareness and shedding some light on children in need or in unfortunate situations– something that isn’t as widespread or as common as some of the other philanthropies throughout the Orlando and UCF community,” the sorority’s philanthropy chair told KnightNews.com
The race begins at 8:00 a.m. with race day registration & packet pick up beginning at 7:00 a.m. Award presentations will follow the race.
Tickets can be purchased through March 23 for $20. Race day tickets can be purchased for $25. All runners will get a shirt. To register online, click here.
