The University of Central Florida has partnered with the Barry University Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law have to offer an all new 3+3 Accelerated Law Program.
According to UCF, the new program will allow qualified UCF students to earn both a bachelor’s degree in legal studies from UCF and a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Barry Law in six years. Typically, students pursuing a J.D. complete a four-year undergraduate program, followed by three years of law school.  
Under the UCF-Barry Law 3+3 program, students will spend three years at UCF and three at Barry Law, completing the requirements for their UCF bachelor’s degree during their first year of law school.
“This partnership with UCF will be a game-changer for the next generation of law students in Orlando,” Barry Law Dean Leticia M. Diaz said following a signing ceremony with Michael Frumkin, dean of UCF’s College of Health and Public Affairs. “Barry Law has had a long and rewarding relationship with UCF, and the school already is well-represented in our student body. The 3+3 program will allow UCF’s most talented students to advance the path to their professional legal careers.”
The program will be the first of its kind in the Orlando area. UCF’s Legal Studies Chair James Beckman said the partnership’s potential is enormous. 
“Barry Law is a popular choice each year for numerous UCF students who desire to stay in Orlando after their undergraduate career,” he explained. “We’re thrilled to be taking steps to solidify our relationship with Barry Law — and our students will definitely benefit from this new partnership in years to come.”
Deans Diaz and Frumkin signed an agreement for the 3+3 program this week. Once formally approved by the universities, the program will be available to students entering UCF in the fall of 2014, UCF said.
