The University of Central Florida Police Department unveiled a new patrol car to display the department’s support for Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and UCF PD’s commitment to keeping impaired drivers off the road, UCF has announced.
The marked patrol car, a Dodge Charger, features a red color scheme to match MADD’s official color and the number “.08” to represent the blood alcohol level considered too impaired for a person to drive age 21 and older.
The department leader in successful DUI arrests, Officer Agustin Gonzalez, will drive the car. The vehicle will be featured at Walk Like MADD, the largest regional fundraiser in support of MADD, according to UCF.
For the first time, UCF will host the walk on April 29 at Memory Mall. Registration starts at 5 p.m. and the event begins at 5:30 p.m.
“Following the walk, agencies from across Central Florida will saturate Orange County with increased DUI patrol and enforcement activities,” UCF Police Chief Richard Beary said.
“In my opinion, drunk driving is a selfish, avoidable crime. It’s important to think about other people before you make that reckless decision to drive drunk.”
