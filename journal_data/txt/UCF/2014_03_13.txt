Isaiah Sykes had a career-high 36 points to go along with nine rebounds as the Knights (13-17) advanced in the first American Athletic Conference tournament.
The ninth-seeded Knights edged the eigth-seeded Temple Owls 94-90 in double overtime to play the top-seeded Cincinnati Bearcats on Thursday night. Isaiah Sykes thought he had won the game for the Knights with a swished jump shot at the end of regulation, but the ball was still in his hands as the buzzer sounded.
In the first overtime, Sykes had another shot to win the game, but his three-pointer fell short of the basketball, sending the game into double-overtime. The Knights were in another battle in the second overtime, but held the lead with 3:31 remaining in the game and did not give it up.
Will Cummings paced the Owls, scoring 25 points and dishing out 9 assists. Quenton DeCosey scored a career-high 28 points for Temple and Anthony Lee added 17.
The Knights’ Tristan Spurlock had 19 points and Calvin Newell had 13, including the game-clinching free throws at the end of the second overtime.
The Knights will have a tough task Thursday night, taking on the top-seeded Bearcats. If the Knights lose, their season will be over.
