The UCF Women’s basketball team (25-3, 14-1 American Athletic Conference) earned its highest NCAA Tournament seeding of all time on Sunday.  With that, the Knights drew an intriguing first round opponent that the entire state of Florida will want to watch.
After winning both the American Athletic Conference regular season and the AAC Tournament, the Knights were named a 7-seed in the Bridgeport region of the 2022 Women’s NCAA Tournament.
UCF drew in-state rival 10-seed Florida (21-10) for their first round matchup.  The game will be played on Saturday, March 19 in Storrs, Connecticut.  A tip-off time has yet to be determined.
The Knights’ reaction was electric.
Here is @UCF_WBB’s reaction to learning they will be facing 10-seed Florida for their 1st-Round matchup in the NCAA Tournament. #UCF #GKCO https://t.co/025cqUVU0y pic.twitter.com/yLK2oNd64i
The rivals have met 26 times since 1978 – the Lady Knights’ inaugural year — with the Gators winning every single battle.
The last date between the teams occurred on Dec 30, 2015, when the Knights fell 93-79 to the Gators in Jacksonville, FL.
UCF has made the NCAA Tournament seven previous times, but has yet to win a game.
The Knights have a chance to change that against their in-state foe on Saturday.
The winner of Saturday’s game will advance to the Round of 32 to take on the winner of 2-seed UConn vs. 15-seed Mercer.
