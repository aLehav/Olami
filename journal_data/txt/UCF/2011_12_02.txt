The Jaws attraction at Universal Studios Orlando Resort will be closing its tanks on January 2, 2012 “to make room for an exciting, NEW, experience we’re planning for you.” 
The Jaws ride opened in 1990 with the park and is based on Steven Spielberg’s famous Jaws film. Universal Studios released this message from their Facebook page announcing the change:
“We know you love JAWS! and we do too. It has been an amazing attraction and after terrorizing the waters of Amity here at Universal Orlando for 20 years, it’s a VERY important part of our history. So, we’ve got a couple things planned to ensure we always remember and honor it. We know it’s hard to say goodbye, but we can’t express how EXCITED we are about the new, innovative & amazing experience we’re going to be bringing you.”
Several rumors have been opening up on the internet about what will replace the attraction including talks of a Transformers ride, a Hobbit attraction, or a completely new experience. However, an anonymous source says a phase II Wizarding World of Harry Potter is likely to be coming, along with the high possibility of a link that would connect Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure in some way. It is said that the Amity Island portion of the park will contain rides, shops and restaurants.  
All this expansion news follows an announcement that a Harry Potter attraction will be heading west to Universal Studios Hollywood and will open sometime in the next couple of years.
We await news from Universal Studios regarding the changes but it seems with the new owners in hand the park is sure to see many upgrades.
