Tuesday marked one of the final rounds of orientation for the incoming freshmen in the class of 2018.
Fall orientations for the class of 2018 wrap up between August 12 and 15.
It was the athleteâ€™s orientation and our reporter, Justin Levy, came across a tight-lipped young athlete at the orientation. As always, hilarity ensued when Justin tried digging deep into the issues. 
Check out the video below:




The UCF Police Department has received reports over the past month of a fraudulent check cashing scheme making its way around campus.
UCFPD says that suspects are approaching individuals around campus and saying that they do not have checking accounts and need help cashing a check. The suspects are then offering a substantial amount of money to the victim for cashing the check.
The suspects are using forged checks, which makes the victim accountable for the withdrawn funds. 
UCFPD is warning students to not cash checks from strangers and give or accept rides to the bank with them.
If you witness suspicious behavior, report it to the UCF Police Department at 407-823-5555.
