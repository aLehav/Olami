KnightNews.com talked to Sgt. Williamson, a UCF Police Spokesman, who wanted to warn people “never to leave your personal belongings that are valuable in your car.” He went on to say that putting them in your trunk may not also be the safest idea because crooks may be able to find a way to open it up.
UCF is located in Zone 22C of East Orange County which sees the highest auto burglaries in the area.

Williamson also said that this time last year there was also a number of car burglaries at UCF but through “plain clothes” operations they were able to stop them.
It is expected that their will be a large police presence at UCF for the first couple of weeks of school.
