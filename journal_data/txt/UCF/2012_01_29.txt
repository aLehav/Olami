The Florida Federation of College Republicans held a presidential primary straw poll at its spring quarterly meeting — and Mitt Romney won big. 
Romney earned 47.62 percent of the vote. Ron Paul was second with 23.81 percent, Rick Santorum was third with 14.29 percent and Newt Gingrich got only 9.52 percent of the vote, according to a press release sent by Ryan Heffner of the FFCR.
There were eight chapters in attendance — Eckerd, FAU, UCF, UF, USF, UWF, UM — along with five FFCR executive board members present for the vote.

This Saturday, the Advance Auto Parts Monster Jam came to the Orlando Citrus bowl. The sold out show included several prominent Monster Trucks including Maximum Destruction, Captain America, Grave Digger The Legend, driven by Adam Anderson, and The Grave Digger itself, driven by well known Monster Truck Champion Dennis Anderson. 
Monster Jam consisted of 1,500 horsepower, 10,000 pound monster trucks competing in side by side racing and freestyle competitions. The freestyles included plenty of wheelies, jumps, donuts, and of course, crashes and destruction!
