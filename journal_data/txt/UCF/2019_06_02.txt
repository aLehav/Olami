Anyone getting a new phone number in the area may not be recognized as a local number, thatâ€™s because Central Florida is getting a new area code. 
Starting June 4 all new cellphone or landline numbers in Orange, Osceola or Seminole counties will have a 689 area code, according to a WESH 2 News article. 
The 407 and 321 area codes are running out of numbers according to officials, the article stated. Some parts of Lake and Volusia counties will also get the new area code. 
Current customers will not be affected.
Florida Public Service Commission approved the change last year for our fast growing area, the article stated.
