April 15 marked the date of the Interfraternity Council’s inaugural “Wackadoo’s Fatass Burger Challenge” at Wackadoo’s Grub & Brew in the UCF Student Union, chaired by the IFC’s community service chairman Tyler Rits.

Different fraternities sent delegates to compete in this hour-long eating contest where contestant must eat a five-pound meal consisting of two one-pound burger patties and a pound of pulled pork, stacked on a bun with nine slices of cheese and nine slices of bacon, all on a tray with one pound of frech fries.
With around a dozen contestants, only one emerged victorious int he contest. Lee Smith, a brother of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, was crowned the first “Fratty Fatty” of 2011, having eating the entire meal in approximately 40 minutes. Lee was also the winner of several eating contests in 2010, including Fubar’s “Fubarger Challenge,” as well as El Corral’s “Empanada Eating Contest.”
The event was set to raise money for Freedom Ride Orlando, a therapeutic horseback riding center. There was a bucket representing each contestant, and money was thrown into each in order to support fellow fraternity brothers.
With more than 100 in attendance, IFC President Adam Brock says he is excited to see the event grow even bigger in years to come.
