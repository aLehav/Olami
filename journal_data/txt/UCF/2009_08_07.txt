President Bill Clinton will come to UCF Sunday to speak to students in the Pegasus Ballroom of the Student Union.
Clinton will address more than 300 high school and college students from around the state taking part in the Lawton Chiles Leadership Corps. program.
“This exciting initiative, which is being organized by The Lawton Chiles Foundation and co-chaired by Sen. Mel Martinez, Sen. Bill Nelson, and former Sen. Bob Graham, will mobilize Florida’s high school and college students, harnessing their passion to improve the way Florida educates and cares for its children,” according to a release on lawtonchiles.org.
The group is fighting for issues important to Florida’s youth — like improving graduation rates and providing more health care for children.
The event is free and open to the public and begins at 1 p.m.
An overflow room with monitors will be set up once the 850 seats in the Pegasus Ballroom are filled.
Clinton is expected to speak by 2 p.m.
This is Clinton’s first UCF visit since he campaigned for President Obama last year.
