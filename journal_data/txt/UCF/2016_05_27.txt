The University of Central Florida Police Department will be joining the Orange County Sheriff’s Office and other local law enforcement agencies as part of a concentrated effort to keep impaired drivers off the road this Memorial Day Weekend, according to a press release issued by the university.
The multi-jurisidictional partnership will begin at 8 p.m. and run through 4 a.m. Saturday.
Drivers suspected of being impaired will be pulled over and asked to complete a sobriety test. Inebriated drivers will be arrested. Those under 21 who are found to be intoxicated will face a one-year license suspension, even if they are under the limit.
Those who wish to indulge in the festivities are encouraged to either find a designated driver, use ride-sharing apps such as Uber or Lyft, or call a taxi. However, as a last resort, AAA and Budweiser will also be partnering for a “Tow To Go” program.
This service, available to AAA members and non-members alike, hails a AAA tow truck to your location. The driver will tow your car and give you a ride anywhere within a 10-mile radius. To use this service, call (855) 286-9246.
