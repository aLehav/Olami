UCFPD arrested 20-year-old UCF student Leah Duthil after allegedly attacking one of her neighbors in the UCF-affiliated apartment complex, The Pointe at Central.
After a night of punching a neighbors’ door, trying to escape from handcuffs and passing out in a patrol vehicle, Duthil was booked on charges of burglary of an occupied dwelling with assault or battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly intoxication, the report states.
Police officers first arrived to the scene after hearing reports of a female screaming. After speaking with Duthil, whose speech was slurred and had trouble standing, the cops found there was no crime, the report alleges.
According to the report, after the police left, they stayed in the area and noticed Duthil punching an apartment door.
When police went to investigate, they found that Duthil allegedly pushed her way into the apartment, and shoved a woman in the chest for calling the police on her.
It was then that police saw Duthil running down a nearby staircase and ignored police when they ordered to talk to her, the report alleges.
The police chased and Duthil eventually stopped, but refused to get on the ground, the report alleges. The police had to use multiple restraint techniques to get Duthil on the ground and into the patrol vehicle, the report states.
According to the report, after passing out in the patrol vehicle, Duthil was awoken by police using a “sternum rub”. She regained consciousness and began screaming and acting irrationally again before being booked at the station, according the report.
