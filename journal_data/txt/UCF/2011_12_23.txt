Video from across America shows crowds of people waiting in line — and in many cases fighting — before stampeding into shopping malls to try and score pair of $180 shoes. 
Across the country, some shoppers fired guns, others broke broke down doors while yet another crowd of shoppers had to be pepper sprayed to put a stop to the chaos.

The shoes are limited edition Nike Air Jordan sneakers that first came out in 1996. 
Of course Michael Jordan doesn’t play anymore, but his sons Marcus Jordan and Jeffrey Jordan are playing basketball at UCF. 
The black and white shoes are officially named “Air Jordan XI Retro Concords.”
