Family and friends of UCF student Chelsea Torres, who died in a tragic car accident on her 21st birthday, will be able to say goodbye at a memorial service set for Wednesday.
“All family and friends are welcomed as we celebrate the life of Chelsea,” a facebook event for the memorial service states.
The service will be held at St. Luke’s Methodist Church at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday. The church is located at 4851 South Apopka Vineland Road in Orlando.
According to the facebook event, “Her family asks that everyone wear bright colors in remembrance of her amazing personality. (her favorite color was lime green)”
KnightNews.com reported earlier this week that Torres’ roommate told us Torres was not drunk before the crash on that foggy Sunday morning. Orlando police, however, have yet to release their official findings about what may have led Torres to drive the wrong way.
Torres was a Rosen College of Hospitality student at UCF.
