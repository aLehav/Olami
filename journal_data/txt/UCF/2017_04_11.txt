An expansion to the CREOL building on the East side of campus will see the project take place over three stories on a $6.5 million budget.
According to UCF officials, the first floor will be auditorium and mechanical space and the upper two floors will have laboratories and offices.
The CREOL building holds the College of Optics and Photonics for UCF.
“Optics and photonics is the science and technology of light: lasers, LEDs, LCDs, optical fibers, and imaging systems for applications in industry and medicine,” according to the college.
Construction will begin in Summer 2017 and finish in 2018.



Boar’s Head has opened at the University of Central Florida Student Union in place of two concurrent restaurant closings that occurred early in the semester.
In Spring 2017, Huey Magoo’s and Asian Chao closed due to repeated failed health inspections, leading to the termination of their lease.
To act as a ‘pop-up’ restaurant for Huey Magoo’s and Asian Chao, Boar’s Head will remain until the lease to a new, permanent restaurant begins as part of UCF and Aramark’s plan to overhaul the Student Union in a multi-million dollar renovation.

Hours and a menu for Boar’s Head have been provided:




Knight News has communicated with the UCF News & Information Office for more on the opening.
“Aramark met with leaders from Student Government to have a discussion about what they would like to see for the short term concept in that space,” said Mark Schleub, senior communications coordinator.
“Boar’s Head was a great selection because it filled the desire for fresh and healthy options and it was an easy transition for the existing setup. It will remain open until we have the new restaurants in phase one of the food court expansion complete.”
