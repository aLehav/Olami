Just eight days after scheduling a 2-for-1 series with Florida, UCF announced the Knights are slated to play a home-and-home series against the Big Ten’s Maryland Terrapins, beginning in 2025.
The first matchup of the two-game series is scheduled to be played on Aug. 30, 2025, at the Terrapins’ home in College Park, Maryland. 
The second installment of the series will be played at UCF on Sep. 9, 2028, UCF Athletics said. 
“Maryland represents another strong series for UCF against a Big Ten opponent,” UCF Director of Athletics Terry Mohajir said. “These will be attractive intersectional matchups for fans of both programs.”
These will be the third and fourth times the two teams will have ever met, as the all-time series is currently split at one game apiece. Maryland took the first game in 2016 by a score of 30-24 in Orlando, while the Knights took game two with a commanding 38-10 win in Maryland in 2017.
