Polling opened for students to vote for Student Government senators in their respective colleges Monday. The elections will run through Wednesday  at 5 p.m.
Polling stations were setup on the patio in front of the Student Union, Memory Mall, the Recreation and Wellness Center, UCF Downtown, Rosen campus and online. Students can vote at the polling stations from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Students will be voting by logging onto MyUCF and clicking on the SG logo. Voting online is available from 5 a.m. to 12 a.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m to 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
Each student can only vote for senators in their own college. Students may also put in their name as a write-in candidate. UCF interim President Thad Seymour took to Twitter to encourage students to vote.

Students voting at the polling stations can get freebies such as t-shirts, cozies, lanyards, socks and frisbees. SG staff at polling stations on the main campus reported that they are out of t-shirts Tuesday.
The SG website indicates that there will be a voter guide for candidates but there was no information on the website except for candidate names. Forrest McClellan, senate president pro tempore, said candidates are responsible for promoting their campaigns and informing students about their platforms.
There were 55 candidates from 10 colleges and Nicholson School of Communication and Media, running for senate.
Election results will be announced Wednesday at 9 p.m. in the Student Union atrium,  McClellan said.
