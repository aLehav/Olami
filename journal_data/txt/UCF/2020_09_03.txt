UCF will travel to face the ECU Pirates on Sept. 26 for the Knights’ second game of the season, but ECU Athletics announced Wednesday the game will be played with no fans in the stands due to COVID-19 safety precautions. 
ECU Director of Athletics Jon Gilbert said the athletics department is disappointed to host its first home game without fans, and said the decision was made after consulting with local and state health officials.
“The UCF contest will include only essential game management and broadcast personnel, and a limited number of media members,” Gilbert said. “Parking lots operated by the University and used by fans on gameday will be closed.” 
UCF football’s most recent schedule has been updated to reflect the following changes: 
Gilbert said ECU Athletics is optimistic it will able to host fans in Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium this season, at the appropriate time.
On Aug. 20, Gilbert announced all football activities were suspended after receiving the team’s latest COVID-19 testing results, according to a news release.
On Monday, UCF Athletics announced the Bounce House will allow about 11,000 spectators at UCF football’s home opener on Oct. 3 against the Tulsa Golden Hurricane.  
UCF Director of Athletics Danny White said UCF is currently approved for 25% occupancy in the Bounce House for the first home game, and said he hopes UCF can host more games at some point during the season.
