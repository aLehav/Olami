In their second game of this long April road trip, the Knights (4-3, 18-13) fell to the Memphis Tigers (3-4, 16-13) Friday night, 2-1.
Starting pitcher Ben Lively was stuck with the loss, running into tough luck for the second start in a row after pitching an intense complete. He only walked two batters, struck out five, but allowed two earned runs in the third inning that would prove to be the deciding difference.
The runs came in response to UCF’s productive second inning, in which they scored their only run of the game. Taladay began the inning with an infield single, and was able to score on James Vasquez’s double an out later.
It was the last run the Knights would score, only scraping together two more hits in the game.
Memphis was able to string together a two hits to begin the third inning, putting runners at first and second. Center fielder Ford Wilson laid down a sacrifice bunt that advanced the runners into scoring position, and Lively’s momentary lack of control allowed the runners to score in the same at bat on two wild pitches.
Both pitchers were lights out after the action in the third, neither allowing any ground to be gained. Memphis pitcher Sam Moll improved to 5-2 while pitching seven innings, striking out an incredible eleven batters, walking two and allowing just the one earned run.
Reliever Heith Hatfield pitched the final two frames for Memphis and struck out four of the six batters he faced to collect the save and shut the door on UCF’s night.
The Knights pick back up against Memphis today  at 3 PM for the second game of the series, and will look to improve against their Conference USA rivals.
