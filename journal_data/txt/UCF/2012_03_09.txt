The story KnightNews.com broke Monday about dead birds mysteriously showing up near the University of Central Florida music building is now gaining statewide attention.
WFTV Channel featured the story during its 11 p.m. news last night, reporting “dozens” of dead birds were showing up on campus. Since then, The Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun-Sentinel in Ft. Lauderdale have picked up the story.
After UCF student Tariq Belal first discovered the dead birds, he shot video of them and then called KnightNews.com because he was concerned about whether the birds could pose a health risk to students. KnightNews.com checked with UCF officials, who began investigating the situation.
As we reported last week, UCF officials found the birds don’t pose any danger to the UCF community and believe they have solved the mystery about what’s killing the dead birds. The theory: birds are flying into large glass windows because they see their reflections and become confused.
UCF talked to animal experts who say the phenomenon is common — especially during migration.



Spring Break is the one week of a college students career where they can put the books down mid-semester and go on a week long hiatus.
Whether students head to the crazy Panama City Beach, a tropical place like Key West, or go out of country to Mexico or the Bahamas, classic memories are sure to be caught on camera.
