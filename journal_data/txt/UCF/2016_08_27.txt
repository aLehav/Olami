Senior Justin Holman has been named as UCF’s starting quarterback for week 1.
Holman and the Knights will kick off the season on September 3 against South Carolina State.
Holman has started more games for the Knights than any other quarterback in the last two seasons, but head coach Scott Frost wanted to give each player an equal fight for the starting spot before the season started.
Nick Patti is listed as the No. 2 quarterback on UCF’s depth chart. Patti will be returning as a redshirt senior.
According to the Orlando Sentinel, Frost said on media day that he has no intentions on using a multi-quarterback system and that whoever won the position battle would be the starting quarterback for the rest of the season.
“It’s been exciting, but it’s been focused,” Holman told the Sentinel. “A lot of people see a lot of energy on social media and things like that ,but you don’t see the grind that we’re putting in and the sweat. [We’re] coming in here and doing extra film meetings, but it’s definitely been a focused camp for my guys.”
