To continue the trend of the “New Era” campaign, UCF revealed its newly updated secondary logo via Twitter on Wednesday.
The UCF design team gave UCF Athletics some insight regarding the characteristics of the updated logo.
“Overall, the new Knighthead logo is more expressive, with a straight-on aggressive stare and new intimidating eyes,” UCF Brand Identity Director Emma Schneider told UCF Athletics.
Schneider also explained how some of the logo’s characteristics remained the same.
“Many of the Knighthead logo’s original characteristics still remain,” Schneider continues. “The hair, the upper helmet, and the grills within the facemask are all still there, making it not necessarily a brand-new Knighthead logo, but an updated version that looks more focused and determined,” Schneider told UCF Athletics.
Bringing the updated logo to life will be a six-month process.
The new logo is being released now to retailers for the Fall 2022 semester.  Merchandise with the updated logo will be introduced “as supply chains allow” in the Winter and Spring semesters, per ucfknights.com.
UCF Athletics also revealed its updated brand marks via Twitter on Wednesday.
