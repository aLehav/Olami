Two women were attacked at the Valencia Community College West campus late Wednesday evening, according to a report by WKMG Local 6.
Police told Local 6 that the attack happened Wednesday evening around 9:15 p.m. in the campus parking Lot F near Building 11, and they have few details about the suspect. One victim was said to have been knocked unconscious while the other was punched in the mouth. The attacker is still on the loose, Local 6 reports.
According to Local 6, Anna Wytiaz, 18, and Jenna Mullin, 17, had no idea what the man wanted, but he shouted at them while they were walking in the parking lot. When the attacker suddenly grabbed Mullin and tried to “tug her away,” Wytiaz tried to help, but the attacker punched her in the mouth, Local 6 says. Then, he grabbed Mullin, threw her head against a car and knocked her out. 
“I still wake up screaming, the past couple nights. I can’t go to bed,” Wytiaz told Local 6. “We’re mentally really scarred. Everytime I close my eyes, all I can picture is my best friend being grabbed and sitting there calling 911, scared that she’s not waking up.”
As the man ran away, Wytiaz called 9-1-1, hysterical.
“She’s still unconscious and he’s still out there and I’m here, alone,” Wytiaz told the news station. “I was scared that maybe he was going to come for me. In my head, when I was on the phone, I was like, ‘Please, I hope he’s not coming back to kill us or take us.'”
The women told Local 6 they’re nervous on their own campus and they think walking in pairs saved Mullin’s life.
“I wouldn’t be here today if I didn’t have someone with me,” Mullin told Local 6, who plans to be escorted to her car by campus security after every night class.
The victims were only able to get a vague description of their attacker. They are worried that the man may attack again.
An OPD spokesman told Local 6, officers searched the entire campus area but never found the suspect.
