Billionaire John Goodman is accused of driving drunk after a night at a posh Palm Beach club, plowing his Bentley into UCF grad Scott Patrick Wilson’s Hyundai, then leaving him to die as his car sank into a South Florida canal. 
Goodman doesn't want the jury to see this picture of Wilson in his UCF cap & gownWilson had just recently graduated UCF with a degree in mechanical engineering and was still living in Orlando, about to land his first job. He drove down to Palm Beach that day to celebrate his little sister’s birthday when the worlds of a young college grad and a wealthy polo tycoon violently collided.   
The story has outraged UCF students over the two years KnightNews.com has followed it. The outrage grew with reports that Goodman adopted his own girlfriend in a legal move to protect his estate. 
KnightNews.com is monitoring South Florida media as the Goodman DUI trial continues. Jury selection began Tuesday, and WPTV is reporting Goodman’s attorney made a motion to block jurors from seeing photos of Wilson wearing his UCF cap and gown.
