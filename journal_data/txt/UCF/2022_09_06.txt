Former UCF QB McKenzie Milton, who led the Knights to an undefeated season in 2017 will join the football team’s radio broadcast team for every pre-game show this season. 
UCF’s Director of Broadcast Marc Daniels took to his social media to welcome the former Knight to the broadcast team in which Milton will not only lend his voice to the pregame show on 96.9 The Game before each football game but will also serve as an on-field analyst for select games. 
Thankful for the opportunity Marc & fired up to join the team 🤙🏼 Go Knights & Charge On 😤 https://t.co/8qt5WF1qom
“Thrilled to announce the addition of McKenzie Milton(@McKenzieMil10) to our radio broadcast team,” Daniels said. “KZ will be part of the pregame show before each game and serve as an on-field analyst for select games. Welcome McKenzie and so excited to have you be part of the crew.” 
During his time at UCF, Milton went 27-6 as a starter and threw for 8,755 yards and 72 touchdowns which included an undefeated 2017 season in which the Knights beat Football Head Coach Gus Malzahn’s former team, the Auburn Tigers in the Peach Bowl and were self-declared “National Champions”. 
Milton shared in his excitement saying that the decision to join his former University’s broadcast team was an easy one due to his continued passion for the game and UCF.  
“For me, I love UCF, love watching sports and being around people,” Milton said. “It’s another way of being involved in the game in a different aspect where I’m not involved with coaching right now and working all those hours.” 
Milton said the balance between managing his passions of coaching along with still being involved in the game he retired from just a couple of months ago made it a win-win situation for him going forward. 
“I can still get that kind of improvement in areas like running my quarterback camp in town and commenting,” Milton said. “Mark and I are fed up with our playing days at UCF, so it was a no-brainer to partner with him and with the broadcasting crew at UCF.”  
You can listen to Milton in action this Friday a few hours before the Knights take on the Louisville Cardinals at home at 7:30 p.m.
