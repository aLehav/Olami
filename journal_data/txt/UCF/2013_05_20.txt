UCF was spared a 3% tuition increase along with the rest of Florida’s colleges and universities after Gov. Rick Scott vetoed the hike from the state budget.

On Monday, Scott blocked the tuition hike that was part of the state’s overall budget, around $74 billion.
“I worry about the cost of education,” Scott said in a statement. “I am absolutely committed to keeping tuition low. This is not a political decision; this is a decision for Florida families. Tuition cannot continue to go up the way it’s been going up.”
Universities can still go to the Board of Governors that oversees the State University System to ask for an increase in the so-called “differential” tuition, however, a spokeswoman for the Board of Governors, told the Orlando Sentinel that she does not expect any state university to request a tuition increase because of the funding boosts that are included in the new state budget.
