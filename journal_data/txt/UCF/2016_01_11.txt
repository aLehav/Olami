Looks like a previous Knight football player will be sporting nautical blue, new century silver, red and white.
Former University of Central Florida wide receiver J.J. Worton signed a contract with the New England Patriots Monday, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 
The alumnus has been working with New England’s practice squad in Massachusetts after a contract with the St. Louis Rams expired, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
“New England was one of a handful of teams who originally expressed interest in Worton shortly after his doctor cleared him to compete again following a 2014 knee injury,” the Sentinel said.
Worton placed among UCF’s most successful receivers, completing 168 receptions for 2360 yards and 21 touchdowns through his college football career.
Patriots are making some moves on their practice squad, as rookie WR JJ Worton of Central Florida is in town ready to join the club.
