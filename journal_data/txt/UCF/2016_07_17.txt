Catching them all is becoming dangerous.
Two teens who were playing Pokemon Go were mistaken for thieves and shot at, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
The Flagler County Sheriff’s Office told the Orlando Sentinel that a Palm Coast man was woken up at around 1:30 a.m. when he saw a car parked outside of his home. The sheriff’s office also said that when he went outside to investigate with his handgun, the man heard the two teens say “did you get anything,” thinking they had broken into his home.
Officials told the Orlando Sentinel that the man stepped in front of the vehicle and fired rounds when it took off.
The mother of one of the teens called authorities the next morning and said her “19-year-old son and his 16-year-old friend were playing Pokemon Go on their smartphones when they were confronted by a man who came out of a home and started shooting at them,” authorities told the Orlando Sentinel.
Officials told the Orlando Sentinel that the teens were trying to catch two Pokemon, a Marowak and Tauros.
The newspaper reported that when the teens got home, they decided not to report the incident because they thought “it was someone trying to scare them.”
