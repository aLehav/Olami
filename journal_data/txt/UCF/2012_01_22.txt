UCF’s Spring 2012 Rush Week kicks off Monday, January 23, where men thinking of joining a UCF IFC fraternity get a chance to find out which one is for them.

A kickoff event, where a small group from each fraternity will be present, is set for Monday from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. in the UCF Student Union.

KnightNews.com found out each event being hosted Tuesday, and we published it below, along with a list of each fraternities size and GPA, as of the last UCF fraternity size and grade report. We also provided links to the fraternity websites, after finding them listed by IFC.

The Memory Mall area, the open area in between the UCF Student Union and the UCF Arena, will be filled with tents of members form each IFC fraternity. Unlike the Monday Student Union event where only a small table of members from each fraternity are present, the tent event allows fraternities to bring out their entire brotherhood to meet potential pledges. It runs from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Friday
Each fraternity will have its own wrap up event. By this point, if you haven’t picked a fraternity to join, you should have it narrowed down. Contact each fraternity you’re still considering and find out where and when they’re meeting up Friday night for the last night of rush.

Legendary former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno died Sunday, his family said in a statement, according to ABC News. He was 85. 
According to ABC, his family released this statement:

It is with great sadness that we announce that Joe Paterno passed away earlier today. His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled.
He died as he lived. He fought hard until the end, stayed positive, thought only of others and constantly reminded everyone of how blessed his life had been. His ambitions were far reaching, but he never believed he had to leave this Happy Valley to achieve them. He was a man devoted to his family, his university, his players and his community.
He has been many things in his life – a soldier, scholar, mentor, coach, friend and father. To my mother he was and is her soul mate, and the last several weeks have shown the strength of their love. To his children and grandchildren he is a shining example of how to live a good, decent and honest life, a standard to which we aspire.
