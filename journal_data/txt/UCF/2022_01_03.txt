Former UCF junior QB Dillon Gabriel announced that he will be transferring to Oklahoma University via Twitter on Monday.

The announcement comes less than three weeks after Gabriel announced that he would be transferring to UCLA.  
The junior announced his intent to enter the transfer portal on Nov. 27 — just one day after UCF’s season finale victory over the University of South Florida.
Gabriel’s announcement also comes just hours after current Oklahoma starting freshman QB Caleb Williams entered the transfer portal.
Williams, however, says staying at Oklahoma will remain an option.
Former OU head coach Lincoln Riley’s departure from the Sooners was cited as a reason for Williams’ decision to transfer, according to Yahoo Sports.
