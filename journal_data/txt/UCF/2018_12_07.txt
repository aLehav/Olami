“With a heavy heart, tomorrow night will be the last night for Stagger Inn UCF.”

Bars and restaurants come and go along University Blvd. due to either low demand or high tenant prices. The area has come a long way since its days hosting Knights Library, Pub, and more in a shopping plaza across the street from UCF.

Sports Illustrated ranked the 37 non-College Football Playoff games in terms of their watchability and the UCF-LSU Fiesta Bowl matchup turned out at number one on their list.
“Snubbed from the playoff after another perfect season, UCF will face the biggest threat yet to its winning streak (now at 25 games) on New Year’s Day. The Knights will be fired up to once again prove they can hang with the big boys in the SEC, and LSU figures to be more excited to play UCF than Auburn was last year. No McKenzie Milton is unfortunate, but Darriel Mack Jr. showed he’s no slouch with six total touchdowns in the AAC championship game. His dual threat ability against LSU’s defense—which will be without Greedy Williams but will have safety Grant Delpit and hopefully linebacker Devin White—should be fascinating to watch. This one is a great start to a fun day of football,” said the article.
DO NOT MISS this matchup!
Sports Illustrated named the 2019 @PlayStation #FiestaBowl, between @LSUfootball and @UCF_Football, as the NO. 1 BOWL GAME to watch this season and you can catch it in person!

UCF will face another powerful SEC program on New Year’s Day with the hope of finishing a second flawless season while paving the way to the playoffs in 2019.
“The Knights are a lot more competitive than people give them credit for, and it’s clear that the touchdown-plus line in the Fiesta Bowl is an overreaction to Milton’s injury that bettors can take advantage of,” Sports Illustrated wrote in their bowl preview.
Pick: UCF +7.5
Confidence Level: Very High (on a scale of Low/Moderate/High/Very High/Extremely High)
–
The greatest fact of all is that UCF has a real chance at dominating LSU on the national stage. SEC commentators agree.
The loss of star quarterback McKenzie Milton began doubts that the Knights wouldn’t finish the season strong. Backup QB Darriel Mack, Jr. dispelled those fears by claiming 4 rushing touchdowns against Memphis in the AAC Championship while being responsible for two more in the air. UCF broke free and away from the visiting team, who held a three-score lead, to hold their opponent to 35-3 in the second half and win 56-41.

University of Florida athletics director Scott Stricklin said he would be open to scheduling a football game or series with the University of Central Florida, the Orlando Sentinel first reported, but would not agree to a home-and-home.
“I’d be OK with scheduling them — in the right situation,” said Stricklin. “We haven’t had a spot where we thought this made sense at this point.”
The University of South Florida has an arrangement with UF to include a two-for-one (Florida hosts twice) in 2022, 2023, and 2025. 
Understandably, Danny White protests two-for-one series as unfair for season ticket holders and for the program to concede a home game matchup worth about $2 million to a Power 5 opponent. White instead would want the Knights to be propelled to the equal level of other top-tier universities given the success UCF has had on and off the field, “Beggars can’t be choosers” attitude need not apply.
“We do home-and-homes with like FSUs and Power 5 leagues. We haven’t done any home-and-homes with non-Power 5 teams. I don’t think we would start that,” Stricklin said.
“But I’d love to schedule [the Knights] in a game.”
UCF fans accused Florida of dodging the 25-0 team by playing Michigan in the Peach Bowl for their third meeting in four years. The reasoning behind setting Michigan, whose No. 7 ranking was disputed, with Florida in the Peach Bowl had to do with superiority and geography, according to CFP Chair Rob Mullen.
“People don’t know. They give me a lot of credit,” Stricklin said Friday. “I have more power than I realize, according to them. People are going to say things when they don’t know what they’re talking about and that’s what is happening there.”

Jaguars quarterback and University of Central Florida football alumnus Blake Bortles is expected to be released from Jacksonville following the season’s end, NFL Network reported Friday afternoon.

Bortles led the Jags to not only their first post-season berth in 10 years in 2017 but also a victory over Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Divisional. Jacksonville led and matched Roethlisberger’s touchdown drives to secure a 45-42 win in Pittsburgh, securing a spot at the AFC Championship against New England, where they would fall short of their Super Bowl dreams.
Bortles also led the Knights to their first New Years Six bowl game in the 2013 season with a victory over Baylor in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, a season hailed as one of UCF’s best.
 
This is a breaking story. Stay tuned for updates.
