UCF has released an affidavit revealing that the SGA senator accused by his peers of criminal conduct — a drunken romp on a UCF golf cart — was Jereme Pozin.
The UCF attorneys’ office claimed that the name was supposed to be redacted from the affidavit, and someone redacted the name from most places in the affidavit. The names of several accusers are also redacted on the document released by UCF. However, on page four of the affidavit released to media is Pozin’s name — unredacted. 
In an exclusive interview with KnightNews.com, Sen. Jereme Pozin explained that he believes it is not proper for UCF to release his name to media. 
“UCF has a proper procedure to handle things like this,” Pozin told KnightNews.com. “I think it’s proper for them to redact names. I think they made a mistake.”
During the SGA Senate meeting, a senator who believed UCF had no right to redact student names from the affidavit provided KnightNews.com a copy of it in its unredacted form.
