A candlelight vigil for UCF senior London Harrel will be held at 8:00 p.m. on Friday, June 28 at the UCF Reflection Pond, according to a Facebook event.
Attendees are encouraged to bring memorabilia in London’s honor, “as to send her positive energy for her to fight for her life,” the event page adds.
The UCF candlelight vigil will be held simultaneously with a vigil in her home state of South Carolina, according to the event page.
Harrell remains in a coma at an Orlando hospital after suffering severe injuries from a hit-and-run crash near campus on June 22.
