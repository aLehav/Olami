Michael Phelps beat Ryan Lochte in the men’s 200 meter individual medley en route to receiving his already record breaking 16h gold medal.
The medal was his first individual gold of the Olympics, adding to his 4×200 relay gold, two silvers, and a fourth place finish.  His time of 1 minute, 54.27 seconds was not as fast as his previous winning time in Bejing, but still fast enough to win gold in London.
Lochte received the silver, while  Hungary’s Laszlo Cseh took bronze.
Phelps started off the Olympics slow, barely qualifying for his 400 meter individual medley, but has kicked into gear to make his London olympic campaign an impressive one.
Lochte, who called these Olympics “his time”, failed to receive gold in both his individual events today. However, he still has an impressive two golds in London.
The “one, two” finish by Phelps and Lochte helped propel the United States over China in the total medal count. The United States has 37 medals, while China has 34, in third place is France with 16.
