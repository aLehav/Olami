KnightNews.com has confirmed a tip we received that Charles Millican, the first president of UCF, died this morning in his Central Florida home is unfortunately true. He was 94.
Millican, known to many as “the father of UCF,” was picked by the Florida Legislature in 1965 to help plan and build what was then called Florida Technological University. Since then, the university he started has swelled into the second largest in the nation, and bears the name UCF.
UCF President John C. Hitt is already reacting to this news.
“Martha, I and the university have experienced a great loss,” Hitt said. “Few universities have enjoyed the kind of lifelong passion that Charlie Millican invested in UCF. From my earliest days as president, I have not only enjoyed his friendship but also appreciated his wise and generous counsel.”
A memorial is planned on campus at 10 a.m. Monday, Dec. 13, in the Pegasus Ballroom of the Student Union.
