Three UCF football alumni made appearances in the Divisional Round of the 2021-22 NFL Playoffs.¬†¬†One former Knight had the game of his life.
WR Breshad Perriman, DB Mike Hughes, and WR Gabriel Davis, were all granted the opportunity of performing in the second round of the playoffs.

Let‚Äôs take a look at how they performed.
After a quiet one-catch, five-yard outing in last week‚Äôs win over the Philadelphia Eagles, Perriman did not get the opportunity to suit up in the Buccaneers‚Äô 30-27 loss vs. the Los Angeles Rams due to injury.
Perriman finished the 2021-22 season with 167 yards on 11 receptions.
Hughes recorded two total tackles (one solo tackle) in the Chiefs‚Äô 42-36 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills.
Last week, I mentioned how Hughes had the misfortune of getting ‚ÄúMossed‚Äù by Pittsburgh Steelers‚Äô WR James Washington.

This week, Hughes had another unfortunate play.¬†¬†This time, it was against former UCF teammate Gabe Davis.
Trying to contain his former teammate on 4th and 13 with the game on the line, Hughes fell (literally) for Davis‚Äô crisp rocker-step, leaving him wide open for the touchdown, which gave Buffalo a 29-26 lead with 1:54 remaining in the game.

And now, we‚Äôve got the best for last.
In the most important game of his career, Gabe Davis put up the performance of a lifetime.
In Buffalo‚Äôs 42-36 loss, Davis put up one of the greatest stat lines by a wide receiver in football history.
The Orlando native caught eight passes for 201 yards and four touchdowns.
Davis became the first player in NFL history to catch four touchdown passes in a playoff game.

Two of those touchdowns came in vital moments of the game.
One of them came on a 4th and 13 where Buffalo trailed the Chiefs 21-26 with just two minutes remaining.
This was the play where Davis burned his former teammate with a rocker step en route to his third touchdown of the game.
Davis‚Äô last touchdown contained even more significance.
Down 33-29, Bills‚Äô QB Josh Allen found Davis for the 19-yard touchdown to go ahead 36-33 with just 13 seconds remaining in the game.

This would be the play that put Davis in the record books.
The Chiefs, however, marched down the field and tied the game up with a field goal as time expired.
After this, Davis never got a chance to make more of an impact on the game, as Kansas City scored on the first possession of overtime.
Davis finished the season ranking fifth on the team with 549 reception yards and ranking third with six reception touchdowns.
