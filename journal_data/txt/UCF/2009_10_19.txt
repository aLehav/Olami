At 9 p.m. tonight, the brothers of Alpha Tau Omega will say goodbye to one of their own.
John Grosso died in a tragic car accident early Friday morning. He was only 21.
According to an e-mail we received from a member of ATO, the candlelight vigil will start at 9 p.m. tonight at the ATO house. There is also a facebook event with information.
“Everyone is more than welcome to come and show your love and support,” according to the facebook event page.
KnightNews.com has been in contact with Grosso’s family, and members have posted comments about him on our first story.
“He was a great man and he will be tremendously missed,” wrote Tammy and David Busciglio, Grosso’s aunt and uncle. “Our lives will never be the same without him. These upcoming holidays will never be the same!”
They are asking anyone with pictures of him to e-mail them to Busciglio@me.com. The family hopes to include them in a slide show to be presented during Grosso’s funeral at 10 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 21 at Stowers Funeral Home in Brandon. His viewing is from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. the night before, at the same location.
Grosso’s friends from UCF have also started sharing what Grosso meant to them.
Eddie Hughes, Grosso’s roommate of two years, said they were like brothers — and that Grosso was taken way too soon.
“The only thing I now have to hold on to are the memories of his unmistakable laugh, his incredible sense of humor, his sly little comments, certain looks that were so predictable when you would ask or say certain things to him, but most of all I will never forget was his smile that could take any anger out of the coldest of hearts,” Hughes wrote. 
“I love you John Grosso, and you will forever be in my heart! Rest in Peace Fin and one day I will see you on the other side.”
