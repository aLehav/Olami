UCF is losing its second defensive coach in just over a week’s time.
Defensive backs coach Kirk Callahan, who has been coaching at UCF since 2012, is departing to take the same position on Jim McElwain’s new staff at the University of Florida, according to multiple media reports.
Defensive coordinator Tyson Summers recently left UCF to take the same position at Colorado State, leaving two big holes to fill in George O’Leary’s assistant coaching staff. During Summers and Callahan’s tenure at UCF, they coached Jacoby Glenn to All-American status and led UCF to a top ten ranked overall defense.
Going to the University of Florida will not be completely foreign to Callahan, as he was a defensive graduate assistant there from 2010-11. During that time Florida beat Penn State in the Outback Bowl and then defeated Ohio State in the Gator Bowl.
Callahan is an alumni of Armwood high school located in Hillsborough County, where he has deep recruiting connections the Gators will hope to take advantage of.
