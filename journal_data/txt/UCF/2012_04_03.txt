Up until recently, UCF students were freely using online marketplaces to buy and sell their class notes. Websites such as Notehall.com (owned by Chegg, a college textbook rental service) pay students to post their personally written lecture notes and study guides for cash. However, teachers at UCF are becoming increasingly aware of this and are taking action.
Knightnews.com got in contact with Karisa Workman, an established communications teacher here at UCF, who says selling notes has been especially popular in the Nicholson School of Communication.
“Faculty members are upset with these students,” she said. “The information a teacher presents is their intellectual property, and it’s unfair for students to be selling it.”
She goes on to explain how this could impact students in upcoming semesters.
“Some teachers have called students into their offices individually. Some have changed their class policy. I even get the impression that teachers are complaining to the Office of Student Conduct, which could mean putting students up for academic review,” Workman said.
According to the UCF Rules of Academic Misconduct, “Selling notes, handouts, etc. without authorization or using them for any commercial purpose without the express written permission of the University and the Instructor is a violation [of UCF Rules of Conduct].”
Will we see students being more harshly disciplined for using these online marketplaces in the future? It’s very possible. Knightnews.com will keep you updated as news breaks on this topic.
