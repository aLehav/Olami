Additionally, the area affected by the closure extends from the western side of the Founders Road traffic circle to the eastern side of the Northwest Gate traffic circle.
Ottawa Road and the East Office Building reserved parking lot will also remain closed during the construction period.
Due to these closures,  TTC route 106 buses will be diverted in both directions through The Pond Road, the York University Busway and York Boulevard.
All closed roadways are scheduled to be reopened on September 5 in time for the beginning of the new school year.
