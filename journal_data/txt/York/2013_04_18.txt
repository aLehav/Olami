Toronto Police are looking for a suspect after a woman reported being sexually assaulted on Wednesday, April 17 outside of Vari Hall.
At 4:50 a.m. while walking from the Village towards Vari Hall, a man on a black bicycle followed a woman and proceeded to try to make conversation with her, police say.
When the woman refused, the man sexually assaulted her. She then pushed the man away and he fled on his bicycle.
The victim reported no injury and declined medical attention.
Police describe the suspect as a black male between the ages of 18 and 21, five-foot-six to five-foot-seven inches tall with a skinny build and a “skinny face and nose.” He was wearing a black toque, a dark-brown or black, worn-out, thin winter jacket, dark khaki pants, and black shoes.
York Security Services is looking at video surveillance footage, which they will then pass on to Toronto Police Services.
