Daniel Younis is accused of sexually engaging a 16-year-old boy online and over cell phone
A York volunteer football coach, who was arrested on Thursday, February 21, faces two charges in a child-luring investigation, police say.
More allegations were made against 24-year-old Daniel Younis, as others came forward after the Toronto Police’s press release, the Globe and Mail reports.
Younis is accused of engaging a 16-year-old boy through phone conversations and online chats from December 2012 to February 2013. It is also alleged that the young victim sent photos of himself to Younis through his cell phone.
Younis, who has no criminal record, has been charged with luring a child under 18 and attempting to make child pornography.
At the time of the arrest, Younis was a volunteer recruiting coordinator and running back coach for the York Lions men’s football team, according to Joanne Rider of York media.
“We are extremely disturbed about this very serious allegation and are working closely with [Toronto Police Services] in support of their investigation,” says Rider, adding that the university has suspended its relationship with Younis until the police investigation is over.
Younis, who came to the Lions from the University of Toronto Varsity Blues’ coaching staff in 2011, had been volunteering at York for two years, during which time his duties included recruitment, scouting players, and coaching.
Younis has been relieved of his duties at the university pending the outcome of the investigation, says Rider.
