Eyes shut and shadows revealed
Fragile glass or so a heart it seems 
Plush greens and morning dreams 
Creative by law your aura it speaks 
Fell on a cascade of torturous light
Your pupils they reek of something so bright 
Let’s share the stage of misery and grief 
For my words too heavy and yours are a relief.
