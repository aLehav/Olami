When I started my term as editor-in-chief last May, I was pretty naive.
The vision I pitched in my job interview was one of Excalibur as a driving force for change on campus.
This has proven to be difficult though. The truth is, it’s hard to put out an exciting paper when on the surface, our campus can seem so dead.
Excalibur’s archives paint a picture of York that is unfamiliar to me—a York where students had some serious fight in them.
When they didn’t like something, instead of sitting around and complaining, they stood up and protested.
Whether they were opposed to a speaker coming to campus, an atrocity happening abroad, or a tuition fee hike, they gathered and made their views known.
One reason I came to York in the first place was its political culture. I had seen a 2009 video of a massive protest happening in Vari Hall, where passionate demonstrators on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict engaged in an important, heated debate. The tension was palpable.
While I’m not trying to romanticize aggression and I know protests can breed antagonism, I wanted to be in an environment where people were thinking progressively and wanted to make a difference.
But it seems like this culture of activism has left York. I don’t know what changed, but it’s certainly not that people now have nothing to protest about.
Some believe it was the installation of the kiosk in the middle of Vari Hall, others say it is the increasing corporatization of the university as a whole, and others still believe there are policies at York which seriously undermine students’ rights to assemble.
Have students stopped caring? Or have they been intimidated into silence?
There are issues I hear about in everyday conversation, from the rights of marginalized groups to how the university spends its money, that I know students care about deeply.
I’ve seen some efforts to bring these issues to light, but mainly in the form of petitions and online debates.
There are also those individuals who are fighting quietly but diligently, like Tamika Johnson, whose work on Boss Magazine we featured in our last issue.
When it comes to gathering on campus, however, we have been failing. Last year, a student-organized safety rally, which was supposed to have 1,000 attendees ended up attracting less than 100 people. No one wanted to stand outside in the cold.
Students Against Israeli Apartheid, whose club status was revoked last spring for holding an unauthorized rally in Vari Hall that “disrupted classes,” has a point. Vari Hall is the heart of this campus, and students need their gathering place back.
But more importantly, students need to realize the value of organized protest again.
If you look to our centrespread this week, we’ve tried to show the evolution and importance of activism at York. You’ll get a glimpse of what York used to be, which I hope inspires you.
This year, I wanted to highlight the efforts of those who were fighting for a cause. I just wish I’d had more to talk about.

As a Founders grad, Student Council, & Excalibur active participant from the early 70’s, I’ve recently been disappointed with your online feedback procedures and the lack of commitment to fix such a simple technological problem. Maybe this has now been addressed and If this comment is accepted I’ll be encouraged to contribute more.

Historically York has been known as the school where activism never stops.
So why have we seen such little of it recently? Protests seem to have all but disappeared from our campus, and this isn’t necessarily a good thing.
Has the school really managed to quiet its students?
According to OPIRG-York, an organization that conducts research, advocacy, and lobbying, as well as educational and media campaigns for social justice, “the decline of student activism has a direct correlation with the corporatization of York.”
With increased costs and budget cuts, York has basically become a big business, they say.
“York University was once an open institution that was used as a safe space to express different views, but unfortunately, the university’s administration has made clear their views on protests and the consequences the students will face if participating in such activities.”
We’ve decided to take a look back into the Excalibur archives at large student protests that refl ect York University’s once active and radical student political engagement.
We also highlight a few recent events that suggest while activism may be dormant on our campus, it isn’t dead.

A total of 1,596 York staff and faculty members have made it onto the 2013 Ontario Sunshine List.
The list discloses the salaries of people who earn over $100,000, working for public institutions in
Ontario. Included on York’s list are professors, librarians, program directors, deans, sports coaches, and senior staff .
Topping the list is York President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri who earns $478,405.94 as his yearly salary, and another $8,455.72 in taxable benefits.
Shoukri is the second-highest paid public sector employee within the university portion of the Sunshine List, coming in just behind Western University’s President and Vice-Chancellor Amit Chakma, who earns $479,600.04 and $41,467.28 in taxable benefits.
Brenda Spotton Visano, a professor of economics at York, sees a tension between the public’s right to know and the right to privacy for public sector employees.
“Should we reveal everybody’s income? I don’t think so,” says Visano.
She favours the idea of transparency, but would also like to see the salaries of employees of private corporations.
The Sunshine List has been published since the Ontario government passed the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act in 1996. Its purpose is to encourage a more open system of government.
Visano adds that the list should be adjusted, as the $100,000 cut- off was implemented in 1996, and suggests it should be moved closer to $150,000.
The list itself allows the public to compare individuals and their respective compensations, providing more information on how tax dollars are being spent.
The Sunshine List also includes employees of the Ontario government, crown agencies, municipalities, hospitals, boards of public health, school boards, colleges, Hydro One, Ontario Power Generation, and other public sector employers.

York President and Vice Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri recently met with Toronto Police Services to discuss improving security on campus after the March 6 Student Centre shooting.
The meeting, which took place on March 18, was closed to the public. A full debrief of the incident was conducted, and recommendations were proposed.
Shoukri and police agreed that for the remainder of the academic term, York would provide enhanced security patrols in “key public areas in and around the central core of Keele campus” during evening and night hours.
“Given the nature of the recent occurrence in the Student Centre, the enhanced patrols will focus on prime public locations on campus,” says Rob Castle, senior executive officer for the vp finance and administration.
“Of course, locations of the patrols can be adjusted if there is a need to do so, as the enhanced patrols will occur during evening and night hours.”
Patrols will be done by both Toronto Police and York Security officers. Only the Keele campus will see an increase in security presence.
Shoukri and Toronto Police also resolved to strengthen their ongoing relationship and the neighbourhood community response team.
Additionally, “An expanded campaign will encourage students, staff, and faculty to download the [YorkU Mobile Safety App], which will be a key element in emergency communications,” says Joanne Rider of York media.
With over 11,000 downloads by users for the app, a new push notification function has been added, allowing the university to have direct communication in urgent situations with York community members.
Castle says a “Campus Alert” feature has been added, which allows the university to communicate on-going programs and information to users.
“The voice over function was improved to ensure more accurate voice responses when a user presses specific icons,” he adds.
Two students were injured in the March 6 incident, which sparked this review of security measures on campus, and police arrested a suspect several days later.

After hearing arguments from both the defense and the Crown, jury members in the trial of Brian Dickson, the man accused of killing York student Qian Liu in 2011, will begin deliberations on April 7.
The Crown is charging Dickson with first-degree murder for the death of Liu, and has rejected Dickson’s plea for a manslaughter charge.
Liu was attacked by a man in her apartment in the Village while she was chatting online with her boyfriend, Xia Chao Meng, who was in Beijing at the time. She was found naked and face down in her room the next day after Meng managed to get word out to her friends and landlord that she could be in danger. 
On April 1, the court heard that DNA found on Liu’s abdomen, groin, fingernails, and chest matched Dickson’s DNA profile.
Forensic biologist Melissa Kell also testified that Liu could also not be excluded as a source of the DNA found on the bloodstained shirt collected from Dickson’s residence.
Forensic pathologist Dr. Christopher Milroy said Liu’s death may have been caused by mechanical asphyxiation, which is blockage of airways through neck or chest compression, as indicated by bruising on her neck and bleeding in her eyes.
Her roommate, Zahid Abdullah, who also testified on April 1, may have helped identify the shirt with the matching DNA sample. 
He told the jury he saw an unknown Caucasian male in the house the night of Liu’s death, wearing a shirt that matched the description of the one investigators eventually retrieved and tested.
Abdullah, however, did not directly identify Dickson.
Dickson’s lawyer, Robert Nuttall, is seeking a manslaughter ruling, arguing the cause of death needs to be definitive before one can determine intent beyond reasonable doubt.
Nutall also argued that Dickson’s mental capacity was reduced, based on his claim that he was medicated and intoxicated, but no evidence to prove this combination affected him has been presented as of publication.

The York University Student Centre’s board of directors has decided to increase security surveillance and lighting in the building.
Cameras will be installed facing the exits of the building, and lighting in the walkway and exterior of the building will be increased.
Jessica Thyriar, York Federation of Students president and spokesperson for the board of directors, says after discussions with stakeholders and groups in the Student Centre, a compromise was made to increase surveillance for safety reasons, but also ensure student privacy.
“We needed to find a balance between ensuring that folks who use the space for various reasons, such as support services, felt comfortable [and that their information remained confidential] and ensuring other students did feel safe when using the building,” says Thyriar.
Imran Mohamed, third-year kinesiology and psychology major, says the change is a positive one.
“It’s not exactly monitoring student activities inside the Student Centre. We still have our sense of privacy, [but] we know who is coming in and who is leaving,” says Mohamed.
Mohamed adds that while he supports the decision to add cameras facing the exits, he would not feel comfortable with cameras being installed in the food court or by the couches upstairs.
“If there is a sense of people watching you, you just do not feel right. It doesn’t add to the festivities or the atmosphere [that the Student Centre is trying to promote],” says Mohamed.
Thyriar says the board of directors is constantly reviewing ways to improve the Student Centre and ensure students feel safe.
“I think it’s important for the community to come together in various ways to share various things that we can do in regards to safety, and if we continue having these discussions and [making] efforts to actually put these things forward, it’s more of a community,” says Thyriar.
Currently, York has over 660 CCTV cameras overlooking parking lots, buildings, and classrooms, but there are none in the Student Centre.
