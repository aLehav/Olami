Fashion’s job is, simply put, to tell you how you want to dress before you know it, but that is definitely not limiting. With something this season for everyone’s personal style, I’m here to give you the insider’s scoop in summer fashion so that you what to expect, stay ahead of the game and look good while doing it, too.
For boys who enjoy dressing a little more conservatively, the trend this summer was something functional to keep you cool, while looking fashionable with a touch of nostalgia. This look is very easy to achieve with light cotton and linen shirts.
Many spring collections include short-sleeved button-down shirts with bright, fun, cheesy, and lovably nostalgic patterns and prints. Pair one of these breathable cotton shirts with a light t-shirt underneath and you have a versatile look for endless outdoor occasions. Linen is also the go-to look this summer for men as it is famous for being extremely light and breathable. A long-sleeve linen shirt is a great addition to any wardrobe as linen is generally sold in neutral colours that are effortless to pair with other items.
In terms of bottoms, the signature look of summer 2014 is denim shorts above the knee, cuffed or rolled up at the bottom. If you aren’t afraid to step a little bit out of your comfort zone, patterns and specifically floral patterns are this year’s hit for men.
Florals go great on pants, shirts, jackets, and everything in between. They give your outfit a non-traditional look that will surely separate you from the rest. With such a bold pattern, try to focus it more on one item at a time. If you wear a floral shirt, avoid wearing other patterns: you want the focus to be on that pattern without over-doing it. There are so many ways to wear a shirt, and they all have a different effect on your appearance.
Crew necks and V-necks are fun and classic looks, but it’s definitely time to try something new, boys. Rolled up sleeves are a great way to emphasize your arms. The sleeve ends a tad higher than regular t-shirts, giving you an opportunity to show off some definition. A longer length t-shirt that ends a few inches lower is a unique way to emphasize your height if you are on the taller side.
Finally, if you’re in the gym often enough to have achieved a chiseled chest, a grunge scoop t-shirt is an awesome way to show off your hard work. It’s essentially a regular crew neck t-shirt, but the neck is wider and deeper, showing off your trapezius and pectoral muscles.
Some new trends that are (believe it or not) making a comeback are crop tops and short shorts. Sometimes boys want to show off a bit more skin and if you’re confident in yourself, you could definitely try this look out for a summer outing to a beach or pool party, barbeque, or a day in the great outdoors. Crop tops were popular in men’s fashion in the 90s, as you can see in many high school shows. The classic snapshot is the high school quarterback having a serious conversation on his pastel yellow landline phone with his big haired crush. All the while sporting a jersey cropped to the navel, showing off his core and especially giving the audience a peek at his V-lines.
Ladies, summer is a great time to experiment with new fashions. Don’t be afraid to try something different! Many companies are focusing on bringing tropical culture to chilly, old Canada this summer, and that includes brining back maxi dresses. They are a perfect addition to every closet. They are flattering to every body type, and are impeccably easy to dress up or down for any occasion.
Most maxi dresses come in simple cotton-blend materials such as jersey, and this makes them fantastically comfortable and very easy to care for. For an effortless yet elegant look, pair a neutrally coloured maxi dress with a thin belt at the waist and matching wedges to achieve the perfect look for that beach or garden party you’ve been planning. Take that same dress and throw on a denim jacket and flashy accessories and you’re ready for those summer nights that top off the perfect summer days we are all longing for.
If you’re not into one-pieces, take a maxi skirt pulled up past the navel paired with a crop top for a sexier look that shows off just enough skin while keeping you cool. A lot of focus is brought to tropical prints and draping fabrics this year, and these prints are a great way to try something new. Try a light cardigan with a tropical print over a basic t-shirt and denim shorts for that Miami Beach look. Keep an eye out for fringes. Simply put, a fringe is a line of fabric with dangly strings all lined up, like the fringe of your hair.
Sheer shawls, purses, cardigans, necklaces, and even hoop earrings all seem to present opportunities for designers to add a fringe, and this is nothing but perfect. A fringe is a genius way for a designer to add movement to a piece. Any shift in position, every step will make this fringe naturally move on the garment and this looks simply amazing.
That being said, it seems like one of this summer’s trends for ladies is movement. Focus on wearing items that move on you, such as the famous fringe, light and sheer draping fabrics that will be picked up by the find and flutter in the breeze, patterns with lines and shapes that mesmerize an onlooker with every step you take like an optical illusion.

The Ontario government failed to allocate any additional graduate student spaces to York over the next three years in its recent strategic mandate signing spree with colleges and universities.
The government had been signing agreements with Ontario’s 45 post-secondary institutions, requesting that they provide lists of 10 programs they consider their strongest and five programs they wish to expand.
The decision to sign the agreements, otherwise known as “strategic mandate agreements” was allegedly made to end the duplication of programs and to move towards a more specialized system.
Regarding additional graduate student spaces, the University of Toronto will receive 580 new spots, Ryerson will receive 256, and York will receive none for the periods of 2014-2015 to 2016-2017.
In an article in the Toronto Star, York president and vice-chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri said he believed York was penalized in regard to graduate funding allocation because most of its current graduate students are not Canadian or permanent Canadian residents.
“On the one hand, the government tells us to take in more international students, then they don’t count them because they don’t fund them,” said Shoukri.
Rhonda Lenton, vice-president academic and provost says it is important to note York has one of the largest graduate student
populations in Ontario. “We continue to advocate for recognition and funding for international students, along with our colleagues in the sector.”
May Nazar of the communications branch at the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities says York was not given additional graduate spaces over the three-year period because eligible graduate enrolment has been under York’s targets in recent years.
According to the SMA between York and the MTCU, York was 341.18 under its target for the 2013-2014 period.
“York University still has room for eligible graduate enrolment growth, as its current enrolment remains below the target confirmed as part of the process,” says Nazar.
In its SMA, York identified engineering and science, bilingual programs, arts, digital media, performance and design, business/management/administration, and healthy individuals and communities as its proposed programs for future growth.
The SMA also notes a medical school on the horizon for York by 2020 in its vision statement.
Nazar, however, says at this time the ministries of Health and Long-Term Care and Training, Colleges, and Universities are not predicting medical education expansion over the short and medium term.
“We remain open to the future possibility of establishing a medical school,” says Lenton.
Lenton says in addition to focussing on York’s five designated programs, York will continue to set the foundation for a medical school.

Well, what do you expect?  With all the negative publicity recently about York U. I am surprised that they didn’t reduce funding for the University!   Crime Wave, Shootings, Sexual Assaults on Campus, Anti-Semitic incidents, SAIA hate-fest,  you think no one on Parliament Hill reads the papers – including THIS ONE?
Let me explain further, the Ontario government is, in effect, saying: “Read My Lips” to the University Administration.
They may not be up front about it, but they are communicating their displeasure about what is going on here… and in a very effective, attention getting manner, right in YorkU students pocketbook.

Toronto police are investigating the Immigration Watch Canada posters which appeared on York’s campus and the Village in August.
The posters in question display the York logo and target immigrants at York.
“If mass third world migration continues, White Canadians will be reduced to a persecuted minority,” the posters read.
Joanne Rider of York media says the posters were removed because there was no permission granted to post them. Official notification was sent to Immigrant Watch Canada instructing the organization to cease and desist using York’s logo and photographs.
“Diversity and inclusiveness are core values of York University,” says Rider.
According to Jenniferjit Sidhu, a media relations officer for Toronto Police Service, they received a radio call regarding the posters on Friday, August 1. York Security also provided a copy of the poster to the police.
According to Sidhu, the TPS Hate Crime Unit is reviewing the posters to confirm whether they constitute as potential hate propaganda. She also notes similarities to the posters which appeared in Brampton on April 22. However, it was determined after consultation that while the posters may be considered to be racist and offensive, they do not meet the threshold of the hate crime criteria in the Criminal Code of Canada.
“Why would we not distribute them at York?” says Dan Murray of Immigration Watch Canada. Does York deserve some immunity from exposure to free speech? Does the material in the flyers conflict with York ideology?”
Various campus groups and students have spoken out regarding the offensive posters.
“No one should be subjected to such hateful and offensive messaging on their campus or in their community,” said Mithilen Mathipalan, vice-president equity of the York Federation of Students in a press release.
 “Students deserve to live, work and study without fear of discrimination or harassment.”
“There is absolutely no place for this at York University,” said Mathipalan.
“We commend the administration for acting so quickly in removing these posters,” said Tamara Caplan, director of Hillel @ York.
“Hillel embraces multiculturalism and diversity on campus, and we encourage all students to speak out with us vigorously against acts of bigotry.”
Sidhu of TPS says each appearance of the flyers is investigated separately.
“We encourage anyone receiving these or any similar flyers to continue to report them to the police,” says Sidhu.
No criminal charges have been laid at this time.

The launch of the Toronto-York Spadina subway extension could be further delayed due to a lawsuit filed by the TTC against the contractor of Vaughan’s subway station.
The $10-million lawsuit argues that the contractor, Arup Canada failed to meet scheduled dead-lines, use “skilled, competent staff,” and to meet building and electrical codes.
It’s currently unknown if this alleged breach-of-contract will affect the current date of completion, and which subway sites will be impacted.
Although Andy Byford, TTC CEO, would not comment on the lawsuit to various media outlets, he said the plan to open the line remains set for late fall 2016.
“We do know that is going to be a challenge at a number of the sites. My project team is working with the contractors to see what’s possible,” said Byford in a CBC article.
According to Brad Ross, executive director of corporate communications for the TTC, lawsuits like this one against Arup Canada are common.
 “We have many contracts that we take action against to protect our interests, so this is not an unusual thing,” he says.
In an article to The National Post, Byford also revealed that the timeframe of the expansion has been difficult since the beginning.
The line extension has already been delayed once, as the completion was originally set for December 2015.
The TTC blamed this delay on contractor performance and the amount of time spent on obtaining funding approvals. The blame has also been placed on the time it took for the contractor to reach an agreement on station designs, extensive work needed to relocate utilities, and the death of a construction worker at the York construction site in October 2011.
For the time being, it is unknown if the project will be delayed further due to the lawsuit. The TTC maintains it is working to avoid this.
“I have no information to suggest that the project will be delayed because of this,” says Ross.
Andrew McAlpine, principal of Arup Canada, says the lawsuit is general in nature and was filed over six months ago.
“While we are responding in due course, we remain confident of an amicable resolution and continue to keep our focus on delivering a successful project.”

York student Annie Truong-Le’s passing at this summer’s Veld Music Festival shocked Toronto and surrounding communities.
Truong-Le, 20, was studying to complete her BA in political science.
She died suddenly after allegedly ingesting unknown party drugs at the two-day music event held on August 2 at Downsview Park.
The student’s family has been understandably heartbroken by the event, with Truong-Le’s
friends and family lashing out at media outlets via Twitter as a result of the news coverage.
Truong-Le interned for City Councillor Anthony Perruzza, helping constituents with their municipal issues. She also helped organize special events,community meetings and assisted with and organized community advocacy.
“Annie was a smart, charismatic young woman full of life, full of purpose with a great future,” says Perruzza.
“Her sudden passing is a terrible loss for all of us. I will miss her.”
According to Perruzza, she spent a great deal of volunteer time assisting others and asking for nothing in return. She had a bubbly, infectious personality and was the kind of person many could not help but like.
Truong-Le was also very active with a local community agency called MATA (Mentoring Arts Tutoring Athletics), which helps youth by providing guidance and mentorship. The program aims to promote post-secondary education and betterment of youth in marginalized communities.
Regarding the consumption of drugs and alcohol, the university has a number of initiatives to prevent irresponsible consumption at this year’s frosh, regardless of the incident.
The National College Health Assessment statistics regarding campus alcohol consumption breaks through the illusion of York students heavily consume alcohol.
Based on the study sample, people thought only 4.7 per cent of York students abstain from alcohol. But according to the study, 28 per cent of York students refrain from the use of alcohol completely.
Health Education at York also supports the delivery of Alcohol EDU, an alcohol teaching program to all first year students living in residence, as well as varsity athletes, orientation leaders, and other peer leaders from across the university.
According to Leah State, coordinator at Health Education, York is currently in the process of rolling out a bystander intervention program.
New students are urged to use the multitude of York safety initiatives, including the safety app which, to date, has been downloaded almost 13,000 times.

After much deliberation, York in cooperation with Seneca College, has chosen Markham as the preferred location for the potential new York campus.
Markham, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, East Gwillimbury, and Aurora in collaboration with Newmarket originally delivered proposals to York and Seneca.
The new campus was shortlisted for Vaughan, Markham, and Richmond Hill in April.
York announced on June 23 it would be working in collaboration with Seneca College to submit a proposal to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities to build a new campus in Markham Centre.
“The Markham Centre site is located in the heart of a vibrant new urban centre, close to Ontario’s ‘Big Move’ transit investments and other amenities for students,” says Rhonda Lenton, vice-president academic and provost.
According to Lenton, the size and design of the proposed campus have yet to be determined.
Within five years of opening, the university aims for the campus to hold 5,000 students.
Over the next 20 years, the campus is expected to hold between 10,000 to 20,000 students.
A report to the Board of Governors meeting on June 23 states the new campus is estimated to need 2.4 million square feet at capacity and is predicted to be a $300 to $400-million project.
Lenton says York’s collaboration with Seneca for the project will take York’s strength in student mobility and flexibility to a new level that will benefit new and current students.
“We are thrilled with the opportunity in Markham Centre and it is just the beginning of our plan to be in more locations across the region over time,” said York president and vice-chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri in a YFile article.
Lenton notes the new campus will allow the university to better serve the York Region, which she says is one of Ontario’s fastest growing major urban areas.
Dave Barrow, mayor of Richmond Hill, said in a press release that although he is disappointed the campus will not be in Richmond Hill, he is excited about the possibility of having a campus so close to the town.
“We look forward to working with our neighbours to the east and with the entire York Region community in supporting York University’s bid for a campus in our region.”
Tim Simmonds, executive director for the city of Vaughan says the new campus will create jobs and become a catalyst to future development across the region.
“From an education, economic, and social perspective, this campus is a positive for the entire community,” says Simmonds.
The city of Markham was unavailable to comment on the proposal.
Lenton says the university is working closely with Seneca, the city of Markham, and York Region to submit an “outstanding” proposal that addresses the criteria outlined by the MTCU by the deadline date, September 26.
A decision is expected to be announced in early 2015.

A proposal has been put forward to add a new wing to the Schulich School of Business, according to a memo included in the Board of Governor’s agenda package this past summer.
The proposal was for BOG to approve-in-principle, a new project on condition of the successful fundraising of 75 per cent of the anticipated $40-million project.
The expansion will be designed to accommodate the growing number of MBA and PhD students, many of whom arrive from international destinations and have different social, cultural, and intellectual needs.
According to the BOG memo, “Internal growth pressures are severely taxing the current building and external pressures are derived from several sources, including increased competition from top international business schools at the graduate level.”
Since the Seymour Schulich Building opened in 2003, the undergraduate population has grown by 25 per cent beyond what was originally planned.
Upwards of 60 per cent of MBA students now come from outside of Canada. As stated by the memo, The Schulich School of Business, India, when opened will further accelerate this trend.
“I’ve never felt that’s been an issue,” says Jessica Gill, a third year international bachelor of business administration student.
“I think Schulich has done a pretty good job of accommodating all students. I do believe there has been an increase in incoming students, so perhaps it’s getting difficult for them to manage it.”
York administration provided a signal that they will endorse the proposed expansion with the approval-in-principle, and according to the memo, they will fully collaborate with the project.
It’s expected that enabling the site plan approval in parallel with the fundraising exercise will shorten the project’s path by an estimated eight months.
The Schulich student body remains largely unaware of the proposed building expansion.
“I’m not sure exactly what resources the expansion will bring, but I’m sure it will definitely enhance the MBA program,” says Gill
According to York advisor and deputy spokesperson Janice Walls, “It’s very preliminary at this point so there’s no more information available beyond what is in the Board of Governors’ package.”

Head Start at York helped new students understand how to communicate their academic needs and accommodations to professors during the annual event hosted by Mental Health Disabi-lity Services.
The summer transition program aimed to help students learn from peers, faculty, and industry experts on how to navigate York’s resources, and how to interact with professors when requesting academic accommodations.
Dr. Jennifer Lund of Trent University spoke at Head Start earlier in the week.
“Accommodation for students with mental health disabilities looks a bit different at each university and college,” says Dr. Lund. “However, there is consistency in that the mandate of our offices is to provide access so students can be successful in their studies.”
Dr. Lund openly talks about living with bipolar disorder and specifies that, most importantly, for those who live with mental health disabilities, is the option, with supporting medical documentation, to be registered as equivalent to full-time when they choose to take a reduced course load to prioritize health and maximize academic strengths.
Students registered with disability services are required to hand in their accommodation forms to professors early in the semester. Although, students may often find the process difficult if professors are not understanding.
This event helped students utilize specific resources related to mental health, and how they can interact with professors to communicate their needs.
“If you are nice to people, you are more likely to get what you want, and this is true to any aspect of life,” says Associate Professor Jennifer Kuk from the School of Kinesiology and Health Science.
Kuk presented students with information on how to become more familiar with the accommodation process and how they can discuss their needs with their future professors.
“Teaching is only one-third of your professor’s responsibility,” she adds.
“Professors do care, but sometimes they may not know how to accommodate or have the time to accommodate in the way you want. Let us know what you need early so we can better accommodate in a fair way to you, the other students, and the professor.”
Kuk’s opening comments at Head Start specified how she was hired for her research background and had not been traditionally trained as a teacher. At this point, she was not familiar with York’s accommodation process.
Like many professors, Dr. Kuk learned about disability services and accommodations for students as she taught. She often required students to explain what their specific needs were.
MHDS offers the three-day program ‘Head Start’ every August to students who identify with having a mental health challenge.
“Accommodation is always confidential – this is also key,” says  Dr. Lund.
“Meeting with a disability/accessibility counsellor is key to feeling heard, understood and validated.”
“I can’t tell you how important my counsellor at MHDS at York was to me during my doctoral degree. I can state unequivocally that her confidence and faith in me was instrumental in my completing my degree.”
“My challenges as a student was feeling confident that I would be seen as competent while registered with a disability,” says Dr. Lund.
“I learned to address the shame that I felt and learned to ask for what would make me successful academically. I learned skills in self advocacy through MHDS which have served me in all areas of my life, particularly in requesting accommodation as a university employee.”
Students often struggle to navigate the accommodation system, including the alternative exam centre, which has specific criteria for registration. The alternative exam centre has allegedly changed their registration requirements since the winter academic season.
“The Head Start program was a good way to get a jump on the upcoming school year and feel better prepared,” says one student who chose to remain anonymous.
“It was really helpful to learn more about all of the services CDS, MHDS and LSS provides and how to easily access them. The guest speakers and peer mentors were very relatable and informative. Also, it was a great opportunity to make connections with other students.”

You’ve arrived at York and so we tip our metaphorical hats to you. By now you are more than likely lost and afraid, and you may or may not have dropped close to $400 on textbooks for one class. It sucks, we know.
But for now welcome to our frosh issue where we’ve done our very best to supply you with tips and tricks that will help make your transition into York life as easy as possible.
It’s not easy being a student; you are probably in some sort of debt and will most likely walk into the wrong lecture hall several times. As you step into the wrong crowded lecture hall, I will chuckle to myself and smile as your gaze of confusion glistens, and close to 300 students stop taking notes just to look at you.
I will be honest with you, university isn’t easy. Unless you’re a genius, you will need to put legitimate effort into your studies. That means going to class, taking notes, and actually speaking up in your tutorials. Those participation marks can really kill your GPA. Take a look at your syllabus, you might lose close to 10 per cent of your mark if you pull off the silent treatment gig. Tutorials can be legitimately scary, and it might make you pee a little, but every other new student is in the same position as you.
You can do it, we have confidence in you. If you are actually lost and confused, there are many places
to turn to for advice. I’d suggest getting involved with one of the many student associations and clubs across campus. There you will meet students who have a
bit more experience than you, and can often answer those stupid questions you are dreading to ask. There are endless intramural programs to join, and your respective college has it’s own student government who would love for you to get involved.
Excalibur is the same, we want you to stroll in and get involved with the paper. As an institution, we are constantly in need of volunteers. No experience required, just a good attitude and a smile here
or there helps quite a bit.
Not to mention the school itself has many programs and counselling services to help you enjoy some
of the best years of your life.
Whatever your interests are, from Nintendo to self-defense, Pokemon to Harry Potter, there really is something for everyone here at York. It’s a great way to make some new friends and feel all the more comfortable during your time here. No, you won’t need to study everyday, and yes, you will have free time. So make the most of it, deal? Deal.
Have some fun this frosh and be yourself. Your parents aren’t watching and it’s time to not only get your degree, but also go through some personal growth and become the person you want to be.
Please, don’t be afraid.

As the forthcoming school year looms, Excalibur recommends a break from reality and an escape into the realm of cinematic ingenuity with this year’s Toronto International Film Festival.
Canadian films are better than ever, with Quebec native Xavier Dolan leading the charge at the tender age of 25.
 Al Pacino will be featured in a one-on-one conversation at the Festival Kickoff Party. Comedic treasure Bill Murray, in a year being dubbed “the year of Bill Murray” will also be celebrated on September 5’s “Bill Murray Day.”
 So ditch the books and take a look at our five pre-TIFF choices, before the late nights and caffeine-induced mania kick in.

Foxcatcher
Directed by: Bennett Miller
Stars: Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Steve Carell
 The film revolves around the true life drama of wrestling champions Mark and Dave Schultz. The brothers find themselves in an unfortunate situation following promises made by millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) to bring them fame, wealth, and glory.
 Dubbed “Team Foxcatcher,” the brothers get caught up in the dysfunctional lifestyle of rich, gun-crazed, and eccentric du Pont, who suffers from severe paranoia. The three characters end up colliding at the peak of their Olympics venture in Seoul.
 Early reviewers are citing great performances by the trio, with Oscar buzz surrounding the film’s acting, directing, and writing.

The Imitation Game 
Directed by: Morten Tyldum
Stars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley
 Norwegian director Morten Tyldum makes his English debut with the biopic The Imitation Game.
 Critics are raving about Benedict Cumberbatch and his Oscar-worthy performance as the genius mathematician, cryptanalyst, and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing.
He was the one who spearheaded the technical charge to decode German naval communications during World War II.
 Turing’s efforts not only helped shorten the war, but also inspired technological advancement to the point that computers could first
be imagined.
Aside from the war, Turing also faces difficulties with his homo-sexuality, during a time of impossible acceptance by society. He finds support through his colleague and friend Joan Clarke played by
Keira Knightley.

Two Days, One Night 
Directed by: Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne
Stars: Marion Cotillard
 Starring French beauty Marion Cotillard, the French-language Two Days, One Night revolves around the tale of Sandra, a young Belgian mother who finds out her colleagues have opted to receive annual bonuses in exchange for her dismissal.
 In trying to institute a vote against the decision, Sandra has only a weekend to convince her co-workers to save her from being dismissed.
This heart-wrenching drama brings out the best and worst in working lives and friendships, with Cotillard leading in what many believe to be her best performance yet.
 The Belgian directors have won two Palme d’Ors and a Grand Prix in Cannes.

Winter Sleep
Directed by: Nuri Bilge Ceylan
 Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan is famous for his films Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011) and Distant (2002), winning the Grand Prix, Best Director, Grand Jury, and Palm d’Or at Cannes.
Winter Sleep is set in central Anatolia in Turkey, and follows a hotel during its offseason in a half-empty small village, along with the life of its owner and local celebrity actor Aydin.
The director utilizes magnificent cinematography, meticulous dialogue, and striking landscapes.
 Winter Sleep has already won the Palme d’Or this year, and been chosen as Turkey’s submission for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars.
The emotional and psychological spectrum of Ceylan’s
films require patience and an active audience.

Mommy
Directed by: Xavier Dolan
 At the age of 25, Montreal-based filmmaker Xavier Dolan earned himself the Jury Prize with the
film Mommy in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.
This kid has every right to be crowned the king of hearts in Canadian filmmaking and this year’s TIFF is sure to hold him in the highest regards.
Mommy encircles the rocky relationship between a single mother and her troubled teenage son.
 The emotional drama includes spontaneous sex, intense depth, and some serious Oedipal comedy.

Winter Sleep is set in central Anatolia in Turkey, and follows a hotel during its offseason in a half-empty small village, along with the life of its owner and local celebrity actor Aydin.
The director utilizes magnificent cinematography, meticulous dialogue, and striking landscapes.
 Winter Sleep has already won the Palme d’Or this year, and been chosen as Turkey’s submission for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars.
