A: I think with experimental film you have this idea in your mind, but it’s hard to convey that to a wider audience. After coming up with the images, it was really the sound and editing that pulled the idea together. I wanted to explore the details of child marriages through imagery and metaphors, instead of directly stating the obvious.
A: Making this film was extremely important for me, especially about a topic that is alien to this part of the world. Being from Pakistan, I have encountered many child brides, all who had suffered through many hardships. So the purpose of this film was to shine light on something that goes on in different parts of the world, but isn’t a topic of discussion here in Canada.

A: I was the Director of Photography for Cupid as well as one of the Cinematographers for Woven Together. Nathan Street, the Director of Woven Together describes his film as “Sex takes many forms. Love takes many forms. A fragmented view of sex, intimacy, connection and love.” Maria DeSanctis, the Director of Cupid, describes her film as “The typical story of boy meets girl, except the boy is a magical figure sent from above.” My initial inspirations for the look of Cupid were the films The Hours and Dear White People. Because the film takes place both in “Heaven” and on Earth I gave the two locales distinct looks so that they were easily distinguishable. My segments of Woven Together were also really different, as were most of the segments done by the rest of the cinematographers on the film. The NFB film Pas De Deux by Norman McLaren inspired the black and white segment.
A: My favorite story was when we were shooting Cupid, our lead actor had to be in a diaper in freezing cold February weather. One time we were setting up the shot and we looked in the window outside and he was jumping and dancing in his diaper getting prepared for the scene.
A: I like working with moving images. I consider myself more of a technician than a filmmaker. I graduated in June, right now I’m shooting some smaller stuff and [Assistant Camera] on some non-union film and television productions in the city. The best thing I did at York was take Phil Hoffman’s Alternative Project class. Phil is the best professor I’ve ever had and an amazing filmmaker and member of the experimental film community. His class teaches you everything from production techniques, to experimental film theory, to processing and tinting film by hand.

A: My film OMNOM, is about the growing culture of consumerism in the middle to upper class. There are four upper class subjects and one homeless man who partake in an average meal.  The result leaves the homeless man non-existent.  There is a heavy alternative/experimental tone of the film that leaves the audience to reflect on their connection made to the film as well as ask questions of themselves in relation to the themes presented in the film.
A: the works of Norman McLaren and a filmmaker friend of mine, Rebecca Ortiz, inspired me.  Both filmmakers have influenced and inspire me to make films that engage the audience and inspire discussion.   My mission as a filmmaker is to make direct connections with audiences, ultimately soliciting a moment of reflection.  The spectator should feel a connection to the film for the film to be whole.
A: I think the evolution of the film from stage to stage was something really unique that I hadn’t experienced before on a project.  It taught me that art can transform at any time. That maybe not knowing what is trying to be communicated is not such a negative in art because at the end of it all, I think I created something that can be interpreted in so many different ways and can ultimately be relatable to anyone watching.
A: Film is a medium that can incorporate so many art forms in one.  It is literally a clash of moving pictures that our brains make sense of which I think is something to marvel at. The message in OMNOM needed to be told to possibly rid at least one person’s life of complacency and really appreciate the beauty in the world around us.  In our anxiety-ridden society, we need to stop focusing on what we don’t have and always wanting more and more and more.
I want to be a filmmaker in order to share my perspectives on this world on a wide scale. I want my ideas, my feelings, and my fears to be communicated with many people.  I’ve got a lot to say. I’ve got a lot of questions in my head, and filmmaking has always been an adequate way for me to express myself and seek answers, if any.
