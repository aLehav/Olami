York activists joined UNITE HERE Local 75 union members last week in celebrating “Hotel Workers Rising,” a decade-long campaign centred around securing rights for hospitality workers.
“With Toronto Rising, we are taking the next step. We’re partnering with community groups across the city to stand up for a living wage for all, good jobs in our communities, affordable housing across the GTA, a Toronto that works for young people and equal rights under the law for immigrant- and service-workers,” reads a media advisory released by Marc Hollin, coordinator for UNITE HERE Local 75.
Melissa Sobers, food service campus coordinator for Real Food Real Jobs campaign, states the main goal of the Toronto Rising summit was to be a kick-off event for the 2,000 low-wage food service workers who will potentially be entering into a strike across the city, including at universities like York.
“The strike would be a collective bargaining for living wages and benefits with the goal of ultimately breaking the cycle of precariousness, lack of dignity and stigma that food service jobs hold,” she says.
Sobers recounts the event’s historical origins, saying hotel workers across the city used to make poverty wages similar to what food service workers are paid today, approximately $12 per hour with no benefits.
“Due to their tireless acts of solidarity and demonstrations, hotel workers in downtown Toronto are currently making approximately $20 per hour with decreased workloads and full benefits, thus setting a standard for the vast majority of hotel workers in the city in terms of wages,” says Sobers.
Sobers states that food service workers are now trying to achieve the same standards of employment. Allies like Fight for $15 & Fairness in Canada and the United States, the Changing Workplaces Review in Ontario and the organizing efforts of the Black Lives Matter movement make this goal seem more achievable.
“The event also hosted discussions on how the labour laws in Ontario presently discriminate against contract service workers, such as the York Aramark food service workers, ultimately targeting racialized people since they are over-represented in this line of work,” explains Sobers.
For instance, Filipino workers alone compose 75 per cent of hotel workers in Toronto, according to The Philippine Reporter. 
“We understand that low-wage jobs for Filipino immigrants is a growing issue. We have many skilled and educated Filipinos struggling at the bottom of the job market,” said the Filipino Student Association at York, or FSAY, in a statement to Excalibur.
Many Filipinos get stuck in these positions because they are trapped balancing 40-hour work weeks and raising a family, all while getting used to their new environment, according to FSAY.
Meanwhile, the Ontario Public Interest Research Group at York, or OPIRG, intends to collaborate with other campaigns to address issues of unfair treatment of immigrants in the workforce, minimum wage, exorbitant tuition fees and unaffordable rent.
“OPIRG York attended in order to help connect student issues to the broader movement as well as to provide support to the food service workers at York who are currently fighting for more respect in the workplace and better conditions,” says Imran Kaderdina, admin and information coordinator for OPIRG York.
One of the highlights of the event was the Fairbnb coalition, which aims to hold Airbnb, a popular home-sharing platform, accountable for its short-term rentals.
“Airbnb was discussed in the context of its threat to affordable housing access in the city to people like us, the working poor, students in debt as well as the great living-wage jobs that hotel workers have fought so hard to establish,” says Sobers.
Sobers claims Airbnb is a threat because of its non-taxed, non-regulated nature. UNITE HERE Local 75 expresses similar sentiments: “As Airbnb ‘ghost hotels’ proliferate, workers in regulated hotels will see their hours cut. Our paycheques will shrink as our housing costs go up. While Airbnb alone didn’t cause Toronto’s housing affordability crisis, it certainly isn’t helping.”
Filipino Canadian Youth Alliance at York, Ethiopian and Eritrean Workers Network, Federation of Metro Tenants Association, CUPE 3903, U of T’s student union and members from the Osgoode Hall Law union were some of the community groups in attendance.

If you’re a sports fan, you’ve probably heard of players being sidelined with concussions. Perhaps you’re a fantasy sports enthusiast, and have had to adjust your lineup because one of your starters was knocked out with a concussion. Or maybe you just really like Will Smith and saw the 2015 film.
But what is a concussion?
Concussions, often referred to by athletes as the c-word, are traumatic brain injuries usually caused by hits to the head.
Other injuries are fairly easy to detect—if you break a bone, for example, there is usually a visible indication of the injury, as well as an incredible amount of pain. But concussions are an invisible injury, and are harder to detect.
Fortunately, advancements in technology and increased research have allowed us to learn more about the nature of concussions.
A recent study by Purdue University found that concussions are possibly caused by multiple hits to the head over time, as opposed to the previous notion that they were caused by a single impact. Another common misconception about concussions is that they go away after a certain amount of time, without any lingering side effects. In reality, many people who experience concussions also experience post-concussion syndrome, where symptoms last for more than six weeks.
But what are the symptoms, and how do you know if you have a concussion? According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms include headaches, loss of consciousness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, fatigue and slurred speech.
In severe concussions, a person’s pupils may appear different sizes, with one dilated more than the other.
Some symptoms may take longer to show up, such as memory loss and an inability to concentrate, irritability and personality shifts, sensitivity to light, erratic sleeping patterns and even psychological disorders such as depression, according to Mayo Clinic.
More alarming are the findings by the researchers at York’s Centre for Vision Research, who found that athletes who suffer concussions may also have neurological deficits that are typically not detected in standard clinical assessments.
The study compared the cognitive-motor integration between 51 athletes who had never been diagnosed with a concussion, and 51 athletes who had a history of concussions but were no longer showing symptoms.
The goal of the study was to determine whether athletes with a history of concussions displayed any impairment when asked to “think and move at the same time.” Participants were asked to perform two separate tasks that tested their cognitive-motor integration.
According to the results, athletes who had never suffered a concussion performed the tasks roughly 50 milliseconds faster than athletes who had.
While that doesn’t sound like a large difference, it could be the difference between getting hit or not, according to Professor Lauren E. Sergio.
These tests could also provide a more accurate assessment for determining when a player is safely able to return to the field or rink. If a player returns to their sport too soon after experiencing a concussion and suffers another, known as second impact syndrome, the results could be devastating and even fatal.
Side effects of second impact syndrome include swelling in the brain, possible herniation, loss of consciousness, acute metabolic changes and cerebral blood flow alterations, according to brainandspinalcord.org.
Hopefully as we learn more about the brain and how it functions, we can find ways to ensure player safety and better diagnose concussions—or prevent them from happening at all.

Let’s face it: staying focused in class is hard—especially in the age of technology, where laptops and cellphones are everywhere you look. Since 2000, when the mobile revolution began, the average attention span dropped from 12 to eight seconds. It is hard to focus when you’re distracted by chatter in the back of the class and a never-ending stream of late students. This difficulty increases with lecture lengths.
Although the average attention span has dropped quite a bit, fourth-year psychology student Shakil Mirza says it heavily depends on the lecture. “I have sat through three-hour psychology lectures once a week, and one-hour biology lectures three times a week. I’ve been alert and more attentive in the latter, because I’d be more interested [and] there is no time to doze off. Even with a middle break in a three-hour lecture, not everyone comes back to class,” says Mirza. One of the perks of hour-long lectures is that there’s no time to stop—so you’d better write notes and stay focused as if your life depended on it.
But what about the dreaded three-hour lectures? How do students possibly stay focused? Are they simply wasting their time? The answer is, surprisingly, that there are some benefits to long lectures. For one, commuting times can be reduced, saving time and money. Rather than travelling to campus several times a week, stacking up longer classes could cut down on days travelling to school, thus saving those pricey tokens. You know that a broke student is willing to do anything to save those valuable dollars.
“All of my courses are three-hour classes, and sometimes they are back-to-back. I actually prefer three-hours lectures over [hour-long] lectures as it cuts down on commute time. But I do often struggle with paying attention. I try to sit close enough to the [professor] that I can engage in discussion, but far enough so that I can slip out easily if I need a break, which is often,” says fourth-year global health policy, management and systems student Anmol Yagnik.
Three-hour lectures allow for more opportunities to spend time with the professor and fellow students to develop a strong connection with them. “I love long lectures as I feel the professors cover more of the material in detail. They are more prone to tell their personal stories regarding the text or theories presented, which I enjoy. It makes it easier to comprehend and more interesting,” says third-year psychology student Waverly Pegelo.
That being said, if you are planning to take or currently taking three-hour-long lectures, try to find a different course offering that can break them down into one-hour lectures. If you cram your schedule with class after class of three-hour lectures, be mindful of the hazards and honest with yourself: are you actually learning and retaining the material, or are you just wasting your time and money? It does depend on preference and on the specific person.
If it is nearly impossible to split your class schedule, here are some tips. Turn off all devices, such as your cellphone and laptop, if possible. This prevents the possibility of opening time-wasting applications. Sitting in the front of the class will keep you focused and be an incentive to not use your devices. Ask yourself if you really need to bring a laptop to take notes. Recent research by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer of Princeton University and the University of California found that writing notes by hand requires a different type of cognitive processing than when typing notes. Since writing by hand is a slower method, it also allows for more time to digest information. Try finding a professor with favourable ratings. One of the more popular sites used for rating professors is ratemyprofessors.com. If a professor is passionate about the subject and teaches the material in a clear and concise way, chances are you will be more attentive in class and learn more about the material. Until then, stay alert!

Tattoos are everywhere. Take a glance around and it will not take you long to locate someone with a tattoo. Maybe your friend tattooed his ex-girlfriend’s name on his arm, or maybe your grandpa has a tattoo hidden away from his rock n’ roll days. Maybe you have a tattoo yourself. If so, you might have found yourself exploring this unique art form in a museum exhibit. 
This year the Royal Ontario Museum, or ROM, hosted an exhibit dedicated to showcasing the diverse body art form of tattooing. Tattoos: Ritual. Identity. Obsession. Art, opened its doors on April 2, 2016 and closed on September 5, 2016. Visitors were invited to an exhibition that not only displayed the uniqueness and variety of tattoos, but also the traditional, historical and cultural context associated with this intrinsic art form.  
The exhibit enabled onlookers to have a multifaceted learning experience. Spanning over the course of 5,000 years, the exhibit provided a history of both ancient and modern tattoos, while also paying tribute and highlighting some of the world’s most famous and talented tattoo artists, such as Sailor Jerry, and their respected pieces. This was done using various visual aids, artifacts, posters and silicone figures that were used to reproduce tattoo pieces. 
Tools that were used to draw tattoos were scattered all over the museum. One of the more complex and inventive tools featured was a handmade tattoo gun crafted by prison inmates. Using the limited supplies available, the prisoners were able to use ball point pens, wire and spool to create electric and manual machines. 
The exhibit also provided a historic and cultural context for tattoos, exploring how tattoos are regarded in America, Asia and Europe. In a historical context, the museum displayed photographs of the chests of Auschwitz prisoners in Nazi camps and the identification tattoos the Nazis’ inked onto the inmates’ skin. Juxtaposed with these pictures were the bodies of the grandchildren of some of these survivors, who tattooed the identification numbers onto their skin as a way to remember and honour their family and family history. 
On a cultural level, the museum explored what tattoos meant to different cultures, such as the Japanese. This was explored through a documentary video that interviewed famous and rewound Japanese tattoo artist Horiyoshi III, who specializes in full body tattoos. Horiyoshi III said that tattoos are important to the Japanese culture he caters to because they view tattoos as a symbolic and personal expression. When a person goes out to the workplace, they are seen as that person; a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher. However, once they are in their naked form, their tattoos became their own personal, symbolic expression of their true inner identity. In a Japanese cultural context, tattoos are essential in cultivating modes of personal identity and expression. 
Every empty space, every wall and every corner of the tattoo exhibit was scattered with unique information on tattoos and the rich history that accompanies it. Whether you have your own obsession with tattoos, want to learn more about this ancient form of body art, or have a burning passion for history, the exhibit satisfied all these interests. What was most amazing about the exhibit was the way it took tattoos and gave them an identity not many would expect. In modern society, tattoos are met with mixed reactions, but a spectator who went to the exhibit would have left with a newly found perspective that hopefully allowed them to see that tattoos are more than just ink on skin; they are a tool for cultures to cultivate identities that penetrate external surfaces.

As an international student, I come from a country where student activism and politics are banned across university campuses and journalism has become a guise for promoting a corporate agenda.
Coming to York, colloquially referred to as a “social justice university,” I found a sense of freedom in expression and joined many social justice groups on campus in various leadership capacities.
I also ended up becoming the assistant news editor at Excalibur, York’s largest student newspaper. Given my involvement, many have branded me as playing a contradictory role of both an activist and a journalist.
I disagree with this characterization.
The terms “activism” and “media” mean different things to different people. The former could imply anything from justice and equality to radicalism and extremism while the latter could imply anything from truth and accountability to lies and propaganda.
Both terms can have widely contrasting connotations depending on factors involved and context of discussion, yet we can perhaps agree that a combination of the two generally provokes unease and cognitive dissonance among people.
While that may be true, it is just one perspective of looking at things. During my time at Excal, I have personally come to experience the converging influence of the two fields.
Journalists and activists are not enemies nor always at loggerheads with each other. Most of the time, our work is complementary and collaborative, not in the sense that journalists endorse any particular activist agenda, but rather that we consistently keep track of and report on any arising developments within activist groups. In short, we both need each other, regardless of our differences.
The idea of objectivity, in context of journalism, is very misplaced. Journalism, like activism, in many ways is agenda-driven. While we aim to offer unbiased, critical perspectives, one cannot deny that there are always dominant themes and angles, a by-product of stories with cracks left unexplored.
Student activism has the power to expose one to hot-button issues, ranging from anti-tuition fees campaigns, campus racism and sexual violence campaigns to international issues such as the Israel-Palestine controversy and other cases of nationalistic self-determination struggles.
While some may find certain campus politics disagreeable, it undeniably sparks a degree of critical thinking, which in itself is a sign of progress. Yet student politics is not immune to criticism, whether it be allegations of romanticizing and oversimplifying struggles or simply being written off as ineffective.
This is where we student journalists play a key role. Besides putting a spotlight on emerging issues, we indirectly give activist groups a greater impetus to act while maintaining a historic memory of community events through our extensive documentation.
Despite points of criticism, I think it is safe to say that both activism and journalism are inevitable outcomes of challenging the status quo in an unfair world, and they are here to stay. Both are united by common themes of community, shared networks and storytelling.
My point is to move beyond the concept of binary thinking, of pro- this and anti- that, labelling things as right and wrong and pigeonholing ideas into neatly packaged definitions. Instead, we should aspire to create a space where we can have honest and challenging discussions about our current paradigms, where we are constantly redefining our roles and open-heartedly embracing the conflict-ridden process of changing the world.
