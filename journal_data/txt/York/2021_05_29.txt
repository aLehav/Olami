Riddhi is a Biomedical Science student with an ever-growing enthusiasm for art. Still in search of her own art style, Riddhi takes inspiration from a variety of art forms and media to build her portfolio. She hopes to implement her creative energy into her art as well as her writing as she journeys to improve her outlook on real-world events. When she is not designing, writing, or studying, she can be found adding to her never-ending list of to-be-reads, working on her novel, trying out new skateboard tricks, and hiking through the nearest forest (looking for the entrance to a magical land, of course).
