Leslie Armstrong reports on Toronto Draws Tintin: artists from York and beyond reinvent Hergé’s classic hero
Marta Chudolinska’s conception of Hergé’s Tintin is not what you’d expect. Her drawing “Les Aventures de Tinatina” depicts the wiry reporter in a pleated skirt, rouged cheeks, and long, dark lashes.
Other imaginative conceptions in the Toronto Draws Tintin series can be found at the Steam Whistle Brewery, including an Edward Cullen-esque Tintin, a minimalist painting of a sailor’s anchor, and a videogame scene of Tintin and Snowy in flight.
Including work from Toronto-based artists Chester Brown, Michael DeForge, and Zach Worton, the collection of drawings and paintings reworks the characters, at times humourously, and at times somberly. Sponsored by The Beguiling, a comic shop in the Annex, the art show pays homage to Hergé’s extensive artistic legacy. Peter Birkemoe, owner of the cozy shop, is humble about the whole affair.
“It’s not an unusual set of circumstances to see that work reflected through contemporary artists a generation two or three later,” says Birkemoe. “It’s very common, particularly in the comics community, where people have drawn Batman. Many people have drawn something inspired by Akira or Mickey Mouse. It often happens in a charitable context like this.”
Birkemoe says that it is necessary to honour Hergé because his “influence is so great that it’s hard to find a cartoonist who isn’t influenced by his work.”
Also partaking in the art show is York’s first-year fine arts major Tess Reid. Her mixed media submission (which appears on the left-hand corner) depicts a scene in “Destination Moon” where Captain Haddock tells Professor Calculus that he is “acting the goat,” to which Professor Calculus becomes enraged. Her materials are cutout paper, and her colour scheme is fiery red to communicate anger. Her unusual choice of material was simple.
“A lot of people were doing screen printing and pen and ink, but I wanted to do something different,” says Reid. “As long as people recognize craftsmanship, it’s more of a standout.”
The York student prefers a craftsman’s approach to her work, claiming her favourite style of work is to make “personal cards,” geared to the individual’s traits and interests.
Her interest for the Tintin series is rooted mainly in the character himself.
“Tintin is a moral character. He’s an all-around good character who goes on adventures, and we all want to go on adventures.”
Reid’s art will stay on display until November 27. Toronto Draws Tintin surrounds the launch of graphic novel The Adventures of Hergé, a biography of Tintin creator Georges Remi. The comic-biography’s illustrator, Stanislas Barthélémy (penname Stanislas) will also be in attendance.

The book launch at the Brewery on the night of November 27 will also close the art display, culminating in a silent auction, with the money raised going to the Canadian Comic Legends Legal Defense Fund (CCLLDF). The fund was set up after the 2008 arrest of Iowa comic fan Christopher Handley for the possession of “obscene” manga.
Handley was charged when a package addressed to him was intercepted by customs and found to contain drawings of minors involved in sexual acts. He was sentenced to six months in prison after a judge ruled the drawings were obscene material.
Like Handley, Hergé has needed defending. He began “The Shooting Star” in 1941, while he worked at the Nazi-collaborationist paper Le Soir. In its first edition, Tintin faces off against Blumenstein, a Jewish-American financier with a large hook-nose.
Later editions in the post-war era toned down his nose, and changed the name to “Bohlwinkel”. Hergé always responded to anti-Semetic accusations by saying, “that was the style then.” He never thought his Jewish stereotypes were any more offensive than jokes about the Scottish.
But Tintin is not Hergé. Tintin is an adventurer from a bygone era, and he continues to have a certain appeal to this generation. Hergé’s ouvere may be old, but Tintin is eternally young.
With every new generation, there are new art forms, and for Tintin, this means new adventures.

Lions could not complete the comeback
Lewis Chaitov
Staff Writer

The York Lions left the fans unsatisfied, as they lost their home opener 66-51 to the McMaster Marauders. The stands were full, with supporters present for both teams—each displaying their affection from play to play when their team dominated. Throughout the beginning stages, the Lions were able to keep par with McMaster but faltered in the later parts of the game.
The two teams seemed to be very sluggish in the first half of the game, with the score tied at 26-26. Rookie Hayley Finn put six points on the scoreboard and Kayla Pangos, in her third season at York, put nine points on the scoreboard. Finn and Pangos brought to the court in the first half what head coach Bill Pangos is trying to instill in all his players: speed and hustle.
“We had a player injured,” says Coach Pangos. “We really played well in the first half. The injury really hurt us. Our rotations were off, she is a key post we have, fatigue set in and defensively we struggled. But we still did some key things tonight hopefully we can come back tomorrow.”
The Lions really struggled—missing so many shots that should have passed through the net. McMaster focused on their strengths in the second half—which were otherwise non-existent in the first.
The Marauders outscored the Lions in the third and fourth quarters with Katie Knight leading the scoring, hitting four of five three-point attempts, matching Finn’s game stats. The Marauders dominated the boards, which gave the Lions fewer opportunities to score.
Lions players after the loss want to forget this game and move forward to winning the next.
The positives to take from this game are: Nadia Qahwash—in her normal hustle mode, stealing the ball away three times from Mcmaster. Brittany Szockyj—the team captain put seven points on the board. Llyandra Kerr—with seven strong rebounds off the boards. Courtney Osborne and Kayla Pangos both had five strong defensive rebounds. Last year rebounding off the boards seemed to be York’s major problem—the team has much improved in this statistic. With 19 games left in the season, this game was a wake up call.
The Lions need to come out strong and play hard all 40 minutes. A majority of this team worked out this off-season on their strength and conditioning, which has really improved this season. Just a little more fine tunings will bring this club around. The coach has lots of confidence in his new recruits.

The occupy protesters arrive at crossroads
Hamid Adem

Protesters of Occupy Toronto have made St. James Park their home since October 15, but the five-week sit-in has finally been legally ordered to leave the grounds.
Following the footsteps of Occupy Wall Street and its global counterparts, Toronto’s own occupation in St. James Park aimed to protest against corporate influence in society.
However, Occupy Toronto protesters decided to have a rally—titled “Evict Rob Ford”—and marched to Nathan Phillips Square November 19 before the final eviction decision was made.
From there, the marchers divided into two groups and took different routes to city hall, one making its way along Yonge and the other along Sherbourne.
Gaetam Heroux, who was teaching a workshop at the free school before the rally, says “the world is in crisis.”
“People are fighting today for the essentials to survive, they need income and housing and education to live,” says Heroux, adding that students should “become aware of the larger issues of the world that are going to have an effect on their standard of living.”
Throughout the entire march to city hall, Toronto Police officers were on foot and bicycles, stopping traffic on the way to ensure the safety of the protesters.
“We are here to facilitate everyone,” says Sherazar Shad, a police officer who is taking his Masters at York. “The police services are here to make people feel safe. If that means stopping traffic to help facilitate a peaceful protest, we are here to help.”
Though Officer Shad declined to comment about his opinion of the protest, he noted that the group has been very civil.
“They have been a very peaceful bunch,” he says. “We haven’t had to deal with them.”
And while many protesters have already moved out of the campsite since the eviction notices were distributed, others insist they will hold their ground.
A protester going by the name “Ronny” says he joined the occupation about a week after it started. He is one of those in charge of security in the camp, and already he sees the St. James Park group as a community.
“I see this as a community, everything is shared, everyone is helping each other out and coming to each other’s needs,” he says. “There are going to be bad apples that we have to deal with, but there are bad apples everywhere […] instead of spending money on ridiculous things, we should be spending it on [the] betterment of our people—send people to school.”
Now that the eviction notices have been legally authorized, we will see how the community reacts.
Ronny had one thing to leave us with: “If they come for [my tent], they’re going to have to take me with it.”
