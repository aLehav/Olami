This supplement started out as a critical look at how far women have come. It was going to ask, considering it’s the year 2013, is feminism still even necessary?
But I noticed a pattern when the first drafts of the articles started coming in.
I realized they were all about questioning what a woman was, and what a woman was supposed to be. The stories examined the expectations society sets for women, and the expectations we set for ourselves—the ones that tell us we should be thin but curvy, ladylike but sexy, career-oriented but dedicated mothers, smart but not too smart; certainly not smarter than men.
The stories in this supplement challenge these assumptions. Some of them feature women testing the boundaries of what is considered appropriate “feminine” behaviour, and others are about women pushing back at these boundaries when they get in their way.
So that is where the theme, “De/constructing Feminism,” comes from. It means both taking apart what a woman is supposed to be, while simultaneously constructing new, diverse images and ideas about women.
I’ve thought a lot about what I want to achieve with this supplement. And the truth is, I don’t want to make some grand statement on feminism or offer a sweeping solution to any of the questions mentioned above.
What I want is for people, women and men, to ask questions. I want to inspire a dialogue that questions what it means to be a woman in today’s society, and if one singular meaning is even possible.
And I want people to question the boundaries and rules set for us—that govern the way we should dress, the way we should speak, the way we should act, what things we should like, and even in what fields we should work, and for how long.
Because that’s the thing about boundaries. Once you know where they are, they become easier to cross. So, happy crossing.

While most stag shops are designed to service the needs of men, Good For Her finds its niche with female customers
“[As a young girl], even though I was thin and white, I didn’t see anyone in the media that looked like me,” says Carlyle Jansen, owner and founder of Toronto’s leading female-friendly sex shop, Good For Her, located at Bathurst and Harbord Streets.
Jansen felt she never looked good in long hair or girly clothes, so she compensated by wearing loose clothing, to hide her body, and cut her hair short.
Like many girls in their teens, the now exuberant Jansen not only felt uncomfortable with her body, but her sexuality as well. When she went through puberty, she found the thought of sex so repugnant she postponed engaging in sexual intercourse until her early 20s.  Even then, she says her discomfort never dissipated, and throughout the course of her sexual exploration, she found she could not reach orgasm with any of her partners.
Destitute and beleaguered, there seemed to be no solution for her sexual ineptitude. At age 28, she reached rock bottom when her then-boyfriend left her because she could not have an orgasm. But Jansen saw this moment as a calling that sex no longer be merely a complex assortment of gestural rhetoric.
Soon after, Jansen began to educate herself in the art of sex. Through workshops, literature, sex toys, and self-exploration, she became the guru of self-love, and found that she could reach climax with the aid of sex toys.
During her sister’s bridal shower, she taught her sister’s friends the mechanics of sex toys. Jansen says at that moment, she realized there were a multitude of women like her, who felt so uncomfortable with expressing their sexuality that they suppressed their desires, and became completely ignorant of all the possibilities of their sexuality.
In 1997, Jansen recognized this untapped market and decided to promote sexual education for women through the creation of her very own sex shop.
Designed to promote comfort and openness for its female customers, the shop resembles a humble home. Besides having a selection of sex toys that cater to every need, from 15-inch dildos to nipple stimulators that resemble mini-serrated pizza cutters, the shop also holds workshops for a variety of subjects, from learning how to talk dirty to how to give erotic massages.
Jansen also mentions that they have women and trans-only hours, from 12 to 5 p.m. on Sundays because female customers often feel uncomfortable buying products in the presence of men.
“As a women and trans-friendly shop, it is a key resource for people exploring their sexuality. It’s a non-judgmental space,” says Michael Jackman, a sixth-year media and sexuality student and PhD candidate.
“Most sex-shops are geared towards men and are not inviting for women. But Good for Her provides that space where women feel safe.”
When asked what the source of this discomfort is, Jansen says from a young age women are socialized into thinking sex is immoral and their genitals are ugly. When it comes to intercourse, she says women often feel guilty about asking for what they want in bed and that they are boring their partners.
Jansen believes all the pressures placed on women to be successful, look perfect, and be good mothers, partners, and daughters can cause women to shut down sexually, and consciously stop thinking about things like being good lovers because they’re so busy trying to be everything else.
Jansen says many of these unrealistic pressures experienced by women are visible in mainstream pornography because the actresses all fit into a single mold—thin, hairless, white, large-breasted—and are capable of reaching orgasm within minutes. Also, much of the sex in these movies is tailored to the service of men, while the focus on authentic female pleasure is very minimal.
As a proprietor solely interested in the sexual education of women, the inclusion of mainstream porn in her shop would be extremely detrimental because it homogenizes female desires, promotes violence against women, and centralizes the penis. Jansen argues that ultimately, mainstream porn fails on every level as an educational tool.
Sixteen years ago, she says there was not a lot to choose from in the market of female-friendly porn. As the industry grew, however, Jensen says the production of porn was no longer an elitist practice, and more and more marginalized groups like women and transsexuals began making their own porn.
The feminist porn offered in the shop depicts genuine female pleasure, agency, and desire. It celebrates the plurality (ethnicity, sexual orientation, body type, and age) of all women, and operates mainly through an anti-oppressive framework. But most importantly, it promotes the equal treatment of women, as well as safe sex practices.
A few years ago, Jansen even decided to create an event to award these female-friendly porn stars, directors, and producers.
Dubbed the Feminist Porn Awards, the event garnered so much attention from a variety of workers in the industry that it spawned a recurring annual celebration for female, race, gay, lesbian, transsexual, and inter-sexual-friendly porn.
Heading into its eighth year, the event has grown substantially, spanning two days: the first day, a showcase of directors’ work at Bloor Cinema, and the second, the gala award ceremony.
Apart from the Feminist Porn Awards, Jansen also intends on participating in Vajanuary, the female equivalent for Movember, which requires that one’s pubic hair not be shaven until the end of the month, with the proceeds going to towards charity.
Though the war for recognizing sexual equality and education for women is not one that can be won overnight, Jansen believes that her utopia is attainable.
The key to this empowerment, says Jansen, is “celebrating your body and desires as they are, not comparing yourself with other women, educating yourself, accepting who you are, and not trying to make yourself like everyone else.”

Using The Devil Wears Prada as an example, Olivia Chandler points out the breadth and depth of power the fashion industry holds

A scene from The Devil Wears Prada features Andy (Anne Hathaway) chuckling at Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the Editor-in-Chief of “Runway Magazine” (a thinly-veiled allusion to Vogue), when she is trying to choose between two cerulean belts.
Miranda does not hesitate to tell her, “You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select… I don’t know… that lumpy blue sweater, for instance, because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. That blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs, and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff.”
Her words are certainly true in today’s world. But while fashion has the ability to destroy a woman’s self-esteem, it can also empower her.
The relationship between feminism and fashion has been, and still is, a tumultuous one. During the second wave of feminism, the New York Radical Women’s group protested at the 1968 Miss America Pageant and tossed items associated with femininity—high heels, false eyelashes, makeup, tweezers, curlers, girdles, fashion and beauty magazines, corsets and bras—into the “Freedom Trash Can.”
It is difficult to argue against critics who say the fashion industry objectifies women and upholds beauty standards unattainable for the average woman. The industry sends messages that influence us, telling us how we should value ourselves and determine our self-worth. Instead of valuing ourselves based on our accomplishments, intelligence, and personal strengths, we are instead told that our self-worth is measured by our material possessions.
In the case of fashion, it’s what or who you are wearing. Women are continually pressured to contribute to this vicious cycle and wear the latest trends. We are told we need to own that glamorous $2,000 Chanel handbag most can’t afford.
But fashion touches the lives of women every single day. The argument of being “anti-fashion” for anyone, feminist or not, would be hard to support.
Consider this: fashion is integral to society; we make decisions about what clothes to wear every single day. A person generally wears six to 10 articles of clothing a day, not including accessories. This forces women to make a choice every day. We can either choose not to care what we look like, which some don’t, or we can choose to conform to what the industry standards are, which most of us do.
Women have the ability to use fashion to their advantage and reclaim it as a form of empowerment, and not destruction. We can use it as a form of resistance against the socially constructed norms that dictate the “proper” way to dress.
Fashion should be used creatively and as a form of self-expression. If there was no fashion industry, we would not have any diversity. We most likely would have to conform to wear the same things, and who likes conformity? How boring.
Fashion is also another form of communication; we use it to communicate our personality, mood, beliefs, social or political views, and cultures.
Ultimately, fashion is a personal choice. Feminist or not, it is a powerful tool that has yet to be used to its full potential.
But in order for women to use fashion for social change, we must first change among ourselves. We have become too critical of one another, especially when it comes to what we wear. Instead, we should rise up to encourage and support women who go against fashion norms.
Whether you love fashion or don’t, whether you love to wear sneakers or eight-inch heels, whether you like to show a little more skin or enjoy covering up, fashion should not be used as means by which women judge each other. No woman should feel as if she is setting back feminism if she loves fashion,
As Minh Ha T. Pham wrote in the January issue of Ms., a feminist magazine, “If feminists ignore fashion, we are ceding our power to influence it.”

Film and television create ambiguous sexual expectations by not explicitly showing consent being given

In the second-season premiere of Girls, there’s a moment where one of the characters, Shoshanna, is having a dispute with her lover, Ray. It escalates. She’s walking away. He grabs her and pulls her back, forcibly kissing her. She relents. They have sex.
This is a question that was posited to me a few weeks ago, and has since been turning over in my head: how often is sexual consent given in film and television? And extending from whatever the probable answer is (hint: almost never), what does it mean?
What’s shocking is the lack of statistical documentation about this. There hasn’t been a single study done on approach and consent in film. It’s simply there, and taken for granted, which is intensely troubling.
I’ve been trying to think of films and shows in which a kiss is approached with consent, and I have trouble listing more than five. There are more than a few scenes I can think of that can easily be counted as rape, the aforementioned one in Girls being one of them.
It’s a sign of a society in which sexism has, because of the reductive processes of equality, become more subtle, an ingrained behaviour rather than an active decision, and this is one of the ways it manifests itself.
We’re often primed to reject violence, while love and intimacy are expected. The cues for sexual behaviour are taken from our own social learning and what we absorb from the media. This is only strengthened as we age and are fed the same concepts. From watching the Prince kiss Snow White,all the way to watching Booth Jonathan aggressively accosting Marnie in Girls, expectations develop around the way things occur, especially in the power-tipped patriarchal side.
It’s from these expectations that we get things like nice-guy syndrome and rape culture. For all its sophistication, mass media operates in almost storybook terms when it comes down to simple intimacy. Even worse, it normalizes the idea that not asking for consent yields positive results. It’s these small, significant ideas that are omnipresent, constantly holding back gender equality.
All of this comes down to the idea of responsibility in entertainment. Director Mike Figgis once said, “All films are science fiction films,” which is true, to an extent. They posit situations, scenarios, and people out of nothing, leading us to lives that, no matter how unremarkable they are, always operate on heightened levels of reality.
But to say that a film isn’t informed by the culture at large would be ignorant. Girls demonstrates a close-to-life aesthetic and has become something of a cultural trend-setter, both in how it speaks to the emotions of people in its target audience, and how it informs the programming that has come afterwards. It’s a show that prides itself on having realistic depictions of sex scenes. So then, why can’t it have realistic depictions of physical communication and approach?
Of course, Girls is one piece of entertainment out of countless others that do this. It’s the norm in most media portrayals of intimacy. The show demonstrates a lack of awareness and illustrates how far we still have to go to become egalitarian. It’s…something to work on.

The sexual assault of Jyoti Singh sparks protests in demand of women’s rights

News of the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman, Jyoti Singh, on the streets of Delhi, India’s capital, outraged the world this past December. More importantly, it has caused Indian society to question its treatment of women.
“I feel disgusted calling myself a man and not being able to help that girl who fell prey to those animals,” says Chirag Thakkar, a political science student at Delhi University.
“However, I see immense hope in the protest-scape of India. Twelve thousand charged and angry youngsters outside the president’s house crying for justice is not an ordinary event. It definitely brought the complacent and power-mongering statesmen to come out of their slumber and respond.”
Thakkar is referring to the mass protests that started in New Delhi as news about the rape case reached the public through news and social media. Thousands protested at India Gate and Raisina Hill, the location of both the Parliament of India and Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president of India. The protests soon spread to other parts of India as well as abroad.
This massive public outcry led to the creation of a special commission and a fast-track court being commissioned. Currently, five men stand trial for the rape and murder of Singh.
Significant change, however, requires a consideration of India’s history and culture.
In the year 1947, with the end of colonialism and the formation of a nation-state, a new chapter started in the story of an ancient civilization. Today, 65 years after independence, 21st-century India is caught up in the debate between tradition and modernity.
Gender inequality is deeply entrenched in Indian society, but this runs counter to Hindu values. According to Hindu traditions, goddesses are worshipped because they bring wealth, wisdom, and strength.
However, today the very practitioners of Hinduism look down upon girls as financial burdens for families, who must marry off any female children and pay their dowries.
Mitra Joshi, news reporter for CNBC TV-18 in Mumbai, reflects on these contradictions.
“On one hand, we worship Durga [a Hindu goddess] and her numerous forms in the temple, but when it comes to women in the house or the womb, she is treated as an unwanted commodity. All our society needs is a son. Why?” asks Joshi.
“Unless, and until, women themselves stand up against these atrocities, nothing will change,” says Joshi. “But women are told to keep quiet and endure the violence, or else they will be stigmatized by the society.”
Today, the Indian judicial system is adapting to seek justice not only for Singh but also for every Indian woman who has been a victim of gender-based violence. But there are no quick fixes to end the injustice.
“All along, we have been denying the noise this issue deserves. The anger had to pour out on the streets, at protest sites, in cyberspace, and in the media,” says Thakkar.
“I believe that some seeds of change have been sown and that they shall germinate. The tree shall bloom, not by living in denial, but by being constantly at war with patriarchy.”
