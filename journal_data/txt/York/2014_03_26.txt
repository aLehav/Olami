Walking through Vari Hall, fourth-year psychology major Tamika Johnson picks up a York region newspaper. Messages of gun violence, theft, and other crimes run rampant through its pages, with the finger of disapproval constantly pointed towards members of her own community, Jane and Finch.
Johnson skims the pages with a familiar feeling of dismay. The picture of Jane and Finch’s youth population is painted clearly in the paper’s narrative: troublesome, delinquent, and even criminal.
Johnson, 27, was born in Jamaica. She is a former resident of the Jane and Finch area. The community has always held a special place in her heart, but it is aggrieved by the constant stereotyping of its inhabitants.
Perpetuated by popular media, the “danger” myth of Jane and Finch is widespread—even amongst York students and faculty, a population situated mere minutes away. Johnson recognizes that a communication barrier between York and the Jane and Finch community has resulted in a damaging reputation for the neighbourhood.
“I think the relationship between York and the Jane and Finch community needs a lot of work. It’s an institution versus [the Jane and Finch community’s] youth, and youth in the media are either seen as unable to represent themselves or as rebellious,” says Johnson. 
Johnson has taken a stand against the stigmatization of her heart and home by founding Boss Magazine. While others dwell on mainstream media stories of gun violence and poverty, Johnson works ardently to inspire a better informed public.
The youth-led Boss aims to dispel the danger myth of the neighbourhood by showcasing positive activities of the Jane and Finch community and its vibrant youth population. The publication covers a range of lifestyle and fashion topics to appeal to a diverse audience.

“There was nothing for us to voice our own views of what we like, what’s really happening in the community, and the creative vision that youth have,” says Johnson on the pre-Boss Magazine era.
Johnson has attempted to engage the York population by reaching out to students, specifically those interested in fashion and business, and encouraging them to get involved with the magazine.
“[York] shouldn’t be a separate entity from the area,” she says. “It is part of the Jane and Finch community, it should have a mandate to engage.”
Johnson continues, “There are a lot of students that are [at York] for writing, and I wanted to give them a platform to [promote] their own talents.”
Currently, Johnson is still looking for more York students to work with Boss. She wants the magazine to be a vehicle for talent and to bring in youth to be a part of a project they can be proud of.
Johnson is extremely proud of her accomplishments with the magazine thus far. For her, the overwhelmingly positive reaction to Boss Magazine from the Jane and Finch community is its own reward.
“People from the community opened the magazine and saw themselves,” she says. 
Johnson feels strongly that reconnecting York and the Jane and Finch community will be mutually beneficial because their proximity allows them to share resources.
Lorna Schwartzentruber, manager of York University’s Community Engagement Centre, is deeply focused on repairing the relationship between the two communities as well.
“Most understandings of the Jane and Finch community don’t reflect its reality. Stereotypes have been processed year after year, and students don’t often take the time to experience the community, which perpetuates a power imbalance,” says Schwartzentruber. “We need to challenge some of those stereotypes by getting a more holistic view of the community.”
The Community Engagement Centre is making efforts to strengthen university’s ties to the community by making York a better neighbour.
“York has a social responsibility as a large organization to be a good neighbour, and contribute in positive ways to the community it is a part of,” says Schwartzentruber. 
Their “Student Orientation to Working in Jane and Finch,” for example, will pilot this September in an effort to unpack some of the issues faced by this community for students so they may better understand systemic oppression in marginalized communities and be able to engage with the community without fear or judgment.
Schwartzentruber strongly feels that this is just the beginning of uniting York with Jane and Finch. “Through community engagement, we can increase the learning potential for students, while simultaneously strengthening the community,” she says.
Natalie Coulter, a communications studies professor at York, is another strong advocate for community engagement. Through her classes, she has given her students the opportunity to participate in various community engagement projects with different organizations in the Jane and Finch region.
“I hope [York students] have a new understanding of [the] richness of the community that goes beyond school,” says Coulter. “I hope when students leave [York], they are proud that they both went to York University and that York University is in the Jane and Finch community.”
“The separation is not just physical—it’s also in terms of knowing and understanding the community,” she says. “I realize that there are incredibly rich resources in this community that represent a huge array of opportunities for students.”
Projects like Johnson’s and Coulter’s provide a channel of communication between the two communities that students can get involved in.
Johnson is amazed that Coulter’s students have become involved with the magazine, and this exemplifies how Boss is one step closer to reaching this common goal.
Although Johnson is excited about the current progress and attention to these initiatives, she realizes there is much more work to be done, and that the process will be an arduous one.
As a York student and a Jane and Finch native, the burden of the stigma against her community is her own, and it pains her to see her school and her home at odds when the media so often targets them both. But she is hopeful that more people will join her fight for change. When that happens, the students of York and the people that make up Jane and Finch may stand together in a celebration of diversity, talent, and a sense of unity.

There’s been a dialogue about whether switching to an online voting system would be a better way forward for York Federation of Students elections.
To me, this is sort of like a debate on whether or not you should find a place to live by looking at pictures online and sending your first and last deposit by email transfer or by doing your research and then going in person to ensure you are getting what you’re paying for. Sure, the former is convenient and might save some time, but the risks are far too great for my liking.
We have seen far too many examples of elections going horribly wrong when online voting is employed, and these many instances of corruption give me doubts about the true integrity of the online elections.
The Western Gazette reported that in 2012, their university students’ council elections had been hacked by a former student, “who took advantage of a weakness in the site,” and that all 10,000 votes were invalidated, requiring a re-vote to be held two weeks later.
Similarly, in 2013, “poorly-timed human error lead to voters being presented with the wrong choices.”
At the University of British Columbia, in an online vote held in 2010, The Ubyssey reported that people were able to log in, clone the voting page, and submit fake ballots. This resulted in 731 ballots being submitted from a single IP address, alerting the elections committee that something was wrong.
Unsurprisingly, the votes were thrown out, but whoever received the extra 731 votes could have won if the flaw wasn’t discovered. And of course, students were a little angry at the system that allowed this to happen.
Recently, Queen’s University students saw their fall referendum postponed by a day because a miscommunication between the software behind their online voting system and their email server resulted in 6,000 email ballot logins not being sent out.
I think you see the trend here. The list goes on.
Let’s also acknowledge that in Canada, our federal, municipal and provincial elections operate on paper ballots.
The paper ballot voting system does not work at the touch of a button, but at least we know it’s a system that allows the integrity of the elections to stay intact.
At the end of the day, I like knowing I can have my space to vote without someone looming over my computer, that the candidates can’t hack in and vote for themselves 1,000 times over, and that people won’t be prevented from accessing the system due to glitches.
You can keep your “convenient” shortcut—I would much rather spend the time on ensuring quality.

I was banned from York University almost a year ago for exercising my freedom of expression by organizing and participating in a peaceful protest for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions and against York’s investments in weapons manufacturers.
The administration singled me out as an instigator, and they now may be attempting to paint me as an outsider to the York community.
Despite the dubious claim that I was banned for disrupting classes during the protest (York’s own local adjudicator found no disruption), I initially received a letter from VP Students Janet Morrison stating: “The University does not give permission for members of the public—including alumni—to enter our campus lands for protests or demonstrations, or to engage in forms of speech or action that are, in any way, racist or that advocate racism, violence, or hatred.”
Aside from the fact that alumni participate in on-campus protests regularly, Morrison’s statement raises the question of whether I was banned for disruption, for my political beliefs, or because I’m Palestinian. The fact that York Security threatened another Palestinian alumnus with arrest and trespass makes the question more pressing.
Moreover, former director of Security Services, Rob Kilfoyle told Office of Student Conflict Resolution Director Debbie Hansen by email that although my status as an alumnus complicates things, he “would love to” trespass me.
In another instance of disregard for the role of alumni, when SAIA met with the administration, VP Academic Rhonda Lenton refused to include me because “the offer was made to meet with current members of the York community.”
I feel compelled to state my history at York, for the record.
I was a student of psychology and political science from 2001 to 2007. The attacks of September 11 occurred after I arrived to Canada and following my frosh week.
My world was changed.
I became radicalized as bombs fell over Afghanistan and Iraq, and as the second Palestinian uprising was crushed under blood-soaked tank treads and the rubble of thousands of demolished Palestinian homes.
That’s when I joined the anti-war movement and, through the mentoring of a group of Iraqi students, honed the skills of activism.
I was co-founder of Amnesty International at York, a member of Now End War and Sanctions on Iraq, an executive member of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, and a member of the Grass-Roots Anti-Imperialist Network.
I took part in the barricading of the entrances to campus on March 10, 2003, and helped to organize lectures, film screenings, and protests.
I worked for the Student Christian Movement at York and for the York University Telemail Program. I was elected to the York Federation of Students as the Stong College director, submitted articles for Excalibur and the YU Free Press, sang with the York University Choir, and performed with Vanier College Productions.
I experienced the corporatization of campus, repressive changes to university policies, and the numerous sanctions imposed on outspoken students and faculty as a result of those changes.
I went to pub nights when Founder’s Cock&Bull and Calumet’s On the Edge were more popular than The Underground. I lived at Stong Residence and Assiniboine. I walked through the graffiti-laden, weed-scented underground tunnels before they were closed, pulled all-nighters alone at the Student Centre and watched the sun rise from rooftops.
After I lost my home in Palestine, the York community became another home to me. York and I even share the same birthday. So rest assured, I am here to stay, and attempts at erasing my history at York University have already failed.

BDS is a campaign that marginalizes Jewish and pro-Israeli students. Whether or not you agree with their values, they have legitimate opinions from a different perspective. They are paying students trying to get an education. You’ve already paid your dues and you are preventing them from getting an education. Move on.
And fight your cause somewhere else.
You’ve got to get rid of this “us vs. them” mentality. It’s extremely unproductive and totally misrepresents the work of these activists at York University.
This is not an issue of Palestine vs. Israel. This is an issue of whether a public institution which ostensibly promotes itself as an advocate for social justice and human rights issues uses tuition dollars to invest in bombs, guns and other weapon paraphernalia to kill other human beings across the world.
It is a matter of morality.
To distort the BDS argument as simply, “marginalization of pro-Israeli students” misses the point entirely and confines the divestment argument to an entirely self-imposed narrative that comes from one’s own insecurity and fear of the “other”.
There is only one side, that is humanity.
Without a doubt York is an organization feasting on our tax dollars, with low educated lifers making 6 figures and completely unqualified for the positions they occupy. Disgusting.

[su_heading size=”21″]Witnesses are now being called to the stand in the trial of Brian Dickson, the man accused of killing York student Qian Liu in her Village home in 2011.[/su_heading]
On the second day of the trial, the jury heard several witness accounts of what happened the day Liu’s body was first discovered in her Aldwinkle Heights residence.
Faquan Zeng, Liu’s landlord at the time; Alvin Yuhalogarasan, a paramedic who responded; and Toronto police sergeant Eric Dugan took the stand on March 25 to explain what they saw on April 15, 2011.
Zeng explained through a translator that he had received a message stating Liu might be in danger before rushing over to the residence to check if she was okay.
In her opening statements, Crown attorney Christine Pirraglia outlined how Liu’s former boyfriend (who had seen her struggle with a man over webcam the night before) had contacted her friends.
They eventually relayed the information to a tenant in the house, who then contacted Zeng.
[su_pullquote align=”right”]“We shouted Qian’s name, [but] we got no response, so we used the [master] key,” said Zeng’s translator.[/su_pullquote]
Zeng says he shouted Liu’s name a few more times and then opened the door and saw Liu lying on the floor.
According to Pirraglia, Liu’s body was faced down on the floor, naked from the mid-chest down with a nightgown pulled up around her chest. The Crown also noted Liu’s body had a white dry substance located on the upper thigh and groin area when found.
It was later determined that the substance was semen.

Yuhalogarasan, a paramedic who responded, says after examining her arm, he determined resuscitation would be futile.
“She was pronounced dead with rigor mortis,” says Yuhalogarasan, explaining rigor mortis is when joints become stiff and is a clear sign of death.
The Crown attorney stated on March 24 that Liu had died from mechanical asphyxia involving some form of neck compression.
Police sergeant Dugan explained on the stand that Liu was lying face down with blood coming from each side of her head, matching the photos displayed in court on March 24.
In the busy courtroom, Liu’s family listened in with earphones, as a translator helped them understand every single word said in the trial. The family stayed silent as each witness described what they saw in the Village home.
In her opening statement, Pirraglia revealed more details on how Liu was allegedly killed.
Around 1 a.m., Liu was chatting online with her former boyfriend Xian Meng in Beijing. She heard a knock on her door, said Pirraglia. Meng then saw a man attempt to hug Liu before pushing his way into her bedroom and knocking her webcam off the computer.
“He shoved Ms. Liu causing her to fall off camera in the direction of her bed,” said Pirraglia. “Mr. Meng, no longer able to see any images, heard Ms. Liu saying the word ‘no’ in both English and Mandarin.”
Pirraglia said after two muffled bangs, Meng never heard Liu’s voice again, and before the screen was shut, he saw the man approach the computer, naked from the waist down.
Robert Nuttall, the lawyer representing Dickson, asked the jury to return with a verdict of manslaughter, stating at the beginning of the trial, “This is not a case of who did it; this is a what happened case.”
He also stated that the jury members should pay close attention to the forensic evidence.
Dickson’s trial is expected to last three to four weeks with a 14-member jury.
A doctor who examined the body is expected to testify as a witness on March 25, along with Detective-Sergeant Frank Skubic, a lead investigator in the case.

[su_heading size=”21″]Students and faculty members were agitated last week when a widespread network outage shut down York’s web-based services. [/su_heading]MyMail, Moodle, the York homepage, and Flex accounts were all affected by the outage, which started at 7:20 p.m. on March 19.
Christopher Russel, director of ICT infrastructure and information security officer at York, says the outage was caused by a breaker being tripped during inclimate weather on the evening of March 19.
This caused a power outage on the Keele campus, and University Information Technology supply units failed. Some elements of York’s core network then lost power.
“With some exceptions, nearly all services were affected since they rely on the network,” says Russel.
“In some cases the service itself was still functioning, but it wouldn’t have been possible to connect to it. Parts of the network, including internet access for Keele campus student residences, were not directly impacted and continued to function.”
Pardis Aliakbarkhani, a third-year professional writing and anthropology student, says, “I had an assignment due that night through Moodle, and I was locked out of everything York-related. It was really frustrating.”
Between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on March 20, nearly all services affected by the outage were restored. Some services however, were not fully restored until midday on March 20.
Russel says a network error would not allow for correct diagnosis of network problems right away, and technical teams referred to a process of elimination to figure out what the problems were.
“In all, over 800 servers and systems were checked on and brought back into service,” says Russel.
Russel says scenarios like this have been successfully tested in the past.
UIT is currently working with the network vendor to ensure this problem is fully understood to reduce chances of this happening again.

The election voting period for CUPE 3903, the union that represents York’s contract faculty, teaching assistants, graduate assistants, and research assistants, has been extended to the end of this week as neither candidate for chair received more than 50 per cent of the votes.
The third candidate was dropped from the ballot since he did not have enough votes, leaving only Faiz Ahmed and Christina Rousseau running for chair. According to CUPE 3903’s bylaws, the union must have a run-off election for this position.
The run-off election runs until March 28.

Three York employees were arrested in relation to a fraud that occurred at York over seven years.
The fraud, alleged to have occurred between November 2005 and October 2012, is estimated to have cost the university $1.6 million. Police allege the employees issued fake invoices to the university.
Toronto Police announced the arrests on March 20. This is an ongoing investigation, and police expect more arrests to be made and further charges to be laid.
Vittoria Caparello is being charged with two counts of fraud over $5,000, Yossi Zaidfeld is charged with one count of fraud over $5,000, and Melissa Caparello faces a charge of possession of property obtained by crime of under $5,000.
Malissa Caparello is still employed as an administrative assistant in the dean’s office at the faculty of environmental studies and has been employed by the university since January 2005.
In regards to the future of her employment status, Joanne Rider of York media says the university is currently doing a review of the matter, and once a decision has been made, appropriate action will be taken.
“As soon as the university was informed that there was a suspicion of fraud, we did two things: we informed the police and we engaged an external firm to conduct a forensic audit,” says Rider.
“The university has already recovered the money estimated to be lost plus additional costs since the university initially found out about the alleged fraud in October of 2012,” she says.
York was notified of the fraud when a whistleblower came forward with the information around the same time the university implemented new policies and procedures to detect fraud, says Rider. 
These policies were developed following a 2012 case in which two former York executives were accused of taking part in a massive phony invoice scheme and of defrauding the university of $1.2 million.
The Theft, Fraud and Misappropriation of Funds Policy developed as a result helped strengthen the university’s controls against fraud. The changes included an updated whistleblower policy, a conflict of interest policy, and the implementation of a comprehensive fraud risk assessment initiative.
“So it was at that time an individual came forward and indicated that they suspected suspicious activity,” says Rider.
As part of this policy, the identity of the whistleblower remains confidential.

Prominent York faculty and community members spoke in the Student Centre on March 25 to publicize alleged violations of student rights and civil liberties by York’s administration.
Professors David McNally, John Greyson, and Penni Stewart, as well as CUPE 3903 Chairperson Faiz Ahmed and alumnus Hamman Farah all spoke at the event.
Farah, who was banned from campus in the spring of 2013 following a rally held by Students Against Israeli Apartheid, says administrators cannot be allowed to continue to intimidate and harass students in unrestrained manner. 
Farah also points to York’s revocation of SAIA’s club status on March 27, 2013, as an example of this harassment and intimidation from York’s administration.
Despite being banned from campus, Farah still spoke at the event.
Joanne Rider of York media responded to Excalibur’s request for comment via email, stating that freedom of expressions is one of York’s guiding principles.
“Members of the York community have the right to express their views and to test and challenge ideas, provided they do so within the law, and in a peaceful and non-threatening manner that does not disrupt academic activity,” Rider continues. 
She also adds that York’s responsibility is to protect the academic environment, while ensuring all community members abide by agreed upon standards of conduct, which allow students to pursue their studies “free from unwelcome disruptions.”
“York has and will continue to ensure these policies are communicated, understood, and adhered to in a consistent manner,” says Rider.
The event was not prevented by York administration, as it was approved by the Student Centre board and included participation from the York Federation of Students.
Farah is pushing for York to amend their Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, the Senate Policy on Disruptive and/or Harassing Behaviour in Academic Situations, and the Temporary Use of University Space policy to reflect Canadian values of freedom of expression.
“Free speech and free assembly are important to students,” he says. “This is where we learn the most about these basic democratic values, and where the most opportunities arise to exercise them.”
David McNally, a political science professor, spoke out in support of SAIA and Farah. Hereferenced a letter signed by 150 faculty members urging the administration to recognize civil rights violations and begin amending policies on the use of student space and the student code of conduct.
“You cannot maintain any of kind of democratic culture in a society unless basic rights to express opinions and assemble on behalf of those opinions is secure,” says McNally.
He cites the treatment of SAIA and Farah as a specific problem within York’s democratic culture. McNally also believes the York administration is attempting to “roll back the gains that student and social movements have made in regards to free speech and free assembly, particularly those with dissenting opinions.”
“Speaking as a political scientist, I don’t see how I can go into my classes and try to transmit to students the importance of basic civil rights in a democratic society, and then not speak out when I see my own administration violating them,” he says.
McNally says the event will only have been successful if it contributes to increasing pressure on the York administration to “get serious about civil rights and student rights.”

That is ridicuous. The author fails to mention that SAIA is by the the most harassing and intimidating (well they try) club on campus. Outrageous to protest in a lecture hall and disrupt class, that WE PAY FOR AND NEED TO GRADUATE, and then get the appropriate punishment as agreed upon in the contracts with the school on behavior codes. And then play the victim? Whack
SAIA harasses students (the white poppy thing on Remembrance day) and administrators (screamed violently and disrupted York’s Birthday and insulted President Shoukouri). Not to mention violently barricading Jewish students in the Hillel office in 2009 where the police had to be called. Peaceful protests?? get your head examined
