Did you know Halloween’s iconic jack-o’-lantern bears its roots in an old Irish folktale about a man named Stingy Jack?
Jack was out one night drinking with the devil when the former convinced the latter to magically turn himself into a coin, as part of a scheme to obtain free drinks. Then, Jack put the devil-now-coin in his pocket, along with a silver cross that prevented him from transforming back.
‘I promise to free you as long as you won’t bother me for a year,’ bargains Jack. ‘And when I die, you can never claim my soul!’
That was only Jack’s first trick. The second occurred when he carved a cross into a tree while the devil was in the branches picking out a piece of fruit, at Jack’s behest. This bought Jack another 10 devil-free years.
But when Jack died, god rejected him from heaven. Since the devil couldn’t claim his soul either, Jack was sent to roam the darkness of purgatory forever, with only a burning coal for light. He decided to put the coal into a turnip, to act as a lantern to guide his lost soul.
Based on this folktale, the Irish began carving creepy faces into turnips, beets and potatoes to scare away Stingy Jack, or any other spirits of the night on October 31. They also placed candles in these vegetables, and left them on their doorsteps to help guide lost spirits home.
Stingy Jack became ‘Jack of the Lantern’ and the rest is history!
So if you think about it, Halloween is actually more Irish than St. Patrick’s Day, since the latter was invented by Irish-Americans in America. Whereas the spooktacular day originates from the ancient Celtic festival of “Samhain,” meaning “summer’s end” in Gaelic.
Not many know the origins of Halloween, and yet a whopping number of people and money are invested in the day.
Nicholas Rogers, distinguished research professor and professor of history at York, wrote a book titled Halloween: from pagan ritual to party night. According to Rogers, About 65 per cent of American adults participate in Halloween beyond handing out candy. “Roughly $1.5 billion is spent every year on costumes, and a further $3 billion on party accessories.”  So shoppers, wouldn’t a little historical context behind this year’s Halloween-related VISA payments be intriguing?
Two thousand years ago, the Celts, who lived in what is currently Ireland, celebrated their new year on November 1. As previously mentioned, Halloween originates from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. Its significance centres around the end of harvest season, and the beginning of winter, or the ‘darker half’ of the year—now often associated with human death.
“Paired with the feast of Beltane, which celebrated the life-generating powers of the sun,“ Rogers wrote, “Samhain beckoned to winter and the dark nights ahead. It was quintessentially ‘an old pastoral and agricultural festival.’”
Although not all historians can reach a consensus on what went on during the Samhain feast, there is one agreed-upon element renowned in Halloween’s legacy: its omens, propitiations, and links to the otherworld.
It is said that the Celts believed that on the eve of their new year which ended summer, the door dividing the worlds of the living and the dead opened.
As a result, people felt close to deceased relatives and friends. For the ‘friendly’ spirits, they left treats on doorsteps, and candles along the side of the road to help loved ones find their way back to the spirit world. (Thank you Stingy Jack!)
To further commemorate the event, Celtic priests built massive bonfires where people burned crops and animals as sacrifices to deities. During the celebration, the Celts wore costumes made of animal heads and skins. They also partook in fortune-telling activities.
Sir James Frazer popularized the notion that Samhain was a festival of the dead and a night where souls would visit their old homes. However, Rogers adds that we should be wary of this description of Halloween “for it seems probable Frazer confused the rites associated with All Souls’ Day with those that preceded it.”
In fact, there is no hard evidence that Samhain was specifically and primarily devoted to the dead.
Most of the conjecture that Halloween involves supernatural events and rites developed in conjunction with the medieval holy days of All Souls’ and All Saints’ Day in the Roman imperialization of Celtic lands.
During the 400 hundred years the Roman Empire conquered and ruled over the Celts, two Roman festivals were combined with Samhain. First was “Feralia” which commemorated the passing of the dead. Second was a day to honour the Roman goddess of fruit, Pomona.
According to Rogers: “Some folklorists have detected Halloween’s origins in the Roman feast of Pomona, the goddess of fruits and seeds, or in the festival of the dead called Parentalia.” But, nonetheless, it will always typically be linked to Samhain.
Eventually, Pope Boniface IV dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to all Christian martyrs, and chose a day in February to commemorate them. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III added saints to that list and moved the date to November 1. According to Rogers, this was because “saints could be important intercessors for departed souls facing divine judgment.”
So, November 1 became known as “All Saints Day,” which incorporated some Samhain traditions. The Day was also called “All-hallows” or “All-hallowmas” from the Middle English term Alholowmesse meaning All Saints’ Day. So it follows that the night before, October 31, became known as All Hallows Eve (Samhain).
What’s more, due to Christianity’s expansion into Celtic lands, Celtic rites were supplanted by their influence. The church then established November 2 as All Souls Day to honour the dead, which was very similar to Samhain/All Hallows Eve—a decision believed to be motivated by an attempt to establish a church-sanctioned holiday.
“Halloween is, quite literally, the popular derivative of All Hallows Even, or the eve of All Saints’ Day (1 November). Taken together with All Souls’ Day, which falls on November 2, it is a time assigned in the Christian calendar for honouring the newly departed,” explained Rogers.
It’s also safe to dismiss Halloween as anything to do with ‘satanic rituals’ or ‘satan’ himself, considering those were never elements of Samhain. “Satanism is essentially a Christian creation, a travesty of Christian forms centered on the fallen rebel angel, Lucifer,” wrote Rogers. “Certainly, Satanism was incompatible with the polytheism of the ancient Celts.”
Then, Halloween came to America!
In the second half of the 19th century, millions of Irish immigrants came to America fleeing the infamous Irish Potato Famine. According to Rogers, at the turn of the century, the Irish were the majority immigrant minority in the U.S. and Canada.They helped popularize the celebration of Halloween on a national scale.
For example, since turnips were hard to come by in the States at the time, pumpkins were used as an alternative to fend off ol’ Stingy Jack and help guide lost spirits.
Predictably and predominantly, however, Halloween started being celebrated in more commercial ways. Before, believe it or not, there was a time where Halloween in North America lost its spooky suave.
According to Rogers, this was likely an attempt to turn every Irish immigrant into a “putative middle-class citizen.”  The Montreal Gazette blamed this on the “civilizing” influence of North American cities, noting the spooky suave was declining in favour of more “literary or more rational enjoyments.”
Clearly, this didn’t completely stop us from adopting some fun traditions and making it our own.
One famous adopted tradition, which was revived between 1920 and 1950, is putting on costumes and knocking on houses asking for food or money, also known today as ‘trick-or-treating’. Celtic myth actually states that visiting ghosts would disguise themselves in human form and knock on the doors of the living during Samhain asking for money or food. The myth also stated that humans could dress up to fool evil spirits into thinking they were one of them.
By the 1920s and 1930s, vandalism began to plague some celebrations in many communities. By the 1950s, town leaders had successfully limited vandalism, and Halloween had evolved into a holiday directed mainly at the young. Due to the high number of young children during the 50’s baby boom, parties moved into the classroom or home.
Trick-or-treating was a relatively inexpensive way for an entire community to share the Halloween celebration. In theory, families could also prevent tricks being played on them by providing the neighbourhood children with small treats.
So, a new tradition was born out of yet another Irish-based custom, continued to grow, and is now one of the most commercialized.
Along with Stingy Jack, there is another iconic Halloween figure with surprising origins: the green witch with a pointy hat and warty nose stirring her ominous cauldron.
The ‘old hag’ originates from a pagan goddess known as “the crone” or “Earth mother” who was honoured during Samhain—Google it, there’s nothing appalling or green about her!
She originally symbolized wisdom, change, and the turning of the seasons. The pagan Celts also believed that all souls went into the crone’s cauldron. It symbolized the Earth mother’s womb. They awaited reincarnation where stirring the cauldron allowed new souls to enter and old souls to be reborn.
It’s shocking and interesting to learn how the traditions and symbols of the day have evolved so much when it was essentially a day for celebrating the end of the harvest season, honouring saints, and, as seen with ol’ Stingy Jack, the spooktacular day was also an occasion for praying for souls in purgatory.
What’s more interesting is the lengths entrepreneurs have gone in replicating and demorphing some of the narratives of Samhain to cash in on the ‘scariest’ night of the year.
“The amount of money spent on Halloween has more than doubled in the last decade,” Rogers said. “Making it the second-largest retail bonanza after Christmas.”

As hoards of people flock to Value Village to pick out their festive wear, it’s important to think about what is appropriate and what is not—and I’m not talking about cultural appropriation.
I love Halloween. I love dressing up, and doing FX makeup—it’s something you never really get to do any other time of the year. Halloween is all about becoming something you aren’t, or something you want to be, even if just for a night.
However, deciding on a Halloween costume is hard. Whether it’s deciding to dress warmly and comfortably, choosing to apply some heavy FX makeup (that you hope you remember to clean off your face at the end of the night in your drunken stupor), or letting it all out in an attempt to look sexy, the question remains: “What am I going to dress up as for Halloween?”
What I enjoy most about the holiday is when people unironically choose to dress up in a sexy costume of characteristically unsexy things.
In the Kardashian world, where we hold our booties to the highest honour over, say, creativity, it’s no surprise that flocks of individuals are dressing up as our favourite childhood characters with  a ‘sexy’ thrown into the title.
What isn’t creative is turning a Minion, one of the most annoying characters on the planet, into a ‘sexy Minion.’ Why all the skin? Even turning them into sex symbols isn’t going to help their reputation.
This isn’t to say all costumes are inappropriately sexy. Some are hilarious, some are cute—hell, some are downright attractive. For example, a mermaid tends to reside on the sexy side of costume ideas. Even Ariel, our beloved little mermaid, only wears a bra on-screen, but she still manages to do so tastefully.
Then there are the trashy types—people intentionally dressing to expose themselves. Aren’t you cold? It did snow recently. On the off-chance you aren’t dressing up as a porn star or Christina Aguilera circa 2002, I recommend you put that ass away. Your body temperature will thank you.
So, the next time you are rummaging through the skin-tight, barely-there costumes at your local thrift store, take a moment to reflect: If you have to ask yourself if it’s too much skin, it probably is.

Halloween—that time of year when a person is actively encouraged to be anybody but themselves, and people dress up to their heart’s content. Some do it for sheer enjoyment, others may have more political, or ideologically motivated intentions. Whatever reason it may be, there’s always something to look forward to, because people let their imaginations run wild. However, it’s when people take it too far and land a themselves in hot water, that they stop to think, ‘maybe this wasn’t the best idea.’
Superheroes (and some anti-heroes) seem to be all the rage this year. With Harley Quinn taking the reins amongst girls, comic book characters still seem to be at the forefront of many people’s minds. Spider-man and Black Panther are costumes which won’t be feeling a lack of love this Halloween. Dressing up as either seems to be harmless fun, yet one of these costumes worn a certain way can cause an uproar.
The conversation surrounding the practice of ‘blackface’ is at the zeitgeist’s forefront right now. ‘Blackface’ is when an individual dons makeup and deliberately darkens their skin. Lauren St. Bernard, a first-year health management student, doesn’t see the appeal. “If you’re painting your skin to be a different colour as a costume, that’s definitely not right. I mean dressing up as Barack Obama or Donald Trump, I don’t think that’d be quite of an issue, as long as you’re respectful with it because people have their different political views, but if you’re painting your skin to be a different colour, race or ethnicity for the character of the costume, that’s not okay.”
Some are not so quick to condemn it. Brijender Bommala, a second-year Seneca student says people should have more of an open mind and not judge others. “They can wear what they want if they’re comfortable with what they’re wearing”.
If coming from a sense of cultural appreciation, people should be allowed to dress as they please. In regards to ‘blackface’ Bommala says, “it depends on individuality and how they see themselves and how they like it, so if they paint their face black, it’s totally up to them and if they’re okay with it then we shouldn’t judge, or question it.”
It’s a normal response for someone to question why something such as ‘blackface’ should be off limits when it looks as if the person is just very committed to their art. However, there’s a historical context that is less known, which showcases why ‘blackface’ is not as harmless as people may think. It goes back to a time where performers would darken their faces, and portray unflattering representations of African-Americans.
In the post-Me-Too era, we live in a much more politically-conscious world. That begs the question, where is the line that decides what is appropriate and what is not? If dressing up as Kim Kardashian is ‘hot,’ then why isn’t cultural appropriation? Some may even say that is her everyday look.
Yandy, an online retail company recently pulled a sexy ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ costume from their shelves after backlash. The show is about female oppression and women who are forced into sexual servitude. This isn’t the only Halloween costume that has faced backlash. There are always people who tend to dress as something, that to some, can be offensive.
When asked if he believes certain costumes should be off limits, Father Marc Syrenne of Catholic Chaplaincy at York University said: “Personally—yes. Those would be the more occult and violent costumes. Someone with an axe stuck in their head for example.” When asked what he thinks would make an appropriate costume, he replied, “Coming from a Catholic perspective, dressing up as people we admire should be okay. I don’t have a problem with people dressing up as Tinkerbell or anything like that because not everyone is Catholic. The line is violence and the occult, and when their outfits are sexualized. Anything sexual—doesn’t have to be faith or church related—it’s just not an appropriate way of looking. To me, it promotes the issues of sexual revolution. It can’t promote sexual promiscuity.”
Allison Durzi, a second-year kinesiology student, says she wouldn’t do anything she feel is disrespectful—she would rather stick to animal costumes. “I don’t think people should dress as other people’s religions because I feel it’s disrespectful. You should go more towards basic costumes. The line that shouldn’t be crossed is if you’re dressing as a certain religion, but also making fun of it at the same time.”
There are a number of costumes that may seem harmless, but it’s because the underlying historical significance is overlooked. What is harmful, and what is seen as obscene; is it because people are ignorant or they just don’t care? Remember Prince Harry’s infamous Nazi costume (has Meghan seen it)? It seems as if dressing up as a Native American Chief or a terrorist is blown out of proportion by left-wing media and deemed racist, but it’s just another costume. 
In fact some costumes are seen as appreciating a culture and bringing awareness to it. That’s a solid argument, but here’s the thing—how can you dress up as a terrorist when technically speaking, terrorism has no face? It’s when a person puts a specific face to terrorism that the problem begins. Putting on a fake beard, and strapping an AK-47 to their chest and calling themselves a terrorist is racist because it is being modelled by people who look a specific way.
An anonymous first-year education student says that mocking people’s culture is not right and that is where the line should be drawn. “I think dressing up as a character that’s a person of colour such as Black Panther is fine, that’s fun for Halloween. There’s certain lines you can’t cross, like painting yourself black or doing obviously offensive things. I see people wearing Native American headdresses and stuff like that, and I think that’s not right.”
Nathan Allen, a first-year French studies student echoed these sentiments. “Respect people’s cultures and the significance of the garments that they wear and don’t just wear them randomly if you don’t appreciate, or at least understand what it’s about.”
Michael Millman a first-year political science student summed up the debate surrounding cultural appropriation and appreciation. “I think it’s a pretty fine line between what is okay and isn’t. Some costumes are inappropriate in the sense that it’s representation of some cultures are unfair or in a harsh light. So using norms in those cultures in a comedic way isn’t really appropriate for Halloween or any kind of costume.” Millman also believes common sense plays a factor into determining where the line is and when not to cross it. “Knowing it’s going to offend someone or not, you likely know what you’re doing when you’re creating a costume. It’s not appropriate to use other cultures in a comedic sense or just as a costume.”
This Halloween, take caution, and don’t let your choices come back to haunt you.

Featured Image: The rhythm of the film’s tricks quickly wears thin. | Bryden Doyle
In making a sequel to John Carpenter’s highly regarded slasher flick ‘Halloween,’ David Gordon Green has high expectations to live up to. Green’s visual flair occasionally enlivens the film, but he fails to build suspense or create ominous atmosphere.
It’s been 40 years since babysitter Laurie Strode’s (Jamie Lee Curtis) harrowing confrontation with masked killer, Michael Myers (Nick Castle). Laurie’s now a recluse living in the woods, estranged from her grown daughter Karen (Judy Greer), who doesn’t even want her own teenage daughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) talking to Laurie.
While Michael appears to be safely locked away in an insane asylum, Laurie’s spent the last four decades preparing for his return, so she can finally kill him.
Curtis’s performance is one of the film’s few highlights, playing Laurie as a woman so severely traumatized that she’s stopped caring about civility.
When a bus carrying Michael and several other mental patients crashes near his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael journeys home, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.
The original film wastes little time with exposition and sustains a high level of dread. In contrast, the new ‘Halloween’ wastes a lot of time stalling for Michael and Laurie’s reunion with half-baked subplots about a police chief (Will Patton) whose long-standing connection to Laurie is only established through vague, unconvincing dialogue and Karen’s resentment of Laurie.
Occasionally, Green and cinematographer Michael Simmonds construct some striking compositions. A shot of a man filling up his car at a gas station while a blurry Michael stalks across the frame in the background is chillingly understated.
Green’s scare tactics are disappointingly generic and one-note: Someone investigates an unusual noise in a mysteriously silent area. The silence is broken by a fake-out scare, followed by a brief moment of calm, before culminating in a grisly execution accompanied by a sharp music cue. The rhythm of the film’s tricks quickly wears thin.
On a more positive note, third-year visual art student Christina Bozios says of the film: “It was definitely creepy and  uncomfortable. I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but it definitely had me feeling ways. You literally feel like you are there, so for me I was literally squirming in my seat the whole time.”
Comic relief’s a reliable tension breaker in horror, but every time Green and co-writers Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley shoehorn humour into the film, it grinds the pacing to a halt.
During one violent action scene, the film cuts to a squad car with two cops who are talking about bánh-mì sandwiches. Done correctly, this could’ve been some amusing dramatic irony, but the indifferently written scene goes on for so long that it feels interminable.
John Carpenter himself returns to help compose the score. It’s similar to the 1978 keyboard themes, with some added electronic beats and electric guitar. Still, the music effectively fits the film’s tone—eerie, propulsive, and weirdly catchy.
Late in the film, there’s one genuinely surprising twist that temporarily upends expectations about the climactic resolution. However, the the film reverts back to formula all too soon.
There’ve been so many lesser sequels and remakes that have followed John Carpenter’s horror classic. David Gordon Green’s Halloween is far too forgettable and by-the-numbers to justify its existence.
Second-year film production student Maria Habib comments: “I still prefer the original because of its novelty, which I couldn’t say about this sequel mostly because the tropes were ones we’ve all seen before.”

With Halloween upon us and the galore of candy it brings, the holiday can be a safe haven for the sweet-toothed person. Yet all that sugary goodness is only ‘good’ in name.
Halloween is a billion-dollar holiday, second only to christmas in both shopping and sugary treat consumption. On average, a person will spend $42 on candy. In 2014, Canadians spent $397 million on candy, confectionary, and snack foods.
While Halloween spending habits may be scary in their own right, what should be even more terrifying are the health determinants that follow a night of binge-eating junk food.
Studies have shown sugar consumption is the cause of many chronic diseases, namely diabetes, and a major factor in obesity. An overconsumption of sugar can also increase an individual’s risk of heart disease, cancer, and even depression.
Whereas a healthy diet can improve a person’s mood, a diet that is high in sugar can have the opposite effect. Researchers believe that blood-sugar swings and inflammation may be responsible for sugar’s harmful impact on mental health.
An excess of sugar in a person’s diet may also accelerate the skin aging process, lead to a fatty liver, and cause acne breakouts.
The average child consumes three cups of sugar on Halloween and they don’t have upcoming finals to worry about. That is about 384 grams of sugar, way more than 25 grams—the daily recommended amount.
This isn’t to say that a person should close their doors, shut their windows and hibernate until the holiday is over; a little bit of indulgence is okay, as long as it is in moderation. No matter how tempting it may seem to eat all one’s problems away with a packet of mini Kit-Kats—don’t. The best way for an individual to watch their sugar intake is to avoid giving into their impulses. No matter how great the sales are on post-Halloween sugar, refrain from buying the whole stack and just stick to one or two packs. Stocking up on candy will only lead to a dark path; and not the good kind with witches and warlocks but the kind with type 2 diabetes—which should be a much scarier thought.
 


I was diagnosed as type 2 last year, my weight was 125kg, my doctor wanted me to start insulin and encouraged a diet with an alarming amount of carbs, so I went to boots and bought a blood sugar tester that I used every day, and started on a Atkins type diet. I.e no carbs….. and when I say no carbs I really mean none. So lots of meats and fish, eggs etc. I also got some useful information here http://mydiabetesway.com/7-steps-to-health-and-the-big-diabetes-lie-review  I gradually started loosing weight at a rate of 3kg per month and Im now 94kg, I have never taken insulin and in a few months I will be my target weight. my lifestyle can never go back to carbs, but I can have some nowerdays without my blood sugar increasing, so if I want a curry I can have a Nan bread with it but no rice chips etc. And to be honest when you cut out carbs you can eat a lot of really tasty things that help lose weight a fry up without the beans is fine, lamb chops and kebabs without the bread etc. The only downside is because of the extra fat intake I need to be doing daily cardio. I really believe doctors are offered too many incentives by drug companies and tend to love writing prescriptions instead of encouraging a positive change in our lifestyles.

It is most notably the busiest time of the semester. With midterms ending and finals quickly approaching, it seems silly to spend a day in someone else’s shoes. With Halloween also falling right in the middle of the week, it can be difficult to get out, get dressed, and frivolously enjoy the festivities.
For some students, it’s a break from their hectic lives, where they can sit down, shoot the breeze with their friends and throw a couple drinks back to forget why they even started drinking in the first place. Yet, before they lose themselves in the polyester, marijuana, and tequila, it’s good to note that halloween should not be an excuse for their livers to regret the holiday altogether.
When asked if he was partaking in any Halloween activities, an anonymous second-year business student replied, “I’m dressing up for Halloween as Tarzan and going to a club. I usually dress up and go to a social gathering or to a Halloween based event.
“I don’t consider Halloween an excuse to go out and party, I don’t like to drink heavy as I’m there to enjoy time with my friends and not become a liability to them,” he says.
Halloween can be a time for students to take a well deserved break. Some might argue it can come at the worst of times academically, but others can say that what makes it so great is that it essentially forces a person to put down their pen. One thing that’s clear is that if there’s only one day to slack off, people might take that to an extreme.
Halloween is considered one of the booziest of holidays. While kids are out in search of candy, young adults tend to look for something a lot stronger, and a little less sweet. Whatever the case, Halloween might not be for everyone, as not all share the sentiment.
An anonymous first-year political science student says: “I won’t be dressing up, I will be doing school work. I haven’t celebrated Halloween since I was a child. Mostly because it just isn’t for me. As an actor, dressing up for me isn’t special—it’s a day at work, so that might be part of the reason I don’t like celebrating it.”
Shayandeep Das, a second-year health management and health services financial student said: “I’m going to a small party and then hitting a club. I don’t use Halloween as an excuse to drink heavily because I do that when I want to. Halloween is about enjoying time with friends—enjoyment itself is supremely subjective, and everyone has their own process. I don’t see Halloween as an excuse, but rather, an occasion to enjoy.”
While drinking during holidays is a relatively common practice, binge-drinking on university and college campuses tends to exceed the average. When Halloween falls on a weekend, the work for campus security and local police becomes more difficult, as students tend to go on an alcohol-fuelled benders starting Friday night and lasting well throughout the weekend (colloquially known as Halloweekend). However, when Halloween falls on a weekday, the parties tend to be spread out, with various events lasting throughout the week.

Raz Rabin, a York University film production alumnus, is an aspiring recording artist. His music is rooted in alternative hip-hop, a genre influenced by rhythm and blues, mixed with a little bit of rock and roll.
Rabin found his passion in film production at a very young age, after watching ‘Titanic.’ Ever since, he has wanted to learn about the behind-the-camera, technical side of films. Rabin put his passion into practice by shooting a plethora of short films at home. Eventually, he decided to pursue a film production degree at York.
York has helped Rabin with both his music and production. “It gave me the opportunity to connect and network with people. Also, it built my confidence in the approach of public speaking, which translated into helping me perform live. York has great teachers who have a lot of experiences. The equipment is amazing as well: the sound system there is incredible,” he says.
Aside from a few vocal lessons, Rabin is a musical autodidact who developed his songwriting and recording skills by studying the art of others. However, he has worked out his own unique style.
Rabin’s music encourages people to fearlessly take chances regarding travel and pursuing their goals.
“Getaway,” one of Rabin’s strongest tracks, is inspired by his life-changing experience of backpacking around the world for four months. This mellow beach track is about getting away from the city, travelling and living every day to the fullest. The song’s riveting video was shot in Portugal, and features clips of Rabin exploring old castles and purchasing tourist maps.
In another video, “Nightcrawler,” Rabin represents Toronto. This short film, which Rabin created and shot, depicts Sam Kantor, a well-known actor, at the subway station. Sitting across from Kantor, is a mysterious hooded man with an antique telephone resting next to him. The stranger leaves the subway abruptly, the phone rings and after hesitation, Kantor picks up the phone and the audience is transported to Kensington Market.
Rabin’s biggest influence is Russ, a motivational rapper with a hungry work ethic who handles all aspects of his art and career. He draws other influences from New York rappers who revolutionized the game, classic rock, and early hip-hop.
Rather than forcing his music, Rabin lets the inspiration flow, eliciting a powerful dynamic energy.
What’s next for Rabin? He’s working on his new album and organizing a tour through around seven to 10 Canadian cities. He has an upcoming gig in San Francisco and plans to shoot more music videos.
Rabin’s advice for aspiring recording artists is: “You got nothing to lose by chasing your dreams. You only have one life to live and the worst thing that can happen is to wake up at 80 and tell yourself I wish I would’ve done that.”

The Lions field hockey team brought home the OUA banner for a second consecutive season, after they won all three playoff games last weekend, in Waterloo.
The OUA final match was played against the Guelph Gryphons on Sunday. The Lions edged their opponents to win 1-0, securing the championship.
Jaslan Stirling scored in the 6th minute, early in the first half, in what turned out to be the only goal of the game.
The Guelph Gryphons tried several times to tie the game, especially in the closing minutes of the second half, when they laid siege to the Lions’ goal, attempting several consecutive corners. The Lions’ defense, however, successfully thwarted their attempts, and made sure of the OUA triumph.
To get to the finals, the Lions demolished the McMaster Marauders 16-0 in their first match on Friday, and then won 8-2 in their semi-final match on Saturday against the playoff hosts, the Waterloo Warriors.
Friday’s 16-0 victory against the McMaster Marauders was both the Lions’ biggest win, and the biggest margin of victory by any team in the OUA this season. It was utter dominance for the Lions, as they scored nine goals in the first half, and seven in the second.
Jaslan Stirling opened the goal floodgates in the 10th minute, and went on to score two more goals to complete the hattrick. Stirling was, however, not the highest goal scorer on the pitch this time, as rookie Amber Sandhu scored five goals. Frankie St Louis, and Haley Bannister each added two; and Sarah Vollmerhausen, Chloe Walton, Kyra Mckinnon, and Sarah Powell accounted for the remaining four goals to complete the Lions’ scoring fest.
On Saturday, the Lions continued their assault on the net, as they secured another high-scoring victory, defeating the Waterloo Warriors 8-2 in their semi-final match.
St Louis continued where she left off on Friday, opening the scoring in the 7th minute. Walton doubled the lead three minutes later and scored two more goals in the second half to complete the hattrick. The Lions were ahead 4-1 at the end of the first half, thanks in part to two goals from Sandhu.
Walton’s second half goals were the first of that period, but were followed by another Warriors goal that cut the Lions’ lead to four. Claire Church completed the Lions’ 8-2 rout of the Warriors, scoring the final two goals in the closing minutes of the game.
The OUA victory is the Lions’ ninth title. Before their OUA victory last season, the Lions’ had not won the provincial championship since 1996.
Speaking after the game, Stirling, who scored the winning goal in the final and finished first in scoring in the OUA, said she “couldn’t be prouder,” and “it was a surreal experience to be a part of the winning team two years and counting.” In regards to the final on Sunday, she revealed that “multiple players were injured, one with a broken knuckle, but that the team “played through the pain and did not give up, showing that they were deserving of the win.”
York will get another shot at national glory next weekend, when they take on the the University of Victoria Vikes in the U SPORTS championship. The Lions will play host to the Vikes in a best of three series at Alumni Field.
Games one and two are Friday and Saturday at 2 p.m., and, if necessary, game three will be Sunday, also at 2 p.m.
