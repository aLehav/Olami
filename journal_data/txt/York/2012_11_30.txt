Toronto police are investigating after a female student reported being sexually assaulted in the basement of Stong College, in front of the art gallery on November 29.
According to a security bulletin posted on the York Security Services website and emailed to the York community Friday morning, the attack occurred between 12:30 pm and 1:00 p.m.  
The female York student was approached by a male who asked her if she wanted to dance, the security bulletin says. The male then allegedly proceeded to grab her hand and then press himself against her. The female pulled away and the suspect left the scene.
The incident was reported to York Security at 4:30 p.m. the same day.
Police describe the suspect as a white male who is approximately 20 years old, six-foot-two, and has a thin build, brown hair with a Mohawk haircut and brown eyes. He was wearing a heavy dark winter coat and blue jeans.
This incident took place while York administration, members of the Toronto Police Services and students gathered together for the president’s open forum, which was organized to discuss solutions for increasing safety at York University.
This is the third on campus sexual assault reported in November.
