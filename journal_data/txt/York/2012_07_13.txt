Toronto police released security camera video and images this afternoon of the suspect involved in the break-and-enter of a townhouse that happened early Thursday morning just off campus.


A 22-year-old woman discovered a stranger in her Village apartment bedroom on Assiniboine Road around 5 a.m. Toronto police are investigating, calling the incident a possible sex offender case.
The video shows the suspect on a balcony at night peering through a window, taking off his shirt and using it to muffle a door handle, and attempting to open a door.
Police say the man immediately fled the Assiniboine Road townhouse after the woman screamed when she discovered him on his hands and knees beside her bed. The woman reportedly fled as well.
 Toronto police describe the suspect as a black male in his late teens, standing 5’8″ with a thin build and short dreadlocks.
