Flurry of social media activity about incident, police unable to find evidence after patrolling the Village
Rumours that spread across Facebook and Twitter Monday night, regarding a man in the Village dressed in a Santa Claus suit armed with a gun, turned out to be false.
On November 27, Toronto Police searched the Village after being notified that a man dressed in a Santa Claus suit armed with a gun was in the area.
York students were tweeting and posting on Facebook, alleging that friends of friends had seen this man. The earliest tweet with the hashtag “#YorkU,” which described a man dressed as Santa in the Village, appeared at 12:10 a.m. On Facebook, the earliest post appeared at 10 p.m.
Twitter user @superkyol tweeted, “York friends in the Village: there’s a man dressed as Santa driving a tank down Sentinel. Be Safe! #YorkU.”
Constable Wendy Drummond says several officers were assigned to the case at 11:44 p.m. and left the scene at 12:48 a.m. after being unable to locate any evidence of this man. For “security reasons,” she was unable to comment on how many units were dispatched.
Elvira Garcia, a third-year psychology student, says she first heard the news upon returning to Pond residence from studying in the library at 1 a.m. Garcia says her entire Facebook wall was covered with posts about the alleged incidents.
“At first, I was laughing because it sounded really stupid and funny, but there were so many posts that even though I tried not to be scared, in the end, I was,” says Garcia.
Drummond says this was all a rumour that began last night, and there’s no truth to any of it. She says there were no reported injuries or occurrences.
Kashan Kaukab, a second-year business and economics student, says he first heard the rumour through a post on Facebook around 10 p.m. The post warned others about the armed man and suggested they to stay indoors.
Kaukab says he was not too concerned initially and quickly forgot about it, but he recognizes that he, as well as the rest of the campus, may be on edge given the latest string of reported campus crimes.
“The last week, we’ve been getting emails that people have been getting robbed, so I thought there might have been something going on,” says Kaukab.
Eumna Syed, a first-year English major, also says she didn’t believe the rumours at first because they sounded ridiculous.
“When a lot of people started posting about it, it became more real. It kind of confirms it when more people talk about it,” Syed says. “Every day, there’s some kind of news about somebody getting assaulted. When will it stop?”

Last week, students were notified through security bulletins of four out of five crimes that occurred on the York campus.
The first incident, a knifepoint robbery in the Health, Nursing, and Environmental studies building, was reported on November 19, police say.
Detective sergeant Al Coulter of 31 Division says police have spoken to a witness, and have seized forensic evidence from the crime scene. They are currently looking at video footage of the incident they received from
York security. No suspects were named.
Coulter says police removed the door handles to obtain fingerprints of the suspect.
The second incident, which occurred the following day on November 20, was a robbery at 8 p.m. between Vari Hall and the Ross Building, police say.
According to police, two male suspects approached a York student, and one of the suspects pulled out a knife and demanded the student’s wallet. The student complied, and no one was harmed in the incident.
Coulter says police have obtained descriptions of both suspects, but no arrests have been made.
The third incident, which students were not notified about via a security bulletin, was a sexual assault that occurred on November 23 around 3:15 p.m. in the TTC bus loop. As the female student was waiting for the bus, the suspect came from behind, grabbed her, and fled the scene. The victim didn’t immediately report the incident, but reported the crime on Monday, November 26. The police have obtained a suspect description.
The fourth incident, a sexual assault, occurred on November 23 at 4:45 p.m.
As a female student was walking through Vari Hall, the suspect sexually assaulted her and then immediately fled the scene, police say.
Coulter says police believe this suspect is also responsible for the sexual assault that occurred earlier that day.
The fifth incident, also on November 23, happened at 7:00 p.m. on the Ross podium near the Scott Religious Centre.
Two York students were approached by two male suspects and were asked if they had drugs, police say. When the students replied they did not have any, one of the suspects struck one of the students with a metal pipe. The suspect fled the scene, and the student was transported by EMS to the hospital.
Coulter says the police have obtained descriptions of these suspects, but no arrests have been made.
All York crime investigations remain open until solved, Coulter says.

List of demands of administration to be compiled and presented at Thursday’s open forum
Following a series of on-campus crimes last week, students took to Facebook to organize a rally aimed at improving security at York.
Over 1,250 students have confirmed they will be attending Wednesday’s ‘Protest for more safety at York’ event in Vari Hall from 12:45 p.m. to 2 p.m., hosted by the administrators of the YorkU Memes Facebook page and Students for York.
According to Students for York vice-chair Kasra Amidi-Rad, one of the event’s organizers, the rally will focus on gathering student suggestions for improving security on campus in light of the concern that recent sexual assaults and robberies have instilled in many students.
These suggestions will be presented to York administration at Thursday’s open forum, where senior administration and Toronto Police services will be present, and where the floor will be open for student input.
The organizers of the protest are finalizing their list of demands of the administration after the protest, and many students are listing suggestions on the Facebook page, according to Amidi-Rad.
The ideas include increasing the number of security guards on campus, a permanent police presence, key card access to every building after a certain time similar to buildings at Ryerson, and increasing personnel to man camera surveillance viewing stations 24 hours a day.
Navid Khan, an administrator for YorkU Memes and creator of the event page, says what inspired him to take action was a number of students on the page suggesting a student gathering.
The purpose of the rally is to bring up questions and concerns of the student body as a whole with regards to safety.
“We want everyone’s input on this, not just a select few presidents of this club and that club. We want everyone to have their say,” he says.
Khan says he was moved to organize the rally after hearing that a friend of a friend was assaulted with a metal pipe last Friday.
“Having someone you know get hit personally is different. That’s when you have to take a stand because you think, ‘This could be me next,’” he says.
Despite an overall enthusiasm for pushing for improvements to security on campus, not all students are in agreement on what the final demands presented to York administration should be.
Adham Halabi, a third-year business and finance student, says he will be attending the rally but only as an observer. On the Facebook event page, Halabi says the location of the Keele campus, and its openness to the public at large, is the bigger problem.
“Unless they build a fortress around it and maybe a moat with some alligators swimming in it, it won’t stop outsiders from getting in,” he writes.
Halabi goes on to write, “Crime happens in less than a minute, so extra security guards won’t do much because they can’t respond that fast. Maybe some surveillance could be installed so security could respond to threats and violence, but by then the damage would already have been done.”
Traian Olinescu, a fourth-year criminology student, says while open dialogue is crucial to finding solutions, he’s afraid the rally will result in a mass panic with no realistic solutions being proposed. He also disagrees with some of the ideas suggested by other students on the event page.
“There have been a couple of incidents on campus, and now you want access cards for buildings? I am sorry, but I like my university the way it is!” he writes.
York administration is aware that this rally is occurring and they have allowed the protest to take place so long as it is peaceful and does not disturb classes in the area.
“Freedom of expression is one of York University’s guiding principles,” says Joanne Rider of York media. “Members of the York community have the right to express their views, provided they do so within the law and in a peaceful and non-threatening manner.”

Toronto Police detective says he is “100 per cent sure” the school knew Monday about second sexual assault
A second sexual assault that occurred November 23 was not reported to students.
Detective sergeant Al Coulter of 31 Division told Excalibur that in addition to the sexual assault of a female walking into Vari Hall at 4:45 p.m. on November 23, which students were notified about, another sexual assault occurred the same day but wasn’t reported by the victim until Monday.
“She came out of Steacie Library, and as she was waiting for the 196B TTC bus, someone came from behind and grabbed her,” says Coulter of the sexual assault.
The victim didn’t immediately notify anyone of the incident, but went home and discussed it with her husband before finally reporting it on Monday.
Coulter says he is “absolutely, 100 per cent sure that the school knows about this incident.”
“What the lead detective does is call the university to contact York security to see if they have video of the incident,” he says.
Joanne Rider of York media says the university’s security bulletin protocol includes criteria stating “that a security bulletin will be issued when a serious incident has occurred and if there is risk of recurrence.”
“So the incident that was reported on Monday is, of course, serious in nature, but it occurred at 3:15 p.m. last Friday, and there was a reccurrence that took place at 4:45 p.m., which had already been reported,” Rider explains.
Rider further explains the sexual assault that occurred in Vari Hall was considered as the “recurrence.” Thus, according to the security bulletins protocol, the second sexual assault, which happened on the same day, but was reported Monday, November 26, is not required to be broadcasted as a bulletin to the York community.
“There had already been another occurrence, so it’s really timing. The timing dictates, with this particular occurrence, that the risk of recurrence had already unfortunately taken place,” says Rider.
This new criteria for security bulletins, implemented on October 31, 2012, indicates that an incident will not be broadcasted if a recurrence has already taken place.
The suspect in both sexual assault cases appears to be the same person, Coulter says.
As of last week, five Toronto Police officers have been patrolling the campus along with York security following four other incidents, including robberies and sexual assaults, which all occurred on campus last week.
“Certainly, York University is committed to a safe environment and to working with students, staff, and faculty across the campus, and we have articulated a protocol that facilitates effective communication when occurrences do happen and when there is a risk of recurrence,” says Rider.
