“Lingering Ghost”
I felt him lingeringI felt him staringHis presence made me shiverHe made me quiverIf he wanted to, he could be dreadful, he could be meanHis glowing silver presence was ravineBut looks aren’t everything, even though he was an eerie thingHe gave comfort in lonelinessHe gave protection at nightHis cold lips would kiss my neckHis cold hands would wrap around my backHe is my secret, for if he was knownHe would be mocked and fearedHe was a ghostMy ghost lover at mostOur love was strange, our love was quietIt made me protest life and him, riot deathFor we could never be one, as long as I had a human form, and him noneSo, he will forever be my lingering ghostThe one I love the most
“Fall Like Autumn”
When the sun steps aside, the green of the leaves begins to hideCold, crisp wind takes formThe spirit of summer begins to transformOctober becomes the death of bright daysAnd candles begin to light hallwaysAutumn is a season for all, even though she’s a season of fallTrees let go everything they harbourHow beautiful are they, for they show us the armour in letting goAutumn is a season of change, for she keeps us entertained with all the glory of her coloursFallen leaves are never dead, for they dance in the breezeThey find a new way to live, but one we often cannot seePerhaps you should fall too and become an autumnSuccumb to the wind and for a little while, become numbWhen the sun comes back in sight, you’ll take flight and glow like a new lightAutumn is a season of change, a chance to rearrangeShe is a season of stillness, and a chance given by nature to embrace frailnessFor regrowth is ensured, because after grey days, light will always make way
“A Child’s Dream”
When black cats are seen, and witches walk the streetThe moon glows brighter each time a child says “trick o’ treat”Humans take the form of goblins, warlocks, and ghostsHalloween is the day a child’s dream whirls them mostAs the night goes on, sweets weigh bags downThe light of a new day begins to come aroundJust like that, the day to pretend is overAnd it will come again next October
