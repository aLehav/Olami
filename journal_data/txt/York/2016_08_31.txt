York gives it to you straight as soon as you get here — this is your time. This is your time to waste away, or your time to have the most productive and experience-rich years of your life.
Experience is the key word. They say there was a time when you could go to college or university and come out at the other end, four years later, with the job you always wanted. That is definitely no longer the case. Nowadays, just about any list of qualifications for a job asks you for experience, not just a degree. They don’t want to know about your program. They want to know what you’ve been through and what you learned from it.
To remain competitive in this kind of market, making the best of your time in university is key. In my years at York, I have witnessed students squandering far too much time, effort and often money on meaningless experiences without gaining anything. Yet they insist on trying again and again. Casually dropping in and out of empty relationships, drinking away during exam season and leaving Toronto to go vacationing in another near-identical concrete jungle are a few examples I’ve encountered.
Of course, every new experience is a risk that you take, and as skeptical as I may be, drinking through exam season may or may not actually work for some students. So it’s not so much the risks that students take that I find disturbing, it’s the risks that they don’t take. It’s important to realize that there probably won’t be a better time in your life to try stepping out of your comfort zone than now. York is a land of opportunities for those who are willing to step up and take them.
Try a course that interests you in a field that is completely unrelated to your major. Join a varsity sports team or take part in college intramurals. Head over to York Lanes and and try food from different cultures. Take some time to explore the library and find books to read on subjects that interest you. Develop your skills such as debating and public speaking by joining different clubs. Learn about the social justice issues that student activists on campus are fighting for. Try to suggest your own essay topic to your professor instead of choosing from the list given to you.
And while you’re at it, visit Excalibur’s office in the Student Centre to learn how you can contribute to your community newspaper.
The point is to gain diverse experience. Make it a habit to try something new and think of what you can learn from it. I could sum this up by encouraging you to use your time wisely, but I won’t, because it’s difficult to foresee the wisdom in something. But do use your time. Because this is your time. It’s running out and you’ll never get it back once it’s gone.

The York Lions men’s and women’s soccer teams opened their seasons last weekend in Sault Ste. Marie against the Algoma Thunderbirds.
York won all four games with ease, crushing the Thunderbirds by a combined score of 30-0.
The men will be looking to defend their title as national champions after winning the Sam Davidson Memorial Trophy for the past two years, while the women will look to improve on last season’s semifinal loss.
The women played first on Saturday, with Nour Ghoneim opening the scoring in the 14th minute, assisted by Christina Morelli. Ghoneim then returned the favor, assisting Morelli on the second goal of the game in the 38th minute.
York’s third goal of the match came late in the first half from Ashley Nater, assisted by Catherine Guevin. The Lions would take a 3-0 lead into halftime.
The Lions came out red–hot in the second half, scoring five goals. The first two came courtesy of Kiyani Johnson, assisted by Charlene D’Mello and unassisted, respectively.
Dina Ricco scored in the 78th minute, and then less than a minute later, Guevin scored York’s seventh goal. Both were unassisted.
York’s final goal came in the 90th minute from Morelli, who netted her second of the game.
The men’s quest for a threepeat started off strong. The Lions opened the scoring in the first minute of the game with an unassisted goal by Maurizio Ragone.
York’s second goal came in the 11th minute, credited to “team.” That would be it for the first half, as York would take a 2-0 lead into the break.
The Lions came out strong in the second half, scoring five goals. The first came in the 55th minute with an unassisted goal by Ryan Telfer.
Jonathan Lao scored York’s fourth goal of the match in the 61st minute, assisted by Telfer. York’s final three goals of the match were unassisted, with Milan Beader scoring in the 78th minute and Josh Kiselyov scoring less than a minute later. The final goal, in the 88th minute, was Telfer’s second of the match.
The women played first on Sunday as well, beating Algoma 11-0 and scoring seven goals in the first half. The men didn’t light up the net as much in their second game, beating the Thunderbirds by a more typical soccer score of 4-0.
Both the men’s and women’s teams will be back in action September 3, where they will play Laurier at home starting at 1 p.m.

National Aboriginal Day in Canada should be an important day of reflection for all Canadians. One day alone cannot possibly account for the racist actions of the Canadian government towards Aboriginal people; the horrors and traumatic experiences of residential schools; or the loss of Aboriginal culture, land, lives and faiths. On June 21, York attempted to solidify its devotion to Aboriginal studies and awareness at York by unveiling a granite sculpture created by Inuit carvers Ruben Komangapik and Koomuatuk “Kuzy” Curley with a team of assistants and apprentices, including students from the Department of Visual Art and Art History and members of the neighbourhood community.
“Ahqahizu,” the sculpture commissioned by the Mobilizing Inuit Cultural Heritage, or MICH, was a $3.5 million collaborative effort between various art departments at York and was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and other organizations. The research initiative started in 2012 and employs Inuit and non-Inuit community members and artists.
The unveiling of “Ahqahizu” near the York Lions Stadium opened with traditional drumming by Iqaluit musician Mathew Nuqingaq and songs from Juno award-winning Inuk singer and songwriter Susan Aglukark.
“It’s wonderful to have the opportunity to celebrate Indigenous and Inuit culture in such a visible and powerful way on our campus,” said York President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri to York Media. “In a multicultural city such as Toronto, this sculpture will create opportunities for dialogue about Inuit art and culture — and we at York are delighted to be part of this important conversation.”
“Mobilizing Inuit Cultural Heritage celebrates the contribution of Inuit visual arts and performance to Inuit language preservation, social well-being and cultural identity,” said York Research Chair, curator and art history professor Anna Hudson to the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design. “Working with the artists over this past year on the creation of ‘Ahqahizu’ has been an exceptional realization of this celebration, and a deep intercultural learning opportunity. It has opened our campus to increased indigenization of university education.”
“We had to be very patient while carving to get the right balance when working on the motion of the bicycle kick, like floating in the air. This project is a great example for Inuit people that we can accomplish anything if we are determined,” said Curley to York Media.
Komangapik agreed, adding, “I’m very happy to promote our culture and heritage through art with the help of MICH.”

The first year of university for many students is one of many firsts — the first time living on their own, the first time being responsible for their own classroom attendance and the first time handling their own finances. Like the firsts of many things, mistakes and blunders are made. Here at Excalibur, we took a hard look at the financial boo-boos that many froshies make.
The average post-secondary student spends the largest amount of their budget on food and beverages, according to a market research done by refuel agency. This appeared to be a consensus among York students as well.
Farah Isahack, a third-year business and society student, agrees.
“In my first year I spent a lot of money on food. The food on campus is not only more expensive, but I also noticed the portions were smaller. But that didn’t stop me from buying a meal and a snack daily.”
Vendors, regardless of whether they are franchised or not, reserve the rights to change and alter prices and many York students noticed the differences in pricing on- and off-campus.
Students that were interviewed generally agreed that they wish they had packed food and made healthier decisions on campus. They also mentioned that lack of accessible and clean refrigerators and microwaves made bringing food from home difficult.
“I was at school normally for six to 10 hours [a day]. The last thing you want to do after being in class all day is to eat room temperature food that’s been sitting in your bag all day. And a lot of the microwaves on campus are dirty and grimey,” says Ilhaam Warsame, second-year political science student.
Generally, microwaves on the Keele campus are easy to come by, as most colleges and cafeterias are equipped with at least one, but refrigerators are much harder to find. This can be combatted by purchasing lunch bags with thermal insulation technology.
Another common financial mistake was spending money on books. On average, a post-secondary student spends $800 to $1,000 on textbooks for class.
The numbers seemed to follow suit with what York students felt. Sarah Ahmed, second-year psychology student, says, “although I feel like I made a lot less mistakes than the average Joe, I do regret buying my books before classes started.”
There are many alternatives to buying brand new books from the bookstore. Many textbooks are available online at a discounted price, including e-books, used copies or PDF files. You can also split the cost with a classmate and share the book, look for reserved copies in the library or explore renting options.
“I rented most of my books in my second year and I saved a crazy amount of money. I wish I had done that in my first year. I spent almost $600,” says Isahack.
Textbooks and food aside, a froshie must have a social life as well, one that likely comes with a hefty price tag. Bria Hamilton, third-year environmental studies student, says she regrets spending money on going out. “I think trying to keep up [with] an expensive social life was my biggest mistake. Living on my own for the first time meant a lot more freedom, going out, going shopping constantly and buying food at restaurants all the time. I think I had a fear of missing out. I’d tell my past self not to be concerned about that.”
This budgeting issue is not one isolated to students who live on campus. Warsame opted to commute to school, yet addresses similar issues. “I went out a lot because my friends lived on [residence] and I would sleep over and go out with them. Although I spent a lot less money than them, I could have just as easily saved all that money.”
The spending plague that seems to infect all students is electronics. “I spent about $4,000 on a laptop, phone and tablet when I started at York in 2013. By third year all I have to show for my purchases was a mildly used laptop. Both my tablet and phone gave out by second year.”
Back-to-school advertising can be difficult to avoid when the deals appear too good to miss out on, but students point out that with electronics, it’s better to wait. “A couple weeks in, I saw the Black Friday sales and I regretted making my purchases,” says Isahack. When it comes to electronic products, waiting out the frenzy and doing research beforehand about price and longevity is advised.
York is notorious for being a commuter school. There is no bigger indicator that school is in session than bus shelters filled to the brim with eager students waiting to go home and parking lots filled with students’ and faculties’ cars. York’s parking passes range from $81 to $1,536, depending on your spot and the kind of vehicle you drive.
Amarpreet Dhami, fourth-year accounting student, says, “I spent a little over $1,000 for a parking pass and the first semester I had only had class two times a week […] I could have saved so much money by just buying tokens and I didn’t even go to class half the time.”
Public transit users are also shaking their heads when they calculate their expenses. “When I ended up doing the math, I would have saved about $30 on average by just buying tokens and not the [Metropass] and I wish I would have done that instead,” says Warsame.
Overall, it seems that a lack of experience and knowledge caused these financial blunders, with many mistakes easily remedied in the following years. But knowledge and experience cannot solve all financial problems. Despite knowing about the cheaper options, Warsame was still unable to save money.
“York gave me a $500 bursary but put it on my student card rather than towards my tuition like it did in previous years. This left me no choice but to spend it at York vendors. This meant I had to buy all my books from the bookstore and [food at] food places at York. I couldn’t even use the money towards my Metropass.”
So what’s a broke-ass student to do? The answer is in the numbers. Properly counting your expenses and comparing your options is advised. The YFS offers discounted printing options and Cineplex tickets, while the Lions gym offers discounted gym prices on campus. You can also fill out a Student Financial Profile on York’s website and apply for scholarships. Budgeting is key, and mistakes are part of the learning experience you pay thousands of dollars for here at York.

Students hoping to take the subway to York might have to wait another year as the TTC responds to Toronto Mayor John Tory’s call for “efficiencies” in the city’s 2017 budget. Delaying the subway extension to York was one of several measures proposed by the TTC to meet the council’s directive to make 2.6 per cent worth of cuts to all city agencies, including Toronto Community Housing.
Stuart Green of media relations at the TTC says the agency is committed to meeting the new opening date at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, TTC CEO Andy Byford has refused to endorse the “unpalatable” cuts.
Fourth-year communications student Mayeesha Chowdhury says that cuts are understandable once budget season rolls around.
“However, I don’t think our [transportation] department can afford any more cuts. In the last few years, we’ve barely seen any tangible improvements in public [transportation],” she says.
“The York subway has been postponed for the last god knows how long, and I don’t think students should have to bear [its] weight,” she adds.
Chowdhury suggests action be taken so that students don’t become collateral damage.
“Further subsidize the Metropass so we don’t have to sacrifice an arm and a leg to get to school — if you’re not going to make it easier, might as well make it cheaper.
“I don’t think constant construction is a good environment for aspiring students. If they care about students and the younger generation as much as they like to say they do, maybe provide us with a better environment and sort out production timelines,” she says.
The problem with the cut is not limited to the 2.6 per cent figure, but also the failure to fund the cost of planned service improvements, inflationary cost increases and the start of the Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension project, according to transit expert Steve Munro.
“The delay in opening is not politically realistic, but it is one of the larger items in the new costs the TTC faces next year. Savings from service cuts elsewhere would have to be substantial to offset this,” says Munro.
Although delaying the Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension is bound to anger York students, Munro says the extension would be used by relatively few current users such that customer perceptions of the TTC should not suffer drastically despite the delay.
“Customer perceptions of the TTC will depend as much on what happens to the rest of the system, including fares and the effect of the Presto rollout,” he says.
“I know that York has been salivating over their subway for years, but the fact is that most TTC riders won’t have cause to use it. Indeed if service cuts elsewhere are needed, there could be resentment of the new subway most don’t use.”
Milan Gokhale, board chair of TTC riders, a transit advocacy organization, says the proposed funding cut is unrealistic without being accompanied by drastic cuts to service and large increases to fares, both of which he says would be devastating for the public perception of the TTC as a reliable, affordable and robust transit network.
“Simply put, the mayor is proposing the single largest cut to TTC funding in the city’s history,” he adds.
Council is expected to approve 2017 budgets for city agencies early next year.
