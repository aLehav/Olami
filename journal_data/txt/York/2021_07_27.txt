I really enjoyed this podcast. Depression is a hard topic I believe for most. For those of faith and those who aren’t.
I believe it’s simply because it isn’t a simple fix, rather something you often have to endure for a time.
Couple great takeaways,
Your co-host that mentioned it’s not so much that you get stronger, rather you realize how much strength you had already in you (para-phrasing)
And your Pastor’s comments about providing and being a safe space are invaluable.
It’s not always about having all the answers, rather it’s being a safe space that can mean so much to the endurer. 
Wonderful job on great subject matter. I feel enlightened.
Thank you, Adrian! I’m so glad you enjoyed it.❤️🙏🏾
