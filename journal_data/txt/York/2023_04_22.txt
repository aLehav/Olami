one bookthis is how you learn and gro
one step after anotherthis is how you change your path
one hand held out to anotherthis is how you change a life
one act of listeningthis is how you see past yourself
one bookone stepone handone choice
seeds buried deepthis is how you grow into a world outside yourself
but seeds must shed their shell before they growand a hand can only help after you have fought to stand.
