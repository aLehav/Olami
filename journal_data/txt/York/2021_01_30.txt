There is a reason why solitary confinement is one of the worst — if not the worst — punishment you could give a prisoner. If the mind is not strong enough to go without socializing or without embracing the warmth of the sun, then the prisoner’s mental health is bound to deteriorate.
When Ontario was faced with deciding which monster to battle, mental health or COVID-19, the province chose to fight against the latter, and told the rest of us to deal with our mental health by ourselves. 
Admittedly, when COVID-19 was publicly announced I didn’t take it seriously. By the time I heard about it from the mouth of mainstream media I had already heard from others that COVID-19 was just another flu. That was at the beginning of March 2020 and now in January 2021, there are still mandatory ‘stay at home’ orders being issued. 
Staying at home was once a way to avoid my social anxiety, but with moving everything online and the financial stress of getting furloughed from my job, there was nowhere left to escape. My anxiety claimed my room as an incubator. 
There was not much to do but to remember the good times. Nostalgia may be a liar, but it was better than embracing reality. And the reality was this: for almost a year, I didn’t see or hold my mother or brother who live in the States.
Facetime calls featured lagging voices and pixelated faces. As if the distance wasn’t enough, the Wi-Fi was also beginning to snail along. Occasionally I could see them clearly — my mother’s face had a few more lines above her brows and the shadows under her eyes had deepened slightly. 
My brother was beginning to look less like my mother and more like his father. He traded in her round face for an angular chin and cheekbone that cut into his eyes when he smiled. During our last video call, he showed off his missing tooth proudly smiling and declaring himself “a big boy” now.
“We all agreed to give up a year of our lives without reading the terms and conditions detailing when we would get it all back.”
His toothless smile made it clear to me just what these restrictions are good for. The restrictions did as much good for my mental health as a weighted life jacket does for a drowning victim. I was being pulled under, looking up to the surface at a distorted screen of my family seemingly aging without me. 
Resentment began to spread within me like the day going dark after 4 p.m. Alone in my own thoughts, I resented the few people that held us back from reopening — the celebrities, and the politicians that got to escape from reality, while everyone else followed the rules.
What about us? What about the people who sacrificed their year because they were told to? What about the essential workers who still had to work during a pandemic? It seemed to me that we all agreed to give up a year of our lives without reading the terms and conditions detailing when we would get it all back. 
Then, the survivor’s guilt began to settle in. The only thing left to do was reflect. I couldn’t run away to Hawaii or take a trip to St. Barts. 
My feet were bound and glued to the creaking floorboards of my room. I couldn’t be comforted with a hug from my mother or feel secured by a kiss from my partner. I had to survive this by myself. 
Just as the inmate plans their life when they are about to reenter society, I’m preparing myself for life after the pandemic. Though I’m not sure when life after the pandemic will occur, I’m still holding on to the idea that the time will come. After a cold and isolated year, I’m still hoping for a warm and welcoming spring.

Ashley “Ms Paige” Johnson, a Schulich BBA graduate, is a woman of many talents; not the least of which includes carrying on her family’s long-standing tradition of representing the Caribbean music scene here in Canada. Her mother, Debbie Johnson, is a six-time Juno award winner. Her grandmother, Angela Johnson, was one half of the celebrated Trinidad & Tobago duo, Ed & Angela Johnson. One might say Johnson has music running through her veins.
With 35 singles and as the recipient for both the 2013 and 2016 Caribbean Music & Entertainment Top Soca Artist award, Excalibur wanted to get Johnson’s perspective on what challenges she faces as a musician who thrives on live performances, and how she adapts to the current restrictive conditions created by the pandemic. We wanted to know what area of her art provides her with the most comfort, and which of her songs she feels best speaks to this moment in our collective experience. Here is what she had to say.
Q. How has music continued to be a part of your life, despite facing many restrictions in lockdown?
A. As someone who is genuinely passionate about mental health, I recognized the need to connect an audience through music, as lockdown and quarantine sparked a global feeling of loneliness. On a whim, I sat down at my piano on March 19th and kicked off daily Karaoke a la Paige videos shared through my Instagram platform at @MsPaigeMusic. The daily musical sing-a-longs spanned 24 weeks, only taking a break on Blackout Tuesday in solidarity for global awareness of the Black Lives Matter movement. Unfortunately, the personal toll of the pandemic — amplified by the exhaustion of continuing to witness Black people who look just like myself and my family continuing to be marginalized, brutalized, and killed — became too much and I paused Karaoke a la Paige for an indefinite period of time, returning for a short stint during the holiday season as a countdown to Christmas.
Q.What are some of the ways that you feel music as a practice may benefit your mental wellbeing?
A. In addition to the daily Karaoke a la Paige endeavour, I turned to music as a creative outlet throughout the pandemic, self-producing 12 Acapella tribute videos celebrating the musical contributions of artists who have been most impactful on my own musical journey. It began as a birthday tribute for Janet Jackson on May 16 and evolved into a weekly celebration highlighting phenomenal women such as Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton, and Aaliyah to name a few. Each tribute was vocally arranged, recorded, and put to video by myself in my home set-up and shared on a weekly basis over a 12-week period throughout the late spring to early summer of 2020. Although the weekly videos came to an end in the early summer months, I also shared a short Acapella tribute rendition of Michael Jackson’s They Don’t Care About Us to celebrate the King of Pop’s birthday in August — SHAMON! These can also be found on my social media platforms on both Instagram and YouTube at @MsPaigeMusic.
Q. Have you felt more, or less creative throughout the pandemic/lockdown?
A. Truth be told, I’ve been fairy musically silent for two and a half years as my last single was released in the summer of 2018. While my writer’s block definitely continued throughout the pandemic, this unprecedented time of uncertainty also provided an opportunity to connect a global audience through music via social media and enabled me to make my own contribution, no matter how small, to helping people feel connected even while apart.
