The narrative of a former East-Yorker trying to capture their young adult life in Toronto as seen on a rainy morning.

When I immigrated to Canada at eight years old from Dhaka, Bangladesh, everything felt foreign. I left behind all my friends, family, everything I’d ever known, and the only place I’d ever call “home” back in New Eskaton Road for better education and opportunities in Toronto.
My family and I settled at the 390 Dawes Road apartment complex in East York back in 2008 —  until 2021. We decided to officially close the 390 chapter and flip the page onto the next chapter of our lives. 
As I moved into my new “home” this past April, I couldn’t help but reminisce about 390 since it was my home for the past 13 years. That same home saw me experience my young adult life — from elementary school, middle school, high school, and finally university. It witnessed me flustered on my prom day back in 2017. It saw me spend hours upon hours cramming for exams at the Dawes Road Library. It even witnessed me leaving behind business school to pursue my theatre degree and all the hardships that came with it. 
390 was there during my darkest days and it was there to watch me conquer new heights.
So, on a rainy Tuesday morning, I decided to go for a long walk and visit all those spots that I called “home” for the past 13 years. I discovered that “home” is more than just a place, it’s also a feeling.
