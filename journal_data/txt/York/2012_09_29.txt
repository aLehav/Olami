A $15,000 customized, motorized wheelchair belonging to a disabled man has been recovered.
Raymond Dell’Aera’s chair was stolen in the Village, a housing complex near York’s Keele campus, last week. It was found by a woman on Thursday, September 27, close to where it had been taken. It was abandoned, and is no longer operational.
Dell’Aera says he received a voicemail message from a woman saying she found the wheelchair, and was keeping it in her garage.
He forwarded the information directly to the police who accompanied him to the woman’s house and retrieved the chair.
The battery is disconnected and the headrest is missing, but Dell’Aera says he’s confident his wheelchair can be repaired.
Police fingerprinted the chair, but were unable to find any clear matches, Dell’Aera says.
In the meantime, Dell’Aera is borrowing another power chair from his wheelchair provider.
While the chair is currently unusable, Dell’Aera says he can breathe easy.
“I’m happy I got it back, that’s it’s in my possession,” he says. “I can put some closure on the whole situation.”
Social media is still abuzz over the situation.
“Now people are spreading the word that it’s been recovered,” he says. “On Facebook, people are posting that they’re happy I got it back.”
In an email to Excalibur, Dell’Aera wrote, “I’d like to thank the media for helping create awareness of what happened. I’m certain the exposure was instrumental in the return of my wheelchair.
“Moreover, I am grateful to everyone who reached out to offer me support of all kinds.”
