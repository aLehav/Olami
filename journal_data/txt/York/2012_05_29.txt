Blueberry Hill closed its York Lanes doors on April 30, but the restaurant is not gone for good.
On May 1, Blueberry Hill owners Alex and George Kapassouris took over 2777 Steeles Avenue West, previously occupied by Eggsmart, and will be re-opening the diner at this location by mid-June.
“There are only so many places to eat on campus, and there are not too many places open on the weekends or holidays,” says George Kapassouris, co-owner of Blueberry Hill. “I’d like students to know that we’re available and that we’re within walking distance of York’s campus.”
Kapassouris says upon reopening, Blueberry Hill will be making use of a new technology called MeScan that will allow customers to select and pay for their orders using a smartphone app or online using a computer.
“You could have students ordering Blueberry Hill burgers in residence, and have the food delivered right to them,” he says.
The restaurant’s menu items will remain the same as they were at the York Lanes location, but Blueberry Hill will not be serving alcohol for now.
“We’ll still have the nice, big, cheap breakfast, burgers, salads, and all that stuff, but the main thing is there will be no beer to start with,” Kapassouris says. “We’ll see what happens as we move forward.”
