Doug McGuff’s new high-intensity strength training regimen will have you working at peak efficiency, and hitting every muscle group

Many people in in the pursuit of health and fitness spend countless hours in the gym trying to hit that one muscle group, and don’t see any discernible result. But this doesn’t have to be the case, says Doug McGuff, the author of Body by Science.
McGuff has redeveloped a revolutionary approach to strength-training that involves high-intensity strength training, which takes a minimum approach that introduces the biggest gain and gets you closer to your evolutionary point.
He has introduced a system of strength training that will have most people reaching their maximum potential in a short period of time using relatively short workout periods. Most common strength-training approaches involve going to the gym daily and working out every different muscle.
McGuff advocates five different compound body exercises that will target and hit every muscle in the body. When this type of exercise is done effectively, it will cause the body to react positively to the change and force muscle growth. Essentially he proposes a one set to absolute failure workout method, whereas you start off with a weight that is 70 per cent of your max and you precede at a very slow pace (10 up, 10 down) until you no longer feel like you can lift the weight. This way of working out will recruit the use of most your muscle fibres within the body, thus initiating bigger gains.
The five basic exercises are as follows and should be done in the order listed: seated rows, chest press, pulldown, overhead press, and the leg press. Although an advocate for exercise machines, McGuff also recommends free weights if machines are unavailable: bent-over barbell row, standing overhead press, dead lift, bench press, and squat. All these exercises are known to hit both the major and minor muscles in the body when effectively done. The one downfall with using free weights is that when going to absolute failure, it can be dangerous to do so as the weight would fall on you and they shouldn’t be done without a spotter or proper machinery.
“The two biggest mistakes people make when working out is: doing way too much exercise, and doing it too often, and not enough effort. Because they aren’t training as hard as they possibly could,” says Drew Baye, a leading authority on exercise physiology. “If they were training accordingly, they would have to cut their volume size by more than half. The workouts should be brutally hard; if someone was standing with a gun to your head you shouldn’t be able to do another rep.”

Authorities have narrowed manhunt perimeter to Scott Library

In Scott Library, the search continues for the missing student. – Mark Grant


This December will mark the three-year anniversary of a York student’s disappearance in Scott Library. York security and Toronto Police Services have been following new leads on the case, but have called the search “overwhelming.”
The still-unnamed student (reports on his identity vary) was last seen wearing a red-and-white striped shirt, blue jeans, thick-rimmed glasses, and a red-and-white hat. The student is a white male in his early-to-mid-20s, and was known to use a cane or walking stick as a result of a childhood injury.
The ongoing search had many leads in the past, but all have become dead-ends. “I thought I saw him once, but his hair was the wrong colour,” says Serena Balthazar, a fourth-year psychology student who spends most of her days searching for ways out of Scott Library.
The biggest challenge facing officers and security guards conducting the search is the threat of visual overload.
“I can’t look [at Scott Library] for more than maybe five [to] 10 minutes at a time,” said a security guard who wished to remain anonymous. “The colours aren’t complementary, the original architecture clashes with the post-modern renovations they made last year, and it’s always full of aimless, wandering students.
“None of us can search here without getting a headache, or worse. One of my co-workers is starting to hallucinate; she swears that she saw a wizard walking around in here. Beard, robe, and everything.”
With the case going on for so long, sightings have become a favourite pastime among York students. Each semester, there are multiple sightings of the student roaming through the library, but he never seems to be where witnesses remembered him being.
An oversight committee has warned the York administration that if drastic changes to the library are not made soon, more students will go missing in the “cruel, featureless void” of the Scott Library stacks.
A renovation crew was sent into the stacks shortly after the initial disappearance. If you listen closely, you can still hear them—calling for help.
In the meantime, authorities are pressing the student populace for more details on the missing student; even a first name would do.
“He was absolutely named Albert, or Wally,” says international student Rowan Hunt, from the UK. “A good chap, that one.”
However, second-year Glendon French studies major Francoise Gillespie disagrees: “His name was Charlie, and he brought his little dog everywhere he went.”
