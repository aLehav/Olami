On April 17, 2013 at approximately 4:30 a.m, a woman was sexually assaulted near Vari Hall, according to Toronto Police.
The victim was approached by a man on a bicycle, who tried to engage her in conversation. When she refused, the suspect sexually assaulted her, fleeing the scene on his bicycle.
The suspect is described as black, between five foot six and five foot seven, with a skinny build, and thin face. He was wearing a black toque, dark jacket, khaki pants, and black shoes.
The incident was the only one reported sexual assault on campus for the month of April, as confirmed by Robert Kilfoyle, director of York Security Services.
The police are still searching for the suspect involved.
Detective Sergeant Al Coulter of 31 Division says more information will be provided once the investigation is over.
