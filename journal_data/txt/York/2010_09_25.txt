York University’s report on the student union’s yearly elections process, released Sept. 16, critiques the system’s lack of transparency and fractured structural autonomy, which allegedly favours the incumbent party.
The report, conducted by York ombudsperson John McCamus, notes that the York Federation of Students (YFS) elections lacks “due process” in the appeals process, especially with the perceived conflict of interests inspired by the Chief Returning Officer (CRO) being on the same election committee responsible for reviewing the CRO’s decisions.
The YFS elections audit, which was conducted by third-party law firm Davis LLP and released Aug. 24, also recommended “the Elections Procedure Code should be reviewed in its entirety to ensure that it provides sufficient details to avoid or limit CRO discretionary decision-making relating to key elements in the Elections Process.”
The audit reports from both the YFS and York discuss the CRO selection process, and the administration’s report notes “the YFS Board that appoints the CRO is primarily comprised of the incumbent group, many of whom may seek re-election.” McCamus goes on to point out the process leads to what may be a conflict of interest.
York was led to draft their report following the dispute over last year’s CRO Casey Chu Cheong’s distribution of 10 demerit points to the New York slate for handing out copies of Excalibur. Director candidates were disqualified after accumulating 25 points, which put them over the allowance of 20 points by five.
After this ruling, complaints were made to the university about the appointment of Chu Cheong as CRO, alleging that she was selected without a clearly established hiring process.
Jeremy Salter, executive director of the YFS, told Excalibur on March 10, 2010 that the reason Chu Cheong was selected because she was “the most qualified candidate for the position.”
McCamus recommended the YFS instead create a “search committee” for the CRO. The YFS’s own audit recommended the union “publish the methodology and criteria by which the CRO is hired” to avoid future allegations about the conflict of interest.
McCamus also had concerns about the election committee as a whole. In the report he said the committee should “be reconstituted as an independent body dissociated from the current YFS directors and staff,” noting the YFS executive director, who sits as the chair on the elections committee, and other committee members also share a conflict of interest because of their association with the incumbent party.
“It appears as though there is a direct conflict of interest in having the [YFS] executive director serving as the chair of the electoral process that is responsible for selecting, in effect, his or her employer.” McCamus recommended that non-York Federation of Students members should hold a majority on the YFS Election Committee and that the university’s provost appoint a non-voting administration, faculty or student member to create a perception of independence and impartiality.
Salter said the YFS board of directors will review all of the recommendations proposed by both of the audits. He added that since the YFS is an autonomous organization, he finds it a “bit odd, to have outside individuals [university administration] making decisions regarding the election, but it is up to the will of the membership to make this call.”
Krisna Saravanamuttu, YFS president, told Excalibur on March 24, 2010 that York president Mamdouh Shoukri’s request for the York ombudsperson to complete the elections overview raised “some serious questions about student union autonomy.”
He also said that the administration should “never try to interfere with the autonomy of student unions.”
Rob Tiffin, York’s vice-president students, referenced Presidential Regulation 4 when explaining why president Shoukri commissioned York’s ombudsperson to audit the YFS elections process.
Regulation 4 states “the president of York University has a residual responsibility to ensure that York student elections are conducted in a democratic, orderly and responsible manner.”
Salter, however, said that he does not think the elections investigation is taking away from the student union’s autonomy because it is going to be up to the YFS board of directors to make any changes.
He added that the YFS is committed to making changes to its election code.
Among other recommendations put forward by the ombudsperson report was the suggestion to use metallic tape, as opposed to duct tape, when using the paper ballot process.
Both reports noted that non-York students should not be allowed to campaign, referring to the members of the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) that often advocated on behalf of the incumbent party.
Tiffin said that he is waiting to hear from the YFS about “how [the student union] plans to implement the recommendations they have received.”
“[York] is quite concerned about trying to ensure that student organizations have the ability to manage their affairs, but it goes back to […] trying to ensure there is orderly and democratic change,” Tiffin added.
Fraser Stevens, who ran for a presidential position on behalf of the New York slate against Saravanamuttu and lost in March 2010, told Excalibur in an email that he would like to believe “that the current YFS [team] will be honest enough to consider the recommendations and to enforce the changes that will aid in the running of […] fair elections.”

Students across Ontario are banding together in protest after learning that the province tops the
nationwide ranking for the highest tuition fees.
According to Sandy Hudson, chair of the Canadian Federation of Students Ontario (CFS-O), students in Ontario have to pay over $6,000 annually.
“It is simply unfair because students who reside in another provinces [may] be paying $2,500,”
said Hudson.
Keith Marnoch, York’s associate director of media relations, noted the university does not “dream up [the tuition fees]” and wanted to remind students fees are set according to a provincial government
framework.
York is working with the provincial government to secure “more sustainable funding,” he added.
Hudson noted that the CFS-O launched the “Education is a Right” campaign in September 2010 to combat provincial inequality in tuition fees.
“What we’re calling for is a post-secondary education act that would ensure equality across the board when it comes to post-secondary education policies,” she said.
Hudson also explained how the post-secondary tuition hike affects marginalized groups as well as visible minorities, people with disabilities, women and
aboriginal students.
“Because of the […] economic and financial realities of these groups in our society, and the systemic discrimination that these groups deal with, they have a lower chance of accessing post-secondary education because of the cost,” she said.
Jade Macri, a first-year human rights and equity studies student, works two part-time jobs in order to cover her tuition fees, despite the fact that she was awarded an entrance scholarship.
“If I stop working, I wouldn’t be able to cover the tuition fees,” said Macri.
However, not all students oppose the increase in tuition fees.
Amit Praharaj, a first-year environmental studies major, said he felt that the rise in tuition fees in Ontario is justified.
“In different provinces, it’s a different case,” he said. “They’ve got more funding and less things to worry about in terms of infrastructure in their provinces.”
However, students should be compensated for the time and money invested into post-secondary education, he said.
“If the Ontario government can’t find a way to get some kind of funding for the education system, maybe they have to find a way to give [the money] back,” he suggested. “Maybe drop the taxes for students graduating and trying to pay OSAP” said Praharaj.
Darshika Selvasivam, vice-president of campaigns and advocacy of the York Federation of Students (YFS), said that the YFS plans to lobby members of parliament at the provincial and federal levels during the Canadian Federation of Students’ upcoming lobby week.
By doing that, said Selvasivam, the YFS would be able to communicate how the students are feeling and illustrate the effects rising tuition fee costs have on students.
 


When the NDP were in government, they eliminated needs-based grants and increased tuition fees by 50%.
When the PC Party was in government, they cut over $430 million in just the first two years. Tuition increased by 71% by 2001, and cut student assistance by 50%.
In total, more than $630 million in funding was cut from 1990-2001, and government grants were cut by over 40% in the same time period.
After more than a decade of cuts, Is it any surprise that Ontario students pay the most in tuition?

The Economist released its ninth annual list of top business schools in the world Sept. 16, and ranked York’s Schulich School of Business 10th best.
The magazine used student and alumni input to grade master of business administration (MBA) programs on their ability to open new career opportunities; foster personal development and academic experience; increase their salary; and provide potential networking opportunities. The Economist noted these criteria were “the things that [students] themselves cite as most important.”
Dezsö Horváth, dean of the Schulich School of Business, says he is “very happy” with the ranking.
“Proud is an understatement. I am very, very pleased with my faculty and students,” he said. “This did not come overnight. This has been many, many years of very diligent, well thought out strategic plan for the school.”
Horváth noted that in the past five years, Schulich’s position in the ranking has progressively improved. He added that this is largely due to the school’s ability to innovate and adapt to new expectations in the world of business.
“We have been very innovative with new programs,” he said. “The corporate landscape has changed in terms of skill set requirements and in terms of knowledge. One of our strategic focuses is to constantly adjust our curriculum to meet these new expectations.”
Vanessa Hunt, vice-president of campus life for the York Federation of Students, said she hopes that next year Schulich can move further up in the rankings.
“Schulich students work very hard and it’s an excellent school,” she added.
At the top of the same list is the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, followed by Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business and the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.

After it was put on probation last year due to dwindling student interest, the Canadian studies program at York is back with new initiatives and a guest speaker series.
“We were put on a one-year probation when Atkinson merged into [the faculty of] liberal arts & professional studies [with the faculty of arts],” said Jon Sufrin, coordinator of the Canadian studies program. “We were given a chance to show that we ought to continue to be a program.”
The program was originally put on probation due to a declining number of majors and the intense competition it saw from other
history programs.
Colin Coates, associate professor of Canadian studies at Glendon College, said students are moving away from the program not because they don’t want to learn about Canada, but because they don’t see it as a practical major.
“Students normally want to take the interdisciplinary classes, and they tend to fill up,” said Coates. “But they don’t necessarily want to major in the discipline. Students think they can’t use it as a practical teachable subject […] in fact, teachers end up teaching things that are very similar to Canadian studies.”
A new Canadian studies speaker series, which features a number of faculty members at York, is one of many efforts the university is making to promote the program. Other measures include organizing a student club and coordinating students- versus-faculty hockey matches.
“York has always been a leader in Canada-related subjects,” said English professor Priscila Uppal. “It’s a shame that it hasn’t been promoted to students.”
Uppal cited a lack of funding as one of the major obstacles.
“We’re not generating enough [funds] to promote the program,” she said. “Universities are canceling [the Canadian studies programs] since they are smaller programs compared to others.”
Coates noted that, although there had been a number of universities in recent years that have cancelled the program, there are other institutions where the program is either being launched or is continued.
Yumna Siddiqi, a third-year human resources major, admits that she has been unable to take a Canadian Studies course but feels that it should be a viable option.
“Even if Canadian identity is based on multiculturalism, that’s an identity in itself,” she said. “No other country has such a diverse community. It’s unique and should be taught.”
“Maybe if they made [Canadian Studies courses] part of the general education courses, more people would take it,” she suggested.
“If there are not a lot of students in the program […] obviously it takes money to keep a program,” said Mariam Mahdi, a third-year social work major, who says she learned about Canada through her general education humanities course.
“I’ve been [in Canada] for three years, and I’ve learned so much from required courses and personal experience,” she noted.
Sufrin hopes that if York promotes the program to prospective students, interest in Canadian studies will eventually rise and improve.
“As soon as you actually start studying our home in our own contexts of looking at the things that make us who we are, there are plenty of distinctive things and patterns that make us Canadian,” Sufrin pointed out. “It’s a good way to counteract this idea that Canadians have no identity.”

ST. JOHN’S (CUP) — “If I am from this province, it does not make any sense if I am taking first-year English and I am paying $255 for the course and then somebody sitting along side of me, but [who] happens to be from Zimbabwe, is paying $800 for the same course,” said Daniel Smith.
Smith, chairperson for the Canadian Federation of Students-Newfoundland and Labrador, said the newest campaign that his organization is working on involves calling for a reduction in tuition fees for both domestic and international students.
“[In] the campaign we have coming up – Fund the Future – we are calling for a reduction in tuition fees […] for all students,” said Smith. “We don’t see it as a domestic or an international issue. We need to have a parity system.”
International tuition fees across the country are comparably higher to what a domestic student pays for post-secondary education.
According to Statistics Canada, for the 2010-2011 academic year, undergraduate students can expect to pay $16,768 per year for their education. That’s more than three times as much as what Canadians students can expect to pay: $5,138.
“Our brothers and sisters across the country are facing yearly tuition fee increases by five and ten percent,” said Smith. “You could start doing your degree and then in the last year, be paying fifteen or twenty percent more than you were paying when you started out. How do you budget for that?”
Smith said there is a myth out there, that insinuates that because international students do not pay taxes it means they have to pay more for tuition, but Smith said he doesn’t buy it.
“For every international student here on campus, where they work they pay taxes, where they buy groceries they pay taxes. They pay into the tax system.”
Sahib Khorana, Memorial University students’ union international students representative, said once international currencies are converted to Canadian dollars, the cost of students’ education is often more than their parents’ yearly salary.
Khorana said they are still subject to the same expensive books and apartment rental costs that their domestic counterparts pay and said she doesn’t understand what accounts for the difference in tuition fees.
“On the one hand, Newfoundland and Labrador is promoting recruitment of international students, but on the other, they are still being charged three times the fees,” said Khorana in an email.
“As international students, we have additional living and travel expenses which are usually not required for Canadian students, putting the international student at an even further disadvantage.”
“Not only is it time that the international student fees be changed and brought more in par with Canadian student fees but also […] that additional financial support be provided,” she said.
“The hypocrisy is intolerable and I for one do not support it.”

Students will be able to get their TTC student photo IDs, which can be used to purchase the $99 TTC post-secondary student Metropass, at Keele campus starting Sept. 22.
Datacard, the company contracted by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) to issue the photo IDs, will offer their services to students on Sept. 22, 23, 28 and 29 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Founders Assembly Hall.
York’s Parking and Transportation Services will no longer be selling TTC Metropasses to students on campus. They are available for purchase at any TTC ticket stand.
Students must use York’s access code, available on the transportation services website, to register online at the Datacard website before picking up the TTC student photo ID.
The TTC Metropass’ discounted student price was set following a successful collective campaign by several student unions across the GTA, including the York Federation of Students and the Glendon College Student Union.
