Man arrested is a York student
A man has been arrested in connection with a sexual assault that took place in Stong College last Thursday, Toronto Police say.

A female York student was approached by a male who asked her if she wanted to dance, the security bulletin says. The male then allegedly grabbed her hand and pressed himself against her. The female pulled away and the suspect fled the scene, says the bulletin.
