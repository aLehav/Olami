Police still searching for suspect, no access as of yet to video surveillance footage in the area
Toronto police are investigating an armed robbery that took place on the morning of Monday, November 19 in the Health, Nursing and Environmental Studies building lobby. The robbery was reported to Toronto police at 10:20 a.m.
According to a security bulletin released by York Security Services, an unknown male suspect approached a male student in the HNES lobby, produced a knife, and demanded the victim’s watch.
The 20-year-old victim turned his watch over and was left unharmed, police say.
The suspect was last spotted fleeing east on Scholars Walk, the bulletin says.
While the investigation is still pending and the suspect has not yet been identified, police say the scene was combed for any forensic evidence that might link to the suspect and/or potential witnesses. The case has been assigned to an investigator.
Joanne Rider of York media explains that in the HNES building, each floor has a security video camera by the elevator that overlooks the lobby of that floor. Each of these cameras is accompanied by a safety phone, and there are other emergency telephones placed throughout the building.
“In terms of security patrols, they had already been increased in this area of campus, so they will continue,” says Rider.
Constable Tonyo Vella of Toronto Police Services says he is unsure of whether there is video surveillance footage of the area available that might help identify the suspect.
“That is something that will be searched for. Whether [York] has something in their possession, I don’t know,” says Vella.
The suspect is described as a black male, 19-21 years of age, 5’ 7” to 5’ 8” in height, and weighing approximately 180 lbs. He was seen wearing a black hat, blue jeans, and a black tracksuit jacket with white stripes down the arms.
