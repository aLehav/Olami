 York University Community Newspaper 
Where in the world is Pro Tem?
Samantha Osaduke

Glendon’s “revitalized” campus newspaper was supposed to have hit stands November 21, but only left many scratching heads.
Anticipation had been building up for the brand new issue of Pro Tem, with several contributors on board to write for the newly budding paper.
So what went awry?
According to Aaron Doupe, manager of student affairs, “The reason for the delay was that the editorial team didn’t feel it was giving enough time for promotion after being on hiatus, so they pushed it back a week and the result is we have a full issue.”
Doupe mentions that some articles have even had to be pushed to the January issue due to lack of space.
The paper will be available at Keele campus in the main paper station in York Lanes as well as around Glendon campus, says Doupe.
“The layout is done,” says Doupe. “Final PDF edits [will be] completed this week, and then it is off to the printers for distribution next week.”
