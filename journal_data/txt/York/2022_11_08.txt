This photo essay aims to capture the sense of beauty and awe found in simple things. Oftentimes, we forget to stop and observe mundane objects such as a tree, a leaf, or a branch. Yet, by paying close attention, one might find the artistry in such things. All it requires is one’s attention. Stop, look around, observe, and try to see the complexities of life unfolding all around you. William Blake said it best;
“To see a World in a Grain of SandAnd a Heaven in a Wild FlowerHold Infinity in the palm of your handAnd Eternity in an hour.”
William Blake, “Auguries of Innocence.”
