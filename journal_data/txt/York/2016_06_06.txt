The Mandi Gray sexual assault trial resumed May 3, with the accused Mustafa Ururyar appearing on stand. Ururyar confirmed he and Gray were casually dating each other for two weeks.
During cross-examination, more personal details came to light about the nature of Ururyar and Gray’s relationships. It came to light that on the night of the alleged assault, Gray and Ururyar were at a bar with colleagues when Ururyar heard from someone that Gray was planning a threesome with him and a mutual friend, to which he was indifferent, yet expressed his disappointment to Gray when the third person did not join them at his apartment for drinks.
Ururyar maintained that it was consensual sex, as he had received a text from her earlier that evening to “come drink and then we can have hot sex.”
While walking from the bar to his apartment, Gray expressed interest in having sex, to which Ururyar responded saying he was not physically feeling up to it and did not promise her one hundred per cent. He said he would try to perform.
Gray claims Ururyar criticized her at his apartment, calling her “needy” and an “embarrassment.” Ururyar denied this in his testimony, though he did clarify by saying he did not appreciate her behaviour that night.
Ururyar apparently broke up with her while they were having sex as Gray leaned in to kiss him.
The accused reasoned he decided to break up because they were incompatible due to Gray’s behaviour at the bar when she allegedly groped him without his consent, and because he was in an open, long-distance relationship with his girlfriend who was moving to Toronto in April.
“I said we could still be friends but she would often get upset if I mentioned my girlfriend and I intended to continue my relationship with my girlfriend,” says Ururyar.
Upon hearing about the break up, Gray cried and Ururyar claims he consoled her and then they had consensual sex. During intercouse, Ururyar failed to have an erection and suggested that they watch pornography to get in the mood.
“I just put on porn because I needed extra help. It didn’t work so I suggested we just watch a movie or The Daily Show. Mandi got angry with my inability to perform and left abruptly without saying a word.”
Later he received a text from her stating “last night was fucked up.”
“I did not want to assume anything so I simply replied ‘OK’ because I did not want to dominate the conversation.I wanted to provide her space to tell me what was going on. I wanted to give her the space and opportunity to continue what she was thinking,” says Ururyar.
Ururyar’s girlfriend, Alison Moore, says he’s the best boyfriend ever, having met him seven years ago.
Moore said she was shocked when Ururyar informed her that Gray had pressed sexual assault charges against him.
“While we were in different cities, we agreed to see other people, but maintain our relationship,” says Moore.
“We agreed not to talk about our other relationships with each other.”
Closing arguments in the trial are scheduled for May 24.

York’s men’s soccer team will look to defend their title as national champions when the season kicks off at the end of August.
Last year, the Lions’ men’s team won back-to-back titles for the first time in history. The win marked the fourth time the Lions have won the Sam Davidson Memorial Trophy since 2008.
Despite the recent success, the team has been working harder this offseason according to head coach Carmine Isacco. 
“Our approach has been somewhat different. I feel like we’re working harder because we’re going to lose a few key players, and we’re not sure about a couple other ones. So it’s going to be a rebuilding process,” says Isacco.
The Lions will are saying goodbye to midfielder Matt Stinson, goalkeeper Colm Vance, striker Michael Cox and forward Jarek Whiteman. Ben Futorianski is expected to be gone, as is Joey Cicchillo, who injured his ACL during winter training.
Isacco is excited to see who steps up and fills the void. 
“We’ve got some players coming in. It’s going to be up to them how they make an impact. They’re going to be good players, but we keep a big roster, and our players who haven’t stepped up and gotten a lot of time in the past are going to have to step up and give us some more minutes.
“Jonathan Lao has always been a stalwart for us; Matthew Arnone who went from a striker to a center back position and was fantastic for us and should have a big impact. We’ll be looking to Malcolm Loukides for a lot more leadership, as well as a couple red-shirts from last year such as Adam LoFranco to step in and do well.
“We’re hoping Cristian Cavallini, who didn’t play last year because he wanted to focus on school, will come back, because he’s quite a talent and he can score goals. We’re going to look to the guys we have to be more responsible.”
When asked about the chance of a three-peat, Isacco says, “We’re not even concentrating on that. We’re concentrating on what we need to do to get better. We’re just trying to be physically, mentally and of course academically prepared for the season. It’s a new game, it’s a new season and it’s 0-0 across the board.”
The Lions open their regular season in the last week of August, with the official date still to be determined.

Elisa Alloul, third-year psychology and public administration student, has won the Board of Governors, or BoG, election with 800 votes out of a total of 1,947 cast.
Her two-year term as the representative for undergraduate students on York’s top decision making body starts July 1.
The election results were ratified by the Student Senator Caucus, or SSC, on April 1 and Alloul’s appointment as the Student Nominee to the Board of Governors was approved by BoG at its May 3 meeting, according to Sayjon Ariyarathnam the chief returning officer overseeing the election.
The election was seen in some quarters as a turf war between pro- and anti-divestment factions in York student politics.
Alloul says it is inaccurate and unproductive to portray the election as being primarily about the issue of divestment.
“Having interacted with many students during the election, the subject did not come up,” she adds.
“I am someone who is very devoted to a better future for both Israelis and Palestinians,” says Alloul.
“This is why I oppose any political agenda that contributes to the mistrust and conflict between the two sides.”
“I am also a student who believes in academic freedom and fostering mutual respect between diverse communities on campus. I see efforts to boycott and isolate Israelis collectively as destructive and contrary to these values.”
Election results were communicated to BoG through the office of the University Secretary and General Counsel, according to Maureen Armstrong, university secretariat.
Tashwiq Khan came second with 496 votes, Sebastien Lalonde had 286 votes, SAIA-endorsed Haman Mamdouhi managed 193 votes and Mohammed Barry placed last with 172 votes.
Some 55,650 York students were eligible to vote in this election, amounting to a turnout of 3.5 per cent.
The election was marred with irregularities and allegations of bribery, following Maharshi Jani’s withdrawal from the race.
Moreover, a videotape of an alleged bribery incident between candidates was confirmed by Janice Walls of York media.

Art teacher and York alumna Marisa Suriano is a painter who juxtaposes realism with abstraction within her work. She is currently working on a series of paintings where she manipulates acrylic paint to create unique abstract pieces. 
Suriano has been influenced by the cubist art style in the past, and more recently, has been interested in the postmodernist movement. She describes her art style as a mixture of realism and abstraction, through an elevated yet childish process of painting. 
“Anything can be art but not everyone can be an artist,” says Suriano. “Art nurtures the mind and the soul. It allows you to express yourself visually when you cannot verbally. It is an outlet that encourages creative thinking and abstract ideas. Art brings things to life on a daily basis so as an art teacher, it is my mission to instill a love for art in all of my students.” 
Suriano attributes her high school years as a key developing stage for her as an artist. She decided to pursue art and teaching thanks to her high school art teacher, in hopes of inspiring future generations of artists. “As for teaching,” says Suriano, “I knew I loved sharing my artwork and my art knowledge with others so it was just fitting that I become a teacher.”
Even though she enjoys teaching, Suriano holds that she is a painter before a teacher. She plans to continue creating artwork on a weekly basis in order for her to properly teach students. She dreams of opening her own art studio and private art school one day in order to focus solely on developing students’ artistic creations. 
“I want to inspire my students to embrace their many talents and understand how amazing art truly is.”
Suriano’s art has varied over the years, depending on her courses and the themes she was exposed to. Her recent artwork focuses on nature in its simplest forms. She has combined nature with her new art technique, which Suriano claims allows her to “explore art in ways I have never been able to.”

With musical talent flowing through her blood, Natasha Stephens grew up surrounded by 90s R&B and pop music, courtesy of her father who was a DJ. Stephens, a 20-year-old Seneca@York student who grew up in Toronto, is a true musical force to be reckoned with.
“My dad would say it was when I was 2, I sang the entirety of ‘I Can Believe I Can Fly,’ and at that point he knew I was going to be a musician.” 
Stephens is not only a talented vocal artist and DJ, but also a well-rounded musician. She plays a wide array of instruments including the piano, drums, guitar and steel pan, some of which were self-taught. 
For Stephens, music is a release and a way to connect with her listeners, showing them that she understands their struggles, especially concerning heartbreak. 
“Life events and experiences play a major part in my music,” notes Stephens. “I’ve always treated my song-writing as an emotional release – a therapeutic way for me to analyze my own thoughts and also connect to my listeners.” 
Stephens recognizes Brian McKnight and Aaliyah as important influences in her vocal work, and her father for her passion for DJing. “I developed a passion for music from before I could remember,” says Stephens. 
Like every artist, Stephens has gone through her own journey of struggles and feels that finding her sense of self as an artist and remaining true to herself has made her music better than it has ever been. 
“Be true to yourself,” Stephens advises aspiring artists. “There will always be people who want you to sound a certain way or do certain things in the industry, and it is important to take the time to understand yourself. There is always something to learn, even when you feel you are at your best.” 
You can listen to Stephens on Soundcloud at soundcloud.com/classybutdaring and follow her on Facebook at Natasha Stephens. She will be dropping an EP later this summer titled Lust & Indifference.
