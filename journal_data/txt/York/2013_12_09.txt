Holiday tunes that are good, real good!
Maybe it’s the fact that you hear it non-stop in any customer service job for two-plus months, or maybe the kids just don’t like Bing Crosby like they used to. Perhaps it’s because in our angst-ridden early adulthood, a crooner’s release of “Silver Bells” simply doesn’t touch our icy soul. But whatever the reason, it seems that many people at York don’t like holiday music.
If you find the blizzard of Christmas tunes around this time emotionally numbing, infuriatingly catchy, culturally assimilating, too religious, or conversely, too commercial, you’re not alone. It’s part of the lethal holiday mix that drives employees and customers everywhere into a state of rage.
But there may be hope yet for the herds of Christmas-weary students. Not all Christmas music is so bad. Over the last decade or two, the music industry has slowly trudged out some gems by bands a little more worthy of radio play than Susan Boyle.
Here are 15 downloads to put on your next seasonal mixtape:
1. “Did I Make You Cry on Christmas Day? (Well, You Deserved it)” by Sufjan Stevens 
Of the 50 or so Sufjan Stevens Christmas songs on record, this is the best. The instrumentation and Stevens’ shaky, harmonized voice have all the drabness and depression of an office X-mas party, but the overall arrangement is beautifully moving and folksy.
2. “Christmas Lights” by Coldplay 
This single, released in 2010, begins low-key, led solely by a sparkling, effervescent piano, but eventually achieves the kind of grandiose, heavily orchestrated Coldplay heard in “Viva La Vida.” It’s also a rare Christmas tune about heartbreak and relationship problems.
3. “The First Song” by Band of Horses 
The best Christmas songs are those that aren’t actually written for the season — the lyricist just had the holidays on their mind. The vocals in “The First Song” are cried with BoH’s typical uber-reverb, but one of the few clear lines is “Christmas time’s coming.”
4. “I Wish it Was Christmas Today” by Julian Casablancas 
Casablancas, the frontman of The Strokes, does a jingly cover of the song made popular by Saturday Night Live’s Jimmy Fallon, Horatio Sanz, Tracy Morgan, and Chris Kattan. Aside from the expected Casablancas throatiness and danceable beat, the rendition is actually pretty faithful.
5. “It’s Christmas So We’ll Stop” by Frightened Rabbit 
The Scottish indie band’s attempt at a Christmas track is as touching as it is minimalist. Mostly backed only by the carefully composed plucks of an acoustic guitar, the song builds to a swell of choir humming and percussion, and feels like an audio sweater being placed over your shoulders after a sad skating trip.
6. “Are You Coming Over For Christmas?” by Belle and Sebastian 
The Glasgow band’s playful Christmas gem kicks off with a jazzy tone, evoking famous holiday tunes from the 40s, while having the likability of modern indie pop’s most darling act. From there, the duo’s soft and lispy vocals accompany an alternation of big brass and tranquil bass strums.
7. “Candy Cane Children” by The White Stripes 
Maybe the most gritty and unpolished Christmas song of all time, “Candy Cane Children” is actually a somewhat hard find, especially its studio version. Nonetheless, it’s worth the search for Stripes fans, with Jack at his most unhinged, tattering his vocal chords, and Meg slamming those drums like she literally wants to break a record.
8. “All I Want for Christmas” by Yeah Yeah Yeahs 
In a way, this is as Christmas-spirited as you can get: Karen O actually sounds pleasant and a little seductive, and there are some unexpected holiday tropes thrown in: jingle bells behind the sheen of guitar strings, a snowfall tempo, etc. But a sloshed-sounding O dedicates the song to “the people they love” right off the bat, so you can be rest assured this wasn’t some festive cash-in.
9. “I Do Not Care for the Winter Sun” by Beach House 
Some people do not care for Beach House’s too-distant, ice queen sound, but it lends itself well to a winter-themed song. The tune shivers with Christmas loneliness, and is warmed only by the sound of its own sunburst electric guitar. It ends with Charlie Brown-worthy Yuletide lyrics (“it’s all that matters this time of year”) but they’re chilled with a melancholy piano outro.
10. “Xmas Time is Here Again” by My Morning Jacket 
If Radiohead and Fleet Foxes had a disappointingly conventional baby, it would be My Morning Jacket. If nothing else, that baby would’ve been born to perform a hipster Christmas anthem or two. That’s exactly what these bearded boys with bad style did. “Xmas Time is Here Again” is gentle and harmless, a little poignant, and very suggestive of the winter woodsmen in the recording booth.
11. “The Christmas Song” by The Raveonettes 
The most popular of the songs on this list (you’ll definitely hear this in an HMV or Sears around this time), The Raveonettes’ holiday jam is still commendable for its great musicality and for the Danish duo’s reliably haunting, consistent harmony. The lyrics are traditional Christmas schlock, but nothing can take away from moving chord changes and faint guitar wailing.
12. “Got Something for You” by Best Coast and Wavves 
At first, the collaboration between real-life lovers Best Coast and Wavves doesn’t sound so different from a Target Radio choice (because that’s exactly what it was written for). But over two minutes, these Cali surf rock hipsters pull out their own brand of rad, sneaking some garage-rock crunch into a market-friendly exterior.
13. “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” by Death Cab for Cutie 
This one’s kind of a cheat, as you’ll be sick to death of U2’s version by late November, but Death Cab manages to escape the Christmas music trap, turning this “classic” into a fairly traditional yet well-composed indie rock song, with the bonus/detractor of Ben Gibbard’s beautiful voice.
14. “Christmas at the Zoo” by The Flaming Lips 
An upbeat, sort of Christmas-y song, performed by pop rock’s weirdest band. It starts off seasonal enough, with disheveled frontman Wayne Coyne lamenting about the lack of snow on Christmas Eve, but pretty quickly he’s just shouting about monkeys and birds being loose. What else did you expect?
15. “Christmas in Harlem” by Kanye West 
No such list would be complete without Kanye’s sleazy and nostalgic six-and-a-half minute, ghetto-blasting gift to the world. Bringing with him an army of urban music all-stars, West manages to hit a sweet spot in spite of himself, and produce a crude, vulgar, ass-shaking Christmas carol that’s also unexpectedly worthy of a fireside hot chocolate.
With 15 fine Christmas songs at your disposal, you may make it through the holiday toil yet. Get these on a mixtape and block out Kelly Clarkson. You can still have a hipster — I mean, happy – holiday season.

Get your Toronto events on!
 
Have any plans for the coming winter break? If not, here’s a list of cool things in the city that may be of interest to you.
1. For Thrill Seekers or Nature Enthusiasts: 
Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada
Did you have boring and uneventful school trips in school? See what they could have been with this awesome display of rare and colorful marine life. Located near the bottom of the CN Tower, it is the largest indoor aquarium in Canada, with over 16,000 marine animals.
Want to get up close and personal with sharks? I don’t, but for the rest of you brave souls, you can go to the Dangerous Lagoon, a glass-shielded sidewalk that goes right through Jaws-infested waters.
With multiple galleries ranging from aquatic life in our own Great Lakes to the more exotic (and admittedly impressive), you’re bound to have an interesting experience.
2. For Romantics or Photographers:
Christmas Flower Show at Allan Gardens
Are you a thoughtful poet or an artist that looks to nature for creativity? Or do you just need a romantic place to take your angry date?  The Allan Gardens Conservatory is a historic landmark, displaying a beautiful collection of thousands of flowering plants. It would definitely make for some great Instagram shots.
You can even see the gardens by candlelight – so romantic. Oh, and did I mention that it’s free?
3. For Artists or Collectors: 
One of a Kind Christmas Show and Sale at Exhibition Place
Running out of gift ideas for friends and family, or want to give them something handmade? For those of us who are not as crafty, the One of a Kind Christmas Show and Sale displays items made completely by hand, from over 800 artisans.
It is the largest consumer craft show in North America, and has been around since 1975. It’s open until December 8.
4. For Bohemians or Festive People: 
Christmas Market at the Distillery District
Ever thought about going to Europe for Christmas? Ever realized that’s ridiculously expensive? Fill the void by coming down to the Christmas Market at the Distillery District. It’s a traditional, European-style Christmas fair in another cool, historic site, and located right near downtown Toronto.
It’s a great place for shopping, cuisine, and entertainment, and it’s a totally unique experience. The market is open until December 15, and makes for a great, after-exam trip. Also, beer gardens. Cheers!
5. For Readers or Writers or Hipsters: 
Toronto Indie Arts Market at the Gladstone Hotel
Do you love all things indie? Do you love to read? Why not combine your two loves and come to the Toronto Indie Arts Market?  There’s a one-day small press and literary festival happening on December 14. Independent and creative, it’s another unique spot to shop if you’re running out of creative gift ideas.
Your literature-loving friends and family members will love you for it.
6. For Dancers or Classical Music fans or Romantics or Festive People: 
The Nutcracker at the Toronto Center for the Arts
Even if you’re not one for ballet, this show will not disappoint. With beautiful music, choreography, and costumes, it’s a classic story. You can see it on December 20 or 21.
7. For Bad Singers Who Don’t Care or Theatre Buffs: 
Musicals 
What kind of person says no to musicals? And I’m not talking about your average Shakespearean play here, people.  With musicals like Aladdin and Les Misérables, thou shalt never be bored. With singing and dancing, it’s a fun time for everyone, so bring your loved ones along with you.
Just try not to get kicked out for singing along to those catchy numbers.
8. For Samaritans and Everyone: 
Volunteer!
Lastly, and most importantly, this season is not just about buying gifts – it’s about giving back. A quick Google search and you will see that there are many organizations that need volunteers like you.
Even if it’s not specifically related to the holidays, volunteers are always needed and much appreciated, whether it’s here on campus, in your community, or in the city.

With this being our last issue before 2014, it makes sense to reflect a little before moving forward. This year, like any year, changed the world and added its unique stamp on history — politically, socially, and culturally. Here are some of the moments and movements that shaped the last 365 days (give or take a month).
In entertainment:
Just this week, 40-year-old • Fast and the Furious star Paul Walker died, tragically and ironically, in a car crash. Cory Monteith, the 31-year-old star of TV’s Glee, died of a drug overdose in July. Other notable deaths in the entertainment industry this year included singer-songwriter and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed, espionage-fiction writer Tom Clancy, Sopranos star James Gandolfini, and famous film critic Roger Ebert.
As of publication, • Iron Man 3 was the year’s highest grossing film, while Justin Timberlake’s The 20/20 Experience and Eminem’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2 were notably successful albums. Grand Theft Auto V was the top video game, and had the biggest debut of any entertainment release in history.
Gravity• and 12 Years a Slave are currently the frontrunners for Best Picture at next year’s Oscars. The former was a giant leap for mankind in terms of technical innovation; the latter is one of the most brutal accounts of history to come from Hollywood — this decade’s Schindler’s List. 
Breaking Bad • had record ratings for a cable series in its final episodes, and furthermore, cemented its legacy as what some are calling the best television show of all time.
Miley Cyrus and Amanda • Bynes: two famous female tweens grew into raunchy, notorious adults… seemingly in months. Cyrus has found success and new fandom thanks to her racy persona, but Bynes has been deemed mentally unstable due to her self-destructive, concerning online presence.
Events:
The Chelyabinsk Meteor collided with Earth, causing major destruction and injuries in Russia. It was the largest object to enter the planet’s atmosphere in over 100 years.
The Boston Bombing: two  explosives detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring 264. It was one of the most shocking acts of terrorism in the U.S. since 9/11.
Pope Benedict XVI resigned: the first pope to do so in 600 years. He was succeeded by Pope Francis of Argentina.
In April, an eight-story building collapsed in Bangladesh, killing 1,129 people. Over 2,500 more were injured.
November saw one of the  worst natural disasters of the decade: Typhoon Haiyan, which killed 5,653 people in the Philippines and Vietnam.
Prince William and Kate Middleton had their first child together. Prince George, the “Royal Baby,” could hypothetically be king in the future, if the monarchy is kept.
George Zimmerman, who shot and killed an unarmed black man named Trayvon Martin in 2012, was acquitted of the charge, in the year’s most contentious court case.
At York:
Canadian filmmaker and York professor, was imprisoned in Egypt on August 16th, along with Dr. Tarek Loubani. The two-month arrest included a hunger strike. Greyson was finally freed on October 5th.
The subway extension, which is set to bring a stop on the TTC metro system all the way to York in 2015, continued this year. With heavier work underway, there were more bussing delays, and some total reshaping of the campus.
For no good reason but democracy, York’s students voted in favour of a new Student Centre, which will set our financially-challenged school back another few million dollars.
The Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA) have played a major role in recent York University news: security has had alumni protestors leave the campus, a past student was banned for his involvement in a SAIA rally in March, and the group’s official status as a York club was revoked. All of this has contributed to York’s nationally recognized free-speech limitations.
York began construction on a new building for the Lassonde School of Engineering. The construction will cost $85 million, and is set to further diversify the career paths of York graduates. The building is currently aiming for completion in 2015. It will be a massive, artistically unique construction, near Curtis Lecture Hall.
In politics:
Rob Ford: Toronto’s incumbent mayor took his floundering reputation to new heights, after being caught on camera smoking crack cocaine. He later admitted to smoking crack. The story has made Ford the most talked about politician in the world, being the focus of international news (including CNN) and satire (Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show).
Ed Snowden, a computer expert and former CIA employee, divulged 200,000 classified documents to the world in what could be called a lazy remake of the Julian Assange story. Snowden’s revelations gave new perspective on the privacy-slaughtering measures taken for U.S. security.
Syria’s civil conflict continued to escalate into 2013, with the use of extremely controversial chemical warfare on the country’s own people.
In a move from Republicans to get cutbacks in Obamacare, the U.S.’s federal government shut down for a whopping two weeks in October. The move proved futile and fruitless, except that it cost the government billions of dollars.
Two of the most divisive politicians of the last century, former UK prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, and Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, died this year. The latter was still politically active at the time of his death.
