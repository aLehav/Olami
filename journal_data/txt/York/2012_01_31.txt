Another voyeurism incident has been reported at York.
Two female students contacted York security to report that a man had been lurking in the women’s washrooms in the Health Nursing & Environmental Studies building (HNES) around 11:45 a.m. The students alerted security at their booth in Central Square and a Toronto police investigator was called to the site.
When asked if the intruder matched the photos and description of the male at the two previous incidents at the Curtis Lecture Halls and Steacie Library, the students said they could not be certain it was the same person.
More to come.

Back-to-class look
Sometimes it is simple to pull on a hoodie, skip the make-up, and run to class. Can we leave this look for exam week when we’re slaving over exceedingly highlighted textbooks and overheated laptops?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Work Look
After the holidays, it is easy to put less effort in outfits, especially for work. It is important to keep in mind though, you need to maintain a good impression for your boss and customers, whether it is for work or an internship.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Weekend Look
On the weekend, we want to look laid-back and feel comfortable. However, we can still feel comfortable and look good without putting too much thought into our outfit.

Stepping into the Schulich Charity Association’s (SCA) fashion show was like stepping into another world. The green and purple lights, the techno music, and the number of people gathered in the room gave off a futuristic feel, which fit the forward-thinking purpose behind the show itself.
Hosted by the Schulich Charity Association (SCA), the SCA fashion show at The Underground on January 19 showcased the creative talents of York’s alumni and current students.
Jamal Yehia, the SCA’s director of internal logistics, noted that apart from their goal to  ensure that everyone had a good time, the fashion show was there to raise money.
“In terms of raising money, each dollar raised contributes to helping another person’s life,” says Yehia. Every year the SCA, composed primarily of business students, tries to pick one different charity to fund-raise for. This year they picked Ornge, an organization that provides medical transport such as airplanes and helicopters to patients both in the air and on the ground.
Throughout the night, bubbly co-hosts Rob Testa and the current SCA president Lamisse Younis, attempted to entertain the somewhat unresponsive audience, by telling jokes and performing magic tricks. Unfortunately, while the content of their skits was meant to be humorous, the delivery appeared to be highly staged and overly rehearsed. The transparency of Testa’s try-hard quirkiness coupled with the classy sophistication of Younis, however, provided a balance of personalities that made their run-of-the-mill routine satisfactory.
Several local York talents performed during the fashion show: singers Bianca Boldisteanu, Prachi, New Dimesionz Dance Crew, illusionist/magician Rob Testa, Jordan Woods and Sasha Ortega, and the talented and graceful Dia. While most of the acts were forgettable, the only act that really stood out was Dia. Her song and dance routine of “Quando, Quando, Quando” and her rendition of Adele’s “Someone Like You” were absolutely beautiful.
Backstage at the SCA fashion show, things were hectic and busy as half-naked models were running around, trying to race deadline. “It’s crazy back here trying to change,” says one model who was wearing a stunning summer dress designed by the Shweta.
When it came to the fashion designers, the show’s co-directors, James Ious HyunJun Kim and Mariam Siha went for versatile and striking designers.
Upon reviewing the overall show, the performances were unique in their own way. And though there were some awkward moments, the SCA charity fashion show was successful in the sense that it was able to raise money for charity and also in the sense that young local York-bred talents were given the exposure they truly deserved.
Here are the hits and the misses
Mighty Clothing by Richard Park
Richard Park’s collection included a variety of promo unisex T-shirts, which the young designer later admitted that he did not want to originally present at the fashion show. “I gave these shirts to the models, and I’m like ‘Here. Take them. Do whatever you want with them.’”
And his models certainly did whatever they wanted with them. The male and female models came out with different variations of the same T-shirt—ripped, cropped, cut, and tied. Thus, not only was this hot designer’s talent being showcased, but his selected models’ creativity was also under the spotlight. “I just wanted them to have fun with them,” says Park. Park’s line can best be described as comfy, but trendy, with just the right amount of urban flavour, similar to a hipster Drake.
Solace by Shweta Wahi
This adorable and experienced designer wins my award for the most versatile designer of the night. “I’m really stepping out of my comfort zone with these looks! I usually stick to solid colours!” says Wahi. Her work included a vivacious variety of original and colourful designs from cute spring and summer dresses featuring sexy corset backs to more risqué pieces like the leather jumpsuit, also featuring a sexy corset back. This designer managed to capture the perfect Jekyll and Hyde outfits in juxtaposing cute, yet sexy and sophisticated looks. Solace designs could best be described as boho-chic.
Emily Kowalik by Emily Kowalik
The artistic creations of Emily Kowalik were were well-received by several members of the female audience. Her collection included a variety of long and short skirts, as well as blouses with daring and sexy backs. This designer’s strength was certainly her eye for mixing the right fabrics together to create an artsy, yet elegant ensemble. The only weakness is that the designer failed to establish a wide range of colour. Most of her looks were pale shades of pink, brown, and beige.
Sophisticated without being straitlaced, her collection was certainly one of the most original and most classy showcases of the night. Her looks embodied the perfect amount of class and chic. Kowalik’s line can best be described as a feminine/classy American Apparel.
PadinaBondar by Padina Bondar
PadinaBondar’s spectacularly funky, yet classy designs perfectly capture a retro-chic aura. Bondar’s inventive and innovative designs perfectly expresses the term “new age vintage.” Her short and long evening gowns were simultaneously adorable and breathtaking.
The designer demonstrated a wide colour range that very few of the other designers had chosen to pursue. Padina Bondar’s line is part refined, part rave, part flirty, part bold, but a whole lot of fun. Her showcased selection includes highly detailed and embellished embroidery that she masterly tailored into whimsical and feminine evening attire. Padina Bondar’s line can best be described as funky-class.
Fabio Potere by Mohammed Islam
Next down the runway, we were introduced to Mohammed Islam’s collection of men’s sweaters. Apart from his collection of beautiful male models, Fabio Potere left a disappointing impression. Proper, but a bit pretentious, preppy with a twist of hipster, this collection really did not offer much variety in terms of gentleman attire, except for the leather tie. The leather tie, which surprisingly worked very well with the rest of the banal sweaters and cardigans, was the only jaw-dropper. Islam’s line can best be described as metropolitan day-wear or sexy Harry Potter, if you prefer.
Anonymous by Anonymous
Dark, yet alternative; Anonymous’ designs were very original. The designer principally employed monotonous shades of black, white, and grey and constructed some of the most creative, yet simple designs for men and women. Anonymous’ designs gave off a very goth-like, underground look.
Showcasing both men’s and women’s fashion, Anonymous’ designs offered a fair range of grungy, yet chic apparel. The Anonymous line just looked comfortable—a casual comfort that had exuded just enough elegance that the clothing could pass for a night out on the town. Unfortunately, about fifty per cent of Anonymous’ showcase was wearable, whereas the other fifty per cent? Well, let’s just keep that half anonymous. Anonymous designs could best be described as threadbare, but fashion-forward.

Award-winning filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici’s documentary about terror bombing in Israel is about conflicts everywhere
Jasmine Saroya
Contributor

For many, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just another conflict of many. The loss of human life, of real people who occupy more than meagre lines on a ledger, is one we don’t often contemplate.
According to Simcha Jacobovici, three-time Emmy award-winning documentary filmmaker and the visionary behind Impact of Terror, our media reduces real human tragedies into numbers. His film about terror bombing screened in the Nat Taylor Cinema on January 17 for three separate film classes.
Jacobovici described his interest in making the documentary as having arisen after viewing much of the coverage of the Second Intifada, the period of Israeli-Palestinian conflict from 2000 to 2005.
“It was all about stats—it wasn’t about people,” Jacobovici said.
It is exactly this trend in journalism which he seeks to correct with his film. Centred on the 2001 Sbarro restaurant bombing in Jerusalem, the documentary explores the lives of the survivors and the relatives of the deceased three years after the attack.
At times, it is grisly, showing footage of the victims with blood streaming down their faces. At others times, it is emotionally draining, telling the story of one victim, a teenage boy, who developed an obsessive-compulsive tendency of constantly cleaning his clothes, believing that he would never truly be clean of the flesh and blood strewn across his body on that day.
The memories of that day still resonate for many of those victims. Interviewee Arnold Roth describes the situation in Israel as being an onslaught of “world-changing events, over and over,” and says that, “as a society [they] are going through earthquakes.”
Addressing the audience after the screening, Jacobovici commented on the lack of media coverage given to conflicts such as the Murle-Luo Nuer conflict in Sudan, or the ongoing conflict in the Congo.
“Do any of you know who the Murle people are?” Jacobovici asked. After no sign of a response, he continued to talk of the disparities in death tolls, and that the death tolls of aforementioned conflicts vastly outnumber that of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“What is the motivation [for this biased coverage]?” he asked.
Such are the kinds of questions raised by Impact of Terror, a film that ultimately exposes the true nature of all ongoing global conflicts, not just the one between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Whether the death toll for one conflict is higher than another is irrelevant. Every one of these conflicts deserves attention, because they concern the lives of real people—not statistics.
