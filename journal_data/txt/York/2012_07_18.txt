Kelvin Guzman, 22, faces two counts of break-and-enter, one count of sexual assault, and one count of possession of property obtained by crime.
According to the Toronto police report, the accused also broke into a home July 7 around 5 a.m., and sexually assaulted an 18-year-old girl. Property was also taken from the Broadoaks Drive home upon exit.
Around the same time July 12, the accused entered the Village home of a 22-year-old woman on Assiniboine Road. Police released surveillance video footage July 13 of the the man opening her door on the balcony. The woman was sleeping and woke up to the accused kneeling next to her bed. The woman screamed, and both she and the accused fled the building.
Guzman appeared in court Wednesday at 2 p.m.
