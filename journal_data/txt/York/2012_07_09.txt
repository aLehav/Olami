Toronto police say they have arrested and charged a 20-year-old man this evening after at least three women were sexually assaulted on York’s campus last week.
The suspect faces a total of seven charges including three counts of sexual assault, two counts of criminal harassment, and two counts of assault, according to police.
Police say they believe there may be more victims.
While York has consistently reported a total of four sexual assaults took place Thursday July 5 on the Keele campus, Toronto police reported on Monday that there have been three incidents.
Police reported two sexual assaults occurred on Thursday at approximately 3:30 p.m. and one occurred on Friday at 3 p.m., later saying that all three incidents actually took place on Thursday.
An investigation by Toronto police’s sex crimes unit began when York security services notified police about several sexual assaults that occurred an hour apart from each other on Thursday afternoon near Vari Hall.
Students were warned about the recent series of sexual assaults and provided with details of the reported incidents in a security bulletin e-mail sent out to all York students from Janet K. Morrison, vice-provost students at around 3:45 p.m. on Monday.
Toronto resident Oshane Leach is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday morning.
