Police are investigating after a woman was robbed at gunpoint in the Village on Sunday night.
On March 24 at 11:43 p.m., a 20-year-old woman was walking on Assiniboine Road, near Hackett Road in the Village, when she was approached by a man who pulled out a black handgun and demanded she hand over her cell phone, police say.
Once the woman complied, the male suspect got into a vehicle driven by a second suspect and fled the scene, police say.
Police are in search of a five-foot-seven black male with a thin build and black curly hair. He was last seen wearing a yellow jacket with the word “Security” in black lettering on the back, black pants, and black-framed eyeglasses.
Police say they do not know whether or not the victim was a York student.
There is no description available for the second suspect who was driving, police say. The suspect’s vehicle is described as “an older tan SUV or minivan.”
