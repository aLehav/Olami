As a kid, I couldn’t wait to grow upI looked at adultsTalking among themselvesEngaged in a languageThat I couldn’t understandBut the only reply I’d get was“You’d understand when you’re older.”But as I started to grow upI realized that adults have their own demonsThey always have something to hideSomething to protect,Something to defendThey protect their secretsAnd guard it with their livesThey lie, they cheat, they self sabotageThey get stuck in this endless mirageOf trying to live this perfect lifeTrying to make other people happyBlinded by their own realityOnly to have their hearts brokenWhen things don’t work outThe way they had hoped.We get so wrapped upWith the wishes of our familiesOur shoulders heavyWith the weight of responsibilities,We try to follow the same pathBut we’re scared to live our livesThe way we please
But there’s also something so liberatingAbout finally being an adultSomething so freeing aboutChoosing who you want to beSeeing the things, the placesThe people we’ve always wanted to seeBuilding your dream houseTraveling from one country to the nextTo see which culture, you like the bestTo eat food you’ve never triedTo sit down near the seasAnd see the different colors of the sky;To meet new people and hear their storiesTo find out the similaritiesYou never knew you had;To know that you’re never truly aloneBecause in a world full of peopleWho have lived a million different livesThere would be thousands of peopleWho would make you feel grateful to be aliveBecause in my opinion,It’s the best part of being an adultThe ability to choose what you believe inWhether it’s love, a lifestyle or a religion;We have the liberty to chooseWhat’s worth fighting for,Or what we got to let goEven with billions of people out thereWe always have a place to reinvent ourselvesTo change, to grow.
