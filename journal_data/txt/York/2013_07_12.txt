That’s so disgusting. … The fact that it’s a couple of years old surprises me. .. I think the media doesn’t see it as much of a serious thing as it should be, and it should be addressed in a more serious way.

It was really gross how even the girls were going along with it. I thought at least someone would say “this is wrong”.

It’s got no place in society. … I don’t think there’s been enough coverage of it. … It should be viewed in the same light as harassment if you ask me.

There are so many sexual assaults that happen at universities, especially during frosh week, when people don’t know what sexual assault is. They don’t know what the boundaries are. So it’s ignorant to tell people to sexually assault someone.

That doesn’t make it alright, just because you did it (the chant) your first year doesn’t mean you have to spread on the tradition of saying “rape” and doing all that. When I was in frosh, the chants were just like the YU chant, that’s it, it wasn’t anything derogatory or anything like that. And the fact that people were allowing that to go on for years is pretty messed up in itself because it shows that they want to promote it and not stop it.

I had no idea why they’d do that. I don’t like to judge if I don’t have all the information but honestly, I don’t see why you would want to promote rape or promote sex with underage girls. It sounds like they just want to make a statement to be heard or for publicity’s sake.
