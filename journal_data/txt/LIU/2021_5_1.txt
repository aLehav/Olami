The Brooklyn Nets currently sit with a record of 43-21. They are on a roll with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant taking the lead with an injured James Harden. Alongside some new additions, such as Blake Griffin, they have the potential to win the Eastern Conference. 
With superstar Kevin Durant fresh off an injury, it’s like he never left. He’s currently averaging 27 points per game(PPG) on 54% shooting while adding six rebounds a game and five assists.  
His partner in crime, Kyrie Irving, has also been solid, averaging 26.9ppg,  five rebounds and over six assists. Kyrie gets criticized for the personal time he takes off or the load managing on the court, but it doesn’t seem to affect his play or the Nets organization. With just two of their superstars, the Nets are causing problems for the NBA. With Harden returning rested and the playoffs coming soon, it would not be a bad idea to choose The Nets as a favorite.
The Nets are an all-around team with their mid-season acquisitions, but they’ve yet to have everyone on the court simultaneously with Durant’s injuries, Kyrie’s personal time and Harden’s current injury. Chemistry would be the only concern about this Nets team.
Freshman Nets fan Ayinde Johnson believes if any team in the Eastern Conference has a chance at stopping Brooklyn, it would be the Philadelphia 76ers.
“Philly most likely, they match up the best with them defensively and size, but that doesn’t mean they’ll stop the Nets. Kevin Durant is just a scoring machine,” he said. “He could score with defenders in his face with ease and with so many other playmakers to help. It comes down to whatever is better, the Nets offense or the 76ers defense.” 
With dynasty potential, the Nets are looking strong now and for years to come. This big three in Harden, Durant, and Kyrie are like no other New York has. While they continue to battle night in and night out with only a few games left, the Nets should be closing in on their playoff spot and the chance to fight for the NBA Championship.

Senior communications major Dylan Valic began his journey at Post from a young age. 
Hailing from New Hyde Park, Valic attended many summer camps at LIU. 
“It was a great time,” Valic said. “The campus was really pretty, and the people were so cool. I knew I had to come here.” 
By his senior year of high school, Valic had toured a number of schools, but decided on Post. 
“I toured other schools like Hofstra, but I decided on Post,” he said. “I knew I wanted to stay on Long Island, and it seemed like the best fit.” 
Originally, Valic wanted to be a business major, but a faculty member’s recommendation changed his mind. 
“I was in this communications class, and the professor suggested that I join the paper,” Valic said. “I joined and started as a staff writer. I was hooked in seconds.” 
Valic then changed his major to communications, with two minors in journalism and business. 
“After being a staff writer, I joined the editorial board as editor of the Features section,” he said. “Soon after, I was offered the position of editor-in-chief. It’s a little tedious to have to stay up past midnight to get the layout of the paper all set up, but it’s worth it.” 
In addition to the school newspaper, Valic was also involved with PTV and WCWP News. 
“This made me feel more well-rounded,” Valic said. “I got to augment my communications skills in both visual and written forms.” 
During the summer of 2020, Valic held an internship with the Long Island Herald. 
“COVID kind of screwed things up, trying to meet people in person and all,” he said. “But it was a great experience nonetheless.” 
Valic said that he hasn’t decided on an exact career path yet, but knows he wants to stay in the field of communications. 
“I’ll see where life takes me,” he said. “I’m looking to stay in New York for now, but I may look elsewhere in the future. Communication is a broad field, and there’s plenty of options.”
Valic expressed his gratitude for the support from students and faculty at Post, and who worked with him on the Pioneer. 
“Without them, I wouldn’t be where I am today,” he said. “I’ve made some amazing connections with faculty and students. I’m really going to miss these guys.” 
In his spare time, Valic can be found reading, writing, playing video games, and spending time with his friends and family.

Senior broadcasting major Jada Harrison knew that she wanted to enter the field of broadcasting when she got a taste of the field in high school.
“When I was in high school, I actually wanted to major in marine bio and I think it was my junior or senior year, our school got a TV studio and I took the class and I really liked it, but I’ve always liked the news and TV and stuff like that. So, I guess the class really showed me the other side of all that and I decided to apply to schools for that major,” she said.
She feels that broadcasting does a lot to help others. 
“In this day and age, I feel like it keeps people entertained and keeps people going, not even just news but radio and all types of media,” she said
Broadcasting isn’t as simple as it may seem, including many different parts to ensure a broadcast turns out successfully. One can work in sound, lighting, directing, producing and engineering on the radio side. The broadcasting major has many layers to it that she feels people don’t realize. Harrison wants to apply her broadcasting skills by being in the background of a television production.
Harrison’s dream job would be to work for CBS, because they have been more diverse lately and the network is well known. If she’s on the news or a talk show, Harrison would prefer to make content for those in their 30s and 40s. And if she were to do pop-culture work, she’d cater to people who are late teens to early 20s.
  Harrison is a fan of television and has watched a lot of TV in her time. She loves HBO, CBS, FX and MSNBC. She used to like MTV when she was younger, but she finds now that it has changed too much.
Harrison prefers BBC for fair and balanced news coverage. She feels like channels like CNN are more left leaning, and that causes them not to show everything. The issue of polarization is definitely an issue in today’s political climate. 
Harrison’s advice for the underclassmen in her program would be to try everything related to broadcasting, and find out what you like.
“Try everything on both sides of broadcasting. Definitely try to get an internship. I unfortunately haven’t found one yet, but I think testing everything and seeing where you can apply those skills in different areas is important,” she said.

The Studio Art Club will be saying farewell to forensic science senior Emily Ruben this semester. Ruben is a two year vice president of the club alongside her best friend Cassidy Shankar, and has done a lot to keep the club engaging and active in the campus community. 
“When the club started out, we had only a few members, mostly due to our lack of exposure. We wanted to get our name out there so we came up with some cool events and meeting ideas that made us into the club we are today,” she said. 
Emily gives credit to Shankar for pioneering the idea for the club, it has become an outlet for students of all majors to show off their talent and creativity in ways their everyday studies may not let them. 
“The Studio Art Club is a club for all majors. It’s main purpose is to gather those who have an interest in art but do not have the time in their day to pursue it, like me. As a forensic science major, I am often unable to express my creativity as I would like to. But this club has given me that, and helped in growing my strongest friendships that I have today.”
It is fair to say that in her time at Post, Ruben has been privileged enough to experience the many opportunities that are available to students. 
“My favorite experience I had with LIU Post was in my sophomore year. The Honors College was able to fund an entire trip to Costa Rica for just my roommate and I with a program named ‘Partners in the Parks.’ We were given the amazing opportunity to spend a week in Costa Rica’s National Park, Juan Castro Blanco,” she said. “Traveling abroad for the first time independently was a fantastic experience, one that I am so grateful to have had. Being a part of the Honors College definitely enhanced my time here at Post for many reasons such as this one.“
Ruben has some advice for incoming freshmen and hopes for the future of the art club as she moves on to the next journey in her life.
“The best advice I can give to any student is to make connections. With faculty, staff and friends. The more professional and social connections you make throughout college, the better your experience will be, both before and after school is finished,” she said. “I will be graduating this upcoming May. I am honored to pass the torch down to Alexa Jones, who will be taking over as acting VP. I hope in our creation of the Studio that those who love art, found a place to express it in their spare time.”

Senior communications major Chris Trick has had numerous experiences at LIU that have helped shape him into the person he is today. Originally coming to LIU to be an English teacher, Trick has changed career paths multiple times on his college journey, exploring options in both journalism and business, as well as a possible career in marketing. 
During his time at Post, Trick joined multiple clubs including the Newman Club, the Institute for the Study of Democracy and Liberalism, as well as writing for the campus radio station and newspaper. Trick was also on the committee that organized the freshman common read during his sophomore year.
Trick is currently exploring multiple options for possible career paths, deciding between attending law school or pursuing a career in marketing. His dream job would to one day become an executive manager, following in the footsteps of other members of his family who hold executive positions in finance.
Another career Trick would be interested in pursuing would be an on air host for a political talk show, such as Fox News, which would allow him to pursue his interest in journalism. Trick considers himself to be unbiased, which would make him a good candidate for the position, but does not want to associate with the toxic nature of politics. 
Outside of school Trick is a lector at his local church, a position that allowed him to improve his public speaking skills and advocate for causes that he is passionate about. 
Trick also enjoys a multitude of hobbies such as reading, writing, exercising, watching television and spending time with friends and family.
After graduation, Trick plans to move away from Long Island, preferably to the south. He doesn’t have a concrete plan of action set yet, but is waiting to see what life has in store for him.
“I’m seeing where life takes me right now, because I’ve learned that you can’t plan everything but that life can be very pleasant sometimes and surprise you in ways that perhaps one could not have imagined,” he said.

Graduating senior and theatre arts major Anastacia Muñoz is leaving Post with a plethora of accolades to their name, and what’s certain to be a very bright future ahead of them. Throughout her time here, Muñoz has been incredibly involved in the theatre department, where she’s spearheaded both student projects and entire organizations. However they haven’t ever limited themselves in their scope of involvement, and they’re leaving Post with a wide array of memories they’ve gotten to experience from all over campus. 
Muñoz’s collegiate journey actually began elsewhere, but transferring to Post’s theatre program gave her the rigorous theatre training she wanted out of a collegiate experience. 
“I was a student at another university in the midwest, and I was not getting the training that I wanted as an actor” Muñoz said. “I did a bunch of walk-in auditions & that is where I met Dave Hugo, his honesty, in addition to the incredible training, sold me on coming to LIU for their theater program.”
As a Post student, Muñoz dove headfirst into their involvement in the school’s theatre department. The Emerging Student Theatre Artists (ESTA) club was one way they were able to make the most out of being involved in the theatre community on campus. 
“Joining ESTA, for me, was a no brainer,” Muñoz said. Not only were they an active participant, they would eventually be elected as an e-board member of the organization.
“In my four years at Post, I was able to hold two positions on the e-board, the marketing position my junior year & the co-president this year. Additionally, I was in Katz the Musical as Old Deuteronomy, Ensemble in Once On This Island and I directed the Anonymous Seussical the Zoomsical.”
Muñoz’s involvement in the theatre department hardly ended with their commitment to ESTA. During her time at Post, she also performed in multiple mainstage shows, was selected as a company coach, a senior leadership position in the theatre department and worked in the school’s costume shop, all of which they look back on fondly as their time here is coming to a close. 
“My favorite memories include teaching every incoming freshmen class how to sew, being a part of the inaugural Shakespeare class, and being chosen as a Company Coach,” she said. 
Though the theatre department remained her priority over her time here, Muñoz never limited themselves in their involvement on campus, and she harbors fond memories from a plethora of different experiences at Post. 
“Within the school, my favorite memory would have to be making new friends while working at the Tilles Center,” they said. 
Though they’ll certainly be missed as a Post student, Muñoz already has exciting plans lined up for her future, which will certainly lead her to be as successful in life as they’ve been here on campus. With the rigorous training they’ve received here, and the skills they’ve formulated through their incredibly thorough involvement at school, she’s leaving Post more than prepared to tackle the theatre industry at large.
“After I graduate in May, I will be a Teaching Artist Trainee at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta, Georgia for the summer, where I plan on moving to start my tv, film and theater career,” Muñoz said. “I want my future to be surrounded by the arts whether it be performing on a stage or a screen, running my own theater company or teaching a new generation the power of theater.”

Nicholas Frank is a graduating senior with a game design major and a digital design minor whose contributions to Post range from his work in the game design programs to his advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community here on campus. Frank’s involvement in the Post community has certainly left its mark on campus, and it’s this same work ethic that is sure to propel him to great heights as he launches into the next chapter of his life.
Frank, who is a native of Long Island, came to Post because it allowed him the opportunity to pursue everything he wanted to in his collegiate experience, while still being in this area he was already familiar with. 
“I was able to get a digital design minor alongside a game design major, something that was harder to find than expected among Long Island colleges,” Frank said. “It was also a chance to be able to stay in touch with my best friend from high school.”
Shortly after coming to campus, Frank’s involvement in the school’s LGBTQ+ community began to take shape. Rainbow Alliance had previously been part of the campus community, but as Frank was beginning his time as a student on campus, the club was about to come to an end. 
“I can hardly remember a point where Rainbow Alliance wasn’t a thought of mine. But after an amazing drag show event, the club suddenly came to an end,” Frank said . 
Working alongside other members of Post’s LGBTQ+ community, Frank was able to revitalize the club and bring it back to campus in full force.
“I don’t think there was a chance that the revitalization would have happened had it not been for Nicole Ludwig,” he said, “we did a lot as a club, ranging from fun activities like haunted houses to having guest speakers come and have talks on more critical aspects of being queer such as coming out.”
Reflecting on his work for the school’s LGBTQ+ community, it isn’t so much the events he was able to pull together that stand out to Frank, but rather the people and the friendships he was able to foster through Rainbow Alliance. 
“What I’ll remember the most is how we fostered a community. In our first year, we already started to see freshmen using the club as a social gateway into meeting others who respected and accepted them,” Frank said. “From that point on, I considered the club to be a success.”
Though Frank certainly has a plethora of memories from Rainbow Alliance that he looks back on fondly in reflecting on his experience at Post, it’s the hard work and the smaller moments with friends that stand out to him when reflecting on his time here. 
“I’ll always think of my work and the struggles of sitting behind my laptop coding late into the night when I think Post,” Frank said, “but I’ll be sure to think of the nights where my roommate said something ridiculously hilarious enough that it took me three minutes to stop laughing.” He kept a cherished record of moments like this on his quote wall: “the place where I kept the moments that I truly wanted to remember,” he said.
Looking to the future, Frank is excited to apply the skills he’s learned studying here at Post as he starts his career. 
“I plan to pursue work in game design and graphic design and see where that takes me, whether it’s independent or for a studio,” he said. 
However, it’s the moments outside of work that Frank is looking forward to most. His love of music, and community, as well as a bit of wanderlust are what he wants to prioritize leaving Post. 
“What I truly plan to do after the semester, and after the pandemic, is go to concerts, and go to new places. Post taught me a lot about what I know, NYC taught me a lot about who I am and what I like, kudos to my boyfriend for that, and there’s a lot more out there to try to explore.”

Senior directing major and writing minor Kylie Brown has done it all. She has written shows, directed them, worked at the writing center, been Co-Editor-in-Chief at The Bottom Line and more. 
Originally from Pennsylvania, Brown moved to Long Island for college after visiting LIU and feeling like it was the right fit for her. “I was drawn to the approximation to the city,” Brown said.
Brown’s mother grew up on the island, but the move was far from home for her. Since Brown’s freshman year, she has worked in the writing center, and has written for The Bottom Line.
“The Bottom Line is a literary magazine and it’s a place for students to share their voices through the written word,” Brown said.
The Bottom Line accepts submissions of all genres. They feature short stories, poetry, essays of all genres, as well as art and photography.
Brown became Co-Editor-in-Chief when the graduate students who ran The Bottom Line were getting ready to graduate. “They came to the writing center staff as the most obvious choice, and me and Izzy volunteered together and it’s been really fun,” Brown said.
Brown and Izzy Petrovsky have taken over the literary magazine this year and haven’t looked back. 
“The bottom line of the Bottom Line is that it’s for student’s to share their creative voices,” Brown said.
A large project Brown undertook this year was directing the full length play, “The Wolves.” Though this wasn’t Brown’s first directing experience here, it was her largest, and her favorite. The show was part of Post Theatre Company’s spring main stage season.
Brown directed a group of actors all the way up until filming, and captured the entire production on film before it was sent out for viewing. 
Brown has written an abundance of material for the university. Her favorite issue of the Bottom Line would have to be the fall issue titled “Emerging.” This issue had many pieces that revolved around coming out, and emerging from quarantine.
“It had a wide range of interpretations of the work emerging, it was really special,” Brown said. 
Due to the pandemic, Brown had to do more recruiting for the magazine than usual. People were spread out on account of social distancing, therefore more people came out to write than would normally be expected. People from all walks of life on campus participated.
Brown mentioned students from all over the country, even students who had taken the year off. The issue had a more diverse range of submissions than ever before.
  After this semester, Brown has a few different jobs lined up. She is a freelance writer for a writing and marketing company as well as Study.com. “I’ll be doing that and some freelance work on my own as I send out self tapes to theatre companies and film projects,” Brown said.
Brown’s writing and directing skills will be missed on campus, but she will be needed out in the real world. Brown leaves the Bottom Line, and underclassmen with a final word of encouragement and recruitment.
“Anyone who enjoys writing or art in any capacity should totally feel free to come to a meeting or submit a piece, we are happy to work with you, we are just excited to give everyone a chance to share their voice on campus,” Brown said.

Gregory P. Franz is only a few weeks away from graduating. After having his last three semesters of college happen virtually, he is ready for the COVID-19 pandemic to end.
Both Franz’s mother and sister attended LIU, and Franz knew it was a perfect fit for him when he visited the campus. “I was following in the footsteps of my family and I thought it was a great atmosphere, particularly for me, so I decided to come here,” Franz said.
Franz is majoring in music education. As part of the program, he was required to be part of CNAFME, the collegiate chapter of the National Association for Music Education.
Franz followed in his sister’s footsteps and became the president of CNAFME. Franz wanted to become president because he supports the mission of the organization, and wanted to help fulfill it.
“Essentially we’re volunteering our time to the public schools for music,” Franz said. 
As someone who is passionate about music, this hits close to home for Franz. At the all-county performances, the best kids from each school district get to come together to perform. The CNAFME organization volunteers at these events.
“When I was in public school I had a great experience with that, so I wanted to give back,” Franz said. 
As president, Franz got to help with those events, organize fundraisers and guest speakers. This year, Franz had a different job as president, because he was inducted right as the pandemic hit.
Franz described his job as more of a “morale check-in” to make sure everyone was okay in these trying times.
“I said let’s not try to bang out requirements for music education, let’s make sure that every one of us is okay,” Franz said. 
Franz has been in charge of a club during an unconventional time, but has tried to keep everything interesting. There have been various virtual events, such as a Bob Ross paint night. Franz recalls this event as his favorite CNAFME memory.
Franz’s favorite show through CNAFME was a coffee house fundraiser that was semi-live. They invited kids from five close school districts, and some even performed. 
“It wasn’t just us anymore, it was community outreach and the kids got a creative outlet during covid,” Franz said.
Franz was able to bring music to a community that has been isolated and deprived of events such as these.
As far as next year goes, like many seniors Franz does not have any plans set in stone. He is in the final round of interviews for the Royal Conservatory of Scotland for Masters of Music Direction. At this point he is just looking for jobs as well.
Franz has been part of his own program as well as the theatre program. He has played in the pit for shows such as “The Wild Party” and last year’s Dance Cabaret. He has also helped arrange music for the program. He is considered extremely valuable to many at this school, and will be missed.
Many wish Franz the best, and cannot wait to see what he does in the future.
