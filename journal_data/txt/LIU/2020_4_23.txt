Hayley Cohen is graduating with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Throughout her college journey Cohen has met new people, tried new things and has flourished her love for business.
Cohen got an associate’s degree in merchandise marketing from the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles before attending Post. She originally wanted to get involved with the fashion industry, but later decided she would rather be involved in business.
Cohen’s dream is to be involved in public relations (PR) in some way. She first found her passion for PR when she participated in an internship for the PR department of David Yurman, a designer jewelry company. Cohen worked as a PR coordinator, an experience that she described as being better then any internship or job she has ever had.
Cohen’s new found love for public relations is what brought her to Post so that she could pursue her new career path. She chose to attend Post because it was highly recommended by her sister who took classes at both the Post and Brooklyn campuses and because she loved the environment of the campus when she visited it.
While fashion was her original passion, she has since expanded her horizons and is open to working in PR for any industry.
At first the transition to life at Post was a jarring one because of how different it was compared to her old school. Cohen described the student bodies of her old school and Post as being vastly different, so attending both universities has allowed her to meet many different kinds of people. Her old school was also almost entirely made up of female students, so having such a large amount of male students on campus was different than what she was used to.
Attending Post has helped Cohen broaden her horizons and try new things. “Probably one of my favorite classes I took at Post was forensic chemistry for a lab credit,” she said. “I thought I was going to hate it but it was actually really interesting.”
Cohen’s favorite experience from her time at Post was writing for the Pioneer. “I’m not too social, so it helped me get to know more people, and reach out to more people, and use my voice a little more,” she said.

As the Spring 2020 semester comes to a close, so do many graduating seniors college careers. One student who made sure he had a memorable experience was broadcasting major Luis Viloria.
As a Bethpage native, LIU was the only other local school besides Nassau that he was accepted into. He joined the campus in 2015 and has been making the most of it ever since.
“I always like filming and was fascinated with video production and all of the behind the scenes aspects of a show,” Viloria said. “The HBO show ‘Newsroom’ had a big impact on me and was why I decided to pursue news production specifically.”
Viloria enjoyed his time at Post, and the friends that he met. He also said that getting involved with the campus news station and getting a job there was one of the best decisions of his college career.
“It was a great way to get to know all the communications majors,” Viloria said. The campus Television station, or PTV, is located in Humanities Hall, and is where Viloria spent most of his time.
A major project that he became involved with during his college career was the show “All Access Lounge.” Filming it, especially the last season, was truly special for Luis. Everyone involved with All Access, as well as broadcasting students in general, have always been about to count on Luis.
“Luis is one of my good friends, he has been there to support me in everything I do,” Ashley Damis, senior broadcasting major and a good friend of Viloria, said. “That’s rare these days, I struggled finding internships and he sat there and watched me apply to 30 internships before I could leave school and go home.”
Thanks to Viloria’s help, Damis was able to get an internship.
“He told me at least five people should contact you and they did, I finally got an internship because of him pushing me to apply. I thank him all the time because he played such a big part in my success,” Damis said. “Luis has an amazing energy and is so friendly he truly is a lifelong friend I will always have. He’s been there through so many of my journeys during my four years at LIU and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for him. Luis is hardworking and puts all of his creativity into all of his work he produces.”
Viloria touched many people’s lives while he was pursuing his career at LIU, and he will be greatly missed.
“I wouldn’t change anything, all the good and the bad helped me become the person I am today and were necessary for my self growth,” he said.

The Pioneer gained a lot more than a copyeditor when Chicago-native Ashley Bowden joined in 2016. Since then she has become co-editor-in-chief leading the Pioneer staff and writing more than 50 stories in the process.
In fall of 2016, Bowden moved to New York to study acting at Post. “The main thing I wanted was a change of scenery and to be able to say I actually went to New York since it’s some place that has always been intriguing to me. I got to see new places and meet new people that I wouldn’t have seen or experienced if I’d just stayed put at home.”
Bowden was recruited her second semester on campus by Professor Carolyn Levin and an email from the honors college saying the Pioneer was looking for a copyeditor. “Four years later I never left. I guess I just kind of fell in love with the practice,” Bowden said.
Bowden said that she is going to miss all the Pioneer staff members, who she considers to be like family, and all of the friends she has made on campus. Bowden never had a chance to say a proper goodbye to her friends due to classes being moved to a virtual format, and due to the ongoing pandemic doesn’t know when she will have an opportunity to do so.
“I don’t know when I’m gonna get to give those goodbye hugs to everybody I don’t see anymore,” she said.
During her time at Post Bowden has written over 50 stories for the Pioneer and won three awards. Some of her favorite recent articles have been “Liberal Arts and Sciences Programs Face Degree Cuts” and “Fraternity Creates a Safe Space to Discuss Race and Gender.”
“I am really proud of the story I did at the event to discuss race and gender, it was a black fraternity event and only black people showed up to it. Even though I was supposed to be on the outside reporting it, it was a moment of community for me that I didn’t know I needed until I was in that environment with those people discussing things that I could only discuss in that kind of atmosphere,” she said. “And I’m glad I could get a story out that could make people think about things they don’t really realize when they are walking around campus. It was a really great story because it offers another perspective to what people don’t normally think about perhaps.”
Bowden is grateful for the Pioneer for teaching her important leadership, time management and social communication skills. “That’s been my favorite part of this, just learning how to do all that because those are skills I want to take with me moving forward into the workforce, I’m very proud of that,” she said.
Writing for the Pioneer wasn’t the only activity Bowden participated in on campus. She was also involved with the Post Theatre Company and helped to put on many productions. Bowden said one her favorite productions was her portrayal of Chrysothemis in “Iphigenia and Other Daughters.”
“I was very proud, that was junior year, that was the first principle character role so I worked really hard on it and everybody was really supportive and said you were the perfect person to cast as this role and I couldn’t see her as any other actor,” she said. “That just felt great that I could make that line disappear between the actor and the character. It was a really proud moment for me.”
Something Bowden will never forget about Post was her professors and the impact they had on her collegiate career. “Maria Porter is an icon in the post theatre department and she’s basically like a mama bear of the theatre department and she’s been so supportive of me as all the faculty members have been even when I did decide to change my career path, it didn’t feel like I was leaving the PTC family at all,” she said. “[I’m] definitely gonna miss my professors like her and I already miss professor Levin. I’ve missed her for a while now.”
While Bowden is moving back to Chicago, she has fond memories of New York including visiting Central Park and going to her first Broadway musical “Wicked.”
While she is graduating with a degree in acting, Bowden is hoping to pursue journalism as a career and has applied to a couple of magazines for editorial positions.
“Even though I’m gonna graduate with a theatre degree, I’m gonna work to pursue a career in journalism and hope that my theatre career just gives me a leg up because I want to go into performing arts journalism,” she said. “Even though my degree says acting, all my resumes say journalist.”

Senior Shannon Miller decided she wanted to go back to college after having the same administrative job for a construction company for 16 years. She earned an associate’s degree in Liberal Arts & Sciences: Humanities with an emphasis on writing at Suffolk Community College. She then applied for a scholarship called the “Stay on Long Island Initiative Scholarship” that paid for her to get a bachelor’s degree in journalism at Post.
Miller has loved writing since she was a child, often turning her life into screenplays and even writing song lyrics. She remembers writing weekly stories for her friends to read.
When Miller’s father passed away, she had to become an adult overnight, leaving her to tie up his estate. She was left to deal with legal figures and real estate agents who took advantage of her financially due to her age and fragile state.
“I realized how much corruption there was in the world, and well, my only weapon at the time was my ability to write about it,” she said.
These experiences, in addition to her interest in politics, invoked intense passion for writing that resulted in pursuing a career in journalism.
“My desire to be a journalist stems from my desire to be a voice for the voiceless, a voice for everyday people, the middle man between the common folk and chieftains,” Miller said.
During her time at Post, Miller was a full-time student who had a full-time job and a husband. Some she met on campus inspired her, such as Jada Butler, the former co-editor-in-chief of the Pioneer.
“Jada Butler welcomed me with open arms when I first transferred here,” Miller said. “She showed me the ropes of the newspaper, and although much younger, taught me so much.”
Miller built relationships with some professors like Susan Zeig, Barbara Fowles and Jean Carlomusto, who have inspired her with great advice in the world of journalism.
“And I must make a special shout out to Travis Fortounas and Ali Ferragamo for being two of the coolest people I’ve gotten to know while at Post,” Miller said.
Adjusting to Post was different for Miller because she was taking classes with students almost 20 years younger than her.
“After a few months, I grew to understand [the younger students] and learned that we all had the same passions and interests, only difference was, they were Machine Gun Kelly, Snapchat, Spotify and ‘Twilight,’ and I was Eminem, AOL, FM Radio and ‘The Babysitters Club.’”
Miller’s best experience during her time at Post was when she and Ida Ynner Lagerqvist, the Pioneer’s sports and photo editor, were invited to The New York Times Student News Editor Workshop.
“It was a surreal moment in my life, unlike any other,” Miller said. “To receive guidance and instruction from some of the most accomplished reporters in the world, in the greatest city in the world, with Ida, who because of that day, has become one of my greatest friends in the world, is something I will never forget.”
Miller started on the Pioneer as assistant news editor the second semester of her junior year. She then became news and managing editor the first semester of her senior year. And this semester, she is co-editor-in-chief.
After graduating, Miller plans on applying to jobs that will allow her to continue following her dreams in journalism and the news industry.
“Hopefully I will go on a really nice vacation,” Miller said. She is also thinking about having a baby.
Miller shared some advice that she wished someone had told her when she was younger:
“Enjoy this time as much as you possibly can, because you’ll never get it back. Choose who and what you devote your time and energy to wisely, because more than likely, 15 years from now, it will either make all the difference in the world or none at all, there is no in between. Write things down because eventually your memory will begin to fail you. Pay your bills because they’ll only add up and make your future unnecessarily difficult. Be nice to your parents, as one day, you’ll wake up and they’ll be gone. Make mistakes and learn from them. Cherish the good times and take lots of pictures. Trust but verify—speak softly but carry a big stick—and most importantly, pay attention to politics. The future is in your generation’s hands, and my generation is relying on you.”

Congrats to Shannon!  She is an inspiration!  She inspired me to go back to school!  So proud of her!

Sweden native, Ida Ynner Lagerqvist, came to Post as an accredited and talented soccer player, but left as a well-rounded, passionate journalist who hopes to one day leave her footprint in the world of journalism.
Upon graduating from high school, Ynner Lagerqvist was faced with an important decision: to stay in Sweden and choose either soccer or an education or leave her family and home and come to the United States where she could pursue both an athletic and academic career.
Post’s former women’s soccer coach Mark Dawson saw Ida’s soccer highlight tape, reached out, and Ida then realized that Post was the perfect opportunity for her to earn a degree while furthering her athletic career.
“I had never been to the US before, but New York is something you always dream of. Long Island was the perfect mix of being close to the city, but also being on the outside of the city,” she said. “It seemed like the perfect kind of environment for me to go to.”
Ynner Lagerqvist played soccer at LIU Post, wearing the green and yellow Pioneer jersey for two years. Within those two years, she saw action in 20 games, including five starts in her sophomore season. During her sophomore campaign, Ynner Lagerqvist was honored as the East Coast Conference’s Elite 19 award winner, an award given to the student-athlete with the highest cumulative GPA within the conference. However, her soccer career at Post was cut short due to the merge with LIU Brooklyn, which she says was “really hard” but she learned to deal with it.
Even though soccer was taken away from her coming into her junior year, she had other passions to fall back on, including writing for the school newspaper.
Ynner Lagerqvist joined the school paper her freshman year when a professor urged her to attend a meeting.
“And then I was stuck,” she said as she reminisced on her very first newspaper meeting in 2017.
She said the Pioneer newspaper is a great place for students to have a voice and a club she was very proud to be included in.
From starting with simply taking photos for the school paper, Ynner Lagerqvist finishes her senior year as the paper’s sports editor and a very respected journalist amongst her peers.
Freshman sports management major Andrew Scarpaci had the opportunity to work alongside Ynner Lagerqvist in his role as the newspaper’s assistant sports editor. He said that working with Ida throughout his first year as a part of the Pioneer has been such an amazing experience.
“She has always made sure I was improving with each article I wrote,” Scarpaci said. “I definitely would not be at the level I’m at if it wasn’t for Ida’s help over this past year.”
As Scarpaci prepares to take over Ynner Lagerqvist position as the sports editor next year, he said that without her, he would not be ready to take on this role and help lead the next group of writers within the Pioneer.
Ynner Lagerqvist does not have her entire life after college completely mapped out yet, but she does have a great place to start as she has accepted a job as a reporter at a local radio station in Sweden.
Moving forward, she hopes to continue to move up in the industry and obtain a job with a major Swedish television network.
“We have two big morning shows in Sweden and my dream job is to work for one of them as a reporter,” she said.
With her college experience coming to an end, Ida has her future packed with exciting plans within the journalism industry. However, she is definitely sad about the ending to a great collegiate career and it’s abrupt ending due to the CO-VID 19 pandemic. She looks forward to her next visit to the states and properly saying her goodbyes to all the friends she has made throughout the past three years.
“I was not prepared to leave America this soon, but everything will work out in the end,” she said.

TikTok is a free social media app that lets you watch, create, and share videos. Often to a soundtrack of the top hits in music right from your phone.
Trends begin to form and start to become things students want to try. Making new dances to songs that become a part of the trend, like “Renegade,” “Cannibal,” “Say So,” “Hit Every Beat,” “Hey Boy,” and “Rule the World.”
Maddie Leitner, an undeclared sophomore, has her own TikTok account and uses it as a fun way to create funny videos with her friends. She makes a lot of her videos with her roommate, Samantha Bell. “It’s so fun to learn these dances and try them out or make it our own,” Leitner said. She originally created the account as a joke but she now wants to become TikTok famous.
A new trend that has emerged on the platform is creating whipped coffee. Whipped coffee is made by combining instant coffee, water and sugar in a glass filled with ice and milk. Michaela Zabicki, a sophomore sports management major, made herself whipped coffee. “It wasn’t what I expected, I also don’t like coffee that much but I wanted to see what the hype was,” Zabicki said.
Lindsey Spindel, a sophomore health sciences major, makes dances and funny videos with her roommate Emily Cahill and other friends. “This video wasn’t supposed to blow up, we were just doing it for fun, I didn’t know a lot of people would see it,” Lindsey said. Lindsey and Emily made a video of them in sweatshirts and dancing to a funny song “Wow You Can Really Dance.”
Some students have found that TikTok can be a fun way to spend time with siblings. Nicholene Silipino, a sophomore business major, made a TikTok with her two brothers and had a lot of fun making it. “There is nothing to do really, so my brothers and I just made a TikTok for fun, it’s just for entertainment,” she said.

Alexandra Ferragamo is a fifth-year senior, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in broadcasting. As graduation nears during these difficult times due to the pandemic, she reflected on her college years.
“My experience was surely memorable. I had my ups, my downs and everything in between,” Ferragamo said. “I was finally living on my own, and I truly believe that if I hadn’t dormed I would not have had the growth that I did as a person.”
Ferragamo was drawn to LIU due to the musical theatre program, which was her declared major upon committing to the school. She said it was an “up and coming program” that she had to be a part of.
Ferragamo experienced difficulties early on as a musical theatre major. She’s been singing, acting and dancing for as long as she can remember, and still does, but later decided that theatre would not provide her with a solid career, so she decided to change her major.
“I decided to switch to broadcasting because I have always loved performing, and I could still do that, just in a different way,” Ferragamo said. “I also was extremely interested in editing, which I knew nothing about at the time.”
After her switch to broadcasting, Ferragamo loved spending her time at the school’s studios and editing rooms.
“Most of my time on campus was spent in the gardens, at the radio station, at the TV station,” Ferragamo said. “This is where my [school] family was and that’s where I wanted to be.”
Ferragamo started writing for the Pioneer in the spring of 2020 and has loved the experience.
“I have always loved writing. My parents distilled that love in me as a young child, so I jumped at the chance to participate in any sort of writing,” she said. “Writing for The Pioneer is something that I wish I had become a part of before my last semester. It’s not only fun, but everyone there makes it feel so friendly and open.”
Ferragamo is very optimistic about everything the world has to offer upon graduation.
“As far as life after graduation goes, I’m excited to go out into the world and work hard, learn, and hustle as I try to find my place,” Ferragamo said.

Nick Mattina is a senior broadcasting major, who became a very close friend of Ferragamo’s over the past few years. Some qualities Mattina admires about Ferragamo is that she’s very kind, a hard worker and overall, “she’s a great person.” 
They have been working together at the radio station together for quite some time now, and Mattina has had nothing but great experiences with Ferragamo.
“It’s been great working with Ali for the past 4 years,” Mattina said. “She is dedicated to whatever she is working on and I admire that.”
Mattina believes Ferragamo has added so much to the culture of the radio station and the university overall.
“She always brightens a room up, whether it be the radio station or a classroom,” he said.

President Donald J. Trump signed a $2 trillion deal to send direct payments to individuals and businesses while the economy is at a standstill due to COVID-19. College students between the ages of 17 to 24, claimed by their parents or claiming themselves, were ineligible to benefit from the president’s care package.
With stay-at-home orders in place, a large number of jobs suitable for college students like retail, food service and fitness, belong to industries largely affected by the virus. Some have lost their jobs or were furloughed for the time being.
Students who participated in work study programs have lost a source of income as well. Though the university decided to keep resident halls open, the rest of campus is closed and some students returned home.
William Jahn, freshman acting major, drove from Tennessee to New York, packed his entire dorm, and immediately drove back to Tennessee, all within a 48-hour time span. He was really looking forward to receiving a check
“I also lost my entire income. It’s hard to make money, especially at this time, and the stimulus package would really help,” he said. “I was expecting one and was extremely upset when I saw most college students don’t qualify.”
According to Forbes, “The package is the biggest economic rescue package in modern American history.” But even if a college student’s parents do not claim them as a dependent, they are still not eligible for a stimulus payment.
Stimulus checks are payments sent to eligible American citizens who are claimed as an independent on their own tax return, or as a dependent on someone else’s tax return. Americans began receiving one-time payments from the Internal Revenue Service in the middle of April.
People who make $75,000 or less per tax year are eligible for a $1,200 check with an additional $500 for each qualifying dependent. Many people from the ages 17 to 24 do not qualify for a stimulus payment. If the student does not live in the home for more than half the year they do qualify, but temporary absences for education count as though the student is still living in the home, according to Forbes.
A junior student who worked two jobs on campus and preferred to remain anonymous, worked over 30 hours a week without the school knowing. They said: “I have to pay for basically everything all on my own. My two jobs were my only source of income and now I have nothing. My parents filed me as dependent and now I don’t get any money. That money would have helped make up the payment for my tuition. I am so unbelievably upset by this. My friends, and I’m sure hundreds of other college students, don’t feel seen whatsoever by the government and President Trump.”

President Donald J. Trump released a three-phase approach on April 7 for state governors to implement and follow as they gradually lift stay-at-home orders and reinstate to a new normal in areas where COVID-19 cases are decreasing and ample testing is available.
Returning to regular activities will be a long process, and to prevent another outbreak of the disease, social-distancing measures could be in place until the end of the year, according to federal health officials.
Joseph Campisi, a sophomore biology major, said that while the economy needs to reopen ASAP, it’s important that people continue to take precaution.
The social-distancing measures are essential because people are still ignoring it, and if they continue to do so it’s just going to be extended even more,” he said.
Trump, although reluctant to do so, made it clear that state governors are responsible for carrying out the three-phase plan as they see fit and in accordance with data collected within their states.
Once a state obtains a steady decline of infection, along with enough equipment to carry out ample testing, phase one can begin. This phase continues the strict social-distancing measures while in public, avoidance of unnecessary travel, and gatherings of more than 10 individuals all remain discouraged.
Alexandria Price, a sophomore business major, is almost certain that finding a job will be tough once the pandemic measures are lifted.
“Once this lockdown ends, l think the economy will be really fragile, and won’t be normal again until a minimum of two years,” she said.
Social-distancing is further recommended in phase two, but travel can recommence and social gatherings of no more than 50 are encouraged unless precautionary steps are taken.
Breanna Boyce, a junior fashion merchandising major, said “l think the economy is going to be really hurt once everything slowly starts to open, and will take a while to recover from this virus.”
Phase three includes a return to business as usual, with the focus being on monitoring, identifying and quarantining new cases.
“I’m not too worried about how the economy will be when it reopens,” Lauren Ramierz, a junior accounting major, said. “l think the federal government will do what they have to in order to make sure our economy is fine, unlike other countries that have just overproduced money in times of recession.”
According to Federal Net Network, the plan suggested that states should pass benchmarks that look at incidents of new cases, testing and surveillance data collected over the previous 14 days before moving to the next phase. Each state will move at their own speed, and implementation of the plan will be dependent on if the state is decreasing its cases and has strong testing.
Larissa Caluori, a junior radiology major, said the level of unemployment is a signal that the country is in trouble monetarily.
“I’m going to guess the economy won’t be doing so well because nobody is buying things because they’re not getting paid, so there’s not much money circulation going on,” she said. “Over 10 million applied for unemployment in March following the closure of the economy… it will take a long time for the economy to recover from this.”

All graduating seniors received an email on Friday, April 10, signed by Matthew Blanar, director of student affairs, explaining how commencement will play out.
“The culmination of years of hard work has arrived. The Commencement Ceremony for the Class of 2020 at Long Island University will take place on Wednesday, May 20 at 10 a.m.,” the email stated.
The email further explained how seniors can order a cap and gown. It also revealed how each student will be recognized by a “personalized graduation slide” at commencement.
Jules Rivera, a senior acting major, is disappointed about the decision to make graduation a virtual ceremony, explaining that it denies her the reward to walk at commencement, and that the end will not justify the means.
“The idea of having a virtual ceremony is truthfully a slap in the face,” she said. “I’m now thousands of dollars in debt and don’t have a ceremony to look forward to.”
Rivera went on about all of her hardships while living on campus, including two mice in her room and “subpar” facilities. She said the only reason she deals with it is because of the theatre program.
Each student can purchase regalia online. Prices range from $80 to $190, excluding shipping and handling, and depending on what degree a student is graduating with. Cap and gowns will be shipped directly to a student’s home. If a student reserved a set before the switch, they will need to complete a new form to finalize orders.
Victoria Rousseau, a senior musical theatre major, said she refuses to purchase an $80 cap and gown for a ceremony, which to some, is nonexistent. Instead, she bought a cap and gown on Amazon in a color that she actually likes.
The ceremony, now scheduled for May 20, is planned to be on a virtual interactive platform. During the commencement, there will be remarks, distinguished speakers and slides of graduating students. Each senior will have a customized slide including their name, major and degree. Before graduation, students are asked to add a photo, custom text and the proper pronunciation of their name. During or after the ceremony, students will be able to download and share their personal slides on social media.
Rousseau said the virtual ceremony is ridiculous, and that a slideshow is a complete disrespect to the entire graduating class.
“They could have just postponed it to the fall. Nobody is okay with this. A customized slide? Seriously, that is not recognition at all,” she said. “I’m a first generation grad and all I have to show for it is a piece of paper that they will mail to me and two seconds of a powerpoint. It’s a joke.”
Rivera agreed, emphasizing that a personalized slide is certainly not $75,000 worth [of tuition costs].
“Obviously my money isn’t going towards the facilities, so where is it going?” she said.
The email also informed seniors about a virtual invitation to the commencement ceremony, which students are encouraged to share with their families and friends, with a link to livestream the event. In order for family and friends to receive a personal invite from the school, students must complete a form which can be found at https://liu.edu/commencement/student-information#slides.
Digital copies of the official commencement program will be sent to each student. If desired, a hard copy can also be sent to a student’s home upon request. The program will include a schedule of events, names of all graduates and a list of honors and recognitions.
For the remainder of the year, senior events will take place on Zoom, to which students can expect invitations to via email. The events were created to celebrate senior’s accomplishments with their class. Pre-registration is not required.
Rousseau received some emails thus far regarding the senior events, but deleted them rather than reading them.
“It’s not in my interest to cater to them at all,” she said. “They won’t give me even an inch of respect, why should I participate in these pathetic senior events? We don’t want them, we want a graduation.”

It’s surreal that the day has finally come where I am writing my final piece for the Pioneer. My time working on this publication has been the highlight of my collegiate career, and I’m both heartened and saddened to bid it farewell.
To all the dedicated staff members with their stellar reporting skills and passion for the truth, I thank you for your phenomenal work over the time I’ve known you. I have complete faith in the next generation of Pioneer editors, and I’m excited to see how they excel as they move up to bigger and better opportunities.
The Pioneer staff of spring 2020 deserves a bit of special recognition; journalism is a constantly evolving field, so an adaptable reporter is invaluable. Amidst campus closures, social-distancing and a global pandemic, our outstanding staff members stuck through any and all challenges COVID-19 threw their way.
Initially, I was heartbroken that we wouldn’t be able to print our paper anymore in the middle of the semester, but thanks to the determined team of reporters that uphold this publication, the Pioneer went completely digital, uploading new top-quality stories every single week. I can’t properly express how proud I am that we all persevered until the very end.
It was in the Pioneer newsroom where I recognized my passion for reporting, and I’d never have stepped foot inside there had it not been for the encouragement of Professor Carolyn Levin, who formerly advised the paper. She, along with all the previous staff members who showed me the ropes, trained me to be the journalist I am today. I never would have imagined an acting major would become Co-Editor-in-Chief of her college newspaper, and love every second of it, even when the going got tough.
I have nothing but love in my heart for the Pioneer and the friends I’ve made through it. I’ve learned a lot about who I am and what I can do, and I feel ready to dive into the next steps I’m to take as a journalist in the professional world.
To our readers, thank you for your continued support, and please continue striving to be well-informed individuals.
Yours truly,
Ashley Bowden
Co-Editor-in-Chief

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced new recommendations that encourage the use of face masks while in public on April 3. In response, some people have started to create and buy their own customized masks as a means of self-expression through fashion.
Wearing face masks as a fashion statement is not a new trend. In Asian countries including South Korea for example, wearing a mask before heading out is an everyday occurrence for some, whether out of fashion or necessity. In American culture, celebrities and street style influencers like Billie Eilish have worn luxury brand face masks as accessories.
Face masks have emerged in luxury fashion such as Gucci and Fendi. Within the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people are wearing face masks on a daily basis, so several people found the need for a more stylish option. Jaime Ross, adjunct professor of sustainability in fashion and business of fashion, said this trend is to be expected.
“Trends are often a reflection or manifestation of society, yet often grow out of a very basic need,” she said.
However, this fast-spreading fashion trend could be seen as encouragement to disregard social distancing. While face masks reduce the risk of spread of infection, they do not completely protect people from the contagious virus.
“The fabrics may not be up to the requirements, they don’t feature filters. They are most likely intended for a walk down the street rather than frontline duty,” Ross said.
Some students have recognized the emergence of this new fashion trend. “Especially in the last few years, this is the first time face masks have really been a trend,” Caroline Person, a freshman fashion merchandising major, said.
Ross saw the trend begin two years ago in Paris. “I started to see them from some Paris-based makers at Premiere Classe, the accessories show in Paris in 2018. Attendees were already wearing whimsical ones with cat whiskers, funny faces, flames, metal studs. Now they are all over the internet,” Ross said.
Cassandra Cerbone, a freshman fashion merchandising major, saw the trend arise and initially didn’t see a point to it, but she has since changed her mind.
“Around two months before the COVID outbreak, I saw people wear masks as a trend, they would match them with their outfits. But now, it is a safety measure that people are taking to protect themselves from the virus,” she said.
COVID-19 has taken a toll on the fashion industry by shutting down several businesses and postponing many international fashion weeks and trade shows. This has given brands the opportunity to reopen and support charitable causes. Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Burberry have focused their businesses on making and donating face masks to those on the frontlines of the pandemic. Smaller brands such as Los Angeles Apparel are selling face masks for consumer use at $30 apiece. The trend of designing customized masks has spread to shop sellers on Etsy.com as well, according to Cerbone.
Students have also pitched in to help out; Cerbone, who is working with Amuze, a luxury fashion company, has helped make masks out of dust bags for healthcare workers.
“I’m making them myself, but so many people are making them as well,” she said. “The company has 40,000 dust bags in its warehouse.”
Cerbone’s mom works in healthcare and has made masks for herself and her associates out of fabric they had at home.
This pandemic marks another point in history where elements of fashion have been used for protection.
“From cave times and animal pelts, to metal armor to NASA suits to football helmets, fashion has often served a protective function, be it from elements or physical threats,” Ross said. “Recently it has really come to the forefront as people feel more uncertain via global warming, politics and threats from other countries.”
“I think in today’s day and age, fashion as protection is more prevalent,” Person said. Wearing a face mask today can be seen as more than just an accessory, and it has become a symbol of safety and the current culture of the world.

COVID-19 has changed the way fine and performing arts students are spending their senior year, and nationwide contact restrictions have impacted their next steps after graduation into industries that have been put onhold.
Michaela Fox, a senior musical theatre major, said the new coronavirus has taken a toll on her industry.
“Theatre requires human interaction, it is dependent on having people to receive and respond to your work and to remain present and vulnerable with,” Fox said.
The virus has shut down the theatre industry in several ways, including Broadway and regional theaters closing until further notice.
“Many of my classmates and I were depending on [those theaters] for summer work, but it has taken away a crucial element of theatre that even when we attempt to make it virtually, it simply is not the same,” Fox said.
Sky Hicks, a senior musical theatre major, agreed with Fox because people are focused on larger issues.
“Broadway is shut down until June right now, and live theatre isn’t exactly something folks are jumping at the bit to go see right now,” he said.
The last semester of college for performance seniors would normally consist of a senior showcase, in which the students perform in front of agents in the city. This gives them the opportunity to get signed with an agency and start their careers. However, this event was cancelled for the spring 202o semester.
“I was supposed to act in the senior showcase, and the hope was to potentially sign with an agent,” Fox said.
Normally the next steps after graduation for performing arts students is to find what platform will work best for that artist.
“For the few who participate in the senior showcase … they contract with agents or managers and try to tackle the New York theatre scene,” Fox said. “There are even some who try their hand at the commercial theatre without the agents, and as long as they work hard and understand themselves and the industry, they can be successful.”
Some actors move forward to find work in regional or repertoire theatres, or film, television or voice acting roles.
Under stay-at-home orders, everything has shifted to virtual and self-taping, according to Fox. On a positive note, she found several ways to stay productive.
“I have completed my website, recorded and produced an original song, began publishing my book, and have recorded and edited five self-tapes,” Fox said.
Because Hicks had to move home, he is unable to take any of the next steps in his hometown of Columbus, O.H.
“Plans have changed because I’m now in the middle of Ohio trying to ride this out with my folks. I can’t exactly go looking for apartments and roommates in New York right now, nor can I make any solid plans in regards to employment because nobody knows what’s going to happen tomorrow, much less a few months from now,” he said.
While taking their next steps after graduation can be challenging for seniors, so is the loss of graduation and their last semester in college.
“It just sucks how everything is going down right now. We’re missing out on huge moments in our lives,” Hicks said. “I’m a first-generation college graduate, and this was going to be one of the most important days in my life for my family. I don’t get to have that same experience now,” Hicks said.
Fox agreed, however she wants seniors to focus on the positive aspects of life and stay united through a troubling time.
“Not having a senior week, not having a formal, not having a traditional graduation ceremony is difficult. Not having each other is difficult,” Fox said. “But we stay united, we trust this timing, and we understand that our love and our friendship will transcend this … that first moment the world can see each other again. I have hope that we will be a better world.”

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, several arts students had trouble completing their projects. However, they found a way to cope with their new circumstances.
Caroline Bert, a graduate photography student, has tried her best to keep busy. Due to social distancing regulations, she is not allowed into her studio where she normally works, so this led her to start new projects. By doing so, Bert had to leave the works that she had previously started in her studio behind.
One new challenge Bert undertook was embroidery and how to incorporate it into her photography. Bert said that her art has been a positive coping mechanism for her during the pandemic, especially as a way to ease her worries concerning her mother. Bert’s mother is a nurse and is on the front-lines of COVID-19. To help with this, she has also been spending time with family and loved ones when she is not learning about new embroidery techniques.
“I miss my studio and my darkroom, but I know I will be back as soon as this is all over,” Bert said.
Wenkai Ji, a graduate photography student from China, said that he warned his professors that America should prepare for this pandemic, but no one agreed with him until it was too late. Ji was lucky enough to get 50 pounds of clay before BLICK, an art materials store, closed. His main artworks include photography, ceramics, and pottery.
“Professor Frank Olt said as an artist, ‘you have to make work at least three hours per day,’” Ji said.
Following his professor’s advice, Ji started making tea cups and plates at home. He has taken on building pottery by hand due to his lack of a pottery wheel at home. He would normally have access to one on campus in the ceramics studio.
“It is quite a good time for me, I like quiet and totally focus on the pottery 100 percent,” Ji said. “I can give myself deep thinking for my work and also my life.”
Because he wants to avoid going outside, Ji has also taken up cooking as a way to spend time with his family. Ji also said that he has found working at home to be no different from working on campus. The only frustration he encounters is the occasional feeling of loneliness.
Grace Pentecoste, a mixed media graduate student, said that working on her art has always been a coping mechanism for her, even long before the nationwide shutdown. She explained that before the pandemic, her days did not stop from the moment she woke up to the moment she went to bed.
The stay-at-home order has changed several aspects of Pentecoste’s life.
“I am a full-time art teacher in a high school, I work part time at a college, and go to graduate school full time at Post,” she said.
Her busy schedule has moved online, so she makes a point to stay active.
“I force myself outside no matter the weather because it is healthy for me to do so and keeps me sane. I need to breathe, stretch and clear my head,” she said.
Pentecoste makes sure to take her camera outdoors with her.
Pentecoste said that her biggest frustration is not having a hands-on connection.
“I enjoy physically manipulating my images, whether that means to bring them into the darkroom, transfer it onto paper or a found object, [or] making it into an engraving, and the quarantine doesn’t give me that option,” she said.
Instead, Pentecoste has taken her images and manipulated them with photoshop to look antique.
The beginning of self-isolation was challenging for Pentecoste because she lost her ability to continue creating solar plates and printing like she usually would do in the sculpture studio. She took up sketching dried out flowers and painting. Pentecoste also started gathering materials from her backyard and photographing them. Afterwards, she prints the photos out and does gesso transfers onto water-colored paper. Gesso transferring is a way of displaying an image on an alternate surface.
With the widened spread of COVID-19, Pentecoste relocated to a remote area and now spends lots of her time driving around, exploring unknown territory and taking photographs as she goes.

Newfound homebodies have discovered a love for crafts they never knew they had before self-isolating for a month, or even longer in some cases. People around the country are in search of new hobbies to fill the long days inside.
College students have discovered what may be a generational interest in crafts. Social media has helped college students to share D.I.Y ideas, and people have put their own twists on classic art.
“I get my ideas from existing drawings but interpret my own creativity to it,” Isabella Whelan, a freshman psychology major, said.
Being locked indoors for weeks on end has forced some people into a drive to create newthings.
“Some crafts I’ve started to take up the time are embroidery, doodling, and I just ordered a paint set to try painting out.” Sophia Chianese, a junior accounting major, said. “I think so far embroidery is my favorite. It’s more time-consuming than drawing or painting, but it gives me the ability to create something I can wear in my daily life.”
The idea of practicing different types of crafts has been helpful for those who remain inside. Not only does it help people discover hobbies, but is a silver lining that helps them fill the time.
“Through crafting in quarantine, I have definitely been able to explore new interests since I have so much time on my hands. I do draw on a frequent basis but I don’t think I would’ve ever thought to embroider any of my things before this,” Chianese said.
In addition to that, crafts act as a bridge between family members looking to spend time together during this time.
“My mom is a crafter and lately has been coming up with ideas to keep us busy when we’re not binge-watching Netflix together. We made earrings, we built a new garden planter, and we re-painted and re-touched some murals in our house,” Juliana Veraldi, a junior film major, said. Instead of sitting silently on the couch, family members can create pieces of art to pass the time and bond.
While art classes and group projects can be fun, doing crafts from home requires no specific talent and comes with endless possibilities.
“Drawing is fun for everyone, even if you can only do stick figures. It’s a skill, therapeutic, and a fun activity that can last a lifetime,” Whelan said.
Although isolated during this time, sharing creative ideas with friends is a great way to find new inspiration and keep in touch over the lonely weeks.
“It’s nice to have so many friends from home who are also so creative and to bounce ideas off of,” Chianese said.
Art is for everyone and can be made from anything. “It’s super easy to print out a page or two of a flower or fish or a design to color in, and it’s a mess free, ‘no clean-up time’ way to pass the time,” Veraldi said.
Crafts or inspiration can be found anywhere, especially on the internet, during a time where everyone is exploring ways to fill the time.
