The C.W. Post women’s field hockey team saw their season come to a close this past Saturday in Pennsylvania.
The Pioneers walked away from their matchup against defending Division II National Champion Bloomsburg University with a 4-0 loss, dropping their record to 9-10 while boosting the Huskies’ to an impressive 16-2.
This past week C.W. Post was dropped from national ranking, but was able to hold the Bloomsburg team off the scoreboard for the first 20 minutes of action. However, Bloomsburg junior Amanda Riley ignited the Huskies’ offensive assault at the 24:02 mark. Just over 30 seconds later, Bloomsburg scored another goal, discouraging the Pioneers’ spirit. Another Bloomsburg goal resulted in a 3-0 deficit for the Pioneers going into the half.
The Pioneers had a much more competitive second half, conceding only one additional goal to the third-ranked Huskies. The Pioneers had two opportunities in the second half to prevent the shutout with shots from freshman midfielder Carlee Dragon and junior defender Helene Brunker, but Post was unable to find the back of the net before time ran out.
The Pioneers will not advance to the playoffs for the third year in a row, tallying their second season below .500 in two years. The team will look to do some major rebuilding this off-season, as they will lose six seniors in the spring.

The 2010 C.W. Post Men’s soccer team finished with a record of 7-8-2 (4-3), which qualified them to reach the East Coast Conference Championships. In the championships, Post squared off against a tough Dowling squad and lost a heartbreaker via penalty kicks.
“A loss is a loss,” said senior forward Rumen Kerekov.  “Although the game was even, there was a disappointment from the loss.  Shootout is gambling and unfortunately we were on the losing side.”
To start off the 2010 campaign, the Pioneers got off to a rocky start losing three of their first four games. However, the Pioneers quickly rebounded to a 4-4-1 record, as they later won three games in a row, and won their first two conference match-ups versus the New York Institute of Technology and the University of Bridgeport.
Next on the schedule was the eventual-champion Dowling Golden Lions. Post ended up falling to Dowling 2-1 in a fierce battle of conference rivals.
“The first game against Dowling was the turning point of the season,” mentioned Kerekov. “We should have won it in order to keep our chances for NCAA. But we lost and our mentality went down. Although after that game we had some outstanding games, we did not manage to achieve the consistency we needed.”
There was definitely a lack of consistency as Post lost four of their final seven games of the season, but yet there was still an opportunity to make it into the ECC Championships. All the Pioneers had to do was win against inner-conference Queens College.
“My favorite moment of the season was when we defeated Queens at home,” said Kerekov. “This was a decisive game and we had to win it in order to qualify for the playoffs. Fortunately, we played great and beat them 2-0.”
After the victory against Queens, Post went up against Dowling in the ECC Championships, but came up short. “The team played well at times,” explained Kerekov. “The problem was that in the most important games we made crucial mistakes that caused our losses.”
In addition, throughout the year, the Pioneers were forced to deal with several key injuries to their squad. Even sophomore back Leron Haywood missed a majority of the year as he only appeared in three games. Haywood was last year’s MVP in the ECC Tournament.
The loss to Dowling was the last time the group of players would all be on the field at the same time. Notable players leaving the team this year are Captain Ed Shone, Emanuel Messina, and Kerekov.
“I will miss playing soccer with the team,” said Kerekov who scored five goals and totaled twelve points for the season. “Although I came to the team this season, I feel very attached to the guys and to the team as a whole.  I wish the guys good luck next year! They can definitely make the NCAA.”
The men’s soccer team has promise for next season as two players were selected to the East Coast Conference first team. Freshman back Joakim Ohlson and junior midfielder David Carlsson both earned spots on the All-Conference Team. Ohlson had six goals and distributed three assists, and Carlsson scored four goals and dished out two assists.

The C.W. Post Women’s soccer team is on their way to the third round of the 2010 NCAA Division II Women’s Soccer Championships after defeating the American International College (AIC) Yellow Jackets on Sunday.
The lady Pioneers continued their on-field domination by shutting AIC out 2-0. During the first half the lady Pioneers put the pressure on AIC goalkeeper Kara Potts, but could not find the back of the net.
The second half featured the same story even though Post had several opportunities but failed to capitalize. Tove Eriksson hit the crossbar on a penalty shot and Karina Rizzo got robbed of a goal by AIC defender Jenifer Kirby as she made a defensive save on what would have been a sure goal early in the second half. The Pioneers finally ended the scoring drought 70:09 in the second half as freshman forward Alexa Niciforo put a shot into the lower left corner to give Post a 1-0 lead. Six minutes later Niciforo struck again sealing the victory for the lady Pioneers by the score of 2-0.
The lady Pioneers will now face one of their toughest foes yet, the Saint Rose Golden Knights (22-0). The Golden Knights are given the #1 spot by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) and out-rank C.W Post in Win-Loss percentage (Ranked 1st), goals per game (Ranked 2nd), save percentage (Ranked 2nd), Shutout percentage (Ranked 5th) and goals-against-average (Ranked 2nd). In comparison C.W. Post is ranked 13th, 18th, 20th, 6th, 13th, and 10th respectively in the same categories.
The Golden Knights come into the contest having shut out each of their four teams throughout their current postseason run. They have also held 10 of their last 12 opponents scoreless, including six straight, and in the process have lowered their team goals-against-average to 0.27 on the year.
C.W. Post and Saint Rose will battle on Friday, November 19 at Westchester University. The winner will go on to the quarterfinals to take on the winner of West Chester University and California (PA).

The 2010 C.W. Post Turkey Trot was a huge success yet again for the 9th straight year.
Athletes, staff members, students, and walkers all participated in the five-kilometer race in which they all donated non-perishable foods for families in need for the upcoming holiday.
“The programs been growing a little bit each year,” said Martin Guillet, Fitness Director, and Associate Director of Recreational Sports. “We had a turnout of about 230 participants in total.”
Winners of each race originally used to win a free turkey, but after an incident with some bad turkey, the award was changed to Pathmark gift cards. A gift card is given to a member of each category that comes in first place. The categories are best male athlete, female athlete, staff member, regular student, and walker
The winner of this year’s Turkey Trot for the male students was Gavin Davila, with a time of 20:47.84. Davila impressively finished first overall for the entire race, and is not a student athlete.
The winner for best female athlete was junior Lauren Spagnoletta with a time of 23:32.68. “I didn’t really prepare that much for it,” said Spagnoletta, a member of the women’s lacrosse team. “I kind of just ran it.”  This was her third time competing in the trot, placing ninth overall.
The best time for a male athlete was Glen Hudson with a time of 22:07.58.  Fernando Mendoza had the best time for members of the staff, and came in 2nd overall in the race, with a time of 21:06.22.
The tradition of the C.W. Post Turkey Trot was successful and competitive for all participants. But more importantly, it is for an excellent cause as it raises food for needy families.  It is also in light of the season, since Thanksgiving is just a week away.

A thrilling 42-38 win over Slippery Rock put a bow on an exciting season of Pioneers football. Even at 7-4, the Pioneers fell short of the playoffs and will ride into the off-season as spectators again. But with any season come the end-of-season awards, the best players and moments from the 2010 football season.
C.W. Post’s team MVP is not the most obvious player, but he did make the biggest positive impact of the season. Senior Ken Reid started the year as the starting tight end but moved to left tackle mid-year due to injuries. Reid did an excellent job of protecting quarterback Eric Anderwkavich’s blind side and displayed a great deal of class by switching positions. Moving from one spot to another is never easy, but Reid made the seamless transition and was selfless enough to do it in the first place.
The Offensive Player of the Year is wide receiver Darnel Williams. With 963 yards and 12 touchdowns on the year, Williams proved to be one of the best receivers in the PSAC. Spectacular plays aside, there were countless times where Williams would make a clutch reception to keep a drive going. He made the most catches and is tied for the most touchdown receptions in the PSAC.
On the defensive side, the player of the year is junior linebacker Billy O’Connor. O’Connor is a player that is in on every play, hustling to the ball and always giving 100 percent. He finished the year as the PSAC’s leading tackler with 125 stops.
The Most Improved Player award has to go to linebacker Ronnie Modik. He displayed a noticeable improvement from Game 1 to the final whistle in week 11. He did not begin the year as a starter, but injuries to the team combined with hard work moved Modik into the starting lineup and he never looked back. He became an omnipresent defensive force and even recorded the game-sealing interception in the season’s final game against Slippery Rock, where he recorded 20 tackles earning him PSAC Defensive Player of the Week; however, he shares this honor with Kutztown’s Alex DiNolfi.
The Freshman of the Year award is split between two players. Halfback Anthony Brunetti stepped in as Post’s feature back in the absence of the injured Thomas Beverly. Brunetti’s best performance was his 4 touchdown game against Cheyney. Wide Receiver Joe Botti provided a viable option opposite Darnel Williams in the passing game. His break out game was his 227-yard, 2 touchdown game against Kutztown.
The Senior of the Year has to go to quarterback Eric Anderwkavich. He fought through ankle and rib injuries and a slow start to become an efficient player for Post. He finished with 2,605 passing yards and 28 touchdowns. He was also the team’s leading rusher with 769 yards.

The women’s swimming team lost its first meet to Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) this past Saturday.  The Pioneers fell behind with a final score of 138-152.
“It was tough because we are a small team compared to them,” said Sandra Kirstein, the C.W. Post sophomore. Despite having only 10 swimmers, the lady Pioneers walked away with nine first-place finishes. 
The 200 Medley Relay beat out four separate SCSU Owl teams with a time of 1:49:55.  This relay team consisted of freshmen Mathilde Hyddmark and Tamara Garriock, sophomore Cornelia Hanes, and senior Riley Cassidy.
Another relay win came from the 200 free-style team; with Kirstein, Hanes and Garriock and sophomore Mairi Morrison.  They out swam the Owls with a time of 1:40:18.
There were also multiple double wins for some of the women swimmers. Garriock, who is new to the team from Duncan, Canada, won the 100 and 200 breaststroke.  Also, sophomore Cornelia Hanes (Stockholm, Sweden) won the 50 and 100 free-style events with times of 24.8 and 54.32.
The Owls also have a diving team, which contributed to the points to give SCSU a win.  With no Post diving team, this was a tough hurdle for the lady Pioneers to get over.  “We swam better than them,” Kirstein said. “It’s too bad they had a diving team.”
But the women’s swim team looks forward to their meet this Friday, November 19th.  They will travel to Army for a 7 p.m. start time.

As reported in the Pioneer on October 27, the Jericho Water District guaranteed that it is supplying the C.W. Post campus with the best water.  It said it would be even better than bottled water.
So, the Pioneer decided to test the truth of that promise.  After holding a taste test during the common hour in Hillwood Commons, there were some contradicting results. There were more votes for bottled water than Post’s drinking water. Out of the 11 students who volunteered for the water tasting, only two of them preferred Post’s drinking water. The rest of the students preferred the Poland Spring bottled water.
The voting was done anonymously.  There were two cups, one that was placed on a red circle and the other on a blue circle, that had the two different water samples. After they had put in their color vote, the results were then revealed.
All of the students detected a difference between both waters. Most of them voted for the blue circle, which represented for Poland Spring water. Unexpectedly, temperature mattered within their vote. Most of the students found the bottled water to be colder than C.W. Post drinking water and said this factor could have affected their vote.
“I was surprised by the outcome,” junior Emily Timpson said. “The drinking water was cool and refreshing. I found the Poland Spring water to be tingy and thought that was the school water.” Another student, senior Jill Scionti, said, “I do not think there was much of a difference, but the tap water tasted the same for me.”
The students had their own opinions about both waters but none had a negative comment about C.W. Post drinking water. Even though Poland Spring water was liked overall, C.W. Post drinking water was not neglected. The bottled water was just preferred.
Some students were even shocked at their own school’s tap water.  “I was surprised how good the Post water is in comparison to the bottled water,” junior Alexandra LaRocca said.
In this anonymous water test, students preferred the bottled water, but they also didn’t mind Post’s drinking water.  In this case, the Jericho Water District was incorrect with their statement. It has more to do with personal taste.  And, of course, even though students prefer the bottled water, the cheaper option is always the free Post water!

Ever hear the saying you must take the good in with the bad? For most of us, the world wide web is used on a daily basis. From ordering movie tickets to watching a quick Youtube on how to do Beyonce’s “Single Ladies” dance, it’s safe to say you can search for just about anything. But what about everything in between?  Just as you can use the Internet in a positive way, leaves an even greater chance to use it in a negative way.  The web is filled with portals of dissenting sites.  One in particular is Pro-Ana, which is a self-hate site used to influence anorexia to young teens.
Pro-Ana, stands for Pro-anorexia, and means the promotion of eating disorders. These namesake websites are created by those who suffer from eating disorders and are used to communicate with others affected. The websites hold tips on how to be anorexic and bulimic. The tips include hiding weight loss from your parents and friends, how to lose weight quickly, and how to suppress being hungry all the time. The websites often include pictures of models and celebrities who are very thin. This is called “thinspiration,” which circles around thinking “thin” all the time.
Throughout the years the websites followers have grown.  Oprah Winfrey featured a show on these websites and spoke out to major search engines to shut them down. Most have, but websites like MySpace, Facebook, and Xanga still hold the Pro-ana groups and its followers.
Some Pro-Ana websites are not all used to promote eating disorders. Some host inspiration and help from those recovering from eating disorders. The websites hold non-judgmental material and have become a place of safety for those who are suffering with an eating disorder.
“These websites can be dangerous to girls and boys especially if their self-esteem is already low to begin with, Dr. Sonya Reddy, a psychiatrist in Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park said. “I would hope that the person would be smart to get out of there and make decisions for themselves, but I hear from so many how great it feels to be understood; that others think like them as well.”
Eating disorders are very serious illnesses that effect males and females of all ages. It is possible to report these websites to large search engines and have them shut down, but it will most likely pop up again. The thing to advocate is for people to be healthy and not settle on being the thinnest person in the room. Maybe the media is to blame; it could be a lot of things. But this issue needs to be fought head-on or it will never die.

Many of us assume Twitter to be just another social networking system like Facebook and Myspace. It started as a fun way to post pictures and update one’s status with activities of their daily life, however it grew into something much more than that.  Today, students across college campuses are using Twitter to find and market themselves for jobs.
We students are constantly warned about what we put on the Internet –especially now that potential employers search the web to look for existing Twitter accounts. Instead of worrying about this and blocking everything we do, we should be using these social networks to help us. Employers are going to look at them either way, so why not use it to market ourselves appropriately?
Twitter is one of the most popular marketing devices being used today. Television shows, websites, movies, and even news programs will often tell you, “Follow us on Twitter.” If you actually like the program or product being advertised, you will most likely follow them or at least check out their site.
Career fields like journalism, television, radio, advertising and public relations are constantly using Twitter to advertise their shows and/or products and get messages across. If you are planning to get involved in any of these fields, developing a good image on Twitter and learning how to work the site appropriately is highly recommended, and can be quite an advantage.
Public Relations major Alexa DeMartino is a fan of Twitter. “Twitter is different from Facebook, you can follow people and get updates constantly and instantly,” states DeMartino. “I am constantly getting updates from specific people I follow on Twitter, and it helps me network.”
Social media has changed the way we use and even look at the Internet. It allows people to put themselves out there in ways they were never able to before. Marketing yourself on Twitter is one of those ways to take advantage of the new technology of the Internet.
It is an extremely easy networking system to get started –for the only difficult part is finding a user name that hasn’t been used yet. However after you find one that fits you, it is time to start “tweeting.” Start off by following companies, organizations, or even people who you are interested in or a job you may want to be employed with. Post pictures or tweet about clubs and projects you are involved in. You can even create more than one Twitter –a personal and a professional one. Now get out there and start TWEETING!

Receiving a master in four different subjects gives a lot of options as a teacher. The question is which subject to teach? “In political science there are many areas that relate to the other subjects I received masters in: philosophy, history, and religion. All of these subjects kind of overlap each other,” states Dr. Soupios. Dr. Soupios graduated from St. Lawrence University in 1971, with a major in History.
Everyone knows Dr. Soupios for his great reputation as a professor, but what many may not know is that he was an outstanding athlete in his college years. “I was a defensive lineman on the football team at St. Lawrence,” states Soupios. “It may not look like it now but I was 245 pounds back then. I’m about 175 now.”  Aside from being a standout football player at St. Lawrence, Dr. Soupios also competed in many long distance races around the country. “I’ve ran ten 100 mile races through the years and did many 50 mile races as well.” Dr. Soupios continues to stay active, running six days a week in the early morning on the nature trails in Sunken Meadow Park.
After graduating in 1971, Dr. Soupios immediately began his graduate work at C.W. Post, however it was not the only stop he made for graduate school. “After C.W. Post I went to Columbia, SUNY Buffalo, Fordham, and the catholic seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington.” While Dr. Soupios attended the seminary, he received a master in theology and a doctorate in religion. “It was a very rewarding time for me,” Soupios claims.
During all of this, Dr. Soupios met his wife Linda at St. Lawrence University and they have been married now for 38 years with three children. “My oldest son Nick works for the D.E.A. in Manhattan, my other son Alex is an elementary teacher in Franklin Square, and my daughter Athena is a full time mom for my three year old granddaughter Aliana.” Dr. Soupios credits his wife for helping him achieve what he has done thus far in his teaching career. “Without my wife, I would not have been able to do the things I have accomplished.”
Before Dr. Soupios became a professor here at C.W. Post, he took a position in the administration office as the Assistant Vice President of Academic Affairs in 1977. However, it wasn’t what he had in mind. “When I got here in 1977 there were no teaching jobs, and I had a family to feed so I took this position. When teaching jobs began to open up I jumped at the opportunity. Best decision I ever made.” Since 1977, Dr. Soupios has been a part of the C.W. Post family, and teaching is something that is very dear to him. “It’s rewarding for me to instruct young people, even after thirty four years its still fun.” After thirty four years, Dr. Soupios shows no signs of slowing down. “With God’s help, I can do this for a very long time. Many professors think about retirement all the time but not me. The only time I will stop teaching is when I stop loving it. Until that day comes, I will be teaching many years to come.”

Are you tired of using the same old machines and attending the same body conditioning classes at the Pratt Center? Maybe the idea of playing in the racquetball courts, the indoor jogging track and the total-body workouts seem tiring to you. There are other workouts that are just as fun and healthy to your body, that you can simply try in either your room or on the beautiful Great Lawn.
A painless lower abdominal workout is always useful and an easy way to burn calories at your own fitness level. It’s just as easy as it sounds. Simply lie on your back with your knees bent, making sure your feet remain flat on the floor. Pull your belly button towards your spine and have your pelvis roll towards your shoulders. If you want to spice things up a bit, try single knee raises. Lie on your back and bring one knee up at a time in towards your chess, remembering to keep your abs tight and locked.
Reverse crunches are just as similar. Have your back pressed into the floor and contract your lower abs in order to raise your hips towards rib cage. As you do this exercise, you will notice your legs reaching the ceiling. Regular crunches also come in handy when you have an exercise ball. Lay on your back with your feet placed firmly on the floor. Push your upper body forward, rolling your shoulders towards your hips.
Try up to fifteen reps for the pelvic tilt and single knee raises. As for the reverse crunches, do up to twenty-five. Make sure for all these exercises to inhale slowly, go at your own pace and repeat three times a week for best results and a healthy body. Soon enough, you will have a flat stomach, and of course, a mean looking set of abs!

In our current economy, finding a job comes down to one thing: it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. I am sure many of you have heard this saying before and it is very disconcerting. However, there are things you can do to enhance your chances of getting that fabulous career you’ve always dreamed of. Although times are tough and getting a job is especially hard for our generation, it is still possible to land that great internship. Showing that extra effort will also show perseverance and dedication, which is something employers love to see. The first step to the career you’ve always wanted is getting yourself into the field, which can all being with an internship.
According to  www.quintcareers.com, “Internships help you better understand your field, help cement (or at times change) your career goals, and give you the experience employers demand – even of college graduates.” However, before even getting an internship students have many questions and concerns. Lucky for us students, C.W. Post has a department dedicated to helping us out. That department is called Academic and Career Counseling, located right in Kumble Hall. Once some research is done about what type of internship you may want to obtain, a visit with an advisor may help point you in the right direction.
Still, there are certain things you may want to consider beforehand. For example, would you be willing to take an internship that will provide you with beneficial experience but no paycheck? Or are you only interested in a paid job? There are also some other helpful things you may want to do before finding that perfect internship. First and foremost, make a list of companies you would enjoy working for and check out their websites to see if they offer internship opportunities. You may also want to attend a career/internship fair, which is often held at Hillwood Commons, and start working on an appealing resume. You should also see if it is possible to obtain college credit for internships, and even more importantly see if the internships require that you receive college credit for them. Last but not least, network! Networking is a sure way to get your name out there and it will help you out immensely in the long run.
Now that you know how to get an internship, the question is, when is the right time? Internships are only there to provide you with valuable experience so it is never too early to be a part of one. Having an internship will also allow you to get a feel for the different possible jobs in your desired field. That is especially helpful to students who enjoy their selected field but aren’t too sure of what they can do with it in the future. Although most majors require internships during senior year, getting one before then will only help you out. You will be given the chance to find out what you’re most interested in and more importantly, to network! A good place to start looking for an internship is the Internet; a website like http://www.internships.comcould be a great help. Now go and start searching for an internship and get some experience how life is in the real world. Good luck!

They call one another hermanas.  There are nine of them.  Each one has a different ethnicity, which includes Irish, African American, Puerto Rican, German and a few others.  Who are these “hermanas”?  They are the nine women members of the sorority Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi Sorority, Inc.
This is the newest sorority at our C.W. Post campus, as it was introduced this past spring.  This particular chapter is Upsilon, and was founded by nine students; Megan Williams, Alexandra Hochstrasser, Dana Munoz, Neidylin Morales, Nhya East, Lana Rosado, Kimberly Hughes, Melissa Herrera, and Vanessa Aden.
Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi Sorority, Inc., or as the members like to call it, LPC, was originally founded at Cornell University on April 16, 1988.  It was the first Latina sorority to be founded at an Ivy League institution.  However, although “Lambda Pi Chi was Latina-founded, it is not Latin-exclusive,” said Nhya East, one of the founding members at Post.
LPC’s main focus is on the professional and academic advancement of all ethnicities, combined with community service.  “We like to make our community aware of social and cultural issues affecting the community at large,” East said.  “But specifically the Latina community.”  They focus on empowering women.  “A lot of cultural organizations use numbers for their pledges,” said Alex Hochstrasser, vice president of LPC.  “But we don’t.  We never want you to forget who you are during your process and identify yourself as a number.  We want to empower you from who you already are.”
The idea of bringing LPC to Post was brought by a fellow hermana of the sorority, Janine Morgan.  “She was formally the Resident Hall Director of Kings and Suffolk halls,” Hochstrasser said.  “She had no intentions of bringing the sorority here, but after more and more women came to her asking questions about it, she gave us the email of the expansion committee of the sorority.”  Well, the rest is history!
Since LPC is new to Post, the hermanas are still promoting their sorority and making their presence known here on campus.  “We have felt very welcomed by the C.W. Post community,” said Megan Williams, President of Upsilon chapter.  “We hope to continue to grow as an individual organization as well.”  East added that they are doing everything they can. “This semester is like our trial run,” East said.  “People are starting to see our letters and starting to know who we are.”
This sorority has held numerous events already, including the “Flea Market,” which was co-sponsored with other Greek organizations; the dance-athon held in the Tilles Atrium a few weeks ago; and a “Friend or Foe” game show, which was co-sponsored with Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity.
“Community service is big for us,” East said.  LPC has dedicated and continues to dedicate much of their time towards events such as the blood drive, homeless awareness week, and Homecoming, among a few others.  East continued to say that contributing to the community in this way her sorority fulfills its main message to Post students.  “We want people to know not only what’s going on with Post life, but what’s going on in the outside world.  It’s important to be aware the professional world too because that’s what’s waiting for us outside of Post.”
But LPC has characteristics that are unlike any other sorority or fraternity on campus.  Many of the Greek organizations are centralized on one ethnicity or culture. “I respect all of the Greek orgs. but I just didn’t have a connection with the ones already here,” East said.  “So when I found out that other women were trying to bring this [LPC] to campus, I thought it’d be more of a diverse group to choose from.”
“Every organization has its own special aspect to it,” Hochstrasser added.  “Every organization is different from one another here at Post, it just all depends on which one fits you.”

Did you know that you don’t have to sacrifice your fitness plan just because you can’t make it to the Pratt Center?  Well the Pioneer heard your concerns and researched how you can stay in shape just by walking to class. You may be surprised to learn that brisk walking can be almost as challenging as jogging. Studies show that race-runners get just as good of a workout as walkers.
If getting to the Pratt Center is just out of the question, there are ways to stay in shape just by adjusting your route to class. Our friends at the Pratt Center have some really good tips on how to keep up with your workouts. The fitness advisors recommend that you really stick to your healthy diet but also suggest that you walk/ jog during common hour. Most people eat, sleep, study, or do homework during common hour, so why is taking a little jog so out of the question? Exercising in the middle of the day will help to raise your energy levels and keep you in a positive state of mind. We all know you’re tired, but exercising will actually reverse your fatigue.
Other ways of you improving your walking around campus is to invest in really good shoes. Without the right shoes you could be hurting your back and hips, and not getting all that you can out of your workout.  According to The American Academy of Podiatric sports medicine,  the highest rated brands of walking shoes are Asics, Brooks, New Balance, and Saucoy –all in which are at affordable prices! Good walking shoes are an important investment that will help your body overall.
Another way of improving your walk is to take a longer route to your class. Leave your dorm or house earlier and maybe park on the other side of campus.  By taking longer walks you are increasing your cardio levels and burning calories. Last but not least don’t be lazy, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walking up stairs is a great way to burn unwanted calories. Whereas these tips will not replace your Pratt Center workout they sure will help you keep on the right track. Good Luck Guys, use these tips wisely!

As the cold weather sets in and our work load builds up, college students tend to take on the winter blues –the time of year where we get sluggish, experience a loss of energy, a sense of fatigue, and absolutely no desire to work more than we need to. Right? We are finally done with midterms and professors have already started discussing dates for the final –students can’t help but question whether we are ever going to get a break. With the Thanksgiving holiday around the corner, we anticipate a time of complete relaxation until we learn that papers and presentations are due the days before and after it. Life for us college students can be hard and it can be stressful –if only there were an application on our “smart phones” to get us through the day. The days become shorter and it seems like there is just not enough time to get everything done. We are so mentally exhausted from the workload, we become physically unable to function. For those of us who can’t squeeze in a twenty-minute power-nap between classes, what is there to do that will give us energy to keep going?
In reading some of the questions submitted to  kateshealth@gmail.com, one popular concern was student exhaustion. An anonymous freshman complains, “Sometimes I feel like I need to snack more than usual because I am so exhausted. Junk food is the only thing that keeps me up in class. Please help!”  Well guys, this is completely normal and it happens to all of us. When we experience mid-day fatigue, and a nap is just out of the question, we tend to eat whatever is convenient and satisfying in that very moment. Since we don’t have time to prepare a healthy meal, we reach for whatever is quick and easy and we’re not to blame! There are however things to do and eat that will save you from your 2 p.m. crash, and help you get the energy to get through this last long week. It’s the homestretch people, let’s learn how to get through it right.
Water, not coffee. Although we think a second and third cup of coffee is the remedy for energy, it in fact does the opposite. The dose of caffeine undoubtedly gives us a quick energy boost, but after an hour or so we tend to crash because we become dehydrated. The key here is water. Before you give in to your third round of Java City, drink two cups of cold water right when you experience that first sense of fatigue. Water hydrates the cells, allowing your mind and body to feel refreshed and awake — giving off a much more stable boost of energy than coffee.

Vitamin C, vitamin C, vitamin C! Research shows that vitamin C has a positive effect of reducing symptoms of “chronic fatigue syndrome.” It not only provides an energy boost, but it aids in faster healing, the prevention of cancers, and helps fight depression. So yes, go cut up an orange in between classes, it does the trick.
Dark chocolate, yes chocolate. Studies show that chocolate, through it’s supply of antioxidants and small dosage of caffeine,  helps the body release energy-boosting endorphins. Without having the whole bar of chocolate, have a small piece when you find yourself dozing off in class –it’s just enough to get you focused.
Stretch! Go find a little secret spot in Hillwood Commons and get on the floor! Stretching helps release all tensions and stresses embedded deep in your mind and body, acting as an instant energy booster. Before class, or even on a quick bathroom break, go stretch your body and clear your mind, then re-approach your work.
Stay moving. Even though your absolutely exhausted, go for a walk and re-energize the mind. During your fifteen minute break, sometimes it is more beneficial to be active rather than sitting down relaxing. Taking a brisk walk will wake up your circulatory system by transporting nourishing oxygen throughout the body, allowing you to feel much more energized.
Keep focused during this homestretch to the holidays. Less than two weeks of classes before Thanksgiving break and it is no time to give up now. Get good rest, drink plenty of water, and try your best to stay active. Think healthy, you can do it!
Until next time, have a stress free and fully energized week!
Katie!

The new voting machines being used on Election Day in Suffolk County have been proven faulty, as it appeared to be an unofficial victory for incumbent Congressman Tim Bishop over Republican Randy Altschuler.
The Board Of Elections (BOE) in Suffolk County, located in Yaphank, NY, collects its information through phone calls by poll workers after the race has been closed. They read the tallies for each race. The next step is to post them online, where the BOE will then download the results electronically from each voting machine. It was during this process Alschuler took the lead. On Wednesday, November 3, the day after Election Day, the final count from the Suffolk County Board of Elections showed Altschuler leading, 92,702 to 92,319.
Now there is a costly $25,000 hand recount of all the ballots. Altschuler’s camp feels it is too soon for the recount and that Bishop’s camp is jumping the gun.  “The outcome of the audits should come first,” said Rob Ryan, Altschuler’s spokesman.
According to Sagharboronline.com, the Bishop camp intended to file a lawsuit with a Suffolk County judge to force the BOE to proceed with a paper ballot recount of all votes by hand. As of press time, the suit had yet to be filed.
On Monday, the Suffolk County Board of Elections began an audit of a randomly selecting 3 percent of its machines to ensure the downloaded results are in fact correct.

Monday, November 15th, marked the fifth annual International Education Week (IEW) dinner here on campus. The event was held in the Tilles Atrium and was hosted, for the first time, by the International Student Union (ISU). The night’s program included speeches by the Provost, Dr. Paul Forestell, and Geography professor, Dr. Mark Pires, three student reflections, and three international student performances. According to Taiwanese student, Eddy Hsiao, the event was well received by the audience.  “I’ve only been to two of these dinners so far,” said Hsiao. “This time, though, there was a larger audience and everyone really enjoyed it.”
The evening ended with the signing of the ISU banner decorated in the 53 flags of the different countries being represented here at Post.
“We were a bit disoriented at first,” said ISU President Jae Won Cheong.  “But with the incredible turnout tonight, I’m looking forward to this week.”
Each year the International Student Services arranges events to celebrate IEW. It is an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and exchange worldwide. Tomorrow, there will be a chance to experience different areas around the world in the eight residence hall lobbies on campus. On Thursday, the Indo-American Club will be in the Hillwood Commons lobby from 12:30-1:30pm to showcase the traditional Indian Henna Tattoo. On Friday, the ISU is sponsoring the basketball championship final where the Taiwanese Student Association will be competing with the Chinese Student Scholar Association at 8:00pm in the Pratt Center. To conclude the week on a Saturday, the ISU is sponsoring a party in the Long Island room from 9:30pm-2:00am.

“We’re all about spreading good changes for the environment within the campus,” Billy Achnitz, the C.W. Post Recycling Program coordinator, said.
The Recycling Program was brought to campus by the PEACE CORP around 2004. Even though the program’s main purpose is to recycle, it is a hands on experience as well as educational. Achnitz said that, “essentially, our staff collects the recycling and sorts through them and that is including all the residential areas. There’s the recycling component about it as well as the educational part of the program.”
The program has two environmental educators and two environmental assistances. They are responsible for publicity and carrying out information and Achnitz’s job is to oversee the entire program, and making sure everything runs smoothly.
Even though the Recycling Program is a separate entity within Student Life, they are an actual division. The program does not run as a regular club but is considered as any other job. For those students, who would like to join the Recycling Program, the program is interested in work-study students. Unfortunately, not all C.W. Post students have the benefits of work-study but Achnitz mentions, “I advise anybody that cannot join work-study to join PEACE. We are the ones that really focus on environmental issues.”
As for its next activity, the Recycling Program is participating in a Green Team competition this week. This involves collecting items like plastic bottles, cardboard, newspaper, writing instruments. “We go every year and this is our third time doing it. The athletic department loves it and they all get involved. The teams get really into it,” Achnitz said.
Last year, the Recycling Program collected 15 tons worth of recycling and they would want to double that amount within the next year to approximately 30 tons. “My main goal is to spread awareness, to get more people recycling and to show how recycling has an impact on the environment. Also to recycle more in general.”
Another goal that Achnitz would like to achieve is to meet with different administrations for the school to become more sustainable and to have more student input. Two main things that have been discussed by the Recycling Program is to spread the use of solar panels on buildings other than just Public Safety’s. It would also like to have a food composer.  Both of these idea would conserve energy within the campus.
Believe it or not, progress for environmental changes has been made and are still in progress. “A lot of people complain that they do not see change,” Achnitz said.  “But change is not going to happen overnight. If we can get everybody on board there can be a change.”
In many ways the program has impacted the campus.  “The fact that we are able to recycle 15 tons with the small amount of people we have is great,” Achnitz said.  “We went from four resident halls to all of them, and now the Pratt Recreational Center, and the chapel. Every little bit helps!”

College is a fast four years.  You move in, you let loose, find some good friends and POOF – it’s all over.  Then it’s you against the world staring into the eyes of your first employer who is probably hesitant to hire you in the first place.  Our advice? Take advantage of the time you have here at Post – study a little too hard, drink a little too much (not everyday) and become the independent person your mother truly wants you to be.
That being said, don’t be naïve either.  You should also take advantage of the amenities that surround you on a daily basis.  After we took a quick journalism trip to Washington D.C. last weekend, we found out that we have some great resources at our very fingertips…and so do you.  You know that addiction you have to social networking?  Well, use it.  A top reporter from Politico Magazine expressed to us learning journalism students that Facebook and Twitter are on the rise and can thoroughly help us network ourselves for future career opportunities.  That is why one of our staff writers offers some research and advice of her own on tweeting and the social networking phenomenon.
We are also featuring International Student Week this issue!  One reporter catches us up on the events that will be taking place all week long.  To wrap up the news for this week, our News Editor touches into some controversial politics that may have affected the recent midterm elections.  We have a large features section this week, as our Features Editor let’s us in on some ways to fight off those winter blues.  And as promised, we have another Greek Life profile piece in the features section as well.  Also, check out the latest in sports!
Last week, our contest winner, Melissa Bencosme, was awarded an IPAD. We would like to take this time to thank the Dean of Visual and Performing Arts Benjamin Moore and Director of Student Life and Leadership Development Alerie Tirsch for graciously donating our prize.  Please look out for brand new Holiday Giveaway contest! Fliers are posted all over campus.
And as always, keep on reading!  Have any comments?  Email us please, cwpstpnr@gmail.com.
