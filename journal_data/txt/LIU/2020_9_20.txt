Welcome back to campus. It has been a long time since we last published a print edition of The Pioneer back in March. Even though a lot has changed since then, one thing will always remain the same, our passion for providing our readers with accurate and up to date news relating to our campus. 
	In pursuit of this goal The Pioneer has added several exciting additions to the paper this semester. The newly added Health section will be covering the COVID-19 pandemic, both locally and nationally, as well as other topics related to the health of the student body and living a healthy lifestyle.
The Personal Essays section will be a special section dedicated to sharing writing submitted by students about their life experiences and topics they are passionate about. For this issue we have partnered with Herstory Writers Workshop to publish stories from the “Black Student Stories for Our Time” workshop that was hosted in conjunction with LIU over the summer. All students are welcome to submit writing that they would like to be featured in the section in upcoming issues.
As Editor-in-Chief I consider it my responsibility to ensure that The Pioneer continues to cover content that is important to the students and faculty of this university. It was impossible to cover everything that the Editorial Board and I would have liked to cover in just one issue, but we promise to leave no stone unturned and report on a wide variety of topics throughout the semester.
As always we encourage anyone wishing to leave us feedback or suggestions to contact us through email or on social media.
Sincerely, your Editor-in-Chief,
Dylan Valic

The NCAA has suspended all sports teams from participating in competition and has installed guidelines towards regulated practices. These guidelines have been placed until further notice from the NCAA. 
With sports seasons being cancelled or delayed some student athletes have been investing their time in other activities. “Now that sports are cancelled I’m mostly learning investing so I can save money and build my credit. That was something I did not have much time for before,” Tierra Gillett, a junior business management administration major, said. Other students have found this time to be useful to use towards academics. “During a semester, a great majority of my time and attention is devoted to rugby. With the limited hours allotted to sports now, my semester has been opened to a plethora of academic and personal improvement opportunities,” Sydney Long, a senior criminal justice major, said.
Some student athletes have described the change to their sports schedules as a whirlwind. “Now that sports are cancelled, my world has been thrown into a whirlwind,” Long said. Other student athletes have also found motivation to work harder during this unexpected break. “I’ll definitely be doing a lot more fitness and skill work to get back in shape so I can do great for my team when we can play again,” Gillett said.
Even with sports seasons being placed on hold, some student athletes have kept a positive outlook towards the future. “Not only do I get to focus greater on my studies, but I also get to work on bettering my individual athletic ability to give to my team once sports are back in session,” Long said. “The virus put a lot of things on hold, especially preseason and summer workouts. So I’ll definitely be just right by the time things are back to normal… whenever that is,” Gillett said.

Phi Delta Theta will be the 12th greek organization to join the campus this fall. The fraternity hopes to distinguish themselves by creating a newer definition of what it means to be a fraternity man at the Post campus.
Phi Delta Theta was founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in 1848 and has grown tremendously since then. The organization now has 191 chapters and colonies between the United States and Canada, with seven active in New York state. 
The fraternity’s three cardinal principles are friendship, sound learning and rectitude. These three principles support strong friendships between members, education, and having high moral standards.
Their philanthropic cause is raising money for ALS, also known as Lou Gerig disease, a nervous system disease that weakens muscles. The fraternity has a special tie to its philanthropy because Lou Gerhig was a member of Phi Delta Theta. The baseball legend went to Columbia University in 1921 where he joined the fraternity. 
Gregory Rush, an expansion consultant and member of Phi Delta Theta, explained the opportunity new members will have this fall. 
“The beauty in the expansion process is that you get a chance to build the visions and the goals of the frat from the ground up, as you would like to see at LIU,” Rush said. “It’s one of those things where the individuals we recruit and the individuals we talk to in the fall, they get the opportunity to really build the organization how they would like to see it so any events they would like to see those are things they can put their energy towards.”
Rush also encouraged anyone who might be interested to consider joining Phi Delta Theta. “I’m a first generation college graduate and first generation fraternity man, I didn’t see the value of greek life before I met Phi Delta at my campus,” he said. “I was initially hesitant because I wasn’t the ‘fraternity type,’ whatever that means, but once I joined I found myself in so many leadership roles and things.” 
Rush encourages others to not limit their thinking like he did, and to take a chance and try something new. “I would wholeheartedly encourage someone to reach out to myself or someone we’ve been talking to at the university because I think me telling myself that I wasn’t the fraternity type really limited my ability to see everything for what it was.”
Any students interested in joining Phi Delta Theta should contact Gregory Rush at grush@phideltatheta.org, or attend the organizations virtual Involvement Fair Zoom meeting on Thursday, Sept. 17 at 1 p.m.
