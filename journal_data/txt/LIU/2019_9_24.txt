 The campus shuttle to Hicksville, formerly known as the Ocelot shuttle and then the Pioneer Wagon, underwent a whole new make-over. The new Shark shuttle continues the same route from Hillwood Commons to the Broad-way Mall and then the Hicksville LIRR station, but this year, students are riding in style.
Beginning this semester, there is a larger shuttle bus transporting students to Hicksville. Inside, the shuttle has leather seats, seatbelts and a GPS tracking system that allows students to track the shuttle in real time, according to SGA President Ashley Rodriguez.   
“This year we have a bus, it’s more comfortable,” Laura Fernandez, junior nutrition major, said. “This semester so far I’ve gone about three times. And each [shuttle] was really different.” The first time she took the Shark shuttle, her ride was a coach bus with about 50 seats. Another time she rode on a vehicle that could fit approximately 2o people. “It was still comfortable and very nice,” she said.
Students who have ridden the shuttle in the past were surprised to find that the shuttle stop locations have also changed this semester. At the mall, the shuttle previously stopped outside of Macy’s department store entrance; now it stops at a small sidewalk in front of the Ikea parking garage. “This year, they drop you near Starbucks in front of Ikea. Last year, it was in front of the Burger Village,” Fernandez said.
At the LIRR station, the shuttle used to stop at the westbound side parking lot; now it stops by the sidewalk on Newbridge Road, beside the eastbound parking lot.    
One student, junior health and physical education major Troy Bension, is satisfied with the changes. “The stops are more convenient and there is more comfort and room for more people [inside],” Bension said.
However, these changes to the shuttle bus’s stops were not announced to the LIU community at large. One faculty member who regularly takes the shuttle was not pleased with the changes. He found out the hard way about the new stops when the shuttle never appeared at the original stop at the LIRR station on the first day of classes. The new shuttle busses do not have any markings to indicate it is the Post shuttle as opposed to any other bus. The professor, who did not want to be named, worried that students would have a hard time finding the bus.
Though the confusion could end soon, according to Rodriguez. “The shuttle bus will eventually be completely designed with our school logo and colors around the bus,” she said. The busses might also get smaller. The reason for the new, larger busses, Rodriguez said, is because the old shuttles were in need of maintenance repairs.

Many students are running away in fear as swarms of bees and wasps follow them around campus. These sly stingers are wreaking havoc indoors and outdoors, and either way, students and faculty can’t escape them.  
From the dorms to the classrooms to the patio areas, families of wasps are hiding out in crevasses while they eye the sweetened drinks in hands of passersby. Students attempting to study or eat their lunch in peace are continuously interrupted by their presence.  
The yellow and black flying insects showed their faces Monday morning while Pamela Garcia, a freshman health science major, stopped to grab breakfast with a friend. “My friend got coffee and the bees just started coming,” Garcia said. They had no choice but to scream and run away. 
Another friend of Garcia’s, freshman biology major Krystal Mahase, also encountered wasps since she began classes. “I’ll just be sitting here, and they’ll tell me there’s a bee behind me, and I’ll just start screaming,” she said. Screams are heard all throughout campus because of the insect, according to Mahase. “I scream just like that,” she said, while referencing another student’s shrieking in the background due to bees. 
Student complaints about the bees and wasps don’t go unnoticed, and some may not realize the school’s maintenance and facilities team are often tending to the problem. “As soon as we receive info through a work order, we deploy an exterminator and address the issue right away,” said Executive Director of Facilities, Roy Fergus. “For instance, there are high areas to get to, so you’ll see manlifts around or on campus that we use to treat areas at any height.”
But the infestation of bees and wasps are also in areas where students may find them difficult to avoid.  Destin Trammell, a senior speech and language pathology major, said the bees were a nuisance while trying to do school-work in the Head Quarters computer lab in Hillwood Commons. 
“I see the bees flying near the ceiling and they were flying into the light fixtures, and when they would get hot, I guess, they would just fly back down,” she said. “We were printing in this area and they were swarming right over and around it,” she said. In addition to bees buzzing around the heads of students concentrating on their work, there are numerous dead ones scattered on the floors of the lab and the hallway that leads to it. 
Dominique Williams, a senior health science major who plays for the women’s basketball team and lives in Brookville Hall, said she hasn’t been stung yet, but was chased around a couple of tables. 
“I know last year when we would be in the gym a lot, there would be bees around the court. There would be physical bees, dead bees, on the court,” she said. “I know my teammate got stung last year in front of Winnick, and this year there were bees in my dorm room,” she said. Williams notified the custodians about the bugs, but they told her the bees were getting in because people left the doors open. 
The Center of Healthy Living confirmed at least one student a week visits their office because of a bee sting but couldn’t confirm an exact number or the procedure they follow when tending to students to them. When the Pioneer asked the center for advice on how students can tend to a sting on their own, or what a student with a bee allergy should do in case of emergency, they declined to comment. 
Towards the summer and spring months, the presence of bees and wasps are inevitable, according to Fergus. “It’s just the nature of our campus,” he said, but reassured that every week, an exterminator applies a controlled, green level application to remove the buzzing pests. He consults with his staff regularly as to where bees have been spotted and does his best to ensure the campus remains a safe and bug free environment.

 The Student Body Boutique held its grand reopening Monday, Sept. 23, at its new location on the first floor of Hillwood Commons. The new location allows students and faculty to eas-ily browse and purchase current fashion trends.
The boutique, which was previously in the center storefront space on the second floor of Hillwood, is now located just across from Starbucks. “The store moved actually because we needed a bigger space, and we needed more attention to the space,” said freshman Madeline Jordan, a fashion merchandising major and boutique sales clerk. 
The boutique’s executive board, which consists of fashion merchandising majors and minors, preferred the new space because it’s a location that generates more foot traffic, according to Cherie Serota, professor of fashion merchandising. “It doesn’t hurt in terms of getting people around the store and into the store, with a cup of coffee or without a cup of coffee, it’s fine either way,” she said.
Added at the new location is an upgraded dressing room, making it easier for customers to purchase the correct size. The boutique staff are also ramping up their accessory merchandise and have plans for a future “Instagrammable” wall. “If you notice, there’s a black wall on the left-hand side of the boutique. We’re going to use that as a space where the student population at large can come in and decorate that wall in any way they’d like,” Serota said. 
Each month, the CMO will introduce a new theme for the wall and advertise it to the student body.  Students can look forward to different contests which involve displaying their artwork or coming up with new and creative artwork in the store, according to Serota. The wall will also incorporate a trend watch organized and managed by the fashion club and students from the fashion merchandising program. “You can include all kinds of components. Music, art, it’s really the Zeitgeist of fashion,” she said, “We are inspired by everything around us in the fashion world.”
There are various areas the board desires to explore and revisit like collaborations with shops in and around town. Last spring, they collaborated with the Junior League Thrift Shop in Roslyn and brought in all kinds of vintage merchandise for a short period of time. New items are always flowing in, and their buys are done by the season. Serota recommends that those who stop in the boutique at the beginning of the semester, check back often. “There’s a piece of something for everybody here,” Jordan said. “There’s jewelry, school supplies, clothes, jackets, pants, anything anyone could need.”
While merchandise sold in the boutique is selected and purchased primarily by the executive board and The Fashion Network Club, students in FM 20 are invited to join them on the buying trip to New York City to learn and participate in the experience. Structure of the board members change each year, and 2019’s board members include CEO Julia Porter, CMO Christina Pasqualicchio, COO Nyasia Folk, and Hema Chimpidi, who serves as the liaison between the fashion club and the boutique. The board is currently searching for a CFO.  
The fashion merchandising program incorporates the content of its curriculum in several of its courses by engaging students in the boutique’s operations. “In two or three of our classes we’ve engaged the students in a learning component actually live in the store,” Serota said. FM 12 – business of fashion merchandising, FM 14 – math for merchandising, FM 20 – buying for the fashion industry and FM 50 – visual merchandising and display are all courses which utilize the store for engaged learning, according to Serota.
The Student Body Boutique encourages new ideas, which are always welcome because it’s a student run organization, according to Serota. They’re looking to involve students and their ideas from all over campus. “We welcome anyone in the university to help out with the store and to engage in the learning experience,” she said.
