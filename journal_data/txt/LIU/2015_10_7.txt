Homecoming is a college tradition older than sliced bread. Literally. The tradition began in 1891, in Kansas City, Missouri, and has continued for 124 years. The tradition behind homecoming is to welcome back the school’s alumni, and celebrate your school together.
Post, founded in 1954, is continuing the tradition by hosting its annual homecoming celebration Oct. 9 – Oct. 11. While Post strives to enhance their pep rally, they maintain the tradition of showcasing their fall teams and Post Pride.
Campus Life plans all homecoming events at LIU; roughly 750 to 1,000 students and community members take part in the homecoming festivities. One of the biggest homecoming attractions is the pep rally, happening on Friday, Oct. 9. This year, students and faculty attending the pep rally can expect to see performances by LIU’s cheerleaders, the Student Dance Association, and the dance team.
“We’re both really excited as part of the dance and cheer team to get to perform together for our first pep rally as freshman,” said freshmen Shannon Rocks, a Business Administration major, and Miranda Alldaffer, a Biomedicine major.
“It’s great seeing the student-athletes enjoy the pep rally as I did when I was a student-athlete here at Post,” said Raenee Savin, Coach of LIU’s field hockey team. “It’s always nice when we can all be together showing our Post Pride and supporting one another.”
“I’m super excited,” said Abigail Sawyer, a junior Psychology major, and member of the field hockey team. “I think it’s a great way to bring together both commuters and residents for a fun event with loads of activities. I hope to see a good turn out and have a fun night with my team and friends.”
According to Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life, this year’s pep rally will end in a surprise grand finale that is sure to impress students.
Following the pep rally, on Saturday will be the annual football game, this year against Merrimack College. Before, and continuing through the football game, the excitement will continue with a tailgate in the Pratt parking lot.
“I think it will hold a lot of opportunities to find out about the fraternities/sororities and organizations on campus to get involved with,” Sawyer said.
Homecoming is not just for current students and faculty but also for alumni to enjoy. Many alumni return to campus for the football game and to reminisce of the “good ol’ days.”
This year’s homecoming will also feature Post alumnus, and television personality, Joseph Gatto, star of “Impractical Jokers,” on TruTV, who is set to receive the Alumni Award.

On Sept. 25, Campus Life administrators and several student leaders went to YMCA campground in Greenkill, New York, for an annual retreat. The main focus was to create better bonds between student clubs and organizations, in addition to looking at Post in the past, present, and future. Many students look forward to this yearly retreat because it brings student leaders together to reflect on their current and
future endeavors.
“It is important to take student leaders away from the campus and engage them in a dialogue about campus life,” said Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life. “We provide an intense, educational, and inspirational program that allows student leaders to have conversations with each other about how they can improve life at LIU Post.”
Several student leaders were excited for different aspects of the retreat. “I’m excited to get representatives from each club and organization in one room together; this is a great opportunity to network and make
some really solid connections,” said Adam Hornbuckle, a sophomore Political Science major and SGA Vice President.
“In addition,” Berthel added. “We challenge students to look at their own organizations, how they promote, and engage the student population.”
On the first day, YMCA camp counselors divided the students into groups and worked on leadership and communication skills through team building exercises and games. This was followed a Safe Zone Training held by the assistant director of Campus life, Joseph Vernace. The training consisted of making it aware to students that different people make up not only our campus community, but society as well.
Additionally, Christopher Whitehead, Programming Specialist, did a Diversity Training. This training session consisted of how to better perceive diversity and to have a more inclusive society.
The Greek organizations and clubs separated into two rooms and set short term and long term goals for each other. Later in the day, all attendants came together and discussed the changes that have occurred on campus in the last year.
“Students were so positive about the changes on campus and the direction of the University,” Berthel said. “It was a really proud moment for our staff and we really enjoyed the conversations we were able to have.”
Campus life and campus leaders ended the night with a bonfire on the campground. “My favorite part of the retreat was the late night hangouts with each other,” said Kelsey D’Andrea, a senior Musical Theatre major, representing the PanHellenic association. “It helped me meet people, and allowed us to be united. There was a round of card games, singing, and lots of laughs, which is why I enjoyed it so much.”

It’s almost impossible to deny that our campus is beautiful. No matter the season or part of campus you’re looking at, it is always a great view.
This semester, the university has added to the campus new tables that have LIU Post green and gold umbrellas for students, faculty, and staff to sit, eat, and hang out.
The tables have been placed in different locations around campus where students and faculty often populate in great numbers. In front of Humanities there are six, The Doll House has five, Winnick Dinning Hall has 12, and the football field, the Bethpage Stadium, has 15 tables.
“Post consistently makes campus improvements to keep the grounds looking their best so that the on-campus experience is a positive one for students, faculty, and visitors,” said Joseph Schaefer, Chief of Administration and Student Affairs.
“I think it encourages people to be outside and socialize more rather than sit in their own room by themselves,” said Abagail Sawyer, a junior Psychology major. “It also makes our already beautiful campus look better with the LIU Post umbrellas.”
“The new tables are a great addition to the campus and promote an active and social campus life,” said Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life. “I love seeing students use them to hang out with friends, study before class, or to just relax and enjoy the campus.”
The tables provide students with an additional, convenient place to sit and mingle, especially during common hour, when Hillwood Commons is crowded.
“They’re nice! And really good for when you have to meet for group work and it’s nice out,” said Lauren Adamusik, a junior Public Relations major. “I think it makes it more inviting and open for more people to hang out and meet more people.”
In addition to the new tables, flowers are also planted around the campus during the year.
“LIU is committed to keeping our campus healthy, safe, and beautiful,” Schaefer said. “This involves providing excellent circulation routes throughout campus and caring for a vast and diverse plant and flower community between the buildings and pathways.”
Schaefer added that the University has an ongoing process of evaluating future projects and is always looking into additional spaces that can improve overall student life. He mentioned that students are always “welcome to share their thoughts, suggestions and feedback via the Campus Life office.”

The word “drone” is defined in the dictionary as a verb and a noun. The verb relates to a continuous sound that can be made. As a noun, it is often associated with a type of bee. One last definition, however, has been the subject of much recent controversy and interest. Nowadays, a “drone” also refers to “a remote-controlled pilotless aircraft or missile.”
On Tuesday, Sept. 29, Assistant Professor of Media Arts, Benjamin Gerdes, spoke during common hour about drones as part of the College of Arts, Communication and Design Dean’s Lecture series.
Gerdes relates his interest in drones to his interest in cinema and video production. “I started working in film and video because it had a kind of charge or potential to me, but also, there were just certain shots that you just feel ‘that does something for me’,” said Gerdes during his lecture. Although shorter shots and small scenes do not tell the entire story of a film, these short clips are what Gerdes finds most fascinating. “Sometimes it’s not necessarily about a literal meaning…but what does this convey? And from my own perspective, it means something,” he said.
Gerdes first became interested in drones once he noticed the shift in the way drones were being covered by the media and the public. “We are in the middle of a big shift in terms of drones being an international topic about the U.S military, to being a consumer, domestic technology,” he said.
Perspective is a good word to use when describing drones, as they provide a viewpoint that is otherwise hard to achieve. “I was most excited about the moment where it accelerates quickly and takes off from the grass as a piece of imagery,” Gerdes said. Although drones are most often used to fly from place to place, using drones as a visual tool “relates to the entire history of film and video,” Gerdes added.
According to Gerdes, as filming techniques became more and more widespread, the use of particular lenses and effects began to die out, as it became a mainstream part of the filmmaking process. He finds the same similarities with drone use. “That tension to me between seamless flight and someone making choices is an interesting thing about [drone] footage,” Gerdes said.
Since the use of drones does not yet have an established specific purpose for filmmakers, Gerdes raised the question to his audience “If someone in the future discovered a drone, what kind of tool would they think that was?”
With the U.S. Military conducting controversial drone strikes, many are pondering whether or not drone access should be restricted. There is ongoing discussion on who should be able to access, possess, and use drones. At this point, there does not seem to be a definite answer on how, or if, access should be regulated. According to Gerdes, there should be some middle ground. “You don’t want a completely unregulated environment,” he said.
Robert Riepe, a sophomore Broadcasting major, attended Gerdes’ lecture. Having a familiarity with drones through “observation and industry media,” he cited a few practical real world uses for drones, besides basic traveling from one GPS coordinate to another.
“In South Korea, drones are used in and outside of stadiums to get a grand view of the audience entering or leaving,” Riepe said.
Drones are still a new, rapidly evolving technology that will continue to provide us with ways to accomplish tasks. Exactly what tasks, however, remains to be seen.

Controversies on minimum wage not being sufficient enough have been in the news for some time now. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York said, “The wage gap is continuing to grow, despite last year’s minimum wage increase. The second tier for New York City reflects the higher cost of living there.”
Gov. Cuomo is trying to settle the hourly rates at $10.50 for New York state, and $11.50 for New York City by the end of 2016.
Many employees support their family on minimum wage but sometimes one job is not enough to keep them out of crisis. The state’s current minimum wage is $8.75, but by the end of 2015, minimum wage will increase gradually to $9.00.
“I definitely think that minimum wage should be higher than $8.75,” said Christine Buscemi, a junior Nutrition major. “Some people never had the opportunity to get an education or college degree, so it’s unfair to not allow them to make more money. No one should have to work over 40 hours a week to support their family and make ends meet.”
The cost of living in New York is very high. After taxes are deducted from an individual’s salary, not much is left for them to spend to enjoy their hard work. “I think it’s not sufficient enough to support
the family,” said Nahid Sultana, a junior Business Management major.
“Things are very expensive. One of the major expenses that takes a person’s paycheck is rent. Another factor is transportation. MTA raised the fare from $112 to $116.50 for a monthly, unlimited card. It’s not just rent and transportation that’s hurting the citizens, other expenses are involved like healthcare, food and families that have kids going to college. I believe the minimum wage should increase to standard living cost,” Sultana said.
Mitchell Zandes, a senior Nutrition major, agreed with Sultana’s opinion, adding, “In today’s economy, you can hardly get a bite to eat or enjoy a leisurely activity without spending upwards of $15.00-$20.00. Nobody should have to work long hours to hardly get by, and that is why I believe employees should be compensated with increased wages.”
Senior Economics major, Mijail Mariano, gave an economics view on minimum wage. “There are many pros and cons in increases on the minimum wage. Yet at the end of the day, I feel that the pros outweigh the cons. Increasing minimum wage increases consumer expenditure, which stimulates the economy; the increase has the potential of starting a positive trickle effect throughout the entire economy. So sure, let’s raise it up a little.”
The controversies on whether or not current minimum wage is enough will always be prevalent. With prices going high, the value of money is decreasing. Due to inflation, some would agree that New York is soon going to see a decrease in the number of employees as a result of the minimum wage.

He may be the most influential man on Earth. He is a man of God and a man of faith, but most importantly, a man of humility.
The 266th Pope arrived in the United States on the 266th day of the year, Sept. 23. America is home to nearly 80 million self-identified Catholics. According to an ABC poll, 92 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the pope.
However, in a country where enrollment in Catholic schools has been on decline since the 60s, and only 24 percent of Catholics attend church weekly — a percentage that was once as high as 55 percent in 1965, according to a Georgetown study on Catholicism in America, from 2015 — the question raises itself: How does a papal visit affect America?
To start, we live in America, the hardest working country on Earth. This is not an opinion; it’s a fact. Americans take less vacation days, work longer hours, and retire later in life than any other country in the industrialized world. This includes countries such as France, England, Germany, and China. With that said, in capitalist America, religion, typically takes a backseat due to our jobs, families, and our hard work to make ends meet. It’s an ugly truth, but it’s the truth, nonetheless.
“I used to go to church every week growing up,” said Lauren Archer, a sophomore Chemistry major, who’s also Catholic. “Don’t get me wrong, I still keep God close to my heart, but am I close to church and actually ‘practicing’ my faith like how I used to? Not quite.”
When asked if the Pope’s visit to America changed her perspective on her faith and how she practices, Archer said, “It did open my eyes. It showed me that if one man can devote his entire life to God, then why can’t we just give an hour a week?”
“I played every snap like it was my last,” said Tristan Quarless, a senior Communications major, who was the former wide receiver for his high school football team. “Literally, all I knew was on speed. I went over the middle for a pass, caught the ball, turned it up the sideline, and then I felt like I got kicked in the back of my leg. I fell, looked around to see who did it, but no one was around.” At that moment, Quarless had torn his Achilles in his right foot. “It was a terrible day, but that day brought me closer to my roots, and my faith,” Quarless said.
Quarless described the Pope’s visit as an awesome and uplifting one. “When you hear a humble man like the Pope speak,” he said, “it humbles you; allowing you to put everything into perspective, and make you want to live a better life.”
I can vouch for Quarless. Life comes with ups and downs. Even at the beginning of a semester when you’re hit with schoolwork, trying to balance a class schedule, work, and a social life, it can get pretty challenging.
However, the Pope’s visit to New York affected me greatly. Although I was not able to see him face-to-face, just knowing the Pope was in America, in my city, brought a feeling of reassurance; a feeling of reassurance that didn’t just resonate within me, but within the entire region, and Catholics all across the country.

How many teachers, coaches, and parents have spoken to you like you’re still a child?
There seems to be this lingering notion that as college students are still considered kids and that our freedoms should be limited by ‘grown ups.’ However, I would go as far as to state that when we are tossed into the world of university life, we become adults. It infuriates me when I am patronized. There is no need for it, especially when I am probably more independent and socially shrewd than they ever were at my age.
Although I feel very strongly about this subject — maybe I am biased towards people our age, and our regularly abused generation — I do feel the need to ask: is it that we give the impression that we are still children who need minding?
Many people in college are indeed void of responsibility or independence, and still rely on things to be spelled out for them, as well as being looked after by their parents, or a surrogate for their parents, such as a coach or a professor. If this is you, maybe you need to grow up and take accountability for the way you live and the way you do things on a day-to-day basis. Try to be your own person.
Students that still need to be mothered are not preparing themselves for the ‘Spartan’-like world after college; the world of corporate wolves and money-making snakes. You need to be able to handle hardship, and get used to the fact that your parents will not be there to catch you when you fall. Therefore, if a professor gives you a simple assignment that may require you to put in a little extra work: get it done! Don’t give them a reason to blame adolescents for lack of effort or ability.
Alfred Lindberg, a senior International Studies major, discussed with me the annoyance of patronization from professors or other people with a higher ‘stature’ than us. There is no need for it! In fact, I believe that if you are told and treated that you are one specific thing, i.e. a kid, then you will begin to act like one.
Therefore, if a teacher shows a lower level of respect towards a student and doesn’t offer professional help, how can they expect anything more than a childlike assignment? Students in college vary in ages mainly ranging from 17-24. Most of these students commute to school or dorm by themselves. This is a responsibility of an adult, right?
While many students, still need to mature and grow up, they do have responsibilities similar to those that their professors or coaches have.
Many athletic teams have numerous rules and guidelines that they must adhere to. Failure to adhere to these guidelines lead to “consequences,” but many of the students are in the age bracket, as I mentioned above, ages where there should be an expectation of maturity, especially for an athlete.
However, having constant restrictions forced upon you and continuous bombardment of “you can’t do that,” or “you must get this signed,” really isn’t showing the student-athletes that they are of age to fend and take responsibility for themselves.
Different cultures make a massive difference. The reason for this is the difference of the social norm. For example, on the soccer team, the majority of the players are from Europe. Most of the players that make the long journey across the Atlantic, have to fund their own education, cook food for themselves in off campus housing, and endure the hard times of losses in games, bad injuries, or the depressing workload from school, without having families nearby. Not having the support of our parents and having to use our own money to live, gives us all the incentive to work hard and prosper in this magnificent journey that we are on.
Maybe the students here at Post have it too easy? This could be the reason why professors show such a lack of respect, in some instances, because perhaps in their generation it was different. However, the ability to treat another adult like an adult isn’t hard, and this is an extremely important part of growing up for students at college.

When a white van with green and yellow words is spotted on campus, be aware and move swiftly to ensure you are not blocking the safety vehicles from passing. While walking to class, instead of waiting for the public safety trucks to move, it is easier to just walk around them. Have you ever changed your direction in walking because of a public safety truck? If you can identify with any of these scenarios, join the club, because you are not alone.
Public Safety serves a great purpose, to create a presence on campus to make the students of LIU Post feel safe. “Public Safety is only making sure that we get to our classes safely,” said Adam Goedeon, a sophomore Radiology Technology major.
The Public Safety vehicles affect Post negatively, as well. There are certain times when campus gets congested, those times being right before 9:30 a.m. classes, during Common Hour, and after Common Hour. You would like to think that during these times, Public Safety would clear the path to avoid traffic, right? Nope! These vehicles can be found on the walkways and pavement near Humanities, as well as Hillwood Commons. Yes, we get it, the more students there are, the more important it is to be present.
Public Safety should park on the grass more often, or on the side of buildings, for example, by Humanities and Hillwood Commons. Parking directly in front of the door outside of Hillwood Commons is not the smartest thing to do, because it creates blockages similar to driving on a highway or intersection where there is a blockage.
“I would think it would be problematic because there are so many who move throughout Hillwood and Humanities throughout the day,” said Ervin Gonzales, a sophomore Musical Theater major. “On the other hand, it is good because they are there to make sure nothing bad happens.”
When there is a huge truck in front of you while rushing to class, it creates a domino effect of issues. When the truck is blocking a walk-way, it creates traffic and when traffic occurs, one could possibly be late to class. If you’re like me, you hate being late to class, I’m sure your professors aren’t too fond of it either.
If a student is late to class, their professor may look at the student as being irresponsible and disrespectful, especially if they are the type of professor who waits until most of the students arrive, before beginning the lecture.
Public Safety vans on the walkways of campus can be a little scary. Student have to pay very close attention to where they are going, especially when rushing to class, a campus event, or even to a work-study job. Not to mention, our generation is very into technology, so most likely when a student is walking, they are possibly scrolling through Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, or texting. While looking down at a device and walking, numerous Public Safety vehicles can be dangerous for that student, as well as for Public Safety themselves.
“I’ve become so accustomed to seeing the Public Safety cars everywhere, that now it’s just the norm; and I’m not sure if that’s a good thing,” said Britney Mitchell, a junior broadcasting major.
If you’re on campus and see a Public Safety vehicle, be aware and open your eyes to avoid an unwanted accident. Other things you can do to avoid some of the discussed negative impacts is to try and leave earlier to avoid getting to class late, or take pathways to your destination that are less likely to have Public Safety vehicles.
I think that Public Safety vehicles should get a horn or an automated voice that announces that the area they are occupying may be dangerous, and every person should clear the path. Why not? It would solve one of the biggest problems in the morning, during Common Hour, and after, which is traffic control.
Beep, beep! Hey, Public Safety, we’re walking here!
Representatives from Public Safety did not want to comment on the issue.

We have all had that need for a grab-and-go snack or lunch, and the options seemed to be limited…until now. As the new semester has started, we are sure everyone has noticed the new food establishments on campus. With a busy schedule it is great to have options for “on-the- go” convenience. This article is your one-stop guide to navigating the new eateries. Let us help you add variety to your diet in a quick, easy, and healthy way.
The Doll House is a quick-stop outpost where you can purchase food and beverages with your dining dollars. Get some extra zzz’s and grab any of these breakfast items to start your day: coffee, tea, fresh fruit, yogurt parfait, hard-boiled eggs, bagels, and breakfast pastries. Mid-day snack options include Italian ices, gelato, Kettle chips, gluten-free brownies, and Pioneer hot dogs with a variety of toppings. When you’re not in a rush, grab a seat at the picnic tables for a relaxing break on Riggs Lawn.
Relax in the library during study breaks in the cozy atmosphere of the Bleeker Street Café. The menu features: freshly made egg sandwiches, a daily variety of paninis, seasonal gourmet soups, salads, sushi, fruit cups, and coffee. Hot-off-the-press paninis are boxed up with a piece of fruit to complement your meal. The Bleeker Street Café has seating available Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Student demand for Tex-Mex cuisine on campus has been answered with Twisted Taco in Hillwood. “I am happily surprised with the Twisted Taco,” said senior Ava-Miranda Stone.
A food service worker said, “the meats are freshly cooked each morning and you can definitely tell!” They offer burritos, homemade salsas, guacamole, nachos, tacos, and quesadillas. Most everyone loves Mexican cuisine and now you can satisfy your craving right on campus, Monday through Thursday beginning at 11:30 a.m., and open late until 11 p.m.
For those stuck at the far-end of campus, you no longer have to depend on vending machines for a meal. The Pioneer Wagon Food Truck offers snacks and protein bars, hot breakfast sandwiches and pastries, grilled items, signature sandwiches, pizza, salads, yogurt, and beverages. The food truck makes its way around to Lorber Hall, Pratt, and the Fine Arts Center, Monday through Thursday at 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Overall, Post has made a tremendous effort in listening to your wants and needs and we believe they have successfully fulfilled them. Next time you’re scrambling for a bite to eat, try something new at one of these campus eateries.
Nutritionists’ Picks:
● Hard-boiled eggs, fruit, and the yogurt parfait are sensible bites at the Doll House.
● Chicken pesto panini, egg sandwich, and brown rice sushi are tasty choices at the Bleeker Street Cafe.
● At the Twisted Taco, build-your-own taco, burrito, quesadilla,
or salad. Be sure to include your protein and vegetables, but watch your toppings! Chips with salsa or guacamole make for a great side.
● Hummus, string cheese, sandwiches, and salads are our go-tos at the Wagon. Grab a PowerBar for quick fuel if there’s no time for a meal.

After spending the better part of six seasons playing fitness nut and government manager Chris Traegar on Parks and Recreation, Rob Lowe returns to TV this fall as an actor looking for a new life after his TV show goes off the air.
Lowe stars as Dean Sanderson, one half of the Sanderson brothers, an actor who played a lawyer on TV in his hit show The Grinder. Joining Lowe is Fred Savage, who plays Dean’s younger brother, Stewart. Unlike Dean, Stewart became a lawyer and now works at the family’s law firm along with their father.
As the pilot opened on Sept. 29, we see the family watching the series finale of The Grinder. After the episode, Dean explains that he has to find a new path in his life now that his show is over. The next day, Dean, Stewart, and their father travel to the courthouse where Stewart is representing a couple in an eviction case.
At the courthouse, Stewart has to use note cards due to his lack of confidence. After speeding his way through the defense, Dean steps in and suggests taking the case to trial. With this decision, Dean decides to become an actual lawyer and work with his brother and father, much to the disdain of Stewart.
The night before the case, the two brothers have a fight and Dean announces he will leave the next morning.
The next day, Dean hangs out at a bar and was convinced by a bartender to go to the courthouse, thus The Grinder comes to the rescue. Dean then takes over the courtroom and breaks every rule in the book, thereby giving Stewart the confidence to finish the job. At the end of the episode, Dean is ready to leave and move on with his life, but Stewart asks him to stay and work with him.
Like any comedic pilot, good and bad jokes find their way throughout the script. The more successful ones involve meta humor, where the characters make illusions to the fact that they are in a television show. One joke in particular that stood out was when Rob Lowe gets to repeat his “Literally!” catchphrase from Parks and Recreation one more time.
Overall, the episode was enjoyable and contained enough humor to keep it entertaining and fresh. The Grinder is just one of 33 new shows premiering this fall. Let’s hope The Grinder can sustain enough momentum to make viewing the show a pleasant experience.
New episodes of The Grinder will air on Tuesday nights at 8:30 p.m. on Fox.

Homecoming is right around the corner and it’s expected to be one of the largest events in the history of LIU Post. Susan Stickley, Tilles Center’s Director of Marketing and Communication said that the events will bring together an anticipated 10,000 distinguished alumni and celebrities.
Seth Meyers, former SNL star and current NBC Late Night host will be one of the celebrities who will make a very special appearance during these festivities. He will be having a show right after the Pep Rally on Friday, Oct. 9.
“Seth Meyers will take center stage for an evening of comedy at Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at LIU Post,” Stickley said. “Tilles Center is thrilled to bring Meyers to our students, alumni and community, and excited to take advantage of this rare opportunity to showcase his stand-up routine.”
According to Stickley, the event that was coordinated both by the Alumni office and Tilles Center has taken months to put together. “Due to Meyers’ broad appeal, we anticipate welcoming attendees of all ages to this public event,” Stickley said.
Students seem to be really excited about the act and what Meyers will be bringing to the stage. “The event is guaranteed to bring attendees lots of laughs throughout an interactive evening of cutting edge hilarity,” Stickley added.
Marisa Kofmehl, a senior Public Relations major, said that she is really happy with this choice. “I am so glad they decided to bring an act like Seth for homecoming,” Kofmehl said. “I think that with all of his performances on SNL, a lot of people really enjoy his comedy and it’s different from other acts that we usually have on campus.”
Post alumni, Sadie Hofler, who graduated in 2014 with a B.S. in Social Work, said she will definitely be coming back to campus to see Meyers. “I was very excited when I heard he’d be coming to Post,” said Hofler. “I am glad it’s during homecoming since it’s a perfect time and a lot of alumni’s can enjoy of all the other events going on too.”
Stickley assures us that there will be many more acts like this in the future. In fact the Tilles Center has booked actor/comedian John Leguizamo in April, and continues to seek artists who appeal both to students and the general public.
Full-time LIU students will have the opportunity to get discounted tickets, available at the Tilles Center’s Box Office, for only $15 a ticket.

Last school year, the Art and Art History Club painted faces at Homecoming. This time around they plan to not only do that, but provide another creative way to show Post pride.
“We’re planning to [make] a big poster with POST written out in wax,” said senior Arts Management major and club secretary, Hannah Fitch. “Then we’ll fill up water balloons with paint and throw them at it. The idea is that when [people] throw [the balloons] the wax will not allow any paint over the letters.”
In preparation, the club is optioning various ways of constructing the poster and propping it up as a balloon target. These options include using painters tape, wax paper, melted wax, or crayons over the lettered areas. By involving participants to throw the balloons, showering the poster in color, the club will be demonstrating a collaborative art piece for Post pride.
A bake sale and the aforementioned face painting will also be included at the Art and Art History homecoming stall along with the balloon throwing, which will be free. All proceeds going towards club funding.
The Art and Art History Club meets Wednesdays in Hillwood Commons room 114 during common hour. All students are welcome. Members enjoy organized museum visits, coordinate lectures by art professionals and actively promote student and faculty art projects on campus. For more information, visit the Art and Art History club facebook page.
Homecoming festivities will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Oct. 10.

Wes Anderson –the King of quirk. An idiosyncratic idol. The ultra-stylistic filmmaker whose work offers bounds of offbeat moments, family dysfunction and a lingering feeling of melancholic sentimentality. It’s no secret that the man has a unique way of presenting his stories, but what the hell are we actually watching? Is Mr. Anderson just indulging himself? Is this “style-over-substance”? Is there a deeper reasoning here?
What I propose is that nothing we see in an Anderson film is supposed to be reality as it happened, but actually the memory or mind’s eye of one or more people combined into the expressionistic rendition
of the story at hand. A distinct, purposeful unreality.
His world is firmly set within the limitless confines of memory and the mind, free to be as brightly colored and exaggerated as can be, adding up to punctuate the story in a specific way. Before you think I’m crazy, consider how Anderson’s films are presented.
Several Anderson films have a framing device. In the opening of The Royal Tenenbaums, we see the hands of a man checking out a library book by the same name. The film is divided into chapter segments, with a narrator guiding us — as if we are following along with a reading of the book. What we are seeing, then, is a visualization and an interpretation in the mind’s eye of those words (in that fictional book-within-a-film) and not something meant to be wholly the truth.
In Moonrise Kingdom, a seemingly all-knowing, tiny bearded character aptly named “Narrator,” guides the audience in the film. He clearly establishes the events we are about to view: the runaway love story of two preteens on a small New England island, which coincides with the arrival of a historic storm in the mid 1960s. This character is omnipresent, going as far as popping up to spew knowledge before events happen, and even physically interacting with the other characters.
Since the events have already happened, we may assume that this character is bringing us a mere retelling of those events. It is a rendition, in effect. He is like some bard telling a tall tale to a bunch of drunken folks down at a pub. Maybe he’ll over-pronounce some bits of the story just to make it that much more interesting and entertaining. Hence the bright colors and offbeat, only somewhat realistic ways in which the characters interact.
And then there is The Grand Budapest Hotel — where the Andersonian framing device is taken up a notch. The story, separated into six sections via title cards, begins in a rather subdued-looking (for Anderson) modern time: a young woman approaches the statue of a famed writer and then sits down in the park to read from the pages of perhaps his most lauded work… The Grand Budapest Hotel.
The book is a memoir, in which the author describes (we cut to a short scene of him in the ‘80s speaking to the camera) a time in 1968, when he stayed at the famous hotel and shared a dinner with the enigmatic, aging owner, Mr. Zero Mustafa. The mysterious Mustafa then recalls to the author the history of how the hotel ownership fell to him some 35 years earlier. Commence the main plot.
Let’s boil this down. A young girl is reading a book written in the ‘80s about a conversation the author had in the ‘60s, in which a story was told to him about events that happened in the ‘30s. Layers upon layers. Since the film opens and closes with the young reader, we can assume what we are seeing is her imagining of the events, as told by the author. This explains the distortion, drama, and expressionistic qualities of the visuals.
Not convinced? Well, think about our own human memory.
It is safe to say that the mental images brought up when telling a story, or reading a book, are not always the most realistic. For example, if you read a book where the author describes the birthmark of a character, one that looks a bit like Mexico, this image may become blatant and even over-pronounced in how we visualize them for the remainder of the book.
Think about all of the channels and layers The Grand Budapest Hotel is being told to us. Not only that, but in the film it is revealed that Mr. Mustafa is a semi-unreliable storyteller, leaving out some details about his relationship with the character Agatha, as it brings him too much pain to mention. What we are seeing is a distorted version of the events, not the true reality.
It cannot be disputed that Anderson is influenced by theatre. Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums and Moonrise Kingdom all either feature a theatrical production, a playwright character, or both within their stories. Regardless, the over the top ways in which his characters interact, as well as how they rapidly fire out dialogue all hint at this influence. (Note: Anderson met recurring actor Owen Wilson in a college playwriting class).
During Anderson’s studies of theatre, he may have stumbled upon Tennessee Williams (The Glass Menagerie, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof). The classic American playwright wrote about something he called Plastic Theatre, which was an expressionistic way of presenting a play through setting, props, music, sound and visual effects — everything adding up to parallel the emotional lives of the characters and theme. The world of the play reflects and transcends the story itself, rather than being plainly realistic.
Williams’ The Glass Menagerie is openly described as a memory play, the narrator Tom Wingfield guides us much like the bearded narrator from Moonrise Kingdom. He describes the story as having already happened, something in the past that he is recollecting. Here is an excerpt from the opening scene description.
“The scene is memory and is therefore non-realistic. Memory takes a lot of poetic license. It omits some details; others are exaggerated, according to the emotional value of the articles it touches, for memory is seated predominantly in the heart. The interior is therefore rather dim and poetic.”
Does this sound familiar? Here is a segment of Wingfield’s opening monologue, after he describes the social and historical background of the story:
“The play is memory. Being a memory play, it is dimly lighted, it is sentimental, it is not realistic. In memory everything seems to happen to music. That explains the fiddle in the wings. I am the narrator of the play, and also a character in it.”
Are Anderson’s films his interpretation of the memory play philosophy? Are they memory films?
I think that they are.

Coming off a heart-breaking defeat last week, the football team’s struggles continued as they lost to Northeast-10 Conference arch-rival American International College, 44-17, in a rematch of last year’s conference championship game, Saturday, Oct. 3, at Abdow Field in Springfield, M.A.
In the early moments of the second quarter, junior quarterback, Jeff Kidd, hoisted a 40-yard touchdown pass to red-shirt junior wide receiver, Shane Hubbard, hauling in his fifth touchdown of the season. The score put the Pioneers (3-2) ahead 7-6, but from that point on, things went downhill for the Green and Gold.
The Yellow Jackets (2-3) went on a scoring tear, as they tallied 24 unanswered points. Nothing went right for LIU, as Kidd threw two pick-sixes and the defense fell flat, giving up a 74-yard touchdown run putting the hosts in front 30-7 at halftime.
As the second half began, AIC continued to dominate and carried the momentum for the remainder of the contest. Turnovers and miscues cost the Pioneers, handing them their second straight defeat.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers return home Saturday, Oct. 10, to square off against Merrimack College. The Pioneers will host their annual Homecoming at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y. Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m.
“Homecoming is always great at LIU Post. The University does a great job in making it a special week,” Collins said.
Up until Saturday, all the Pioneer games have been decided by single digits, which goes to show how competitive the NE-10 is. “Merrimack is an aggressive and talented team with playmakers on both sides of the ball,” Collins said. “We need to win the third down battle on both sides of the ball and play good situational football.”
Collins also stated how Merrimack quarterback, Nick Davis, is a dual threat, so they need to make their offense more one-dimensional. “It’s great to play in such a festive atmosphere and in front of the alumni,” Collins added.
A couple of players shared their thoughts on Saturday’s game against Merrimack. “This game
is more important than regular games,” said Hubbard. “We need to make big plays and take care of business.”
Red-shirt senior linebacker, Brandon Cheney, filled in. “Saturday’s Homecoming game against Merrimack is huge and very meaningful,” Cheney said. “We need to go all out and give 100 percent because we suffered a devastating loss to them last year.”

Coming off an 8-0 win, which featured a four-goal effort from senior forward Susanne Vistnes earlier in the week, the Pioneers returned to the pitch on Saturday, Oct. 3, when they visited the University of Bridgeport. Their offense didn’t put up the outburst they saw earlier in the week; in fact, they didn’t manage a goal and lost by a score of 1-0.
The lone goal on the afternoon came from Bridgeport junior mid-fielder Hanne Neby in the 12th minute. The Pioneers managed a mere two shots on goal and also committed more penalties.
The Pioneers return to action on Monday, Oct. 12, when they welcome Southern New Hampshire University to Brookville, N.Y. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m.

The Pioneers played perhaps their best two matches of the season on Saturday, Oct. 3, when they won both in straight sets against Le Moyne College and Pace University.
In their first match against Le Moyne, the first set was tightly contested until five straight points set the tone for the match. The Pioneers won that set and the match handily. Sophomore outside hitter, Danielle Valenza, recorded 16 kills and nine digs while senior middle hitter, Melissa Hansen, added eight kills of her own.
In their next match against Pace, the first set played out very similarly to the first set against Le Moyne. Tied at 20, the Pioneers got key back-to-back blocks, which gave LIU a lot of momentum to win the set. The second and third sets that followed were more of the same for the Pioneers, who registered rally after rally and spurt after spurt and eventually the three-set victory.
Head Coach Shellane Ogoshi and the Pioneers are back in action on Saturday, Oct. 10, when they host Daemen College. First serve is set for noon.

It was all Pioneers on Saturday, Oct. 3, when the team traveled to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to face the University of Bridgeport. The Pioneers totaled six goals on the afternoon and cruised to an easy victory; giving them three in three chances in East Coast Conference play.
After an own goal gave the Pioneers the early advantage, senior forward, Per Forgaard, notched one of his two goals on the afternoon, beating the goalkeeper to make it 2-0 in favor of LIU. Sophomore forward, Jason Lampkin, assisted on the goal and did so on the next two as well. Sophomore back, Oliver Holingsaeter, and freshman forward, Charlie Ledula, were the recipients of those passes from Lampkin. Two goals in the second half made the margin of victory even larger and the Pioneers took the match by a score of 6-0.
Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and his team return to the pitch on Saturday, Oct. 10, when they return to Connecticut to play Post University. Game time is scheduled for 3 p.m.
