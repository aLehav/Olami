Students with a learning disability might be assigned a note-taker as a substitute for their own work. The note-taker is identified by the professor in the class and is employed by the Academic Resource Program.
Today, there are about 120 students taking advantage of the opportunity to have a note-taker. The program provides note-taking support services for students with hearing, visual, or motor limitations, or to those who have learning disabilities that significantly affect their abilities to take notes in class. By evaluating the students through a Diagnostic Evaluation Report, the university is able to decide whether or not they qualify for note-taking assistance.
The service is meant to act as a supplement to the qualifying students’ learning processes, as another person is assigned to write down the important points that are delivered during the class lectures.
Junior business management major Kathrine Andersen is a student note-taker, earning about $7.25 per hour for taking extensive notes. “You have to make sure you get everything the professor says,” she explains. If anything is unclear, she “googles” it, or she asks the professor to make sure her facts are correct. When class is over, the notes are submitted to the Learning Support Center, which distributes them further.
Andersen explains that it’s not too much extra effort to put in: “I take notes anyway,” she says. “The only difference is that, now, I take them on my computer instead of by hand.”
Anyone can become a student note-taker, as long as he or she makes sure to pick up on everything the professor says.
“Remember, someone is relying on your notes,” says Andersen. She appreciates that the university offers this kind of help; “Lecture notes can be reviewed by the student over and over at his or her own pace, so I think it is a good tool,” she says. For her own benefit, she finds that her job as a note-taker is paying off in a good way: “Besides helping a fellow student, it makes me attend every class, and I have to pay attention all through the class. Also, it pays for my coffee,” she says.

The Veterans Students United Club hosted its  “Women in the Military” program on Wednesday, November 9th, as part of the Veteran’s Appreciation Week. The goal of this event was to recognize women who have served or are serving in the military, to speak on the different roles women hold in the military, and to bring awareness to all that women have to deal with once they are involved with the military. VSU had the help of several clubs, such as the Latin American Women Society (LAWS), The Vikings Scandinavian Club, Men Respecting All Women/Women Appreciating Real Mean (MRAW/WARM), and Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated, for this event.
“I have been working with VSU for a year now, and I really enjoy it because it touches a place close to home for me. A lot of my family join the military, and I want to be able to give back in a way,” said Samantha Vega, VSU President and moderator of the “Women in the Military” program.
VSU Vice President Laura-Lyn O’Neil and Vikings President Elina Viitasaari were guest speakers. Both women were experienced in the military. O’Neil served in the United States Navy from 2001 to 2008 in California, and Viitasaari served in the Finland Air Force for a year. O’Neil spoke about women in the military, spotlighting the history women are making and the new strides they are taking every single day.
“Women have been a part of combat since the beginning of time in basic roles of nursing injured soldiers back to health. It wasn’t until the 1970’s that women were able to hold positions just like the men [are]. Women have been making strides in the military – branching out and doing things that are not expected of them today.  Women are even taking leadership roles in their sectors, which is very commendable,” said O’Neil.
Several women have received the Purple Heart medal, which symbolizes that they were wounded while in battle. One woman, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, received the Medal of Honor for her time served during the Civil War.
Viitasaari spoke about her experience as a military police sergeant and group leader in the Finland Air Force. “I joined the military to be able to get an education as well as to show that I am as strong as the boys,” said Viitasaari. She presented a slideshow that explained the Finnish military and the Finland v. Soviet Union Winter War and its hardships in terms of physical, mental, and weather challenges. “The best ways to get through these challenges are humor and laughter, friendship, and pride in yourself, and patriotism for your country. I love my country, and I would never bring shame to it,” Viitasaari said.
Another of the event’s guest speakers was Billy Achnitz of MRAW/WARM.  He spoke about the negative side of the impact of the military on women. Achnitz gave facts about women having to deal with being sexually assaulted or raped while serving the military. Women don’t get any type of “special treatment,” even though crime may be involved.  Female soldiers fear being labeled as  “troublemakers” within their units or being ridiculed or removed if they report any issues. Therefore, many cases are brushed under the rug and go unreported.
“I strongly believe that women should not have to deal with these fears,” stated Achnitz.  Often, sex offenders in the military get off with a reduction in their pays or a lowering of their ranks, he said. 80 percent of soldiers who do get convicted still get honorably discharged, he also explained.  In 2005, the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) was founded to track rapes and sexual assaults in annual reports, but, unfortunately, it is failing to actually prevent the crimes.
Many women in the armed forces have to struggle with discrimination and unfair treatment during and after their time served.  To help support this cause, do simple things like becoming an advocate for victims of sexual assaults or rape.  You can also visit stopmilitaryrape.org or volunteer at a Military Rape Crisis Center.

The Congressional Super Committee, which is composed of six Democrats and six Republicans, and was created by Congress to find a way to reduce the national debt, failed to come up with a plan to reduce the nation’s deficit over the next 10 years. Now, many programs, including the federal student aid program, are in jeopardy of being cut.
“Cuts to student aid programs are on the table. Proposals to cut Pell Grants and to eliminate the in-school interest exemption are especially troubling,” said Tony Pals, the director of communication for the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU).
On November 9, C.W. Post Provost Dr. Paul Forestell issued an email urging students to help save the federal student aid program by signing an online statement of support on the website studentaidalliance.org.
The federal government funds a small number of student aid programs. The largest program, the Pell Grant program, is facing most of the cuts, according to Jon Fansmith, the associate director for the American Council of Education. “Congress has eliminated the Year-Round Pell Grant, which provided additional Pell Grant support to students who attend school year round,” he added.
The Pell Grant is a federal program that provides need-based grants to low-income undergraduates. The maxim amount for the 2011-2012 award year is approximately $5,500. The Pell grant differs from a loan in which it does not have to be repaid. The Pell grant is available at 5,400 participating post-secondary intuitions including C.W. Post.
Approximately 28 percent of Post students receive Pell Grants and students are automatically processed to see if they qualify for the grant when they submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The proposed cut to the program will affect undergraduate students, graduate students and incoming freshmen.
The in-school interest exemption, which is a program that pays the interest on loans taken out by graduate and professional students while attending school, is in jeopardy. Also in danger are the incentives awarded to students who pay their loans on time.
Some federal student aid programs, according to Pals, that have already seen cuts this year include: Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP), TRIO programs, Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) Program, and graduate education programs. These cuts amount to more than $30 billion.
If the proposed cuts happen, students who are eligible to receive and have received the grants run the risk of receiving smaller Pell Grants.
Nicole Castellano, a senior English writing major, believes it’s a bad idea to cut the federal student aid program, “The students will suffer because they won’t be able to afford college. The colleges will suffer because they will lose students. Also, the economy will suffer because there will be less college graduates that will have special skills meant for the workforce,” she theorized.
A recent Georgetown University study determined that by the year 2018, there will be three million more jobs available to college graduates than there are college graduates to fill those positions, according to Fansmith. “We know that there is no better investment than a college education. More and more careers now require a post-secondary education.”
However, as the threat looms, students will probably need to depend more on borrowing money, working more while in school and actual assistance from the university or college they are attending.
Nicole Duckham, junior political science major, said she would probably need to pick up more hours at work if the cuts were to occur. “I think it’s ridiculous that Congress would cut federal student aid,” she said. “We’ve been talking about trying to have the most intellectual people studying here in the U.S. and producing the top people in math, science, etc. Yet, here we are thinking about cutting the federal aid that many students use to pay their tuition.”
Long Island University awards more than $200 million in financial aid and scholarships, university-wide, according to Rita Langdon, associate provost and director of Public Relations. The Long Island University/C.W. Post website states that 85 percent of Post students receive financial aid. Langdon claims that Long Island University is working with the Student Aid Alliance and the NAICU to protect the federal student aid program.
In a statement from Christopher A. Williams, the associate vice president for public policy, government and foundation relations at Long Island University, he stated that Long Island University is working with these organizations by engaging the Long Island University in e-advocacy efforts. These efforts result in the delivery of thousands of personalized email messages that are sent to elected officials and policymakers in Albany and Washington, D.C.
The Long Island University partnership with NAICU, includes letter-writing campaigns and targeted op-eds that support federal higher education programs.
“The government and university should work together to find a solution,” said Julio Pacora, an undeclared major. “There are many people in politics that talk about implementing and improving our education, but none of this will be possible if this cut to federal assistance turns into reality,” he added.
The fight to save federal aid continues on Capitol Hill where politicians are advocating for the program, according to Fansmith .
Congressman Steve Israel released the following statement to The Pioneer: “In order to out-compete China and create new jobs, we need to out-educate the rest of the world. Our federal student loan programs are critical support for students seeking higher education. I’ve been an ardent supporter of these programs and will continue to fight for them.”
The Communications Director for Congressman Timothy Bishop issued a similar statement of support. According to the statement, Congressman Bishop will continue to fight for the programs that make college more affordable for students without indebting them.
While Long Island University does provide assistance in the form of scholarships and grants, the fact is that the Super Committee has failed to reach an agreement. The failure means mandatory budget cuts for defense and discretionary spending—federal student aid is a discretionary program.
The federal student aid program is instrumental in helping to lessen the burden of paying for college and obtaining a degree. “If the federal student aid programs are protected, the future for college students nationwide will be bright. For students who enroll in higher education and earn a degree, it will be the best investment they ever make,” Pals said.
On November 18, the Student Aid Alliance provided the Super Committee with 100,000 signatures in support of the federal student aid program. However, because the committee failed to reach an agreement, the Student Aid Alliance is calling for more signatures.

On Thursday, November 17th, just before 8 a.m, 72-year-old criminal justice adjunct professor, John Carney was about to administer a test, until he walked out of his classroom in Lorber Hall to put his firearm on safety and, instead, accidentally shot himself in the leg.  Luckily, there were no students or faculty nearby when it went off.  Carney went back inside the classroom and asked for help from his students.  The students immediately dialed 911, and one student in the class, who had just been dropped off by her father, called her father to come back since he is a law-enforcement officer.  The professor was soon taken to a hospital to treat a wound to his right leg, where the bullet was lodged, and was released after a few days of recovery.   Students at C.W. Post received text messages from the Public Safety Alert System as well as e-mails to inform them about what had occurred.  While Carney is a retired Fire Marshall and is licensed to carry a weapon on him, C.W. Post enforces a strict no weapons policy on campus.
There are still many unanswered questions regarding the accident, including why Carney was carrying a weapon.  The Pioneer reached out to Carney but was informed that he did not wish to comment to The Pioneer or to any other news media.  The Pioneer then contacted the Chairperson of the Criminal Justice Department, Harvey Kushner, and he was quick to reply with “no comment” regarding the incident and the termination of Carney’s position.  Public Safety was also reached and asked for comments, but The Pioneer was then referred to the campus Public Relations Office, which provided a statement by C.W. Post’s Provost, Dr. Paul Forestell – a statement that had already been sent to the students by e-mail.  In the statement, Forestell emphasized that, “The University is committed to the safety and security of our campus community…C.W. Post policy explicitly prohibits the possession of firearms or other dangerous weapons on campus.  We will continue to enforce these policies to ensure the safety of our campus community.”
Students at C.W. Post have voiced a range of opinions.  Those who have had Carney as a professor describe him as an overall, nice man.  Senior Criminal Justice major Joao Siopa was one of Carney’s students. “I think Professor Carney is a great teacher. It’s unfortunate that something like this happened at our school. I don’t really think he should be punished for what he did. It was an accident. I understand that the school has a gun policy on campus, but he’s a retired fire marshal who’s made many arrests in his career, and I’m sure he’s made a few enemies along the way.”
Similarly, graduate student of Administration Andrew Jackson said, “Professor Carney is a good guy who made a big mistake, and he went out in the hallway to try to apply the safety, so he was definitely thinking about the students’ safety.”
Junior Criminal Justice student, Freddie Schwartz was on her way to class at Lorber Hall after the accident occurred. “I drove up there around 9:20, and I had no notification.  The lot was very empty, which was unusual.  I saw one of my classmates, and he told me that class was canceled and about what happened.  It was weird.  It is sad because he was a great teacher, and I hope he is ok.  I would have never known if he was carrying a gun.  I don’t think he should get fired because it was an isolated incident, and he didn’t hurt anybody.”
However, there are still many who question the actions of Carney, including senior Adolescent Education major Dominique Serpico. “Why does he have a gun on him on campus?” asked Serpico. “At least hold it in a safe box in the car or something, not walking around campus or in class with it.  After all these shootings at universities, you would think people would be a little more cautious.  It was an unfortunate, even, and, luckily, no other people were involved.”              While it is unfortunate that Post lost a professor who seemed to be very well liked by his students, Serpico affirmed that the safety of the campus comes first and that everyone, including faculty, must abide by the school’s no weapon policy.  Although there have been many school tragedies that were intentional in the past, the fact of the matter is that a firearm poses as a threat to anyone because accidents, like this one, can occur at any time.

A few decades ago, it was considered unfitting to publicly display the problems in your relationship. No one wanted to even admit that they were having any problems at all. It was all kept under wraps, a huge secret. Now, if you ask girls/guys about their relationships, they spew their problems at you like a faucet that you just can’t seem to turn off. Worse than that, couples are having all-out brawls publicly.
It seems to have become quite common in fact. Most groups of friends have that one couple that fights about anything and everything, just about everywhere the couple goes. I’ve seen it multiple times. You’re out with your friends and in the darkest corner of the bar or outside in the parking lot, there they are, having a screaming match about God only knows what.
My question is, why? That is the type of thing that is meant to be done at home. Not only are you ruining your night, you’re destroying the good time your friends are trying to have too. It’s typical for the guy to get pissed, go inside, and start pounding drinks at the bar like it’s his job; and the girl grabs her group of ladies and starts blubbering about how mean he is and he doesn’t understand her. Blah…Blah…Blah.
Save the drama for the soaps people. If you’re going to end up in a fight, please do the rest of us a favor and stay home. I apologize for the brutal delivery, but no one cares what you’re fighting about; we have our own issues to deal with. If you’re repeat offenders, I’m sure even your best friend doesn’t care at that point.
More than anything, it’s embarrassing. When I see couples fighting like that in public, I truthfully feel embarrassed for them because I’m conscious of how stupid everyone around them thinks they are. If you are reading this article and thinking to yourself, “OMG, we’re not that bad,” don’t fool yourself, it is that bad.

            By now, most people have heard about the Occupy movement sweeping our campus, state, the nation and the world. Nearly twenty movements have sprung up worldwide and are currently taking place. The movements are fighting for several things: government reform, worldwide democracy, job creation, and the sharing of wealth more evenly. These are all great things to fight for and things that everyone should be interested in, but has anyone noticed that the people who matter don’t seem to care?
Let’s focus on the United States of America for a quick second. When was the last time President Obama went on the air and acknowledged the Occupy movements? The local governments have been paying attention, but normally only to tell people to get up and go home. The Mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, announced that protesters have until this past Monday, November 28th, to clear out. In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg had Zuccotti Park cleaned out at one in the morning. They have stated that these measures are for everyone’s health and safety, which is understandable. They say that they are sympathetic to the cause, which may or may not be true, but either way they don’t show it properly.
The actions of these local governments indicate that they couldn’t care less about what the people want; they only care about the condition of the parks. But maybe everyone is going about this all wrong. Politics is about give and take, you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours. If all these local governments want the parks cleared and the movements to end, give them a reason for it to end, actually do something. If Mayor Bloomberg wants the movement to tone it down then he has to give them reason, start passing proposing legislation or taking the initiative to attempt a change that will help create jobs that will help distribute wealth. This is not something that is going to be healed overnight; it is going to take time and work on both ends.
As for President Obama, he needs to begin paying attention to what the people want. This is no longer a movement that is occurring in one place; it is nationwide, which means the federal government needs to start paying attention to it. Obama sits in the one seat that can actually propose ways to create jobs and he has yet to do so; he has yet to say anything on the Occupy movements at all. Congress itself hasn’t done anything either, and its members are the ones that can actually create the legislation in the first place. Maybe if there was an Occupy Washington D.C. movement they would care, maybe not. The problem is that all of these politicians, including Obama, get their money for their elections from these big businesses.
For now we just have to hope that someday someone will listen. Perhaps this is what America needs. These movements could cause the election of the next great president. All it takes is the right person to want to run and to care enough to start pushing for the changes that not only America needs, but the entire world. Only time can truly tell.

“Oh my gosh! Twilight!” millions of fans screamed as the doors opened at midnight on November 18th for part one of the saga’s finale, Breaking Dawn. Several people ordered tickets in advance when the box office began selling them last Tuesday. Dozens waited outside the Merrick Cinemas with blankets behind the stanchions for hours in 42-degree weather, then raced in trying to find the best seat possible.  Those who aren’t diehard Twilight fans may think “why is this so special?”
“Most boys don’t get it,” said Kelly Barratt, a junior Fine Arts major, “to us, it’s like their version of a new video game or superhero movie coming out, and what girl isn’t obsessed with Robert Patterson?”
When asked about the crowd outside the theatre, Steve Capone, a manager and shift supervisor at the Merrick Cinemas said “I don’t mind the crowd. But it’s kind of annoying to know that we’re getting paid the same as any other day. There are so many people here!”
Some oppose the next step in the saga, however. “I think it’s a fictionalized fantasy of what people want love to be, and that’s why I think it’s such a hit,” said Matt Marando, a senior English major. “ I personally think it’s stupid.”  This is a typical comment from a guy.
It appears the mystery will remain unsolved when it comes to trying to figure out why Twilight is so endearing to its fans. But just like any other major blockbuster, fans will continue to pile up outside the doors waiting for them to open.
“We’re completely sold out in all our theatres,” said Jeff Ianucci, another employee at the Merrick Cinemas, “I’m already nervous thinking about the madness part two will bring.”
So instead of asking fans what makes Twilight so special, a better question may be, “Are you team Edward or team Jacob?”

Penn State used to be thought of as a prestigious school with a good sports program and a pristine record when it came to allegations and scandals. Now, people think of Penn State as a disgrace to NCAA Division I football and a place where students have rioted freely in the streets.
Jerry Sandusky, former defensive coach of Penn State and founder of The Second Mile, a program for at-risk youth, was charged with sex abuse allegations late last month from a minor identified as “Victim 1”. The first allegation eventually led to more victims coming out, adding up to over 40 counts of alleged child sexual assault over the last decade. Victim 1 allegedly met Sandusky through the program, and slept at Sandusky’s house, where the sex abuse took place. Sandusky is currently free on $100,000 bail pending trial and faces life in prison if convicted. His final charges are as follows:
-7 counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, all 1st degree felonies punishable by up to 20 years in prison
-1 count of aggravated indecent assault, 2nd degree felony
-4 counts of unlawful contact with a minor, 1st degree felonies
-4 counts of unlawful contact with a minor, 3rd degree felonies
-4 counts of endangering the welfare of a child, 3rd degree felonies
-4 counts of endangering the welfare of a child, misdemeanors
-8 counts of corruption of minors, misdemeanors
-1 count of indecent assault, 3rd degree felony
-4 counts of indecent assault, misdemeanors
-2 counts of indecent assault, misdemeanors
-1 attempt to commit indecent assault, misdemeanor
Joe Paterno, the coach with the most wins in Division 1 football history and beloved head coach of the Nittany Lions for the past 46 years, was fired shortly after the Sandusky allegations became public. Although Paterno was not charged with any abuse, he allegedly had knowledge of Sandusky showering with boys and touching them in the showers, yet allegedly did almost nothing about it.  This in turn kept Sandusky around, and on campus, where he allegedly continued to abuse children.
When asked if what had been done to Joe Paterno was right, Matt McMahon, a freshman Broadcasting major said, “I honestly think he deserves it one hundred percent. He is pathetic for not getting done what should have been done. He’s referred to as a “role model.” It’s ridiculous he didn’t do enough about it.”
Nicholas Sesto, a freshman Bio Technology major, said “Turning a blind eye in a situation like that is a bad thing to do, but you can’t exactly put the actions of Sandusky on Paterno’s shoulders.”
Although Sandusky denies being a pedophile, he has been banned from Penn State campus, and his house has been vandalized. Many people are not convinced of his innocence; it’s hard to think of a jury being convinced either. What’s most astonishing is that the cover up went up and down the Penn State hierarchy from a University President, to a graduate assistant. I suppose we’ll have to wait and see what happens during the trial.

Have a question that you’d like answered? Send them in to The Pioneer’s email at cwpstpnr@gmail.com and get advice for all of your dilemmas.
 
Q: Part of my major requires me to complete an internship, but I don’t know where to start looking, or even WHEN I should be thinking of starting this process? Help. –A.C.
A: I think every college student can relate to this issue.  Most majors these days require students to complete at least one internship, if not more.  However, when many professors seem to believe theirs is the only class that we have homework for (and then multiply that by 4-5 different classes), how can a student find time to complete coursework, intern, and still have that all important social time?
Having balanced school, interning, and working while trying to maintain a social life myself, trust me, it definitely isn’t easy.  The key to success in all of this is to understand your limits.  If you are feeling particularly stressed with everything, you can’t be afraid to prioritize.  In most cases, you’ll most likely ending up cutting out time with your friends, but hey, when all your schoolwork is done, how much stress will be lifted off you?
As for when you should start the process of looking at and applying to internships, it is never too early.  There are plenty of sites and outlets where you can find information on the various positions.  Asking professors from your major about opportunities they know of will also help you to find the best fit for you.  The more research and effort you put into finding an internship, the more you’ll be able to find a position that really fits what YOU’RE looking for.
 
Q: I recently started seeing a guy that I really enjoy spending time with.  While things were moving along smoothly, with finals approaching he seems to be clinging to me more and more.  I have told him not to take the distance personally, that schoolwork (at least for now) has to come first.  However, he only is becoming more and more needy, what do I do? –A.G.
A: First, let me say, good for you knowing your schoolwork is paramount in this situation.  Now comes the hard part, making him understand this as well.  If your guy is a student at Post as well, then maybe reminding him that it’s finals time for his classes also might be a good nudge in the right direction.  If he still doesn’t take the hint, maybe you need to explain that a break is necessary during finals.  Without sounding abrasive I have to say, you should never let schoolwork, or work in general, suffer because of a relationship.  Let him know that it’s important to you that you do well in your studies, as it will affect your career.  He may not like this answer, but he certainly can’t argue against it.

One of the best parts of being in college is being able to go out on the weekends and indulge in the night life. Yes, there is life on campus but at the same time there is life off campus. I’ve been a student at C.W. Post for a few years and one thing I have learned is that sometimes you have to make your own fun, or you have to go out and find it. Long Island may not be anyone’s first choice to go out and be fabulous, but since we’re out here, why not try out these nearby bars and night clubs? (And don’t worry, I listed spots that accept ages 18 and up at all times!)
•      Barefoot Peddler – located at 37 Glen Cove Road | Greenvale, NY 11548 This bar is one of the best places to hang out with friends over the weekend whether you want to chill or watch a game. The drinks outnumber the appetizers and finger foods on the menu, not that we’re complaining about that. Also, the bartenders are very friendly; they usually will remember your name when you come back, and if you look like you’re over 16, you probably will have more fun than you’re allowed to have, if you catch my drift. I give this place five stars. Make sure you have the wings!
•      Club Avanti – located at 272 Post Avenue | Westbury, NY 11590 Formally known as Sambuca Nightclub, this has always been a hot spot for Post students to flock to, no matter what name it’s using. Maybe it’s just the address that is so appealing. The atmosphere, music and look of Avanti are all great, plus there’s a man who cleans the dance floor and clears up empty cups throughout the night. I felt bad for the guy, cleaning up after all these college students. Alcoholic beverages and hookah pipes are available at this club, but don’t try and be slick here. They do card you and are strict about it. I guess that’s why the name of the club changes so much? At least you get a free cup of water if you ask.
•      Club Giggles – located at 468 Peninsula Boulevard | Hempstead NY 11550 This night club is really spacious! This is a good thing, but later on I did some research on the venue and found out that it is actually a comedy club that is a part-time dance club, if people want to rent it out to hold a party.  That was interesting; I had wondered why it looked like it was someone’s house with a stage where the DJ was conveniently placed. This bar definitely will card you, and is a bit pricey, even for water.  The security is very strict at this place, so at least you would feel safe going to Club Giggles, but if you walk out to get a breath of air, you may not get back in, no joke.
•      Dublin’s Pub – located at 2002 Jericho Turnpike | New Hyde Park, NY 11040 Rumor had it that this is the place to go if 18 year-olds want to grab a drink. Rumor also has it that Dublin’s Pub is the hottest night spot on Long Island. I think and strongly believe neither is true. This place is cool for what it offers though: drinks, food, dance floor. The prices fit a college pocket as well, but the music and atmosphere may not make every person’s favorites list. However, I suggest trying it at least once with a group of friends.
•      Glo Nightclub – located at 737 Merrick Avenue | Westbury, NY 11590 Similar to Club Avanti, this club used to be Mirage Nightclub. Currently it has an alias, Club Halo. It all seems to work for this club because people can always find it and will keep coming. I think it is because of the breath-taking décor; it is probably the prettiest club in Nassau County. After Mirage closed, they did renovations and made changes for the better. The bar, music range, and security are all average when it comes to what you would expect to find at a college party. You may want to carry a few extra dollars if you plan on stopping at the eye-catching bar.
If you are looking for even more places to explore the Long Island Nightlife, check out Area 516 Nightclub located at 248 Front Street in Hempstead, or Crazy Donkey Bar located at 1058 Broadhollow Road in Farmingdale. All of these places have a lot to offer but no matter what, night life is only what you make it!

C.W Post is known as a commuter school, with close to 80 percent of the student population consisting of commuters. So, where do they live, and why do they choose to live off campus?
Political science major, and first year graduate student Kieran Mercer is a resident of Huntington Village. He appreciates the opportunity to have a life away from campus, and defines the place as “a town with character.” Mercer finds the cost of student accommodation on campus too high, and he views the off-campus living as a source to a more balanced life, “I really enjoy it. There is a lot to do in the town, but I don´t enjoy the commute,” he says.
Nick Falcone is a Business Management major living in Massapequa Park. He stays at home with his family, after living in the campus residence halls last year. “I’d rather live at home because I like sleeping in my own bed, and eating my family’s cooking, instead of Winnick,” he says. The town is located 25 minutes away, but Falcone doesn´t mind the trip. He finds living on campus to have both positives and negatives. “If you like being with friends all the time, and like having the convenience of going to the gym, the library and cafeteria whenever you want, then living on campus is for you,” he says.
Business management major Nicole Urbs lives in Bethpage with her parents, around a half-hour drive from C.W Post. “My parents were worried I would not get up for class, or get in trouble,” she says. With friends living on campus, she still gets to experience how it is living in dorms. “Although, since the dorms are very populated, they don’t have the silence like I do at home when I need to do my homework and cannot afford to get distracted by others,” she says, “I also enjoy having my own bathroom and my own room.”
Freshman Business Administration major Renee Pedersen is an international student living with her sister and her boyfriend in Hicksville, a 20-minute drive from campus. They chose to live off-campus because of the freedom, and the opportunity to live together. “It´s cheaper, and we have our own kitchen,” she explains.
Jazlyn Beltre is a junior Journalism major living in Corona, Queens, a 20-60 minute drive to school, depending on traffic. “I like living at home because it´s comfortable. There´s no moving in or out, and I can come and go as I please with guaranteed parking in my driveway and home cooked food,” she says. But living at home has its distractions: “The only things that get annoying are my two little brothers at the ages of two and four. They cry a lot sometimes, and make a lot of noise, which can be distracting,” she says. Beltre lived on campus last year, but with the high costs, she spent so much time working to pay for it, that she had little time to enjoy it. “With the economy the way it is, students should learn how to sacrifice. Living at home may be annoying sometimes, but it will help your pockets in the long run,” she says.

Holiday season is finally here, which means presents, family, and of course, great food. A nice way to show appreciation towards family members during the holiday season is to bring along a tray of desserts or a side dish to share with everybody. Whether you need suggestions on what to bring to your family member’s house, or you just need a few ideas on some food dishes, here are some options.
Corinnna Sacchetta, a junior  Speech Pathology major, has a recipe for apple  cinnamon muffins.  These are a delicious winter snack that is perfect for the holiday season.  Here’s what you need:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (whole wheat or white) 3/4 cup white sugar 1/2 tsp salt  2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1/3 cup vegetable oil 1 egg 1/3 cup milk 2 apples – peeled, cored, & chopped  topping: 1/2 cup white sugar 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup butter cubed 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
 
How to make them:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease muffin cups or line with muffin liners. Stir together 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, salt, baking powder and 1 tsp cinnamon. Mix oil, egg, and milk. Fold in apples. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling to the top of the cup. In a small bowl, stir together the topping ingredients and sprinkle over unbaked muffins. Bake in preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffin comes out clean.
Professor Veronika Dolar, an Economics professor from Slovenia shared a recipe for goose with the Pioneer.  In Slovenia the people celebrate a holiday called St. Martin’s day.  It is a tradition on this day to eat goose.  Trying new foods this season is a great way to get into the holiday spirit!
Ingredients:
2 kg goose or duck salt and paper to taste 1 tablespoon oregano, chopped fine 2 to 3 apples, peeled and cut fine 1 cup roasted Italian chestnuts, chopped and divided into two ½ cup portions 1 cup water 1 bottle of beer 1 tablespoon spice mixture (try to find Vegeta or Začinka) 1 tablespoon starch 2 tablespoons bread crumbs
Procedure:
Wipe goose or duck with damp paper cloth inside and outside and rub all over with salt and pepper. Let it stand overnight. Mix well apples, ½ cup of chestnuts, and bread crumbs and stuff the goose or duck. Sew up the cavity. Pour some water in the roaster, cover with a rack and place the goose or duck on it. Roast in 350° oven for about 90 to 120 minutes. Baste and turn it occasionally. Finally, when the goose or duck is brown, sprinkle it with mixture of beer and a pinch of salt. The skin becomes crispy. Remove the goose or duck, sift the gravy and bring it to a boil. Add ½ cup chestnuts, spice mixture and some broth and thicken gravy with starch. Mix well.
 
Staci Palacino, a freshman Childhood Education major, eats seafood on Christmas as a tradition.  Her favorite meal is flounder stuffed with crabmeat.
Here is the recipe:
6 slices of flounder
3 cups of Pepperidge Farm herb seasoned stuffing mix
4 tbl. butter
1 large onion chopped
2 stalks of celery chopped
1 16 oz of lump crabmeat
sauce:
4 tbl butter
2 teas garlic powder
1 cup white wine
paprika
 
How to prepare it:
Clean and set aside flounder. In large pan sauté butter, onions and celery until soft. Add water according to package of stuffing mix, using 3 cups of stuffing. Follow directions on package to make the stuffing. When ready, add the crab meat and mix lightly.  Taking the flounder add about 2 tablespoons of stuffing mixture to center of flounder and roll. Place in a glass oven safe dish using Pam non stick spray on bottom.  Continue to do all pieces. In small pot on stove melt 4 tbls butter, 2 teas. garlic powder and 1 cup of white wine. Simmer for few minutes, then pour over flounder. Sprinkle with paprika…cover in foil and bake on 350 for 20 to 30 minutes or until flounder is cooked and flakey.
 
Lastly, my personal favorite holiday dessert is oreo truffles.  They are extremely easy to make, and they serve as a great gift! All you need is 1 package of oreo cookies, 1 package (2 squares) of cream cheese, and melted chocolate.  In order to make them, keep the cream cheese at room temperature, mash the oreos into crumbs using a food processor, and then mix the oreos into the cream cheese and roll it all together into little balls.  Keep the balls in the freezer, and if you wish you can dip them into melted chocolate to make your truffles look extra delightful.
Make this holiday season even better by cooking and trying new things.  Happy Cooking!

An almost compulsory part of the college experience is going out and partying on the weekends. Naturally, we all want to look our best when we do so. However, we do not want to forgo our dignity and personal style for something short, tight, and trashy. When you look great, you feel great. And who among us does not want that? I have created four simple and effortlessly-glamorous outfit combinations to meet your going-out needs.
The Bombshell: This outfit choice is perfect for the bold, brave, and confident girl who wants to strut her stuff and make an entrance. Rock the Open Back Lace Dress from BeBe in either crimson or black. With its peek-a-boo lace back, this outfit is a classy way to show your sultry side. The lace goes down to the middle of your back so you are covered in all the right places. From the front, this dress appears to be a simple and gorgeous form-fitting dress, but the detailed back offers a distinct way to display your personality. Add a simple pair of black pumps to elongate and slim the legs, and you’re ready!
The Trendsetter: The 70s are a huge trend this season so don a black Jersey Wrap Jumpsuit like one from the Kardashian Kollection and an awesome pair of statement wedges like leopard print ones by Steve Madden. This adds a pop of print and personality to an otherwise simple, classic outfit. This jumpsuit is tailored and flattering while maintaining a certain level of comfort so you can dance the night away. If you are feeling particularly trendy, add a fur vest to go with the ensemble.
The Rocker: This much more casual but put-together-look is perfect for a dinner out with your girlfriends or even a night at the bar. Begin with a distressed black or brown faux-leather jacket. Mix in a neutral-colored blouse or button up shirt to add a more feminine touch. Put on your favorite pair of skinny jeans, such as a pair from the Gap, and finish the outfit off with a pair of knee-high black or brown motorcycle-style boots. This outfit juxtaposes edginess with femininity.
Casual Cutie: For those of us who are more reserved, this is the option. Off-the-shoulder tunic tops are a great way to show some skin while leaving a little to the imagination. Tops such as this can be found anywhere from Victoria’s Secret to Target.
Find a colorful one that compliments your skin tone and slip on a pair of trusty leggings. Feeling a little more adventurous? Opt for leather, velvet, or liquid leggings instead of cotton or jersey ones. Complete this outfit with a comfortable yet fashion-forward pair of flats.
“My biggest pet peeve about what girls wear is the fact that they are not wearing anything at all,” asserts senior Journalism major Kathleen Joyce. “You need to leave something to the imagination. I am all for tight clothes, but I am also for wearing clothes period. My favorite things to wear are nice sweaters, blouses, and heels since I am short.”
“Whether going out on a date or hitting the town with the girls, no matter what you wear, it is always important to feel confident,” says senior Public Relations major and Journalism minor Alexandra LaRocca. “My favorite store is Express because it has clothes perfect for any occasion: going out, business attire, and even just for every day at school. Although it can be a little pricy, it has great sales and the clothes last a long time, so you get your money’s worth.”
No matter what your style or confidence level, the best accessory you can wear is a smile. Strut your stuff and own it. Check out Express, H&M, BeBe, and other similar stores to create the perfect night-on-the-town look for you.

So this may seem funny now, but at the time it was important. A few days ago, a guy I have a bit of a crush on, we’ll call him Sam, was going to travel with me, in my car, to a local party. I suggested the idea because I wanted to spend some time alone with him before the party. But after I said it and he accepted, I panicked. This would mean I would have to clean the car, put it into tip-top shape. With only a few hours, I had to work fast. So here are a few tips to make your car jealous-worthy in an hour or shorter.
The first thing I did was go to my local car-wash and spend $10.00 to get it washed on the outside and a brief vacuuming on the inside. (Sorry, but did you really think I was going to wash my car in the cold? No, I didn’t like this guy that much.) At the car wash I picked up a few Refresh! Your Car Air Fresheners in Pina Colada for $1.99. Since we were going to be drinking that night, might as well start early.
After my car smelled decent, I closed up my cup-holder, since it’s coffee stained, put my water-proof mats on the floor, since it rained that night, and dusted my dashboard, just so he wouldn’t get the sniffles. I also threw out any garbage, old homework, and fast-food receipts. I cleaned the windows and admired my work. The car got my seal of approval and I was ready to go. And the car wash had taken close to 15 minutes, and the dusting and organizing  was only another 15 minutes. In all, a half hour and $12.00 was spent to make my car look like the beauty it can be. Now I had to get ready!
While driving there I wondered should I just drive the way I always do, or be more cautious? Should I make it seem like I am a good driver, or just drive like the maniac I can be when I’m anxious or excited? So while talking and driving, I relaxed and decided that I was just going to drive the way I normally do. Cleaning my car was already respectful enough, why should I change my driving habits because of him? He didn’t seem to mind, and we had a good time that night. He even commented on how neat I kept my car. Who says first impressions aren’t important?

While a lot of people are saying Breaking Dawn, Part 1, is the best installment of the Twilight Saga, I beg to differ. While it certainly is the most emotional, the story could have definitely fit into one movie.
The film began with the wedding scene, and within the first fifteen minutes, half the movie theatre was balling, including myself. The scene was completely on point. For those of you who have read the series, you can rest assured; the wedding was not altered.
Any Twihard knows that the scene every- one was waiting for is when Bella and Edward consummate their marriage, AKA the steamy sex scene. Being rated PG-13, I was a little nervous on how this scene would be orchestrated. To my surprise, however, it was pretty raunchy. They even left in the part when Edward breaks the headboard – wink. The rest of the movie kind of goes south
from there. Besides the acting being border- line horrible, the honeymoon takes half an hour, when it could have been done with in 15 minutes. Scenes are filled with Edward and Bella playing chess – yes chess.
Soon Bella senses something wrong and has to return from her and Edward’s honey- moon. To everyone’s surprise, she is pregnant with a hybrid vampire baby. For the rest of the film Bella battles the child as it physically destroys her. It gets very gory at parts, and the audience is subjected to seeing Kristen Stewart wither away to just bones.
Overall, Breaking Dawn wasn’t bad. It is certainly not the best of the series, however, it is certainly worth something if it can bring an entire theater to tears.

“Man Up!”
ABC
 
What does it really mean to be a guy anymore? That’s the question that best friends Will (Mather Zickel), Craig (Christopher Moynihan), and Kenny (Dan Fogler) ponder. Sensitivity is the reason why Mike’s wife, who is also Kenny’s sister, Theresa (Teri Polo), married him. Meanwhile, Kenny’s ex, Brenda (Amanda Detmer), who is friends with Theresa, has begun dating Grant (Henry Simmons). The men eventually attempt to put their differences aside and hang out with each other as they try to live up to the men who came before them.
It is chuckle-out-loud hilarious, as these friends search for their identities and try to prove that “real men” don’t have to be so tough. Kenny gets jealous when Will and Grant strike up an unlikely “bromance.” The guys attend a “Star Wars” screening that doesn’t go as planned. Craig lands a music gig, which backfires. Theresa then installs a tracking device on Will’s cell phone.
It’s great to see a show created by and starring Christopher Moynihan premiere alongside other shows. His previous sitcom, “100 Questions,” was scheduled as a midseason replacement last year. It aired after the season completed, signaling immediate cancellation.
“Man Up!” airs at 8:30 p.m. on Tuesdays following “Last Man Standing” on ABC.

“Belong to Me” by Marisa de los Santos
“Sometimes, happiness feels so fragile…So, what do we do about it?…Live. Forget that it’s fragile. Live like it isn’t” ― Marisa de los Santos, Belong to Me
“Belong to Me” is Marisa de los Santos’ second novel, and it captures the attention of the reader from the very first page.  Although it is a sequel to her New York Times Bestseller  “Love Walked In,” you do not necessarily need to read that one in order to appreciate this novel. The chapters are written from the perspective of three varying characters: Cornelia, Dev, and Piper. The tales of these characters’ lives and how they all tangle together make it an instant page-turner.
Cornelia Brown, the main character, had just gotten married to the love of her life, Teo, and hesitantly moved away from the city life that she has grown to know and love in order to settle down in the suburbs.  As she starts this new chapter of her life, she meets her new neighbor, Piper.  Right off the bat, Cornelia deems her to be a stereotypical, wealthy and shallow suburban housewife.  As the plot progresses, Piper’s best friend, Elizabeth, is diagnosed with cancer, and she puts her perfect life on hold in order to care for her friend. This is a huge turning point in Piper’s life because she realizes that things are not always perfect and, therefore, tries to live a more genuine lifestyle.
In the meantime, Cornelia has met a woman that she can actually relate to, Lake. The two share a love for classic movies and literature and a distaste for Piper (who Lake has nicknamed “Viper”); it is the type of friendship in which they feel they have known each other forever. However, what Cornelia does not know is that Lake is hiding a very big secret. Lake’s son, Dev, is a child genius, and he actually becomes the first boyfriend of Cornelia’s pseudo-daughter, Clare.
Friendships grow; lies are told, and secrets come out, but the main theme of the novel is how the love we have for some people is so strong that they simply just “belong to us”. This book is rated 5 out of 5.

Now being a film major I might get chastised for this review, but I don’t really care because its my opinion so here goes. I Thought the Movie was really good, however, the acting wasn’t academy award winning. The focus of the film is on a man named Theseus, a peasant who is chosen by Zeus to lead the fight against the merciless King Hyperion.
Hyperion is laying waste to all of Greece to obtain the Epirus Bow, an infinite weapon created by Ares who, if you don’t know Greek mythology, is the God of War. I Feel as if the story was well written, although some things were predictable I still feel as if the movie flowed smoothly from scene to scene.
Now here’s where things get interesting. I’m usually anti 3D, I hate 3D, however, the fact that the movie theatre didn’t even offer it regular, was outrageous. This particular movie in 3D was awesome. The action & fighting scenes were epic, better than the movie 300, to which this movie uses a similar style. The Greek Gods kick ass, when they do decide to get involved in mortal affairs.
This movie takes the slow motion fight scene to a whole new, intensely Gory Level. As an avid fan of gory slow motion fight scenes, the movie made me feel like a kid again. I think that’s the purpose, I can’t say much about the cinematography since most of the backdrops were probably CGi (Computer Generated imaging) but if I had to comment on it, to put it simply, it looked like 300. If your Expecting Anything but a kick-ass action movie then don’t go see iMMORTALS otherwise go see it immediately, it was definitely worth the $15 to see it in 3D. I give the movie an 8/10 and definitely recommend you see it.

The C.W. Post Pioneers women’s basketball team has picked up where it left off last season. After losing the season opener to Philadelphia University, the Pioneers have gone on a five-game winning streak, with the latest victory coming over the Felician College Golden Eagles by a score of 82-56 on Sunday, November 27th.
The Pioneers and Golden Eagles played neck-and-neck before the Pioneers pulled away with the lead. Felician’s senior center Jessica Ford tied the game at 10 on a free throw with 13:19 left in the first half. But, after that, the Pioneers went on a 10-0 run, highlighted by three pointers by sophomore guard Kenyatta Sears and graduate forward Catherine Lutz.  By the end of the first half, the Pioneers had accumulated a 40-27 lead.
The second half was a similar story, with the Pioneers dominating play. Junior center Samantha Kopp led the team in points in the second half, putting up 12 points while grabbing eight rebounds. Sears put up nine points of her own in the half, giving the Pioneers a threat from beyond the arc all game long.
The Pioneers scored 42 points in the second half to make it an 82-56 victory.
Sears put up 21 points in the game while securing six steals and two assists. The Pioneers shot 33 percent from the field (24-71) and 26 percent from three-point range (5-19).
Prior to the victory, the Pioneers defeated Caldwell College, 79-70, Adelphi University, 64-59, Nyack College, 84-55, and University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, 81-68.  Their only setback was on November 12th, against Philadelphia University, when they lost 81-66.
The Pioneers’ next game will be their home opener on Wednesday, November 30th, against Dowling College. The game tips off at 5 p.m.

The C.W. Post men’s basketball team has won two consecutive games, defeating Bloomfield College 90-82 and Felician College 92-78. With the two wins, the Pioneers’ record moves to 4-1, with their only loss occurring on November 16th, to Chestnut Hill College by a score of 93-80.
In their most recent game against the Felician Golden Falcons on November 27th, the Pioneers did not get off to a quick start. During the first half of play, there were an abundance of foul calls, dramatically slowing down the pace of the game. However, during the final handful of minutes of the first half, senior guard Stefan Bonneau found his rhythm, knocking down shot after shot. Bonneau scored 12 points in the half to help give the Pioneers a 47-39 advantage at the break.
The Pioneers started off the second half better with good ball movement and solid defense. Junior guard Tobin Carberry led the Pioneers in scoring with 23 points on 6-9 shooting from the floor and 3-4 shooting from the perimeter. In addition, late in the game, Carberry showed off some of his high-flying abilities with an incredible finish of an alley-oop that put the crowd in a frenzy.
Senior point guard Terry Coleman had an impressive showing in all facets of the game. Coleman scored 18 points while missing only one shot the entire afternoon. He made a couple of difficult running shots and was a perfect 4-4 from three-point range. His defense was also spectacular, breaking up several passes, and he also managed to dish out five assists.
Carberry and Coleman stepped up their play down the stretch when Bonneau left the game with about ten minutes left due to cramps. Sophomore forward Vaughn Allen played well in the win, attaining a double-double scoring 11 points and snatching 10 rebounds.
The Pioneers’ big lead of as much as 19 points was cut to eight points during the final two minutes of play. However, the Pioneers sank their free-throws and won with a double digit victory, 92-78.
The Golden Falcons’ senior center John Tello led the game in scoring, as he dropped 29 points on 11-21 shooting, while also showing some outside range, nailing four three-pointers.
One of the most crucial statistics was the success from beyond the arc for both teams. The Pioneers were able to hit the three-point shot at ease, nailing 12 of their 20 attempts (60 percent). On the other hand, the Golden Falcons as a team, with the exception of Tello, struggled as they successfully made only eight of their 21 attempts (38 percent).
The next game for the Pioneers comes on Wednesday, November 30th, against Post University in Waterbury, Connecticut, at 7 p.m. Last season, the Pioneers split their two games against the Post Eagles, as both teams won on their home courts.

The C.W. Post women’s swim team defeated the Army Black Knight on Friday, November 18th, by the score of 135-123. The close win brought the Pioneers’ record to 3-0 to start the season. One school record and six pool records were set in addition to two personal bests.
Junior Sandra Luiga set the school record, taking first place in the 400 individual medley with a time of 4:38.14. The previous record, 4:40.49, was set by Katie Kelly in December 2007.
The six pool records that were broken included four individual records and two relay records. Sophomore Tamara Garriock set two of the individual records herself. She won the 200 free with a time of 1:53.22 and the 200 breaststroke with a time of 2:21.62 to set a new bar for swimmers in the Pratt pool. Senior Cornelia Hanes set a pool record in the 50 free with a finishing time of 24.02, and junior Mairi Morrison set the record for the 100 free, touching the wall in 52.35 to round out the individual pool records.
In the relay events, Luiga, Garriock, Hanes, and Morrison joined together to swim a 3:56.08 400 medley relay, breaking the previous record that had been set two years ago by a team that also included Hanes. Garriock, Morrison, Hanes, and freshman Courtney Delehanty broke a pool record that had stood for almost four years in the 200 free relay, completing the race in a time of 1:36.05.
Freshman Catriona Laird and senior Sandra Kirstein walked away from the meet with personal bests in the 100 fly to finish up the day for the Pioneers.
The team will be back in the pool this weekend, December 3rd and 4th, when it participates in the College of New Jersey’s Winter Invitational in Ewing, New Jersey.

How long have you been swimming for the C.W. Post swim team?
I have been on the swimming team since the fall of 2009.
 
What made you choose Post?
I got a great feel for this place when I came on my recruiting trip. The coaching style and the coaches seemed to fit me; plus, it was just outside of New York City.
 
How do you feel about Post now?
I like Post; I still think it was the right choice for me.
 
What lesson(s) will you take from Post?
I will take many lessons with me.  I have grown as a swimmer, a student and a person. To name just one would not be fair.
 
What is the best memory you have with the team?
My freshman year, when we won all the relays in our conference and made the cut times to qualify for the NCAAs.
 
How do you feel Post has prepared you for your future?
As a student athlete, you learn how to balance swimming with school, so I am very disciplined, and I know how to get through a busy schedule. School wise, I have learned so much within my subjects that I feel ready to take on the world.
 
What do you want to do after you graduate from Post?
After I graduate, I want to move to California to either start my master’s or to do my OPT year; it is not set in stone yet.
 
How does it feel to have set so many school records?
It feels great! Hard work pays off.
 
What will you miss the most from Post?
My teammates…without a doubt, my teammates; they become your family here.
 
Cornelia Hanes has been swimming for the C.W. Post swim team for the last three years.  In the 2010-2011 season, Hanes was named All-American Honorable Mention in the 100 Free, and 200 Medley Relay, as well as in the 400 Medley Relay and the 200 Free Relay.  She was also named All-American Honorable Mention in the 2009-2010 season at the NCAA Championship.  Hanes holds four school records at Post; one for the 50 Free, another for the 400 Medley Relay, and two more in the 200 and 400 Free Relays.  The Pioneers are currently 3-0 in their season.  The team’s next meet will take place December 3rd-4th at the TCNJ Winter Invitational in Ewing, New Jersey.
