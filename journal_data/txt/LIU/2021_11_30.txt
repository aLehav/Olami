Emotional support animals have become increasingly popular among college students in the last few years. The idea of having a pet as means of emotional support, and helping someone get through something, has become more common in recent years.
As of 2019, there were 200,000 emotional support animals in the United States, many of which are dogs. This number is up exponentially since 2014, when there were only 2,400. They are classified as service dogs, since they are used to assist people with their mental health.
When a puppy is trained to be an emotional support animal, the training can take anywhere from 14 to 24 months.
Certain emotional support animals, classified as psychiatric service dogs, can only be obtained by individuals who fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
However, any other person can obtain a regular pet that can double as their emotional support animal.
“An emotional support animal to me is a pet that comforts you through your trials and tribulations. Emotional support animals help with academic stress, as well as depression and anxiety that comes from coursework throughout the semester,” junior theatre arts major Gabriella Beckman said. 
Many college students feel anxiety and elevated stress throughout their semesters, and feel that emotional support animals could help.
Post currently allows students to have emotional support animals. According to liu.edu, “It is LIU’s policy to permit Service Animals, as defined below by the Americans with Disabilities Act, in all approved campus areas; and it may permit Emotional Support Animals (Support Animals), as a reasonable accommodation, in the residence halls for students with a documented disability.”
“They help with stress, anxiety, and just managing emotions,” sophomore nutrition and dietetics major Amanda Battista said.
Emotional support animals can be a tool for anyone who has a psychological disorder and needs an emotional companion, as well as just the average person looking to have a stress reliever in their life.
“I feel as though an emotional support animal could help me tremendously. Whether it be the support animal sensing an anxiety attack, or just taking a break from life to just be with your support animal, it would help,” Beckman said.
Beckman and others agree that emotional support animals should be allowed in college dorms because of the support and aid they can give students.
“I love them. I would say that they should be allowed as long as they are specifically trained to be an emotional support animal,” Batista said. “They would have to go through special training where they are taught to understand human emotions, as well as not bark and disrupt other students in the dorms. I think there should be a separate dorm section for them, and that some sort of doctor’s note should be used as well.”
In today’s age of mental health awareness, emotional support animals are being touted as a tool to help not only the depressed, but also the average person.
“Honestly, the campus should have emotional support animals for everyone. It’s proven that they help people control their emotions and just relax,” Battista said.
With the popularity of emotional support animals continuing to rise, many questions arise, such as how schools will react to and accommodate an influx of students bringing emotional support animals to college with them.
Many also wonder how other institutions will react to people having emotional support animals.
The U.S. Army does not allow emotional support animals on military bases because they are not classified as service animals. However, if a soldier lives in their own apartment, they can have any type of pet they want.
Many questions will arise in the following years about how accessible emotional support animals should be to the public, as well as where they should be allowed. It is up to institutions to decide how these animals should be accepted.

Many people are shocked to hear the news about Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian’s new relationship. The two have been seen hanging out and many struggle to picture them together.
Now that Kardashian and Kanye West are split, Kardashian has moved on and is allegedly hanging out with Davidson. 
“It is really hard to picture them together and I am not sure how long the relationship will last since they both live such different lives,” sophomore biology major Elizabeth Lebeshova said. 
On October 9th, 2021, on SNL, Kardashian and Davidson shared a kiss and many were speculating that the two may be in a budding relationship. 
Although many saw the kiss as the start of this relationship, the Kardashian camp source had made it clear that nothing happened that week between them and they were just friends at that point. 
“I feel like the two are definitely an unlikely pair and they have two completely different personalities so I think that’s why it is so difficult to see them together,” sophomore nursing major Anna Polcini said.
The Kardashian camp source has also told the press that the two became close when Davidson went to LA and the two went out with a group of mutual friends. 
The rumors of the two being together grew after they were seen holding hands on a roller coaster at Knott’s Berry Farm. 
Later in the same week, Davidson had arranged for the two to have a private dinner together on the rooftop of a restaurant.
“Pete is definitely trying his best to do nice things for Kim while still maintaining a private relationship and avoiding the rumors being increased,” Lebeshova said.
During the rooftop dinner, the pair were able to sneak out the back of the restaurant in order to avoid the press. 
Although the two are trying to keep their relationship out of the public eye, reporters and cameras continue to find them on their get-togethers.
Celebrities often have a difficult time keeping their romantic relationships private, just like Kardashian and Davidson. 
Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes had recently decided to draw an end to their relationship that had lasted about 2 years. Instead of dealing with this hard time on their own, they came to the conclusion that they should share this shocking information with their fans by making an announcement on social media. 
“It’s possible that Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes found it easier to just tell their fans what is going on instead of seeing all of the posts about suspicions of them breaking up,” sophomore business major Lauren Ritirato said.
Many believe that Kardashian and Davidson are trying to be seen together to gain popularity and be relevant in celebrity reports.
“It is hard to say whether or not the two are together for the publicity or if they actually like each other and want to be together,” Polcini said.
Other sources have also seen Kardashian and Davidson together in New York City and they appeared to be acting very affectionate.
“This couple was very unexpected and it makes me wonder whether or not they are dating for publicity, considering the fact that Kim and Kanye are now separated,” sophomore business major Gabrielle Selter said. 
Many are thinking that the two are pretending to fall for each other in order to keep their names in the press, while others believe that the two genuinely like each other and support Kardashian and Davidson.

Lana Del Rey’s eighth album “Blue Banisters” was released on Oct. 22. According to Billboard, “Blue Banisters” has already reached the #1 spot on the Alternative Album Chart. 
Lately, Del Rey has been working nonstop on her music career with this album being the second one she has released within the year, with the first one being “Chemtrails Over the Country Club,” an album that made Del Rey fans go through a series of emotions.
Del Rey is an artist with a reputation of being problematic and her behavior has been in the news more than her music. According to senior musical theatre major Gabby Lavoie, who has been a fan of Del Rey since she was 12 years old, she usually doesn’t want to separate the art from the artist but she believes Del Rey has good intentions.
“From a fan standpoint, I want to say that she comes from a good place and that she oversteps from where she’s coming from, however it’s hard to say that because I don’t personally know her. With that being said, with her, I do try to separate the music from the artist even though I don’t like doing that for other people, ” Lavoie said.
Lavoie was surprised that Del Rey released two albums in the same year, but she thinks that it was easier for her because a lot of her music sounds similar.
“Something that I really like about her music is that you’re going to get a little bit of the same thing and I think that because her music is usually always similar then it’s almost easier in a sense to release two albums,” Lavoie said. 
However, Lavoie admitted that this album was not her favorite.
“I liked the album “Norman Fucking Rockwell” a lot more than this album and I believe that Blue Banisters felt a little rushed,” she said.
Some believed that this was her best album yet. According to sophomore Charli Cohen, who hasn’t been a fan of Del Rey long, “Blue Banisters” tells a story of a past relationship. 
“I like “Blue Banisters” because of how she opens up about her recent relationship with a police officer from Oklahoma. And I feel like in this album she’s sharing who she truly is and it’s beautiful,” Cohen said. 
Cohen and Lavoie both agree that holding an artist accountable is important and even though they are both fans of Del Rey, some of the problematic comments she makes, as well as her “Question for the Culture” Instagram post in July 2020, are just not okay. Both agree that when Del Rey deleted her social media accounts fairly recently, it was the best thing for her.
“I think that making the decision to delete her social media accounts was probably a smart thing because Lana is going to do what Lana wants and staying off of the media will prevent that,” Cohen said.
