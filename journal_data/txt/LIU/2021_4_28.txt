Post-alum and self-taught fashion designer Melissa Mercedes has been nominated for the Cultivate award which supports the next generation of BIPOC indie designers in the plus-size fashion community.
Mercedes has had a love for fashion since a young age and remembers sharing sketches with her grandmother at seven years old.
“I’ve always loved to draw so I would just start drawing dresses and I would give it to my grandmother since she was a designer and I would say I want you to make me this dress,” Mercedes said. “She was blown away at the fact that I was kind of showing interest so she would take me to the fabric stores and let me pick out the fabrics for whatever design I wanted to make and she would give me certain ideas. She encouraged me the most.”
However Mercedes’ life took a different path from fashion, she graduated from LIU with a degree in school counseling and was working at a nonprofit organization.
“I was doing counseling and I was working at a nonprofit organization alongside youth and one of my responsibilities was to do job readiness and teach students how to speak at a job interview and how to dress,” Mercedes said. “Different designers would send us clothing to give to these underprivileged kids and my job was to take the wardrobe that we got and show these kids how to dress for job interviews.” This sparked the same passion for clothes Mercedes had as a kid and helped her find her way back to fashion. 
“Once I saw the transformation of how clothes can make someone feel so empowered I just kind of fell in love with that process and I had always loved fashion and styling friends but that was the first time that I was like wait a minute I think I can make a career, I think I can really do this,” Mercedes said. 
Styling came naturally to Mercedes as she had been styling her friends and family her whole life. 
“I would just do it for fun, it was something I always did, didn’t think anything of it. It was if my friends wanted fashion advice they would come to me, like how does this look or they would send me pictures or what do I wear so it became very natural. I took that seriously first, I kind of started to turn that into a career, and I created a company called Retro Boho Chic and I started styling and that was when I was invited to the Grammys and so I went.” 
In 2016 Mercedes was invited to the Latin Grammys to style a musician as well as attend herself. Her excitement for the event was short-lived when she realized she didn’t know what to wear. 
“I couldn’t find anything to wear so I went to every store and tried on everything and I just remember crying in the fitting room and saying ‘oh my god if this is how I feel I can’t imagine how other women feel’,” she said. “So I just went to the fabric store, picked out what I liked, figured out what I wanted, had it made, and walked the red carpet. Everyone was like who are you wearing? Who are you wearing? And that was the moment that it was okay yeah I have something here. This was something I did in a couple of days and hadn’t put that much thought into, so I knew if I gave it a real chance it could be something special.”
The dress made news at the Latin Grammys and caught the eye of a fellow stylist. 
“I took the dress that I had and I had it in my showroom and a stylist Ricky he pulled the dress for his client and she made the cover for people in Espanol which meant so much to me as a Latina and I was just blown away that my very first garment and the very first creation I made was on the cover of people, so it was very humbling,” Mercedes said. 
Mercedes is passionate not only about fashion but about making fashion more inclusive for curvy women. 
“I think it’s just wrong to leave people out and exclude people and for curvy women plus-size women, it’s more than half of women that are plus so it doesn’t make sense to exclude them and cut them out. That’s what I would say just not leaving anyone out and if you want to be inclusive you should be in any capacity that you can,” Mercedes said. 
When thinking about her career’s unique path, the designer doesn’t regret her degree in school counseling. 
“Counseling is honestly the icing on the cake, you know people say ‘oh you went in a completely different direction’ but I really think that counseling is such a really big part of fashion and working with people and body images,” she said.  “Especially me because I work with women who are curvier than the rest and so  that takes sometimes some patience and understanding that knowing how to deal with different personalities has been very helpful.”
The designer is honored to be nominated for the Cultivate award and hopes to win. “The Cultivate Award is an award that is being given by the Curvy Fashionista and it is sponsored by ELOQUII, they wanted to create a contest for designers of color to highlight women and people of color to showcase creativity,” Mercedes said. “Everyone can tune in to the Cultivate Award on May second.”

“The Shiver”  is a new alternative indie radio show hosted by sophomore art education major Jane Montalto and sophomore English education major Tori Monteleone. 
The co-hosts share a love for alternative music and love the chance to share it with listeners. 
“We call it like a show and tell of alternative music so I pick four songs, Tori picks four songs most of the time neither of us has heard the songs the other person picks so we talk about the songs,” Montalto said. “I’m obsessed with music so it’s kind of a cool way to talk about music uninterrupted.”
Monteleone came up with the name for the show when thinking about the university mascot.
“I thought of the shiver because shiver is the name of a group of sharks so like we’re the LIU sharks shiver and our music is so cool it’ll make you shiver,” Monteleone said. 
Montalto has a broad music taste. 
“I think it’s very all over the place, which is I say alternative. I like more indie rock, sometimes singer-songwriter folkie music but then I also like new wave stuff like I’m wearing my talking heads shirt today, so I like that kind of music too,” Montalto said.  
The pair includes a “Shiver Shout Out” to help viewers find new music during the show.
“Every week we also do the shiver shoutout so like I’ve been trying to find smaller artists and stuff like that to tell people about that’s a cool way to find new music and I joke that it’s music that like a person is gonna blow up and you can gatekeep your friends, like ‘oh I heard them when they only had 800 listeners on Spotify so,” Montalto said. 
The co-hosts recorded their first episode recently and recounted the experience. 
“It was nerve-wracking I’ll say that especially because you have to record a demo first and then the radio station listens to it then you go, so when we were recording our demo they only had one headphone jack so only Jane had headphones so I was just reacting because I couldn’t hear everything at once so it was more of trying to anticipate what was going on but I really think we hit our stride,” Monteleone said. 
Montalto shared Monteleone’s nerves, but quickly got the hang of things. 
“For me the first show, I do the board of stuff and the levels of audio, so it was definitely scary because like when you do the demo it was okay if I mess this up it’s fine we can just start over and we can do it again but when it’s a live show you’re you just have to keep going. It’s still a learning curve for me because even last week’s episode I accidentally forgot to pause the music and turned back the computer audio and you could hear the next start for a second while Tori was talking and her face was like ‘uh’ no ‘go go go go go’ we have ten seconds. Definitely ‘the show must go on’ type of thing,” Montalto said. 
Viewers can listen to “The Shiver” every Thursday from 6 to 7 p.m. at LIUWave.org, and keep up with the show on Instagram and Twitter at @TheShiver.

The department of music recently ranked number nine on a list of Best Music Colleges in New York in 2021 for Best Value Schools. 
“Post offers a conservatory-style program that brings a diverse array of performance and academic opportunities,” the website said. “Undergraduate students can pursue a bachelor of music in music education, a bachelor of science in music, or a bachelor of fine arts in music technology, entrepreneurship, and production. The department provides a variety of public performance opportunities to showcase students’ skills and talents, including solo student recitals, workshops, masterclasses, and concerts both on campus and at major concert halls in New York City and abroad.”
Music students at the university are proud to be a part of the accomplishment.
“When I first heard that LIU’s music program was recognized as one of the best in New York, I was excited, but not surprised,” senior instrumental performance major Jaclyn Smith said. “Over the years, the department of music has fostered an environment where I could grow as a musician.”
Smith is the principal clarinetist of the orchestra, wind ensemble and wind symphony. She has also been a part of some chamber music ensembles during her time at Post.
Senior instrumental performance major Sarah Kadtke, who plays both the flute and piccolo and partakes in the wind ensemble, wind symphony, orchestra, percussion ensemble, and chamber music ensembles, agrees with Smith.
“For my past four years here, the Department’s faculty have consistently gone above and beyond to provide for its students, despite obstacles put in their way,” she said. “The care they obviously hold for us is matched only by their dedication to music and seeing us students on the path to success. I hope that this recognition serves to have that attitude rewarded.”
Despite challenges with practicing and performing music during the pandemic, music students at Post enjoyed their time in their ensembles.
“Having to transition to fully remote learning at the start of the pandemic effectively turned mine [and the rest of the department’s] way of musical life upside down,” Kadtke said. “A large amount of how we function had to stop entirely. On top of that, continuing miscommunication regarding the use and future of our facilities has placed a tremendous strain on the department’s students and faculty.” 
Smith believes that finding free time as a music student can be difficult, and advises students to learn time management skills early on.
“Our academic classes are in the morning, while our ensembles rehearse in the evening, and in between, we have to practice. This leaves many of us with very little time for breaks,” she said.
Although the schedule of music students can be hectic, Kadtke and Smith have made some of their best memories in the Department of Music.
“From my four years in LIU’s music program, my best memory would have to be from the summer of 2018,” Smith said. “For about two weeks, I toured Australia with the Long Island Symphonic Winds, where we performed at multiple venues, including the world-renowned Sydney Opera House.”
Smith also recalls one of her favorite performances during the fall 2019 wind symphony concert.
“One of the pieces we played was Frank Ticheli’s Blue Shades, where I stood up in the middle of the performance to play a one-minute-long solo from memory,” smith said. “Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, that concert was the last time I performed on stage at the Tilles Center.”
Kadtke doesn’t have a favorite performance, but remembers all of her performances at the university fondly.
“I truly cherish every opportunity I receive to perform,” she said. “It does feel especially fulfilling to be able to perform alongside my closest friends in the Department in my ensembles, especially in the form of duets and trios.”
Music students accredit a lot of the department of music’s success to the faculty members and professors.
“I’ve been fortunate enough to receive endless support from my main studio professor, Dr. Susan Deaver,” Kadtke said. “Her influence and teaching made an extremely positive impact in my musicianship – I can confidently say that I would not be the musician I am today without her encouragement over four years.” 
Smith is grateful for Department Chair Dr. James McRoy, who she has been an administrative assistant for this year.
“Not only did we spend lots of time learning conducting techniques, but more importantly, we taught each other plenty of life lessons, and kept each other sane during these busy semesters,” she said.
After graduating this semester, Smith plans on teaching private lessons to aspiring musicians, and Kadtke will be pursuing her Master’s Performance degree at the Aaron Copland School of Music. 
“To me, music is the ultimate form of collaboration between people; it’s so important to recognize that it’s nearly impossible to be a musician in an isolated vacuum,” Kadtke said. “You’ll need to work hard – harder than you can imagine – but it’s essential to recognize and invest in the relationships you have with other musicians. Those relationships, like music, can’t be so easily dismissed by disaster.”
Both Smith and Kadtke will be premiering their senior recitals virtually in the upcoming weeks, interested students can email them at jaclyn.smith2@my.liu.edu and sarah.katdke@my.liu.edu respectively to request details for streaming.

As vaccines are being administered across the country, nursing students are doing their part in helping with the fight against Covid 19.  Student volunteers have begun administering the Moderna vaccine at the campus’s vaccine center located at the University Center. 
The vaccination center was originally announced by Nassau County Executive Laura Curran on Thursday, Feb. 11, for faculty and members of the local community who met New York state’s guidelines for being vaccinated. The vaccine center began giving doses of the vaccine to interested students on Friday, April 23, after eligibility was extended to anyone over the age of 16.
Students will need to be able to come back to campus for the second dose, or schedule a Moderna appointment in their hometown. School will not be in session by the time the students are due for their second shots.
The vaccine center is entirely student run, with everything from checking in to administering the vaccine being performed by students. Each room has one professor and at least two students to ensure everything is being done correctly. Medical professionals are also on standby in the case of an emergency. 
The opportunity to volunteer wasn’t only open to nursing students, as students from different departments volunteered to help in different ways. Non-nursing students are helping take temperatures, check people in and guide patients to their proper room so that nobody needs to unnecessarily come in contact with each other.
Nursing students who volunteered to help administer the vaccine needed to complete a series of online training modules that taught them the proper technique for administering the vaccine, and practice giving the vaccine to a mannequin, according to Director of the Inter-professional Simulation Center Debra McWilliams. 
The modules helped prepare students for when it was time to administer the actual vaccine.
“It helped a lot, there were a lot of visuals and you come in here and you’re not just thrown in, you know exactly what you’re doing,” junior nursing major Shanna Lynn Maleitz said.
Students felt good about being able to do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19.
“It feels really good to be helping to end this war against the virus,” junior nursing major Ahmad Yasser said.
Maleitz was happy to volunteer because she believes that she is helping to create history.
Other students felt a need to help their community, which drove them to volunteer. 
“I feel like it’s our duty,” junior nursing major Andy Nunez said. “We’re in the field of nursing and this is what we’re going to be doing in the future anyway, so what better way to do it then in our community and in our school.”
Nunez also recognized the importance of the vaccines.
“There’s a lot of deaths going on because of this, so to think this could have saved somebody’s life is pretty meaningful,” he said.
On Friday, April 23, 500 doses of the Moderna vaccine were available to interested students. Monij Sankhe, a masters student in the health care administration program, received a dose of the vaccine and was happy with the results.
“It was very easy, it was very streamlined, I was welcomed very nicely and the whole process was like a piece of cake for me,” he said. “Even when I got vaccinated I didn’t even feel it.”
The accessibility of the vaccine was exciting to many students. 
“I had to call the vaccine hotline every single day trying to get an appointment and I couldn’t get one anyone around here, so the current one I have scheduled is five and a half hours away on May 3rd,” sophomore musical theatre major Nick Larsen said.
Larsen quickly scheduled an appointment on campus shortly after receiving the email. The campus vaccination will save him an entire day, and over ten hours of driving.
Other students are weighing how they will make the second dose work for them, because they live out of state.
”It’s not that far of a drive back, if I have to come back I will, but I am going to try to schedule my second dose at home in Massachusetts,” junior musical theatre Renee Hamilton said.
Hamilton wishes the campus had opened up for vaccinations earlier, but is grateful to have the opportunity at all. Being a theatre major, she has been forced to shift many aspects of her creative life.
“Covid has taken so much of my life away from me. It has taken live theatre from me, I saw my grandma very intermittently,” Hamilton said.
Hamilton is excited that she will be able to see her 83 year old grandmother more often once she has the vaccine in her system. 
For Hamilton, scheduling an appointment was extremely easy and took her less than five minutes. She encourages everyone who can to find a vaccine appointment as soon as possible.
Dean of the School of Health Professionals and Nursing, Dr. Denise Walsh, believes that the experience of operating a vaccine center right next to campus has been a positive experience for everyone involved. 
“It has been a wonderful experience for not only the students but the community, to see that LIU is a part of this community and we want to give back to the people that we live with and work with,” she said. “Everyone who came through here had such a positive experience. The students who worked here had a positive experience because we emphasize that we are a part of a global community and we’re reaching out to the members of the world to help them, as in healthcare, because we are healthcare professionals that’s what our profession is based on, reaching out to others.”
Students who are interested in scheduling an appointment for a vaccine in Nassau County can visit https://vaccine.nassaucountyny.gov/ for more information.
