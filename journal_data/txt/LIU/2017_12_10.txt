The women’s basketball team faced the University of Bridgeport in the first game of the East Coast Conference (ECC) on Wednesday, Dec. 6. After a long off season tour, they returned to their home court to clinch a 68-61 victory.
The Pioneers are coming from 4-4 in the last eight games of the off-season. “The biggest change we need to work on is our start, we always start games slow,” Mikaiya Moore, sophomore forward, said before the Dec. 6 game. “We need start upbeat, have high energy and that will keep the pace of the game. Start well, finish well.”
The Pioneers started strong, jumping to a 9-2 lead five minutes into the contest. Bridgeport answered back with a 12-6 run to cut its deficit to one (15-14), but the Pioneers secured a 30-26 lead into the break.
Halfway through the third frame, the Pioneers took a ten point lead over Bridgeport (42-32), but the Bridgeport came back with a 10-2 tally to pull within two (44-42).
Towards the end of the second half, Bridgeport once again pulled within a basket of the Pioneers (63-61), with 1:08 to play. In the final minute of the game, the Pioneers pulled ahead to score the 68-61 victory.
Moore tallied a team-best 17 points and went 7-for-10 from the charity stripe. Shannon Doyle, junior and guard, went for 14 points and two rebounds, and Dominique Williams, sophomore guard, scored nine points.
The Pioneers will continue on to game two of the conference on Saturday, Dec. 9 when they take on Mercy College away at 12 p.m.

The men’s basketball team hosted the University of Bridgeport in the opener for the 2017-2018 East Coast Conference on Wednesday, Dec. 6, at the Pratt Recreation Center. The Pioneers suffered a loss of 97-70, leaving them to fall 2-6 on the year (2-5 for the season, 0-1 for ECC) while the Purple Knights improved to 7-1.
Through seven non-conference games, the Pioneers were heading into a rough start with a record of 2-5. “[We need to] buy into the program that Coach Smiles has enlisted with us,” Alonzo Ortiz-Traylor, freshman guard and forward, said before the Dec. 6 game. “The coaches know what they are talking about, so if we buy back into our program, we’ll be perfect.”
The Pioneers seemed to stray from this program during the game, as Bridgeport grabbed an early lead in the first half, with a score of 47-24 before the break.
Aary Bibens, returning senior and guard, netted the first basket of the second half to cut the lead to 21 (47-26). The Pioneers were unable to snatch the lead throughout the last period before the Purple Knights clinched the 97-70 victory.
The Pioneers will play their second ECC  game  on Saturday, Dec. 9 at Mercy College at 3 p.m.

Students who stay on Long Island over the winter break are always looking for new and fun activities. This winter, they should look no further than their own backyard. 
For those who do not want to be in the snow, the Westbury Market Fair is a great indoor place to explore. This marketplace has over 100 vendors, so you are sure to find something you will like. “Everybody owns their own business, [there are] a lot of small business owners, which is great for the economy and community,” Brian Lunch, a small business owner, said.
