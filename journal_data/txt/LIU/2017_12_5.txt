The Department of Health and Physical Education held its second annual bike race fundraiser on Wednesday, Nov. 29 in the Pratt Recreation Center. Students and faculty alike paid an entrance fee of $6.25 plus any additional donations, and gathered in teams of four in the Pratt multipurpose room to raise awareness of down’s syndrome, autism, and other developmental diseases.
Proceeds of the event were donated to the Association for Children with Down’s Syndrome (ACDS), a special education school in Plainview dedicated to servicing both children and adults with autism and other developmental diseases. The proceeds will help to enrich the student’s educational career, all in an effort to make everyday a new and exciting learning experience.
A Post alumnus works at ACDS. “[We] chose ACDS because my good friend, Joe Ansalone works as a physical education teacher there, and [after] realizing his situation with a lack of resources to use with his students, thought it would be a good opportunity to not only raise awareness for Down syndrome, autism, and other disabilities, but also to give the students there new equipment to use in class that they previously did not have,” Nick Brown, a junior health and physical education major, and one of the student who co-planners for the event, said. “[He] hopes this money will bring joy to not only the students in class, but to their parents as well, knowing their children can explore and learn in even more ways with this new equipment.”
“It seemed like a good idea to contribute whatever we can, so all of the funds raised by this event are being donated with the intent of increasing the quality of equipment and education for every single student there,” Gail Weintraub, professor of health, physical education and movement science, and faculty adviser of the event, said.
The event kicked off with a brief introduction of the rules, safety precautions, and an overview of ACDS and its role in enriching the lives of students everyday. Soon enough the music was blasted and pedaling began. The rules were simple: pedal until you’re tired, then switch out with someone else on your team. At the end of the 45 minute period, the team who pedaled the farthest received a $25 gift card, for each of the four members, to the Cheesecake Factory. The event also included a full dinner buffet for students to refuel their energy.
“I [liked] the atmosphere, it was competitive but fun. There wasn’t a lot of tension even though we were all competing and everyone wanted to win. We were having fun more than anything,” Nick Conetta, a freshman health and physical education major, and one of the participants, said. “It felt good to be participating in something super fun and something that was benefiting others. I’d definitely do it again, and hopefully win next time,” he continued.
Over $250 was raised for ACDS. The bike race donation funds bring the students of ACDS just one step closer to being offered the resources they need to be successful.

During the first two weeks of the fall 2017 semester, four consecutive cases of sexual assault were reported by students, according to the crime log maintained by the Public Safety department, as required by federal law. Immediately following the allegations, on Sept. 15, the offices of Campus Life, Public Safety and the athletics department held a joint Title IX training day to educate students and staff on state and federal law, bystander training, and the university’s policies.
This 21⁄2 hour training was attended by 631 participants and included two university speakers, Michael Berthel, dean of students, and Jean Anne Smith, assistant dean of students and Deputy Title IX Coordinator, and Kim Bryson, a representative from the New York State Police Department. Video training materials were also provided for attendees.
Members of athletic teams, student clubs, fraternities and sororities were required to attend the training. It focused on issues associated with sexual respect and sexual harassment and violence, but it was not focused on any particular incident or incidents, according to Berthel.
Several athletes have contributed to the discussion of sexual assault that they have witnessed within their own teams and in the larger athletic department. A member of the rugby team who did not want to be named, confirmed that “it’s being talked about by lots of people on campus.” The Pioneer learned about both the reports of sexual assault and the meeting from multiple students, who asked that their names not be used.
“For privacy reasons that are mandated by law, we cannot comment on any specific case or allegation, and of course we cannot comment on rumors,” Berthel said. Under the Clery Act, a federal law that aims to ensure transparency around campus crime reporting, the university is required to make publicly available information about every crime reported to public safety, listing the date (occurred and reported), nature, time, general location, and the disposition of the complaint, if known. The law requires both public and private colleges to maintain daily crime logs, but it does not require publication of confidential information, such as names and specific locations.
The University consults with law enforcement professionals when appropriate to determine the best course of action to ensure campus safety and security, according to Berthel. “I cannot comment on particular incidents, but the University evaluates every incident to determine whether a timely warning to the campus is necessary,” Berthel said in an email. “If we determine that such a warning under the Clery Act is necessary, we would notify the entire campus.”
Yet, students have expressed frustration about the lack of information that was provided about the alleged sexual assaults at the beginning of this semester. “I feel like there is no specific protocol in place if, God forbid, you’re sexually assaulted,” Tianna D’Italia, a junior business major and PR chair for Delta Zeta sorority, said. D’Italia believes that students should at least be notified when things of this nature happen on campus. “Shed a light on what’s going on. It shouldn’t take 50 unknown things to happen before things change,” she said. “Don’t make it such an uncomfortable thing to talk about, because it’s so important and affects every single student.”
Berthel defended the university’s reporting protocols. “Long Island University is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment free from all forms of sexual misconduct, and LIU takes its responsibility to protect our students with the utmost seriousness,” he said. As a member of the New York Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, Long Island University supported New York State’s “Enough is Enough” law, that Governor Cuomo signed into law in 2015, and which contains the nation’s most aggressive law addressing sexual assault on campuses, Berthel said in an email. The university policies and procedures on sexual assault must comply with both that state law and the federal Title IX law.
One in three women experience some kind of abuse in college, according to the Safe Center of Long Island, a nonprofit agency serving victims of abuse. “If it happens to you, don’t stay quiet. It’s best to get help,” Stephanie Jean, a representative of the Safe Center, said. “If you do want to reach out, come forward and reach out. The Safe Center has a 24-hour hotline, seven days a week, and it’s free.”
The university provides additional resources and support for victims of sexual violence and harassment, including counseling and advocacy. Jean Anne Smith, the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, serves as a liaison for all students involved, educating them on relevant policies, procedures, and the process. Staff from the Center for Healthy Living provides free counseling as a service to Post students. Both are available to provide confidential support.
Smith has been the Deputy Title IX Coordinator for the Post campus since her hire as Associate Dean of Students in 2014. “I have an open door policy. All students, staff and faculty can come to my office at any time to discuss concerns,” Smith said. Smith assists in setting up training sessions, verifying policy and procedures and discusses support services on and off campus. “I feel that the most important part of my job is being a resource for all community members,” she said.
“LIU is committed to ensuring that all our students receive appropriate training and are educated about these important issues,” Berthel said. While the September 15 training was focused on student leaders, athletes and clubs members, it was only one of over a dozen trainings and programs that are hosted annually. All students are trained on sexual respect and Title IX during the required new student orientation. Annual educational programs hosted in conjunction with Campus and Greek Life include events such as Take Back the Night, “The Hunting Ground” screening, and Clothesline for Courage, which took place during the 2016-2017 school year and were covered by The Pioneer.
All complaints are handled in accordance with the procedures set forth in the university’s Sexual Violence and Harassment Policy, which can be found in the student handbook at liu.edu/post/studenthandbook or on the university website at liu.edu/About-LIU/University-Policies/ Sexual-Respect.
The policy requires an investigation of allegations of sexual violence and harassment. Trained investigators in Campus Life conduct those investigations, according to Berthel. All hearing officers are regularly trained on the university policy and how to properly investigate any alleged violation of the code of conduct. In addition, campus life staff members participate in outside trainings that are developed for these specific  investigations, according to Berthel.
At the end any investigation, there is a determination based upon a “preponderance of the evidence” standard, of whether a violation occurred and, if so, what the appropriate sanction is. The sanction will depend upon the particular facts and the seriousness of the violation, and could include reprimand, counseling, suspension, or expulsion, Berthel said. Students also have the ability to appeal, in writing, the outcome of the investigation to the university.
Multiple student athletes, who spoke to the Pioneer anonymously for fear of reprimand, have confirmed that at least one of the students responsible for the alleged sexual assault cases in the beginning of the fall semester has been suspended, yet for how long is unknown. Berthel would not comment on specific cases due to confidentiality concerns.
The Pioneer contacted two out of the four victims of these alleged incidents, but they chose to keep their stories off the record, to prevent further injury. The safety of the complaining parties and of students on campus are of paramount importance, according to Berthel. “While we cannot comment on specific cases, the university takes appropriate measures to ensure safety and security on campus,” he said.
The university can take a number of steps to address possible safety concerns while a case is investigated and possibly adjudicated if the level of the crime goes beyond university disciplinary standards. These could include a no-contact order between students, suspension from the residence halls, or suspension from campus pending the outcome of the investigation, according to the university policy.

During winter break, students are able to take extra credits to expedite the process of graduation. But this winter, there aren’t many students signing up for classes. This year, there is a decline in the amount of students that registered for winter courses compared to last year.
The winter session, which runs from Jan. 2 to Jan. 15, offers students the chance to select from over 30 undergraduate courses. Students earn three credits in just ten days, whether to get ahead in their requirements and or to get on track to graduating early. Classes are available in the morning, afternoon, or evening and run Monday through Friday.
Willie Hiatt, associate professor of Latin American history, teaches “The West & World Since 1750” during winter break. “As of right now, only three students have signed up for my class. In the winter of 2016, six students took the same course. Three years ago, I had 17 students,” he said. “My suspicion is that low winter enrollments reflect our overall enrollment decline since 2013,” he continued. In the last five years, there have been freshmen classes of approximately 550 students to the current 701 students; before that time, the university often had classes of more than 800 students, according to Hiatt. “Put simply, we don’t have many students anymore,” he said.
While the enrollment of the incoming freshmen classes seem to be falling, some students opt not to take winter courses. “I wouldn’t take any winter or summer classes because you have to pay for the classes and the housing,” Kelvin Campbell, a senior criminal justice major, said. “The classes are too expensive and it’s a lot harder to cram information in such a short amount of time,” Darwan Simon, a junior health science major and business minor, said.
To take a course during the winter semester, it will cost $875 per credit for undergraduate studies and $1,201 per credit for graduate studies, including a $100 University fee. On top of the cost of credits, if students wanted to stay on campus during the break, they would have to pay extra dorming fees.
The university website offers course descriptions following the Undergraduate Bulletin and the Graduate Bulletin. Both current LIU Post students, new students, and visiting students from other colleges and universities are welcome to enroll into a winter session. Students can choose from undergraduate core courses such as English, history, philosophy, and psychology, or major required courses in economics, art, digital art & design, terrorism and criminal justice. Graduate students are able to select form courses “Special Problems Lab Medicine,” “Critical Issues in Law & Society,” “Terrorism (Trump Presidency & Terrorism),” “Public Policy & Public Choice,” “Special Problems in Political Science” and an independent study.
Information on how to enroll into a winter session or to view the courses, students can go to www.liu.edu/CWPost/Admission/Winter- Sessions/Register.

Students entering Winnick Dining hall the morning of Nov. 29, noticed a drastic change in the cleanliness of the floors, tables and equipment as well as the presentation of the food.

An article in the Pioneer entitled “Cleanliness of Winnick Dining Hall was published online on Nov. 28 and in print on Nov. 29. After the Pioneer investigated student complaints about Winnick, according to Michael Berthel, dean of students, “a meeting was convened with Aramark and A&A management teams to discuss the current state of Winnick and identify the immediate needs.”
Directly following the meeting, a plan was put in place to “address all concerns, clean all facilities and equipment, and re-design the stations to provide an enhanced presentation to all food stations. Following the cleaning, Aramark purchased new equipment and items that will help to enhance the look of the dining hall. “Some of these additions have already been implemented with additional [equipment] being added in the next few days,” Berthel stated.
Students have noticed the change in the dining hall, and seem pleased with the changes. “It’s never been like this,” Emilia Herran, a senior business marketing major, said. Zachary Cofrancesco, a junior business finance major said he has seen a huge improvement in the visual appeal of the dining hall.
“Curly fries every day. Bring nuggets back to Winnick,” Greg Lee, a junior sociology major, said about the change of menu options made on Thursday, Nov. 30, when curly fries and chicken nuggets were offered at the Street Food station.
According to Berthel, other changes will be made at Winnick in the coming weeks. A&A, the outside custodial company that oversees cleaning the dining facility, has increased evening custodial staff to help prepare the facility for the following day. Both Aramark and A&A are reviewing all campus locations to ensure facilities are being properly maintained.
“My job is to be the chief advocate for students on campus and I want to hear about their experience. This has been a very collaborative process to address student concerns and ensure that we are offering an outstanding dining experience for our students. We will continue to identify ways to improve food service, facilities, and student life,” Berthel said.
Students can send questions or concerns regarding the dining hall to Berthel at Michael.Berthel@liu.edu.

The past few weeks have been full of pumpkins, apples, and colorful leaves. December has arrived, and students are getting into the holiday cheer. Whether it is shopping at the mall or attending a Christmas party, Christmas music is a way to keep people together and put you in the holiday spirit. You can find Christmas music on local stations such as 106.7 Lite FM, the iHeart Radio app and on streaming devices such as Apple and Amazon music. Some students at Post love old and new Christmas music that they just can’t get enough. Whether new or old, Christmas music has remained alive and will live on for Christmas’ to come.                The Pioneer interviewed some students asking them what their favorite holiday songs are:

For many people, Santa Claus was and still is a very important part of their childhood. When Christmas time comes along, some parents would convince their children that Santa Claus would come down the chimney and leave gifts for the good and coal for the naughty. Some other parents didn’t like lying to their children and would tell them he wasn’t real.
Some students actually figured it out themselves using context clues! Here’s how some students found out that Santa, was actually their parents.
“I was 7 and I realized I didn’t have a chimney so how else was someone bringing presents to me with my doors locked,” said Gabriella Bruno, a senior social work major. “Also Santa and my mom had the same wrapping paper,” she added. No chimney, no Santa.
Another student didn’t find out the news as lightly as Bruno. Madeline Nunley, a senior Digital arts and design major, had her world flipped upside-down. “I was six years old when I first found out Santa didn’t exist. I went grocery shopping with my mom, aunt and cousin who was 13 at the time right before Christmas. And as we were walking to the car he blurted out that Santa wasn’t real and my world shattered in those few seconds. My mom tried to reassure me that he was only kidding but from that moment on I was very skeptical and didn’t trust it. I finally knew for a fact that Santa wasn’t real when I realized my moms handwriting and Santa’s handwriting was the exact same. At that point I already kind of knew so it wasn’t ground breaking but it definitely still was sad!”
Whether it was not having a chimney, noticing the wrapping paper or handwriting, or having someone crush your dreamworld, there’s many other ways to find out that Santa Claus wasn’t the one leaving you gifts or drinking your milk and eating your cookies.

The saying goes that the holiday season is the “most wonderful time of the year”, right? Food, family, Christmas, vacations… It’s more than easy to point out all the wonderful things about the time between Thanksgiving to Christmas, but what we often overlook, whether it be because we’re still young and have yet to taken over some of the authority that’s required to make the holiday season special, or because we simply don’t think about it, is the stress that comes along with the magic.
According to a study done by the American Psychological Association in 2006, on average, 61% of Americans experience an increase in stress levels during the holiday season. Like so many things in this world, beneath all of the glitz and glamour lie struggles.
As pointed out in a 2013 study done by the Cognitive Neuroscience Society, holiday demands put a great deal of pressure on a section of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. This section is responsible for planning, memory, attention, organization, and allocating appropriate behavior across multiple environments. Because of all the must do’s during the “happiest season of all”, the prefrontal cortex gets overused and burnt out. This leads to a decrease in memory proficiency, decreased ability to multitask, and a slower production of new, healthy cells. Couple this with a diet of sugar cookies and eggnog and no exercise, and you’ve got yourself a merry mess.
While all of this is true of the holiday season, in no way does this mean that the holidays can’t be enjoyed. Nick Conetta, a freshman said that he’s “super excited for the upcoming break and the holidays. He can’t wait to catch up with his family on their annual Catskills vacation, eat tons of food and take a much needed break from work and wrestling. Regarding finals, “Time management and staying on top of everything is key to not letting the stress of the season build up,” he added.
Some words of advice I’d give to anyone who wants to avoid their annual holiday spike in blood pressure is to set realistic goals. Plan to purchase gifts that are within a fair price range and don’t spread yourself too thin trying to accomplish ten things in one day.
Also, it’s important to surround yourself with loved ones who understand the stress in your life and are willing to help when they can.

Hillwood is usually buzzing throughout the day, especially during common hour, but recently it has gotten even more exciting.
The Campus Life staff and student workers spent a day decorating Hillwood Commons for the holidays. The lights, holiday decorations, activities, and Christmas tree add some spirit for Post students in a popular social spot on campus as they are getting swamped with the end of the semester school work.
Holidays at Hillwood, a popular holiday event, will be held this year on Thursday, Dec. 7. The night will be kicked off with the annual lighting of the mansion, with activities in Hillwood to follow.
Some of this year’s activities will include fan favorites, such as an ice skating rink (inside Hillwood), Build- A- Bear stuffing, and personalized holiday cards, Matthew Blanar, assistant director of campus life, said. Donations will also be collected for Toys for Tots, to give to children in need for the holiday season.
“Holidays at Hillwood is always my favorite event, I look forward to the joy that the holidays bring and watching everyone try and ice skate in the fishbowl!” Blanar said.
This event held the past few years is popular for students, and is a good way to get involved. “I look forward to this event every year. It’s not often that there are events like this on campus. It’s the one event that I stay on campus for,” Danielle Edwards, a junior digital game design major and commuter, said. It is a good opportunity to meet new people and for those away from home, celebrate the holidays with friends.
The mansion lighting will be held at 4:45 pm, and the Holidays in Hillwood will begin at 5 pm on Dec. 7.

There are millions of reason to be happy during the holidays such as seeing family, friends, eating good food and giving and getting presents. For some it might not be a simple as that. There can be family issues that prevent you from being joyful through the season or for others they aren’t able to get home to be with family during this time. 
On campus, there are many international students who have sacrificed leaving their loved ones to attend school here. Harry Pearse is an international student from England and is a senior philosophy major. His main reason for coming to school here was because of the soccer team, the coach and the scholarship he was offered.
“At first it was tough to leave my parents, and the comforts of home, but after the first or second semester I got used to it and it actually became quite normative to only see them for a couple of weeks and leave” Pearse said. Pearse is able to make the best out of his holidays because of the amazing friends that he has here. He describes his teammates as a second family to him. They make it festive and homely even though he can’t be with his family.
A piece of advice that Pearse can give to other international students who aren’t able to go home during the holidays is to not sit at home by yourself. Pearse said, “Go out with your friends and go explore what New York has to offer. It celebrates the holidays like no other country! Take advantage of the situation you are in, because there are so many children who don’t even have a home to keep warm, or fill their noses with cinnamon”.
This is advice to anyone feeling alone during this holiday season. Look for the little things to be thankful for and enjoy it. There is always a positive way to look at any situation you are put into so make the best of it. Keeping yourself busy is a great way to stay happy. Bake cookies, watch holiday movies and spend time with those around you.

Although it is the “most wonderful time of the year,” it can also be one of the most stressful times of the year for college students.
Finishing the semester strong, turning in last minute work, and studying for finals that determine your overall grade is already enough to churn anxiety. Then comes the holidays. Students arrive home for winter break with few days before Christmas, and realize that they have to get gifts for their friends and family with limited time and money.
The best strategy is to look for online deals, to avoid going out to stores, and allow yourself to quickly take a break from studying. “Cyber Monday is a college student’s best friend during the holidays,” Sarah Anthony, a sophomore psychology major, said.
Cyber Monday solves a lot of issues, including limiting expenses, doing your shopping all online, and getting it done quickly and efficiently. The gifts can be mailed right to the student’s mailbox at Post. It also allows the shopping to be completed early, making the rest of the semester less stressful.
It is important to prioritize. Set time aside to get everything done. Whether you are studying, packing to go home, or buying presents, doing one thing at a time will ensure confidence in whatever you are doing. Making to-do lists as well as allocating time to get everything done may help as well.
Other students find end of semester holiday shopping to be a good release from studying. “Christmas shopping at the end of the semester is a form of procrastination”, Amanda Flynn, a junior radiologic technology major, said. It may take time away from studying but it is also a good way to get your mind off all of the school work that has to get done.
The campus bookstore is a convenient place to get gifts for family and friends. Many students’ family and friends like to support the school by wearing Post apparel, and it is right on campus with accessible hours. Utilizing the campus and other resources such as the student-run businesses, such as Browse, Pioneer Nation, and The Student Body boutique helps to get the Christmas shopping done quickly in between studying. The campus shuttle bus also runs to the Broadway Mall in Hicksville every day at various hours for student convenience.

Caroline Bert, a senior photography major, launched a photography club on campus this semester. Bert has been working with coordinators from the office of campus life to form the club. The process included getting students to join and forming an editorial board, as well as various paperwork to make the club official. The club has held two meetings.
The club is open to students of all years and majors, not just photography majors, and meets every other Wednesday during common hour in Pell Hall room 101. The club currently has 13 members comprised of mostly photography majors and a faculty advisor, Allison Rufrano, an adjunct professor of photography in the department of art.
Bert’s mission for the club is to “expand the community past the department, and provide new and different opportunities to students.” The club will be taking photos of each other, sharing ideas, working with different types of camera equipment and will have the chance to explore photography creatively outside the classroom setting. Students who do not have photography experience will have the opportunity to learn from others in the club.
Students interested in joining or obtaining more information about the photography club can email pellhallphoto@gmail.com. The club’s latest work can be seen on Instagram @LIUpostphoto.

Many students are unaware that the Steinberg Art Museum has moved from its previous location on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, where the bookstore is now located, to the lower level of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library.
After being closed since July 2017 for renovation, the museum reopened to the public on Monday, Nov. 13. Many passers by have stopped in to check out the newly opened space. “Every single person that walked in today really seemed to enjoy it and was happy that it was here,” Nicholas Frank, freshman graphic design major who works in the museum, said. There have been approximately 20-30 visitors each day since the opening. The museum has been open for just a few hours each day, with no solidified opening and closing hours. These will be determined after winter break ends.
Students may apply for work study positions in the museum, applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Frank has taken advantage of the opportunity. “When I first told people that I got a job at the museum, the most common response I got was: ‘We have a museum?’” he said. The Steinberg Museum has been significantly renovated in its new location. One new feature is luminescent marble flooring. “It’s definitely improved; there’s much better lighting and it’s a lot more quiet and museum-like,” he said, “The amount of space that we have now is better.”
Constructing a new museum requires ensuring heating, cooling, air conditioning, lighting, and locks are all in working order, according to Barbara Applegate, director of the Steinberg Museum of Art. “Many museums’ re-openings are planned to occur on a five-year timeline. Ours occurred on an 18-month time- line,” Applegate said, “So what we’re doing is thought of as a ‘soft opening.’” The museum will be fully opened when students and faculty return from winter break. At that time, museum sta ffmembers plan to hold an opening reception and panel discussions dealing with the current exhibition.
Once construction on the new museum location was finished, the 11 museum staff members began to uncrate artwork, previously stored at the Pollock-Krasner house, to begin the “unique” installation process. They first inspected the pieces and compared them to photographs received before the works’ arrival to ensure nothing had been damaged over the course of transport. After that came deciding on the placement of the paintings and didactics, banners to provide further information on the featured art. “Hanging an exhibition isn’t always formulaic, so there’s some play in here with that,” Applegate said, “We chose to top-align the majority of the works to keep everything smoothly running through the space.”
The Pollock-Krasner House recently gave museum staff approval to move the full collection of 5,000 pieces into a visible storage suite located near the Steinberg Museum on a retrofitted level of the library. This floor is built on a different level arrangement like the book stacks. “[This gives] us the opportunity to see those objects in a controlled and safe environment with access to all those objects,” Applegate said. Some of the artwork is over 5,000 years old from various time periods and countries. The space will allow students to use the artwork to conduct research the way they would books. “Say that you’re designing a costume for “The Lion King” and you want to see what African textiles look like. You can come here and find that out,” Applegate said, “This sets us far above anyone else in our region.” This suite will be accessible to the public.
The first exhibition in the new space, Abstract Expressionism Behind the Iron Curtain, will be displayed until April 7, 2018. “What I love about this [exhibition] in particular is how in the era of the Soviet Union and Soviet realism, these artist risked their lives doing this,” Frank said. A particular oil painting collage
by Tadeusz Kantor is partially comprised of a trash bag. Artwork featured in the museum are original pieces that have been transferred from the Pollock-Krasner House, a study center in Southampton N.Y. The pieces are loaned from different private and public collections in Munich, Czechoslovakia, Brooklyn and locations in Europe.
Programming for the next four years is underway, according to Applegate. As for announcing plans for future exhibitions now, “I’d be lifting the veil too soon,” she said. Museum staff has met with SAGE Long Island, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to meeting the needs of senior citizens of the LGBT community. According to Ari Nuzzo, museum educator, meetings like such help inspire programming for the rest of the year.
“Our goal is to meet with learners of any age group who want to be involved in our environment,” Nuzzo said, “We want to engage them in more things.”
An education outreach program associated with the Elmont school district will bring as many as 3000 elementary students to the museum over the spring semester. Nuzzo will coordinate this program, which will include tours for students and class groups. “We’ve had a lot of people interested in what’s going on,” Nuzzo said.
In April, MFA students will display an exhibition entitled “The Cutting Edge of Contemporary Art in a Variety of Media.” Applegate recently met with the students and Professor Seung Lee, director of graduate studies and the fine arts program, to discuss plans for installation. “A majority of them were what you might consider traditional media like painting, drawing and print making. One student works in three-dimensional ceramics,” Applegate said. The students are deciding and creating what pieces will be featured in their annual exhibition. Last year, the exhibition was held in the same place before renovations commenced.
Applegate hopes that students having access to the newly designed exhibition space on campus will give them space and time to closely observe the works. “We see every day thousands and thousands of memes and images, and we’re so quick to ash through them,” she said, “We’re constantly looking at images but in such a cursory way.”
Admission to the Steinberg Museum is free. “What I really like about having this museum on campus is that all the students here are able to see a wide variety of artists that they may never be able to see anytime otherwise,” Frank said.
For more information about the museum and inquiries regarding hours of operation, call the B. Davis Schwartz library at 516-299-4073.

During the winter 2017 season, the Tilles Center will host several holiday events from Christmas tales to Warner Brothers beloved classics. Beginning Dec. 15, “The Nutcracker” will kickoff the Christmas season. Shows including “Dirty Dancing” and “the Animaniacs” will fill out the rest of the season.
On Dec. 15 and 16, Eglevsky Ballet will perform “The Nutcracker” from 5-7 p.m. “It will be one of the most interesting shows for our students here at LIU,” Claire Kennedy, a secretary at the Tilles Center, said. For many, “The Nutcracker” is a childhood favorite that brings smiles along with the story of Clara and her journey through the Land of Sweets.
To kick off the new year, the touring Broadway cast of “Dirty Dancing” will perform on Jan. 5 at 8 p.m. and Jan. 6 at 2p.m. and 8p.m. This performance is filled with music, a heart-throbbing love story and eye-catching dancing.
“Dirty Dancing” the musical, based on the movie, will feature hit songs “Hungry Eyes,” “Hey Baby,” “Do You Love Me?,” and the iconic song from the 80s, “(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life.”
On Feb. 3 “Animaniacs LIVE!,” A musical starring original cast member Rob Paulsen will hit the Tilles stage at 7:30 p.m. The show will feature a live orchestra and a “live” performance of the “Animaniacs” cartoon characters holographically onstage. “This would be good for any kid that grew up in the 90s watching this show, it would be very nostalgic,” Dan Edwards, programming manager at the Tilles Center, said.
On Feb. 24, from 2-3 p.m., the storybook “Mr. Poppers Penguins” will come to life as a musical. The penguins will be portrayed by puppets. The audience can enjoy the story of Mr. Popper, Bill, Janie and their adventures with Captain Cook and the penguins. Everyone in the audience will get to act out a part of the story and take home a penguin craft. This is a family-friendly event; tots can anticipate a fun-filled afternoon.

While the Theater, Film and Dance building is relatively small, the amount of talent inside is large. Acting and musical theatre students are preparing for Post Theater Company’s (PTC) spring 2018 season while still finding time to study for finals. Even though the cast of “Spring Awakening” recently gave their last bow, theatre students are counting down the minutes towards auditions on Dec. 8 and Dec. 14-15.
Theatre majors have finals coming up like every other student; however, a large majority of them are graded on physical performances, such as scene showings, rather than performance on a multiple-choice exam. “You have to completely warp yourself into the person you are playing in order to succeed [when] auditioning for a role.” Gabby Amico, a senior dance major, said.
Josie Moyer, a freshman musical theater major, already had her dance final but has other finals coming up. While students generally don’t find most final exams fun, she said she had a blast; her final dances were for hip-hop and floor barre classes. “The floor barre dance was very interpretive, all about telling a story,” Moyer said. She described her monologue for auditions. “My character is struggling to show her employer all of the good she could do for the community as a performer,” she said. Even though this is Moyer’s first audition within PTC, she feels prepared, and she can’t wait for Dec. 15.
Paul Bakey, a junior musical theatre major, is not worried about his written finals; he’s more worried about his performance finals, but he is grateful that he can use his material for his performance final in auditions. For audition material, students were told to find two contrasting monologues. Last semester, Bakey used a short Shakespeare monologue which ultimately landed him a role in “Spring Awakening” where he was cast as Moritz.
“Auditioning is part of my major, so I consider the preparation for the auditions as preparing for finals,” Griffin Lockette, a junior musical theatre major said. When preparing for auditions, Lockette focuses greatly on her comedic monologue. “It flows off my tongue really smoothly,”she said. According to Lockette, the character she will portray has a serious personality but wants to showcase a more comedic side of herself.
“Acting and dance go hand-in-hand because you have to play different characters in both aspects. Just because dance isn’t a speaking role, it doesn’t mean that you aren’t acting,” Amico said.
While the PTC auditions and finals close in, students have taken advantage of what they’ve learned in class and are using their skills to study and to prepare for auditions. “The battle would have been completely internal,” Moyer said, “While I could see the different tactics of motivation present, I wouldn’t know how to make my performance all about affecting someone else.”
“Preparing for auditions is a little tough, but that is how preparing for this career is; balancing a lot of important things at once and having to do everything at 100%,” Amico, said.

The Chorus will perform with the Cecilia Chorus of New York at Carnegie Hall Dec. 9 under conductor Mark Shapiro. The concert will also feature Renee Tatum of the Metropolitan Opera. The chorus has performed in Ireland, Italy, and at various New York venues, including the Lincoln Center in Avery Fisher Hall, Alice Tully Hall, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.. They gave a preview performance of their Carnegie Hall repertoire on Nov. 29 in Hillwood Commons.
Mark Shapiro, conductor of the chorus, is no stranger to conducting at Carnegie Hall. “The LIU Post Chorus is a guest of the Cecilia Chorus of New York, one of New York’s oldest oratorio societies,” Shapiro said. An oratorio is a large work of music written for a vocal orchestra. “Their last conductor died in his nineties, and then they had a search for his replacement, and I was hired in 2011 by that chorus,” Shapiro said. When working with an oratorio group, he must conduct for both the instrumental ensemble and for vocalists. With the Cecilia Chorus, Shapiro conducts a concert at Carnegie Hall twice each year. He decided to use his connections with the venue to allow students a rare experience.
Rebecca Engel, a junior music education major and chorus member, is excited to be able to perform with the chorus. “Post and its accomplished faculty give us so many opportunities other schools do not get, such as performing at Carnegie Hall,” she said. This will be Engel’s third time performing at Carnegie Hall with the chorus.
“One of the things I wanted to do since I was here was try to create this opportunity, which is so rare and otherwise would be pretty much impossible,” Shapiro said. The chorus has performed more than five times at Carnegie Hall with the Cecilia Chorus under Shapiro’s guidance.
Shapiro described the detailed preparation for such a big performance, “Bach is hard. It’s a lot of curious turns of phrase that you don’t necessarily see coming, and it’s very continuous singing,” he said, “We look at the big picture and small picture.”
The chorus will perform selections from Bach’s “Christmas Oratorio,” which is entirely in German. The separate sections of the piece vary in tone, composition, and lyrics, each one expressing a different motif. Shapiro says it is important for singers to understand the meaning behind the music. “We also talk about what the pieces mean, spiritually and emotionally, and what it means to us.”
Tickets for this performance can be purchased online at www. carnegiehall.org. Prices range from $25 to $85. Contact Shapiro at mark.shapiro@liu.edu to set up an audition for the chorus, open to students of all majors.

The photography 7 class invited students to glance into brand new perspectives of the world during their exhibition titled “Foto Hypnosis.” The show ran from Nov. 28 – Dec. 2 in the S.A.L Gallery, and a reception was held Wednesday, Nov. 29.
Each photographer captured a different aspect of life through their lens. “The images are all unique series on their own, but they come together [because] they’re all entrancing and dreamlike,” Caroline Bert, a senior photography major, said.
Bert’s featured series depicted a young girl dressed in a suit blazer and tutu, commuting through life uncertain of her career path. “My series is a narrative about a little girl that’s conflicted between two big dreams,” she said. “She wants to be a ballerina, but she also wants to be a businesswoman.” The story ends with the little girl opening up a dance business. Bert incorporated physical aids with her series: worn ballet slippers, an mp3 player with headphones and a filled-out planner. She met weekly with one model to capture the story and record the young girl’s voice. This audio track, also featuring ballet music and the sounds of a big city, was playable from the mp3 player. “I did that to make the viewer feel like they’re in her world,” Bert said. “They’re hearing her voice, they’re seeing what she sees and holding her objects.”
Erin Bortel, junior photography major, displayed a series depicting “cosmic mermaids.” Using female subjects who submerged their heads in water, Bortell captured colorful abstract images from her perspective underneath a glass tank. “I used specific lighting and saturated colors to make it look like they’re in a celestial galaxy,” she said. Bortell describes the images as a cross between being underwater and in space. She has always wanted to photograph hair and explored interesting shapes within the forms it took underwater. “The colors [of hair] come out with different lighting, you can come up with different shades; it was appealing to me,” Bortell said. She hoped her photos would allow the viewers to “step out of reality and into a new one.”
David Pilcha, junior photography a major, used two 50-mm lenses, “using one to take an image through another,” he said. Pilcha aimed to redirect the viewer’s focus from the final result of a photograph, so he made the lens itself the subject of the photo.
Four different scenarios were depicted upside-down in the inner circle of the lens including a fire escape, a city worker maintaining public bikes, Christmas lights on a tree, and the interior of a subway car. “The whole beauty of using a 50-mm [lens] is that is has a low aperture that gives you what we call a ‘bokah’,” Pilcha said, describing the soft, blurred light in the background of his photos. “It has its own magic and its own charm that comes with the image,” he said. The eye-catching photos allowed viewers to either focus on the image through the lens or the background.
Friends and family of the artists gathered at the reception to view the final products of months of hard work. Some had personal involvement with the artist’s projects. Featured artist Wenkai Ji took portraits of various models, successfully capturing their personalities, according to his friend, Nomi Park. Park’s sister modeled for one of Ji’s photos, “She has a very shy personality and is introverted, and he captured the moment when she laughed,” Park said. Making the most of background colors, lighting and the positioning of the models themselves, Ji was able to communicate different stories through each photo.
Matt Gelfman titled his series “Skinscapes.” The black and white photos featured indistinguishable, nude body parts. His girlfriend, Kim Toledo, modeled for the series. “I wanted to focus on different abstract parts of the body more in the way you would tackle a landscape picture,” Gelfman said. He achieved this by layering her limbs in varying depths, similarly to how trees or mountains may be featured in the foreground of background of a photo. “I really wanted all the little details as you would in a landscape [photo],” Gelfman said. He wanted to tackle one of his weaknesses: landscape photography, so he combined it with his love of photographing people. As for why the images are all black and white, “There’s something more revealing when you’re forced to just look at the tones of shadows of highlights,” he said, “The separation provides a different perspective.”
The photographers worked all semester shooting thousands of new additions to their collections every week and critiquing the photos in class among their peers. After that, they narrowed their choices down to what fit best in the gallery and in their specific series.
Each series was comprised of four varying photographs that all related to one idea. “Everyone has their own perspective, and photography is all about perspective and light,” Bert said, “Each artist shows their own take on the theme in a different way.”

The women’s basketball team won its eighth game of the season, 87-69, against Wilmington University, in Newark, Delaware on Saturday, Dec. 2.
Senior Sasha Patterson led offense, scoring 27 points, while sophomore Mikaiya Moore scored 18 points and seven rebounds. Scoring in double-digits for the fifth game in a row, Patterson led the Pioneer offense with 27 points on 11-of-17 shooting with 14 rebounds. Moore contributed with 18 points and seven rebounds.
Senior Kylie Garrett scored 13 points, seven rebounds and two steals. “Our performance on the court is still improving,” Garrett said, adding that the team’s goals for the season are to play consistently, to improve and get better game by game. “[We] want to have everyone on the team focused on the team and not [themselves] Together is the word you could use to describe our team this year.” She said.
During the third and fourth quarters the Pioneers led the game 67-53 and wouldn’t allow Wilmington University to score. Naya Williams solidified the victory with free throws.
“Our team has played a tough schedule opening up with the first eight games on the road,” Deidre Moore, head women’s basketball coach, said. “They have played good, hard, TEAM basketball and are still improving. We always want to have a defensive mentality and yesterday in the second half we only gave up 26 points. We had multiple people with 3+ defensive rebounds, which is something we are stressing this season.
We need multiple defensive stops and the middle of the third quarter to the beginning of the fourth we were able to get multiple stops and take the lead. Wilmington was a formidable opponent and played hard. I was proud of my team’s effort and self-less play,” she added.
The team’s first home game of the season will be on Wednesday, Dec. 6 at 5 p.m. against the University of Bridgeport, at the Pratt Recreation Center.
