The Emerging Student Theatre Artists (ESTA) club began their first virtual craft fair via Instagram on Aug. 15. ESTA is a student created club that normally specializes in theatre performances like small themed cabarets all the way to full scale musicals, however they shifted focus to cater to other forms of art last Sunday.
“The ESTA craft fair was started to showcase the amazing creations that members of our club were selling,” Jaclyn Holliday, a senior musical theatre major and ESTA president, said. “We wanted to support them and their work while also highlighting to everyone in our club everything that could be bought.”
The club members worked together to make the fair happen virtually. “My co president Yaya Munoz had posted on our Facebook page asking any artist/creator who sells their work to post about it in the comments,” Holliday said. “From there I had the idea to do a craft fair on the lawn to showcase everyone’s amazing creations in person. Pearl Emerson, one of our secretaries and one of the vendors at the craft fair, then took over the project and organized it to be online.”
The craft fair mostly took place on Instagram, via the @esta.liupost accounts stories.
“We originally were going to set up booths outside and only let a certain number of people walk through at a time,” Holliday said. “However, with the COVID-19 restrictions we had to put it all online. We showcased each artist on our instagram story and then posted bundles, a combination of different vendors’ work that fit the same theme, on our Facebook page to be auctioned off. We had a starting bid for everything and gave everyone 24 hours to put their bid in. Then the highest bidder got the bundle.” 
For those who missed the fair, ESTA is unsure of plans to make another event for selling handmade items, but encourage students to follow their social media to gain insight on their future shows and events.

This semester, Promise will release a brand new platform for students and clubs on campus. This new website, Experience Shark Nation, is a more accessible way for students to stay involved with clubs and events happening on campus. The platform states that “getting connected to opportunities, experiences, and the LIU Community has never been easier.”
Experience Shark Nation is branded as a place for both students and clubs to find information and events. Students can use the service to “Find or create a club, get involved in service, and receive Shark Points that can be cashed in for LIU Gear and other prizes,” according to the Shark Nation website. Though it is not yet being advertised to students, clubs have trained on how to use it. 
“[Promise] went over it at club training and walked us through some of its features and how to create a profile for our club. I think it’s easy to access and easy to navigate,” senior psychology major Nicole Ludwig and president of the Rainbow Alliance said.
On Sept. 18, Promise held a meeting for the e-boards of every club on campus. At this meeting, Promise presented the e-boards with the new COVID-19 guidelines for club events as well as a walk-through of Experience Shark Nation.
The new platform has more features and a new streamlined design compared to the old platform that it is replacing.
“The last platform was a TinyURL link where a bunch of important links were listed,” Ludwig said. “It wasn’t set up somewhat like a social media site like this one, it was just a bunch of links.” 
Senior musical theatre major, and president of the Emerging Student Theatre Artists club, Jaclyn Holiday is also a fan of the new design.
“The old website was specifically for submitting forms whereas on the new website you get to see all the different clubs and what they’re up to,” Holiday said. “This layout is much more concise and organized.”
Club leaders are using this website to reach out to students on campus. With COVID-19 regulations, there is an added challenge to clubs trying to recruit new members. 
“[The Coalition for Conservation] will be using it to list events and act as a means to connect with potential members,” Julie Williams, a junior acting major and president of The Coalition for Conservation club, said.

Since the beginning of the fall semester, several students have noticed the appearance of small, yellow, rubber ducks across campus. The scavenged ducks were each marked with a number as well as the name of an Instagram account: LIU.dux. The account is the source of the mysterious ducks strewn about campus, and posts photos of the duck-discoverers. Several students have already found the elusive ducks that directed them to the Instagram page.
“I found out about the account when I got lost on campus actually. I had gotten turned around and ended up at the labyrinth I think,” Jenna Fisk, a freshman digital art and design major said. “I thought it looked pretty and was there early so I did some exploring and found the duck on the staircase, then found the account because of the writing on it.”
Katie Zarka, a sophomore art therapy major, said that they “saw the LIU.dux account at first on Instagram,” and that they “found [their] duck over at Winnick Mansion next to the rose garden.” Zarka found duck #70. 
Similarly, Kara de Bruin, a freshman childhood education major, said they heard about the account from a friend and ended up finding their duck on a sign around campus. 
Shayla Kaim, a freshman childhood education major, found one of the elusive ducks when she was walking with her brother.
“My brother and I had no clue about the whole situation,” Kaim said. “We were actually just walking and spotted the duck on a picture frame in the basement of the library, we saw the duck had the #liudux on it so we searched it up and found the Instagram page.”
Despite the numerous duck findings, the LIU.dux Instagram page said that they have “98 [that] need to be found.” The owner of the account is not known, nor is the purpose of the ducks aside from being an entertaining activity to liven up the campus, but they remain active in updating their audience on the status of located ducks. Not to worry; the ducks wear masks to adhere to campus policy.

Summer 2020 sparked many conversations about life in America, with one of the most prominent ones being social justice and diversity. Protests for the Black Lives Matter movement continue on across America, and here on our campus, the athletic department has launched an initiative to support and amplify many of the diverse voices of our student athletes. Athletes have never just been solely athletes, and the university is giving a platform to student athletes to speak up about what they believe in. 
Beginning with the hashtag #LIUsingOurVoice on both Instagram and Twitter, the athletic department has announced the movement as a “student-driven social media initiative,” taking the lead from many professional athletes to speak out about injustices in society. Over the course of the school year, many student athletes will comment about what the initiative means to them and how people can take action. 
The first comment for #LIUsingOurVoice is from sophomore Noah Anderson, who said “Black lives matter. My Black life matters. I want to feel as though our black lives are valued, and not feared or condemned. I see myself in Tamir Rice. I see myself in Trayvon Martin. I see myself in Philando Castile. I remember being pulled over for a dim tail light and being asked to step out of the car by the officer. I remember not thinking whether or not I had done something wrong but if I would make it home that night.” 
The athletics department is doing what they can to encourage more athletes to share their experiences.
“Liking and sharing and commenting on the posts is the most impactful thing to do to support the initiative,” director of media relations and assistant athletic director Casey Snedecor said. “And follow LIU Athletics. Engagement on those posts helps those athletes see that their voices are being heard and that they matter, and that’s the goal of the initiative in the first place. We’d also love for athletes to continue to submit their experiences- it won’t be a very long program if nobody shares anything.”
The link for submission is in the @liuathletics Instagram bio. 
This initiative is just one way that the administration is supporting student athletes, but it is one of the most valuable.
“I think it’s important to highlight and support our athletes. We try to do that always with our department accounts, but this has given us a chance to spotlight issues that matter to them,” Snedecor said. “Athletes’ voices have never been more impactful, and I think it’s important that the department and the university supports and encourages Sharks using their voices to impact positive social change. Social media is an easy avenue that we can use to amplify their voices, so I hope that #LIUsingOurVoices becomes a way that our athletes feel like they can speak up.” 

The @liuathleteics Instagram page states that #LIUsingOurVoice is “about amplifying what matters to our sharks, and celebrating what makes us who we are.” 
Learn about the experiences of Post athletes on Instagram and Twitter through the tag #LIUsingOurVoice.

The university has launched an online dashboard to track cases of COVID-19 on campus. This comes shortly after the creation of New York state’s “COVID-19 Report Card,” an interactive website that showcases how many positive COVID-19 cases are in schools around the state.
The university’s dashboard shows how many positive cases have been reported daily, and how many cases have been reported in the current two week period. Reopening guidance issued by Governor Andrew Cuomo states that any university in New York must have less than one hundred positive cases within the span of two weeks, otherwise they must transition to online learning.
The goal of the dashboard is to keep the campus community informed about updates relating to COVID-19 on campus according to Chief Administrative Officer Joseph Schaefer and Chief of Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement Michael Berthel. 
“That’s our commitment to the community,” Berthel said “that we’re going to keep people updated and informed as we progress throughout the semester.”
The dashboard will be updated daily, and will show all positive cases reported relating to members of the campus community, regardless where they receive their test results, according to Berthel.
The dashboard was given a rating of “C+” by “We Rate Covid Dashboards,” a website run by two Yale University School of Public Health professors who evaluate different universities COVID-19 dashboards. The rating was updated from the universities previous rating of “F” for not having a dashboard available.
The New York state “COVID-19 Report Card” website features detailed information about the virus’s impact on campus such as, the amount of testing done on campus, how many students are currently quarantined and how many hospitalizations have occurred as a result of the virus.
Information for the “COVID-19 Report Card” website is provided by universities, local health departments and testing locations, according to Governor Cuomo.
During the two week period from Sept.12 through Sept.25 the Post campus had a total of five positive cases, with an additional case reported on the Brooklyn campus, according to the university’s dashboard.
This number contradicts the New York state “COVID-19 Report Card” which states that the Post campus had a total of eight cases from Sept.12 through Sept.25. This discrepancy is because the university initially reported all positive cases to date to the Department of Health, according to Berthel. 
Berthel is hopeful for the remainder of the semester, but stresses that it will take a community commitment to stop the spread of COVID-19.
“If you look at the last two week period which ended this past weekend we were able to keep cases relatively low, which is a really good thing and I think a sign of a lot of success from good protocols and practices being in place, and also vigilance on behalf of the community,” Berthel said. “Wearing masks, social distancing and respecting one another, that’s all key to that as well.”
The university had previously been issuing COVID-19 related updates through email alerts and text messages to students. All of the university’s previous messages, as well as new updates, are available to read online on the “Coronavirus Update” section of the Long Island University website.
