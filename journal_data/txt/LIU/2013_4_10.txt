Senior Broadcasting major, Joshua Manning, is this year’s Post Idol Winner! This event is in its fifth season and was hosted by Association for Campus Programming (ACP), Lambda Sigma Upsilon Fraternity Incorporated and Sigma Delta Phi Epsilon Incorporated. Throughout the event, which was held in the Hillwood Auditorium, members of the audience were able to live tweet with the hash tag #postidol2013.
The night started off with hosts, Eric Zirlinger, Jesus Cardenas, and Shaun Jackson welcoming the members of the audience as well as judges Alerie Tirsch, Fernando Mendoza and Jahmel Green. The first contestant was freshman, Talilah Meredith, wearing a royal blue dress; she gave her rendition of Beyonce’s “I Was Here.” Green and Tirsch were slightly harsh in their critics, however, Mendoza said it was her best performance.
Up next was senior Music Education major, Stephanie Eso, who belted out Miguel’s “Sure Thing.” All judges agreed that Stephanie had a great stage presence and really con- nected with the audience. Eso tweeted after her performance, “Thank you guys for all the support!! Amazing Crowd!!! #PostIdol2013.”
Manning was up next, singing Miguel’s “Adorn.” Before he started his performance, he asked all of the ladies in the crowd to come down into the first row and he proceeded to sing his song to them. Members of the crowd tweeted things like, “There’s a new Manning running New York: Josh Manning,” and, “Joshua is singing at my wedding.”
Unfortunately for Meredith, she was the first to leave the competition. The judges decided that Eso and Manning would be the final two to sing to the death. Eso started off with Alicia Keys’ “No One.” Again, Eso had the audience in the palm of her hands. Judges agreed and thought this was a better suited song for her vocal range.
Manning followed that up with Brian McKnight’s “Back At One.” Members of the audience were singing along to the classic 90’s R&B song while clapping and waving their arms back and forth to the beat.
Now it came down to the audience. They were to decide who was going to become the next Post Idol and open up for Spring Fling talent, Miguel. It was a close race as both per- formers captured the audience but Manning took the title.
“I thought it was a great event and the crowd participation was awesome. The competition was neck and neck which made the event more dramatic,” said senior Broadcasting major, Nick Ciborowski.
Marissa Lando, also a senior Broadcasting major, agreed saying, “All the finalists were really so talented. Stephanie has such a powerful and unique voice that is definitely hard to come by. And Josh has a warmth and power and energy behind his singing that is just so enjoyable to listen to. I would go to the Miguel concert just to see him open.”
After the win, Manning said, “It’s cool, I’m excited and a little bit intimidated to open up for Miguel because he’s a super star.” When it came to his competitors he said they were both great; he loved Meredith’s performance and Eso was very energetic. As for what he plans on singing to open up for the Spring Fling concert, he has no clue. He asked readers to send him any suggestions! You can hear Manning’s pipes again at the Miguel Concert on April 20 in the Tilles Center.

Do you know that you can manage your own garden at Post? It is now time to sign up for a 10’ x 15’ plot on the campus’ south side, through a campus community outreach initiative called Operation Community Garden. It will be an opportunity to meet new friends, learn about the environment, and to grow this summer’s vegetables on your own.
The Department of Facilities Services runs the program, which started in 1997, as a part of the university’s community outreach. Today staff, faculty and students that work, study or live on campus, can join as individuals or in groups to become campus gardeners in their free time. “The Community Garden not only enhances the beauty of the campus, it gives us a deeper appreciation of the environment, natural resources, fresh produce and nutrition,” said Provost Paul Forestell.
Rita Langdon, Director of Public Relations and a community gardener, said that between 50-60 students, staff and faculty members participate every year, and that it is a giving experience to join. “Not everyone has a garden at home and some people live in apartments or dorms,” she said. “Gardening is a really positive way to bring people together and promote awareness of environmental preservation, healthy eating and natural resources.” A great time to take care of your plants, herbs or vegetables is during common hour. “Some tend to their garden during lunch break as a way to get some fresh air and relax between classes,” Langdon said.
Judith Chiaravalle, Assistant Director of Transfer Admissions and a Master of Business Administration graduate student, joined to harvest her own crops. “I’m a vegetarian and knowing where my main source of food comes from is very important to me,” she said. “It was a lot harder than I expected, but the results were really rewarding. Making dinner with vegetables that I’ve grown was such a feeling!” she added.
Cultivating your own crops, rather than purchasing them at the store, is a good way to promote environmental and ecological choices. Operation Community Garden works to encourage environmental-friendly cultivation. The gardeners are asked to use organic products instead of harmful pesticides and fertilizers, and the plots are prepared and composted with horse bedding and leaves collected on campus. Water is also available, but the gardeners must provide most equipment. “Having a garden takes much time and you have to weed, harvest and water daily, which is a big commitment that can get expensive. The largest costs come in the beginning when you have to buy plants and tools, which can exceed $80,” Chiara- valle said. “But if you join with someone else to split the plot, then you can cut the costs and work in half,” she added.
Taking care of the garden can be time-consuming, but what happens to the plot when you go away for a few days or longer? Christmas break is one month and the summer break almost four. Case Joosse, Post’s Grounds Manager and a horticulturist, said that there are no worries. “Staff can occasionally look over the plots and contact the gardener if there would be any problems, but we also encourage the participants to help each other out,” he said. “When one gardener leaves, another gardener can look after the plot for a while,” he added.
Sofie Hoff, a junior Fine Arts major, received an e-mail about the program recently and finds the initiative interesting, but still has doubts about joining. “I believe taking care of a garden plot would take time that many students don’t have,” she said. “And it could also get costly if you need to provide equipment yourself. I live on campus and I don’t know if I have room for anything more in my dorm room either,” she added.
So how do you join the program? Last week the Provost sent out e-mails to the campus community that included a participant’s form. Fill in your name, number and return it to the Facilities Services Department, located by the Public Safety building. Based on a first-come, first-serve basis, individuals or groups will be able to stake out their desired plot within a few weeks and both returning and new participants are expected to join. The plots are located on the campus’ south close to the sports fields and equestrian center. For more information, contact Facilities Services at (516) 299 2277.

If you have been to Penn Station recently, I’m sure you have noticed all of the ads for Long Island University. There are 70 ads in Penn station alone, viewable in the Long Island Railroad waiting room, railroad platforms, escalators, lobbies, corridors, hall- ways, and stairwell. LIU has definitely dominated Penn Station.
Yet, I don’t think these ads will make a huge difference in our enrollment. 7,305 graduate and undergraduate students were enrolled at Post in 2011. 7,126 graduate and undergraduate students were enrolled in the fall of 2012. That’s 179 fewer students enrolled, nine months after the rebranding campaign began. Will a picture of a random unknown student, with the caption “Find out how good you really are” persuade people in making the choice to attend a college? I don’t even think Post itself is too confident in our ads boosting enrollment, especially since they are shutting down Kings Hall next year and offering single housing.
Why is all this money being spent on advertisement? The money that is being dumped into these obnoxious ads could be used to improve our campus, the place many of us call home. We have crumbling stairs between Brookville Hall and the Suites, Chipmunk Trail still has fallen trees from October’s Hurricane Sandy, the walkway by the chapel needs to be paved, the dorm buildings don’t have wifi, the parking lot behind the suites is still ripped up, washers and dryers go months with an “out of service” sign taped to them, the game rooms have stained carpets, some of our classrooms have old desks, many students complain about the dining situation on campus, and not to mention that some of our university signs here on Long Island, still have not been changed from C.W. to LIU.
“Definitely, it would be better if all the money spent on advertising could be spent on our school, because I feel like, as a student, we still have a lot of things for our use [that] could be better. Like the classroom and all that stuff could be more updated,” said Ada Lee, a senior Clinical Laboratory major. “Advertis- ing does help, but is it necessary for all over? I think it is something that we need to be con- cerned about. Advertising is good, but not that much. We should cut off some.”
“They should be spending it on better stuff; they shouldn’t be wasting our money on advertisement in Penn Station,” said Ketan Parmar, a freshman Computer Science major. “They should be spending it more on our education and our food, something that helps us as students. They should improve the media lab and the computer lab; just have more resources available for us. That’d be nice. They should make the dorms a little nicer, cleaner, and smell nicer too. That’d be great.”
Will these ads bring the results that the University is hoping for? Parmar offers his pros and cons regarding the university’s intensive advertising campaign. “Yes and no. Yes in the way that it tells people we’re here, we’re alive, we are Post, we got Post pride. But no, because we are wasting our money, we really don’t need to endorse that much.” It is hard to say whether or not all these ads will make people pick our school over another. Having great ads to represent us is nice, but you should fix things at the home base first instead of paying all this money to put ads not just in Penn Station, but also in Herald Square; billboards; Times Square; LIRR cars; the Theatre District; bus shelters in Suffolk, Nassau, Queens; NYC subway cars; malls (Roosevelt, Broadway and Walt Whitman); and newspapers.

After a musical hiatus dating back to 2006, Justin Timberlake is back! On March 19, JT released his newest album entitled The 20/20 Experience. This is his third studio album and the last since Future Sex/ Love Sounds.
Timberlake’s comeback album sold 968,000 copies in its first week to the public. That represents the big- gest sales debut of any album since Taylor Swift’s Red sold 1.2 million copies in November.
The former *NSYNC member did not divert away from doing what separates him from the rest of the music industry. Of Timberlake’s 12 songs on the track (two bonus songs), seven of them are longer than seven minutes in length, and three are at least eight minutes. So if you expected to listen to the entire album during one sitting, re-think that idea…unless you tend to sit for very long periods of time…then this album is absolutely perfect for you!
I felt that The 20/20 Experience was Timberlake at his finest. Classic JT. He released “Suit & Tie” featuring Jay-Z back in January. I’ll admit it: I was not a huge fan when this song first hit the airwaves. But it has grown on me. JT and Jay-Z have a nice chemistry together and I think they’ll give plenty of entertainment to fans on their upcoming tour together.
Shortly after releasing “Suit & Tie,” Timberlake unveiled what I believe to be the best song on the album: “Mirrors.” The song starts out with a dramatic feel, with anticipation building. Then Timberlake takes over and takes you through a symbolic journey about the mirror, the other half, in his life. Of course, he is speak- ing about his wife, Jessica Biel.
The high point of the song is mid-way through when the beat drops and all that’s left is essentially Timberlake’s voice with the occasional clap and beat of a drum. He then goes on and proclaims that “You are the love of my life” ten straight times which leads into:
Now you’re the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it’s already gone
And I can’t wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are (the love of my life)
This song has gained a tremendous amount of airtime as of late, and recently, JT also released the music video to “Mirrors.” I don’t want to get into specifics, but the video was very, very hard to follow. However, it was incredibly interesting and holds your attention, to say the least.
Another personal favorite of mine is “Pusher Love Girl.” The first 30 seconds of the song gives off a Disney-movie-like feel of instrumen- tals, and then shifts into Timberlake comparing a lover to a drug pusher. Although it may not sound like the most pleasant comparison, it’s a catchy song and definitely has the tendency to get stuck in your head for an extended period of time. Oh, and if you want to hear JT hit more than a few high notes, this is the song for you! The only negative thing I’d point out about this song is that there really is no need for the song to be over eight minutes long. This one can easily be shaved down to four minutes!
A song to which I’ve heard some difference in opinion is “Strawberry Bubblegum.” The song starts off very slow with a deep voice, Barry White- esque, in the background sounding all sexual and whatnot. This leads into Timberlake doing his thing, saying:
Baby please don’t change nothing Because your flavor’s so original And it all started when she said Hey hey hey, smacking that
Strawberry Bubblegum You really got me when you said Hey hey hey, popping that
Strawberry Bubblegum
However, at the 5:00 mark, the song morphs into a baby-making joint. So if that’s your thing, fast-forward to five minutes, light some candles, turn the lights low, and proceed.
With The 20/20 Experience, Timberlake stuck to what makes him such a distinctive artist. His come- back was a success as he is at the top of the game right now. Even his bonus tracks “Dress On” and “Body Count” are quite addicting. If you haven’t already, take a listen to the album. You’ll be happy you did!

LIU Post’s men’s lacrosse team had 12 different players score in their 18-1 drubbing of the
Dominican College Chargers on Saturday, April 6.
The Pioneers quickly opened up the scoring, as senior attacker Justin Patter- son scored the Pioneers first goal at 11:40. Two minutes later, senior midfielder Chris Ruhlig made it 2-0 LIU Post. Senior defenseman J.D. Skura recorded his first goal of the season to make it 3-0, and with 22 seconds left in the first quarter sophomore Connor Drost made it 4-0.
The scoring onslaught continued into the second quarter. Freshman Ryan Slane, who fin- ished the contest with a game high five goals, scored at the 9:02 mark of the quarter. Less than a minute later freshman midfielder Anthony Berardis made it 6-0 Pioneers.
Slane scored two more goals before the end of the half. Both goals came with the Pioneers down a man.
Drost tallied his second goal of the afternoon at 13:47 of the third quarter to make it
9-0 in favor of LIU Post. The Pioneers scored five more goals before the Chargers finally got on the scoreboard. It was fresh- man attacker Joseph Ravenell who scored for Dominican Col- lege at the 10:04 mark of the fourth quarter. The goal came up on a man-up opportunity for the Chargers.
But the Pioneers went right back to work minutes later as Slane scored his fifth goal of the game at the 6:55 mark. Siblings Robby and John Cegielski each tallied their first goals of the season less than a minute apart from one another. Freshman attacker Mike Chimenti then scored with 1:12 left in the game to make it 18-1.
The win was the Pioneers’ most heavy-handed victory of the season. LIU Post outshot the Chargers 62-21, keeping their opponent to just two shots in the first quarter. The Pioneers also held an advan- tage in ground balls, picking up 51 to the Chargers 36.
LIU Post now has a record of 8-1 on the season and a perfect 4-0 record in the East Coast Conference. They will face the Mercyhurst Maver- icks next at home on Saturday, April 13 at 12 p.m.

Tom Galeazzi, a former C.W. Post men’s basketball head coach in the Hall of Fame, passed away on Saturday, April 6.
Galeazzi spent 25 years at the helm of the Pioneers’ men’s basketball team, and over that span he owned a record of 466-260. He also coached the Pioneers to nine NCAA Division II Regional appearances, as well as ten NYAC championships. During his watch the Pioneers also made three round-of-16 appearances and an Elite Eight appearance in 1986.
Under Galeazzi, LIU Post had 11, 21-plus-win seasons and his Pioneer teams recorded back-to-back 25-win seasons in 2002-03 and 2003-04.
Prior to coaching the Pioneers, Galeazzi spent four seasons coaching at Suffolk Community College from 1966 to 1970. He also spent 11 years coaching at SUNY Farmingdale from 1970 to 1981.
In August 1996, Galeazzi was inducted into the New York State Bas- ketball Hall of Fame in Glen Falls, New York. He is also a member of the Farmingdale Athletics Hall of Fame, and he was selected as one of the members of the 2013 LIU Post Athletics Hall of Fame Class.
“The LIU community is saddened to hear of the sudden death of our former beloved basketball coach Tom Galeazzi,” Athletic Director Bryan Collins told the LIU Post’s athletics website. “His Hall of Fame career touched the lives of so many student-athletes as well as the entire LIU Post community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Galeazzi family.”
Galeazzi is survived by his fiancée, Gale, two sons, Richard and Robert, and his grandchildren.

Julia Rosén Staff Writer
With graduation only four weeks away for the seniors at LIU Post, some students are choosing to take a break from school and work, while others are going directly to graduate school. The choice between work and school is hard, however choosing the right graduate school, once you’ve decided to con- tinue your studies, might be even harder. The decision to further your studies should not be taken lightly. Matters like paying your tuition and having the discipline to stay focused on school must be considered first. There is a lot to consider, but foremost, be sure to weigh the pros and cons of graduate school.
Before continuing with your education, you should first know if your desired profession requires a higher level than an under- graduate degree. In some professions, it is a necessity for getting a job, and starting a career, while in others, it is just a plus. For example, if you want to work as an artist, a graduate degree is usually not required, since it is your skills and talents that will get you a job. However, if you want to become a doctor, you have to go to medical school to get a license to practice medicine and therefore graduate school is a must.
Alea Rahim, who graduated from Post in the spring of 2012 with a BFA in Print and Electronic Journalism, decided to continue with her studies right away. As an international student from Malaysia, she had to continue her studies in order to stay in the United States. Rahim said, “In my situation, I didn’t have much of a choice in taking a break after receiving my BFA. However, if I did have the chance, I would still have gone right in to my Master’s.” Rahim is now studying Writing and Producing for Television, at the LIU Brooklyn campus.
The choice to pick that particular program was hard for Rahim, and at first she intended to continue with her studies in Journalism. “As I started to learn more about my abilities and about myself, I found that I geared towards the creative aspect of writing and was writing scripts on the side.” Rahim continued, “I felt relieved when I joined grad school. It sifted out those less interested and determined and placed a fairly small group of passionate individuals varying in age, educational background, and life experiences. So not only are you learning in class, but you are receiving lessons from the people around you. Grad school raises the bar in education.” Rahim says that she now goes to class at Steiner Studios and there, she is surrounded by professionals in her field, which allows her and her classmates to collaborate and act as if they are real writers. She says that she thoroughly enjoys class and that she is now always looking forward to it.
“In comparison to my undergraduate career,” Rahim said. “I find that my graduate studies are obviously more beneficial. I have started seriously collaborating with some of my classmates for projects out of class and I believe that I wouldn’t have had that opportunity as an undergraduate. What lacks in undergrad that you find more in grad school is passion. And you want to surround yourself with that or there’s no point in furthering your studies.” Rahim believes that every person is different, and there is no right answer on whether or not to go directly to Graduate School or not. She would recommend to those that are not sure as to what they want to do after their undergraduate degree, to take a break and find out what they want to do with life. “I mean, it’s an extra two years at another institution so you better be certain that’s what you’d like to get yourself into. Otherwise, you’re not only wasting your time, but every- one else’s in the class too,” said Rahim.
Elina Viitasaari, a senior with a double-major in Psychology and Criminal Justice, has chosen to go home to her home country, Finland, to work and then continue her studies. Viitasaari stated, “I have to work [a] little bit before going for a Masters in order to get the student loans a little smaller. So I’m mov- ing back to Finland. I’m now in the process of waiting to hear from different places to which I applied.”
Viitasaari’s plan after working is to apply for the Forensic Psychology program at the University of Helsinki. In Viitasaari’s case, money was an issue, but she wouldn’t mind going directly back to school either. “Guidance counselors don’t really suggest taking a break, but I don’t see any problem with that. After high school, I took three years off in order to do my military service and to work. I love studying, so for me the break always just makes me more motivated to go back to school but I’ve heard opposite story as well when people get too comfortable with their current jobs. I think you just need to do what you think is the best for you and what your life situation allows you to do.”
T.K. Wu, a senior Film major, does not feel graduate school is important for him. “School isn’t really important for me in the first place,” said Wu. “I’m a film major and unfortunately I don’t think film is something that can be taught at school. It solely relies on on-set experience and connections. Graduate school or even undergraduate school is not at all important in this field. Therefore, no, I won’t be going to grad school.”
Whether or not you are ready for graduate school, it is good to look at your choices and whether or not you are ready to give a couple of more years to educating yourself further. It is not always so easy to know what you want to do, but it is important to remember that it is okay to take a break to ensure you are making the right decision. For me, graduate school is something I want to pursue immediately after my undergraduate degree. However, what exactly I want to do is still not clear. I know I have time to figure that out. Right now, I am enjoying my time at Post and, hopefully, the pieces will fall into place by themselves.

After completing its third consecutive double-header sweep, the LIU Post softball team has won six games in a row and boasts a 22-9 record. Most recently, the Pioneers dominated Dominican College on Sunday, April 7. The Pioneers cruised to an 11-2 victory and an 8-1 win on the road against the Chargers (14-14).
In the first contest, the Pioneers scored in every inning of play. Junior shortstop Nicole Hagenah got the Pioneers on the board in the first inning with a two-run homerun, her first of the campaign. The following inning, junior pitcher Liz Weber hit her fourth homerun of the season giving the Pioneers a 3-0 advantage.
In the fifth inning, Hagenah put the finishing touches on the game with her second two-run homerun of the game. She ended the game 2-3 with 2 HR’s, 3 runs and 4 RBI’s.
Junior centerfielder Alexis Gonzalez saw some pitches to hit as she batted in front of Hagenah. Gonzalez went 2-3 with 3 runs and 3 RBI’s.
Dominican College was unable to muster up any offense as the Chargers nearly had as many errors, three, as they did hits, four. They actually finished with one more error than runs scored.
The second game of the double-dip was more of the same for both squads. Although the Chargers began the game with the lead in the early going, a four-run third inning sparked an already hot Pioneers offense. Gonzalez, Hagenah, freshman third baseman Kelsey McLaughlin, and junior rightfielder Jessica Julich each recorded an RBI in the inning giving the Pioneers a 4-1 lead to work with.
Pioneers’ sophomore pitcher Megan Salcido (6-1) did not need any more insurance runs as she delivered a performance that all but shut down the Chargers. She threw four innings, allowing only four hits and the one earned run in the second inning. Freshman pitcher Quincy Lewis netted her first save as she tossed three innings of no-hit ball, walking only one batter in the process.
The Pioneers tacked on four runs over the final two innings of play highlighted by freshman second baseman Maria Palmeri’s solo home- run in the sixth inning. With her fourth homerun of the season, Palmeri continued her five-game hitting streak.
Weber, hitting .426 for the season, has a hit in six consecutive games, as well as an RBI in four straight games.
The Pioneers return to play on Thursday, April 11 on the road against NYIT (8-18) with a double-header. First pitch for the opener begins at 3 p.m. and the second game is scheduled for a 5 p.m. start. The Pioneers will aim to continue their hot play in the ECC as they own a 7-1 conference record.

She has gotten out of control. Does she even see it? She posts questionable pictures on her Facebook profile. I hear rumors about her. She looks high every time I see her. She needs help. I should help, but I don’t know how. She hasn’t talked to me since the last time we hung out. Which was… last summer? Is it my problem then? Does she even count as my friend anymore? I’m just going to leave it up to her family and her “new” friends. If she really wanted me to have a meaningful spot in her life, she would let me know.
We all know somebody who needs help. But how often do we actually make an effort to help them? This story isn’t about a specific girl, but this is usually how the story goes. We tend to leave it up to their other friends and families instead of trying to give the person who used to be or still may be, our friend, a helping hand.
Yet, I truly believe in helping a friend out.
It shouldn’t take much of your time and energy, and if it does, you have gone too far. Know your limit. Start with getting that friend to talk to you. Learn how to be a good listener. Often people just need somebody who is willing to listen. If they tell you something you don’t agree with, try not to be judgmental. That’s not why they decided to open up to you. Remember, if they tell you their story in the first place, it’s because they trust you.
Don’t interrupt and say, “I know how you feel.” Maybe you have been in their spot before, but the truth is, you don’t know how your friend feels. We’re talking about their feelings, not yours, and how you felt. Ask, “How do you feel?” instead and let them tell you about it.
Find out why that person ended up where he or she is today. Did something happen? Or was it just temptations getting out of hand? Suggest ideas to lead them in the right direction.
Sophomore and Graphic Design major, Ashley Ieveno, said she would do whatever she could to help a struggling friend. She would first try to convince them to look at the lifestyle they’re creating for themselves. “If it continues, things are going to spiral downward,” Ieveno said. She would want her friends to help her if she was in that same situation.
Junior and Finance major, Christoffer Andersson, looked at how bad a drug/alcohol problem could turn out if they brought their problem to school or a public place, and their dose was too much for their body to handle. Andersson pictured himself in that situation and how he would help out. “If the incident occurred at school, I would call the school paramedics. If it occurred in public, I would probably call an ambulance,” said Andersson.
And let’s be honest, Andersson’s overdose-scenario could happen if the person doesn’t get help in time.
However, you don’t have to be the only one the troubled girl or boy has to rely on. Suggest counseling, which the school of- fers for free. Call the Counseling Services office, 516-299-2345, or if it’s an emergency, call 516-299- 2222, which is open 24/7.
All in all, think about it be- fore you decide that it isn’t your problem. What if this person was you?

Resident students are voicing their concerns about the unsanitary bathrooms in the dorms on campus. However, Jennifer Fuoco, director of Residence Life, said that the dorms, including the bathrooms, are a healthy environment for students.
“The bathrooms—I can go off about [that],” said a freshman Dance major who dorms in Queens Hall. “There is hair all over the place, the toilet is always clogged, girls leave their used tampons in the shower and people leave their soap, toothpaste and panties all over,” she added about the bathroom, which is on the second floor in the building.
Some students reported similar descriptions of bathrooms in other buildings as well. “All the showers have hair in them and the toilets are never flushed,” said Victoria Brady, a sophomore Psychology major, who used to live in Brookville Hall but now lives off campus.
William Kirker, director of the Facilities Department, thinks that this is because people are using the bathrooms more frequently than they are being cleaned. “They’re [the bathrooms] cleaned daily. They get cleaned and disinfected every day. We’re not there 24 hours a day, so when people make a mess of them people may think they are not clean, but they are,” he said.
Fuoco added that, “When there is any damage done in the residence halls that exceeds every day wear and tear, the community is financially responsible for that damage. This semester, there have not been any community bills due to bathroom cleanliness.”
Although many students say the bathrooms are unclean, custodial staff, according to Fuoco, cleans them daily. “Every night at 8 or 9 p.m., I see someone clean- ing the bathroom, and it takes her a really long time,” said Deanna Albro, a freshman Music Education major.
Albro added that she felt that last semester was a little worse when it came to the cleanliness of the bathrooms in the dorms; the Residence Assistants (RAs) on her floor held a meeting and told the residents to clean up after themselves. “It got a little better, but not much,” she said about the bath- room on her floor of Queens Hall.
Muniz, who felt the Queens Hall bathrooms were not clean, said, however, the buildings are overall clean, and added that “it’s just the residents [the students who use the bathrooms are messy].”
“We encourage residents to treat the bathroom on their floor or wing just as they would their bathroom at home. Most residents are respectful of their neighbors and keep their community clean,” Fuoco said. “We also encourage our resident students to take an active role in the upkeep of their community and to let staff know if they see anything that needs to be addressed,” said Fuoco.
Although the residents said that the messiness of some of the other students that share their bathrooms are a big part of the problem, they have reported more significant health concerns, including bugs and mold.
“Queens Hall has a stink bug infestation,” said Brady. Stink bugs are a dark colored, triangular bug that emits a strong odor when threatened and are not harmful to humans.
However, according to Kirker, to the Facilities Department’s knowledge there isn’t a problem with the cleanliness of the dorms.“ If they [the students] are saying that they are not clean, I’d like to know where because they get cleaned by professionals every day,” he added.
The Health Sciences Department and Nursing Department declined to comment about the health issues raised by students living in the dorms because they don’t go in the residence halls. The Nassau County Department of Health also declined The Pioneer’s request for comment.
According to the New York State Dormitory Authority, after they build the dorms whatever goes on in them is the responsibility of the university.

Are you tired of ironing your shirts? Do you feel ironing does not challenge you just as much as it did back when you were 14? Well, then Extreme Ironing might help bring the spark back.
It is no secret that ironing is one of the household things you try to avoid at all costs. Nothing is as boring as putting up the ironing board and ironing your clothes after you washed them. Still, it is necessary. We felt the same way about do- ing our dishes by hand, so we developed the dishwashing machine, but we have not found a satisfying way of making ironing easier. What do we do when we can’t make things easier? We challenge ourselves and make it harder.
Yet again we cross the Atlantic Ocean and find the purists of the sport in the United Kingdom. In 1997 Phil Shaw came home from a long day at work, and had planned a day out rock climbing, but a stack of shirts needed to be ironed before he could leave. That’s when he realized, why don’t just combine the two activities and make it into an extreme sport? In June 1999 Shaw had developed the idea enough to head on an international tour to promote the sport.
The concept is simple; you bring an iron board, an iron and a shirt that has wrinkles to a remote location and iron the clothing. Some of the locations where such performance has taken place include in a canoe, while skiing, in the middle of the M1 Motorway and whilst parachuting. Still many claim the ulti- mate Extreme Ironing experience is bun- gee jumping ironing.
In 2002 the first, and the only known, Extreme Ironing World Championship took place in a small village near Munich in Germany. Competitors from 10 different nations competed for the first Championship title. The competition was divided into five different categories, and the contestants were supposed to find the most creative ways in each of the five chal- lenging environments. The judges test the teams on creative ironing skills as well as the creases in the clothing. Urban, Water, Forest, Rocky and Freestyle were the five environments used to crown the first world champion. It was the British team who took the title home winning a trip to Hawaii, washing machines and other household supplies in the process. The Extreme Ironing Bureau, EIB, is now in charge of approving world record attempts, and hands out the awards and recognition to Extreme Ironers all over the world. In 2011 William Hinton was recognized for his ironing along the Appalachian Trail on the American East Coast, and in 2003 the Rowenta Trophy was awarded to a group from South Africa for ironing across a gorge at the Wolfberg Cracks.
If you want to bring your ironing to the next level, you can submit your pictures to the EIB and other more local Extreme Ironing Organizations for the chance to take home other awards. In New York, the Hudson Valley Hikers have started the first Extreme Ironing USA division. They have al- ready had their first tryout to make the team, and will host more throughout the spring. They require that you bring your own irons, ironing board and a long enough extension cord. They hike around in the area and take spectacular pictures. Please visit www.hudsonvallyhikers.com for more information.
If you want to prepare for the tryouts in your local community, bring out you ironing board and start choosing more challenging locations for your Sunday morning ironing ritual. The roof of the garage, on top of your moving car or on the local playground could be appropriate places to start. Just remember to have a long enough extension cord, enough wrinkled shirts and as always; don’t mix alcohol with extreme ironing.

As a mild fan of the book, The Host, I was disappointed with the theatrical adaptation. I wondered how the 619-page novel by Stephanie Meyer would translate to the big screen but unfortunately, it did not translate well. Directed and written by Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show, In Time), The Host is unfortunately a poorly written, extremely long and tedious movie.
The film is an Invasion of the Body Snatchers style tale told from the point of view of the alien. It follows Wanderer (Saoirse Ronan) who was just implanted into her host body Melanie. The host’s mind is strong enough to be present even after being taking over by the alien. This is one of the forces that make this movie appealing.
The idea is interesting and original enough but one of the reasons it just does not work as a movie is the annoying dialogue that takes place inside the character’s mind. The problem is not Ronan’s performance, but the voiceover that is used. It is cheesy and looks silly especially when Ronan has to strike an expression and hold it. A good chunk of the beginning of the film is an annoying inner monologue. However, this is unavoidable. That being said, after Melanie escapes her “imprisonment” and joins the last known humans, the plot moves along too quickly. This is especially shocking because the movie is over two hours long. Unlike most sci-fi action films, the heroines refuse to act violently so the plot was a little weak on actual action.
The general thread is supposed to be an impossible love triangle between a girl, two boys that seem interchangeable and a parasitic alien. However, the movie condenses so much of the book that as a viewer you cannot grasp the fact that a romance is supposed to be forming. I feel that there are more emotional “crises” than there is an actual story.
Even though the concept of the movie is completely different from Twilight, it is arguably worse because it lacks any actual passion if that is even possible.

Spring is here and with the weather changing, it’s difficult to transition your wardrobe from winter to spring. Unfortunately many of us don’t have a budget to redo our closet every three months to keep up with the forever changing trends. However, many of your winter wardrobe accessories can be worn into the spring season.
Jeans are an item that is found in the majority of college students’ closets. As the warmer weather approaches, but you’re not yet ready for shorts, what do you do? Take your jeans and roll up the bottoms. This is an easy transformation from pants to capris. There is no need to go out and buy brand new capris when you already have them in your closet! Colored denim is very trendy, so for those of you that purchased colored jeans, cuff them up and you’re right on target with spring trends.
After a season of wearing some of your jeans, do you ever feel like you’re over them? Like you just won’t wear them anymore (even if you were to roll the bottoms)? There is no reason to throw out a perfectly good pair of jeans. Sometimes you just need a big- ger change. You can say hello to a brand new pair of shorts. There are tons of do it yourself online tutorials explaining how to transform a pair of jeans into trendy shorts. Type into the YouTube search bar ‘how to cut jeans into shorts.’
Junior Broadcasting major, Maria Simone Otterlei, explained that she chooses to wear lighter colors such as white and cream. “I get rid of the all my heavy sweaters and jackets and put them in the back of my closet,” said Otterlei. Instead, she opts for jeans with a loose fitted blouse.
To instantly brighten up any spring look, a fresh coat of bright nail polish will do the trick. Spring is all about bright vibrant colors and patterns and that’s exactly what this season’s nail trend is all about. Nail polish can be purchased at any drug store in a multitude of shades and prices. Sally Han- sen’s nail line offers “Salon Effects” nail polish strips. They are strips of dried nail polish that are available in 32 different designs. There is no dry time and your nails look like artwork. Girl Flower #39 and Out of line #375 are perfect nail trends for spring.
Every woman has her favorite accessories, whether it be a statement necklace, bracelets, or earrings. Why not rock it into spring? All you need to do is shed some of those winter layers and pair your favorite pieces with your updated looks. You can still wear your scarves too. Get rid of the bulk sweater; throw on a tee and scarf and you’re ready for spring weather.
Remember, put away the heavy layers, keep the jeans and brighten up your look for spring with your favorite accessories and bright nail polish.
Now, for the men, the same rules apply. Ditch the heavy layers but keep the jeans. Men can transition into spring by lighting up their wardrobe colors as well. They can opt for whites, blues and even natural colors.
Jeans can be paired with any T-shirt and belt. Men you too can keep your scarfs, they look super trendy with a T-shirt as well. Instead of wearing your winter hats, now is the perfect time to bring out those baseball caps.
Junior Psychology major, Jason Kanyike, says that transitioning from winter to spring is simple for him. “I just stick with jeans and throw on a t-shirt,” said Kanyike. “Depending on the day I’ll either bring a hat, light jacket or a scarf with me,” added Kanyike.
Male or female there are many options to bring your winter wardrobe into your spring wardrobe.

Starting next semester, students who wish to live in Brookville Hall will be required to pay an additional five percent of their dorming fees because they’ll have the option of controlling the temperature.
The temperature-controlled accommodations were installed in Brookville Hall within the last ten years, according to Jennifer Fuoco, the director of Residence Life.
“In order to be fair to the residents without the personal heating and cooling option, there will now be a different rate for Brookville,” Fuoco said. “After a review of our accommodations and offerings, the University’s decision was to adjust the rate based on amenities offered,” Fuocco said.
The Office of Residence Life also researched rates at neighboring schools and found that other schools had done the same.
Additionally, there will be single-room options as a result of current residents’ requests. They will be offered in the South Residence Complex, Green. However, not anyone can get them. “They will be assigned based on class standing and priority will be given to those residents who are in good standing with the Office of Community Standards and Civic Engagement,” Fuoco said.
The cost will be $4500 per semester. The room rates are determined by different living plans. The lowest plan begins at $5,470 per semester, which includes either a suite style double or a traditional double and seven meals per week. This rate plan is the same in all residence halls.
The Pioneer learned that Kings Hall was going to be closed off next semester. The Office of Residence Life, according to Fuoco, determines which buildings will be open for room selection each year. “We do so based on oc- cupancy and residents’ preference of living style in recent years. It is too early to determine how many residents will live on campus for fall 2013. If Kings Hall is not open for the fall, there is the possibility that rooms will be renovated to remove carpet and update furniture,” she added.
Students must be registered for fall classes and submit a $300 deposit and a housing application by April 12 in order to choose a room and roommate.
Senior Biology major, Kristy Wong, said she thinks living off campus is the better option. “I think dorms are expensive as it is,” she added. “I think it’s unfair that they are charging people now for something they already had,” said senior Biology major, Hailey Brosnan.
Junior Biology major, Kelly Skinner, used to live in Brookville Hall. “It’s a bit ridiculous because we’ve been able to control the temperature for several years, and now all of a sudden they want to increase the price,” she said.
The Office of Residence Life also emphasizes that there will be no extensions or exceptions to participate in the room lottery if a student submits their forms after Friday by 4 p.m. The room selection will take place on April 19. Applications for single rooms are available at the Office of Residence Life in the lower level of Post Hall and are to be returned by Friday, April 12.

The end of the spring semester is very hectic. In addition to studying for final exams and applying for summer jobs and internships, students must begin to think about and choose the classes they want to take in the fall.
The best way to make sure you get the required courses for your major is to plan ahead and schedule an appointment with your academic advisor in advance. When it comes to picking courses, it is extremely important to check with the Academic Advising department, located in Kumble Hall on the second floor, to make sure that you take the right classes. No student wants to spend an extra year at school.
At LIU Post, many of the classes close quickly and there are a lot of time constraints.
“I’m trying to register for my classes, but the ones that I need to take are at conflicting times,” said Melissa Weisman, a sophomore Speech Pathology major. “Now I am unsure as to what I should do regarding my fall schedule.”
Certain courses are only offered during the fall, just as certain courses are only offered during the spring. It is important to know what courses you need to take to be able to graduate.
“I did not take enough of my required courses after I transferred from Laboratory Institute of Merchandising College, so I will be graduating next year as opposed to this year,” said Gabriella Ianiro, a junior Journalism major. “I also changed my major from Business to Journalism so I had a lot of credits to catch up on.”
Registration for the 2013 fall semester began on March 18. Student athletes and Honors Program members were allowed to begin registration a week before classes opened to the rest of the student body. When it comes to registering for classes, students have options to choose from. They can make an appointment with their academic advisor, which can take a long time as appointments in the office fill up quickly, log onto their myLIU accounts and enroll in courses online, email their academic advisor for a schedule or go to the advising office on Walk-In Wednesdays. On Walk-In Wednesdays, any student can see the advisor they want to without an appointment.
Students can find a list of their required courses by searching their major on the LIU Post website. All academic programs have a list of courses and the suggested academic year in which the course should be taken. Registering for courses online is extremely easy and time efficient. Simply just select the class, add it to the cart, and then hit enroll. The course schedule for the fall semester is online. Once students log into their myLIU accounts they can hit Class Search to view the list.
Before enrolling in courses, students must have no “blocks” on their academic record; meaning that all tuition bills have to be paid. Also, no student can have “holds”, or money owed for things such as parking tickets, and they must be enrolled for the upcoming academ- ic year.
“It is almost unfair that we cannot enroll in our classes until we pay the bill,” said Alyssa Yannuzzi, a sophomore Public Relations major. “This semester I didn’t get to take a lot of the classes I wanted because by the time I paid my tuition bill, the classes were closed.”This has always been the LIU Post policy, just as students cannot see their semester grades until the tuition bills are up to date.
Many students opt to take classes during one of the three summer sessions to get ahead or help keep up with credits.
“I am taking one summer course, because I studied abroad in Australia and missed a lot of my requirements that are only offered in the spring,” said Michelle Morey, a sophomore Journalism major. “I would rather spend a few weeks taking a hard class during the summer than taking too many credits in the fall.”
Registration for summer classes began on March 4. Not all courses are offered during the summer session, so be sure to check with the academic advisors about summer session offerings as well.
To contact the Office of Aca- demic Advising and Career Planning, located in Kumble Hall on the second floor, call (516) 299- 2746 or email ac@cwpost.liu.edu.

Have you ever gotten the feeling that you may not be the only person your guy has his eye on? Perhaps he isn’t being 100 percent faithful to you? But how could you really be sure about that short of pulling a Kim K. and hiring a private investigator? You can’t have him think that you may be on to him. Well ladies here are a few little red flags to keep in mind:
He never calls you by your full name—it’s always some pet name like beautiful or sweetie. Now, of course if you are in a long-term relationship this does not apply to you. I mean if it’s only been a few months. He also is most likely to never have called you by your real name. This could be because he does not want to accidentally call you one of the names of the three other girls he’s with. Females usually appreciate generic terms of endearment because it makes us think they’re committing. Don’t be fooled ladies; calling you “peanut” could just be a precaution.
Sketchy cell phone behavior—he plays with your phone all of the time because he loves some game app you have or he likes to mess around with your Facebook status. God forbid you try and use his phone and he immediately goes into ninja mode and holds it for dear life. Or he’ll give it to you after he does something to it first. Well, there you go. There’s a good chance he is deleting call history or text messages.
He loves to pull a Houdini—you’ll be texting back and forth one min- ute and the next it comes to a screeching halt. He then proceeds to fall off the grid for a day or two without so much as a quick text. Then he’ll try and turn it back around on you when he finally resurfaces. Whether he denies that you called or that he got your message or that he tried to call “like a hundred” times and your phone kept going into voicemail. Whatever his response is, it’s a load of crap.
I’ve done a fair amount of reading on the topic of signs you’re dating a player. These were the big three that were almost always written about. These are also typically the first signs that will stand out. I’m sure there are a ton of other things to look out for. Ladies, do fall into the trap of these types of boys. Unfortunately for us, these boys I’m talking about are college boys or guys from the ages of 18 to 30. Hold out for the good ones.

Activision and Terminal Reality developed a first-person shooter game based on the AMC television series “The Walking Dead” focusing on the two brothers, Daryl and Merle, before the zombie apocalypse starts and before the show begins.
Critics were apprehensive of the title because it looked like a major cash-in for the namesake alone. Terminal Reality has also produced some really poor games in the last few years. The most notable is Star Wars Kinect, one of the worst games for the X-Box Kinect, which was universally panned. I can still picture faces cringing in disgust at just the mention of its title. Many assumed this would be similarly disappointing and they were right, it is terrible.
The graphics are low quality in every way. Games from the early 2000’s look better then what we see here. There are some times that there is a nice shadow effect as if a zombie walks by, and when it is dark, there is some suspense. However, it looks rushed, as if no time was given to make the environments look interesting. The game is painfully linear as the player is forced to go certain ways and cannot create their own path through fallen fences and under cars. It is not immersive at all, which is boring. You are in this location, kill zombies, complete the main objective and an optional rinse and repeat.
To be fair, there are some decent jump scares but the game reuses this kind of scare tactic repeatedly so it becomes too predictable. Believe it or not, there are some good ideas in Survival Instinct. The player can find survivors that help scavenge for gas, ammunition and food. Side missions to find supplies and a new melee or firearm are available. Also, the game does use some elements from the show. For example, if you use the firearm, the player risks alerting too many sur- rounding zombies and then has to escape a swarm of them. There is a sneaking mechanic to kill zombies in an assassin-like attack. However, the combat is still too easy and too repetitive.
This lazy cash-in retails at $49.99. It was meant to be a prequel to the TV series yet the ending in no way tells players anything new or makes it worth completing. The ending was basically “we survived, let’s go.” Even the overall story is sluggish. There is nothing interesting here. It completely misses the point of the game, which was to make a prequel first-person shooter game.
Besides seeing characters Daryl and Merle, the rest of the characters are forgettable and the majority of the voice acting is inadequate. It is clear that the developers had some promising intentions to make this game stand out, but it was just pushed out the door to cash in on the success of the television show. The game is boring, tedious, buggy and the graphics are a mess. I give it a 2/10. Do not even bother.

It is time to be spooked with the much anticipated Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon, which was released for the Nintendo 3DS on March 24. Dark Moon is a sequel to the 2001 GameCube version of Luigi’s first game, Luigi’s Mansion, which became one of the biggest cult hits in the gaming world. Its sales were minimal, and the reviews were lackluster, but true fans begged for a sequel. It took Nintendo 12 years to give them the game they wanted. Ear- lier this year, Nintendo’s head designer and producer, Shigeru Miyamoto, announced on the company’s website that this was the Year of Luigi and Dark Moon surely delivers as one of the 3DS’ strongest titles to date.
The game opens with Luigi sleeping in his house. He is abruptly woken up by his television. What are the odds that Professor E. Gadd, the maniacal scientist to whom Luigi called for help in the first game, needs his help in the sequel? Like the scene in Poltergeist, Luigi is sucked into the television and transported to Gadd’s lab. The sidekick instructs Luigi to search for pieces of the “Dark Moon,” a mysterious jewel that allows ghosts to be emotionally controlled for the benefit of mankind. With ghosts now floating rampant in the town of Evershade Valley, it is up to Luigi to save each mansion by “cleansing” the place with his trusty flashlight and Poltergust 5000, a nifty vacuum cleaner that traps ghouls and spirits so they can no longer wreak havoc.
Within the first few minutes of the game, I could see that the controls use every button on the 3DS, so nothing goes to waste. What is convenient about the camera view is that the player can control Luigi’s perspective without the usage of a second joystick. Players simply move the 3DS around and check your peripherals in an instant.
Another smart move on the developer’s part was the use of the second screen. It acts as a map letting the player know which rooms are locked or open and where to go to reach the next objective. A quick look at the bottom screen allows the player to have a nearly full top half experience of the system without any distractions.
Another minor detail I will note is the modeling in the 3DS games. The programmers have yet to find a way to smooth out rounded edges. Nonetheless, it is a colorful game. Even the ghosts are not a typical white or gray hue. They vary in color and they are given personalities. For example, red ghosts are big and abrasive while green ghosts are tiny and mischievous.
A great introduction to the game is the new multiplayer mode. Players can go online locally (between linked systems) or worldwide to compete in a variety of mini-missions like timed ghost-hunting or a survival mode missions where spirits are on a non-stop rampage.
Fans of previous Mario games or the first Luigi’s Man- ision will not be disappointed by this game. In fact, this game is completely revamped. While the first Mansion paved the way for Dark Moon, this new adventure provides fans with a new defini- tion of the word “hero.” Taking into consideration the minor graphic setbacks, this game has received a lot of positive feed- back. Luigi is starting to look like a major contender for future Nintendo games.

The LIU Post baseball team faced Mercy College four times in a three-day span from April 5-7 and managed to win the first two games, but dropped the final two of the set.
The Pioneers (11-13) won the first game of the set on the road in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. by a final score of 2-1.
The following day, the Pioneers headed home for a double- header against the Mavericks (6-21-1). In the first contest of the double-dip, the Pioneers shut out Mercy with a 7-0 win led behind effort of redshirt sophomore pitcher Mike Eckerle. He tossed a complete game, striking out 13 batters in seven innings of work. For the season, Eckerle has been dominant as he owns a 0.79 ERA in 34 innings of work. The bats for the Pioneers were sizzling as senior shortstop Kevin Chenicek went 2-4 with 3 RBI’s and junior centerfielder Rich Maccarone hit a
two-run triple. Although the Pioneers had their way in the first two games, they were unable to duplicate the end result in the final two games. In the second half of the double- header, a first inning run by the Mavericks was the only score of the entire contest. It was a pitcher’s duel as Mercy’s freshman pitcher Christian Hock threw seven scoreless frames, allowing only six hits and no walks. Pioneers’ freshman pitcher Chris Anderson gave up one run while scattering five hits.
For the third consecutive day, the two teams went head to head. The Pioneers went back to Dobbs Ferry and once again were unable to find any offense as they lost 2-1. The Pioneers got off to a good start early on as senior catcher Anthony Corona hit a solo homerun in the second inning, giving the LIU Post a 1-0 advantage. However, that proved to be the only run the Pio- neers scored.
The Pioneers have an 11-13 overall record this season and are 4-4 in East Coast Conference play. They next are in action on Friday, April 12 when they square off against Molloy College (14-19) on the road with first pitch scheduled for 3:30 p.m. The Pioneers have the same four-game set against Molloy as they did against Mercy with a game on the road, a double- header at home, and then another game at Molloy to conclude the series in a span of three days.

No Time to Explain, a two-dimensional puzzle platformer released on January 25, is a game that caught my attention on the greenlight section of Steam. Prior to this, I remember seeing a smaller free version on Newgrounds, a website dedicated to indie game developers, animators, musicians and artists. The development team, tinybuild Games, raised enough money and support to create the full version of No Time to Explain.
The game is simplistic but a lot of fun and somewhat unexpected. To start the game, the player’s character is at home and its future self crash- es through the window saying, “I’m you from the future. There is no time to explain.” Then, a giant mutated crab monster captures the future self. He drops his laser gun, which the player uses to catapult themselves over large distances and destroy blocks.
I stared at my computer screen in awe and laughing at how brilliant and crazy No Time to Explain is. I really enjoyed this game. Even though it is short, it is fun. There are silly collectables, such as hats the character can wear and collect. I do wish it was a bit longer and the controls can be a bit awkward at times, but that is part of the chal- lenge. The graphics are very simple, clearly staying true to the online flash game it was originally.
Overall, the game is funny, easy to play, a decent challenge and relatively inexpensive. It is only $10 on Steam. Flashing back and forth in time with no explanation is an interesting and cool concept. Try the game and see for yourself. I give No Time to Explain a 7/10.
