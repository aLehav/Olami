On Wednesday, January 30, the Xi Chapter of Hermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha Incorpora­da hosted an event in the Hill­wood TV room about the misuse of drugs, including over-the-counter and prescription drugs. It was the first time it held this kind of event.
During the lecture, the club stated that using legal drugs in an improper way could be just as dangerous as using illegal ones. In fact, it is illegal to share or sell your own pre­scription drugs to anyone. The prescription you get from a doc­tor is only valid for you, since it is specific to your age, weight, height and even your ethnicity.
The consequences of abus­ing drugs include hospitaliza­tion and even death. One type of drug abuse includes taking a roommate’s prescription for At­tention Deficit Disorder because they think that they need it to study or taking “Molly,” the pur­est form of ecstasy because they want to party.
Michelle Seke, a junior So­ciology major, who is a member of the sorority, thinks it is im­portant to bring these questions up because it might save some­one’s life. “Some teenagers don’t feel comfortable sharing their problems, so if we had a club or counseling of some sort avail­able to these teens, we could possibly help many,” she said.
Sylvia Diable, a senior Speech Language Pathology ma­jor who is also a member of the sorority, convinced the group to hold this event after telling them what she saw at her workplace. Diable works at a pharmacy and encounters a large amount of teenagers who come in for drugs and try to convince her to sell drugs to them.
Diable said, “The most popular story we hear is that the person they are buying the pills for was in a car accident,” she continued, “drug abuse is so common at our age because we all deal with different levels of stress and have numerous responsibilities, so our genera­tion thinks drugs are the easiest relievers for all our problems.”
A common way to over­dose on over the counter drugs is to take something with dex­tromethorphan in it, generally found in cough and cold medica­tions. This dangerous and pos­sibly deadly practice is only increasing in numbers of users, stated the sorority. The most common side effects include blurred vision, high blood pres­sure, numbness, unconscious­ness, seizures, brain damage and death. Some teenagers will do anything to get high, going so far as to use hand sanitizers and common household spices like nutmeg.
Another common misuse of drugs is accidental. Split­ting your pill in half, taking the wrong kind of medication or taking too much of some­thing because you think it is the proper dosage are all ways you might abuse drugs without even knowing it.
During the lecture, Seke shared a personal story. “In high school during my junior year, I would constantly get headaches and I would take two Tylenols a day for two weeks straight to relieve it. It was making me sicker so I went to the doctor and he told me to stop because it could damage my liver and I could die.” Seke, just like many others, was not aware of the dangers and did not even know it was possible.
Diable said that it is ex­tremely important to make sure that you always are aware of what you take. It is also impor­tant to always take the exact dosage your doctor prescribes to you. Both under medicating and overmedicating can be danger­ous. “If you are under medicat­ing, it will take a lot longer to feel better. If you are overmedi­cating, you can become immune to the drug or you might over­dose,” she stated.
It is important to know that there is help. There are 24-hour hotlines for prescribed drug abuse. Students can also contact Student Health and Counseling on campus at its 24-hour emer­gency number 516-299-2222.
It is also important to involve parents and friends. If your friend has a problem, you should talk to their parents and let your friend know the dangers of abusing drugs. If you are in a situation where you are tak­ing drugs in the wrong way, be aware of the dangers and seek help for your problem.
Seke thinks that this event has given her sorority leeway to do more in the prevention of drug abuse, “whether it be doing a program every semester or having an awareness week with fundraisers to help raise money towards those organizations dealing with teens and drugs,” she said.

Pratt After Dark, the indoor carnival held at Post each February in the Pratt Recre­ation Center, featured various free activities for students. Recreational Sports, Residence Life, Student Life & Leadership Development, Dining services and the Division of Student Success sponsored this event. The festivities kicked off on February 1 at 10 p.m.
Activities and features included, eat­ing contests, prizes, and music by WCWP, a blow-up Twister board. There was enter­tainment lined up the entire night. A small ice rink was installed in the center of the gym for those daring enough to partake. Complimentary food and beverages were available for attendees. A variety of options were offered including nachos, pretzels, ice cream sandwiches and an assortment of fountain drinks. There was also a smoothie stand and a popcorn stand.
Students of all ages mingled and got to know one another while others brought friends from elsewhere as guests. “It’s my first time being here and I think it’s a great pro­gram. It was so much fun. I met a bunch of new people, and the free food is never a bad thing,” said freshman Health Management major Sarah Hecht.
Hecht recently transferred from the University of Towson in Maryland, and ap­preciated the opportunity to meet people from the school. “I had heard this event was popular and a lot of people would show so I figured why not. It was worth it too because I got to meet girls from sororities I’m inter­ested in joining.”
Just like Hecht, many other students in attendance turned up in order to meet and interact with other students. Freshman Me­gan Draghi, a transfer student from Mount Saint Mary College in Newburgh, N.Y., said that she heard about the event from a friend, who told her it would be a great way to network and meet other students. “It definitely is [a great way to meet people]. I ran into people from my classes that I’ve never spoken to before and even got to meet the people they were with,” said Draghi.
The event went on until 2:00 a.m., giv­ing students time to exchange numbers and chat. By the end of the night, some people were worn out. “We were all so tired,” Hecht said, “but it was worth it! If you didn’t get to go to Pratt After Dark this year, definitely go next year! It was a great time.”

The status and money that professional athletes seize by do­ing what they love is an inspira­tion to many students. However, sometimes morals are tested in the journey to get there. An athlete can train all their life and still not become the strongest or fastest. So, what is the difference between a world-class athlete and one who is not? One might hope that it is the age-old concoction of blood, sweat and tears – want­ing it more than anyone else and training every day to get there. Lately, however, other theories have proven to be true.
Performance enhancing drugs, or ergogenic drugs, are being used by some athletes to enhance their physical abilities. According to the Journal of the American Academy of Pediat­rics, some ergogenic drugs that are commonly used by student athletes include anabolic-andro­genic steroids, growth hormone and creatine. With professional athletes such as Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees and seven-time-consecutive-winner of the Tour de France, Lance Arm­strong, both being involved with inquiries about PED usage, the question of how far one will go to succeed comes up.
LIU Post men’s basketball coach, Christopher Casey agrees that professional athletes can in­fluence student athletes. “I’m not saying it’s right because it defi­nitely isn’t but you can give a tiny bit of credence to the argument,” he says. Athletes have big egos and a competitive nature, according to Casey, and are always thinking about moving up. If players are doing it and moving up, others might start to think “How can I get away with it too?”
LIU Post is a Division II school and the home of many dedicated athletes. To keep ath­letes on the right path during their personal athletic journey, Post imposes many drug testing regula­tions. Drug tests at Post, whether given by the Athletic Department or the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) include tests for both recreational and perfor­mance enhancing drugs. Due to their expense (a regular drug test goes for about $25.00 and a PED test goes for about $150.00 a pop), PEDs are generally only tested for at the institutional level if a trainer or coach has a “suspicion”, howev­er, the NCAA tests for everything, every time.
According to head ath­letic trainer Shawn McNamara, “Our regulations stipulate that when a student athlete comes in and will play on one of our sports teams, the student and their parents have to sign a consent form that they can be drug tested at any time.” How­ever, unless a coach or trainer is suspicious of a particular player using illegal substances, the athletes who are tested are chosen at random by an outside drug testing company. About 15 athletes are selected every two weeks and tested for an array of about 8-10 of the most highly used recreational drugs. “We are more concerned about a person driving drunk, harming them­selves or others, and represent­ing the college well, than the enhancement,” said McNamara. “The NCAA is worried about everything else in the conglom­erate.”
Once a year, the NCAA also randomly chooses athletes to drug test. They test for recreational and performance enhancing drugs. Unlike Post, which in the case of a first positive drug test takes steps to educate the player and help them understand the consequenc­es of drug use, the NCAA suspends the athlete for an entire season af­ter the first positive. If an athlete wants to challenge a test, they can do so at their own expense. “No one has ever denied that they have done something though,” said McNamara.
Eirik Bjorno, senior Jour­nalism student and captain of the men’s soccer team, said that it doesn’t matter if you take PEDs when you are working out at the gym or in the Olympics; the moment you take away fair competition from the sport there is no point in competing. For Bjorno, growing up and watching Armstrong race in cycling was remarkable and finding out that it was all a lie, was devastating. “Athletes are – and should be – held to higher standards,” says Casey, “They represent not only themselves but their institution as well.”
“As a coach it is not only my job to coach them [athletes] in the sport but to coach them off the court too, so they are good qual­ity people in everyday life,” added Casey. It is a common practice for Post coaches to speak to their players about the penalties that come with a positive drug test. “We want to keep the integrity of the Athletic Department and we want to have athletes who are drug free and trying to get better every day, without drugs,” said Athletic Director and head football coach, Bryan Collins.
Unfortunately though, drug testing is random among the athletes and there are some play­ers who have gone all four years without being tested once. “I have personally heard athletes talk­ing about how easy it is to get it [PEDs]. You can get both anabol­ic steroids and drugs like EPO on the internet,” said Bjorno.
Celebrities often influence our style, attitudes, wants and needs. If you are looking to reach a certain level of success it surely is common to look up to some­one who has already reached it. Junior broadcasting major Vaughn Allen, a member of the Post men’s basketball team, also agrees that professional athletes influence student athletes. “If you see a professional taking drugs to better themselves, you might do the same.” It’s not just athletics, Casey reminds us, for example, it can be seen in the financial world too, “Someone will step out of line and benefit from it and oth­ers will think, ‘What can I do to get there too?’”
The bottom line is that everyone looks up to someone. Whether you are a world-class athlete or the captain of your col­lege soccer team, you are a leader that others view as a role model. Lance Armstrong’s athletic career is seen as a sham to many these days, but who knows what kind of influence his unethical behavior will have on other athletes. “Pro­fessional athletes need to under­stand the responsibility they have over the younger athletes and their fans,” said Bjorno, “Their actions mirror down in younger ages and the culture is formed by their actions.”

With Manhattan less than an hour away, a weekend excur­sion to an indoor attraction is a welcoming distraction from too much studying. The American Museum of Natural History offers a journey from the dinosaur age to the future in space, at a dis­count for students.
Just left of Central Park stands a large, brown building with a pompous entrance and high ceilinged lobby where a couple of well-preserved dinosaur skeletons welcome visitors to the museum. Upon entering, there is that feeling of recognition, as if one had seen this before.
And many of us have, but only on the movie screen. In 2006, ‘Night at the Museum’ opened in movie theatres across the globe, with actor Ben Stiller playing a night shift guard, who experienced how an ancient curse brought animals and exhibits on display to life after closing hours. The American Museum of Natu­ral History, or the AMNH, is the location where the main parts of the movie were shot, and many of the objects that came to life in the film are on display here. How­ever, during a daytime visit, they stand completely still.
This does not mean that the museum lacks action though. There is still plenty to see, expe­rience and interact with. Even photographing is allowed. On four really large floors, stands everything from stuffed mam­mals, reptile fossils and dinosaur skeletons, along with a wide range of ancient items and ar­tifacts from numerous cultures and civilizations. There is also the ‘Guggenheim Hall of Minerals,’ the ‘Hall of Biodiversity’ and the ‘Millstein Hall of Ocean Life.’ In other words, there is a lot to see.
Starting at $5 extra added to the entrance fee, there is also the opportunity of watching one or more special exhibitions. Right now, there is an IMAX-movie, a space show, and a global food exhibition on display.
The LeFrak IMAX-theatre is now presenting ‘The Journey of the Butterflies,’ – a movie where the plot might be perceived a lit­tle slow, but with extraordinary color photography, and a unique story of how one man, a great butterfly enthusiast, devoted his life to mapping the flying route of a particular type of butterfly.
Playing in the Rose Center for Earth and Space, (a large planetarium attached to the mu­seum), the ‘Journey to the Stars’ composes a telescopically filmed space show, narrated by actress Whoopi Goldberg, where viewers travel from past to future while learning about the birth and death of stars.
Then, there is ‘Our Global Kitchen: Food, Nature, Culture.’ The exhibition presents global food markets, while teaching essential parts of some of the global challenges related to the topic. There is also the opportu­nity of tasting food from multiple corners of the world.
For those hungry for more, there are food courts and ca­fés inside the museum offering simple dishes like sandwiches, salads, and hot dogs, along with snacks. Just make sure to finish your meal before walking back inside since guards do not en­courage a mess of food residue. If looking to buy a souvenir, there are plenty of gift shops, selling miniature, and some­times cotton stuffed, versions of almost everything to be seen in the museum.
Lastly, the AMNH offers a variety of tours. The ‘Dino Tour,’ the ‘Highlights Tour’ and the ‘Earth and Space Tour’ are just a few of them. And then of course, there is the ‘Night at the Museum Tour,’ which although offered during daytime, still introduces visitors to the real exhibits behind the movie char­acters. Normally, no unexpected movements or unplanned activ­ity from the animals or objects frightens the guests, but just in case, be careful not to spell out a curse. We don’t know what happens during night at this museum.
Information:
Address and Directions: 79th Street at Central Park West, 10024, NY. Take Subway train B (on weekdays), and Subway C, get off at 81st Street. Parking is available under the museum starting at $24 for one hour.
Prices: Students with ID pay a discount entrance of $19. Adults pay $25, Children (2-12) pay $14.50. Special exhibitions can be purchased for an addi­tional $5 per show.
Opening Hours: Daily from 10am to 5.45pm.

When walking around cam­pus, it’s hard to recognize that each individual student has their own story; they aren’t merely background characters to your life, but they exist on their own account. People’s outer shells often deceive. It’s not always easy for students to put on a happy face; concentrating in class and managing work can become formidable, and pose a threat to ones GPA.
LIU Post strives to create a comfortable environment for all types of students. From the avail­able and confidential counseling, to the Learning Support Center, students are presented with an assortment of options to help pinpoint and address their prob­lem areas. The Office of Disability Support Services (DSS), focuses on providing students with equal opportunities and various accom­modations for special needs and disabilities.
These accommodations are provided by individual academic departments, according to the Student Life Services tab on the LIU Post website, which states, “…accommodations include but are not limited to extended time for tests, note takers, use of a tape recorder in class, reading exam questions to a student, a scribe to record a student’s answers to test questions, and the use of a com­puter for an essay exam.”
The DSS has available on campus job opportunities as note takers for any student, work-study or not, who is will­ing to take legible, constructive notes for disabled students, and get paid $7.25 an hour for it. Not only is the payment itself an incentive, but the cause is one as well. Marie Fatscher, Assistant Director at the Learning Support Center, expressed the importance of note taking as a supplement for certain students. She stated that the note taking option has been in place since the mid-1980s. The notes, after being submitted via e-mail to the Learning Sup­port Center, are published on a Blackboard tab for easy access. However, according to Fatscher, not all students with disabilities require note takers. The office of Disability Support Services, located in the Learning Support Center, must approve the accom­modation. The documentation is further reviewed by professional staff, which later interviews the student, and provides them with completed Accommodations Forms (describing the nature of their learning disability) for pre­sentation to their professors.
Note takers are employed by The Learning Support Center at the start of each semester. The responsibilities of a note taker are straight forward: be diligent in making it to every class, be obser­vant and focus on what the profes­sor is saying, and take notes in a coherent format. Not only are you accountable for writing down what the professor writes down on the board, but also things that they say that are significant. As a note taker myself, it makes my class hours go by faster, and I am more attentive. I am not only paying at­tention for my own apprehension, but I am also motivated to follow along so that I could comply with my position as a note taker, and provide helpful notes that stu­dents could actually learn from.
When note takers are needed in a class, all applicable students are contacted. Students interested in positions as note takers or an­other learning support option (to be a reader and/or amanuensis, which is someone who translates the students’ words onto paper) can contact or visit the Learning Support Center. The office is lo­cated in Post Hall, and the phone number is 516-299-3057.

After defeating Dowl­ing College on Post Pride Night, the LIU Post women’s basketball team registered its second consecutive win af­ter grinding out a victory on Saturday, February 2, against the Molloy College Lions. Although the game got off to a slow, and rather ugly pace, the Lady Pioneers found a way to win by a score of 54-43.
Neither team could find an offensive rhythm during the majority of the first half. The first points of the con­test came after nearly four minutes of action off a three-pointer by Molloy’s senior guard Christina Marra. After a couple of made baskets, the score was deadlocked at 5-5 until 9:15 mark in the first half. However, the Lady Pio­neers would eventually find some continuity and go into halftime leading 26-17.
Unfortunately for the Li­ons, nine points would be the closest the team would get for the rest of the game. The Lady Pioneers stretched its lead to as many as 16 points during the final 20 minutes of play, and the Lions did not have enough firepower to make a bid for a comeback.
For the season, the Lady Pioneers average nearly 67 points per game. However during the last two games against Dowling and Molloy, head coach Deirdre Moore has needed some energy off her bench. On Saturday, junior guard Jalicia Connell provid­ed a spark as she made three shots from beyond the arc in her 14 minutes of play.
Junior forward Shayna Gatling and junior guard Alexis Peters tied the team-high in scoring as each dropped 10 points. Gatling added eight rebounds, and Peters secured seven re­bounds as well as four assists.
A positive statistic to take away from this game is the rebounding differential in favor of the Lady Pioneers. The green and gold had 45 total rebounds compared to the Lions’ total of 36 boards. In addition, the Lady Pioneers crashed the offensive glass hard as the team edged out the Lions 16-14. Keep in mind that the Lady Pioneers were the better rebounding team despite Molloy’s senior for­ward Ikema Ross grabbing 21 rebounds by herself.
One game removed from committing only 11 turnovers against Dowling, the Lady Pioneers went back to its old habit of turning the ball over. The Lady Pioneers reached the average for the season in the win against Molloy as the team had 22 turnovers.
The Lady Pioneers cur­rently have a 14-5 overall record, and sit in fourth place in the East Coast Conference with a 7-4 conference record. The Lady Pioneers’ next game is tonight on the road against Queens College (7-11). Tipoff is scheduled for 5:00 p.m., but you can catch all your LIU Post Pioneers basketball cov­erage on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org. Pregame is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. The last time these two teams faced each other was back on January 5, when the Lady Pioneers cruised to an 82-69 victory at the Pratt Recreation Center.

The 2013 Super Bowl between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers had just about all you could ask for: a future Hall-of-Famer playing in his final game, the opposing coaches were brothers, a kick return for a touch­down, clutch throws on offense and big hits on defense, a Beyoncé halftime show, and even a power outage to add further drama.
It is estimated that over 108 million viewers tuned into the Super Bowl this year, which is actually a slight decline compared to last year’s 111.3 million viewers. In the game, despite nearly blowing a 21-6 halftime lead, the Ravens edged out the Niners by a final score of 34-31 to win their second Super Bowl in franchise history. Joe Flacco, the fifth-year quarterback for the Ravens, won MVP honors for his outstanding play. He completed 22 of his 33 passes for 287 yards. He also threw three touchdowns without throwing an interception.
Niners’ quarterback Colin Kae­pernick played well, but he needed to duplicate his effort from his two previ­ous games against the Falcons or Pack­ers to come away with a win against the Ravens and their suffocating defense. Kaepernick was 16-28 for 302 yards with one touchdown and one intercep­tion.
On the first drive of the game, the Niners were immediately stopped by the Ravens, and Baltimore began the contest with great field position. On the Ravens’ first trip down the field, Flacco connected with Anquan Boldin for a 13 yard score to make it 7-0. Flacco would continue to make big-time, elite throws throughout the half. Midway through the second quarter, Flacco found tight end Dennis Pitta for a one yard touch­down. Soon after, Flacco aired it out to Jacoby Jones for a 56 yard score. And just like that, the Ravens went into the Beyoncé-centered halftime leading 21-6.
From what could gather through social media, Beyoncé (and Destiny’s Child) absolutely killed it during halftime, and the show was a sure improvement from previous years’ entertainment choices such as Prince, The Who, and Madonna among oth­ers. However in a plot twist, after the sizzling performance by Beyoncé, the power at the Mercedes-Benz Super­dome went out. There’s obviously no handbook to revert to about what to do when the lights go out in one of the most televised events of the year — during the game! Some viewers at home may have flipped the channel during the 34 minute blackout, but others were captivated by the oddity of the play stoppage.
Once play finally resumed, the Ravens quickly lost all momentum. The Niners’ offense awoke and found a rhythm. Early in the fourth quarter, it was a one possession game as the Ravens led 31-23. With just under 10 minutes left to play in the contest, Kae­pernick scampered his way to a 15 yard touchdown to pull within two points of the Ravens. On the two point conver­sion try, there was an incomplete pass, leaving the Ravens with only a 31-29 advantage.
Down 34-29 with a couple minutes left in their season, the Niners had one last chance to win the game. However, Ray Lewis and the Ravens stepped up on a goal-to-go stand to wrap up the Super Bowl win. Lewis, the 17-year veteran who has spent his whole career with the Ra­vens, has already declared that this was his final season, so he will leave the game of football as a champion.
John Harbaugh (50 years old) defeated Jim Harbaugh (49) in what was coined the “Harbowl.” The two are brothers, and fought like brothers do. Neither gave up. But in the end, the older brother always finds a way to win, right?

On Saturday, February 2 the LIU Post Pioneers lost a heartbreaker in overtime to the Molloy College Lions by a final score of 75-73.
It was the second time in less than a week that the Pio­neers took the game to the wire. On Wednesday, January 30, they came back and defeated the Dowling College Golden Lions 70-69 after trailing by as many as 13 points in the contest.
The Pioneers struggled in the first half against the Golden Lions, shooting 39 percent from the field and just 14 percent from three-point range. Going into halftime the Golden Lions led 40-30.
The second half started off with a three-pointer by Dowl­ing’s senior guard Josh Malone, but after that the Pioneers began chipping away at the Golden Li­ons lead. Junior forward Vaughn Allen put up five points to cut the Dowling lead to eight. By the 14:34 mark, Allen had gotten the Pioneers within two points.
With 10:25 left in the game, sophomore forward Tyuan Williams shortened Dowling’s lead and 24 seconds later senior guard Jonathan Kohler finally propelled the Pioneers ahead with a 54-53 advantage.
The Golden Lions would give the Pioneers a scare when Dowling’s junior guard Leon Taylor hit a basket to make it a one point lead for Dowling with 21 seconds left in the game. However, the Pioneers would come up clutch during the final seconds and escape with a win.
The Pioneers finished the game shooting 42 percent from the field and 27 percent from behind the arc. Allen finished the game with 17 points, while Kohler finished with 15 of his own.
However, the Pioneers wouldn’t get as lucky on Satur­day against the Lions of Molloy.
Despite chipping away at the Lions lead and eventually taking it late in the second half, Molloy kept the game close. With just 15 seconds left in the game, senior guard Tobin Carberry gave the Pioneers a 66-63 lead after two made free throws. On the ensuing Molloy possession, the Lions made the most of it as freshman forward Kevin drained a three-pointer to tie the game at 66. LIU had one last shot at a win, but on the final pos­session of regulation the Pioneers came up empty, and the game went to overtime.
In the overtime period, the Pioneers could not get it togeth­er as Molloy quickly jumped ahead. LIU kept it close, but ulti­mately fell 75-73.
Carberry led the Pioneers with 21 points and also secured nine rebounds. Kohler added 12 points, along with two assists and one block.
The loss moves the Pioneers to 13-6 on the season and 8-3 in East Coast Conference play. The Pioneers next game is today, at Queens Col­lege scheduled for 7:30. Pregame will follow the women’s game set for approximately 7:00. All your Pioneers basketball coverage can be found on 88.1 FM or WCWP.org.

The search is finally over. On January 25 Disney confirmed J.J. Abrams to helm the anticipated Star Wars VII as director. This decision has raked in a steady flow of ap­proval and disproval from fans of the mas­sively popular franchise. The film is slated for a 2015 release. While there will always be a dark side to such an important deciding point, here are three reasons why we can perhaps breath a little easier for that galaxy, far, far away.
Reason #1: A Geek’s Experience 
Abrams is known for his contributions to the science-fiction genre ranging from his collaborative Super 8 with Steven Spielberg in 2011 to the successful reboot of the Star Trek franchise in 2009. While fans of Star Trek and Star Wars have butted heads in the past, the critical and fiscal success of the recent Trek reboot cannot be denied. Not only has Abrams tackled large franchises with success, he has handled epic sagas on television. Most recently, Abrams has continued his sci-fi em­pire with popular shows like Revolution, Lost, Fringe, and Person of Interest.
Reason #2: Micheal Arndt is a Cham­pion Screenwriter
In 2006, Michael Arndt’s script for Little Miss Sunshine (his first produced feature) won Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars among other accolades. The popularity of his work has only increased since with the mas­sive hit that was Toy Story 3, which was an exceptionally challenging and weighty task as the end to a beloved series. Arndt’s success with that PIXAR production affirms his skill for creating a well rounded story even if it has been a long awaited and anticipated finale. Thus, the new Star Wars film is (hopefully) in safe hands.
Reason #3 A Rule Book 
The first Star Wars film came out in 1977. Five more feature-length live action films, hundreds of books, comics, and tele­vision spin-offs later and there is plenty of material for Abrams and crew to sort out. For example, over-the-top characters like Jar-Jar Binks have been panned by Star Wars fans for years as selling out for the younger gener­ations. There has been similar disdain about the general tone, look (heavy usage of CGI), and flow of the newest Star Wars trilogy started in 1999 (prequels to the initial four, five, and six). If the tons and tons of feedback gathered over more than thirty years doesn’t have the slightest impact on the upcoming film, something is terribly wrong.

On January 24 and 25, laughter filled the Hillwood Theater as actors Dan Clarkson and Jeff Turner acted out the seven Harry Potter novels in 70 min­utes. That’s right, all seven J.K. Rowling novels explained in the length of just one Harry Potter movie. Potted Potter even included a game of Quidditch, a favorite sport of Harry Potter fans.
The audience was able to participate in the game being split into the Gryf­findor and Slytherin teams. They passed a beach ball around hoping to get it into the goal on each wall of the theater. One audience member from each team was then selected to go up on stage and be their team’s seeker, the person who must catch the golden snitch to win the game. Turner dressed up in a ridiculously fun­ny, yellow costume as the golden snitch.
Throughout the show Clarkson and Turner brought the beloved characters Harry Potter and Ron Weasley and the not so great Lord Voldemort and Draco Malfoy to life. The men also gave a co­medic kick that made the audience think kindly toward the name Voldemort even if “he shall not be named.” Their cos­tume choices of wigs, hats, and robes had responses of laughter- especially Hagrid’s unruly hair. The best part of their story­telling was the props. Whether it was the canvas of a tropic beach scene labeled the Forbidden Forest or an adorable stuffed animal snake attached to a leash repre­senting Voldemort’s deadly snake Nagini, the modest looking props helped add onto the amusement of the viewers.
Potted Potter was a perfect balance of two completely different people com­ing together to make an outrageously funny show. Turner’s dedication toward accurately narrating the stories and play­ing Harry Potter made the show fun and easy enough to follow if one had never read the Harry Potter books before. Clarkson’s zest for disorganization such as spending most of the budget money on a dragon hand puppet makes him adored by the audience for his innocence as he creates excitement and laughter throughout.
The show received a well-deserved standing ovation from the audience. Sarah Hecht, a freshman social work major, proclaimed “I loved it. It was hi­larious. It was a good length of time and it was an amazingly funny way to explain the seven amazing books.” It was a de­light for the audience, Harry Potter fans and non-Harry Potter fans alike, making this show perfectly entertaining for just about anyone.

Django Unchained, the brainchild of ac­claimed Hollywood director Quentin Taranti­no (Kill Bill), opened in theaters on December 25. When I say the word open, I mean that Django Unchained busted through the walls of theaters across America. The film implores the talents of some well-known actors includ­ing Jamie Foxx (Ray), Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic), Kerry Washington (The Last King of Scotland), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fic­tion) just to name a few.
Besides boasting an all-star cast, the film tells the story of a former slave turned bounty hunter named Django, played by Foxx, who goes on a quest to rescue his wife from Missis­sippi’s largest plantation, Candyland. Django and his wife, Broomhilda, played by Washing­ton, originally lived on the same plantation. The two were sold separately by their former owner as punishment for trying to runaway. And I am stopping there.
If I gave you a summary of the whole movie, it would turn into a lengthy essay. Why you ask? Because the movie is 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Why would you want to sit through such a long film? Because it’s awesome! It’s a lot longer than most movies that last for 90 minutes, but it’s worth it. I’ve noticed a trend in recently released films. In an attempt to shorten the runtime, producers and directors have compromised the quality of the stories. Audiences across the country are leaving theaters dissatisfied. I guess that Hollywood doesn’t think that we’ll invest our time in movies that are actually worth watch­ing but Tarantino avoids falling into that trap.
Although the film is built around the story of Django, it manages to capture the spirit of one of the most important times in our nation’s history. Tarantino is known for his exaggerated style of storytelling so when I first saw the preview for the Django, I was concerned that Tarantino’s style would make a mockery of slavery. Being an African-Amer­ican, I wasn’t too keen on the idea of Holly­wood using ancestors’ hardships as the butt of its jokes. Boy did he prove me wrong. Tar­antino’s over-exaggeration actually helps to highlight the graphic nature of slavery. There were times in the film when I could not even bare to look at the screen. Then I thought to myself, “The images that I’m seeing right now probably don’t even come close to what actu­ally happened during that time period.”
The actors and production team came together to offer an experience to viewers that is second to none. 3D has become such a big fuss over the last few years but Django Unchained does not need effects to make you feel like you are right there with the characters as they try to overcome a world of hatred. The film has been nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. I give it 4 out of 4 stars. Go see it! Just make sure you go to the bathroom first.

DLC Quest is an indie side-scrolling/platformer game developed by Going Loud Stu­dios. It is a satire game based on DLC where you have to purchase DLC by collecting gold coins to do anything like have music and weapons.
Players follow a nameless hero whose girlfriend has been kidnapped by a nameless vil­lain. He then proceeds to rescue her. There is a DLC zombie pack and the description literally says, “This doesn’t really fit but our marketing department says every game needs zombies.” This is clearly spoofing on the out of place DLC zombie content that for some reason developers sell to make more money on their games. The game is full of humor and spoofs and I found myself laughing at some of the jokes.
However a BIG problem with the game is how unbeliev­able short it is: less than an hour! Now, don’t get me wrong it’s only $1 on X-Box live but how can a game be that short? Overall, while it is fun but because it is just a dollar, you don’t have the ability to replay the game unless they make some DLC.
It’s a hard sell but I give DLC Quest a good 7/10 because it’s an original idea and very creative. You can buy it on X-Box Live in the indie game section for 80 Microsoft points. A Steam (PC) version is coming soon.

The days of hand writing a letter, buying a postage stamp and mailing it out are long gone. Various forms of communication such as social media networks like Facebook, Skype, texting and other forms of instant contact have transformed the platform of how we communicate. In a soci­ety where Twitter and Facebook are the main forms of communi­cation, is email still relevant?
The myth that email is irrel­evant to the younger generation is simply untrue. Many young people are realizing how impor­tant it is to check their email, and many even have more than one email account.
Social media is often dispos­able due to the various networks that people are members of such as Twitter, Facebook, and Insta­gram. With so many feeds and information posted by countless friends daily, it is hard to target a particular person and have per­sonal contact with them. Unlike various social media networks, email is still semi-private and does not broadcast itself all over the Internet for everyone to “like” and “comment” on.
As a college student, email also plays a role in your educa­tion. Sandra Mardenfeld, Assis­tant Professor and Media Arts/Director of the Journalism Pro­gram at LIU Post said, “I think students should use their LIU email. It only benefits them. Stu­dents receive important deadlines and announcements through the email. I, myself, rarely email stu­dents unless I am canceling class or need to speak to them. Most of my communication is on black­board. However, a student might miss an email from me if they did not check their LIU account.”
When attending college, working and searching for poten­tial internships and jobs, check­ing email and communicating with various industries and pro­fessors is valuable to your future. “I never checked my school or personal email accounts,” said Gabriella Ianiro, a junior Journal­ism major. “But I recently got an internship and have to constantly respond to emails from my boss and professors.” I check my LIU email account daily in order to check updates from clubs and professors. Email is a way for the university to send out mass com­munications to students.
Potoula Anagnostakos, a sophomore Journalism major said, “I use email to communi­cate with my friends, family, and at work. I also use it to receive emails from stores and school.” Businesses still use emails to reach clients, customers and em­ployees. With so many stores hav­ing websites online, I constantly receive emails from stores to learn about new sales and trends. Most fashion brands and ma­jor companies now have online catalogs as opposed to sending catalogs in the mail.
In a world that is purely driven on technology, email plays an immense role in communica­tion. Email is a way to keep in touch with people from all over the world. It can be accessed any­where and anytime. Email is fast, simple, and generates an immedi­ate response.

Although it is February, I will not be writing about the Hallmark holiday known as Valentine’s Day. I have written about it in the year’s prior and if you continually read my column, you know I’m not exactly a fan of this holiday. Instead I will be adding on to last week’s column in which I decoded some typical female language. This week, I will help out the ladies with a few things you should never say to your boyfriend.
Literally anything involving your ex-boyfriend/s: “My ex used to…” “I loved when my ex…” “I’m still friends with my ex,” etc. You get the point. No guy wants to hear about this aspect of your past. Not every guy will feel threatened by this, but some might if they are insecure and definitely if it is a new relationship. Trust me ladies, leave your ex’s in the past, where they belong. Remember they are your ex’s for a reason.
Talking about your future marriage/children: Most fe­males plan their wedding in the early years of their life. We dream about how many kids we will have and what their names will be and so on. Guess what? Guys don’t do that, at all. Remember what I said last week about girls being complex and boys being relatively simple. Here’s one fact for you; guys simply do not want to hear about your future children. Talk about it too much and you may as well sign your relationship’s death certificate. It freaks them out.
“Do you think she’s pretty?”: That is a loaded question and every girl out there knows it. There is literally no right answer to that question. If the guy says yes it will lead to the ensuing argument that your guy thinks she’s prettier than you. If he says no you will most likely tell him he’s lying and that he can be honest. Let us be honest with our­selves here ladies, he cannot be honest about this. You will freak out either way. Don’t put your guy behind the gun for no reason.
“Notice anything different?”: Here is another loaded ques­tion. If he doesn’t get it right on the first or second-guess, he’s going to be in the doghouse and you know it. Instead, why don’t you say some­thing like, “I got a new pair of jeans, do you like them?” Don’t set your man up for failure.
“Your friend is gorgeous/charming”: Girls, even if the guy your bf just introduced you to was comparable to George Clooney or David Beckham, do not say it out loud. Think about if your man said that to you about one of your friends who, in your mind, looks like Hei­di Klum or Megan Fox, you would not eat carbs for a month and most likely have a melt down. What makes you think your guy isn’t going to get equally as insecure about it.
“I don’t know/care”: This one in particular drives my boyfriend insane. He knows that nine times out of ten, I’m going to say no to whatever he suggests.
“Maybe later”: This is another thing I say that my boyfriend can’t stand. He thinks that anytime I say maybe, it’s going to turn into a no. Which I can’t say is completely false. I always say maybe with good intentions but it does turn into no a good portion of the time.
Ok ladies, there it is; just a few things that you should definitely refrain from saying to your man. I’m sure the guys reading this could come up with much more. But here are a few helpful hints to avoid any distress in your relationship. Consider it a Valentine’s Day gift from me to all of you.

In January, 2013, the NY State Legisla­ture passed the NY SAFE Act of 2013. Among other things, this statute makes it illegal for firearms in New York to have magazines which carry more than seven bullets. One can understand the State Legislature’s desire, in this instance, to do something in response to the highly-publicized events in Newtown, C.T. in December, 2012. Nevertheless, passing arbitrary restrictions in the number of bul­lets that can be carried in a gun, as the State Legislature has done, seems more like a knee-jerk political reaction that will do nothing to improve public safety.
Dan Potenzieri, a junior political science major, says that the recently-passed NY SAFE Act is “ridiculous” and that the State Legis­lature needs to think “more broadly than the amount of rounds you carry in a [firearm].” On a humorous note, Sama Shokr, a senior international studies major, says “I don’t sup­port any bullets in a gun. I support flowers.”
Gun owners in New York will now be­come lawbreakers if they defend themselves against criminals using a gun that contains more than seven bullets. After the events that occurred in Newtown in 2012, should the NY State Legislature be making it harder for people to defend themselves against those who wish to do them harm?
To be sure, supporters of the SAFE Act in the legislature have indicated that the measure is meant to reduce violent crime, not to attack the rights of “responsible” gun owners as Governor Andrew Cuomo has said. Nevertheless, such a belief relies on the assumption that criminals will somehow be restricted to seven bullets or less in their guns simply because the Legislature has passed a law to that effect. Criminals, espe­cially violent ones, do not obey laws. That is why they are called criminals. Even though they may now be unable to legally obtain weapons with more than seven rounds in a magazine in New York, this does not mean that they will be unable to obtain larger ca­pacity firearms through illegal means. Again, they are called criminals for a reason.
The amount of bullets one needs to defend one’s self against a criminal is simply not determinable by a Legislative act. It is determined by the criminal one is being attacked by and the situation one finds oneself in. In January, 2013, a home invader in Georgia was shot five times by a mom with two young children who used a six-shot revolver. The home invader was able to flee the scene even though he had been shot five times. Nevertheless, if a parent in New York used a gun contain­ing more than 7 bullets to protect his or her children from a home invader, that parent would be considered a criminal under the NY SAFE Act. In this respect, the act is neither “SAFE” nor workable in the real world. If the NY State Legislature desires to promote public safety it should focus on stopping crime, not on punishing law-abiding citizens by making it more difficult for them to protect themselves against harm. Though one does not doubt the well-meaning of the legislators who voted for the NY SAFE Act (it will techni­cally make life harder for criminals) the extent to which it infringes on the Con­stitutional right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms in order to protect themselves is simply too much to accept.

Unless you’re lucky enough to spend the winter months abroad or can hibernate until the spring, you’re going to have to figure out how to stay warm this winter.
Have you ever woken up and thought to yourself, “It is way too cold to get out of bed this morning.” I have, many times. I think it’s safe to say we have all considered staying in our warm beds and ditching our packed schedules in order to avoid the bone chilling weather. What can you do to stay warm this winter?
Potoula Anagnostakos, a sophomore Journalism major, has a few tips of her own to fight the chill. “In order to keep warm, I always have a cup of hot tea, I don’t leave the house without warm socks, and a scarf is a must.” Anagnostakos said when she is home, keeping blankets around the house is a neces­sity during the winter months.
You’re going to think I’m crazy but I dress as if I’m on a ski trip in the ice-cold mountains. I wear thermals under my clothing. Yes, thermals, the layers you wear under your snow pants and ski jackets. They’re perfect! So thin and lightweight, they fit under any outfit. I never leave the house without my hat, gloves and scarf. On really cold days I bring hand warmers with me. They’re little packets that heat up. You can put them in your gloves or just keep them in your pocket. You can purchase them at Ridgeline Ski & Patio in Manhasset NY, located at 144 Plandome Road which is only about 10 minutes from campus. They sell three packs for five dollars. Not only are they inexpensive, they last for more than seven hours!
Kevin Chenicek is a senior Education major plays who plays for the LIU Post Pio­neers baseball team. Their season begins in the cold months of February and ends in May. “During games, I wear Under Armour to stay warm and during the games in early March, a lot of hand warmers are being passed around within the dugout. We also try to keep moving to use our own body heat to stay warm,” said Chenicek. Being an athlete, Chenicek said it’s important to keep warm so that his muscles don’t cramp up.
Danielle Blaney, a sophomore Criminal Justice major, depends on layers to keep her warm. “I wear layers. It’s comfortable and easy for me to do. If I get warm during the day I take a layer off. Easy as that.” Drinking hot chocolate and wearing Ugg boots are Blaney’s two favorite ways to stay warm. Keeping the basic winter necessities such as gloves, hats and scarfs with her at all times keeps her guarded from the cold.
For those students who commute to LIU Post, a brilliant thing to do is to run out to your car ten minutes before you have to leave. Start the car and crank the heat- by the time you’re ready to go your car will be nice and warm. There’s no need to endure the cold while you start your commute.
Apparently none of us are hibernating- use these tips to stay warm and comfortable!

This spring semester, Runway is hosting their an­nual fashion show which will be unveiled this coming April. This fashion show is well known on campus be­cause it has been around for over a decade. With eleven designers and over forty potential models, Samantha Vega, the President and senior at LIU Post, and her loyal Runway staff have their hands full with the current modeling auditions.
Starting off as a model during her freshman year with Runway, Vega has firsthand knowledge of what to look for in aspiring models. As someone who has an exuberant amount of passion for fashion, Vega is in search of those who share the same drive and dedication to this fashion show and the industry in general. When it comes to Runway, confidence is key. The judges have been studying the mindset as well as the appearance of the potential male and female models. The models this year appear to be very anxious to begin the actual work toward the fashion show in April. Although auditions are now closed as of last week, others are still able to show their support towards Runway by attending the final show later in the semester.
One of Vega’s favorite parts of the fashion show is watching the transition occur within the models. Through previous years, Vega recalls models that were genuinely shy and introverted during the initial audi­tions, however when the finalized debut arrived, those same bashful contestants grew into bold and confident runway models. Recognizing that not everyone is born well into their skin, Vega and her staff concentrate greatly on gaining the trust and comfort of the new members to runway. If an audition starts off a bit rocky or the person auditioning is noticeably attempting to crawl out of their bodies, Vega will stop them in their tracks, tell the talent to “shake it out” and start over when they are ready. This may seem very minimal, how­ever, in the moment it takes such a heavy load off of the contestants and provides encouragement to be them­selves in all of their glory.
When it comes to the models role in the fashion show, they are not limited to solely walking up and down the cat walk. Vega and her team often ask each member of the show to contribute ideas and make any type of suggestion they feel will increase the quality of the final project. Vega states that she recognizes the fact that those who audition as models or designers can have previous experience or are members of other clubs and organizations and may have valuable suggestions and concerns that can benefit Runway’s creation.
The talent and drive of the members of Runway is so inspiring in that they truly do care about what they represent and how others perceive their ideas and or­ganization. With so much expectation to show up last year’s event, Runway is more than positive that this year’s show will be an amazing experience that every­one should come out to witness it for themselves! This show is intended to blow the audience away and that is exactly what Runway will do with this year’s annual fashion show.

Thomas Neuschul, an LIU Post graduate social work stu­dent, won the 2013 National Association of Social Workers (NSAW) award. His professor and role model, Dr. Elissa Gif­fords, nominated him for this award.
“I was surprised,” Neuschul said with a chuckle. “I didn’t expect to get the award and I was also very excited and honored.”
NSAW is an organization of professional social workers with 145,000 members, according to the NSAW website. LIU Post encourages social work students to join NSAW by junior year of their undergraduate program. Dr. Gifford has been a member since 1992.
“He’s modest. If you met him, I know you would agree that Thomas clearly demonstrates commitment to populations at risk and the social work profes­sion, and he possesses a love of learning. He is certainly deserv­ing of this prestigious award,” said Dr. Giffords.
Dr. Giffords said the quality of Neuschul that is unique from his peers is his commitment to social work values and ethics. “It seems to come naturally to him. I think social work is a good fit for him and that the profession is lucky to have him,” she said.
Neuschul said he did not know about his nomination for a long period of time before he won. He recalls Dr. Giffords asking to nominate him to make sure he was comfortable with it in late December.
Dr. Giffords had several reasons behind the nomina­tion of her student, who she has known since September 2011. He has volunteered and interned weekly at organizations such as the Coalition Against Abuse and Neglect (CCAN), which is located in Bethpage. At CCAN, he devel­oped a manual to help future in­terns understand the purpose of the program “Project Kidz Talk” within CCAN. After engaging in scholarly research, reviewing textbooks and academic journals, and speaking with staff members, he brought the idea up to CCAN and it let him volunteer to devel­op this tool last summer with the help of Alisha Contreras, group work coordinator at CCAN.
“I didn’t get to address how particularly helpful the profes­sors have been, especially Dr. Giffords, in sort of just helping to gain the skills to help others and to help understand how the practice can impact people from an individual level to a society as a whole,” said Neuschul.
Neuschul has also spent time with children during his field hours working for Child Protec­tive Services (CPS) in Bethpage. He worked at CPS during his first year of fieldwork for his master’s degree in social work at Post. He told Dr. Giffords that he was interested in observing both sides of a domestic case with children who were at risk. He enjoyed watching the improvement of the situations of his clients, although he never takes clients’ achieve­ments as his own.
“I’m really willing and re­ally excited to work with diverse populations and in different settings. I mean, I love working with children, but I’ve also really loved working with older adults,” said Neuschul.
He currently interns at The Long Island GLBT Services Network, which is a place that works to end homophobia on Long Island and make the GLBT community feel safe and at home while advocating for equality. Neuschul works at a senior cen­ter in the Garden City branch.
“They offer alternative services you might not conven­tionally find at a senior center. Many of the clients don’t feel comfortable going to the senior center because they encounter discrimination there, or just don’t simply meet individuals that they relate to so we offer these services—and in addition to that, I also offer counseling,” said Neuschul.
Neuschul currently has six clients that he sees a week at his internship with the GLBT services. “It was at first [hard to remember things about the clients] but it just gets easier over time and you just draw out the important parts. They’re always working towards goals. You don’t necessarily talk about everything with a client. You just talk about what they need to meet their goals,” he said.
Neuschul is also involved with the MSW Graduate Student Association, which performs ac­tivities such as putting together educational workshops and host fundraisers for different causes such as the Family and Chil­dren’s Association. He is also currently organizing a panel to discuss social work practice with the GLBT community. He wants to unite social workers which have various areas of expertise and knowledge.
“No matter what set up I end up in I will service and advocate the GLBT community,” said Neuschul.
Dr. Giffords also reported that she is looking forward to Neuschul’s induction into the Phi Alpha Social Work Honor Society in May 2013.
Neuschul expects to gradu­ate from LIU Post’s MSW pro­gram this May. He is unsure ex­actly what type of job he wants in the social work field because he has so many interests.
“Everyone that I look at, everything, all my classmates, they all are doing so well. I’m not going to say I do not de­serve [to win this award], but I think so many people do…I was excited, I definitely was not ex­pecting to win,” said Neuschul.

With winter still in full mo­tion, January had some unlikely warm days, but all the while a winter wonderland was being created at Post. With that in mind, the club TWIce as Nice announced that it was holding a “Snow Ball” on January 31, from 7:00 p.m. to midnight in the Tilles Atrium.
The feedback from students was enthusiastic. This event of­fered a time for friends to dress up in formal attire and hit the dance floor. Tickets were sold for $5 per person and $7 per couple. Proceeds were donated to victims of Hurricane Sandy.
TWIce as Nice had a “fancy” clothing drive for people who did not have something to wear to a formal event such as this one. A week before the Snow Ball, TWIce as Nice hosted a small event called, “TWIce as faNcy,” where people dropped off old dresses and dress clothes and people were allowed to come and take a dress for free. They re­ceived about eight dresses and a few dress shirts. However, since no students picked any of the clothing, TWIce as Nice decided to donate the dress clothes they received.
Word spread about the Snow Ball through word of mouth and through members on the TWIce as Nice Facebook and Twitter pages. The Snow Ball tickets sold out in just one week thanks to the excitement surrounding the event. Afterwards, the club an­nounced that it would let some people in at the door to help with the demand. The line at the door was so long that some people could not even get in. Around 150 people attended.
Junior Patrick Madden said, “The ball was pretty dope. It was nice to have fun on this campus for once. It was good to be able to unwind and just let loose for a night with friends.”
The event was co-sponsored by LAWS, The Runway, Alpha Xi Delta, SGA, ACP, Student Caribbean Association, NAACP, PAGANS, LASO, LSU, Ball­room Dance Club, Zeta Phi Beta, Dumbledore’s Army, Delta Phi Epsilon, Student Dance Associa­tion, BSU, Alpha Phi Alpha, and Circle K.
Aramark catered the event. Entertainers included DJ Sparkx, a popular disc jockey on the LIU Post campus; student Cody Petit, who sang “Believe” by Josh Groban; student Abigail Dawson, who sang “Love” by Keyshia Cole; and members of the TWIce as Nice e-board and general mem­bers, who performed a tango routine.
Tia-Mona Greene, one of the presidents of TWIce as Nice said, “The Snow Ball was like a dream come true. I seriously didn’t stop smiling the entire night.”
Her twin sister, the other president of TWIce as Nice, Bria-Letã Greene said, “I just want to thank everyone that helped out and attended because they turned a small vision in my head into an amazing night that I never ex­pected to get so big and wonder­ful.”
The twins said they are try­ing to plan more events in the near future, and that the Snow Ball may become an annual event.

At the beginning of each semester, a night of bingo is planned to help students pay for their textbooks. On Monday, January 28, as a part of the Winter Week festivities, the Association for Campus Programming (ACP) and the Commuter Student Association (CSA) hosted their second Bingo for Books of the 2012-2013 school year in the Tilles Center Atrium from 9:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
ACP is an organization where students can become more involved with programs, leadership and campus activities. CSA brings commuters and residents together through on and off campus activities. According to ACPs public relations chair junior Adrian Almonte, there were approximately 180 students in at­tendance.
Eric Zirlinger, senior assistant direc­tor of the Office of Student Life and Leader­ship Development, was the announcer and the offered participants a chance to win up to $1,500, donated to the university through Barnes and Noble gift cards.
There were seven rounds of bingo over the course of an hour and a half. $100 was distributed over the first three rounds. Ev­eryone tried to complete the target pattern while avoiding the infamous “bongo,” which was Zirlinger’s interpretation of a false bingo. However, there was only one of those the entire night.
At the end of the night, there were only seven winners. Of the seven, there were three $100 winners: junior Akilah Cassells, who won the first round by completing a Bingo across, senior Biology major Maethinee Koonvisal, who claimed the second round with the four corner board, and freshman Arianna Rodriguez, who won the third round with a diagonal.
Two $200 winners: freshman Sochima Daniels, who won the fifth round by complet­ing the square around the center ‘N’, and a female, who left before her name could be identified, won the fourth round with two diagonals.
There was one $300 winner, an un­identified male student who also left after his victory conquered the sixth round with an outline of the board and one $500 prize, which was also won by Maethinee Koonvisal in the seventh and final round by completing the entire Bingo card. Koonvisal said, “The event was awesome, now I’m feeling double lucky.”
Other students shared similar reactions. Freshman Political Science and Music double major Natasha Ambria Henry’s second time going to Bingo for Books was, “fun, exciting and disappointing at the same time. I almost had that $200 too!”
Sophomore Business major Bria-Letã Greene exclaimed, “I love Bingo for Books! I go every time…I never win but it’s still awesome.”
Undecided freshman Christina Martinez said, “Bingo for Books was a lot of fun and a great way to socialize and get comfortable with everyone. The prizes are perfection; nothing needs to be changed. I am definitely doing this again.”
There was one concern from the student body. Several students felt that it was unfair for someone to win more than one prize es­pecially for the amount of money involved. At the end of the night, some students said that if someone wins more than once, they should choose which they want and give someone else another chance.

According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this 2012-2013 flu season is likely to be the worst in a decade. Currently, 47 states have recorded cases of the flu. Last year, around 4,400 cases of the flu were reported. This year, there have already been nearly 15,000 and that number is steadily increasing.
The flu is a respiratory disease, which is caused by the influenza virus. Symptoms include headaches, chills, cough, fever, fatigue, diarrhea, congestion, body aches, sore throat and nausea.
The best way to prevent the flu is to get vaccinated. Immunizations are available in a variety of different places such as drugstores, primary care physicians’ offices and on-campus in the LIU Post Medical Services department. Vaccinations are created with antibodies that spread throughout the body after two weeks. These antibodies offer protection against infection with a low dosage of the virus, which is found in the vaccine. The CDC estimates that this year’s flu shot is about 60 percent effective.
The CDC believes that people six months of age and older should get vaccinated this season. People who have certain medical conditions such as asthma and diabetes especially should get a flu shot. It is also highly recommended that pregnant women and people 65 years of age and older get immunized.
“Although I did not get the flu shot this season, I have yet to get the flu. However, I take zinc whenever I feel like I am getting sick. It helps shorten the duration of my cold and speed up my recovery time,” said senior Public Relations major Meredith Minsky.
On January 17, William Milford, director of Medical Services, sent a precautionary email about flu prevention to the LIU Post community. The email details everyday actions that may prevent the spread of germs, such as covering your nose or mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and washing your hands often with soap and water. If diagnosed with the flu, the CDC recommends that people stay home from work or school until they have had 24 hours without any flu-like symptoms.
“I feel like since we’re all in college, we should be mature enough to know how our bodies react to seasonal sicknesses like the flu. For some people I know, they must get the flu shot every year. I personally have never gotten the flu shot since I’ve been going to Post and I feel fine most of the time. If you notice that you’re frequently getting sick, to the point where you can’t function in class if you can actually go, then that’s definitely the time to get the flu shot,” said senior Mathematics major Michael Riggs.
LIU Post Student Health and Counseling, located in Life Science Building room 154, is open Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Flu shots are available in the office for $10. For more information, students should contact Student Health and Counseling at 516-299-2345.
