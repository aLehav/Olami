The men’s basketball team is coming off an 18-12 season and Head Coach Erik Smiles is looking to keep the trend going of an uptick in wins per season. Smiles, now in his third year at the helm, has compiled a 52-37 record and has gone 40-29 in conference play during his tenure.
In order to keep that brand of winning strong, Smiles believes it starts with his two All-Conference players: Jared Hall and Greg Dotson. “It really all starts with those guys and they are two great pieces to build off,” Smiles said.
In addition to the Hall and Dotson duo, Smiles is also expecting big contributions from two other players who logged big minutes last season. “Aary Bibens and Hunter Powell…both of those guys need to have big seasons for us to reach our goals.” While Smiles noted that those four players will play big roles, he didn’t underestimate the transfer and freshmen talent he has on his roster.
Getting acclimated takes time and underclassmen might not pick things up as quickly as others. Smiles agreed partly with that, but offered a slightly different outlook. “With all the new guys on the team we have been going a lot slower installing plays and concepts this year,” he said. “But in the end when the lights go on, it’s just basketball and players are players and they will respond.” According to Smiles, Jamal Mosley and Kyle McLeggan are two transfers that “are really going to impact us.”
Under Coach Smiles a season ago, opponents shot just 38 percent from the field. In fact, with Smiles on the sideline, the Pioneers have been the second and third best defensive teams in Division II in terms of field goal percentage the last two seasons. Smiles was very straightforward in explaining his stance in defense, saying, “We take a lot of pride in our defense and we tell our guys if you can’t guard then you can’t play here.”
With a core group of upperclassmen and young, hungry underclassmen with a blend of transfer students all of whom take pride in defense under Coach Smiles, it sounds like a good formula for a run deep into the season. “Our goal is always to win a championship and I think by season’s end we will definitely have a chance to do that,” Smiles said. “I like our program right now and where we are and if we can stay healthy, I think we will have a chance come March.”
The Pioneers’ season begins on Saturday, Nov. 12, against the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia at the Pratt Recreation Center at 2 p.m. In their matchup a year ago, the Pioneers won 71-55 thanks to a great      all-around game from Dotson who poured in 17 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and was also a pest on defense with three blocks and steals apiece.

The 2016-17 season will be the ninth season with Deirdre Moore at the helm. Since her hire as head coach in 2008-09, Moore has a record of 136-97. Moore and the women’s basketball team will look to grind out more wins this year and improve on last season’s downward spiral when the team went 5-23.
In order to stack up more wins, some things need to change. Coach Moore believes it starts with “focusing on being consistent and working hard.” If that is done, the Pioneers can live with the outcome. In terms of seeing better results on the court, Moore said, “The players, both old and new, have worked hard over the summer and off-season to improve their game.”
Last season, the Pioneers shot 36 percent from the field and would like to see an improvement in that area. Although only slightly better, the opposition shot 39 percent showing the team’s strength last season was definitely its defense. In terms of offensive efficiency though, the Pioneers are working on it. “We have been committed to more competitive shooting and extra shooting,” Moore said. “I also think shot selection will help us increase our efficiency and field goal percentage.”
One big way to improve efficiency on the offensive end is with the three-ball—the ultimate game changer. “I LOVE the three point shot on offense and hate it on defense,” Moore said. “To me the three point shot is a possession and a half. I like to shoot it on offense and we have to defend it well on defense.” A season ago, the Pioneers made and gave up five three-pointers per game. Moore also added that she has some very good shooters with prowess from deep, and it will surprise people how much better they are this year in that department compared to last season.
The Pioneers under Coach Moore have some goals for this season, three of them as a matter of fact. They are keeping them private for now, perhaps using it as motivation. “I would like to see my team compete with the most effort, and intelligently,” Moore said. “One goal that I have is for us to be in our conference tournament and make it back to the National Tournament…I would like to be one of the better teams in our conference and region.”
The Pioneers and Coach Moore tip-off the regular season Friday, Nov. 11, against Pace University at 5 p.m. at the Pratt Recreation Center.

In its first season as a NCAA sport, equestrian tops the region with top placements at every meet throughout the season. The team is now looking to end on a high note at its home show on Sunday, Nov. 13.
“We are all very excited for our show this weekend because we have the home team advantage using the horses that we practice on every week,” said sophomore Jessica Sulkers, high-point rider at the recent NYU/Princeton Invitational. She won both classes in open flat and open fences. “We go to each show feeling confident, but we know with horses anything can happen and it’s important that we all have good attitudes when things may not go our way.”
Sulkers explained that the host of each event assigns horses randomly to the riders. A non-competitor rides the horses in the morning and riders need to figure out their assigned horse’s strengths and weaknesses based on that. “It is as much a mental game as it is ability, because it is so easy to psych yourself out if you get given a horse that looks difficult or intimidating,” Sulkers said.
Before heading into the ring, riders are not allowed to touch anything but to adjust the stirrups. “This is the factor that makes it difficult because you are literally learning the horse as you go, and have to make it look effortless,” she added.
The team currently stands on 196 points, the highest score in the region. Should this remain true after hosting on Sunday, the team would make its way to zones competition—only done before in 2014.
“It’s great not only being successful individually but being part of a successful and winning team as well, it shows that all our hard work is being paid off,” said sophomore Grace Tice, who tied for reserved high-point rider after finishing atop in her open flat class and second in open fences.
LIU’s decision to make the program a varsity sport has made the group stronger, according to Sulkers. The team has attracted more people to the program, is able to practice more often, and can do so with “higher quality horses” donated by the school. “This really makes a difference in being able to make our practices more complex so we then excel at shows,” she added.
The home show will start at 8:30 a.m. at the North Shore Equestrian Center.
EQUESTRIAN for Beginners
Five divisions
Open, Intermediate, Novice, Walk/Trot/ Canter, and Walk/Trot. Riders are placed in the division best suited to their abilities, from beginners in walk/trot to more advanced in open.
Flat v. Fences
The fences class is referring to jumping, which riders do one at a time to a given course. The flat riders are all in the ring at the same time and are tested on their posi- tion (walk/trot/canter). Only the three top divisions have fences.
High Point Team
The coach picks one rider from each division to be the high point rider, and every placing that rider gets goes to the team’s total score.
Block Riders
Each division and class also has various sec- tions, depending on the number of riders in the competition. Those not picked as high point rider act as “blockers”—trying to hinder other schools’ high point riders from amass- ing points in the other sections.
