Last week, hundreds of freshmen began their college careers at LIU Post. Although representatives from the Admissions Office stated that they were not authorized to provide information on the number of incoming freshman enrolled at Post this semester, professors have taken notice of the new faces.
“We have a good amount of film majors this year, nearly 40 freshmen to be exact,” Susan Zeig, a professor of Film, said.
Representatives from LIU Promise, also stated that they were not authorized to provide the number of students in the freshman class, but said “although we can’t give you an exact number, we can tell you it’s about a 50-50 split in terms of who will be living on campus and who will be commuting.”
Freshman Andrew Frank, a Broadcasting major, who will be commuting from Massapequa this semester, plans to take full advantage of the opportunities Post has to offer.
“I can’t even begin to tell you how excited I am for a fresh start. For starters, the campus is beautiful, and the people here are awesome.” Frank said. “I’m really interested in becoming a part of Post’s radio station.”
Freshman Nick Tangorra, a Public Relations major, is also excited about the venues Post offers. “I commute from Bethpage. It’s about a 20-minute ride, without traffic, but I still plan on taking advantage of campus life and might even join a club or too. It’s just a new world for me, filled with new opportunity, and new people.”
“The prospect of going to school close to New York City always thrilled me,” said Freshman Olivia Luchesse, an Education major, who was born and raised just outside of Chicago. “Post is beautiful, and the fact that Post is close to the city, and has a great education program is amazing. Maybe the only thing that’s a little annoying is paying for books, but there is nothing you can really do about that one.”
Luchesse entertained the possibility of becoming a part of Post’s Greek life.
The transition to Post as a freshman can be difficult for some, especially if you’re from a different country. Nora Claus, a freshman exchange student from Norway, whose major is Mathematics, expressed she’s having a tough time adjusting life here in the states.
“It’s a lot different when you go from having your mom cook for you, to cooking for yourself,” said Claus. “I do miss that part about home, but who doesn’t? It’s something you have to adjust to. Other than that I’m excited for this semester; everything is shaping out great.”

The School of Visual and Performing Arts is becoming one college with two schools.
Noel Zahler, Dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, explained that the decision took place nearly two years ago. Starting this fall, the marketing for the new college begins. The college is expected to open in Fall of 2016.
The first school of this new college will be the School of Visual Art, Communications, and Technology, with the other one being the School of Performing Arts.
“Bringing the two schools under one college allows for more collaboration between programs,” Zahler said. In addition to keeping the four programs the school already offers, a new fifth department will be added that includes digital art, design, and gaming.
With the new addition, some repositioning will be happening with the film program that currently resides in the theatre and dance department. The film program is being moved and will be included in the new college.
Students and faculty have been wondering why exactly these changes are being made and how it is going to better the programs.
“It is to enrich the departments by giving students and faculty a more broader range to communicate in,” Zahler said. “The program change will not hinder the students’ education dramatically at all, but hopefully give them that wider prospect of opportunity.”
All these activities will be recognized at a university level, according to Zahler. “Some teachers will start moving locations of offices in August of this year,” Barbara Fowles, Director of the Media Arts Department, said.
The new locations of the programs will be broken up throughout the buildings. The departments are moving around and these changes are being made as well for prospective students to find their programs online and in brochures.
“The breakdown of the departments allow for better visibility, and does make them easier to find,” Fowles said.
While this is all a bit to get used to, it does offer opportunities such as the TV and film departments collaborating together to create documentary films. Gaming will have easier access to work with the digital arts students, and the performing arts students will be able to collaborate amongst themselves to create even bigger productions, according to Zahler.
Some students and faculty are wary of this change, while some are very ecstatic about it, and can’t wait to start collaborating with new departments/programs in 2016.
“The programs themselves won’t change too much, it’ll just give the professors and students more chances to collaborate with other programs in the schools,” Zahler said. Fowles agreed, “It’s not a huge difference, but still it is going to bring a new aspect to the programs already there,” she said.
A school becoming a college is a huge step for any university to take, but Zahler said that he sees it as bringing “a very bright future to the Visual and Performing Arts programs at Long Island University.”

When looking for a new food option, Twisted Taco, opening on campus this fall, will be sure to satiate those with the love for Mexican food.
The first Twisted Taco location was founded in 2002 by Paul Gibbs and Ray Sieradzki. The franchise’s new location in Hillwood Commons next to Subway will be the first one in the Northeast. Their other locations are located down South in: Georgia, Tennessee and Oklahoma. University of Tennessee, Emory University and Georgia Tech are just some of their on-campus locations.
The Twisted Taco campus restaurant opened this fall when LIU Post students returned for the fall semester. According to franchise manager, Darlene Walker, they decided to have an unofficial showcase of their Mexican cuisine while the Summer Honors Institute students were on campus from July 12 to 17. During their showcase, the restaurant offered just a small selection from their full menu, including a variety of street tacos (about seven) and different nacho options.
When Twisted Taco officially opens this fall, customers can expect a lot more from a bigger menu. However, their menu won’t be the complete one that can be found at their street stores, since the LIU Post location is smaller.
Starting this fall, not only will they serve tacos and chips, but they will also be offering quesadillas, salads and customized meals. Customers can choose to have either chicken, steak, ground beef, pork, shrimp or fish in their tacos.
For many college students, Chipotle and Moe’s are their current go-to Mexican restaurants, since they offer a pick-and-choose style menu. However, Walker believes that Twisted Taco is a lot more unique than Chipotle because her company offers more of a variety to its customers. Walker also mentioned how Twisted Taco offers, “18 signature tacos,” and their menu is not just limited to these options.
So far, Walker said that the feedback from the customers has been really good, with many being excited by the new food option on campus. After trying The Hills Chicken Taco (grilled chicken, hot melted queso, lettuce & house-made salsa), DaisyMae VanValkenburgh, a student in the Investigative Reporting Summer Honors Institute at LIU Post, had nothing but positive reviews.
“It had a nice variety of flavors,” she said. “I liked the combination of hot queso and spicy salsa.”
One of Twisted Taco’s most popular taco so far is their Boom Boom Shrimp Taco, which consists of fried shrimp, a special sauce, lettuce and tomatoes – all on a flour tortilla. Another specialty available to customers is the option to get their burrito “twisted;” they can get cilantro, queso and homemade salsa added to their burrito.

Some college students might find video games a distraction from their academic work. This is not true, however, for LIU Post’s game design majors. For them, video games are a part of their academic work.
An undergraduate game design major has been added for the first time this semester. Director of the Digital Game Design and Development program, Ramiro Corbetta, will help guide undergraduate students through the various stages of game development. Corbetta starts with the basics. Before learning how to create a digital game, students must grasp how to create a physical board game and other non-digital games. “The idea there is to teach the core ideas behind game design,” Corbetta said.
Since there are many different types of games, and many different facets of game design, students are required to take computer science courses to make sure they have a “good, basic grasp of programming” as well a few digital design, and audio design courses. “The idea is that we are teaching a really wide range of what it means to make games,” Corbetta said.
Corbetta became interested in game design while he was attending Columbia University. He made the decision to take a semester off to work for a game company, and found a job in game design after college. Corbetta is the designer of the game Sportsfriends, available for download on the Sony Playstation Store and Steam.
Creating any type of game can be a long, and sometimes confusing process. Professor of Digital Game Design, Andy Wallace, who joined the faculty this month, also intends to teach the basics, but stresses the importance of students “getting their hands dirty.” Wallace believes that the process of creating a digital game, from a concept to a playable piece of art, is just as important. “For many of the people in the class, this will be the first time that the idea of creating their own game moves from theory to reality,” he said.
Once students have a general understanding of the basics of what it takes to make a game, he or she can then choose to delve deeper into his or her specialty.
Although Corbetta realizes that certain game designers will focus on their strengths, he believes game designers will start becoming more “polymath” and become proficient in many areas. To get a job, however, Corbetta believes students should “go after the thing that you care about instead of doing something that will get you a job.”
Video games may be used as a stress reliever for children and adults alike after a long day, but that does not mean the job of creating one is without stress. “When you’re making a game, it is very exciting early on, it’s all new ideas and new concepts. The second half of making a game is much more painful,” said Corbetta. “There is this feeling that you’re almost done, and it keeps going and going.” Despite the hurdles and times of uncertainty, Corbetta stressed that perseverance is essential.
The new undergraduate major has piqued the interest of LIU Post junior Graphic Design major, and gamer Daniel Karout. “So many people love video games. They can study and learn what goes into creating games,” he said.

As of July 1, the Tilles Center for Performing Arts bids farewell to longtime Executive Director, Dr. Elliot Sroka. Sroka is retiring after 29 years of work at the Tilles Center at LIU Post. Dr. Sroka began working at the Tilles Center in 1986, which was around the time that the center was named to honor the Tilles Family, according to Sroka. “[The Tilles Family] has now given nearly $10 million to support the arts and arts education at LIU Post,” Sroka said.
Sroka put together countless concerts and great performances with the finest music directors throughout his career. He has worked with a vast array of directors affiliated with varying genres.
Some of Sroka’s most special memories range from working with classical conductors like Seiji Ozawa, James Levine and Michael Tilson Thomas, to great pop musicians like Billy Stritch, John Oddo and Lee Musiker.
Sroka said that there were many good times and memories made while working at the Tilles Center, and it was hard to pinpoint one particular event. From welcoming and presenting artists such as Bob Dylan and James Taylor or presenting the Leningrad Philharmonic just a short time after the destruction of the Berlin Wall, Elliot Sroka has been around for it all!
Sroka said that meeting and working with smart, funny people like George Carlin, Jay Leno, Lilly Tomlin, and Bill Maher were special memories.
There is no doubt that the Tilles Center hosts many breathtaking events and performances each and every year, and Sroka has overseen the magic for many years. “There has always been a wonderful camaraderie within our Tilles staff, campus colleagues, and students,” Sroka said.
At the end of the night, when the curtain goes up and the performers take center stage, Sroka reminds everyone of what is of utmost importance; “It’s bringing artists and audiences together. That is the greatest joy,” he said.
While Elliot Sroka may be on the brink of his retirement, and a search is being conducted for a replacement, the Tilles staff has welcomed Sharon Maier-Kennelly, who has taken on the position of General Manager and Director of Programming Initiatives.
This is Maier-Kennelly’s first position in a university atmo- sphere, but that doesn’t make her unfamiliar with LIU. “My husband was a professor here twelve years before I started working here,” Maier-Kennelly said. Her husband taught in the Earth and Environmental Science Department here at LIU Post.
Prior to starting at the Tilles Center this past January, Maier-Kennelly worked at The Landmark Theater in Port Washington. “I had a theater background before I came here,” Maier-Kennelly said. Maier-Kennelly saw this position as a, “wonderful opportunity to work with a great team at a beautiful theater.”
For those whom may not be familiar with the Tilles Center for Performing Arts, there are actually two theaters located inside the building; one with seating for 490 guests, and another capable of holding over 2000 audience members.
Maier-Kennelly and her team have the privilege of programming the schedule at the Tilles Center. They are the ones working behind all of the action and magic that brings the Tilles Center Stage to life. However, she also works on the production side of the performances. “I get to oversee all the different kinds of activities that come through the building,” she said.
As the Tilles Center for Performing Arts bids farewell to Execu- tive Director, Elliot Sroka, and welcomes General Manager, Sharon Maier-Kennelly, preparations for the upcoming 2015-2016 are underway. Be sure to check out the schedule of events for an outstanding line-up!

LIU Promise hosted its Student Employment Day on Friday, Sept. 11 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Tilles Center. Over 250 students showed up looking for a variety of on and off-campus employment opportunities.
After checking in at the Tilles Center atrium, students browsed the tables of over 40 different departments. Various opportunities were available, such as: LIU Promise, The Pratt Center, and off-campus opportunities included Bethpage Credit Union.
“Student Employment Day is a one stop shop for students,” said Ali DiBona, the Senior Associate Director of LIU Promise. “They can find a job and complete the hiring paperwork all at Student Employment Day.”
Chris Casey, the representative for Bethpage Credit Union, has been coming to this event for four years looking for a student ambassador to promote and market Bethpage’s services. He is also on campus representing Bethpage throughout the year.
“The eagerness of the students has been fantastic,” Casey said. “The turnout has been great, the students are engaged, and it’s worth their while.”
Marisa Vessenmeyer, a freshman Biology major, hoped to find a job to earn some extra money. She said her friend was able to receive hours and start work study quickly, and she was able to find a similar job.
“I also like all the opportunities to meet new people, and all of the different opportunities on campus,” Vessenmeyer said.
Candra Carter, a senior Sociology major, attended for the second year in a row.
“There were a lot more job opportunities, especially on-campus businesses,” Carter said, referring to Bleeker Street, The Dollhouse, The Pioneer Wagon, and the Twisted Taco, the new campus restaurants, stores, and cafes.
Although several of the students who attended agreed that the event was set up nicely, and it was a good opportunity for students, there is room for improvement.
“They could have made more posters or sent more emails to help spread the word,” Vessenmeyer said.
Although Student Employment Day is only held once a year, students can visit career.liu.edu for more information about on-campus employment.

“I couldn’t stand to see animals in pain,” said Dr. Stacy Gropack, who originally planned to be a veterinarian. However, always sensitive to the suffering of others, she was unable to pursue her original dream. For this reason, her mother suggested that she look into the field of physical therapy. Now, LIU Post has Dr. Gropack’s mother to thank for a new addition to the staff. Gropack began as the dean of the School of Health Professions and Nursing on July 1.
At the time that Gropack’s mother suggested physical therapy as a possible career choice, Gropack knew little to nothing of the field. However, she attended school for the subject and proceeded to fall in love with the work.
“It’s a wonderful profession. I get to help people really maintain and get back the quality of their lives,” she said.
Gropack is a New York native. She was born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y. and moved to Long Island about 18 years ago. Gropack studied at LIU, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in health science and a master’s degree in physical therapy, subsequently earning a PhD from NYU and a license as a physical therapist.
Gropack is an accomplished health care professional who still finds time to continue her work in physical therapy with developmentally delayed children as a consultant for a special needs preschool in Brooklyn.
Gropack’s new position at LIU Post is far from her first experience working for LIU. Gropack began working at LIU’s Brooklyn campus in 1990. She became the Associate Dean for the school of Health Professions in Brooklyn before she was hired as the Dean at LIU Post.
From Gropack’s short time here at LIU Post, she said that she has come to realize that because the Post campus is more spread out than Brooklyn’s, she is unable to have as much contact with faculty and students as she previously had on Brooklyn’s closer campus.
Gropack said that the students and faculty she has met here at LIU Post have been both very responsive and very kind. She has also perceived that her coworkers in the School of Health Professions and Nursing are extremely committed, and work to create a successful and ever growing environment.
Gropack headed the LIU Summer Honors Institute course in the field of health care at LIU Brooklyn from July 19-24. She has headed the health care summer institute program on the Brooklyn campus for three years, and hopes to bring a similar summer institute in health care to the Post campus in the future.
Gropack hopes that as she works here, she will begin to improve the Post community by implementing new programs focusing on the necessities of the local people and work force. Additionally, she hopes to increase the visibility of, and strengthen each program currently offered by her school.

A monthly Crime Blotter is provided to all of our readers as a public service on campus. Below is a list of recent crime data included from the logs available to the public at the Office of Public Safety.
Damaged Vehicle
On Sept. 3, a 2008 Silver Toyota Highlander was reportedly vandalized at the Tilles Loading Dock. The complaint states that he parked his personal vehicle at approximately 10:00 a.m. At approxi- mately 10:45 a.m. a Tilles staff member informed him of the damage to the vehicle. The damages included large scrapes to the driver’s side and quarter panel of the vehicle. The culprit has yet to be identified.
Confiscated Keg of Beer
On Sept. 6, a Public Safety Officer was called at approximately 10:05 p.m. He was assigned to a large gathering in the Brookville Hall North Side Alcove Area. While moving the crowd out of the area the officer observed a keg of beer. No person(s) claimed ownership of the keg at the scene. The Keg was confiscated and brought to the Public Safety headquarters on campus.

As the summer comes to a close, and students have moved back into the residence halls at LIU Post over Labor Day weekend. Residence Assistants were already all moved in a week beforehand in order to get everything prepared for their residents to arrive. Residence Assistants do things such as make door tags for their residents in hopes of making them feel more at home as soon as they arrive.
This year, all eight residence halls are open including Riggs Hall, Post Hall, Brookville Hall, South Residence Complex, Suffolk Hall, Nassau Hall, Queens Hall and Kings Hall. Last year, Kings Hall was being renovated and has now opened up as a primarily freshman residence hall. South Residence Complex also known as the suites, has transformed into a twenty-one and over resident’s hall only. All eight buildings were buzzing with activity throughout the entire weekend. There was furniture, televisions, refrigerators and clothes at every turn as freshmen and seniors alike moved their belongings to their second home, some for the first time and some for the last.
Volunteers from sports teams and Residence Assistants helped students with check in, moving objects and settling in. Many parents and families were helping as well. “I’m really looking forward to starting a new chapter in my life here at Post and meeting new people. I thought I would be more nervous, but the people here made it easy,” said Lauren Hiraldo, a freshmen Dance major who moved into Queens Hall.
Though this was only Hiraldo’s first move in day, it was a sad event for senior Hannah Breed. “I’m really going to miss my roommates and coming back to live with them each year. It’s sad that this is the last time I’m moving into Riggs Hall,” Breed said.

This summer, some LIU Post students got the experience of a lifetime. Professor Neill Slaughter took a small group of students on a cultural art tour through Europe to experience art in a completely new way. On the tour, the students visited museums in London, Paris, and Amsterdam.
Professor Slaughter, who teaches drawing and painting, watercolor, and other art classes at Post, decided to pursue art as a career when he was 19 years old, traveling for three months unaccompanied throughout Europe.
“Seeing in person all those art treasures that up to that point in my life, I had only seen pictured in books,” Slaughter said, “made a profound impact on me and helped me focus on pursing art full time when I returned to college.”
While in these cities, Slaughter and his students also visited the Alnwick Castle, where Harry Potter was filmed, the Windsor Castle in Versailles, France, which Slaughter describes to be “so opulent it is difficult to describe adequately without seeing it in person,” Rembrandt’s House, and the Ann Frank house.
“It is difficult to say which city is most impressive,” Slaughter said, “because each city is so distinctly different from the others, which is why I chose those cities, to provide a wide array of architectural monuments as well as different languages and cultures.”
Slaughter explained why he chose London, Paris, and Amsterdam as locations for this trip. “I had been to each of these cities numerous times over the years and knew each city had world class art museums. Each city is unique in its architectural appearance.”
This was not the first art trip Slaughter has brought students on. In 2011, he guided students through France and Italy on a similar tour, and in 2013, he brought a class to Turkey and Greece. Slaughter mentioned that he would consider taking students to Europe again, and change the venue if students expressed interest.
“I encourage all my students to travel abroad because I know from my own extensive travel and teaching abroad that experiences of this kind broaden ones cultural and aesthetic horizons,” he said. “I try to foster an awareness in my students of the enriching, mind-expanding experiences that are unique when encountering art and foreign cultures first hand instead of simply reading about them in a book or viewing a video in a classroom.”
Slaughter did not make this trip available to his students only. He posted fliers in the studios where he teaches on campus; however he welcomes any interested students on his trips.
Slaughter hopes to take LIU students on another trip this fall to see the John Singer Sargent, an exhibit the group had seen in London, at the MET in New York City.

Going to college can be both super exciting and a little nerve wracking. There is so much change that you don’t always know what to do. The good thing is that everyone goes through their first year at college at some point. It’s not something that you can avoid or skip over, and each person has a different experience.
“The beginning of the semester is an exciting time for students; however, it can be overwhelming getting adjusted to college life,” said Ali DiBona, Senior Associate Director of LIU Promise. “I think the best thing to do is get involved in the first few weeks of the semester, attend events, join a club, visit your Success Coach in LIU Promise, and talk to your professors. There are so many resources available to all students at LIU; be proactive and seek them out!”
College is all about what you make it, and getting involved through on campus connections will help ease your adjustment to the new school year.
“I love the amount of freedom in college, and I love how available things are to you,” said Katherine Keaney, freshman Musical Theatre major. “But the workload seems like a lot, which I’m nervous about.” Although many students may feel overwhelmed with the workload, there are so many resources on campus, such as the library, LIU Promise, and tutoring, that can help students find the right technique to master the art of being a college student.
“For most, coming to college is a new, exciting experience, and for others it can be a bit scary,” said Arianna Livreri, Campus Life Coordinator. “It’s a different environment, with a group of diverse people. Be open to new experiences, and don’t be close-minded to meeting people outside your circle; your best friend will end up being the last person you thought you would talk to.”
There are a variety of activities to get involved in, like Greek life, clubs, organizations, and athletics. “I feel lucky that I was able to transfer here, and I’m excited to get the chance to start over and be able to do what I love to do here at Post!” said Kaitlyn Curci, a sophomore Musical Theatre major. There is always something going on campus, and the best part is if you don’t find something that’s right for you, you can always create it.
“Get involved in anything and everything,” Livreri said. “Don’t be afraid to ask questions, the staff and faculty are always here to help. Enjoy what’s provided for you on this campus to get your full experience. Step outside your comfort zone.”
It’s great to get involved and have fun because college is all about your experiences and memories, but after all, your academics are important, too. It can seem a little overwhelming once you take a look at your syllabi and think you won’t have enough time to do everything, but with the right time management skills anything is possible.
“To start the school year off right it’s important to know where your classes are before the first day, and get yourself mentally prepared for the large amount of work you will have to do,” said Stephanie Adelson Bray, a junior Public Relations major. “It is also important to plan ahead so you are not swamped with multiple assignments and exams.”
Although it seems cliché, college is what you make it. “Be the best you that you can be and everything will fall into place,” said Sam Fare, a junior Public Relations major. It’s always good to take advice from others, but everyone develops their own method to their success, and that’s what will help make you first year memorable.

Getting back into the routine of classes after having four months of vacation can be pretty hard, especially if you spent your summer going to the beach everyday, going out at night, and literally not having a care in the world. When September comes around it can feel like a rude awakening when you are stuck having to wake up for an 8 a.m. class. Although it’s hard at first, students tend to find a way to accommodate to this not so new routine.
But the start of a new semester doesn’t always have to be a bad thing in the eyes of students. Senior Associate Director of LIU Promise, Ali DiBona, claims that students may even be happy about the start of a new semester.
“They get to see all of their friends they missed over the summer,” DiBona said, “they get to know new faculty, start new classes and see all of the exciting changes that have been taking place on campus over the summer.”
However, both DiBona, as well as many college students themselves, think that there are ways to make this transition easier.
1. Start Early
During the summer students are doing anything besides thinking about classes, but it would actually be a good thing if they prepare in advance. “Students should check their MyLIU on a regular basis to review their courses, check their email for important updates, ensure they have their textbooks, and understand where their classes are located,” DiBona said. “The more they prepare before the semester begins the easier the transition will be.”
2. Get Yourself Organized
During the first week of class pick up a calendar and a notebook. “If you organize all of your work straight out from the first week things will be less stressful,” said Ben Brinton, a junior Musical Theater major. “Writing down all of the dates that you have tests or work due will help so much with getting used to the routine since it will help plan out a schedule, giving you the advantage of not waiting for the last minute to do work and still enjoying free time.”
According to DiBona, taking a look at a course’s syllabus on the first days will help students understand what the expectations for the semester are.
3. Set Goals
Carly Nelson, a senior Art Therapy major, has her own motivational way of getting back on track. “At the start of a new semester, once I get a sense of what my professor expects or wants from me, I like to
set some type of goal for myself,” Nelson said, “whether it is by getting a certain grade in a class or achieving my ideal GPA. I really do think that setting goals is a great way to motivate yourself at the start of the semester.”
Nelson finds that this has helped her throughout her years at Post where at the end of each semester she likes to take a look at how she accomplished those goals and what she needs to further work on.
4. Reward Yourself
“College students are adults, they should know themselves to understand when they need a break and when they need to keep going and work hard,” DiBona said. Students have the freedom of controlling their own schedules; therefore DiBona considers that it is their own responsibility to be sure all of their assignments get done.
Brinton thinks that it’s good for the students to reward themselves. “For everything you accomplished on that week or even day reward yourself with some free time either going out or catching up on your favorite TV show. Remember that you need to not only take care of your schoolwork, but also of yourself,” Brinton said.
Getting out of your summer routine does not have to be a hard thing, following these steps will definitely help students get ready to get back into school mode. Getting involved in all the activities that are going on around campus is another big recommendation from DiBona.
“I think the best way to transition into a new school year is to dive head first into all that LIU Post has to offer,” DiBona said. “Step out of your comfort zone, meet new people, make new friends and become a part of something you typically wouldn’t get involved in.”
Of course every student is different and each student probably has their own way of getting into the new school year, but following tips from other college individuals and professionals is always a good thing to do, and perhaps can help a student find their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to the start of a semester.

The first day of school… a little anxious, sort of excited, but pretty scared to see if the classes you have chosen have a good teacher, understandable content, and friendly peers. But what else helps us, as students, relax, and welcome the semester with open arms?
Feeling ready and prepared is massive for me. I couldn’t just roll out of bed, chuck some clothes on and rush to class in the first week. I have to wake up with plenty of time, shower, eat a good breakfast, put my makeup on, and dress as us Europeans do.
This applies to punctuality, as well. The creak of the door to a silent classroom, the turn of 30 heads at once, putting you into the center of attention, then having to mutter “Sorry, I’m late,” because you panicked when the teacher glares at you. From that moment, trying to find a seat, which is most likely in the middle of the classroom, of course isn’t the greatest way to set a good example to your classmates or professor, nor does it set you up for a good start to the day.
Getting books, pens, notepads and all the other academic accessories, which are required for a “bursting out the seams” semester,
is another important move in the game of academic chess. The obvious candidate would probably be department stores, such as Target. They provide all the necessary tools to become the most ready student on campus.
I may seem like a little bit of a hypocrite for trying to preach such readiness, because I am actually the schmuck who didn’t do this before the term started. Therefore, I am actually trying to prevent you guys from feeling like the “helmet” I am feeling like at the moment. It’s not great!
One massive factor that I feel extremely strongly about is the attitude of the teacher. For me, the first impression of a teacher on a student is equally important as vice versa. This initial greeting and first explanation of the subject syllabus is key to engage any student, and to gain their respect as well as their attention to keep their mind stimulated in excitement.
For example, I made the decision to take philosophy this semester with the wise guidance from our very own Alex Billington, Co-Editor- in-Chief of the Bottom Line magazine. When I walked into class, the energy was instantaneous: positive, humorous, and unperturbed. Professor Alexander Najman was the sole reason for this brilliant, atmospheric experience.
His enthusiasm and excitement for the knowledge he wanted to convey to the 30 students in his class was admirable, and for someone like myself who reacts to this type of teaching, it gave me an instant, positive outlook on what the course is going to entail. His manner in which he spoke to us was almost “hip” to the usual professor with tenure. Maybe this is because he is much closer to us in age and generation? Either way, it makes a huge difference.
Many of us here at Post have that same dull boredom when we have a teacher who is monotone and halfhearted in their teaching of their subject. They must remember that we are young adults who need to be engaged, and we need tutors who can inspire our developing minds and imaginations. This may mean during the “add-drop” week that you research or ask your success coach if he is a good teacher, and has good reviews from other students.
These factors are the difference from going into the semester with a negative mind. Do whatever you can to enjoy what you are here for, besides the partying and degenerate memories; this academic sustainability of knowledge is what you’re paying for!

Editor-at-large
It’s that time of year when college co-eds begin making moves into their dorm rooms before the new semester begins. Wholesale stores like Target and Bed Bath and Beyond are packed with students making last minute purchases; the hallways of residence buildings are accumulated with weeping parents; and newbies are settling in to their home away for home for the school year.
But what if you’re a bird who has opted out of flying the coop for college? According to U.S. News, “on average, about 19 percent of freshmen commuted or lived off campus in fall of 2013.”
Having lived both on and off campus during my college years, I’ve realized there are significant advantages to taking the drive as opposed to paying the pied financial advisor. On the flipside, there is something very liberating about waking up just five minutes before class starts. Listed below are some of the pros and cons of commuting to college:
1. Pro: You have access to a sustainable meal plan.
There are two places on this earth that I am regretful to say I’ve eaten at: Sleepaway camp and Winnick. When I lived on campus as a sophomore, I longed for my mom’s home cooked meals. Not only was home food more enjoyable to eat, but it was also healthier than the grub served up at school. I evaded the “freshman fifteen” because I wasn’t eating spoonfuls of Nutella in my dorm at two in the morning (I’m not proud of this). It was this past semester living on campus that I packed on the pounds – I found myself eating out more and binging at Wendy’s more nights than I could count, all to avoid the unsatisfying school food. Being a commuter offers you opportunities to vary your diet since you’re not limited to a less-than-good-for-you meal plan.
2. Con: Waking up hours before class.
One of the things I’ll miss most about living at school is the thrill of sleeping in. As a commuter, if I had class at 9:30 in the morning, I’d set my alarm for 7 a.m. to give me ample time to get dressed, eat breakfast, and set off on my thirty-minute commute. On campus, I would wake up 20 minutes before my first class and get there, on time, without the hassle of running into random traffic delays. Another damper about driving is dealing with the weather, especially during the winter months, which are far from wonderful in our area. In times of inclement weather, commuter students are often at odds when receiving cancellation updates from administration. One special case at Post involved a student making it all the way to campus in a snowstorm only to find out upon arrival that classes had been cancelled that day. On-campus living warrants no worry of having to drive through hazardous conditions, or finding a decent parking spot (don’t even get me started on this one).
3. Pro: Quiet hours last all-day.
Aside from my undeniable dedication to schoolwork, my 4.0 se- mester was a result of living at home the first year. Without the distraction of floormates, getting work done was a breeze. When I lived on campus I would shack up in the school’s library, or plug in my headphones to block out my roommate’s obsession with the E! Network, but nothing boosted my work productivity more than sitting in my own room, or in my neighborhood library. The familiarity of those spaces somehow honed in my focus, and thus produced A-worthy assignments. Living in a college dorm room can mess with your priorities, like how you would skip that much-needed study session to attend the rager in your residence hall. 4. Con: FOMO is a living, breathing thing.
The hardest part about commuting your first year is feeling like you’re missing out on “the freshman experience.” You know, attending parties where you don’t know anyone but are then immortalized when you complete a five-minute keg stand? Kidding aside, if you’re commuting to school this fall, you will feel this sense of un-fulfillment for the first couple of weeks. Facebook and Instagram, your social media safe havens, will soon become your worst enemies – their feeds will flood with your friends’ on-campus revelries, and you will soon regret staying home. Don’t let this deter you from making the most of your freshman year.
5. Pro: You have much more of a reason to get involved.
To continue the point I made in number four, the most important thing to do at college is to enjoy yourself. Commuters by reputation are expected to drive to school, go to class, and then drive home; this is not the case. Any aspect of your college experience, whether academic or social, is determined by one person: you. This can be done by joining clubs, Greek life, playing a sport, or just hanging around the commons. What saved me from transferring out my first semester was writing for The Pioneer – it was something that kept me engaged in student life, allowing me to network with all the diverse groups on campus. As cheesy as it sounds, it also helped me make a couple friends along the way. So I say unto all my fellow commuters today: break the stigma – stay on campus after class; there might be more going on than you think. 6. Con: Flying under the radar is tough if you’re living under their roof.
When I moved onto campus, I found myself staying out way past my bedtime, not having to clue in mom and dad of where I was or who I was with, something that often happened when I lived at home. What’s even more liberating than waking up seconds before class is going to a private beach with your best friends at midnight on a Monday. These sort of serendipitous adventures only took place while I was taking up residency at school, which leads me to believe that dormers have more fun. You think things will change since you’re “in college,” but that doesn’t mean the saying “my roof, my rules” is null and void.
7. Pro: Money and comfort – you can have it all.
Last but not least, commuting to college saves you and your family the burden of shelling out extra cash for room and board. I was very lucky to have received free housing during my year as a resident, but the going rate of housing (sans meal plan) is a whopping $12,000 per academic year. And in my experience, the residency facilities are simply not worth the coin. Commuting not only keeps your wallet happy, but also eases your overall being. Nothing kills a shower more than having to wear flips flops, or finding used Band-Aids and strands of hair all over the stalls. Along with taking showers in all their rejuvenating glory, living at home means you still sleep in your own bed! Huzzah!

The 2015-16 academic year at Post has just begun, and new students coming from high school have just started to get their collegiate feet wet, warming up to their new classes, professors, and shifting their focus from once familiar territory to the now unconditioned setting of college life.
With the switch in location, and the academic pressure that goes along with it, it’s only natural that some incoming students may feel nervous about the changes.
If you’re a new student that has nerves about switching from high-school to college, don’t let it drag you down if you can help it. Truth be told, the nerves are a natural part of the process. However, on the other side of the coin, a 2015 study reveals that worries and nerves relating to college, have reached an all-new high.
According the article “Fragile Mental Health” by Jake New, “the emotional health of incoming freshmen is at its lowest point in at least three decades.” Students are also reporting that that they’re spending more time studying and less time socializing with friends, according to the article.
In the article, Kevin Eagan, director of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the University of California at Los Angeles, said, “Students who come to college feeling depressed and not emotionally well tend not to graduate; they’re much more likely to leave an institution, and that should be worrying.”
However, despite how grim these studies may look, in retrospect, these studies are compact and made out of individuals like you, the student. While it’s natural to have college worries, finding ways to feel comfortable where you are all depends on your willingness to think positively and be optimistic, and these are some tips and suggestions to help you do just that.
These following tips are derived from Study.com, based from the article, “20 Proven Tips and Tricks to Breeze Through College” (May. 30, 2011):
1. Set up goals for yourself
Small goals and long-term goals. Set up small goals to breakdown your coursework into manageable sections; ones that you can take on when the time is right. As for longer goals, try to organize deadlines for yourself, because planning your work around the “personal due dates” you make up for yourself can help serve as a motivation tool to finish that specific task.
2. Strengthen your writing skills
Improve your writing-technique. Practice in writing is very important, as it will serve as a core, academic tool that will help you get through not only college, but also help you shape essential skills for later on in life. Improving your writing abilities, be it at school or at home, can only help in the long run.
3. Get involved
Join the college community. Investing your time in extracurricular activities during your stay at college, like a group or a club, can help to alleviate stress, even on top of all your coursework. It would definitely be worth it to explore and check around. Who knows? You may find something that you won’t just be interested in, but love!
Hopefully these tips of advice helped to relieve some stress on their own. If you’re a new student and feel overwhelmed, just remember to take a deep breath, and take every task one step at a time.

As another semester starts churning its wheels, the greatest season for arts and entertainment of the year is rapidly approaching. On our campus, there are more events and happenings than can be counted on ten fingers. With everything ranging from theatre through music, to art exhibitions and filmmakers coming to talk, there is undoubtedly something for most of us. Here are the major events.
The Steinberg Museum in the Hillwood Commons starts its fall with an exhibition of the works of faculty from the School of Visual and Performing Arts. The show is evidence of the diversity that the faculty has, with works in many different mediums, including painting, printmaking, sculpting, video and digital design. Not only will the diversity of media be shown, but the different interests of the faculty. The exhibition opens on Sept. 14, and is up through Oct. 24.
Museum hours:
Monday – Friday 9:30 – 4:30
Wednesdays 9:30 – 8:00
Saturdays 11:00 – 3:00
WCWP will continue its series of live radio plays in cooperation with the Port Washington Play Troupe and is setting up a production of H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds, written in the 1890s. In the play, Martians invade Earth. The book appeared on radio in 1938, when Orson Welles told the story, leading people to believe it was true, and the Troupe will be reenacting this broadcast.
There will also be an open audition for those interested in joining in on the broadcast. The audition will be held Sept. 16, in the Hillwood Recital Hall. The live show will take place on Oct. 29 at 8 p.m. Tickets and more information is available at www.wcwp.org.
Post Theatre Company kicks its fall off with a play called Venus, written by Pulitzer-prize winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks. The show portrays a 19th century African put on show around Europe as “The Hottentott Venus,” due to her physical characteristics. The show sheds light on racial stereotypes that still exist in today’s society. The play will be performed Oct. 9-11 and Oct. 15-18 on the Little Theatre Mainstage.
The Film Program is hosting a Welcome Back evening on Sept. 24, at 4:30 in the studio in the Kahn Discovery Center. There will also be a screening of an independent film called Foreign Puzzle, in the cinema in the Hillwood Commons, and the filmmaker, Chithra Jeyaram will be there for a Q&A prior to the screening.
On Nov. 9, filmmaker Morgan Spurlock will be on campus. Spurlock, most known for his film “Supersize Me,” will be talking and screening his new film in the Hillwood Commons Cinema at 7 p.m. This is in connection with the Gold Coast Film Festival, where students also show their short films. The date for the showcase will be announced at a later time.

LIU Post alumni Dayna Ghiraldi, who graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, produced one of the latest horror films “OLD 37.” The movie focuses on the premises of two brothers who intercept 911 phone calls and show up to the scene in an old ambulance where they kill and torture hopeless victims. The film stars big horror film actors, Kane Hodder and Bill Moseley, as the main brothers. Miley Cyrus’ sister Brandi Cyrus also makes an appearance.
The movie was in its entirety filmed on Long Island, and there was a weeklong special screening at the Glen Cove Theaters. Writers Paul Travers and Ghiraldi gave two special Q&As after the screening on Saturday, Sept. 12, where they talked about the movie and the process of making a low budget film.
Travers started to write the script back in 2005 and it took him about five months to finalize it. “At first I didn’t even think of making an actual film. I was just kind of writing down ideas,” Travers said. “The idea first came to me after I had a nightmare and I woke up and thought that this would be a great idea for a horror film, so from there I just started to look up scripts online to follow the format and as I drove back and forth from Long Island to the city, I would just come up with the
story.” The part of Jon Roy in the movie was actually written with Hodder in mind, Travers said. “I actually met him at a Fangoria horror convention and I told him about my script and told him what it’s about and he really liked the idea so he gave me his information and asked me to send him the script,” Travers said. Hodder and Moseley were really into the characters, which helped a lot with the filming.
Travers, along the producers of the movie, raised all the money for the movie. The filming started in 2012, but needed to take a break when they realized they needed to raise more money in order to complete the film. They were able to raise enough money to begin filming again in 2013 and the movie was finally completed in 2014.
“I have a lot of ideas for a sequel, but we are hoping that somebody will come on board and pay for it, so I don’t have to spend so many years raising money for it,” Tavers said.
Ghiraldi, a LIU Post alumnus and owner of the PR firm Big Picture Media, did all of the PR and marketing for the movie. “Watching him [Travers] make something from nothing made me want to really get involved,” Ghiraldi said. “I don’t have the film knowledge, but I’ve got all of the relationships. The clothing companies, makeup companies, and all of the music in the films were clients from Big Picture Media.”
“We also started to create buzz on the film early on,” Ghiraldi said.
Brandi Cyrus was one of the first actresses attached, so being Miley’s sister, it helped the press get excited.” It was also the first time that Hodder and Moseley played brothers together, which Ghiraldi claims also helped create a buzz for the movie.
Marisa Kofmehl, a Senior Public Relations major, also helped with the movie when she interned at Big Picture Media this summer. “I got to help a lot with promoting the movie and helping with
their social media, so it was a lot of fun to actually see the final product of the film on the big screen,” said Kofmehl.
The movie won Best Feature and Best Film at Montreal Comic Con, and will be premiering Oct. 2 at the Bushwick film festival. If interested, the movie will be playing at Glen Cove Theaters until Sept. 17; it will be coming out on VOD on Sept. 29, and will be available on DVD on Oct. 6.

Yes, the summer is over. Am I happy about it? No. What I am happy about is the start of this column. After two years as the Arts and Entertainment editor, I have passed the torch over to the very capable hands of Mr. Bendik Sorensen, but it isn’t the last you’ll hear from me.
This column is the start of roughly a year’s worth (we all gradu- ate eventually… hopefully) of cultural musings and analysis — I can only hope some of you will stick around to read it. Each week I will discuss a new topic from the Arts and Entertainment world (and I consider Donald Trump entertainment, so he may have a mention or two). But first, it may be a good idea to give you all a low-down of some of the big happenings over the last few months and entering these dwindling days of summer.
The political 2016 race is on, with one G.O.P. debate and a few Twitter wars already in the past. What we may not have anticipated, however, is the announcement by Kanye West that he will be running for president in 2020.
If you haven’t heard, the hip-hop artist, in an allegedly under- the-influence awards speech at the MTV Video Music Awards on Aug. 30, declared his rou for presidency while on stage. Is this a joke? Will an album called “Yeezuz for President” be hitting the shelves soon? I don’t know. Imagine Kim Kardashian as First Lady (neither can I).
Other VMA notables: Miley Cyrus/Nicki Minaj beef continued, as the latter called out the former regarding questionable comments said during an interview, with a few curse words thrown into the mix.
There were quite a few smash hits this summer at the box office, but a significant number of flops as well. “Jurassic World” raked in over $200 million in its June opening weekend, ranking the top domestic hit for the season. Other notable mentions are “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Straight Outta Compton” — two films that were on the lips of nearly everyone during the summer, receiving mostly positive reviews.
“Fantastic Four” flopped with an underwhelming $25 million on its opening weekend and scorching reviews, clocking in under 10 out of one hundred on Rotten Tomatoes. Director Josh Trank, known for his prodigal debut feature “Chronicle” in 2012, publicly denounced his new film on Twitter, before taking down his post. This fall marks the start
of the Oscar season, with highly anticipated films like “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” “The Revenent,” and “The Martian” slated to pack theaters and redeem the scandals of the summer.
If you have any suggestions for this column, such as a topic you would like discussed, feel free to contact me at peter.barell@my.liu.edu. Until next week, adios.

Coming off a loss on Wednesday at the hands of Merrimack College, the Pioneers came out firing against Assumption College on Saturday, Sept. 12, outshooting their opponents 23-2. Even though they tallied more shots, the Pioneers found themselves down a goal near halftime.
Senior forward Per Forgaard changed that when he found senior midfielder Matias Ruiz who scored the equalizing goal. Keeping with the theme of day, the Pioneers got more scoring chances and cashed in when freshman forward Charlie Ledula gave LIU the 2-1 advantage. That score stood for the rest of the match as the Pioneers earned their second win of the young season. They return to the field Wednesday, Sept. 16, at 3 p.m. against Wilmington University.

Trailing by 12 points midway through the fourth quarter, the football team used its late-game heroics to mount an impressive comeback against East Stroudsburg University on Sept. 3, at Eller-Martin Stadium in East Stroudsburg, Pa.
In his Pioneer debut, junior quarterback Jeff Kidd paved the way for the Pioneers (1-0) in their final two possessions. Needing to score quickly, the Green and Gold moved the ball to their own 46-yard line. Kidd then tossed a 54-yard touchdown pass to red-shirt sophomore wide receiver Kyle Ward, making it a 40-35 game.
Shortly thereafter, LIU forced a three-and-out, causing a momen- tum swing as the Warriors (0-1) were forced to punt. Kidd and the offense got back to work and completed a couple of passes to set up shop at the ESU 37-yard line. He then hoisted the game-winning 37-yard touchdown pass to red-shirt junior wide receiver Shane Hubbard.
The Oregon-native looked sharp in his Pioneer debut, completing 29-of-45 passing for 381 yards and three touchdowns. Two of his three touchdowns came in the fourth quarter as he connected with Hubbard and Ward. Red-shirt junior running back Michael Williams scored the other touchdown on a 41-yard screen pass from Kidd. Senior tight end Sean Binckes finished with 76 receiving yards on seven receptions and a touchdown. Ward led the Green and Gold with 101 receiving yards.
Red-shirt freshman running back Malik Pierre was a dominant force on the ground for the Pioneers, rushing for a game-high 117 yards on 11 carries. Pierre had a 47-yard burst in the second quarter to set up a six-yard touchdown by junior running back David White, which put the guests on top 7-6.
Down 19-14 in the third quarter, Pierre had a 16-yard carry to set up shop at the ESU 11-yard line. On the following snap, red-shirt sophomore wideout James Higgins took a handoff and tossed a jump ball into the end- zone, which was hauled in by Binckes on a trick play, giving the Pioneers a 20-19 lead. Post tacked on a two-point conversion, putting them ahead
22-19. On the defensive side of the ball, red-shirt senior linebacker Brandon Cheney collected six tackles and one sack while red-shirt junior defensive back Justin Ortiz and junior defensive back Clarence Sears chipped in with seven tackles apiece. Red-shirt junior defensive back Kareem Folkes also contributed with an interception along with four stops.
Post’s defending Northeast-10 champions returned to action on Saturday, Sept. 12, in their home opener. They won a 40-31 nail-biter against Assumption College in a conference showdown at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
After jumping in front 26-25 midway through the fourth quarter, the Pioneers (2-0) recovered a fumble on the Greyhounds’ (1-1) four yard- line. All seemed to be said and done as Williams scored on the following play to give the hosts a 33-25 lead with only 1:16 remaining. However, Assumption was not done yet. Sophomore quarterback Marc Monks connected with freshman receiver Deonte Harris for a 36-yard touchdown, with just 37 ticks left on the clock, making it a 33-31 game.
Although the visitors failed the two-point conversion, they recovered the onside kick. LIU was back on their heels, but Harris put an end to all hopes of a comeback. He put the icing on the cake with an interception he took 46 yards for a touchdown. This put the Pioneers ahead for good as the Greyhounds comeback effort came up short.
There was sloppy play on both sides of the ball as each team turned the ball over three times, piling up penalties in the process. Kidd was able to salvage an impressive 11-play 75-yard touchdown drive in the fourth quarter to give his team a 26-25 edge. Kidd crossed the pile-line on a quarterback draw from the 10-yard line on a 4th and 1.
He finished the day 23-of-36 for 230 yards with one touchdown pass. In addition, Kidd scrambled for 47 yards on seven attempts with one score. Ward caught six of those passes for a game-high 102 yards and a touchdown. White was impressive on the ground with 66 yards on five carries. His backfield mate, Pierre, also looked sharp with 13 carries for 60 yards. Binckes acted as a huge security blanket, as he led the team in receptions with eight for a total of 51 yards.
Harris shined again defensively as he recorded nine tackles and 2.5 sacks. The red-shirt junior also snagged a pick six and forced a fumble in the late stages of the contest. Cheney led the squad with 11 tackles while sophomore defensive lineman Kevin Petit-Frere dominated the line of scrimmage with 10 tackles, 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and his LIU Post squad will travel to Manchester, N.H. on Saturday, Sept. 19 to take on Northeast-10 foe Saint Anselm College. Kickoff is scheduled for noon.

Coming off a loss to Merrimack College earlier in the week, the Pioneers looked to respond against Stonehill College on Saturday, Sept. 12. After a scoreless 45 minutes, LIU grabbed the lead courtesy of a goal by senior forward Susanne Vistnes. Less than ten minutes later, Vistnes found the back of the net again to make it 2-0 in favor of the Pioneers.
After a goal by Stonehill cut the lead in half, the Pioneers netted two more goals, the latter by sophomore forward Alex Lynn, and cruised to a 4-1 victory. The Pioneers are back in action against Caldwell University on Thursday, Sept. 17, at 4 p.m. in New Jersey.

The field hockey team opened up its 2015 season at home against Bentley University on Saturday, Sept. 12, and gutted out a thrilling 3-2 victory on overtime.
After a quick goal by Bentley at the 3:26 mark, the Pioneers found themselves behind in the game — a position they were rarely in during the last two seasons. The Pioneers got their first tally of the match in the 34th minute via sophomore defender Grace Ilias. Just about five minutes later, the Pioneers struck again. This time it was senior forward Keliann Margiotta, who found the back of the cage off of a pass from sophomore forward Kaycee Zelkovsky.
The Pioneers played a stellar first half, outshooting their opponents 10-1, and they carried a 2-1 lead into halftime. Their stellar play continued into the second half, but they were unable to stop freshman midfielder Rachel Crowley, who tied the match at two in the 63rd minute. The stalemate continued throughout the rest of the second half, and eventually an extra period was needed to decide a winner.
The Pioneer defense stood tall in the overtime and allowed only one single shot. In fact, they held Bentley to three shots for the entire game. Because of that defense, the Pioneers got plenty of scoring chances and capitalized on one of them. Off a blocked shot in front of the Bentley goal, Ilias scored her second goal of the day, giving the Pioneers the thrilling overtime victory.
The Pioneers returned to the field on Sun- day, Sept. 13, to battle with Saint Thomas Aquinas College. The Pioneers were led by sophomore midfielder Alyssa Lopresti, who notched her first collegiate hat trick in a 6-0 victory for the Green and Gold.
Perhaps inspired by Lopresti’s first goals as a Pioneer, freshman forward Emily Miller tallied her first goal of her LIU Post career in the 11th minute, making it a 3-0 game. The Pioneers carried that lead into the break and didn’t waste any time increasing it. Less than two minutes into the second half, Lopresti netted the final of three goals for the afternoon on a put-back attempt in front of the opposi- tion cage.
Later in the match, freshman forwards Amanda Flynn and Molly Cunha joined Miller in notching their first goals at the collegiate level, rounding out the scoring for the afternoon, giving the Pioneers a 6-0 win. Defensively, the Pioneers had another fantastic game, allowing a measly two shots and letting none of them hit the net.
Head Coach Raenee Savin and the Pioneers play their next home game on Saturday, Sept. 19, when they take on Merrimack College. The game is scheduled for noon.
