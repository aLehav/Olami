Winter snowstorm Nemo shut down the LIU Post campus for two days. The snowstorm, which brought in a total of 11.4 inches, caused school officials to suspend classes for the rest of the day on Friday, February 8. Blizzard warnings started to go off on people’s iPhones in classrooms, dorm rooms, cars and homes the day before at 4 p.m. Thursday’s temperature was mild, but the blizzard erupted the next morning.
The message that classes and events were cancelled after 1:30 p.m. was posted on the LIU Post homepage around 11 a.m., the morning of the blizzard.
Though the Provost office was unable to comment about who makes the decision on whether or not to cancel classes, a representative from the Public Relations Office issued the following statement: “The weather can be unpredictable. The university does track the storms but sometimes we receive information from Nassau County of Emergency Management. We make decisions of school closings with the information in our hands.”
Last semester, Hurricane Sandy and then Long Island’s Nor’easter crippled the campus for a few days. However, a message that school events and classes were suspended the day before Sandy actually struck Long Island. Yet, classes resumed on the day that the Nor’easter was supposed to touch down. In similar fashion, classes and events were cancelled for the remainder of that day as well.
Commuter Nicole Piro, a freshman Adolescent Education major, said, “It would probably be better knowing ahead of time if the campus is closed because it’s great knowing you can stay safe at home and not worry about making a trip to and from school in terrible weather.”
Victoria Brady, a sophomore Psychology major, said, “I feel like we should know ahead of time because for the commuters it’s hard to find out at last minute.”
However, the lack of notice is not only a problem for commuter students. Diana Zysk, a freshman International Business major, who dorms on campus, said, “Though it is easier to deal with going to classes because I’m already on campus, it is still hard to get around from class to class in the aftermath of this blizzard.”
The LIU Post website notified students at 7:15 a.m. on Monday, February 11, that classes were still scheduled for that day. The website said, “We recognize some students may be unable to commute to campus as a result of the storm. Students unable to attend class should contact their faculty member for individual arrangements.”
Paul Kalis, sophomore Business major, said that early Monday morning, “I was unsure if school is opened today because I hadn’t received any news before I was supposed to leave home for school. They posted a notice online at 7:15 a.m., but I had to be out the door by 6:30 a.m. due to the fact that I had class at 8 a.m.”
Andrew Morales, a freshman Business major, said, “I try to assume that Post is opened until we receive a memo saying otherwise.”
No matter what the weather forecast predicts LIU Post students must know that school closings, just like the weather, can at times be unpredictable.

Tomorrow, February 14, is Valentine’s Day, and Post students are planning romantic days with their significant others. According to Dr. Karen Sherman, a professor of Psychology and also a psychiatrist who focuses on relationships, it is important to show your love. “Anytime you have these kinds of celebrations it is important to acknowledge them, especially for women, because it’s a marker for your love, and some people feel that it needs to be recognized.” The Pioneer has made a list to assist you and your better half on what you can do on Valentine’s Day.
Go big or go home – Surprise your girlfriend or boyfriend by going to New York City. There are a lot of Valentine’s themed events going on. Visit Times Square and share a kiss in front of the heart sculpture “Heartwalk”, and even if you feel it might be too early to get married, you can watch couples renewing their vows on the glass Red Steps in Times Square. You can go ice-skating in one of the many different ice rinks in Manhattan. Central Park, Bryant Park and Rockefeller Center are just some of the places where you can impress that special someone on the ice with smooth motions and high jumps. If you are feeling lucky, Rockefeller Center offers an Engagement on Ice package, where you have time alone on the ice with your favorite song playing, including a champagne toast, if, of course, you are over 21 years old. After you have won him or her over by showing your skills on the ice, you can seal the deal with a ring and a grand gesture. For more information, go to www.rockafellercenter.com/iceskating. Afterwards, you can go to any nearby restaurant and have a toast for your love. For Maria Kotti, a junior International Business Major, the decision to spend Valentine’s Day in the city with her boyfriend was obvious, “We will probably go to our favorite place: Brooklyn Bridge park and thereafter enjoy a bottle of wine and watch a movie”
Romance on campus– If you live on campus and feel worn out after class, stay on campus and turn it into a perfect evening. There will be a special Valentine’s Day theme at the Winnick Center. Specialty cookies, cupcakes, a heart shaped cake and dessert decorating is what’s on the agenda, to make campus more romantic. Invite your loved one to enjoy a meal there and afterwards return to your room to spend quality time together. Ask your roommate if you could have the room for the evening to make it even more special. Tune up the vibe with some sweet music. Try “In Love With You” by Erykah Badu, “The Only Exception” by Paramore, or perhaps “Halo” by Beyoncé. The selection is endless. A perfect gift to give your girlfriend or boyfriend is a mix tape of all the songs that remind you of her or him. This, of course, could be a gift whatever your evening plans might be.
Homebound – If staying at home is the right choice for you, there are plenty of romantic gestures you could do. Browse Netflix’s Romantic Movies section and find something you may like. For example, the romantic drama Waiting For Forever with Rachel Bilson about never giving up on love, or perhaps the classic Breakfast At Tiffany’s with Audrey Hepburn about trusting yourself to fall in love. Cook a romantic dinner to go along with your movie. On the website www.allrecipes.com you can find an entire section just dedicated to Valentines’ Day dinners and desserts. Top off the evening with a romantic evening walk in the winter landscape. This can also be the perfect time to give your loved one a gift, whatever it might be.
Long distance mgic – You might find yourself alone on Valentine’s Day, with your significant other somewhere far away. Perhaps he or she is traveling, or lives abroad. Turn it around and make it magical with a perfect day planned for the loved one. Start the day off with special delivery. Order flowers, as late as the same day, at the website www.proflowers.com. Then, tell them that you are waiting on Skype, where you are ready to video chat. Dress up in fine evening clothing and make your room romantic with lit candles, or fake candles if you live on campus. While online, take the time to appreciate each other’s company. Talk about your day and make sure you tell your loved one how much you lcar about them. Just because you are not physically with each other does not mean you cannot make the day special. Kristiane Aateigen, a junior Journalism major, bought a fill-in-book to her boyfriend, who lives in Norway. The book is about love and their relationship; each person can fill out things about the other. Kristiane says, “I think it’s nice to send something personal to let your partner know that you spend time and effort to make them happy.” Since her boyfriend can’t take her out to dinner, she will be going to Tao in the City with a friend.
Don’t stress it – If celebrating Valentine’s Day is not for you, do not give in to the stress. It does not have to be a big deal. However, just because you do not want to do anything extravagant on Valentine’s Day, you do not have to ignore the day all together. Talk to your partner and make sure you are on the same page. Spend the day with each other, and do what you usually do when you are together. For Henrik Søberg, a junior Film major, Valentine’s Day is nothing that needs to be a big deal. He says, “I have never focused much on Valentine’s Day, but I guess every opportunity to celebrate love is an opportunity to seize.”
Professor Sherman states, “For some couples, they might feel it is not important to celebrate Valentine’s Day, and at the end of the day it is the essence of the holiday [love] that is the most important thing.” So it might not be all too bad to just take it easy, and enjoy each other’s company without making big fuss of it. According to Professor Sherman, the most important thing to do is “show your love, appreciation and let them know they matter.” After all, there is not a better way to show a person that you love them, than by simply saying “I love you.”

Some might think that you could only fall into two types of categories on Valentine’s Day; in a relationship or single. As an experienced college student, I know that is just not the case. There are hundreds of different titles you may fall victim to and even worse, there might not be a title at all. Whichever situation you are in here’s your guide to surviving February 14. (That’s Valentine’s Day men and its tomorrow so you better be prepared)
 
Long Term Relationship: So you’ve been dating your girl for what seems like forever and you both seem to agree that Valentine’s Day is kind of dumb. “We love each other everyday, why do we need a special day to prove it” blah blah, we’ve all heard something along those lines from our significant other. Well gentleman, I came across an interesting tweet yesterday:

(Keough is engaged to Kyle Bosworth, linebacker for the Jaguars)
Of course she expects all of this on Valentine’s Day. I promise you. Would you expect her to expect anything else? And men, even if she doesn’t expect this, then it sure as hell won’t hurt your relationship either. Go get her the flowers and some chocolates. Don’t forget the sweet and sappy card.
Couple With No Title: You as an individual, are one half of the couple that everyone knows is a couple, but you just won’t say it. It’s kind of a good thing for you I guess, because this girl really won’t expect the real fancy gifts with all the trimmings. But, that could also make it harder. So what do you do? I think a safe bet would be to plan to spend the day together and maybe get her a single rose or something. A day like today might also put your relationship into perspective for you; if you knew that you would be spending the night with her and were totally okay with that, maybe it’s time to make it official. Or not, whatever.
Long Distance Relationship: You’re at college and she’s…well not. If you’ve made it this far into the year as a long distance couple then congratulations! Also, if this is your first Valentine’s Day away from each other, it might bring up a whole lot of emotions in her. I’m sad, I’m happy, I love you, I’m sad. No one wants to deal with that. Make her feel extra special. I’d go the chocolate covered strawberries route. And if you don’t have plans on when you’re going to see each other next then the best gift of all would be to make definite plans on when you will see each other next. It’ s not goodbye babe, it’s I’ll see you later.
Hooking Up: I’m no expert, but I do know that there are a number of you out there that are up for anything but a relationship. However, if you’ve been hooking up with the same girl all semester, things are bound to get a little awkward around V-Day. You might want to ask her out on a date, you might not. She’s most likely wondering if you will or you won’t. If you think you might have some feelings for this girl then all I’m going to say is a box of chocolates never hurt anyone. Write a funny note and stick it on the box, making her laugh will take away the awkwardness of stepping out of your element to give it to her. If you’ve been hooking up with someone all semester and know that there’s no potential for a relationship, ever, then just leave it at that. You don’t have to do or say anything at all, but be aware that she will get the point and may be a little bitter next time you hit her up for a booty call.
Single: Being a single man on Valentine’s Day could mean a number of things. You can go about your Thursday as normally expected and probably not even realize it’s Valentine’s Day. Or, you could go out with your buddies and have some “Thank god I’m single” drinks. If you do go that route I’d advise you to not take any girl you meet out very seriously. Most likely, she’s out with her friends celebrating being single as well, and bashing men. She might have some kind of built up anger for your kind. Whatever it is that you do, I’ve heard first hand from men that avoiding single girls might be a good idea. And send your mom some flowers, she’ll like that.
Currently Popular: Online Relationship: (This one was Catfish inspired) I’m not really sure how popular this one is among Post students, but hey it’s on MTV so obviously it has to be legit. If you’re in an online relationship this Valentine’s Day and haven’t met the person yet, then you should make it a personal goal to meet the person. If you have met them, refer back to “Long Distance Relationship”. That is all.
Whichever one of these circumstances you find yourself in on this Thursday, just remember if you’re into a girl you cannot go wrong with flowers. You simply cannot. Yes, it is a “Hallmark holiday” but when your girlfriend goes online and sees a hundred uploads of flowers and chocolates then even your previously decided agreement that ‘you won’t be celebrating Valentine’s Day this year’ will seem foolish to her. Other than that, remember that come Friday you won’t have to think about this again for a whole year. And buy your mom some flowers.
Men, email us your thoughts on Valentine’s Day, we’d love to hear. cwpstpnr@gmail.com

February is here and while for me that means one month closer to spring, for others all that comes to mind is Valentine’s Day. As the middle of February approaches, the shelves in almost every store are stacked with chocolate and teddy bears, flower shops are arranging orders of rose bouquets, and Victoria’s Secret flaunts their sexiest lingerie fit for the Valentine’s Day occasion. It seems as if everywhere you turn coupledom is accentuated at an all-time high. However, what happens when you’re just one and not a part of a couple. As a girl, how can you survive Valentine’s Day being single?
It is so easy to fall into the category of the bitter, miserable female rambling on and on, on social networks about how irrelevant this day is to you. This year let’s decide not to be that girl. Instead of moping around, get up, get out, and enjoy the day. That’s what senior Art Therapy major, Xochlith Roman did: “A couple of years ago, my friends and I threw a party on Valentine’s Day but we called it Singles Awareness Day. Instead of wearing red, everyone wore black. We had drinks, food, and music. The location was decorated with stars instead of hearts. It ended up being the best non-Valentine’s Day celebration ever!”
Here are some other tips to help you enjoy Valentine’s Day; after all, it is a day of expressing outward love to anyone you love, not just to a boyfriend or girlfriend.
Begin the day with a positive attitude. No matter what, avoid thinking of that special guy you don’t have and instead think of all the special people that are currently in your life.
Plan a day-date with your mother. A lunch date and a little shopping sounds like a beautiful bonding experience to me. After all, moms do know how to make everything better.
If Mom’s working or busy celebrating the day with her other half then…
Have Dinner with your Friends. Share the latest scoop with your best friends in one of your favorite restaurants. There’s no infinite feeling like the one you get, hanging around those that know you best.
Or…
Cater to the Most Important Person in your Life, Yourself. This may sound a bit cliché but the best love is self-love. Treat yourself to a manicure, pedicure, and or a massage. Get a hold of your favorite magazine and indulge in a few trinkets. Want a teddy bear, visit your nearest Build-a-Bear store and build yourself one. Feeling for some chocolate? Buy yourself some! It’s Valentine’s Day, most, if not all stores are dedicating an entire aisle to chocolaty delights.
Lastly, know that it will be a Great Day. Even if you don’t have someone to send you flowers or candy, every day is worth enjoying.
I hope some of these ideas will allay your fear of Valentine’s Day approaching. Just remember it is one day so why not make it unforgettable. Besides, by the time you look it’ll be February 15, the day after Valentine’s Day.

The Pioneer recently spoke with country star Chris Young who is continuing his 2012 Liquid Neon Tour. His latest single, “I Can Take It From There,” has climbed to #18 on the country charts. He has five consecutive #1 singles at country radio with a platinum certification and four recent hits certified GOLD by the RIAA. Over the summer, Young joined Miranda Lambert as her special guest on her “On Fire” tour. More recently, he joined Brantley Gilbert to tape a cameo appearance on ABC’s Nashville, a musical drama starring Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere, in the episode “You Win Again” which aired on January 23.
Young will be performing at the NYCB Theatre at Westbury on Sunday, February 17 at 8 pm. Tickets are $29.50 and can be purchased on LiveNation.com. You can follow Chris on Twitter @ChrisYoungMusic.
The Pioneer (TP): You have been touring with big names like Miranda Lambert, Alan Jackson, Rascal Flatts, Blake Shelton, and Jason Aldean. What is something you have learned from these seasoned veterans of Country Music that you can use for your own tour?
Chris Young (CY): One of the things I’ve learned from touring with some of the biggest names in country music is how much diversity there can be in your set. If you look at all those artists from Alan Jackson to Miranda Lambert to Jason Aldean, it’s a pretty wide range as to how they set everything up and what songs they put in their shows, including covers. It really opens up the possibilities as to what I can do when I’m headlining my own shows.
TP: By the looks of your schedule, you practically live on the road. What is the one thing that makes you feel at home no matter where you travel?
CY: We just got a Keurig coffee maker for the bus. It’s great to be able to wake up and have freshly brewed hot tea or coffee to start the day without leaving the bus. It’s great! I also had a road case built for my Golden Tee arcade golf game so me and all the guys in the band can have tournaments on the road.
TP: With three albums out, you have a number of hits. What is your favorite song to perform to a live crowd?
CY: Right now my favorite song to perform live is ‘Tomorrow’ from my new album NEON. I love how as soon as we start playing the opening guitar licks of the song the crowd starts losing their mind and cheering. Our fans are also loving the new single ‘’I Can Take It From There” and that’s getting a big response too.
TP: The last year has brought Gold certifications, multiple award nominations and five #1 singles. What goals do you have for 2013?
CY: I’d love to have another Gold record with the new album NEON, I’m really proud of the music that’s on the record. I also want to tour as much as we possibly can so that we can get out and see everybody. There are a lot of cities that we didn’t make it to last year where we’re getting requests from the fans and so we want to get out there as much as possible to play and tour.
TP: What keeps you grounded?
CY: Without a doubt my family keeps me grounded. They’re the kind of people who will keep you in line and keep your head on straight.
TP: When did you first know that you wanted to pursue music as a profession?
CY: The first time I got up on stage with a band I knew I loved music. I never questioned it all the way through high school or college and knew without a doubt it was what I wanted to do.
TP: Who were your music inspirations growing up?
CY: Keith Whitley has always been one of my musical heroes. I recently had the chance to play one of his old guitars on the Opry stage. That was an awesome experience.
TP: Who are your current inspirations in today’s music?
CY: I love Blake and Miranda. The music they make is different but equally cool. I’ve had the chance to work with them and they’re both just great people.
TP: A lot of country artists have been mixing some entertaining covers into their live set lists. Are there some surprises your fans will get from your live show that they would not expect just from listening to your albums?
CY: We like to cover everything from ZZ Top to Stevie Wonder in my live shows. I think sometimes people are surprised by some of the songs we mix in to our sets but I’ve been influenced by a wide variety of genres and so I like to share some of my favorites with the fans.

American college students only seem to care about the four major American sports: Baseball, Football, Basketball and Ice Hockey. If you are a true sports fan, you should read up on what’s going on in the other sports around the world.
Let’s start with the English Premier League. The battle for the championship seems to be between the two clubs from Manchester: United and City. At the moment United tops City with 12 points, after City gave away 3 points to Southampton Saturday, February 9, and United did not miss a beat as they won comfortably 2-0 at home against Everton. If the Red Devils keep their recent form, nobody can stop them from celebrating their 20th league championship in May.
All the way on the bottom of the table we find the ambitious Queens Park Rangers, stuck with only 17 points. Another group of 4 teams battle with QPR to avoid the three bottom spots, which results in relegation from the Premier League.
Further south in Europe we find the Spanish La Liga. Barcelona has a safe distance down to the two Madrid based teams Athletico and Real on respectively 12 and 16 points, on top of the table. Both Real Madrid and Barcelona won their home games this weekend, while Athletico Madrid lost to Rayo Vallenco on the road. Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, who scored 91 goals during 2012, is the league leading goal scorer with 35 goals. Number two is not surprisingly Real Madrid player Cristiano Ronaldo, who has found the back of the net 24 times so far.
Soccer is not the only big sport in Spain though. One of the world’s leading tennis players, Rafael Nadal returned to the world tour this week, after almost seven months on the sideline due to a knee injury. Nadal missed the 2012 London Olympics last summer, and played his first ATP tournament in Chile this week. Even with over half a year on the sideline, Nadal proved the world tennis elite that he belongs among them, as he advanced to the final both in the single and double tournament on Sunday February 10th. Unfortunately he lost both games, but can look back at a successful comeback on the court.
So let’s move from Chile to another country with high mountains: Austria. Austria hosts the 2013 Alpine Ski World Championship. Wednesday, February 6 was the Men’s Super G competition. Ted Ligety from the United States won, while Gauthier De Tessieres (France) and Aksel Lund Svindal (Norway) joined him at the podium. Tina Maze from Slovenia won gold medal for the women with Laura Gut (Switzerland) and Julia Mancuso (USA) came in second and third.
Saturday, February 9, the stage was set for the men’s Downhill competition. Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal took his second medal, as he won the race ahead of Dominik Paris (Italy) and David Poisson (France).
The upcoming week holds plenty of interesting sporting events. The Biathlon World Championship is unfolding in Nové Město, Czech Republic this week, in addition to the Alpine World Championships that will continue in Schladming, Austria, through Sunday, February 17. If you are into golf, you should know that the players on the PGA Tour have stopped in California to play the Northern Trust Open at the Riviera Country Club in exclusive Pacific Palisades this week, with final rounds on Sunday.

The LIU Post Pioneers men’s basketball team bounced back after a tough loss to Molloy College on Saturday, February 2 with two consecutive victories against Queens College on Wednesday, February 6, and Roberts Wesleyan College on Sunday, February 11.
The two wins help move the Pioneers to 15-6 on the season and 10-3 in East Coast Conference play.
Wednesday’s 78-60 win over Queens College was led by senior guard Tobin Carberry, who dropped 22 points. Junior forward Vaughn Allen scored 16 points of his own and senior guard Jonathan Kohler finished the game with 10 points.
Queens quickly jumped out to an early lead to start the game and with just under 16 minutes left in the half they had a 7-4 lead after sophomore forward Patrick Modzelewski hit a three pointer. But the Pioneers quickly tied it up after Allen completed a three-point play to tie the game.
A little over a minute later, two made free throws by Carberry gave LIU Post their first lead of the game, and by the 9:48 mark they had extended it to a double digit lead.
By the 4:57 mark the Pioneers had acquired their largest lead of the night, beating Queens 30-11, a 19-point lead. LIU Post would end the first half with a 40-25 cushion.
Queens slowly chipped away at the Pioneers lead in the second half, cutting it to 10 points at the 15:53 mark. Junior guard George Holmes cut the lead to eight after making two free throw shots, but the Pioneers would put their foot back on the pedal and get the lead back into double digits.
Holmes would again knock the Pioneers lead back down to eight at the 6:06 mark and would cut it to just six a minute later. But Carberry would score 14 points in the final five minutes to help secure the Pioneers 78-60 win.
LIU Post followed up the win over Queens with a dominating performance over Roberts Wesleyan on Saturday.
The Pioneers shot 47 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range. Kohler led the team with 18 points, while Allen had 12 and Carberry contributed 11.
Like the previous game, it started out with the opponent jumping to an early lead. But as quickly as Roberts Wesleyan got the lead, they relinquished it just as fast. Kohler hit a three-pointer with about 14 minutes in the half to give the Pioneers a 12-11 advantage and they would never look back.
The Pioneers’ lead hit double digits at 7:32 after freshman guard Dillon Burns hit a shot from behind the arc to make it a 12-point game. Carberry hit a three with 1:10 left in the first to give the Pioneers their largest lead of the half, 19, and ended the first half with a 46-28 lead.
The second half produced much of the same results as the Pioneers continued to outplay Roberts Wesleyan.
With nearly 13 minutes left in the game, the Pioneers accumulated a 20-point lead after sophomore forward Charles McCann converted on a jump shot. Freshman guard Emile Blackman gave LIU Post a 68-41 lead after finishing a fast break with a slam-dunk. And junior forward Amir Tarif made it a 29-point game with 1:12 left in the game. The Pioneers would end the game with a 28-point victory over Roberts Wesleyan.
LIU Post’s next game is on Wednesday, February 13 in the nation’s capital when they take on the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds (3-18) at 7:30 p.m. The men follow the women’s game, and pregame is slated for 7:00 p.m. All of your Pioneers basketball coverage can be found on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org.

The LIU Post women’s basketball team suffered their second consecutive loss on Saturday, February 10 to the Roberts Wesleyan Redhawks (11-10) by a final score of 70-66. With the defeat, the Lady Pioneers (14-7) snapped their home winning streak at the Pratt Center of 17 straight wins dating back to December 30, 2011 in a non-conference battle against Franklin Pierce University.
In a game that was originally supposed to be played on Saturday, February 9, and then was delayed 30 minutes the day of the game due to a leak in the ceiling at center court, the Lady Pioneers could never establish a rhythm offensively. In addition, as a result of not being able to play with a wet spot on the floor, the game was played on a side court (still regulation length).
Lady Pioneers’ junior guard Kenyatta Sears led the team in scoring as she dropped 19 points on an efficient 6-12 shooting performance from the floor. Sears’ offensive prowess kept the Lady Pioneers in the game as she nailed five of her six attempts from beyond the arc, but it was not enough. The Lady Pioneers as a team shot 31% from the floor, and if you don’t include Sears, the rest of the Lady Pioneers went 5-23 from three-point range.
At the end of the first half, the Lady Pioneers went on a 7-0 run and trailed 32-27 to the Redhawks. Although it was a five point game, the Lady Pioneers labored through the first half and had a challenging time getting inside the paint for buckets. Through the first half, the Lady Pioneers were 3-13 from beyond the arc, and 8-19 from everywhere else on the floor.
The second half was a similar story for LIU Post as the Redhawks went on stretches of solid play on both sides of the ball, with the Lady Pioneers unable to answer back. Three points was the closest the Lady Pioneers ever got to the Redhawks and that was when the score was 46-43 with about 12 minutes left. The Redhawks kept finding a way to extend their lead as it routinely felt like it was a three or four possession game. After yet another Sears three-pointer, the deficit was narrowed with about five minutes left to play as the Redhawks only led 57-53. But once again, the Redhawks pulled away and went on a 13-6 run to make the score 70-56 with just under two minutes left to play.
The Lady Pioneers made things interesting to close out the game as they displayed toughness and did not give up as a 10-0 run cut the score to 70-66 with 21 seconds remaining in the contest. However, it was too little too late as neither team would score for the remainder of the game. The run of made baskets and stops on defense was needed with more time for the Lady Pioneers to make up a few more points.
Redhawks’ sophomore forward Marissa Sell had a monster game as she had the game-high in both points (24) and rebounds (16). As a team, the Redhawks shot 46% from the field. An odd statistic is that the Lady Pioneers once again won the turnover battle. The Lady Pioneers nearly had their season-low in turnovers as they only had 12 for the game. On the defensive side of the ball, LIU Post also forced 22 turnovers on the Redhawks, but the Lady Pioneers were unable to capitalize.
The Lady Pioneers have a quicker turnaround than normal as their next game is on Wednesday, February 13 on the road against the University of the District of Columbia (8-15). There is a 5:00 tipoff, with 4:45 pregame which can be heard on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org.

There is peace for 99 minutes. The world outside our living room is one struggling with conflict and harmony, yet for almost two hours we are witnesses to the wonders of the world. We find amity—we find a flawless rhythm in themes we are all too familiar with.
The documentary “Samsara,” written and directed by Ron Fricke, who has also directed the similarly-styled 1992 nonverbal film “Bakara” and worked as the cinematographer for the film “Star Wars II: Revenge of the Sith,” takes the viewer on an intimate, guided trip through twenty-five countries while exploring life and death, age-old traditions, and the ever-present cyclic representation of time.
Fricke developed these themes using a carefully customized pallet of stunning visuals and calmingly eclectic mix of natural sounds, oriental and tribal chimes with the ever-present calming rhythm of meditative music. Literally, no words can describe watching nearly a thousand male prisoners clad in orange jumpsuits carry out a flawless dance routine in front of what is presumed to be a female warden.
However, Fricke lacked a clear storyline and memorable themes. Yet, what he lacks here he makes up in composition. The screen blackens, but then ash and red, hot magma careen across the screen and you know you’re witnessing a volcano erupt and strangely it seems as if this is the first time you’ve seen such a thing. You almost feel like sweat is dripping down your forehead as if you were there.
Another noteworthy characteristic is Fricke’s use of juxtapositions. He compares an assembly line spewing out product after product with that of endless consumer waste. He pairs an image of a machine wrangling up cow after cow with that of an overweight group of people indulging in beef burgers in a fast food restaurant.
Perhaps the film, which was criticized by The New York Times for lacking a specific message, is about the balance and parallels of life. Where he shows land, he shows water. Where he shows life, he shows death. When we see a stereotypical image of tribesmen, we see aberration in the form of a sweet bond between a daughter and her cumbersomely tattooed father.
Perhaps it was Fricke’s idea to transform these perceptions and enlighten our psyche by showing us common occurrences on different ends of the spectrum. Take for example death. He shows an old man, his life and the color of his flesh muted by death. Scenes later, he shows what appears to be a dead newborn and then he shows a family grieving over a dead boy encased in a gun shaped coffin. Do we only associate death with the elderly? Maybe, this is Fricke attempts to change this questionable perception.
Maybe, Fricke’s message was specific—maybe, it was that all things begin and end and this cycle repeats itself endlessly. In the beginning of the film, we witness Tibetan monks creating a Thangka, which is an artwork that depicts the wheel of life. In order to create this particular Thangka, the monks had to tediously blow color sand grains through a small pipe. Once it was completed, the monks quickly reviewed it and then destroyed it. So, it is implied that they will do this again and again.
Despite its lack of a concrete and obvious message, many ideas were insinuated. Perhaps, this was Fricke’s point. If nothing else, “Samsara” forces you to think about the true meaning of life and living.
“Samsara,” which was shown in 2011 at the Toronto International Film Festival and in August 2012 in 60 theaters across the United States, is now available On Demand and on DVD.

Legend of Grimrock, an indie RPG (role-playing game) and a Dungeon crawler created by Almost Human Games, came out early last year. It’s a take on the classic dungeon adventure game where you have to navigate with a party of players and try to survive traps and monsters.
You start by picking four characters and creating their class (warrior, mage, rouge) and skills. The game is all about survival. If one of the characters dies, it’s dead for the rest of the game, unless you reload your game before he is killed. Players have to solve puzzles to escape, find weapons, and light torches to navigate and find food or your party will starve. The maze of stone walls and the creepy dark atmosphere is immersive and detailed with amazing graphics. You can find secret items and sometimes things that can really help you, including more food or armor, by looking for clues indicating where they could be.
The game was a lot of fun and you can replay it a lot with different party member configurations. Players can create maps and you create your own adventure and play others online. The only drawback is how the combat works. You have to click on the weapon in your party’s hand on the side of the screen over and over again, which is annoying. To use spells of one of your mages, you have to use the correct combination of runes on that party-member’s attack window, which is sometimes slow especially when you’re trying to kill a monster.
Overall it’s a great game and was one of the best games introduced last year. I give this personal favorite a 9/10. You can buy it at around $15 on Steam and on other PC game markets.

Remember when we feared the living dead back in the 1960’s George A. Romero created a film that instilled a fear in the American movie watching public that would ring through decades of good and bad zombie movies. I am referring to the ever classic “Night of the Living Dead.” Fast forward nearly fifty years and we have the romantic, cute, and pretty funny “Warm Bodies” directed by Jonathan Levine. Being a huge fan of the zombie culture, I had to check this movie out.
The movie opens up with our protagonist undead hero, simply called “R” (Nicholas Hoult), wandering around an abandoned airport. The audience learns that R wants more out of life than he is given even though he is undead. We also see that R has a buddy named “M” (Rob Corddry) and they communicate through grunts and moans, even getting an occasional word out.
Eventually, R encounters his love interest, “Julie” (Teresa Palmer), and vows to protect her from the hungry zombies and “bonies” without getting the urge to devour her flesh. The movie blatantly refers to the timeless love of Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” with both main character’s names having twists on the classic protagonist’s. Not only that, but Julie’s father, Colonel Grigio (John Malkovich), tries to tear their love apart. Well, can you blame him? His daughter fell in love with a living corpse.
Zombies can also relive memories of the dead after consuming their brains (Yes! Finally a real zombie characteristic!). However, it has more of a sentimental value because the undead can no longer dream or sleep. This allows R to experience Julie in a whole new light, because he kills then eats her deceased ex-boyfriend. How charming!
Forbidden love is what keeps life interesting and with Valentine’s Day coming up, “Warm Bodies” makes for an adorable romantic comedy for couples of nerdy and zombie obsessed alike. While I will say Nicholas Hoult is quite the British cutie, I will be frank: the acting in this movie is bland. The jokes are funny when delivered, but most of the film consists of watching the human and un-human connect on a borderline “Stockholm Syndrome” level which is creepy. It’s like watching “Beauty and the Beast” when you’re older and realizing that Belle fell in love with a monster both literally and metaphorically.
While movies like “Twilight” and “The Notebook” have sappy qualities and engaging romances, R and Julie’s quest for true love is actually optimistic. You feel good about the two of them ending up together, rather than having a half-hearted “yippee” at the end of the movie. I would say if you have nothing better to do on V-day than to go watch movies and know that your loved one may eat you one day, then “Warm Bodies” should be on your to-do list.

Aside from the President, the Secretary of Defense is the most powerful civilian official in the U.S. military. Departing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who will leave office in early 2013, has overseen a number of great changes in the U.S. armed forces during his time in office.
Notable among these are the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 2012 in order to allow openly gay service members, as well as the decision made in 2013 by the Pentagon to allow female soldiers to serve in combat. When asked whether fostering such diversity in the military should be a top priority for the Pentagon, Ray Bullock, a senior Political Science major, believes that these changes in our armed forces “wouldn’t make a difference” as far as he is concerned, illustrating to some extent how issues which previously aroused great public sentiment now have become much less contentious, to say the least.
However, as much as one may examine Panetta’s record, it is also important to note that before 2008 he was a strong critic of the military interventionism undertaken by President George W. Bush as well as the torture practices carried out by government branches such as the C.I.A. during Bush’s tenure. Nevertheless, Panetta subsequently served as Director of C.I.A. for President Bush’s successor. During his time in these positions the U.S. not only continued the military interventionism started during President Bush’s administration, it actually increased its military operations into countries such as Libya, Yemen, and Somalia, to name a few. It is troubling, to say the least, that Panetta would criticize such war-mongering while a republican was a President, yet be in charge of it when a member of his own party is in the White House. Did all his concerns about U.S. war-mongering and torture disappear simply disappear because a President from his own political party was elected? In this respect it seems as if Panetta’s term in office saw him pay more attention to increasing gender diversity in the military and making homosexuals feel welcome.
Maria Simone Otterlei, a junior Communications major, believes that while the Pentagon should “encourage” such things, it should have “greater priorities” such as, in one’s own opinion, ending pointless American military intervention in the Middle East. Then again, perhaps Secretary Panetta might issue a regulation before he retires in February, 2013, which states that combat positions may only be undertaken by homosexual or female service members. Of course, such a policy would mean the U.S. would then have to curtail much of its military adventurism because women and homosexuals comprise only a fraction of service members, but then again, curtailing our military interventionism was what Panetta believed to begin with.

According to the media, Valentine’s Day is a day when it is socially acceptable for couples to participate in public displays of affection, buy flowers, chocolates and stuffed animals; simply because that is what the day calls for. Based on history, there were at least eight actual Saint Valentine’s, none of which actually specialized in the act of “love.” The only common quality among all of them was that all eight were outstanding lovers of God and people, able to hear and to support anyone in love.
For years, the media has manipulated everyone into believing Valentine’s Day is only for people in love with a significant other. People are under the pressure of society to out-do the previous year and buy mushy cards and pay for an extravagant dinner in the middle of the week for no real reason. However, if viewed historically, Valentine’s Day is for anyone who loves a higher power, family member, friend or pet!
Students on campus view the age old holiday through different lenses. Amanda Einemann, a freshman Theatre major, is in a long-term relationship and cannot wait for Valentine’s Day. “To me Valentine’s Day is the sweetest holiday! Everyone becomes so open about their feelings and spoils each other. I think it’s so cute and I love it,” Einemann said. Angela Celentano is a newly single freshman that has a more realistic view of the wretched media frenzy. “Valentine’s Day is overrated. I actually cannot wait for it to be the week after so I can finally stop hearing about couples’ plans and falsified happiness,” Celentano chuckled. When asked about the flaws in this holiday, both girls agree that people should be encouraged to display their emotions on a more regular basis, versus one day out of the year.
Valentine’s Day is a day when couples pretend that nothing is wrong in the world and being with each other is the best thing since sliced bread. This holiday has been built up by card companies and chocolate factories to sell an abundance of supplies at a hiked up price; and they get away with it! The public allows this to happen year after year! This is one of the biggest days for restaurants as well. Their attempt to fool everyone into thinking there are truly “Valentine’s Day specials” is absurd! However this is a common reoccurrence. In fact, Valentine’s Day is an overrated holiday concocted by the media to manipulate the public to conform to the hype. This year, will you be sitting at a restaurant paying outrageous prices or will you be doing something different, laughing at all of those gullible enough on the 14t?

Spring break can be considered the rite of passage for every college student. For many it is the highlight of the spring semester-or even their whole college experience. Every year millions of young college students travel to destination spots to enjoy a week on the beach and plenty of alcohol.
Many students plan spring break well in advance. “I am going to Hawaii for spring break with my friends, and my girlfriend…Well hopefully my girlfriend,” said Sang Geun Yoon, a senior Journalism major, “I’ve saved up money and have been looking forward to spring break since the day school started.” For those students that do not yet know where to start planning their spring break getaway, do not lose hope. The website studentcity.com can be used to plan college students’ spring break trip. The website informs about the hottest spring break spots, finds the best flight and hotel deals, and provides tons of general information about spring break week.
The top destinations for college students on a budget include Daytona Beach, Florida; Panama City Beach, Florida; Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; and of course Cancun, Mexico. The beaches of Florida, like Daytona and Panama City, attract tons of students who road-trip to spring break together, splitting the cost of gas and cramming 20 kids into a hotel room meant for two. Going to Puerto Vallarta or Cancun in Mexico can be more expensive because of travel accommodations. The spring break destinations have all-inclusive resorts and cheap chain-hotels where students can spend the week. For decades, college students have flocked to these spring break destinations in packs to spend the days on drop-dead gorgeous beaches and, of course, to enjoy crazy nightlife.
Even if your spring break does not include traveling with friends, there are still many options to keep you busy during the week off. In fact, many college students choose to have an “alternative” spring break and volunteer their time to help others. For those who want to get more out of their spring break then hangovers and hookups, volunteering can be a life-enriching experience that also looks great on a resume. Students can use websites such as volunteermatch.com that help find local volunteer projects by simply logging in and entering your zip code. Other options can be to volunteer abroad so you still get the experience of going to a new place. The organization Projects Abroad has special short-term programs meant for students to do during their breaks. Students can find more information by visiting projects-abroad.org. Talia Charlton, a junior Journalism major said, “I am trying to save enough money to visit my friends that study abroad in London, but if that doesn’t work out I might decide to volunteer at some local places.” Doing something productive during spring break is an appealing option to many. LIU Post students and athletes participate in many volunteer projects throughout the year. The Department of Student Life and Services can guide you to different volunteer opportunities. The department is located in the Winnick House, Room 200 and the phone number is (516) 299-2255.
Spring break can also be a great time to catch up with friends and get ahead and start searching for summer jobs and internships. Or maybe just sit home and catch up on those television programs you have not had time to watch all semester.
After spending countless nights crammed with homework and overwhelmed by work and classes, spring break is a time to choose how you want to spend your week; at the beach, volunteering, or even laying in bed.

On the 15th of February, the Romans used to have a commemoration where their soldiers got to choose a woman to spend the next twelve months with prior to battle. Many of these pairs fell in love, and sought to marry. The soldiers no longer wanted to head off to battle, for they had found their soul mates and wished to be with them. The emperor, infuriated by this turn of events, set out to ban all soldiers from marriage. The church diverged, disregarded the emperor’s wishes, and married the couples in spite of him; the priests responsible were arrested, some were even sentenced to death.
There are a number of legends regarding this tale. One suggests that a priest named Valentine had been martyred for helping people escape the bleak, harsh Roman prisons that had them captured, beaten and tortured. Valentine was in love with the jailer’s daughter and he wrote her a letter of love and devotion, prior to his execution. At the close of his letter, Valentine wrote, “Farewell from your Valentine.” He died on the 14th of February. Around 498 A.D., February 14 was declared to be Valentine’s Day; this was designed as a day for lovers to send each other valentines, just as the priest did, to express devotion.
Along with this day being significant for the noble priests death, France and England viewed February 14 as the beginning of birds’ mating season. This inclines the idea for romance and expressing love for one another on this day. Valentine’s Day, the well-known sweetheart “holiday”, encourages lovers (and secret admirers) to express kind acts of romance and endearment. Many people have their own individual views on what Valentine’s Day is about. Some believe this day signifies love, and distinguishes “very romantic” couples from those who are not. Some have their own outlooks on the day.
Today, Valentine’s Day is treated as an opportunity for couples to send chocolate, flowers, and “valentines”(love letters) to one another, proclaiming their love. The real “mushy” couples will go out on dates, and spend the day together. Couples who are temporarily “long distance”, like military couples or couples separated at different schools, are often sad because they can’t be with each other to celebrate this special day together. Then, there are the couples that don’t believe they need a day to show their significant other that they love them, because it’s something that should be seen all the time. Apart from the various behaviors of couples on Valentine’s Day, there are single individuals who want nothing to do with the day. These people are common, and are bitter and anti-Valentine’s Day due to relationship status or lack thereof. This common stance on Valentine’s Day, for whatever their reasons may be, could be very stressful. Valentine’s Day was established upon pure love and devotion. Today, people have begun to misunderstand the meaning. All that seems to matter are physical, material items that they receive, and who gets more. Society has allowed superficial factors such as candies, flowers, expensive dinners and jewelry to bury the true meaning of Valentine’s Day.
To me, Valentine’s Day is what you make of it. It could be the worst day of the year, if you sit at home eating ice cream and watching The Notebook, and I don’t blame you for feeling anti-Valentine’s Day! If you gather the courage and ask that girl you’ve liked out, spend time with friends and family or others you love, or just treat it like any other day, then you understand the meaning of Valentine’s Day. It’s simply to love, and be loved. Reset your perspective, appreciate the opportunity you are given each year to entice the ones you love, and keep a smile on your face; even if you’re single on this day, there are a lot more days left in the year.
“Valentine’s Day is all about being with who or what you love, whether your friends, your boyfriend/girlfriend, or even with a box of chocolate in your room watching Lifetime movies!” said Hailey Mickulas, a freshman Journalism major. “Happy Valentine’s Day and do what makes you smile!” As Valentine had said, farewell, and keep the spirit of Valentine’s Day positive!

For a second time this semester, the campus Office of Public Safety has advised the Pioneer that crime information from mid-November through mid-January is not available. The Pioneer is unaware, therefore, whether any crime information exists for that time period. However, the Pioneer is aware that Public Safety has not made publicly available any information about the theft of the Pioneer layout computers, which the Pioneer reported to Public Safety in early January.
• On January 19, 2013, three students in Riggs Hall were caught smoking marijuana. Although they admitted to having marijuana, they were not arrested or interviewed.
• On January 22, a student gave his guest the code to enter Queens Hall. The guest was escorted off campus and Public Safety ensured the code was changed.
• On January 25, an illegally parked car was hit in the Nassau Hall parking lot.
• On February 1, the RA entered a room and saw two residents smoking marijuana. The residents also had guests in their room. They admitted to smoking the substance, and the guests were asked to leave. The marijuana was confiscated by Public Safety.

LIU Post has been certified as silver by Out of Work for its resources to help lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual students (LGBT). Out of Work is an organization that strives to help the LGBT community gain equality in the work force.
Out of Work surveys participating colleges and universities by looking at areas such as connecting LGBT current students with alumni, keeping current with issues in the workforce concerning the LGBT community and having the career center staff training other staff at the university on LGBT issues.
There are 17 sections and depending on how many of the components are successfully completed, the university becomes certified as gold, silver or bronze. One reason that Post is not gold is that the university did not actually help any LGBT students yet, despite the fact that they had a workshop in the past which no students attended, according to Jason Cascone, director of Career Development.
“Our biggest problem is that we are not a required place to go,” said Cascone.
Some students claim that they have not taken advantage of Career Services, which also offers other resources such as building resumes, helping students figure out what major best suits them, finding internships and jobs and prepping for job interviews, because they do not know much about it.
“I don’t know how to make an appointment,” said Megan Kolakowski, sophomore Dance major. She saw an advertisement for Career Services on a bulletin board once but said she never had time to go down and look for an internship.
Her friend, Paige Ketsoglou, also a sophomore Dance major, added that she has never even heard of Career Services.
The two-year-old initiative, called Safe at Post, was enacted to better assist LGBT students find careers. Career councilors and academic advisors who work in Career Services, located on the second floor of Kumble Hall, have gone through training for the Safe at Post program. The training was designed to make the advisors and councilors aware of LGBT issues to enable them to better serve the population with counseling, according to Cascone.
Safe at Post has not been publicized yet. The program was inspired by SafeZone, a national organization that helps make it possible for gays to enjoy their full civil rights.
Along with the new program, Career Services is also creating a decal to brand its program, which has not been released yet. The decal is going to be a rainbow triangle with the words, “Safe at Post.” Cascone hopes that this will help make Post more LGBT friendly.
The Career Center offers pamphlets that provide tips for resume writing and interviews. There is also information on the Career Services portion of LIU Post’s website about jobs and employers that are LGBT friendly. These were some of the aspects of the Career Center that influenced Out of Work to certify Post as silver.
According to Cascone, the current issue with the LGBT program at Post is the disconnect between the program and the students. He believes that once Post can prove that students are actually participating and being helped the university can become certified as gold.
Cascone said that many plans are set for this initiative. The only thing that is currently standing in the way is getting students to participate in the program. He plans to get the attention of students by working with Rainbow Alliance, another organization dedicated to the equality for people including the LGBT community, and by using social media outlets.
“Anybody who is looking for a place to go and talk and feel that they can feel good about will know that they can walk into that office and a person is ready to speak to you.”
For more information on how Post is serving the LGBT community, visit www.liu.edu/CWPost/StudentLife/CareerSrv, call (516) 299-2251 or visit Career Services on the second floor of Kumble Hall. The office is open Monday through Thursday between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. and Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.

A new chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists has been formed at LIU Post this semester. By joining, journalism majors and other interested students can grow valuable future contacts, attend career-inspiring events and possibly obtain scholarships.
“SPJ offers chances for students to have experiences that are hard to bring to the classroom,” said Sandra Mardenfeld, director of Post’s Journalism program.
The Society of Professional Journalists was founded as a non-profit organization in 1909 in Indiana. It was initiated as the fraternity Sigma Delta Chi. The aim was to promote and improve ethical journalism while protecting journalistic work according to first amendment rights regarding freedom of press and speech.
Today, being a member can be highly beneficial to anyone considering a career within print or online journalism, television or radio broadcasting or simply to anyone interested in a career that involves writing. At Post, you do not have to be a Media Arts student to join SPJ.
“Anyone from any major at the university can join our chapter,” said Lauren Thomas, a Broadcasting major and president of SPJ at Post. “Not all of our members are Journalism majors,” she added.
Sandra Mardenfeld, media arts professor and director of the Journalism program, was a member of her student chapter, and recognizes the many advantages it gave her. “Being president of my student chapter at Buffalo State when I was at undergraduate level, gave me the possibility of professional networking before I was a professional. It gave me a few job interviews,” she said. “SPJ also offers scholarships to members, along with an opportunity to compete in a nationally recognized journalism award program,” she continued.
Networking with professionals and finding inspiration for the field comes from attending the many events and conferences that SPJ organizes annually. “We are currently planning to attend SPJ’s regional conference, that takes place at Rutger’s University in New Jersey this year,” Thomas said. “There will be great future contacts attending the conference, who can help you later when looking for jobs after college.”
Post’s new chapter is also planning a few events of its own this semester. Kristiane Aateigen, an international Journalism student, is content to have joined SPJ. “In March, we have scheduled a trip to the New York Times building, and in April, some of us are going to the David Letterman show,” she said. “To get a tour at the Times and sit in the audience at a live taping of Letterman are amazing opportunities. Both the newspaper and the show are famous and well-recognized all over the world,” she added.
To become a member, one has to pay the initial membership charge of $37.50, and the chapter’s dues are $10 per semester. The dues are worth the price, since they help sponsor events such as school trips, other events and conferences. After entering the organization, members are expected to attend meetings held once a month to plan future events, discuss fundraising and outreach and more.
Apart from the officers, consisting of a president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer, there are several positions and tasks to handle within SPJ. “While some are responsible for fundraising, others are event-planners, and some are involved with PR. For example, the ones responsible for PR are currently working on setting up a Twitter account,” said Potoula Anagnostakos, a Journalism major and vice-president of SPJ. “There is something for everyone to do and it will also look good on your resume,” she added.
Members of SPJ at Post can continue their membership until graduation, but the journey does not have to end there. One can still stay a member after college and retain access to the website, which provides a list of events, scholarships and awards to apply for or attend. For prospective media art careers, joining SPJ will be an advantageous boost.
SPJ’s next meeting is February 28 at 12:30 p.m. in the Media Arts lab located in Humanities Hall.
