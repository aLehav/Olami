“Peter/Piper” is a production hitting the stage for the first time with the Post Theater Company (PTC). The play, written by Trista Baldwin, a playwright and co-founder of Workhaus Playwrights’ Collective, tells the story of two sisters, Piper and Claire, who face a family tragedy and experience grief down two very different paths.
The story shows how people move on after tragedy and how we, as a society, can do better grieving or allowing space for people to not be okay.
Piper and Claire are just starting their lives; one is a college student and one just got engaged. Then tragedy strikes their family. Their lives are altered and they both react in different ways. Piper tries to escape through work, sex, and drinking. Claire tries to hold on too hard to the past.
Beth Lambert, a sophomore musical theatre major, plays Piper, who runs away to start over in NYC. “I connect with Piper about the need to constantly keep looking for more and more,” Lambert said. “She starts off with the life she wants and is comfortable, but you get one thing and you just want to take it further. She’s looking for a new story, love and life.”
“Peter/Piper” was originally commissioned by the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minn. Baldwin was asked to write the play for the theater’s class of 2014 B.F.A. actor training program. The original script was shorter. At Post, Baldwin has the liberty to extend the length of the show. This draft of the play is the first to be performed.
Baldwin is still making a few changes, either removing or adding scenes as the rehearsal process moves on. Yet the cast members do not let that phase their performances. The cast members are versatile to any changes that come their way, taking their direction well and committing to the truth of the characters they are portraying. “It is very fun to be hearing the changes in rehearsal right after I wrote them,” Baldwin said.
Lambert said that working with the playwright is a good challenge. “I never did a new work where you are constantly getting new lines and new pages. It’s fun to explore the nooks and crannies that may have not been in the previous copy. It’s a lot of working on your feet and being ready for anything,” she said.
Lucy Sanci, a sophomore musical theatre major, plays Claire, who returns home and tries to relive past experiences.
“Claire is very independent, but still loves her friends and family,” Sanci said. When the tragedy hit her family, Claire wants to understand every angle of it and why it happened. “It’s her way of controlling the situation,” she said. Sanci connects to Claire’s character. “I’d do anything for my family and [want to be] able to support them,” she said.
Sanci also enjoys working alongside Baldwin in the rehearsal process. “It’s an amazing experience, especially so early on in my career, getting to work with Trista as the play is developed,” she said. Sanci and her castmates have the opportunity to lend a hand in the progress of the show, rather than working with a predetermined set of characters. “You get to have a say with what the character is like,” she said.
Though it is not a musical, choreography is a huge factor in “Peter/Piper.” The cast uses contemporary dance and movement as well as poetic language to tell a story. The movement, according to Baldwin, creates an experience of the surreal state of mind post state-of-shock, which represents the narrative. “It’s more of an experiential play, rather than a linear narrative,” Baldwin said. The movement is not explicit, as the cast are responding to the script. “There is a physical language in addition to the verbal language,” she said.
“For Claire, the movement is a form of categorizing stuff,” Sanci said. “[Her movement] is very specific, she’s searching for something. She’s really trying to find an answer and put things in list.” Claire wants to feel what it is like to be present in the moment and is “grounding herself in her reality when everything can feel so up in the air,” Sanci said.
The play is inspired by Baldwin’s own personal experiences with loss, and friends’ experiences with loss. She looked at society and how it deals with loss, especially of young people. “I was given three days off work when a family member died,” Baldwin said. “Everything was all processed and afterwards everyone was like, ‘Yeah okay, move on,’ and that’s not how tragedy works.”
Baldwin was glad for the play to be performed by an ensemble, where some lines are spoken in unison, and the scenes are primarily interactive to better represent the dynamics within a society. This is different from the classic, spotlight monologues or two person scenes usually in plays. There are scenes playing out in the background of the narrative, creating a sense of community and togetherness.
“Trista’s done an excellent job in delving into the psychology of how people grieve,” Sanci said. “People from all walks of life can deal with the same circumstance. Though we feel alone, we don’t grieve alone. We are experiencing it together.”
Baldwin’s second inspiration came from the lack of roles for young women in plays. As a professor of playwriting, screenwriting, and dramatic literature at St. Cloud University, she witnessed the inequality. “I watched men and women audition and always noticed that the men look better, as the material is better suited for them,” she said.
The three males in the eight person cast all interact with the grief, as well as the women. The story, Baldwin says, shows how grief impacts the community, not just the sisters.
Lambert is happy to be working with a smaller cast. “We have grown a lot closer and have put our all into this. It’s great to work with people who are really dedicated,” she said.
Mia Rovegno, a Brooklyn-based director, playwright and puppeteer, was hired by PTC to direct the play. While Baldwin is on set to make a few changes to the script, Rovegno also contributes by helping the cast members figure out their movements.
“Mia does a great job working with us, not at us,” Sanci said. “Working with an all-female creative team is an amazing experience,” she added.
“Peter/Piper” will be performed on Feb. 16, 17, 23, and 24 at 7:30 p.m., and Feb. 18 and 25 at 3 p.m. in the LIU Post Riffle Range Theatre. Tickets are $15 for general admission, $12 for seniors, and $10 for students who show valid ID. Tickets are available online at www.tix55.com/ptc700, or by calling the box office at 516-299-2356.

The new dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS), Nathaniel Bowditch, hired on August 11, 2017, is now in his second semester at LIU Post.
Bowditch has adjusted well to the new setting. “The best thing about LIU Post is the people; everyone is really helpful, generous and friendly,” he said. Bowditch wants to build a connection with the students, and his first step is by teaching his own class. “I want to know our students; that’s who we are serving and why we are here,” he said.
Bowditch is joined by his wife, Eden, who joined the university as an adjunct professor in the English department beginning this academic year. The CLAS long time secretary, Joan Ruckel, has also left the university this semester.
Bowditch, who was previously the dean of the school of humanities and social sciences at the American University in Cairo, is bringing some changes to CLAS. However, he doesn’t want to make changes just for the sake of making them. He wants to “identify a problem if there is one, and figure out a way for everyone to benefit from the changes.”
One of the changes being discussed is the merger of academic departments.
Several departments in the college may be consolidated, according to Bowditch. “We are thinking of consolidating, however nothing is finalized.” By merging departments together, the school has potential to grow, according to Bowditch.
At the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year, CLAS chairs were informed about the potential merger of their departments. Faculty members did not agree with the proposal. On Jan. 31, the faculty members of CLAS unanimously approved to present a two page document titled, “Faculty Resolution Opposing CLAS Consolidation” to the Faculty Council. In this document, the faculty expressed their concerns over the plan to consolidate 12 departments, and stated that “the administration has not demonstrated that it values the liberal arts and sciences or is committed to their survival,” and that “consolidation likely will result in fewer majors and minors, more frustrations for our students, and lower retention rates in the college.”
Not all faculty members oppose the department mergers. Sheila Gunther, a professor in the foreign language department, understands the necessity of the consolidation plan to bring the university to the twenty-first century. “This is not inherently bad and should ultimately make the university more cost efficient and stable,” she said.
“We should be asking ‘Are we structured in the best way we could be’,” Bowditch said. Bowditch and the CLAS faculty want to make sure that their programs are set up best for students, and organized well. “The idea is to make sure we have excellent programs, we are organized in the right way, we are offering what students want, are the departments set up in a way that is maximally productive for faculty to be collaborating with each other and working together,” he said.
The chairs of the English and philosophy departments have expressed a willingness to merge, yet nothing is finalized, according to Amy Freedman, chair of the political science department. “If consolidations are mandated, I have every reason to assume that political science will be merged with one or two additional departments. It is too soon to know what this will look like and how it will play out,” Freedman said.
This idea to consolidate departments comes shortly after the development of a new core-curriculum put together by the Thematic Core Curriculum committee, previously discussed in the article “Core Curriculum To Be Reduced” by Anand Venigalla in the Dec. 6 issue of The Pioneer. It also comes at a time when the administration has yet to honor their commitment to answer the serious charges raised in the faculty’s June 2017 report to the New York State Education Department (NYSED). This idea also comes before most departments have completed Academic Program Reviews, which faculty state in the document, “demonstrate that the only metric that counts is enrollment.”
A decision is yet to be made, and Bowditch and the CLAS faculty will continue to meet and discuss to ensure that “they are giving the students the best that we can.”

Fashion merchandising students will be traveling to Paris from March 9 to 16 to study the fashion roots of Paris, France. “Paris is the epicenter of fashion. It’s the perfect place for us to begin this journey,” Professor Cherie Serota, director of the fashion merchandising program, said. There are currently eight students going to Paris and there are more students in the process of registering. Students will leave in the evening on March 9 on an Air France flight. The trip is open to students of all majors.
The goal of this trip is to allow students to visit Paris and learn a different culture through the eyes of fashion and business. “I as well as other faculty and persons from College Tours (the company that the fashion and merchandising program), has partnered with students to experience a different culture and see what a different culture brings to us by looking at things in a global universe,” Serota said. Students will study culture, music, art, fashion, business, and will collaborate with Parisian students to see how they work.
On the first full day of the trip, students will go on a walking tour in Paris to visit Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Seine River, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Palace, the Palais Garnier (opera house), and the Palais Galliera. Dinner will be in the Latin Quarter and St.Michel.
While in Paris, the students will get hands on experience during a fashion exchange with the students at the Fashion Institute of Paris. Also, scheduled during the trip are a historical walking tour of Paris which will allow students and faculty to see Paris through the lenses of fashion, a trip to the Nathalie Au store to learn how fabric is cut, and visits to numerous show-rooms, boutiques, and notable fashion sites will also be in students’ reach.
“We are going to do organized dinners while other times students will have time have time to go on their own and explore Paris,” Professor Serota said.
Students will earn one credit for a global studies course for participating in the trip. The students will complete an outcome assessment at the end of the trip with different objectives about the experience. Those that go on the Paris trip will learn the significance of global economy.
“You can start up a business in any country, there are no limitations with the internet, we are a global economy right now,” Serota said. Faculty will challenge students’ thinking by helping them think outside of their usual environment. Students will also be immersed in the Parisian culture, learning firsthand what it is like to live globally.
The fashion club will be holding several fundraisers for the trip throughout March to aid students going on the trip. Students interested in the trip can contact the financial aid office to learn more.
Serota believes that the best way to learn the history of fashion is by witnessing where fashion began. This trip offers knowledge that a textbook is not capable of offering. “Studying fashion is not just about learning through a book, it’s really about seeing, doing, feeling,” Serota said. There are textures, fabrics and showrooms that will become students’ classroom in a country that is responsible for the history of fashion.
The trip to Paris is the first trip the fashion merchandising program is sponsoring. Serota’s goal is to take students on a trip to a different country, every year, and offer more financial assistance. Some cities being considered for future trips are Milan, Florence, and Rome.
To learn more about the trip contact Serota at cherie.serota@liu.edu or EF College Study Tours at 877-485-4184 or EFCST. COM/2058349CD. There is still time left to make Paris your classroom!

The fashion merchandising program recently received a donation of new mannequins from Saks 5th Avenue, as well as a private donation of a collection of haute couture dresses to display on the new mannequins.
According to fashion merchandising professor Cherie Serota, the mannequins are made by an upscale mannequin vendor called Pucci, one of the most high-end mannequin companies, which is based out of New York City. The mannequins are called “Frankies,” and everything is produced in New York,” Serota said.
When asked if the program wanted the donation, Serota answered with an emphatic yes. “We took the LIU truck to the back door of the store before it opened and transported 25 mannequins back to the fashion hub of the library,” located in Library room 131.
Serota plans to use the mannequins for “various classes, such as visual merchandising, fashion forecasting, and others in the future.” She also said they will be used for a fashion exhibition at some point within the coming years.
The couture dresses, which were privately donated, will also be an asset to the fashion merchandising program. “This vintage collection includes designer gowns, dresses, and sportswear, with pieces by Haltson, Lanvin, Ungaro, Vicky Tiel, and Jaques Fath,” Serota said, explaining the importance of these legendary designers. “Fath is considered a dominant influence on post-war haute couture,” Serota said. “He showed his first collection in Paris in 1937.”
In addition to the new mannequins, Serota is excited for New York Fashion Week, which takes place from Thursday, Feb. 8 to Friday, Feb. 16. “We have students who will be backstage during the show,” Serota said.
Serota expects the collection of new clothes to be an “ongoing project within the fashion merchandising program, where we will display the collection on the newly acquired mannequins. We’re really excited for this opportunity.”
The fashion merchandising program, which was originally a part of the Department of Communications and Film in the College of Arts, Communications & Design, is now a part of the College of Management. Students can now receive a B.S. in Fashion Merchandising.

On Jan. 10, the I.T. department sent an email to the LIU Post community regarding two security vulnerabilities: Meltdown and Spectre. These bugs allow hackers to steal memory from commonly used computers and smartphones.
According to the New York Times, the program, Meltdown, can be fixed. However, “the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent — an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.”
There is no easy fix for Spectre, according to the New York Times. The easiest way to remove the spectre bug would be to redesign the processors.
Members of the I.T. department assured students that they are taking the necessary steps to keep their privacy protected. According to the email sent at the beginning of the semester, “Information Technology has already installed software to help mitigate these vulnerabilities on all LIU-owned computers and devices, as well as servers across the University.”
Albert Donor, a senior broadcasting major and Browse associate, was unaware of the bugs. Donor has not been keeping up with updates to his phone and computer, however, he will make an effort to keeping his software up to date. “I have seen the school keeping track of the computers. In the computer graphics lab, they hired a tech to wipe computers every night,” he said.
Ashley Damis, a sophomore broadcasting major, does not use the computers for personal use. “I’ve seen multiple students not logged out of personal information and worry what if I forget, someone can use my social media or something worse,” she said.
George Baroudi, LIU’s Vice President for Information Technology, did not respond to the Pioneer’s request for information about the security vulnerabilities.
In the email, they advise the community to “keep your software up-to-date. This includes your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android), your browser (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari), and your browser plug-ins.”

Rachel Szekely, the director of curriculum for non-native speakers (which plans the curriculum for international students in the first-year writing program) and associate professor of English, is currently the only professor at Post whose specialty is linguistics.
Szekely received a Ph.D. from the Graduate Center at the City University of New York and her undergraduate degree from Smith College. Her area of specialization is pragmatics and its interfaces with syntax, semantics and philosophy of language. She began teaching at LIU in the fall 2008 and is now teaching ENG2, (Writing II: Research and Argumentation), ENG3, (Grammar and Structure of English) and ENG787 (Introduction to Linguistics).
Her current project involves the subject of negation. “For the past few years I have been working on negation, specifically negative indefinites like ‘no man.’ I am trying to explain why it is that negative indefinites can be interpreted with contrary meaning (rather than contradictory meaning) in predicate position. For example, you can use the sentence ‘John is no fool’ to mean more than just that he is not a fool–to say that John is clever. I initially approached this problem semantically, trying to explain it by virtue of the meanings of the words and the way they are composed, but have recently begun to explore a pragmatic approach to this phenomenon. That means I’m looking at the way we use sentences that acquire these meanings and trying to explain these facts on that basis,” Szekely said.
Linguistics appeals to Szekely because of its no-nonsense approach. “Linguists pull no punches. I enjoy that frankness and the fact that there are real facts at issue,” Szekely said.
Linguistics also appeals to her because of the variety it offers interested learners. “From a curricular point of view, linguistics is also special, because it touches on so many other disciplines—languages, literature, sociology, philosophy, psychology, computer science and speech pathology, to name a few,” Szekely said.
Szekely loves languages. She is fluent in speaking and reading French, German and Italian. The history of language drew her to linguistics. “I always loved languages, but had only studied language in the context of literature—linguistics was a way to study language more analytically. There were facts to be discovered. This was exciting to me,” Szekely said.
Being the only linguistics professor on campus can be lonely for Szekely. “Most people have no idea what my field is. They think I can fix non-native speakers’ English or that I study writing. Neither of these is my [area] of expertise,” Szekely said.
For those who want to learn languages, Szekely has a simple piece of advice. “Go to the country where it is spoken, and live there. That’s the best thing you can do,” she said.
Szekely also gave some advice for translations. “No text is the same in translation, but translations can be works of art independently of that. There are translations that are interesting in their own right. But if you really want to know what someone has written, read it in the original. Or trust your translator.

Willie Hiatt, a latin american history professor who doubles as a street photographer, found public canoodling a common theme during his fall research semester in Lima, Peru. Since Peruvian youth tend to live at home longer than their U.S. contemporaries, amorous couples must find space for romance where they can—park benches, bus stops, street corners, public transportation, train stations. The soundtrack for these couples must have been Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You.” Happy Valentine’s Day and Feliz Día del Amor y la Amistad to lovesick couples everywhere!

Valentine’s Day can get pretty expensive. Here are some affordable ideas to make your special someone happy on a budget. The best thing to do if you’re not trying to break the bank is a DIY project.
Project 1: “I-Heart-U” Pop-Up Card
What you need:
3 sheets of di erent colored paper scissors
glue
a pencil
Directions:
Take the first paper and fold it in half horizontally. This is the card. With the second sheet of paper, cut out three thin strips and fold them accordion style. Test out the spring before gluing one end on the inside of the card.
With the last sheet of paper, write out the letter “I” and a “U” and cut them out. Make sure that they fit on the inside of the card. On that same colored sheet, cut out a heart shape.
Next, glue the pieces to the other end of the zigzag strips. Test the spring, so the letters and heart pop out.
Finally, decorate the rest of the card and personalize it so it makes the perfect gift.
Project 2: Chocolate Popcorn
What you need:
Popcorn (store bought is fine) Chocolate (for melting) Sprinkles (optional)
A medium microwaveable bowl
A large mixing bowl
Directions:
In a medium sized bowl, warm up some candy melts or chocolate in a microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring between each time until it is melted and creamy. If you want to match the theme, you can mix red food dye with white chocolate to turn it pink. Regular milk or dark chocolate works as well.
Pop the popcorn. Mix the popcorn and warm melted chocolate together. For some added decoration and crunch, mix some pink and red sprinkles into the mix, and voilà. Valentine’s Day popcorn.
Project #3: V-Day 3D Photo Cube
What you need:
a Rubik’s cube
a printed photo of you and your significant other
mod podge
a ruler
a pencil
scissors
Directions:
Print six copies of the photo and cut them to the same size as the Rubik’s cube. Apply any photo filters of your choice to distinguish the sides and make them stand out.
Next, place the photo on the Rubik’s cube to trace the lines of each individual cube on the photo (trace on the back of the picture to avoid ruining the photo). Use the ruler to ensure the lines are straight. Then cut the lines that you made on the photo.
After your pieces are cut take your Rubiks cube and apply mod podge on one side of the Rubik’s cube, applying to each of the six sides as you go. One by one, take the pieces of the picture and place them on the Rubik’s cube. Repeat the same process on the other five sides.
Once the mod podge has dried completely, apply another thin layer of mod podge on all six sides. Let it dry completely and evenly.

It is very easy to dislike a day dedicated to having a significant other if you don’t have one to share it with. I mean, who wants to see sappy love posts all over social media to remind you that you’re alone, right? Well I think it’s time to embrace the fact that you don’t need to be in a relationship with someone to enjoy Valentine’s Day.
For those who feel as though this day excludes you from all activities, you can change that. Find your single friends and make a fun day out of it. There are so many things you can do and still enjoy the day. You can go to the movies, make dinner at home with your friends, or stay in and binge watch a TV show with them. You can even get each other gifts to show how much their friendship means to you and make a fun night out of it. Single girls have recently even made up a new term called, ‘Galentine’s Day,’ which is a day they celebrate with their girlfriends so they all don’t feel alone.
Finding a way to be happy on a day like Valentines when you might feel alone can be rewarding. You don’t have to feel sad when you can stay positive. Tell the ones around you how much they mean to you and how much you love them. Use Valentine’s Day as a way to spread love to those around you. There is no reason for this holiday to ruin your mood, look for the positives and create your own happiness.

Necessary Materials: 
Multi-colored construction paper Scissors
Hole puncher
Twine, string, or wire Pencil
Tape
Marker
For those who are single and still searching for a way to celebrate Valentine’s Day, this quick and easy do-it-yourself heart decor is the perfect touch for any dorm room. First, take multiple pieces of construction paper and sketch or trace a heart onto them. Cut the hearts out, ensuring each is similar in size to the rest. For faster crafting, stack about three pages, fold them in half, trace half a heart shape onto the top page, and cut along the line. Unfold to reveal several symmetrical hearts.
With a pencil, lightly write any saying or word desired on the hearts, such as “single 4 eva,” “cupid is stupid,” or “nope.” Trace these words using a marker. Depending on the color of paper, different colors can be used to outline the phrases. Next, punch two holes into each heart in the top corners. String twine through the holes, and then use tape to hang on a wall, or tie the string around a bed frame.

A trip to the other side of the globe may create astounding memories and life-changing experiences. Hyon Hartberger, MFA student, found her muse in the landscapes of her home country, South Korea. Her series, “Evolution,” hung in the Student Art League Gallery from Feb. 6 to Feb. 10 and showcased vivid depictions of abstract mountains and creatures dwelling within them. “I chose to title my series that to show the culmination of my time here at LIU as a MFA student. I feel like I’ve truly evolved and grown so much,” Hyon said.
Inspiration struck Hyon Hartberger as she spent the summer abroad in Korea. After visiting the Busan Art Fair, she decided to broaden her work by changing up her art style. “If you were to see works from her past compared to now, it’s completely different, and you would think it’s a different artist,” her daughter, Naomi Hartberger, said. Each acrylic painting in Hyon’s collection is meant to be interpreted as a narrative, similarly to a diary entry. “In each piece, she left behind certain memories or certain thoughts,” Naomi said. Some paintings depict small chapels hidden in corners, others contain small birds meant to represent the artist herself within the piece.
Throughout her career as an artist, Hyon has used owls in her pieces, and they are a recurring motif in this exhibition. “The owl symbolizes a lot to do with the family in Korean traditions,” Naomi said, “So she wanted to symbolize how anywhere you go can become a home.” The paintings along the walls of the gallery displayed carefully outlined pairs of eyes in varying sizes accompanied by an owl’s feathers and beak. “She wants the eyes to symbolize how she views the world and how she looks on as other people make certain decisions [while] she’s timid and shy.” Naomi said Hyon has trained in traditional Korean calligraphy, for 32 years and is considered a master calligrapher and a member of the Korean Fine Arts Association. This style of painting is visible in the way she created the mountains depicted in her series. “Now that she’s transitioning from ink to acrylic, I guess that’s her way of bridging the gap,” Naomi said. Hyon’s paintings also include marble powder to add texture to the landscapes, “I feel like it adds another layer to her pieces,” Naomi said.
Upon returning to the U.S., Hyon used the art studios on campus every day to develop her “Evolution” series, and starting was the most difficult part of the process. After two weeks of deciding and even giving up at one point, she began with connecting owls to people and other elements of nature. She was excited and found freedom in delving into a different art style. “Every semester I did a different style, but [they looked] similar,” she said. Discouragement did not keep Hyon from creating a series that is unlike any of her previous artwork, many of which displayed horizons or grayscale images of clouds. The bright orange and yellow colors used in the paintings show Hyon’s bright and joyful personality, according to her daughter. Hyon describes the colors as calm and comfortable, like sunlight, and she has experienced profound emotions by connecting with the outdoors. The depiction of trees, wildlife and mountainous landscapes reflect Hyon’s infatuation with nature and how people interact with it. The owls in the paintings live alongside people, trees and owers. “They’re living like us,” she said. “Evolution” is a series of contemporary abstract work.

In 2007, Justin Timberlake released the album, “FutureSex/Love- Sounds.” The Grammy-nominated album featured well-known songs such as “SexyBack,” “My Love,” and “Love Stoned.” During March 2013, Timberlake released his album, “ The 20/20 Experience” and won awards including the Billboard Music Award for best R&B Album.

In early February, the former member of NSYNC, a boy band that was popular in the ‘90s and early 2000s, released his new album, “Man of The Woods.”
“Man of The Woods” features 16 songs. Timberlake posted a video on Instagram and explained the meaning behind the album’s title. His two-year-old son is named Silas which translates to “Man of The Woods” in Latin. Timberlake also mentioned on the Instagram video that the album was not a country soundtrack, but despite him saying this, some songs do sound similar to those in the country music genre. But, some of the songs are called, “Flannel,” “Montana,” and “Living off the Land.” The album name is cool and has an interesting, but does the music compare?
“Man of The Woods” was a giant disappointment, or maybe it seems so because “FutureSex/LoveSounds” was so good. In the album, “FutureSex/LoveSounds,” the main theme was about romance with the songs “SexyBack,” “Love Stoned” and “Summer Love.”
The first song of the new album, “Filthy” is not balanced well with the synthesized noise that plays through the entire song with the lyrics talking about his swagger. It was difficult to understand the structure of the song since it contains brief guitar solos and dubstep afterwards. The song, “Man of The Woods,” is also unbalanced; it sounds like Timberlake is whispering the entire song, and increasing the volume through earphones can be dangerous because the ampli cation of the song varies so greatly.
While Timberlake is a widely-admired musician, “Man of The Woods” is a complete mess. He should stick with the kind of music he made on “FutureSex/LoveSounds” instead of trying to incorporate different genres of music into one album. The album can be listened to through most music streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music.

Eugene Feigin, an adjunct professor of music since 2002, and his sister Tatiana Feigin have been playing musical instruments from the age of seven. The siblings share their musical talents annually in the Great Hall with a recital for students, faculty and the general public.
On Feb. 6, they performed “Piano Sonata” by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and “Sonatina” by Antonin Dvorak on the violin and piano.
Born and raised in Russia, Eugene earned both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from a state conservatory in Russia and appeared onstage, in films and on radio where he was able to perform for the world. He shares his love and dedication for the piano by teaching undergraduate and graduate students. “If you have talent, display that talent, I believe you can have a positive effect on people through music,” he said. He believes that music is the most important part of human experience, and is a huge supplement to every art, whether it be movies or shows.
Tatiana Feigin taught at conservatories in Westchester and Rockland County since 2003. She has played as a freelance musician in performances including: “The Feigin Duo Show” with her brother on campus, in orchestras and on WQXR radio. “I believe music connects you on different levels and I truly I love what I do,” she said.
Fredrik Stanghov, an international graduate student majoring in music composition, attended the performance on Feb. 6. The recitals are important for students to attend because they can inspire students to learn from professors who are successful in their careers in the music industry, according to Stanghov. “I’m fortunate to be a student at LIU Post…surrounded by an array of professional performers that provide me with the skills needed in this business,” he said. After graduation, he hopes to travel to Los Angeles, California and become a film composer.
Sarah Bogen, a junior instrumental performance major, also attended the performance. She plays the violin, viola and piano and hopes to be a performer. She gained inspiration and knowledge by watching her professors perform exactly how she hopes to one day.
“[The performance] was inspiring for students to keep performing and follow their career choices, even if it seems intimidating,” Vincent Basileo, a sophomore instrumental performance major, said.

The spring sports training season is in full swing and so is the wider athletic community. On Feb. 5, the Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) had its first meeting of the semester. What is SAAC and what do they do? It is a campus committee of a nationwide body of student athletes who discuss issues they face both on a college, regional and national level. Each sports team has two or three representatives on the committee who gather once a month to communicate their concerns with the athletic community to coaches, trustees, administrations and professor, as well as discussing the ways in which the student athletes can be role models. The SAAC committee is made up of volunteer athletes, most of which remain on the committee for the duration of their time at Post. The representatives on the committee also attend weekend seminars in order to be more informed about the athletics conference and regions.
Junior philosophy major John Dehler is a representative for the baseball team. “We determine what the best course of action is for student athletes,” Dehler said about the role of the SAAC athletes. “We work on how to make the athletic community better.”
One way in which student athletes help the community is with their involvement in the Make-A-Wish foundation, where the SAAC athlete encourage their teammates to help fundraise for the cause. This foundation uses the money donated to help grant a terminally ill child’s last wish. So far this year, the athletes at Post have raised $951 for the foundation. By selling the Make-A-Wish stars that now decorate the Pratt Recreation Center and wrist-bands, the student athletes are only $549 shy of their end of semester goal of $1500, and are coming up with other fundraising ideas to help achieve this. An idea that was discussed was a possible Chipotle fundraiser. This involves bringing one of the printed fliers to Chipotle and them giving a small percent of the cost as proceeds to the Make-A-Wish foundation. Although not finalized this has proved to be a fun and fast way of making more money for the charity. “I’ve collected cash and loose change around Hillwood Commons,” Dehler said about his efforts to raise money. “We fundraise as much money as we can to help someone’s wish come true!” he added.
During the spring semester, SAAC representatives will be meeting with the new athletic director, Debbie DeJong, on a monthly basis following the SAAC meetings. The SAAC athletes wanted to create a line of communication between the student athletes and administration, which is often lost with the busy schedules of both the athletes and the administration. “When there is a problem it doesn’t always get to the right people,” Dehler said.
He discussed how the student athletes want to work on improving the varsity weight room, as there is not enough weights or space for the number of athletes that use it. SAAC believes this renovation will help the athletes reach their full potential. Junior criminal justice and forensic science major Rachel Londot is one of the volleyball team’s three representatives on SAAC. She agrees with Dehler about establishing a relationship with DeJong. “It is to develop a good relationship with her and to better communicate issues concerning athletes,”she said. “I think these meeting will help athletes gain a stronger voice on campus and have a better chance of getting and seeing the changes they bring up and want.”
SAAC will also play an active role in the Student Government Association, there will be a regular representation, unlike this past year when a SAAC representative only attended on occasion. Two members of SAAC will attend SGA meetings to project the athletic voice to the wider school community. This responsibility will be shared among all SAAC representatives, as each sport must be present for one meeting in the spring semester, according to the SAAC representatives themselves who thought having each sport attend is the fairest and most responsible way to organize it. “Having SAAC representatives at SGA meetings can help give athletes a better opportunity to make changes and influence decisions being made on campus if they are present at these meetings, where these decisions often get made,” Londot said.
At the next SAAC meeting on Monday, Feb. 26, in the conference room facing the turf the SAAC athletes will discuss the status of their fundraising efforts, the success of the meeting with the administration.

On Wednesday, Feb. 7 the men’s basketball team clashed with Molloy College at home, earning the Pioneers an over time win.
The first half of the game was close; the score was 39-35 in favor of the Pioneers coming from their solid offense from senior guard, economics major, Kyle McLeggan when he posted 15 points and two assists. That wasn’t all the offense in the first half for green and gold, senior guard, business administration major, Aary Bibens put up 19 points with three assists.
The second half offensively for the Pioneers was more sound as they only shot 29.2 percent from the field, but made up for it by converting on 12 of 14 attempts at the free throw line, eight of those coming from McLeggan. With just over eleven and a half minutes left in the game, the Pioneers were down seven points; however, McLeggan was fouled on a three-point attempt, earning him three shots from the free throw line in which he converted on. Shortly after, a dunk from Molloy College’s Justin Caldwell widened the margin. But, the Pioneers weren’t ready to give up; with 8:45 left in regulation, McLeggan was able to convert on a layup, which was followed by freshman, business administration major, Austin Kennedy’s layup and extra point free throw which evened the score at 59-59.
After what seemed like a game of chess, regulation ended with a score of 69-69. As soon as over time started, McLeggan put the Pioneers ahead by two from a jumpshot. While regulation was neck and neck, over time was not as the Pioneers ended up winning with a score of 89-83.
Following their win on Wednesday, the Pioneers traveled to Queen’s College. Sophomore physical education major, Jared Rivers scored 20 points, including 16 in the second half, but the Pioneers dropped a close one against Queens College, 69-66 on the road Feb. 10.
Rivers filled the stat-sheet with 20 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists, along with 15 points from senior economics major Kyle Taylor-McLeggan.
Despite the loss, the Pioneers remain in sole possession of fourth place at 8-6 in the league standings. The Pioneers return to action on the road on Valentine’s Day, Wednesday, Feb. 14 against University of the District of Columbia at 7:00 p.m.

Men’s basketball’s freshman guard, general business major, Austin Kennedy from Medford, NJ has had a week to remember. On Jan. 29, Kennedy was named the East Coast Conference (ECC) Rookie of the Week. 
On Jan. 27, the Pioneers went up against the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) Bears in an East Coast Conference matchup. Kennedy racked up 25 points 5 assist, and 2 steals, which helped his teammates beat NYIT, 92- 79. Kennedy dedicates his success to his teammates, “ My teammates put me in situations to succeed and even though we came out extremely sluggish in the first half, we stuck with the game plan and fought back as a team all the way until the end.”
When asking Kennedy about how he felt about winning Rookie of the Week, his response was humble, “I was eating with some of the guys on the team and one of my teammates told me and I was like, ‘oh that’s cool;’ I didn’t really react too much.”
Peter Lipka, assistant coach for the men’s basketball team commented on Kennedy’s season, “We knew Austin could help our team right away so redshirting was not something we imagined. He’s a tough-minded kid that comes from a great high school program so he’s been prepared from day one. We imagine he’ll continue to grow as he gets more game experience and builds chemistry with his teammates. It’s been a pleasure to coach him.” Lipka said.
Even though Kennedy is just a freshman, it seems that he has the potential to be a star for the men’s basketball team.

On Wednesday, Feb. 7, the women’s basketball team went up against Molloy College at home, wearing pink socks for their Think Pink game for breast cancer awareness. This game was also the Pioneers’ second and final game against Molloy College for the season; their first matchup against Molloy was a victory, limiting Molloy to only 52 points in the first game. The Pioneers enjoyed another victory against Molloy.
The first half of the game was all Green and Gold, as the Pioneers were ahead of Molloy College with a score of 30-19, with 10 points coming from sophomore forward, broadcasting major, Mikaiya Moore, who also held her own on defense by blocking three shots. Sophomore guard, physical education major and health minor, Taylah Hudson also put up some numbers on the scoring sheet by draining 12 points and causing five steals.
While the first half was strong for the Pioneers, the second half was not. In the fourth quarter, Molloy College posted 23 points on the board and the Pioneers only put up 12. However, with just over two minutes left in the fourth quarter, following a layup by Molloy College, senior guard, broadcasting major and journalism minor, Kylie Garret was able to keep calm at the free throw line, making four free throws on four attempts, which ended the game with a score of 60-55 in favor of the Pioneers.
The team won its third straight game and improved its record to 18-6 overall and 13-1 in conference play with a 85-65 victory at Queens College three days later, on Feb. 10.
Senior political science major Sasha Patterson led the Pioneers with 19 points on 6-of-8 shooting and grabbed 11 rebounds for her fourth double-double in her last five games. Moore did it all in the win, as she scored 18 points along with eight rebounds and five assists. Sophomore health science major Dominique Williams was the third Pioneer to record 10 or more points against Queens College, with 12 points of her own.
The Pioneers kept their momentum the entire way, opening the game with the lead and finishing their 85-65 win without falling behind.
At one point in the third quarter, the Knights cut the deficit to within two points, but an 18-2 scoring run at the end of the third quarter and at the start of the fourth quarter allowed the Pioneers to lead as many as 24 points.
“Our full-court pressure was able to slow Queens down and we didn’t allow them to set up their half-court offense,” Moore said of the Pioneers’ win. “We were able to keep one of their best players, Merrick Rowland, out of the game by frustrating her and getting her into foul trouble. We did a good job moving the ball and executing our plays into quality baskets.”
The team returns to action on Wednesday, Feb. 14 for a Valentine’s Day matchup at the University of the District of Columbia at 5 p.m.
