For Michael Henry, who graduated with a BFA in acting, the success that followed his move to the west coast has been monumental. Henry started his YouTube channel, “Michael Henry” in April 2014 and has since accumulated 70,000 followers, with average viewership in the millions per video. Henry’s skits, improvisations and comedic outlook on what life throws at people quickly gained him a large following. 
Henry moved to Los Angeles in an attempt to challenge himself and experience the world of acting and performance outside of the college stage. In the Post Theater Company, the acting was “very avant garde, experimental and artistic,” he said, but his “natural instincts lead more to comedy.” In Los Angeles, he spent most of his time “going to improv classes, doing some stand up, and doing sketch comedy. And now I do my own YouTube channel.” 
His channel’s success over the past five
years has snowballed. As an advocate for the
LGBTQ community, Henry proudly uses the
global platform of YouTube to reach parts of
the world where people are alone, struggling
and may not get any form of representation.

“I get messages from people from Syria, China, Taiwan, Russia, [and] India. They don’t get to be themselves where they are,” he said. “A lot of these people don’t even have YouTube; they’re watching it on the dark corners of the web.” 
Henry believes that by continuing his channel and social media presence, he is aiding American society in accepting people. “We have a lot of things to work on in America when it comes to minority issues, but it’s really bad in a number of other places,” Henry said. He now knows that by being authentic to himself he is helping people, and that has been a humbling experience. “I get to tell stories of myself with myself and my friends that are a lot like most of the globe; I didn’t realize [it] was as impactful as it is,” he said. 
Henry recently starred in “Pig Hag,” a feature length film that will premiere at the SXSW film festival in Austin this March. “It [the movie] shows you someone authentically trying to make their life work, and I think we can all relate to that, especially people that don’t feel like they fit in,” Henry said. 
The film follows Jodie (Anna Schlegel), a
woman in her 30s dealing with the pressures
of trying to find love. She thinks she finds it at
a concert but is ghosted the next morning– the
definition of unlucky in love. The journey she
embarks on with her four gay best friends (one
played by Henry) following the concert prove
the importance of friendship.

“We’re her [Jodie’s] confidants; we are I guess her substitute for a ‘man’ romantically in her life,” Henry said. “She sees that having your strong friendship bonds are almost as important as having your male romantic bonds.” 
Henry has big plans for the future. “The next five years I plan on being the next Lisa Ray, the next Lena Dunham work-wise, people who have created their own stuff online and then been able to showcase it on a massive scale,” he said. Henry hopes to transition to television; his ultimate goal is to have his own television show whether it be digital, via cable or a broadcast. Henry said. “That’s what we all need; we don’t have any gay shows on television right now that actually tell their [the LGBTQ community] stories.” 
Reflecting on his time at Post and the things he has overcome since then, Henry said college is the perfect foundation for what he built on his own. “When it comes to creating things, just do it. You’re going to second guess yourself, you’re going to fail, but embrace failing,” he said.

Since Square Enix released “Kingdom Hearts II” in 2005, fans eagerly awaited the next installment in the series. The series has had a few side installments throughout the years, but none of them have managed to reach the levels of success the main entries have. That all ended on Jan. 29, when “Kingdom Hearts III” was released. 
“Kingdom Hearts” is a crossover series
between Disney’s cinematic hits and Square
Enix’s “Final Fantasy” games. The newest
entry in the series allows players to explore the
worlds from newer Disney movies such as “Big
Hero 6,” “Frozen,” and “Tangled.” Thanks to
Disney’s 2006 acquisition of Pixar, characters
from “Monsters, Inc” and “Toy Story” also
joined the star-studded cast.

Don’t let the Disney characters fool you, however; the game’s plot is still very dark and holds true to the serious tones of the “Final Fantasy” series. You play as Sora, a chosen hero of light who travels to the different worlds to find six heroes. These heroes will fight along- side him in an upcoming war. The antagonist, Xehanort, is likewise attempting to find others to stand alongside him in battle. The Keyblade War, the event the game leads up to, is a fated battle between light and darkness for control of Kingdom Hearts. If Sora and his friends fail, the power that Kingdom Hearts contains will fall into Xehanort’s hands, and life will be changed forever. 
Combat in “Kingdom Hearts III” is a combination of mechanics from the previous entries in the series. Returning veterans will be happy to see the return of mechanics, such as shot lock or reaction commands, while newcomers are slowly introduced to these functions and how they work. Taking the best of 13 years’ worth of mechanics makes the combat featured in “Kingdom Hearts III” smooth and responsive. 
Throughout my play, I never felt that the game deliberately put me at an unfair advantage, and that every enemy could be defeated by one of the mechanics at my disposal. This is a huge jump forward from previous entries in the series, where I felt limited by what options the game provided me in combat. 
Despite its strengths, “Kingdom Hearts III” is not without faults. The mini game sections feel very invasive and take you out of the moment. Certain story sections, such as the “Frozen” world, are just frame by frame retellings of the movies they are based on. 
The voice acting seems to be a mixed bag,
with certain characters sounding natural and
others sounding like they are reading a script.

This is in contrast to previous entries in the series where all of the characters sounded natural and as if they were actually present in the situation at hand. 
Students agree that the game could have
used some improvements. “I felt the story
wasn’t as good as One and the combat wasn’t as
good as Two,” Jesse Taylor, a sophomore game
design major, said. “I liked it for nostalgia, but
I felt like it would be hard for newcomers to get
into.”

Despite its flaws, “Kingdom Hearts III” is a
fantastic experience overall. I enjoyed almost
every moment of it and felt like the 13 year wait
was worth it.

“Kingdom Hearts III” is available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for $60.

The four-part documentary
“Conversations with a Killer: The
Ted Bundy Tapes,” released on
Jan. 24, became instantly popular
among Netflix users.

The episodes are composed of archival footage and audio recordings of Theodore “Ted” Robert Bundy, one of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, as well as reporters, detectives, district attorneys, and those who knew Bundy personally. 
Throughout the episodes, we
hear Bundy in his own words and
in the third person, explain the
rationale of his killings- seemingly
wanting to confess without taking
any sort of responsibility.

An unfortunate side effect of many true crime documentaries and TV shows is that many killers become “glamorized.” We can see the result of this as Twitter users had no shame in admitting an attraction to Bundy for his looks after the show had been released. 
However, this is an integral part of the series- he was a charming man with subjectively good looks, according to many. And an important message to take away from the series may be to differentiate charm from safety.
“It was shocking to see how he
could lure his victims that easily
just by being ‘good looking,’” Tove
Sparrman, a senior international
business major, said. “The part
that was most interesting was
probably Bundy’s ignorance and
how he thought he was better and
smarter than everyone else.”

The rights to the new Ted Bundy film “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile” by the same director, starring Lily Collins and Zac Efron, has reportedly been bought by Netflix.
 If you enjoyed watching “Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,” you may also enjoy watching “The Staircase” and “Evil Genius,” both on Netflix, “The Jinx,” on HBO, and the listening to the podcast “Crime Junkies” on Spotify. 
When consuming true crime
media, keep in mind that the
stories, victims, and their families
are real, and the crimes have had
tangible impacts on the lives of
everyone involved.

The latest exhibit at the S.A.L. gallery in the library, “Self-Destruction,” by junior art therapy major, Ruth Mistretta, is a powerful depiction of the artist’s indulgence in negative behaviors in order to forget the outside pressures of the world. 
The pieces entitled ‘Self Destruction’ shows two drawings of a figure with contrasting facial expressions. In the first picture, the model is holding a lit cigarette away from her body with a grim and distraught look on her face. In the second picture, the model’s facial expression changed to one that is happier and more at peace, as she blows out the smoke from the cigarette.
The artist created this specific piece of artwork as a way to cope with overwhelming emotions as she grew up. She began smoking at 14-years-old, and despite knowing how much smoking negatively impacts her health, she continued to do so. Smoking filled the void within her that nothing else could; it provided her serenity and enveloped her with a calm feeling that made her mind feel at ease, even if it was just for a moment. Eventually she fought against her desire to smoke and the urge to indulge in behaviors that she knew would only negatively impact her in the long run. To this day, she continues to do just that. 
Mistretta’s “Yin” and junior art education major, Madelynn Ehmer’s “Yang” also grace the walls of the gallery. The duo’s work shows an intricate line that connects two brains that despite looking similar on the outside, differ greatly on the inside. 
In Chinese philosophy, the principle of Yin and Yang is that all things in life have contradictory opposites that cannot exist without the other. Yin is dark, and is associated with negativity and femininity. Yang is the opposite, it represents light, and is associated with positivity and masculinity. 
The artwork shows one brain filled with bright colors and objects that instill human beings with feelings of joy such as a cute kitten, sweet drinks and treats such as coffee and cookies, and holidays that are meant to bring families together as exemplified by
the skeleton wearing flowers which
is a clear depiction of Day of the
Dead.

The second brain is associated with darker colors and makes the audience wonder more about the artist who created the piece. It is evident that although the artist has essential components of life within her drawing such as water and the moon, she is still on a path to figuring out what truly makes her happy. 
The line that connects both of these brains represents how despite their differences, the authors have a shared love of artwork and creative expression which may not make them so different from one another after all.

The Rainbow Alliance and the Forensic Science clubs co-sponsored the Disney Ball in the Tilles Atrium on Feb. 13. About 30 attendees enjoyed dressing in themed costumes, listening to well-known Disney songs, eating Italian food catered by Aramark, and participating in activities and games. Students paid a $10 admission fee at the event’s table in Hillwood or $15 admission fee at the door. 
“[The] Forensics Science Club and us
wanted to do something special together, and
we decided that a Valentine’s event would be
cool,” Nicole Ludwig, sophomore psychology
major and president of the Rainbow Alliance,
said. The Disney concept was a way to bring the
community together.

“The event is very fun, it has lively tables and people to talk to, and free food,” Reese Roselle, freshman game design major, said. Throughout the evening, the soundtrack consisted of “the Disney music that you would recognize right away whether you hate [it] or not,” Roselle said. This included songs such as “Colors of the Wind” and “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?” 
The clubs met to choose what decorations, games, and music would be featured. It took about two weeks to plan the event. Each table for eight had decorations inspired by different Disney films including “Moana,” “The Little Mermaid,” “Beauty and the Beast,” and “Cinderella.” Attendees played Disney Pictionary, trivia, and participated in karaoke. Winners received prizes in the form of $20 gift cards for Subway, Starbucks and Dominos.
Erin Gorden, senior forensic science major and president of the Forensic Science Club, decided to co-sponsor the event with the Rainbow Alliance when she heard both clubs were interested in hosting something for Valentine’s Day. “I’m looking forward to people having fun however way they want to have fun,” Gorden said. People sang along and danced to the well- known songs playing over the speakers. “That’s the best part of any event.” 
“I’ve always loved Disney, and [I] love going to Disney World with my friends and my family, so I when I heard about this, I definitely wanted to come,” Danielle Fasano, junior childhood and special education major, said. The clubs advertised the Disney Ball over social media. The iconic image of Cinderella’s castle hung on the wall. “Having the castle up is cool, it makes me feel like we’re in Disney World,” Fasano said. 
Some attendees dressed up for the occasion.
“Some people are wearing different things like
Minnie Mouse bows and actual outfits from
Disney movies.” Roselle said. Fasano donned
“Beauty and the Beast” themed Minnie Mouse
ears that she brought from a previous Disney
World trip.

Tiffany Holtje, junior art education major, enjoyed the food at the event. Garlic knots were an overall favorite of the evening. “This event in college, it makes you feel like a kid again,” Holtje said. 
Since she is graduating in May, Gorden would be happy to see more events like the Disney Ball take place again with more clubs involved. “I would love to see stuff like that happen, where I’m leaving behind something
while I’m gone.”

“It’s a good event because Disney happens to be one of the most childhood-oriented things you could think of,” Roselle said. “It’s just really nostalgic and it feels nice.”

Over 30 student-athletes volunteered for the
“A Night to Shine” prom for individuals with
special needs on Long Island on Friday, Feb. 8.

The event, sponsored by the Tim Tebow Foundation, was hosted by Church Unleashed at its Commack campus. This year marked the fifth anniversary of the event; 655 churches from around the world came together to host the prom on the same night. This is the first year the event was hosted by Church Unleashed. 
Ninety two “honorary guests” attended the event with their families and caretakers. There were 220 volunteers, 34 from Post. The volunteers were split into “administrators,” who served snacks, and “buddies,” who were paired with a guest and were their date for the night. Buddies did everything with their guest from dancing, talking, and relaxing in the respite, or relief, rooms. 
Lea Brady, a junior healthcare administration major, is a member of Church Unleashed and was one of the 34 Post student volunteers. Brady said her church had applied to host the event three years prior, and this was the first time they were approved. “It is a very special one night of the year,” she said. 
After the event, volunteers and families messaged Brady saying how impressed they were with the set up and shared their excitement for the years to come. 
Bency Ortiz, executive assistant to the lead pastors Todd and Mary Bishop at Church Unleashed, was in charge of coordinating the event and community outreach for donations. “I found a lot of the organizations [in Commack] wanted to be a part of this because it’s never happened before in the community. Everything from food to desserts, entertainment and special guests were all donated,” she said. 
A lot went into preparing for the night, according to Ortiz. Leading up to the event, the church held a boutique dress and tuxedo drive. All of the dress attire was donated, including several brand-new dresses. Guests who already registered could come and pick out a free outfit to wear to the prom. 
A pre-prom event featured volunteers doing hair and makeup for the women and shoe shining for the men, and a respite room where guests were pampered and given massages. At the prom, the guests and their buddies could take a limo ride around the block and enter the space on a red carpet through a balloon archway. Ortiz wanted it to be magical. “We wanted to love on our guests, love on our volunteers and let them know they are special and unique,” she said. 
Ortiz said it is difficult for some families to attend services and events for special needs children because they don’t want to disrupt the programs. That’s why they created the “Champions Club” space in their church. The Champions Club features a sensory room, motor skills room, and discovery room for individuals with special needs to go and relax. “We made the rooms available for our guests [at the prom] to have a chance to relieve themselves from the noise, or if they needed to calm down,” Ortiz said. 
Ortiz said they wanted the night to be fun
and enjoyable for everyone from the guests to
the buddies and the parents. Volunteers over
18-years-old, and all of the “buddies” had to
undergo background screenings and attend
training prior to the prom; the goal was for
the buddies to be able to cater to their guests’
needs and to be prepared for any situation.
“We wanted the parents to sit back and relax,
since it’s a 24 hour job for them,” she said.

Elise Strange, a senior psychology major, was a buddy that night. She was with her buddy all night, doing whatever he wanted to do. “My buddy loved eating; he was eating everything,” she said. Later in the night, she accompanied her buddy to one of the separate rooms to relax. “People with more sensory issues could go to another room for pet therapy, a coloring center and just a quiet space. It was amazing with all the different options they had,” she said. 
The highlight of the night was the crowning ceremony. Each of the 86 guests was called up one by one to a stage and sat on throne-like seats while being crowned king or queen of the night by two Disney princesses, Ariel and Moana. “The smiles on their faces and the emotions they showed” made the night, Ortiz said. This event is the first time many of these guests ever experienced a prom, and the volunteers and members of the church wanted them to feel special. 
Ortiz received much feedback from parents and volunteers that the event was “tremendously live changing for them.” During the prom she approached a mother who was very emotional. “I asked her if she was okay and she said, ‘I’ve never seen my daughter so happy.’ It was really nice to see,” Ortiz said. 
“We are really grateful for all our volunteers,” Ortiz said. “The event could not have happened, first and foremost without the grace of God, and second without our volunteers.”

Many people wonder what type of macro-nutrient, whether it be a carbohydrate, protein, or fat, is the most efficient type of fuel for the brain and ultimately the body. 
Scientists identified carbohydrates as the preferred form of nutrition for the brain. The brain uses about 20 percent of the body’s oxygen and up to 50 percent of the body’s total glucose (blood sugar). It’s important that we fuel our brains with the absolute best substances. But what substances are best? 
This dilemma inspired the creation of fad diets that claim to be the “most effective in producing raw energy.” The Atkins and Keto diets are just two diets that have become popularized in American society. However, studies conclude
that while these diets are effective in shifting
body composition, they, as well as all diets,
should be closely researched before starting.

The basis of both the Atkins and Keto diets
stem from our ancestors and the fact that food
often wasn’t readily available to them. During
these times they experienced a carbohydrate
deficit, forcing the body to use stored fat and
protein as a fuel to survive.

The goal of the Atkins diet is to reduce one’s carbohydrate intake to about 25 grams per day, equivalent to half of a potato. At the same time you increase your intake of both proteins and fats. In this diet, consuming fewer carbs will decrease cravings and skew the body towards burning stored fat for energy, ultimately leading to weight loss. 
The Keto diet, while similar to Atkins, is stricter since it aims to reduce carb intake to below 20 grams per day, and emphasizes consuming healthy fats such as avocados and olive oil. 
“Keto” is derived from the biological process
ketosis, where ketone molecules are produced
and the body burns fat as its primary source of
fuel. If the body remains in this carbohydrate
deprived state, fat will become the main source
of fuel and will burn rapidly.

A diet abundant in carbs signals the body to
use them for immediate energy and continue to
retain stored fat. But cutting out carbs may not
be the most favorable way to lose weight.

Many people who begin these diets report side effects such as weakness, dizziness, brain fog, and heart palpitations. If you are thinking of beginning a new diet, especially if you suffer from any health conditions or have dietary restrictions, you should always consult with a medical professional first.

Dr. John Lutz, professor of English and chairperson of the department of English, philosophy, and foreign languages, is working on a new book, “When Grief Hath Mates: Empathy and the Human Imagination.” The book, according to Lutz, “is an interdisciplinary explanation of empathy through fields such as neuroscience, literature, social psychology, evolutionary biology, [and] philosophy.” 
Dr. John Lutz, professor of English, is working on a new book
The opening will explore recent writing on empathy, while the rest of the book will deal with literary works “where the author is explicitly interested in empathy.” Some of those works are Homer’s “The Iliad,” William Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” Ivan Turgenev’s “Sketches from a Hunter’s Album,” and Fyodor Dostoevsky’s “The Brothers Karamazov.” 
The first chapter will cover Homer’s “The Iliad,” which Lutz considers to be the foundation of empathy in Western literature. “The great scene of empathy in The Iliad is the scene where Achilles gives back to Priam Hector’s body, and in the fact the way it’s described in the Iliad is that Achilles thinks of his own father and how he’ll feel when he’s [dead], and then he feels empathy for Priam and returns Hector’s body to him because he is able to put himself in Priam’s place, which is a good description of what empathy is,” Lutz said.
Empathy, according to Lutz, can be related to sympathy and compassion, but is distinct from those two. “Sympathy is feeling bad for a person, not the same thing. Empathy is feeling what they feel, or approximating what they feel,” he said. 
Lutz believes there are challenges to being empathetic. The key “empathy blocker” is perception of difference. “If somebody thinks that some other person or group is somehow doing harm to them, I think that could prevent empathy for the whole group,” Lutz said. 
Literature, according to Lutz, can give us the
imagination needed to see how others suffer
and think. It “enables us to put ourselves in the
position of those who we otherwise would not
necessarily come into contact with,” he said.

Focusing on the similarities and common ground that we share cultivates empathy, Lutz said. “We all need shelter, we all need food, we all need a sense of belonging, we all need security. Those are common across all cultures.” Likewise, empathy can actually help the appreciation of the authentic differences peoples can have, keeping these differences from becoming antagonistic. “All this talk of difference is important, but I think you can’t appreciate difference and respect it without first recognizing a kind of common human ground on which we all reside,” he said. 
Lutz encourages others to read literature to promote empathy, especially literature from other cultures. “I think that cultivating a kind of openness to the point of view of others, listening rather than talking to others, and actively trying to understand where they’re coming from before leaping to a judgment would be [great] advice,” he said. “Empathy is fundamentally connected to my commitment to the liberal arts and sciences, which is to me something that teaches the value of perspective-taking, and inhabiting the world that other peoples might inhabit.” 
Empathy, according to Lutz, should be extended even to “bad” people. He cited Raskolnikov, the student-murderer of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s “Crime and Punishment,” and Humbert Humbert, the pedophile and rapist of Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita” as examples. “We do need to have empathy for those who are bad, because we need to understand evil so that we can prevent it,” Lutz said. “Empathy is not endorsement, and that’s where I think people get confused.” 
“King Lear” shows the problems that arise from the absence of empathy, Lutz said. “Shakespeare’s deeply caught up in the problem of empathy, and the play is a depiction of the consequences of the absence of empathy,” he said. “So by being disenfranchised himself, he comes to occupy and recognize what it’s like to be the very lowest beggar in society, and that leads him to at least the idea that he has to do something.” 
Lutz’s interest in this project started from his meditations on his readings. “When I started thinking about it, I started thinking about numerous books that I loved, where the authors were deeply engaged in dealing with empathy as a human problem.” He saw it in action in all these books. 
Lutz anticipates his book will be finished in two years; he is currently “well into the research for the opening introduction.” He does not yet have a publisher lined up.

Thirteen students protested in the Pratt Recreation Center gym on Sunday, Feb. 17 by wearing sports bras and crop tops while working out. This protest was in response to a female student who said she was kicked out of the center for wearing a sports bra. Madison Hansmeyer, a sophomore musical theater major, had not even started her workout in the weight room on Thursday, Feb. 14, when she was approached by a male personal trainer who was sitting in the office area of the gym, and asked to leave because of her attire. 
Hansmeyer took to Instagram after the incident, writing, “Dear @liupost male coach, I
have been wearing sports bras
to the gym for 3 weeks straight
with no problem but please let
me know why I got kicked out
today for ‘potentially spreading
skin diseases’ after taking one
step into the gym and not even
putting my stuff down, let
alone ‘getting my body stuff on
all the equipment’ while your
basketball teams [sic] balls are
hanging out of their shorts and
over every piece of workout
gear while sweating vodka.”

Hansmeyer went on to describe how she offered to not lay on any equipment and just “run and do arms,” but the coach
said he would have to follow her
around the gym to make sure she
was telling the truth.

“He said it was a health violation, and when I asked why, he couldn’t tell me anything, he couldn’t show me where it said I couldn’t wear my sports bra,” Hansmeyer said. She pointed out the attire of the men working out: tank tops with exposed sides and short shorts. But she said the coach was fumbling to give her a response. 
Hansmeyer goes to the gym
every day, and said this is the first
time she was asked to leave for her
attire. This was not the first time
she wore a sports bra to the gym.
“He [the coach] was the only one
who told me to leave,” she said.

Alex Cordova, a junior public relations major and member of the swim team, was present during the encounter with Hansmeyer, and said that wasn’t exactly how it happened. 
Cordova said Hansmeyer’s
outfit was not appropriate for the
public space. “She was wearing a
green sports bra that was more for
show than for working out, and
black high waisted shorts, but they
didn’t cover her butt well,” she
said.

The gym is open to students, faculty, staff and the community (for a membership fee). Cordova said the coach was telling Hansmeyer that she couldn’t lay on the equipment in her attire because she’d be susceptible to receiving and spreading germs. “Why would you even want to expose your body to those kind of germs,” Cordova
said. According to the office of
campus recreation, shirts should
cover the full chest and back to
prevent ringworm, MRSA, staph
and other infections.

Cordova said the rule applies
to all gym visitors; even men who
wear ripped t-shirts or tank tops
are told to go and change.

The Pratt Recreation Center has no dress code listed under the policies section of its website. The Student Handbook, available online, also does not list a dress code for any campus facility. Signs posted on the walls in the gym advise students to spray and wipe down the equipment when they finish using it, put weights back on the racks, and that proper attire is required. 
After visiting the Pratt Recreation Center on Saturday, Feb. 16, The Pioneer found signs posted on both sides of the door to the workout room. Proper attire, according to the sign, means athletic wear such as sweats, athletic shorts, full-length t-shirts and tank tops; no midriffs or backs exposed. Proper footwear is required, meaning closed toe, clean athletic shoes or sneakers only; no flip flops allowed. Hansmeyer said the sign was not there when she went to the gym Friday. Student workers at Pratt said the policy began in the beginning of the fall 2018 semester. 
Dean of Students, Michael Berthel, learned of the incident after Hansmeyer’s Instagram post. He is meeting with Hansmeyer later in the week. “Maintaining the health and safety of LIU students is the most important job we have. Policies are implemented utilizing best practices, health and safety guidelines, and overall student experience. My door is always open for students to discuss concerns regarding a policy or any concern they may have at the university.” 
This incident is not the first time a female student has been told her gym attire is not appropriate. Lee Metaxa Rozenfeld, a sophomore musical theater major, said something similar happened to her in early September. “I was on the bicycle for about five minutes when [a] girl who worked there came up to me and said her boss told her to tell me, which I thought it was strange he didn’t tell me himself, that I can’t wear my outfit in the gym because it was inappropriate,” she said. 
Rozenfeld was dressed in a crop top and high waisted leggings which covered most of her lower stomach and her entire chest area; very little skin was showing. She had to leave and change her shirt. “It was very uncomfortable because everyone who was around me heard it,” she added. 
Rozenfeld said she never had a chance to talk about her encounter with anyone aside from the female students in her department who’ve had similar experiences. She said she doesn’t see the problem with how they dress and noted that women cover what needs to be covered, but they still sweat a lot when working out. “Sometimes guys are shirtless and wear short shorts, so what’s the difference,” she said. 
The same scenario happened to Stephanie Jeker, a sophomore theater major, in the fall 2018 semester. Before she could walk into the gym, she was stopped by a male personal trainer and told to put a shirt on. When she told him that she didn’t have one, he gave her a clean t-shirt they had in the office for her to use. 
Jeker said she wore a sports bra
that day because it gets very hot
in the gym. “Not wearing a shirt
over a sports bra wasn’t a rule,”
she said. She noted that men in
the gym workout shirtless or wear
muscle shirts that expose “their
whole body basically.”

Jeker didn’t stay very long after because she felt uncomfortable. “I was very confused and angry, because it’s the gym. It’s ridiculous that we can’t wear something that we’re comfortable in and that we can work out in when it gets hot in the gym. It’s not for any different reason,” she said. 
But some students find the
dress code reasonable. Michaela
Fox, a junior musical theater
major, is often at Pratt throughout
the week. She said the sign on the
front door has not always been
there, but that it shows a common
rule for most gyms to promote
modesty and respect – for both
men and women.

Fox said the rule should be
enforced equally among men and
women, and doesn’t believe that
the policy is sexist. “Men can’t
workout shirtless either,” she said.
“Either enforce it for everyone or
don’t at all.”

“She was wearing a green sports bra that was more for show than for working out, and black high waisted shorts, but they didn’t cover her butt well,”
I’m sorry but the point of a sports bra is for working out. The idea that someone is wearing an outfit for attention is ridiculous and is such a older, closed off mindset.
Also catching MRSA from gym equipment is highly unlikely you’re more likely to catch athletes foot and if we are cleaning the equipment properly we shouldn’t really have to worry. Most of the time they say staph or MRSA to freak us out but it is highly unlikely to catch and even more unlikely to be super serious. Staph is only dangerous when it gets into an open cut or scrape.
The facts are simple, women in the gym are being told to cover up and men are not. That isn’t okay. In the outside world you can work out in a sports bra, why are we so fixated on sexualizing the female body that workout attire is deemed inappropriate. A sports bra covers more than a bikini and women aren’t told to cover up at the beach. Why do we then have to cover up at the gym when the outfit is designed for the task?

While the spring collegiate sports are at the beginning of their seasons, intramural sport sign-ups are open for the semester. In intramural sports, students compete against each other, rather than against neighboring college teams. Each year, 500-700 students are involved with intramural sports, according to associate director for recreational sports fitness and intramurals Martin Guillet. 
There are nine intramural sports in the spring. Registration for ping pong is open all semester. Basketball and men’s and women’s racquetball leagues already began in the beginning of February, but students can still join teams throughout the season. The last day to join the basketball league is on Feb. 25, and the racquetball league registration is open until the last day of the semester. Upcoming intramural sports in March and April include wiffle ball home run derby, softball, 4 on 4 indoor soccer, volleyball and a fitness challenge.
 “Most of the kids that play, they love it and they play every year,” Guillet said. One of those students is senior nursing major Andrew Ris. He has played intramural basketball for all of his college years on the team called The Post Boys. Ris sees intramural sports as a great way to get together with his friends and “have fun while competing against others who are looking to do the same thing.” 
All the events are organized by the department of campus recreation, but there are no scheduled practices for the sports. The teams or individuals are free to organize training sessions in their own time. “There are lots of teams that play that take it a little bit more seriously and they will set up practices on their own; then we organize the games,” Guillet said. 
The only requirement to be able to sign up for intramural sports is to be a current student registered for the semester. Prior experience in a sport is not required. “There are definitely different levels of people who play. We have people who played in high school that are very competitive and take it very seriously and then there are other kids who are just playing for fun,” Guillet said. 
Ris belongs to the group of players who played sports in high school. Even though he and his teammates can be competitive, they try to make the experience fun for everyone. “I think towards the end of the season, it definitely gets more competitive but throughout the regular season we definitely try to have some fun and make it as fun as possible for everyone involved, such as the refs and all the players,” Ris said. 
Ris strongly encourages other students
to get involved with intramural sports.
“I think everyone on campus should be
involved. I think it’s a great way to get
involved with campus activities, make
friends and kind of just enjoy college
life,” he said.

Students can sign up for intramural sports in Guillet’s office located in the gym behind the front desk of Pratt Recreation Center, or online at https://www. imleagues.com/liupost.

In October 2018, LIU announced that the LIU Post and the LIU Brooklyn athletic teams were merging, becoming ONE LIU and a Division I sports program. Some of the LIU Post athletic programs would be discontinued, but not the football program. The football program will remain on the Brookville campus. The football team ended its season with a Northeast-10 Championship, a 10-1 record, and a first-round loss to Slippery Rock. 
With the football program changing from Division II to Division I and a move to the Northeast Conference, head coach Bryan Collins and his staff have been busy getting ready for their inaugural Division I season by signing more than 31 recruits for the upcoming season. 
This is the biggest recruiting class the program has had, regardless of level of play. Coach Collins and his staff recruited players in nine different states this year including Virginia, Florida, Illinois, and Maryland. “The competition is elevated now. With where LIU is located, it makes it very attractive place to come to for the next four, five years,” Coach Collins said. “We wanted to become a more national brand than a regional brand.” 
The football team will have 15 starting seniors graduate in May, including Chris Coles, Jake Carlock, Malik Pierre and Mike Richardson, who were all three-year starters. “I believe every single position has been filled with this recruiting class,” Coach Collins said. 
He and his staff changed up their recruiting tactics for the Division I level. “Many of the players we recruited are receiving academic scholarships. I think it’s important nationally
that we recruit that kind of player that the
university projects as increasing our national
brand,” Coach Collins said.

In the past four years, the football team had three starting transfer quarterbacks: Jeff Kidd (2015-2016), Yianni Gavalas (2017), Chris Laviano (2018), and for 2019, according to Coach Collins, junior transfer quarterback Clay Bethard from Iowa Western College has the potential to start this season. 
The team has recruited two top quarterbacks including Camden Orth from Florida and Luke Sprague from Pennsylvania. “We’re very happy with our incoming quarterbacks. It’s going to be a very good competition this season,” Coach Collins said.
