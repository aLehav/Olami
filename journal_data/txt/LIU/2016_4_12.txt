Within just 15 minutes of walking into the library, three people stopped to talk excitedly to Anthony Losardo, and they all want to discuss one thing: beer. Losardo, a senior at accounting major, started Bayside Brewery about three years ago, and he plans to officially launch his business this July.
According to an article published by metro.us in January, “Losardo opened up his grandmother’s garage in Bayside, purchased a how-to- book, trademarked the company name and got to work” on developing a signature beer.
The Pioneer profiled Bayside Brewery in October 2015, describing how students from multiple majors at Post, including the biology, dance, marketing and film/audio departments, help run and develop the company. Since then, the company has expanded the outreach with bioresearch to Hartwick University, and is in the process of developing graphic art with the art department. Jason Rubenfield, a junior business marketing major, said that about nine students are currently involved in running the business.
The company brews its seven types of beer in Bayside and will soon be moving to Long Island City. Because Bayside Brewery has yet to officially launch, it has not sold any of its beer. Up until this point, their beer has only been involved in networking events where people are introduced to the products, merchandise, and the team. Losardo said he met many investors at these networking events, and he is looking forward to two upcoming networking events before the launch of the company, the Pink Tie 1,000 and Taste of Queens. Bayside Brewery is involved with the Queens Economic Development Board where they were put on the international tourism guide for Queens.
“We don’t sell beer, we provide beer,” Losardo explained of their current services.
Since Bayside Brewery’s office is moving from the library to Long Island City, the company will be able to get licensed and sell its beer.
With Losardo and two other students who help run the different departments of the company graduating this spring, the dynamic of the company will also undergo some changes. Losardo said the “business will have 100 percent of his time” after he graduates and that he plans on hiring many of the other graduating seniors as employees. He also plans on hiring more interns, especially from the Biology department, and his goal is to “stay in touch with the local market” and continue to generate new ideas.
The future of the company seems to be headed in the right direction as the have been consulting with former Guinness Brew Master Fergal Murray. According to Rubenfield, Murray is helping scale their recipe from a small scale to a large scale commercial brewing, and it is information like this that will help them gain the interest of investors.
Bayside Ale is the company’s flagship ale, and Rubenfield said it is the only sweet pale ale on the market. “It has a light, hoppy flavor on the front half and a sweet, gentle finish on the back half,” he said.
After Bayside Brewery launches this summer, all seven brews will be available on tap in multiple bars in Long Beach, Freeport, Bayside, Queens, Huntington, and near Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Losardo said that because Bayside brews a “higher end beer,” it will sell for about $8 a glass.

Property Damage
On Feb. 25, the complainant states he parked his vehicle in the upper Hillwood Commons lot. He claims when he returned to his vehicle three hours later he found damage to his driver’s side, rear bumper, trunk and tail light.
On Feb. 29, the complainant states she was trying to find a parking spot near Hoxie Hall. She pulled into the lot entrance and noticed a car by the south chain. She further stated she could not see the east chain on her right side because it was very low. The chain snapped and hit her vehicle causing damage to her car.

Katie Muller, a graduate student in digital game design and development program, recently designed levels for the game Imago as part of her internship at Arkadium.
While the game, Imago, was already created, it was Muller’s job was to design how the game looks. “I pretty much said what buttons go where, how players choose levels. The level mechanics, making numbers/score go up or down, win and lose conditions, as well as the Leaderboards and how those work. I also designed most of the levels that are generated, since they were all pre-made and there are hundreds,” said Muller. The mode she helped create is called Daily Flight and is unlocked after the player reaches a certain score in the level of the last stage of the game.
The games team at Arkadium heard through emails and ratings that players really wanted Imago to be expanded. A development team consisting of five programmers, artists, and game designers, as well as a few others from Arkadium’s Krasnodar office in Russia, helped to develop the new modes. Together they worked to design daily challenges, in hopes that players would never get bored and have something new to come back to everyday. At her internship with Arkadium this semester, Muller has had a chance to participate in the development of Imago, and she is listed on the credits for the release.
Imago is currently released on the App Store (iOS) as well as on Google Play (Android), however the recent Daily Flight update hasn’t been released on Android yet, but will be soon. Imago is a mobile game that can also be played on tablets.
Muller took courses in the game design and development program during her sophomore year of college, when the program was only for graduate students. She graduated from LIU Post with an English writing degree in 2015, and stayed on as a graduate assistant in the master’s program. Muller was a member of the staff of the Pioneer in 2014. “I actually spent a lot of my younger years writing and illustrating my own stories. As I grew older, I wanted to find a way that I would be able to combine my writing and art together, and game design really does that. I love that I can create worlds for people to explore,” said Muller.“Honestly, the best part to me is seeing people’s reactions to your game after it’s finished. You worked so hard on designing so many intricate, important things — like, how long a power up lasts, how high a player can jump, all these things affect a game and can easily made it unpleasant if designed improperly. Then you see people playing it and how happy they are, and their excited reactions and wanting to keep playing. It’s super rewarding.”
The graduate game design and development program began in fall 2011, and the undergraduate program began in fall 2015. “We are really excited about the overwhelming interest we have received from students so far, as the program is growing at an incredibly fast pace,” said Corbetta. The program currently has a total of 30 students.
Students applying to the undergraduate program do not need any specific prior experience. Each aspect of game development is taught with the assumption that students are learning it for the first time.
Representatives from Arkadium, including David Or, the senior game developer and project lead, and Will Bredbeck, director of visual design/creative director, will be on campus on Wednesday, April 13, from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m. in the game lab, (Humanities 205), to recruit students for their summer internship program. They are looking for interns in game design, game programming, visual design, project management, and marketing. The information session is open to students of all majors.
The graduate game design and development program is still accepting applications for fall 2016. Email Ramiro Corbetta, the director of the program, at Ramiro.Corbetta@liu.edu for more information.
