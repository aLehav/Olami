On January 5th, 2011, the School of Visual and Performing Arts(SVPA) sponsored a special lecture by Kenneth Wayne, Ph.D., on one of the most renown artists in history; Amedeo Modigliani.
The lecture was held for a packed crowd in the Great Hall.  Professor of Art Frank Olt and SVPA Acting Dean Benjamin Moore introduced Dr. Wayne, the author of Modigliani and the Artists of Montparnasse. Wayne, one of the leading experts on Modigliani was educated at a multitude of prestigious universities including Stanford University where he received his Ph. D., the Courtauld Institute of Art, the University of London, and the University of California, Berkeley. His lecture spanned Modigliani’s life and achievements, from his early years in Italy to his work in Paris.  The lecture included a slideshow of Modigliani’s sculptures and paintings.
Modigliani was born into a Jewish family in Livorno, Italy in 1884. He traveled the world and created hundreds of works of art that thousands of people still admire today. He lived in Venice and ultimately settled down in France where he died in January, 1920 of tubercular meningitis. Recently, Modigliani’s work has broken records in sales. His sculpture titled “Head” from a French collection sold in June 2010 for 52 million dollars. In addition, Modigliani broke his own record when his painting “La Belle Roumain” sold for 69 million dollars in October 2010.
Following the lecture, Wayne joined the students, faculty and guests for light refreshments, and answered questions about Amedeo Modigliani.
