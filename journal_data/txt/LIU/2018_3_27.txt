Queen Mab, what’s the worst that can happen to you if you reveal your name? Will you lose your job? Lose your scholarship? Or face expulsion? According to the first amendment: nothing. Is this true?
Queen Mab, an anonymous poet, has been taping her poetry to doors and walls on campus. Her first poem, “Ode to a Campus Bike,” commented on the university’s costly efforts to provide 25 bikes for student use on campus shortly before Homecoming weekend. After a few weeks, the bikes were broken or missing, and Queen Mab wrote, “How quickly all of you [the bikes] have vanished and left us to mourn your loss/Leaving many of us wondering just how much you had all cost.”
She didn’t stop there. Queen Mab next wrote the poem, “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Campus Bike,” which followed Wallace Stevens’ format for his poem, “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.” Then, she posted a new poem on a door in Humanities Hall almost immediately after LIU President Kimberly Cline’s announcement of an extra credit charge. “More Debt and the New Tuition Plan (with Apologies to Dr. Seuss)” followed Dr. Seuss’ format for “Green Eggs & Ham.”
Although revolutionary at LIU, Queen Mab is not the first to use anonymity to express opposition to authority. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay wrote “The Federalist Papers” anonymously, under the name Publius.
What would have happened to them if they revealed their names? Perhaps prison. But most probably: death.
Anonymity is a weapon used against those in power, who might cause harm to those who oppose them. Queen Mab uses this powerful tool to express her opinions on the university’s use of money, tuition, and services. Although many might wish for her to reveal her identity, if she does, grave consequences might follow.
Her right to freedom of speech should protect her, but what if it didn’t? This is why she chooses anonymity, a type of freedom of speech that is protected, and protects her.
Mary Pigliacelli, director of the writing center and an adjunct professor in the English department, said, “I really like the idea of poetry being used for a political statement because I think that’s one of the things poetry is good for. It’s a powerful vehicle for important issues.”
Alicia Miguel, sophomore nutrition major said, “She says everything we’re all thinking in the most beautiful and sarcastic way.”
Writers and anonymity have resulted in harmful situations to those who refuse to submit to authority. For example, Giardano Bruna wrote many things in contradiction with the church. He was later imprisoned and burned at the stake. Journalist, Judith Miller refused to provide the court with her anonymous source. In result, she was imprisoned.
Although these situations are extreme, Queen Mab is anonymous for a reason. Her writing is controversial and critical of the university. What is at stake for her?

Dr. Randy Burd officially started his position as Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs at Long Island University on Jan. 1. He replaces Jeff Kane, who was the vice president of academic affairs from 2002 until Aug. 31, 2017. Lori Knapp, LIU Post’s vice president for academic affairs, and Gayle Haynes, LIU Brooklyn’s vice president for academic affairs, Duleep Deosthale, the dean of Global Academic Programs & Initiatives, and John Pezzuto, Vice President of LIU Health & Research Dean-Pharmacy, report to him. In his new position, Burd oversees all academic units and research goals for all LIU campuses.
The biggest challenge – or opportunity as he states – he is faced with is establishing and elevating a research enterprise at the university. In his first month in office, he was focused on doing just that. “Establishing a foundation to build a comprehensive, globally engaged, research institution that is interconnected with academic programs [is] something I’m actively doing and will spend most of my time on,” he said.
Michael Soupios, professor of political science, agrees that building the research programs is a worthy goal. However, “the financial realities at LIU are such that prospects for attaining such a goal are not realistic,” he stated.
Burd was hired by President Kimberly R. Cline and a search committee made up of faculty and administrators, including Alexander Henderson, Larry Banks, Lorraine Cicero, Denise Dick, Kathleen Feeley, Christopher Fevola, Gale Haynes, Michael Kavic, John Lutz, Barbara Parisi, Andy Person John Pezzuto, Edward Summers, and Robert Valli. “I saw tremendous opportunity at LIU and I felt it was a great t at launching many things here that I’ve built before,” he said about his decision to join the university. “LIU is on a great trajectory and I’m honored to work with the fantastic students and faculty here and continue to elevate the university.”
Alexander Henderson, a professor in the department of health care and public administration, served on the search committee and evaluated candidates for the Senior Vice President position. “Dr. Burd emerged during the search process as an outstanding fit for LIU. He has a strong track record of building research partnerships, creating infrastructure that supports and encourages faculty research, and an intense focus on student academic success,” Henderson said.
Burd, was a native of Buffalo, N.Y., is interested in cancer research. He received a B.A. in biological sciences from SUNY Buffalo in 1994, a Ph.D. in molecular and cellular biophysics from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute at the University at Buffalo, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in cancer biology at Thomas Jefferson University, where he performed research in the area of biology and cancer therapeutics, in 2001.
Burd served most recently as the associate vice president for research for almost two years at the University of Arizona, where he was a tenured professor in the department of nutritional sciences. Before that, he spent four years as an assistant vice president for program innovation and an assistant director of distance and global initiatives at the University of Arizona, where he developed workshops and training for faculty in technology advancement in STEM education. He also led a team focused on the development of international research.
He taught at Thomas Jefferson University from 2002-2005 as an assistant professor in the department of radiation oncology and also served as the director of preclinical therapeutics in the department of radiology. He founded and directed a pharmaceutical program that focused on drug development with pharmaceutical companies at Thomas Jefferson University.
Burd’s current position differs from his prior position at the University of Arizona, where he was more heavily focused on global research. Now he is more focused on building a strong foundation from the ground up for academics and research at LIU.
“I hope he brings a fresh outlook of change and diversity to our academic community that will provide the students of our campus the tools necessary to be successful off and on the campus, so that students can be proud to say they’ve attended a remarkable school,” Casey Ann Collins, a graduate nursing student, said.
“I hope he can make LIU stand out as the premier institution for higher education on Long Island that it has the potential to be,” Thomas Pallini, a junior political science major and class of 2019 president, said.
Burd believes that listening to students and collaborating with faculty will be key to his success. “We have a lot of great faculty and we want to support them and maximize the student experience,” he said. He plans to interact with students, including attending student events, town hall meetings to hear and address student concerns, and making himself available during new student orientation and graduation events. “I’m a very approachable person; if I’m having lunch in Hillwood and a student approaches me, I am always willing to speak with them,” he said.
Burd recently moved to Locust Valley, N.Y. with his wife and two young boys. He spends his free time with his family and at the beach. His office is located at University Center in Bush-Brown Hall. If students or faculty have concerns or questions, he is willing to make an appointment to address them directly.

Three LIU Post professors will receive the David Newton Award for Excellence in Teaching, the university’s highest teaching award. Dr. Alexander Henderson, associate professor in the department of health care and public administration, Benjamin Gerdes, assistant professor of broadcasting in the department of communications & film, and Katherine Ahern, assistant professor in the department of English, will receive the awards at a ceremony at LIU Brooklyn on April 10.
Each year, members of the campus community nominate LIU professors, and the nominations are reviewed by a campus-based Newton Awards Committee comprised of LIU Post faculty members who are previous recipients of this award.
Henderson has taught at LIU Post for seven years. He teaches undergraduate and graduate level courses in the Department of Health Care and Public Administration. He holds a Ph.D. in public administration (‘11) from Rutgers University-Newark, and an MPA (‘04) and a bachelor of arts in political science (’02) from Villanova University.
Giovanna Domingo, a senior accounting major and student government association president, is in Henderson’s administrative be the department of communications & film behavior class this semester. “I think he’s amazing; you can tell he is passionate about what he is teaching and is very engaging in class. He doesn’t just read off a powerpoint, but rather encourages class discussion,” she said.
Henderson has written over 20 publications, including articles in peer-reviewed journals, book chapters, and an edited book titled “Municipal Shared Services and Consolidation: A Public Solutions Handbook.” Before teaching at Post, he was a fire fighter and emergency medical technician for a little over 11 years, and also served as the chief administrative officer of a 9-1-1 paramedic service for three years.
“I’m humbled to receive the Newton Award. I distinctly remember hearing a previous Newtown Award winner speak at the new faculty orientation when I arrived at Post in the fall of 2011, and I was in awe of his passion and intent focus on supporting students during their time at Post. It’s been my goal to embody those same things in the classroom. I’m grateful for the support, advice, and encouragement from colleagues during my time at Post,” he said.
Gerdes has been a professor at Post for almost five years, teaching undergraduate courses, including Advance Digital Audio Production and Producing The TV Newscast. Before coming to the university, he was a professor for almost 10 years at a variety of schools, including SUNY and CUNY. He holds a bachelor of arts in modern culture and media (’03) from Brown University and an MFA (‘09) from Hunter College-CUNY. A writer, artist and organizer in the film industry, his work has been exhibited and screened at art galleries, museums and film festivals including Centre Pompidou (Paris), National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.), New Museum (New York), Museum of the Moving Image (New York), REDCAT Gallery (Los Angeles), Rotterdam International Film Festival, the Tate Modern (London), and the Robert Flaherty Film Seminar.
“I’m honored to be selected by colleagues and the institution, I feel that I’ve been supported in my efforts to make my classroom both critical and experimental spaces for my students. The support of my department and peers to be able to teach has been amazing and I’m honored for this recognition,” Gerdes said about his nomination.
Ahern has been teaching at LIU since the fall of 2012. She holds a Ph. D (‘12) in Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media (CRDM Program) from North Carolina State University, an MFA (‘07) in Creative Writing (concentration in fiction) from George Mason University, and a BA (‘04) with honors in Creative Writing with double major in Decision Science from Carnegie Mellon University.
“I moved to New York from the D.C. area specifically for the position at LIU Post. I think it’s important to have the freedom to pursue my research and teaching interest. I’m honored to teach in the English department. I feel fully supported by colleagues, and I’m fortunate to have a voice and design my own courses,” she said.
The David Newton Excellence in Teaching Awards were generously endowed in the name of Dr. David Newton, a former executive vice president of Long Island University, by former LIU trustee Abraham Krasno , according to Lori Knapp, vice president of academic a airs at LIU Post. The awards were first of-fered in 1988. The process begins at the end of October when the campus-based committee initiates the call for nominations, which are then received in November and December. The committee makes a final decision in January. The David Newton Awards for Excellence in Teaching are awarded annually.

Registration for the summer and fall 2018 classes began on March 5. There are many new courses and electives for students to enroll in. Students may meet with a promise coach or enrollment counselor, or register for classes by themselves online.
There are several new classes being offered in the Honors College in the fall semester, according to Joan Digby, Director of the Honors College. These classes are open to any student with a 3.0 GPA, not just students of the Honors College, according to Digby.
This fall the Honors College is offering Ceramics (Art 301) for the first time. “It will be a studio class and will concentrate on typical clay forms used by many civilizations and how clay has been a building material through the ages,” Digby said.
The Honors College is offering a variety of electives, including The Vikings (PHL 359) with Dr. Glenn Magee, Drones, their history and diverse uses (CMA 358) with Professor Benjamin Gerdes, Everyday Law (Health Care Administration) with Linda Vila, Esq, and a seminar on Human Connection to Music (MUS 359) with Professor Mark Shapiro. For more information and permission to register for honors courses students can speak with Dr. Digby in the Honors College office in room 202 of the Winnick House.
In the College of Health Professions and Nursing (CHPN), Dean Stacy Gropack said students can expect a new course on Outbreak Veterinary and Human Disease Emergencies (BMS 97) with Professors Tejas Bouklas and Robin Sturtz. This class will focus on “recent outbreaks, like ebola and avian influenza, and trace the path that disease detectives follow to identify, treat, and prevent further disease spread,” Gropack said. “We will cover public health, infection control, and the scientific basis of diagnosis. Students will acquire an introduction to the science of problem-solving, and the community efforts that are required to protect human and animal life,” she added.
Another new class being offered by CHPN in the fall is Social and Health Policy (HPA 16). This course, is an examination of the political processes, agencies, and policies a ecting the organization and delivery of health services in the United States.
In the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS), Dean Nathaniel Bowditch said they updated and redesigned the International Studies Major in the Department of Political Science. “It’s now a BA in International Relations and Diplomacy. We’ve added a course on diplomacy, restructured the curriculum, incorporated internship and study abroad options and decreased the total number of credits,” he said.
There is also a new Spanish minor available for Business Administration majors, and a new minor in Health and Society. The new BA in International Relations and Diplomacy is also available as a 5 year dual degree with a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA), according to Bowditch.
There are several new classes on the schedule for the fall in CLAS. In English there is ENG 59: Autobiographical Transformation and ENG 64: Crime, Guilt, and Atonement. Some older courses such as GGR1 have been revamped, Bowditch said. GGR1 is now called “The Geography of Sustainable Development” while GGR 2 is “Geography and the Global Citizen.”
The new core curriculum has opened up other possible lab courses to fulfill a core lab science such as GLY 12, Oceanography, and the new course designed for non-science majors, “Foundations of Biology: Animal Behavior” (BIO 5) “The History of Latin America 1000 – 1810” (HIS 186) and the honors philosophy course “Gods and Heroes of the Vikings,” give students a chance to explore interesting eras of the past.
Students can continue to enroll throughout the spring and summer, but again, enrolling early will provide the best options in terms of class availability,” Beth Wilkow, the University registrar said. Students with any questions regarding enrollment for classes can contact Wilkow at Registrar@liu.edu.

The annual Best of High School Journalism Awards, hosted by the Department of Communications & Film, took place on Friday, March 23 in the Tilles Center Atrium. Over 200 students from 22 high schools across Long Island, Queens, New Jersey and Connecticut participated in the awards ceremony and interactive media workshops with professors and college students.
The awards day began at 10 a.m., with the students breaking off into groups to attend five media workshops: film, radio, television, newspaper and public relations.
“I thought [the workshops] were beneficial, just talking to people – students and professors – who are involved in the field. It was hands-on in a way, in terms of giving us things to think about and talk about,” Mike Farrell, a teacher at Freeport High School and the advisor to the school newspaper, “Flashings,” said.
“I thought the ethics one [held in the Pioneer newsroom] was the best one of them all. I think it’s something kids need to know because they are so prone to just writing whatever comes to their heads and not thinking of the repercussions and how it affects other people. I think there were some things brought up that they definitely needed to hear, especially in this day and age with all that has been happening with true journalism,” Sarah Millman, a teacher at North Shore High School and the advisor to “The Viking View,” said.
At the workshop on journalism ethics, students were given a copy of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) Code of Ethics, and three ethics case scenarios to reason through. “I think they found it extremely worthwhile. I liked the fact that they felt comfortable enough to just speak up and participate; I think that was a great forum for them here,” Millman said.
James Vizza, a junior at North Shore, also found the ethics work-shop interesting. “It challenged us to think through decisions we would have to make as student journalists and it gave us a better framework for working through what we would face ethically,” he said. Vizza wants to study political science and journalism in college, and believes that these ethics skills can be applied to his career goal as a political analyst. “You need to just keep in mind the sort of concrete pillars that keep up the ethics of your work and make it credible as the truth,” he said.
Danielle Ligure, a sophomore at North Shore High School, found the radio workshop at WCWP to be the best. “I thought the speaker was very engaging and the information was very interesting. I learned the different biases that TV stations have and how to weave through them,” Ligure said.
Dustin Mandell, a senior at Lynbrook High School, found the television workshop in the TV studio in Humanities the most valuable because “the [high school student] volunteers who went up to do the gun control debate were really impressive. We learned about how we can empower young people and not be set aside from the adults, and how to give ourselves a voice, especially in journalism,” he said.
Mandell also enjoyed the journalism ethics workshop, especially with the current events. “We had a few ethics issues at our high school newspaper, so learning how to use those techniques and to see how
to not harm people but still publish what you need to do if you have stories was also valuable,” he said. “We as kids are the future and we need to learn these skills, so it’s definitely very valuable that they talk to us, and having the ethics code of conduct and using that to pursue my career will be very valuable,” Mandell said.
The awards began at 12 p.m., with opening remarks from Steven Breese, dean of the College of Arts, Communications & Design, and then a keynote address by Sandra Peddie, a veteran investigative reporter at Newsday. Over 40 students and newspapers won in categories ranging from best news story, to best photography and online publications. First place in the Best High School Newspaper category was awarded to the Hewlett Spectrum at Hewlett High School and The Phoenix at Kellenberg High School.
Photographs from the event are at www.instagram.com/liupostjournalism. High schools will be invited back to next year’s Best of High School Journalism Awards, which will be held on Friday, March 29, 2019. Information will be available at www.liu.edu/hsja soon.

The classrooms in Humanities and Pell Hall do not have locks on them, which is alarming to some faculty members and students. Students and other visitors can access classrooms and other buildings across the campus without the use of an LIU identification card. This concern arises after the Feb. 14 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
“Not only is it a danger that students and professors are unable to lock classroom doors from the inside, but also it’s crucial that doors open inwards towards the classroom, rather than outwards towards the hall-way,” Morgan Kashinsky, a junior criminal justice major, said. “That is imperative because, should a student be unable to lock a door due to lack of locking mechanism or malfunction, the door must be barricaded. If the door opens to the outside, how can students block the door?”
These concerns have been raised to campus facilities services and public safety. Roy Fergus, director of facilities services for LIU Post and Brooklyn, said that the concerns are being addressed.
As part of the detailed security review after the shooting in Parkland, LIU administrators have conducted a detailed assessment of the current safety and security profile on the campuses, according to Fergus. “We have checked every classroom door, fire and safety zones,” he said. “Based on this effort, we intend to design and implement upgrades to all doors around campus, based on preserving and ensuring the safety of students and staff, as well as lessons learned concerning these type of events,” .
Fergus and the team at facilities services are moving quickly to assess the cost the university will incur, the scheduling of when this will happen and other procurement related issues to determine the best course of action to implement these changes.
Nothing is set in stone. Fergus estimates within 30 days – after the semester ends – the changes will be complete. “There will be a concrete course of action to ensure the safety of students.

Materials:
Multi color modeling clay
Wooden roller (optional)
Decorative plastic cup or small basket
Any small, decorative Easter themed items (i.e chick or rabbit toy) Colorful mesh material or plastic grass
For those who don’t want to use actual eggs on Easter but still want to participate in Easter crafting, this is an easy, vegan way to “dye eggs.” First, use the modeling clay to mold an egg. Using a light color clay as the base, slowly build on it to form an egg-like shape. Then, thinly roll out the colored clay and press the edges of the colorful clays together. This will create the appearance of dipping the egg into colored water. Often, dip dying an egg leads to the colors running together.
Finally, display your egg in a decorative Easter scene.
For example, the photo features a cup and small chick as a display.
There is no limit to the number of eggs to make; the scene can also be created in an Easter basket.

Easter is a time to be around family, enjoy chocolate, and take the time to reflect on the life of Jesus and thank him for what he has done for us. Catholic Easter is celebrated this Sunday, April 1 and Orthodox Easter is celebrated next Sunday, April 7.
If you are on campus for Easter, you can gather some of your friends on campus and either go out for dinner at a nearby restaurant or make your own Easter dinner. After, you can go to the interfaith chapel at 8 p.m. for Easter mass.
For students who want to celebrate Easter off campus, there are plenty of activities. What is Easter without an Easter egg hunt? You can attend the Annual Easter egg hunt hosted by Think & Fun NYC, in Riverside Park in Manhattan. Your siblings or children can enjoy the wonders of finding eggs filled with candy. Spend the day helping young ones find the eggs scattered around the park, and give them the bragging rights of collecting the most eggs. The event is on March 31 and costs $40 per person.
If egg hunting is not your style, try an Easter cruise. The cruise sets off from Sky-port Marina, and makes its way up the East River. Enjoy some music and the city skyline with your partner or friends. This event will be on Saturday, March 31 and Sunday, April 1, at 11 a.m. and is $30 per person.
Along with Easter egg hunts and egg races, people also find time to build on worship. Many people attend church services with their family and friends to remember Jesus and his sacrifice.
Also on Easter, movies about the Bible reemerge on to TV screens such as “The Ten Commandments,” featuring the late Charlton Heston, “The Passion of Christ,” created by Mel Gibson, and “The Robe” featuring the late Richard Burton.
Whether on campus or off campus, Easter is a time to celebrate Jesus dying for us and rising from the dead to save us.

On April 18, Full House Organic, a nearby organic restaurant, will launch a new dietician assisted meal plan service and a certified dietician will be available between noon and 7 p.m. to speak with customers. The “Organic Overhaul” will allow customers to create three, five and seven day meal plans in an effort to promote healthy and clean eating.
Located only two miles away from LIU Post, Full House Organic is a 100 percent certified organic restaurant.
It’s no secret that food allergies and sensitivities are increasingly prevalent among college students. In fact, according to the Food and Allergy Research and Education Center, over 15 million Americans suffer from food allergies, with 30 percent of these individuals having allergies to multiple foods. This is a 50 percent increase in allergy prevalence since the year 1997.
The owner of Full House Organic, Judy Racz, moved to Long Island from Manhattan and immediately found it more difficult to feed her four children, especially one who has a learning disability and reacts acutely to pesticides and artificial foods, truly organic produce. Her frustration of feeding her family foods that claimed to be organic but weren’t, mixed with the extreme lack of organic food providers in the area, led her to open Full House Organic in Jan. 2017.
The restaurant had an earthy, open vibe and is filled with colorful dishes and succulent aromas. At first, it seems too good to be true, but after talking with Racz and hearing about how passionate she was about clean, organic and tasty foods, my mind was turned.
“Organic, fresh foods shouldn’t be bland,” Racz said, “and households nowadays are filled with multiple types of eaters- vegans, carnivores, gluten free, allergy sufferers-and Full House Organic was really made so that everyone is able to find a place to eat without taking harmful substances into the body.”
As well as each and every ingredient in Full House Kitchen being organic, only reverse osmosis purified water is used in the kitchen, and foods are only served on compostable plates and glass jars free of other harmful substances like BPA.
On the topic of pesticides, Racz is a believer that their use in modern agriculture has the potential to affect college students. “You are exactly what you eat, and when you eat organic you’re going to feel more energetic, have more focus, and generally perform better. Organic produce allows the body to absorb vitamins and minerals more fully and so would definitely have a positive effect on the college community.”
Full House Organic is located at 38 Glen Cove Road in Greenvale. They offer a free delivery service through their app or website.

The LIU Post Wind Symphony will take a trip Down Under to perform alongside ensembles from across the globe from June 29 to July 10. The wind symphony is led by Dr. James McRoy, director of wind studies, and is composed of 66 musicians. Graduate and undergraduate students, alumni and high schoolers will perform together under the name Long Island Symphonic Winds for the first time. “It’s a unique title, made up of different populations,” McRoy said.
The LI Symphonic Winds will be one of only two American groups to perform. “The list of ensembles performing is a real variety,” McRoy said. There will be ensembles representing countries as far as China, Australia and Japan. KaraAnn Leone, graduate assistant and flutist, is excited for the adventure in Australia.
This is Leone’s second year in the music performance graduate degree program. Her first tour with the wind symphony was to Puerto Rico during summer of 2015, as she simultaneously worked to complete her undergraduate degree in music education. “[It was] a lot of just ‘go with the flow,’ and adjust when we got there, so we kind of knew what to expect,” Leone said, “But it was really successful and we all had a great time.”
Each summer, McRoy chaperones a new ensemble of students abroad to perform at some of the world’s most acclaimed stages. The wind symphony’s upcoming 2018 performance will be in Sydney, Australia where they will perform at the Sydney Opera House and other venues such as the Darling Harbour. Leone is humbled by the opportunity to travel and play on a prestigious stage. “I’ve always wanted to go to Australia, and I didn’t think I’d ever be able to,” she said. “I’m really looking forward to just being there. Performing at the Sydney Opera House there is like performing at Carnegie Hall here, and it’s a dream come true.”

The wind symphony went on their first tour in 2009 and have since performed in Poland, the Czech Republic and China. Bobby and Sam Stainkamp have attended all three of the wind symphony’s previous tours. The alumni reside in Long Island after both graduating with undergraduates degrees in music education (2010), and a graduates degree in music theory and composition (2012). Mr. and Mrs. Stainkamp have fond memories of their past tours and are excited about the upcoming one. “We get to experience a lot of nice places’ performers,” Mrs. Stainkamp said, “Laced into that, besides a couple of performances, we get to experience another culture and learn about life there.”
Over the span of 12 days, the group will tour Sydney, and they will perform three concerts. The first will take place at the renowned Sydney Opera House. The next will be at the Darling Harbour, an outdoor venue known for its concerts and festivals. The ensemble’s nal performance will take place at the Sydney Town Hall theatre, a venue McRoy describes as a “high end concert hall.”
“When we went to Poland, every single concert that we put on was sold out; there was not an empty seat,” Mr. Stainkamp said. “They had people sitting on the floor in the front.”
Two of the 2018 concerts are shared with other ensembles, and the LI Symphonic Winds will occupy the stage for 30 to 40 minutes. Along with performing on their trip, the ensemble will partake in two workshops led by Australian conductor and composer David Stanhope. Working with a composer from the area artists are performing in, gives the musicians an experience of a different culture, according to Leone. “You feel more attached to it and really understand where they are coming from once we are able to actually see things for our self,” she said.
Rehearsals for an event of this scale start early, so the students and alumni participating will begin meeting at the beginning of May.
Before the ensemble leaves for Australia, they will perform a send-off concert on Wednesday, June 27 at 7:30 p.m. Although no venue is set, the event will be free and open to the public. Dr. McRoy will release the information once finalized.

Professional cartoonist Joe Dator will share insight about his work during a discussion and presentation on March 29. His works have appeared in prints including the “New Yorker,” “Mad Magazine” and “Esquire Magazine.”
“I’m going to show a selection of my cartoons from the ‘New Yorker’ and talk about their inspiration, and why some were published and others were not,” Dator said. He will also delve into the humour process and what goes on behind the scenes of a gag cartoon. “It’s going to be funny,” he said. With 12 years of experience, Dator’s event will provide a glance into what a successful cartoonist does and the work that goes into the job.
This event will be a unique and humorous experience as students learn what is involved in creating a cartoon. Many of Dator’s cartoons contain satirical political messages. His presentation may appeal to student artists interested in visual and graphic arts as a potential career path. Journalism students may also find relevance in cartooning since illustrations are largely prevalent in newspapers and online news sites.
The presentation will take place on Thursday, March 29 from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. in the Life Science building, room 242. One merit credit is available for students attending from the honors college, and free pizza will be served.

The international artists of the “Celtic Woman Homecoming Tour” will make a stop at the Tilles Center. This female Irish group will bring their unique take on classical songs to campus.
Celtic Woman is known to please the ears of audiences with their traditional music of yesterday and today. From original songs to covers such as You Raise Me Up, Amazing Grace, O’ America, and Ave Maria, the group has gained a large fanbase with their unique talents. The group currently consists of Máiréad Carlin, Susan McFadden, Éabha McMahon, and Tara McNeill.
Having undergone several member changes since 2010, Celtic Woman has had members come and go, looking to tackle other projects. The newest member, Tara McNeill, joined the group during summer 2017, and contributes her talents as a violinist, harpist and soprano vocalist to the group.
Gillian Cohen, sophomore public relations major is familiar with the group. “Honestly, I don’t listen to them, but I’ve heard of them. Other members of the LIU community are excited and know the group well,” Cohen said.
“The Celtic women have a beautifully smooth voice that touches your soul and uplifts your heart spiritually,” Lisa Jenkins, a junior broadcasting major said, “One of my favorite songs they remade is ‘Amazing Grace’, which I love so much.”
Tilles Center staff is unsure of the number of songs the artists will perform, but they are certain it will be a night filled with excitement.
The homecoming tour began on March 24, and the group will travel across the world to New York, London, Toronto, Houston, and Las Vegas. The concert will begin at 7:30 p.m. on March 29. Ticket prices range from $103 to $43 and can be purchased online at www.tillescenter.org or by visiting the box office. Discounted student tickets are available, contact the box office at (516) 299-3100 for more details.

A single person makes up a small part of a large world, but what does it look like when each person’s life is placed before a photographer’s lens? From March 20 to March 24, Wenkai Ji, a senior photography major, displayed original photographs from his collection, “The Ants.”
The exhibition contained 15 prints that Ji captured with a simple film camera. The pieces showcased the everyday people in New York City doing things like riding the subway or having a meal outside. The collection’s name is inspired by, “The people who live in New York City, they are never taking a break,” Ji said. “In this charming and giant city, people do what they should do, I call them ‘The Ants.’”
Ji completed the project over the course of two semesters. The collection is a mix of both black and white and full color prints. He walked the streets of New York City and took photos of whatever movements and people interested him. “When people walk on the street, they just go forward. They don’t look around or think about very much,” Ji said. He was drawn to photographing people because only they can control their movements, and he enjoys the natural fluidity that the human body possesses.
Ji considers Allison Rufrano, an adjunct professor of art, one of his biggest mentors on campus, and he attributes his artistic growth to her support. “She gave me a lot of ideas to help me build up myself, not only [regarding] technical stuff, but with my ideas,” Ji said. Initially, visual art didn’t come naturally to Ji, he first found interest in the camera’s ability to capture eternal images of his closest family and friends. “I didn’t like art at all before I started learning about it,” he said, “The more and more skills I learn and galleries I visit, the more I can see art’s influence in life.”
Within the collection, the photograph named “The Girl” is Ji’s favorite. “The photo is not perfect, there is no focus on this woman,” he said. The piece was the first photo Ji captured as he walked the streets of New York City. “She was the first person I took a photograph of close enough, the result made me so excited,” Ji said.
Ji’s fellow classmates attended the show’s reception on March 22 to support Ji and his work. “Over his years at this school he has perfected his style; he has great photography and has showcased it,” Erin Bortell, a junior photography major said.
Overall, Ji is not sure what his path in life would be if he hadn’t chosen photography, but he feels that photography and art have improved his quality of life.

Sophomore, criminal justice major Alyssa Mallery led the way for the Pioneers women’s lacrosse team when they beat University of New Haven 16-15 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex on March 13. The 20-year-old mid fielder from Wantagh, NY had a career best of six goals on ten shots.
Lacrosse has been a part of Mallery’s life for about 12 years, and it means a lot for her to play with all of her friends and watch them succeed. When asking Mallery about her own performance in their last game she pointed out that the team’s effort and success is more important than her own. “I think everyone contributed to the win we had against New Haven. It’s a great feeling to score, but I was happier knowing that everyone worked hard to earn that win,” Mallery said.
Mallery’s humble attitude and willingness to work hard is something that is well known by the team’s coach Meghan McNamara. “Alyssa is a team player that is a piece to our success. She has a heart and work ethic that is never questioned. You just see it when she steps foot on the field in practice and in games. She is an unselfish player that is all about this team,” McNamara said.
Coach McNamara also described Mallery as a dominant piece to their offensive side who always is a threat to their opponents. McNamara emphasized that the mid fielder position that Mallery plays is great off the draw to gain their possessions, and that it gives the team opportunities to score. Mallery herself agrees, “I enjoy being on the circle for the draw because I use my speed to gain possession of the ball.”
This is Mallery’s second year as a player on the Pioneers women’s lacrosse team. Last year, the team won the East Coast Conference Championships, an achievement that she sees as her best memory as a Pioneer.
Looking forward to the rest of their season, Mallery says that she sees a team that will succeed. “We still have some things to improve on, but I believe that we will have a very successful year.”

With the women’s equestrians regular season coming to an end, 12 of their 28 riders have successfully qualified for the zone championships at the Bergen County Equestrian Center in Leonia, N.J. on April 8. The team finished its regular season on March 18 in Selden, N.Y. at the Olde Towne Equestrian Center. The equestrians finished in first place in the regional standings.
The women’s equestrian team has had a long year. Their first show dates back to Oct. 1. Fast forward to late March, how does all of the training and riding affect the teammates?
“A lot of us have lower back pain because we have to arch our backs and force our shoulders back,” Katie Galvin, a sophomore nursing major said.
Since equestrian is a fall and spring sport, the team has to make sure that they continue to ride and train throughout the year. One of the exercises that they do is yoga or pilates. “Individually, a lot of us workout everyday on our own, but we only have two mandatory workouts. I do a lot of yoga, but our team workouts include cardio, strength and yoga,” Galvin said.
The team has its own training facility at the stables on campus. The stables house approximately 27 horses, which includes both the equestrian team horses and privately owned horses.
The Pioneers’ next show will be their last for the year, on Sunday, April 8 in Leonia, N.J. at the zone championships.
