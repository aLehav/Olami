Katherine Hill-Miller, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at LIU Post since July 2002, will be stepping down from her position and transitioning back into her previous role as an English professor. Dean Hill-Miller has been a professor for more than 30 years. Nicholas Ramer, Assistant Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, who has worked for Dean Hill-Miller since 2009, will become the acting dean of the college effective June 1.
Hill-Miller has been a dean at Post for 13 years. Prior to becoming dean, Hill-Miller has written two books; one about author Mary Shelley, an English novelist best known for her gothic novel “Frankstein,” and the other about author Virginia Woolf, an English writer and modernist.
She was an english literature professor at C.W. Post, now LIU Post, since 1980, assistant professor at the College of William and Mary in Virginia for three years, and was also a guest lecturer at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in the Federal Republic of Germany, where she discussed English Literature as well as American Feminism.
According to Hill-Miller, there are many responsibilities that come with being a dean. She said she has tasks that range from student difficulties to budgets to curriculum concerns. Hill-Miller said one of the most interesting things during her time as dean was the closure of the LIU Southampton campus. The campus was struggling financially, and the administration had come to the unfortunate conclusion to close the campus in 2005.
According to the dean, although unfortunate, the closure of the campus brought wonderful educational advances to the Post campus. Along with physical equipment from labs, Post gained a fabulous faculty, according to Hill-Miller. Ten years later, she said the faculty that once taught at the Southampton campus has assimilated swiftly and smoothly into the Pioneer community.
“Working with such a diverse group of people is both interesting and challenging,” Hill-Miller said. As dean, Hill-Miller said that she has found herself acting as an intermediary. She said she would constantly have to convert jargon used by admissions voicing their concerns into language that the faculty would appreciate and vice versa. The dean said that at the end of the day, however, everyone was on the absolute same page; the most important concern being the students of LIU Post and their education.
Hill-Miller said that her first love has always been teaching. She said she is excited to get back into the classroom and teach English seminars to incoming freshmen. Hill-Miller is equally passionate about having time to write once again. Having already published two books, Hill-Miller has not published another book since her promotion. Sitting on story ideas spanning 13 years, Hill-Miller is thrilled that she will have time to start her next book.
Hill-Miller said she is both sad and excited about her retirement as dean. She said she is sad because she will no longer work everyday with the wonderful people that she has been working directly with for so many years. Although this is true, Hill-Miller will still be just upstairs, in the English department, from her current office in the Winnick Mansion.
Nicholas Ramer, incoming Acting Dean and current Assistant Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, graduated LIU Post in 1994, and became a chemistry professor in 2000. Ramer said he is looking forward to his new position. “It’s a very exciting time at LIU and more specifically at LIU Post,” Ramer said. “The faculty of the college is developing new programs and opportunities for our students. As acting dean, I will share in their enthusiasm for providing the best education for our students.” Ramer said he is truly fortunate to work with such a dynamic group of educators and scholars, not only in the college, but also across the entire campus.
“Dr. Nicholas Ramer, gifted chemist and teacher, has served as the Associate Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for the last six years,” said Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffery Kane. “Over those years he has acquired a deep and rich understanding of its programs and faculty, enabling him to guide the strategic development of the college as a whole. Being [an] alumni of the college, he also has a unique insight into, and appreciation for, its students.”

Brookville Hall’s side doors, which were previously unalarmed and have been an issue in the past, are now alarmed. This is the latest precautionary step taken by LIU Post administration in order to ensure a safer campus.
In the beginning of the semester, an online course about sexual abuse and sexual harassment was issued to all students in an effort to increase awareness on the topics. The top priority and number one reason behind alarming the doors is to ensure safety. This is obvious protocol, but not one being taken lightly by Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life.
“Safety is our main goal in the residence halls. These alarms allow us to secure the side doors so that they cannot be left propped open or used as an entrance for non- residents to enter the building,” Berthel explained.
While Brookville is the only residence hall that is currently equipped with the side-door alarm system, Berthel says that other residence halls may have them installed in the near future as well. “We will continue to evaluate the need for additional alarms, and install them in residence halls when we feel that it is in the best interest of the building and community.” The alarms are equipped with cameras similar to those that are in Hillwood, the library, and  all around campus. This initiative, while new on LIU grounds, is not unusual, as plenty of other universities have taken similar steps in order to maintain a safer environment for students living on campus.
Berthel also addressed how he thinks the new system might affect students. “We hope that students understand how this helps create a safer community for them. The health and safety of LIU students, faculty, and staff remains our top priority.”
However, some students do not agree. “I don’t think the system is a good idea because I feel that the school can spend money on other things to make the school more modern,” said C.J. Sears, a sophomore Broadcasting major. “Students are still going to use the side door regardless.”
Fellow sophomore Nicholas Laspina, a Physical Education major, agreed. “The alarms will be an inconvenience for a while until people are used to them being there. I think the initiative is good in theory, but will not be effective in stopping people from going back and forth.”
Doors can be alarmed and locked, but safety comes down to proper judgement and decision-making.

Next year, there will be two new food additions on campus: The Bleeker Street Café and Twisted Taco.
Twisted Taco will share space with Subway on the first floor of Hillwood Commons. Aramark food service will operate Twisted Taco, and the menu has not yet been determined. Paul Carroll, Director of Operations for Aramark, said that the concept was added because he is aware that restaurants such as Moe’s and Chipotle are popular among students, and believes that Twisted Taco will attract many students.
The Bleeker Street Café will be located in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library. The menu for the café will be operated by Aramark, and the specific location has not yet been determined since plans for the vendor are still in the works. Carroll said that the two additions are being added in order, “to provide students with quality, convenience, value and variety.”
“Each year, dining services sets a budget with the goal of continuing to enhance the dining program with new concepts, brands, and events, as well as cover operational costs, such as food, labor, equipment, and renovations,” Carroll added.
Carroll also explained why The Bleeker Street Café and Twisted Taco were chosen as the new additions. “We survey students each semester and use their feedback across our operations,” he said. “We work with the Student Government Association’s food committee, the Student’s Athletic Advisory committee, Aramark’s Voice of the Customer, as well as host periodic ‘Chef’s Table’ events for students to give us feedback regarding our services.”
Jae Hun Moon, a sophomore Economics major, is happy to learn about the new upcoming additions. “It’s a great idea to open a café in the library. Especially since Starbucks is always so crowded and has a long line. I hope the café is going to have more tea options.”
Abagail Van Vlerah did not respond to The Pioneer’s request for a comment from the administration.

Emily R. Lehrman, a librarian, editor and translator who served on the LIU Post faculty for 28 years, passed away after heart surgery on Jan. 13, at North Shore Hospital. She was 91.
With editorial skills that surpass many native-English speakers, Emily became a resource to everyone who knew her, according to her oldest son, Leonard Lehrman.
Emily grew up in the Soviet Union before moving to the U.S. at age 12 with her mother. With no knowledge of the English language, Emily started from scratch, and eventually obtained a college degree at Simmons University in Mass., graduating with honors on a full scholarship.
She continued to stride along the educational path, earning a masters in Russian literature at Columbia University before working as a secretary for the department chair at the time, Ernest J. Simmons, following graduation, and later the American Soviet Medical Society.
Emily taught Russian at Adelphi College before heading back to the school bench to pick up a second masters in library science at C.W. Post. Eventually, the doors to the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library opened up, and Emily came back to spend 28 years as a member of the faculty at the university, most of that time in the Instructional Media Center (IMC), where she has left her mark.
“She was organized, exacting, and detailed,” said Diane Podell, a colleague from the Periodicals department. “Nothing escaped her!”
Manju Prasad-Rao, head of the IMC, nodded in agreement. Like many others, she couldn’t help but make use of Emily’s proofreading talent. “My head could only rest content if I had shown her my work,” she said.
Word on Emily’s abilities rapidly spread to other departments in the library, “Perhaps we librarians came to depend on her too much — perhaps we even imposed on her generosity and linguistic abilities,” said Louis Pisha, a colleague from the reference department. “But she never so much as hinted that the rest of us might heed her excellent example and work harder on cultivating our own relatively meager compositional and editorial skills.”
Perhaps the explanation behind her clarity and simplicity with words came from Emily’s expressive manners with her mother Sima, who was deaf, her son Leonard remarked. Perhaps it was just as simple as it was complex — a lesson worth remembering.
“She would not just change things, but she would explain why she changed it,” said Maria Zarycky, a librarian at IMC, hinting that Emily, unlike many Americans, actually had to pay attention to learn the grammar correctly since it differed greatly from the Russian she grew up with.
But Emily’s critical eye for mistakes and clarification as an editor did not equate with her demeanor. “She was very fair to people, sometimes almost to a fault,” Pisha said. “She did try to find the good side in what people did and what they said, and she was unfailingly polite in her approach.”
When conversing with her colleagues at IMC, Emily would always make sure to follow up on everybody’s well being. “She even asked how my family was doing, and made sure to know my family members by name, even better than I sometimes,” said Jean O’Neill-Uhl, who has now taken over Emily’s job at IMC.
Despite being courteous, Emily was also a woman full of own expressions. Her artistry within music and literature, with countless poetic translations, has continuously bled through her family’s veins. Emily was also very politically active, bringing her children along to anti- war demonstrations in the early ‘60s. The whole family continued to participate in demonstrations throughout ensuing decades, according to Leonard.
At work, however, it was another story, or often so, no stories at all. “Emily was multi-dimensional,” Zarycky said. “She had a lot of interests, and her job was very important to her, but I don’t think it defined her sometimes as much as people’s jobs define them.”
Despite being a hard worker, Emily was always home when the kids came back from school, according to Leonard Lehrman. His brother agreed. “She wanted to know everything I was doing, and explain to her even the most advanced technologies I was working with,” Paul Lehrman said. “Although one thing she could never grasp, and she asked me repeatedly, was why anyone would need an iPad.”
Her sons believe Emily’s multi-faceted agenda was really based on one particular idea. “Along with her loyalty, her ability to cope, and her love of knowledge and books, my mother had one overwhelming character trait: she wanted to be useful,” Paul Lehrman said.
Leonard Lehrman traced the roots of her heritage to find an explanation. Rejecting any religious beliefs, he described his mother as a humanist with grounds as a secular Jew, somewhat distilled through her Russian socialist background. “She was always asking people, ‘You can’t just be against everything, what are you for?’” he said.
She is survived by husband Nathaniel Lehrman, sons Leonard and Paul Lehrman, daughter Betty Lehrman, and her grandchildren.
An excerpt from Paul Lehrman’s memorial speech reads, “When I was about five, and going through perhaps my first existential crisis,
I asked her, “Mommy, why are we here?” And her answer, without hesitation, was, ‘To help other people.’ I took that in for a second and then said, ‘But why are THEY here?’” She just laughed.”
Upcoming events in Emily Lehrman’s memory:
A lecture/seminar on Jewish Opera at the Community Church, 40 E. 35th St., Manhattan:
– Wednesday, Apr. 22, on the Holocaust at 2 – 3:30 p.m.
– Wednesday, May 13, on Emma Goldman (75th anniversary commemoration of her death) at 2 – 3:30 p.m.
Songs of Conscience performed by The Metropolitan Philharmonic Chorus:
– Sunday, Oct. 18, 2:30 p.m. at Freeport Memorial Library, 144 W. Merrick Rd., Freeport, N.Y.
– Sunday, Nov. 1, 2:30 p.m. at Bryant Library, Paper Mill Rd., Roslyn, N.Y.

The campus radio station, WCWP, will be re-hosting another hunt with the help of LIU Promise. Teams of four had to register at the radio station by March 26. However, the actual event will run from March 30 to April 2. The winning team will be announced during WCWP’s Midday Madness program on Monday, April 6. Each member of the winning team will be rewarded a $100 gift card.
Program director and assistant station manager of WCWP, Christina Kay, believes the scavenger hunt is a good way to promote student participation on campus. “What’s great is that we get our name out there. We have station members participating, but a lot of the other clubs, groups, and Greek life organizations on campus are also getting involved with it,” Kay said.
This event is a way to have students explore their own campus, and go to areas where they wouldn’t normally go. Along with campus participation, students will also have an opportunity to boost their school’s image on social media. “They’re having fun, and using this hunt as an excuse to go on Instagram and post pictures,” Kay added.
In order to get other students to participate, the WCWP staff encourages their students to reach to people they know in other clubs and organizations on campus in hopes that people will find the idea appealing.
Kay also gave credit to Samantha Augustine, the public relations director at WCWP. “She was really the one who took the reigns on coming up with the scavenger hunt [last year].” Kay said that Augustine created the list of activities for the scavenger hunt, and planned for the event with Dan Cox, the WCWP station manager.
“They came up with the design of the shirts, and the hashtags the students would use on social media [to mark their findings],” she said.
Samantha Negron, a sophomore Broadcasting major, participated in last year’s scavenger hunt, and registered with a team to do so again this semester. Negron first heard about the scavenger hunt through her membership with the station at their monthly meetings. She also has had to promote the event on her Midday Madness Program at the radio station, which has only made her more excited for the event.
Working at the station made Negron’s decision to participate even easier, especially since it’s creating a friendly rivalry between her friends at the station. “I just want to beat the sports department and my boyfriend who are on the same team. I thought it would make for a funny competition,” Negron said.
Negron also believes participating in the scavenger hunt is a great way of connecting with others. “Students should join because they will get involved on campus, they get to bond with friends, perhaps increase Instagram followers, and ultimately have the opportunity to win $100 each. Who doesn’t like free money?”
When commenting on the overall experience of the scavenger hunt, Kay explained that it is just fun to see the way people interact with one another. “I was actually really blown away with the creativity people would put into their pictures from last year’s hunt. There were people who joined groups and didn’t know their teammates prior to the hunt, so for them it was just a fun way to socialize and meet people.”
To witness the scavenger hunt activities, head over to the WCWP radio station between March 30 and April 2. You can also look for updates on their Instagram account.

The Department of Public Safety has an escort service on campus to provide students with a service that allows them to reserve an escort to travel with them on campus at night. The service is staffed by students and is available Monday through Thursday from 6 p.m. to midnight, and on Fridays from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., with the exception of holidays and intersessions. The escort service started “between 1995 and 1997,” according to Paul Rappes, Director of Public Safety. However, many students are unaware that the service even exists.
Richard Renelique, a junior Broadcasting major, has worked as a Public Safety escort for six months. “I will bring students to their cars or dorms if they feel unsafe,” said Renelique, who found the paid position through JobNet. He works three times a week, and has assisted five students during his time as an escort.
The Public Safety page of the LIU Post website explains the service. “The Department of Public Safety at LIU Post is dedicated to providing a safe and secure campus environment for the students, staff, faculty, and visitors of the community it serves. To meet this goal, the Department of Public Safety provides a free walking escort service.
The escort service is available to all students, staff, faculty and visitors [of] the campus. The escort service is designed to enhance campus members’ safety and peace of mind if they must walk after dark. The primary goal of the escort service is to enable members to travel from one campus location to another with a greater sense of security.”
Of 11 students recently interviewed by The Pioneer about the service, six said they knew about it and five were unaware of the escort service. Deandre Wilson, a senior Broadcasting major, learned about the service through the Campus Concierge in Hillwood. “It’s a great idea because it gives students protection from dangerous situation[s],” Wilson said.
According to Renelique, the escort service “has still been active in the freezing cold.” Renelique explained that the service isn’t used very often and that the “word needs to be spread.”
To arrange for an escort, students can call 516-299-2200 from any campus phone or use one of the many blue light emergency phones located throughout the campus. When calling to arrange an escort, students must provide their name, exact location, and their destination.

Would you believe that an award-winning professor at LIU Post thinks that, “Sometimes a B is ok?” Would you also believe that this same person worked several odd jobs, including as a waitress, a baby sitter, and a bartender as she worked her way through school?
Dr. Linda Vila is an Assistant Professor of Health Care & Public Administration in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and a winner of the 2015 David Newton Award for Excellence in Teaching.
When Vila said, “sometimes a B is ok,” she was referring to how in certain circumstances it was difficult to manage all of her school work and her job while in school. She attended Hunter College as an Honor major and an English major, followed by Brooklyn Law School where she received her Juris Doctorate. Fast forward a couple of decades, now Vila is on the other side of the coin.
Vila has won teaching awards within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and, at the entire university level, expects the same effort from her students.
“I expect students to be prepared. I understand I have a reputation, don’t come into my class without reading,” Vila said. She teaches several undergraduate and graduate classes, including, legal aspects of health care, health care management, and administrative responsibility in health care. Although Vila might be stickler for attendance, it’s for good reason.
“As a lawyer, if I’m late for court the judge is going to chastise me, and it will cost my client money that I’m late,” Vila said. Although she understands that class is not a courtroom, she attempts to make students aware of the work environment. One of her main exercises is a mock trial, in which every student is assigned a role in the case, and then the trial is played out in class.
In addition to in class work, Vila believes in field training as well. “If you’re going to be running an emergency room and you’ve never [seen] one in your life, how are you going to be the manager of it?” Vila asked. This past fall semester, she took her students to Nassau University Medical Center to get a chance to see some of the things that they talk about during class.
This varied method of teaching is what earned her the Newton Award. According to liu.edu, the award is based on “presentation, attitude, expectations of students, and professional development and knowledge.”
Vila has been at Post in varied capacities since 1996, such as working in the dean’s office, adjunct professor, and full-time professor. She only returned as a full-time professor in 2013. Vila gave up on her last high-ranking job as a senior vice president in general counsel at a healthcare network because, “I had a greater passion for teaching,” she said. This is a trait she picked up on in her career.
Vila often trained new physicians as they were getting accustomed. Vila also taught at Stanley Kaplan Test Prep while she was going to Brooklyn Law School. Although Vila has had several jobs to this point she finds comfort in teaching, and has described it as “a natural transition.”

Steve Liebling, a professor in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, is the winner of the 2014 Buchalter Cosmology Prize. This prize was created by Dr. Ari Buchalter to spur new cosmology research.
Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. Submitters enter papers they have written or nominate the work of other authors. Liebling co-authored, with Carroll Wainwright, Matthew Johnson, Hiranya Peiris, Anthony Aguirre, and Luis Lehner, the paper that was nominated, titled “Simulating the Universe(s): from Cosmic Bubble Collisions to Cosmological Observables with Numerical Relativity.”
This paper is built upon the theory that our universe is one among many in a multiverse. Liebling and his co-authors presented the idea that another universe collided with ours billions of years ago. Through their research, they were able to quantify effects that experiments would be able to search for to potentially provide evidence for another universe’s existence.
Liebling began this project when he was on sabbatical in Canada, during the 2012 spring semester, and continued working on it while participating in a Cambridge University workshop with Stephen Hawking in March 2014. “The award is a nice feather-in-my-cap and it’s always nice to be recognized for one’s work,” Liebling said.
Liebling graduated from Brown University as a physics major. Since Liebling could remember, he has been fascinated by cosmology and black holes. He didn’t think he would become a physics teacher at first.
“When I was graduating college, I sought out various jobs (computer programmer, high school teacher, etc.) at the same time I was applying to physics Ph.D. programs,” Liebling said. “I didn’t get any jobs, so off to graduate school I went, at the University of Texas at Austin.” After graduating from the University of Texas, he decided to become a physics teacher.
At LIU Post, Liebling teaches intro and advanced physics classes, and occasionally the honors astronomy course. He doesn’t quote one specific class as his favorite, because it all boils down to the students’ involvement.
“I am not sure that students appreciate how much their participation and questions really affect how enjoyable the class is,” he said. His favorite classes are those in which the students share their genuine curiosity with him and their peers.
Post students enrolled in Liebling’s courses find the subject fascinating. David Mannlein, a senior Math major, took university physics 1 with Liebling. “A three hour lecture has the potential to be insufferable, but we were always laughing and joking. It kept the class engaging,” Mannlein said.
Because of Liebling’s enthusiastic teaching, Mannlein perceived the physical world in a different light. “I remember how I would go to work after class and see the concepts we learned in class all around me,” he said. One question he posed as an example was, why does the fridge door always bounce back and close on you when you swing it open? The physics answer would be Newton’s Third Law and Conservation of Momentum.
Rebecca Phillips, a senior Math major who has a minor in physics, has taken Physics 3, 4, and 19 with Liebling. She noted that Liebling helped her grow as a person and student. “He recommended me for the physics tutor position in the math lab, and that job made me want to minor in physics!” she said.
Liebling conducts a lot of research on different topics throughout the year. The primary goal of his research is to better comprehend the merging of neutron stars and black holes. “High energy collision that requires a lot of physics is very complicated,” he said. Despite the difficulties of researching this topic, Liebling is optimistic that once the first detection of gravitational waves occurs in the U.S., there will be more interest and excitement in the fields he focuses on.
Liebling enjoyed the research he has conducted, although he noted one paper to be his favorite, focusing on what the collision of two black holes immersed in an external magnetic field would look like. Liebling and his co-authors made a fascinating discovery: the collision produces two jets that spiral together like a barber pole as the black holes merge into one. This discovery was titled “Dual Jets from Binary Black Holes,” and released in the 2010 Science Magazine, Volume 329.

When I study, I like to be in an extremely specific environment. I usually have to be in my bedroom at the 22 Murray “bachelor pad” in Hicksville. I have to have a specific type of music on, depending on what work I am doing. I also prefer no distractions from anyone! But the various sounds coming from my roommate Mr. Sebastian Baxter, and the wailing song ‘The Free Love Freeway’ coming from my other roommate Alfred ‘Johan’ Lindberg, make it a difficult atmosphere to come by.
If I get these three main requirements, I can smash through my revision and essays in a couple of hours, ready to commence my session of Spartacus.
However, many of my housemates and friends work in a totally different atmosphere. For example, Oliver Hollingsaeter, a freshman Economics major, can easily concentrate and get through piles of work in the living room of our house, even though he is chuckling at the classic comedy of “Friends” along with me. I only wish to be able to switch off all distractions and just be able to work, but for me, it simply doesn’t happen like that.
To be fair, I have gotten much better at it since my first semester in college. I have now started to study at the infamous LIU Post Library. There, I am developing a tolerance for the distractions of the sniffles and sneezes that the archive of books has to offer.
One way in which I cancel out the sounds of the library is by listening to the ‘immense’ ability of all that British underground, deep house DJs I love –which by the way, all the Scandinavian boys believe it’s bizarre when I put a bit of bass on the way to 7 a.m. practice, unless its Kygo, of course– or I listen to the majestic guitar-playing of John Mayer, which means I can’t actually hear any of the distractions anyway.
The funny thing is, the reason I took the conquest of studying to the school library in the first place was because many of my friends find it much easier to study in a library type of environment, and psychology does prove that being in an environment of such work ethic can increase the level at which you work. I completely agree that this working environment does rub off on me sometimes and increases the efficiency of my work engine.
Whatever your working environment is, finding it and sticking to it every time you study is such a great thing. It helps your ability to concentrate and think, therefore allowing you to just get your work done. Concentration levels are key for revising, as you guys know, so instead of distracting yourself or getting distracted by others, find out what you react to the best when it comes to discovering your environment.
Remember, everyone’s different: What music? Do you even want to listen to music? Do you prefer the library, or being at home? What will make your mind focus in on getting that revision done or writing that essay?

Ah, what’s better than warm weather? Actually, let me rephrase that. Anything is better than this past winter.
Spring is my favorite season, and for many reasons. Aside from the beautiful weather, which is much needed now, spring is a season where seemingly everything begins to come back to life. Trees start regaining a seasonal green, animals awake from their seasonal slumber, flowers begin to sprout up, and children are once again outside playing the sport of their choice.
It’s a beautiful season indeed, but unfortunately, like everything in life, spring has its trade offs. Is it sunscreen? No. Rain? Not really, rather rain than snow! It’s the return of the bugs. They come in all shapes and sizes, some bite, some sting. Perhaps the most recognizable bug is our friend, the bee, and the war it rages on the campus.
The bees are always looking for an easy lunch by a garbage can near you. The bees and their friends, the yellow jackets, patrol this rendezvous spot and seemingly attack or at least intimidate anyone who dares to throw out their trash. Believe it or not, this can turn into a dangerous situation. According to healthline.com, three percent of the population is allergic to bees. If stung, these individuals can land in the ER, facing costly bills, and in some cases, a life or death situation.
I kid you not, bees become a real problem on campus during the spring semester and bees constantly find themselves going toe to toe with Public Safety. In an interview with Public Safety, one officer disclosed his so called ‘Battle with the Bees’.
“I believe it was during finals week of the 2014 spring semester,” said Officer Bradley, who has been at Public Safety at Post for six years. “A swarm of bees had overcome a garbage can outside of Pell Science Hall, and of course, I was called in. Mind you, with a fire extinguisher in hand, to ‘neutralize’ the bees. I sprayed once, and this sent the bees into an enraged swarm into a nearby tree. I did not receive another bee call that day, so I guess I did my job!” Bradley said.
Despite the heroic efforts of our Public Safety Department, bees over the years have had violent encounters with Post students. Lisa Greco, a junior Chemistry major, remembered two bees in particular on her way to class.
“It was my second day of classes here at Post. I had class at Humanities and I wanted to make a good first impression with my classmates and professor,” Greco said. “But, of course, two bees outside on my way to class stung me, right after I threw something out in a nearby garbage can and I went to class with what looked like two huge pimples on my arm and neck!”
Maybe the bees just don’t like us, but nonetheless, bees have become a pervasive problem on campus. Hey, even I was attacked last semester, and yes, it was near a garbage can!
Perhaps this problem that can be dealt with by Public Safety or the Post grounds staff that maintains the campus. Until then, try avoiding the garbage can land mines because perhaps at any given moment, one tossed away water bottle can be taken as an act of war by bees, and you can very well ‘bee’ their next victim.

The side door policies for the residence halls on campus have always been a controversial issue for students who dorm. Students are not allowed to enter or exit through them between 7 p.m. – 7 a.m. Many simply don’t understand the rules of not being able to use the side doors at night, and resident assistants find themselves constantly having to make sure their residents understand that these rules are for safety purposes and should be followed.
According to Suffolk Hall RA Kirsten Manno, a sophomore Math major, Brookville Hall already has alarms on each side door that will take a picture of the front and back of the person, and the rest of the residence halls will be getting this new system as well. There will also be an announcement to alert the person that they are exiting through an unauthorized door, and that the authorities are being notified. “A person that breaks the rules will have to pay a $50 fee for the first incident; if it happens again the fee will be more expensive,” Manno said.
“I personally think adding this [measure] is a good idea, because it makes it a little bit safer for all of the residents,” Manno said. “The RA’s will actually know when people are going out through the side doors and they can have more control over the situation.”
As an RA, Manno thinks that less people will use the side doors when they are not allowed to, as not to incur the fine. “It really depends, because some people are not going to care and just keep doing it, where other people are actually not going to want to pay that fee, and hopefully they’ll stop,” he said.
Brookville is the first dorm on campus to have the new alarm system installed, mainly because it was more of a problem in that building than in the rest. “A lot of people complain that the entrance for Brookville is on the opposite side, and they also complain about when it’s cold outside, they have to walk all the way around from the parking lot to the entrance,” said Brookville RA Vicky Eichborn, a junior Forensic Science major. “They feel it’s an inconvenience, whereas they don’t realize the safety measure that it’s putting in.”
Eichborn claims that since the installation of the alarms in Brookville, the use of the side doors has actually decreased drastically.
“There are far fewer people coming in, which was the bigger issue, and even less people going out of them,” Eichborn said. “There are definitely still people who use them regardless, but I think it’s going to improve the overall safety of the buildings in general.”
It is important in case of emergencies to know who is in the building and who isn’t, so people should be signing all of their guests in, instead of having them enter through the side doors.
Post Hall resident Reyna Romero, a sophomore Early Childhood Education major, understands the safety precautions, but doesn’t think that this new alarm system is necessarily the best option to fix the problem. “I feel like it’s a good idea, and it will make life easier for RA’s and desk attendants because part of their job is to make sure nobody uses the side doors after hours,” Romero said. “But honestly when it’s snowing and the weather is bad, I feel like people should be allowed to leave [through] the side doors.”
Although it may sound like students are just lazy or don’t understand the policies, Romero claims that she understands why this was done, but she thinks there are better ways to go about solving the issue. “They should just make all the side doors [swipe-able]; the same swipe you have to
use to get in[to] the front door should be on all side doors,” said Romero. “This way, if you don’t live in the building, you can’t get in, and it would be just as safe.”
This might sound like the perfect solution, but it might not be the practical one, since students would still be able to let people in without signing them in, which is one of the main safety issues. But it is an
interesting idea, and may be a little less drastic than having an alarm and a camera that takes pictures of you. I think that having to swipe your card to get into the side doors could be like meeting students half way, but I am not sure if the students are willing to take their part in the situation of letting in guests without signing them in.

There are ways to enjoy what is on campus as well as off campus. LIU Post offers two off-campus shuttles that give all Post students the opportunity to visit locations in close proximity to the school provided they present a student ID-card. The shuttles run seven days a week to local destinations such as: Pathmark, Moe’s, NEFCU, TJ Maxx, Hicksville Train Station, and Broadway Mall. In order to use transportation services, Post students can go to the Interfaith Center (“The Chapel”) or the N-20 bus stop, which is located near the B. Davis Schawartz Memorial Library.
The Hicksville shuttle starts at 7 a.m and ends at 9:10 p.m. Monday through Friday, seating 25 passengers. Throughout the week there is also a shuttle that travels to Pathmark, starting at 12:20 p.m. and ending at 5 p.m, holding fourteen passengers. The off-campus shuttles drive to locations that are highly demanded by LIU Post students and should be taken advantage of by all.
Lately, many students have had complaints about the shuttles not being consistent with traveling. “The shuttle is convenient when it is on time, but it is inconvenient when it stops in the middle of the day,” said Donique Berry, a sophomore Forensic Science major. “There have been many times I’ve had to take the regular bus that runs hourly,” she said.
“The times of the shuttle bus do not line up with class times, which is inconvenient for students who do not have a car and commute,” said Ervin Gonzales, a freshmen Musical Theater major.
I think that extending the times will not only give students the time to go to the city, but it will be a good help for students who travel back and fourth from home on the weekends. Also extending the times during the week will make more sense so students can go home right after class instead of having to wait on campus after their classes have ended.
Taking a look at the off-campus shuttle schedule to make revisions will be beneficial to commuters who may live in one of the five boroughs as well as non-commuters. Whether it is during the week or the weekend, having a little extra time to get back to campus free of charge is less burdening to college students than paying for public transportation. Also, the off-campus shuttle transportation is safer than public transportation because LIU Post ensures their students are safe, which gives students a peace of mind. Currently, the off-campus shuttle is not good enough because of its schedule. If the off-campus shuttle times are extended I believe that the shuttle bus will become more successful and more students will use the service.
The off-campus shuttle schedule is available at the concierge desk at Hillwood Commons and in every dormitory housing facility.

“What Red Lipstick Sounds Like: A Cabaret” was performed on March 26 and 27 in the Hillwood Recital Hall by eight female Musical Theatre majors, and was directed by Kerry Prep, an adjunct professor at LIU Post. The idea for the show came from Prep’s daughter, Molly, a student at NYU, who also came up with the title for the show. The cabaret celebrated women, and the message of the songs was about embracing yourself in every aspect of your life.
Prep said, “What does red lipstick say to you? To some, it’s vampish; to others, it’s powerful. And to others, it’s aspirational. Red lipstick conjures up all kinds of feelings in both men and women. It’s a red flag that says, ‘I’m in charge.’ It’s graceful, confident, and charismatic. It defines one as ‘that kind of woman.’ And that kind of woman has a story to tell. You better listen, because she won’t take ‘no’ for an answer. By dressing their lips in red, eight talented young ladies from the LIU Post Musical Theatre program draw your attention to their mouths and the words that came [from] them.”
Numbers for the program were chosen by the actresses, the director, and the stage management team. Students who participated in the show included Assistant Director Jenny Rubin, Stage Manager Ashling Costello, and Assistant Stage Manager Cameron Clay. The actresses were: Emma Barishman, Emily Locklear, Emily Whipple, Diamond White, Anna Betteridge (who choreographed the group numbers), Taylor Bass, Laura Kaye Chamberlain, and Audrey Ney.
To prepare for the show, the performers held rehearsals and had a few meeting outside of rehearsal time to decide on songs. The show included four large group numbers, two small group numbers, and eight solos.
On Tuesday, March 24, the performers did a flash mob in Hillwood Commons to one of the group numbers, “Candy Store” from the musical “Heathers.” The flash mob was done to make the student body aware of the performance that was to take place that week, and to give Post students a preview of the show.
The cabaret was performed without microphones in order to enhance the vocal training taught in the Musical Theatre department. “It’s important for young actors to learn to project their voice in a large space, such as Hillwood Recital Hall,” said Barishman, a senior Musical Theatre major.
“The experience was a challenge because we had such limited time for such a large undertaking, but this particular group of women faced adversity with positivity and joy,” she continued. “There was never an air of competition in the room because all eight of us supported each other completely and acknowledged that we each had our own individual strengths that we could celebrate instead of hide throughout the rehearsal process. I’ve been lucky enough to work with Kerry, our director, three times over the last three years (previously in Bum Phillips: All American Opera, and Into the Woods). He continues to inspire every student he works with because of his ability to motivate without negativity.”

On April 29, LIU Post will hold the 2015 Spring Fling Concert, featuring Ke$ha. The show will be held in the Tilles Concert Hall, and will start at 8 p.m. Tickets are now on sale for $15 with an LIU ID card at the box office.
Ke$ha is a pop singer and a songwriter. She first broke into the mainstream with her cameo in Flo Rida’s rap song “Right Round” back in 2009. Ke$ha’s debut album “Animal” was a hit, reaching the top of the charts right after its release in Jan. 2010. Ke$ha’s latest album, “Warrior,” was released in 2012. She has sold over 57 million records worldwide. Ke$ha’s recent hits include “Crazy Kids,” featuring Will.i.Am. of The Black Eyed Peas, and a feature on Pitbull’s 2013 pop song, “Timber.”
Ke$ha spent time in a rehab facility last year to treat an eating disorder, and, recently, filed a lawsuit against music producer Dr. Luke for sexual assault. These are likely reasons why the performer has had a lack of material. She has stated on social media, however, that she has been working on new content. The performer, who refers to her fans as “animals,” posted on her Instagram addressing her fans: “I will release new music as soon as I can animals, as soon as I f****** can.”
One can expect a fun atmosphere at a Ke$ha concert, marked by showers of glitter. Since Ke$ha has achieved a lot of popularity with her hit songs “Tik Tok,” “We R Who We R,” and “Die Young,” her concerts contain a great deal of effort, using breathtaking colorful light displays and backup dancers. Her recent concerts have had openers such as Semi-Precious Weapons and Mike Posner.
The 28-year-old, whose real name is Kesha Rose Sebert, writes her own songs. She has been influenced by the music of Queen, Beck, Madonna and old-school punk bands. Ke$ha’s songs feature straightforward lyrics, describing the partying, fun-loving lifestyle, based on her experiences. Her music celebrates youth, and contains dance-pop beats and instrumentation, as well as elements of electro pop. Additionally, many of her songs use sing-song rap styles and auto tune.

On Friday, March 27, the baseball team returned to action when they faced the Lions from Molloy College from Mitchell Field in Uniondale, N.Y. The Pioneers fell behind early, but found a way to pull out the 2-1 victory, thanks to an offensive surge late in the game.
Sophomore pitcher Jake DeCarli tossed seven innings while scattering three hits and striking out a season-high 10 batters. The 10 punch outs were the most in a single game for an LIU starting pitcher since Mike Eckerle fanned 12 hitters last season.
Trailing 1-0 in the eighth inning, graduate outfielder Vinny Iacono started the rally with a one-out double. After a productive out moved Iacono over to third base, red-shirt senior infielder Anthony Brunetti, who had three hits up to that point, drove him in with an infield single.
Following a perfect bottom half of the eighth inning by freshman hurler Vinny Ruggiero, the Pioneers’ bats went back to work. With one out in the ninth inning, senior infielder Rick Alessi tripled to right field and subsequently scored on a wild pitch to put the Pioneers ahead 2-1.
Junior pitcher Dillon Burke set the Lions down in order in the ninth inning to earn his first save of the season. He struck out two out of the three batters he faced and now has an eight-inning scoreless streak.
Due to snowfall the following day, the pair of games between the Pioneers and the Lions was pushed back to Sunday, March 29. In the first game, the Lions managed to double up the Pioneers and win by a score of 4-2.
The Lions kicked off the scoring in the first inning as they plated two runs. The hosts later added to their lead in the third inning when junior infielder Michael Rahn ripped an RBI double to left-center to score another run. In the top of the seventh inning, the Pioneers got two runs courtesy of sophomore catcher Kyle Fagan who sent a single to centerfield. The Lions, however, managed to escape the big inning and were still up 3-2 after the half inning.
Looking for an insurance run, junior infielder Deilyn Guzman singled through the right side to put Molloy up 4-2 late in the contest. Senior pitcher Alex Brosnan earned the win while going the distance on the hill. He stuck out 10 batters while allowing two runs on five hits.
The Pioneers rounded out their weekend of games against Molloy looking for another victory. Graduate pitcher Connor McCarthy tossed seven scoreless innings of two hit balls en route to his second victory of the season.
After some sloppy defense by the Lions in the second inning, the Pioneers were able to push a run across and break the scoreless tie. Later in the inning, junior first baseman David Groeneveld sent a single up the middle and plated sophomore catcher Thomas Asbaty to put the Pioneers up 2-0.
A few innings later, Brunetti continued his hot hitting, and singled through the right side to score Alessi and put the Pioneers up three runs. That was all the Green and Gold offense would need in that game as the Lions struggled with McCarthy. The Lions totaled three hits; one less than the number of errors they committed on the field.
Head Coach Mike Gaffney and his squad return to the diamond on Thursday, April 2, when they host the Spartans from St. Thomas Aquinas College. First pitch from Brookville, N.Y., is set for 3 p.m.

On Wednesday, March 25, the No. 10 ranked women’s lacrosse team won its third straight game, knocking off Saint Anselm on 12 by a score of 11-3 in a non-conference battle at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
Leading 9-3 at the half, the Pioneers came off a 7-2 run where senior midfielder Jenna Pierro scored three goals. In the latter stanza, junior defender Honey Roche and red-shirt sophomore attacker Emily Delaney, who collected a game-high five points, each added a tally to put the Hawks away for good.
LIU Post won 12-of-16 draws, nine of which were won by sophomore midfielder Connor Bird. The Green and Gold also doubled up Saint Anselm in shots and held the edge in ground balls. Defensively, Roche scooped up five ground balls and caused two turnovers in addition to her goal. Senior defender Kali Maxwell also caused two turnovers.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, March 28, and won in an 18-2 rout of East Coast Conference rival Molloy College at the Dean G. Skelos Sports Complex.
The Pioneers kept the Lions off the scoreboard for the entire opening half. Delaney racked up all of her career-high nine points in the first 30 minutes. She finished with three goals and six assists, giving the visitors an 11-0 lead at the intermission. Sophomore midfielder Cara Douglas, Bird, and Roche all pitched in with two goals apiece in the opening session.
Molloy would respond in the early moments of the second half, scoring two straight to cut the deficit to nine, but the Pioneers went on to record seven unanswered tallies to secure the win. The visitors had seven different players find the back of the net during the run. Pierro and junior midfielder Kaitlin Gaghan each had a goal and an assist. Sophomore defender Leslie Allen wrapped up the afternoon’s scoring with her first collegiate goal.
LIU Post more than tripled their opponents in shots and won the draw control battle, 13-9. Bird totaled four pints along with five draws while Douglas and Roche each found the back of the net three times. Pierro had a three-point showing, scoring two goals and dishing out one assist. In the cage, freshman goalie Olivia Kirk made three saves. Her counterpart, Laura Vetter, collected 10 stops for the Lions.
LIU Post returned home where they knocked off the University of Findlay, 16-6, in non-conference play on Sunday, March 29, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
In the first half, the hosts controlled the tempo and took a 10-3 advantage into halftime. Douglas and Roche each scored three goals in the first 30-minute session. Sophomore attacker Erin Stacho recorded two of the three first-half tallies for the Oilers.
The Green and Gold opened up the second half with goals from Douglas and Bird within the first five minutes to take a 12-3 lead. The Oilers played tough, but the Pioneers proved to be too much to handle for the guests as LIU went on to score four of the final six goals of the contest. Sophomore attacker Stefani Vagelatos iced the game with a marker with less than two minutes remaining in regulation. LIU Post held the edge in both shots and ground balls while defensively, the Pioneers converted on 16-of-18 clears and caused 24 turnovers.
Head Coach Meghan McNamara and her Pioneer squad return to the field today when they face-off against East Coast Conference rival, University of Bridgeport, in Bridgeport, Conn. The opening draw is set for 4 p.m.

Thomas Asbaty is a sophomore Communications major from Randolph, N.J. Asbaty serves as catcher for the baseball team and is a huge part of the Pioneers defense, playing behind the plate.
Q: What first sparked your interest into playing baseball?
A: When I was a kid my family loved baseball, so I would go out in the front lawn by my cul-de-sac and hit balls with my dad and I just grabbed an interest for the game. I played a lot of different sports when I was younger. I played football in high school as well as baseball. I found baseball to be my best sport and I
just loved it.
Q: When did you first start playing baseball?
A: I started playing competitively for my town league when I was 8-years-old.
Q: What’s the strongest part of your game?
A: Being a catcher, I pride myself on defensive aspects of the game. I try to control the game and not allow any passed balls or stolen bases. I’m mentally prepared for games and I try to eliminate what the other team does best.
Q: What’s the pivotal key to winning this weekend’s series against Molloy College?
A: It’s very big to take three-out-of-four or sweep them. Coming off a three-out-of-four series win against Mercy College, we don’t want to show that we’re a one-and-done team. We want to make our conference know that LIU Post won’t be a team that’s just a roll over. Every series is huge to our team, especially conference play.
Q: How has the squad bonded together as a team during games and practices?
A: Being a second year player, this is definitely the most bonded team. Last year, we were kind of broken up because we had ten freshmen coming in. This year we clicked very well and all of the pitching staff, coaches, and players have molded as a team.
Q: If you could play any other position besides catcher, what would it be and why?
A: Shortstop would be another position I’d like to play. Playing as a catcher, you’re viewed as the backbone of the team or as a captain because you instruct your teammates on the field. When you’re playing shortstop, you can take charge and you’re teammates hear what you’re saying.
Q: Why did you choose to play catcher?
A: I was a nine-year-old all-star and one of our catchers went down with injury, so I volunteered, threw the gear on and I liked it ever since. Catching makes baseball a more interesting game.
Q: How often do you work with your pitchers during practice?
A: I’m with pitchers every step of the way and I’m always in their ear. I work with all our pitchers and our pitching coach and we are always on the same page. The only time I’m not with the pitchers is when I’m hitting in the batting cage. Other than that, we’re working together every single practice. I’m always helping them change their looks and mechanics.
Q: What is your favorite part about playing baseball?
A: I obviously love winning, but I love the whole atmosphere and being with the team whether it’s out on the field or in the dugout. There’s nothing better than being out on the dirt and the cut-grass.
Q: Do you have a favorite baseball team or athlete?
A: I love Derek Jeter and my dad loves Thurmond Munson. Munson is the reason why I wear number 15. He played as a catcher and prided himself on playing the game right with character. I play hard and go out there trying to win every game. The Yankees are my favorite baseball team and I’ve been watching them for a long time. When I was 6-years-old, my dad would make me recite the Yankees lineup.
Q: Any plans after graduating from Post?
A: I’m a communications major, so I want to do something with baseball and maybe announce or commentate. I’d like to play independent baseball and my dream is to get drafted and make my way up. As long as I’m playing baseball, I’m fine.
