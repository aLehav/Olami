 Professor Susan Zeig, chair of the com-munications department, accompanied seven students to a screening called “Following Their Lead Youth in Action” on April 8. Brave New Films and the Ford Foundation sponsored the screening. It took place at The Ford Founda-tion Center for Social Justice in New York City and brought together four nonprofit organiza-tions that rely on the input of youth organiz-ers. The audience gathered to watch four short films, one on each of the organizations, that gave details about the activism of the young people. 
Brave New Films produces films to educate people on a variety of social justice issues. The partnership with The Ford Foundation allowed for these organizations to reach different parts of the country.
Rise For Youth is a Virginia based organi-zation that fights against juvenile detention, advocating for alternatives to youth incarcera-tion. In 2017, they successfully aided the shut down of Beaumont Juvenile Detention Center in Beaumont, V.A., while delaying the con-struction of a second center late last year. 
Youth Vs Apocalypse is an organization that brings climate-based issues to classrooms in the Bay Area. Its goal is to get the youth of California to stand up and fight for their future, reducing their carbon footprint and tackling the issue of environmental racism.
Formed in 1990, the Native Youth Alliance is an organization that represents the indige-nous people of the Omaha tribe (a Midwestern Native American tribe). Its efforts focus on sav-ing the Omaha-Ponca language (native lan-guage) from extinction and providing homes and land for native youth. “Together we wrote to secure a future for the seventh generation,” co-founder Nathan Phillips said at the event.
Based in Colorado, Padres y Jóvenes Un-dos is an organization that handles immigrant issues, from immigrant students’ rights to reforming their schools and elevating the voices of immigrants. Led by youth of color, the group works to end the school to jail track. “The over-use of harsh school discipline, zero-tolerance policies, the criminalization of youth behavior and the disproportionate impact on students of color are causing severe harm to Colorado students, families, and communities,” according to its website.
Although these nonprofits represent differ-ent social issues, they had one thing in com-mon: the efforts of youth make the them some of the fastest growing organizations in the United States and across the world. 
At the screening and discussion, the audience of 40 heard from adults working at the charities as well as a panel of youth representatives from each nonprofit. The panel consisted of high school student Kidaya Wright from Rise For Youth, Althea Phillips, youth organizers for Native Youth Alliance, Alex Ortega from Padres y Jóvenes Unidos, and 15-year-old Hannah Estrada representing Youth Vs Apocolypse. The four discussed the challenges they face as youth leaders, and expressed what the “old folk” in the room could do to help.
Currently residing in Denver, 21-year-old Ortega uses the impact of his immigration story to help children in the same conditions. He was initially undocumented when he came to the US at 16 as an immigrant, Ortega found himself in ESL (English as a second language) classes. 
Ortega was shocked at the number of his peers who were failing with no assistance from the teachers and the school, while he himself was excelling. This is how he first got involved with youth organizing as he establishing a tutor system to help his failing peers. Now, studying at university, and enjoying being a youth or-ganizer, he also identifies the pressures of the job. “Sometimes I come home and just need to cry,” Ortega said, “I just eat ice cream, cry and go on.”

 To make this fast and easy Easter dorm decor, cut your construction paper into three strips of three different widths, each one slightly wider than the last. Fold the three strips of paper into cylinders and then tape them so they retain the shape. 
Next, stack the three cylinders on top of each other with the largest at the bottom. Use the scraps of construction paper to cut out two rabbit-ear shaped pieces and then tape them to the top cylinder. 
Then, use a different color construction paper to cut out two pieces slightly smaller than the ears you just attached and put them in the middle to be the “inner ear.” 
Finally, draw on a nose using a pink or red marker and then use a black sharpie to make two eyes and a cute bunny mouth. You can also attach two small pieces of construction paper to the bottom cylinder to represent two feet. When the craft is done, you will have a tiny, adorable bunny decoration to put anywhere in your dorm.

 Senior BFA digital art and design students showed their digital art and design portfolios to a crowd of viewers at the S.A.L Gallery. The exhibit showed from April 9 to April 14 and featured the work of six senior BFA digital art and design students: Caitlin Buschinski, Patricia Fredes, Anna Burgess, Yuehui Zhu, Xiaonyu Wang, and Anthony Graffeo. A reception took place on April 10 from 5 p.m.-8 p.m. where the artists showed off their work. 
The gallery featured an abundance of pieces from posters and magazine covers, to candles and TV ads that the students created in digital design. Several of the artists had computers set up to show even more of their work in addition to what was displayed in the gallery.
“I started as visual merchandising major at a different school,” Buschinski said. “I realized fashion wasn’t for me, but I still wanted to design, so I looked into design program here and loved the work I saw.” 
Fredes became interested in digital art and design as a method combining of her passions. “I always liked computers and art and I have a passion for art, so I put those two together and it worked out,” Fredes said.
Buschinski mentioned that her favorite works were her vector portraits. “I feel like I portray emotion well in my illustration and in my use of color. I like taking pop culture people and drawing them,” she said.
Fredes spoke more on her design process and what she most enjoyed creating. “I love creating 3D pieces using Maya [3D art design and animation software]. It’s fun. I really like that,” Fredes said. Fredes also spoke more on the process of creating pieces. “My favorite pieces are the ones created in Maya. I also use photoshop to be able to create all the textures for my pieces,” Fredes said
Since the students did various different types of pieces, some of them had a favorite type of piece to design. “I like designing every-thing,” Buschinski said, “I especially love when I can incorporate illustration into anything I do.”

 Marco Codebo, associate professor of Ital-ian and French in the department of English, philosophy, and foreign languages, is as dedi-cated to his health as he is to his students. Although most professors and students drive to school, Codebo prefers to bike. 
“I bike to work from either Westbury or Manhasset,” he said. “I live in Sunnyside, Queens and I carry my bike on the LIRR, and I bike from the arrival station to campus.” The distance for Codebo is more or less nine miles from either station, although he prefers the road from Westbury, which he says is much better for cycling. This month, Codebo made the trip all the way from Sunnyside to Post. 
He bikes for many reasons. “I have been an active cyclist throughout my whole life; the first time I put a foot in this country in 1988, it was for the bike trip of my life: biking across the continent from Seattle to Maine,” he said. He was younger and more fit back then and was able to make the cycling trip in 44 days. He documented his trip in an article titled, “American Dream” on adventurecy-cling.org.
Thirty years have passed and Codebo isn’t as fast as he used to be, but he still enjoys the sensation of riding his bike. “Every time my bike is on the road, I can smell adventure in the air and not only that, on a bike, you feel the season change and you can spot the first flowers in spring and the last rusty leaves in fall; you shiver through the wintery air. In a word, you are more alive than ever on a bike,” Codebo said. 
Codebo has another reason for biking – to protect the environment. “I love my planet and worry about it, the air, water, trees, and grass are common goods. They belong to all of us even if, too often we behave as though they belonged to none of us. I want to take care of the goods I share with my fellow human beings,” Codebo said.
Codebo says cycling to work is just like recycling. “Small actions that become important when repeated many times and shared within a community,” he said. 
Codebo believes the university should lobby local governments for bike lanes on Long Island. He said bike lanes would essentially be fun for a lot of people on the weekends and can make life better for bike commuters like him on working days.
Codebo offers this advice to students: “Take some time for yourself, just for yourself, each day. Time for checking your plans, seeing what good or bad you have done, reminding you of the important things in your life. You do not need hours to do this, just a few minutes, but just do it every day. Turn off the noise in the world, screen yourself from all the distractions, and focus on what you want to do with your life. I need a bicycle to do it, but I bet our students are smarter than me and can think without pedaling.”

 Nassau County legislator Joshua Lafazan, who was the youngest official elected in Nassau County at age 23, will be teaching an undergraduate course in fall 2019 called ENT 60: Running for Office in the 21st Century. It is dedicated to the skills needed to overcome the challenges of running for office as a young candidate. Lafazan is currently 25. 
ENT 60 is a seminar course, which is occasionally offered in the college of management, focusing on special topics in entrepreneurship and allowing students to take advantage of adjunct and visiting faculty who have specialized knowledge in a particular field. The specific title and subject matter change each time the course is offered. Students may take the class as a free elective regardless of their chosen major, according to Dr. Robert Valli, professor of technology management and dean of the college of management.
Lafazan’s course will offer the next generation of politicians insight to how he accomplished defeating seasoned opponents. 
He wants students to understand the similarities between campaigning and entrepreneurship so they can leave the course with the ability to manage and guide their own campaign team. The course is meant to enhance students’ public speaking skills, offer tips on raising funds to run a powerful organization, and instruct them on how to harness technology to make their voices heard.
Throughout the course, Lafazan will address issues facing millennials including climate change, student loan debt and affordable housing. “There are major threats facing young people, where it’s time that we’re going to have to step up and demand that our priorities are met. The surest way to do that is to elect representatives from our own generation,” he said. 
Prior to graduating from the Harvard School of Education with a master’s degree in education policy and management, Lafazan studied at Nassau Community College and Cornell University ILR School, where he received his bachelor’s degree. None of the schools he attended offered a class that specifically taught young people how to run for office. His generation and younger are the largest in number, most educated and diverse in the history of the United States, but they’re the most underrepresented demographic in the legislative assembly, according to Lafazan. He’s excited to teach the course that wasn’t offered to him during his college years, and he thanks Steve Israel, former member of Congress and former director of the LIU Global Institute, for helping him connect with LIU to make it happen.
The local legislator’s political career began in 2001, when he was elected to his student council at Walt Whitman Elementary School in Woodbury. From that moment on, he had a passion for representative government. “I loved the concept that I could use my voice to lift up the voices of others,” he said. “Whether through student government or forensic speech and debate, I always loved politics and government.” 
During his time serving as senior class president at Syosset High School, he found himself and his peers in disagreement with how the school district’s superintendent was running the district. In an effort to get involved and make a change, he decided to run for a seat on the Syosset Board of Education, and in May of 2012, at the age of 18 and one month before he graduated, he became the youngest elected official to any position in N.Y. state. 
After Lafazan was re-elected to the school board in 2015, he became frustrated with the number of young people who reached out to him because they had run for office too but lost, and were now inspired by his success story. He wrote a book in response called, “Political Gladiators: How Millennials Can Navigate the 21st Century Political Minefield and WIN!” This how-to tells the story of 30 young elected officials as well as his own and explains how to run for office. “When you treat young people like they have unlimited potential, they will show you that they can do exceptional work, and in this case, they can swing an election,” he said. “Fast forward to 2017, we had a county executive and town supervisor under federal indictment, and I decided I was going to seek elected office to the Nassau County Legislature,” Lafazan said. 
Lafazan was in awe that his community took a chance on him at such a young age and believes that having met thousands of his constituents before the election was his key to winning. “I don’t forget where I came from, and I don’t forget who I work for,” he said. “I always believed face to face wins the race. So, when I knock on a door and I speak to a resident, I think that they’re comforted in my earnestness in wanting to serve. I view this as public service and not as politics; and when they meet me, I think they’re also comforted to know that I’m accessible.
”Taking a course with Lafazan will give students a view of politics and local government from an insider. “In an era of political disruption, he sits in the center of the aisle; I think the course would appeal to anyone with intellectual curiosity, and an interest in the future of our nation on a personal level,” Valli said. 
The class is scheduled for Wednesday evenings, and a definite time start time has yet to be confirmed. Students who are interested in taking the course should consult with their promise coach or advisor prior to registering.
