Students in various health profession programs receive the full hands-on experience of handling the closest thing to actual patients: mannequins with high-tech simulation capabilities. They can encounter numerous complications and situations that they would encounter in a real hospital. The Interprofessional Simulation Center in Pell Hall houses eight of these mannequins, each capable of a different level and category of health practice. “The eight mannequins each have a specific purpose and they’re each unique in their own way,” Stacy Gropack, dean for the school of health professions and nursing, said.
Students are monitored through one-way glass as they practice tending to their “patients,” by inserting IVs or administering proper dosages of medicine. The mannequins are controlled by technicians or faculty behind the one- way glass. Students are even able to communicate with their “patient” by conversing with the technician talking through the mannequin from the control room. “You can do pretty much any kind of health assessment” on the mannequins, Simulation Center manager Brian Haughney said. “They can cough, they can breathe and do all kinds of things you need them to do.” Just a few of these features include intubation (inserting a tube into the body), cannulation (a technique to place a thin tube inside a vein), and checking blood pressure.
This is not even the extent of the reach of this technology. The center houses a maternity ward housing a mannequin that is actually programed to give birth. The baby, unsurprisingly enough, is a fully functional mannequin as well. With everything being automated, “We can simulate a lot of different complications, too,”
Haughney mentioned. The patient is programmable for mostly any procedure ranging from breach birth to cesarean section, and the baby not only moves and cries but has the capability to turn blue around his lips, fitting specific scenarios. Students are able to interact with the patient in every way they would with a real one.
The center is home to the “most advanced mannequin on the market now,” according to Haughney, and it is nicknamed “Sim-Man.” This machine possesses capabilities as detailed as pupillary dilation. It can breathe and bleed, just like a real person. The technology inside nician in the control room to know what medicine and dosage has been administered, as well as for “Sim-Man” itself to exhibit an adverse reaction that students will have to handle realistically.
“The Interprofessional Simulation Center has been open and in use for about the last sixth months,” Gropack said. After a lengthy development process of approximately two years, the center accurately replicates a realistic hospital. One year was spent solely to redevelop and repurpose the space that the center now occupies. Previously, it was the old nursing skills lab.
Use of the center is not limited exclusively to nursing students. “Students from all of our programs: nutrition, social work, healthcare public administration, nursing, healthcare information management, health sciences, medical imaging all use this center to learn how to work as an interprofessional team,” Gropack said. Case studies are formulated using the mannequins, and students are challenged to put their skills to the test working with one another. Gropack stressed how essential this skill is to being successful in the workforce for healthcare professionals. “Having this simulation center allows our students to be one step above.” The skills and learning opportunities students encounter in the center are all within a safe environment, enabling them to take what they’ve learned out into the real world. The experience with the mannequins should make real cases easier to handle.

Brookville Hall and some of the academic buildings as well, have been getting a lot of heat lately regarding the cleanliness of bathrooms. Students are complaining that the bathrooms aren’t kept up and taken care of on a regular basis.
Junior criminal justice major and Brookville Hall resident Joe Lacy said, “They do clean the bathrooms weekly, but I don’t believe they use bleach, because it smells in there all the time and there are bugs and mold in the showers.”
Lacy added that when students are showering there are little flies flying around. The flies are attracted to the water puddles on the ground.
Keeping public bathrooms clean is difficult in college residence halls, but when you have one bathroom for 30-plus guys on the second floor of Brookville, it is probably much harder.
Senior broadcasting major and Brookville Hall resident Kylie Garret said, “Sometimes I can’t even shower in there, it is so gross. The sinks and toilets are just cleaned with hot water and nothing else; there is hair everywhere.”
Hair is one of the top complaints from the women who live on campus. They have also complained that the sinks and toilets are just cleaned with water and not soap, along with an ongoing fly problem.
“I have been at Post for three years now and I have had the same shower curtains, which is disgusting,” Lacy said.
Garret is not pleased with how the bathroom situation is being handled on campus. “When I wake up at ‘8ish,’ the bathrooms are fine, but by the time I get to the dorm around 5 p.m., the bathroom is a mess and just gross,” Garret said.
Garret feels that the dorm bathrooms should be cleaned at least twice a day or checked in the afternoon. “We pay a lot of money to go to this school and we don’t deserve to have mold and flies in our showers and dirty sinks,” Lacy said.
The R.A.’s of Brookville Hall refused to answer questions about the bathroom situation.
In addition to the dormitory bathrooms, students arrived on campus for classes on Monday, March 6, to find the women’s restroom in Humanities Hall uncleaned, over flowing with garbage and without toilet paper. After professors called the facilities department, the bathroom was cleaned by the afternoon.
According to Bill Kirker, Director of Facilities Services, all residence hall bathrooms are cleaned daily. “My office works to coordinate with RAs, Campus Life coordinators, and A&A – the company that supplies cleaning staff – to ensure that reported issues are addressed as quickly as possible and we always encourage students to let us know if something needs immediate attention.”

The third annual “Battle For More Birthdays,” a student talent show, will take place in the Hillwood Cinema on Friday, March 24 at 6 p.m. The event will be filled with hopefully 10 to 15 diverse acts that will compete to win.
Each contestant will be given a donation bag for friends and audience members to donate money towards cancer. Two winners being announced, with the first chosen based on the highest cumulative points from the judging panel and the second selected from the highest total in their donation bag. The event will close “Relay Week,” and all proceeds will be donated to the American Cancer Society.
Post alumnus and former vice president of both the SNAPPS and Amnesty International clubs, Matthew Miller will make his third performance at the Battle for More Birthdays talent show. The seasoned singer/songwriter, who will sing while playing the guitar, has been involved in music since he was seven years old and “gigging” with various bands and projects since age 15. “I love performing for an audience,” Miller said. “Raising money for cancer is one of the causes that I have been fighting for. Several people in my life have had cancer, so the cause kind of hits close to home.”
Senior psychology major Richard Grillo, who has competed in the event for the past two years, will be this year’s host. His stand up comedy act was awarded third place in 2015 and second in 2015. “I have hosted comedy shows for “Relay” and SAB (Student Advisory Board) events before as well as the talent show fundraiser for Ian [Matuszak] last year,” Grillo said. “I host at comedy clubs regularly so I am very comfortable as a host.” His standup awarded him third place out of nearly 120 people in the Long Island Laugh Out last August. He will also be performing at Studio Theatre in Lindenhurst May 19.
A strong coordinating staff is as essential to a successful show as a strong host. Adam Hornbuckle, SGA vice president and the Relay for Life committee chair, feels that it is important to have dedicated people to work together to plan the event for the most successful results in audience turnout and money raised. “Two years ago, the event was hosted by CSA [Commuter Student Association] and raised about $2,000,” Hornbuckle said. Last year’s event did not raise as much as the year before, totalling about $1,000, which is why preparation for this year is crucial. “Planning is tough. We started planning for Relay Week in the fall but it really picked up in January.” The goal is to reach at least $2,000, but most importantly promote the cause.
Relay Week kicked off Monday, March 20, with students painting their hands on a canvas for the “Hands for Hope” program. On Tuesday, March 21, students taped Campus Life director Michael Berthel to a wall for “Stick it to Cancer,” paying $1 per piece of tape. Pizza will be sold, $1 per slice, in Hillwood Commons during common hour on Wednesday, followed by a kick off party during the day on Thursday where students are encouraged to wear purple for “Post Goes Purple” in honor of the Relay for Life Colors. The week will be capped off by “Battle For More Birthdays,” with raffle prizes, finger food, a light dinner, and entertainment. “We want students to come out and enjoy watching their friends in the talent show while raising some money in the process,” Hornbuckle said. “The emphasis is not on the competition, but on having a good time to finish off an event filled week.” As of March 9, five performances are signed up but there are no restrictions on who can perform in the talent show. Students, alumni, and friends are all welcome. To sign up, contact adam.hornbuckle@my.liu.edu by Wednesday, March 22.

Finding time to go to the gym in college is a struggle, but getting there to find broken machines is an even bigger struggle. At the Pratt Recreation Center, two treadmills and two elipticals were broken. The first treadmill broke months ago and it has been a chain reaction since. Because there are only 24 machines, seven of those being treadmills and the other 17 of being ellipticals, having four broken machines makes exercising difficult for students.
According to Martin Guillet, the associate director of Pratt, “there have been some more significant issues with these machines.” Guillet is normally able to fix these machines on his own, but the machines currently require more electrical and mechanical work.
The machines also require new parts to be ordered. “We needed to order parts and the parts have taken weeks to come in,” Guillet said. When the repair service came in to fix the machines on March 2, the parts that were ordered were incorrect. The repair service “will be in tomorrow [March 2] to repair most of the machines,” Guillet said. As of March 7, when the machines were supposed to be repaired, out of order signs were still placed on the machines.
The broken machines at Pratt have upset several students on campus. Students consistently feel like they are in competition to get on a machine, so with fewer machines, the competition is greater. “The gym is very limited and students who are going to use it for their own personal reasons have to compete with the athletes who have to warm up while they wait for their coaches,” Kaitlyn Veygel, a senior broadcasting major, said. “I feel like I’m entering the Hunger Games every time I go to the gym; when equipment is broken it is even a bigger struggle because there is an even higher competition to get on the equipment that is working,” she added.
Other students don’t have a lot of time to work out, so they feel that it is a hassle if a machine that they need is taken because they either wait or have to change their workout plan. “I wish the ellipticals and especially the treadmills would be repaired sooner [rather] than later. I don’t have a lot of time to work out and the only convenient time is during common hour, so now it’s first come, first serve,” Myles Goldman, a junior forensic science major, said.
As of March 21, one of the treadmills and the two ellipticals were fixed, but an additional elliptical is broken.

As the controversy over transgender bathroom rights continues across the nation, LIU Post has taken action towards gender equality by labeling the first gender-neutral bathrooms in Hillwood Commons.
Located in the hall behind the Campus Concierge, the two single-stall male/female bathrooms on the first floor of Hillwood Commons were converted to gender-neutral bathrooms before the start of the 2016-2017 academic year. “The facilities were converted because as single-stall restrooms, they did not need to be gender specific,” Joseph Vernace, Associate Director of Campus Life, said.
These restrooms do not receive much attention from high traffic areas of Hillwood, such as the Fishbowl, LIU Promise offices, and the student run businesses. They are located between several meetings spaces for campus clubs and organizations, as well as the Campus Concierge.
There are several single-stall restrooms located throughout campus in the residence halls and academic spaces not yet labeled as gender-neutral. Other building such as the Little Theater, the Film, Dance & The- ater building, the Tilles Center, Humanities, and the Pratt Recreation Center are without single stall, gender-neutral facilities for students.
“Identifying these facilities [in Hillwood] and re-labeling them was an easy decision and a progressive step towards a more gender-inclusive campus,” Vernace said.

One of the many challenges college students face is maintaining a stable balance between classwork and a part-time job. Where do we find the time to focus on assignments, readings, research and punching the time clock? Though a perplexing situation, there is a simple solution: time management.
This spring semester, I have a full schedule of 15 credits; as a journalism major, about 99 percent of my assignments involve writing lengthy essays, articles, and research papers – I write every single day. This portion of my academic career takes up most of my time on the weekdays. Aside from academics, I work part-time in retail at Old Navy in the Hicksville Broadway Mall.
I work at least 12 to 20 hours a week at Old Navy, usually hour-long shifts on the weekends that take up most of my day leaving me with enough personal time to eat breakfast and dinner. I spend approximately 15 hours in classes and meetings during the week, leaving me to dedicate free time to work on homework assignments, reach out and interview sources for the newspaper, write articles and eat.
I am able to allocate the time to work by being aware of my availability and estimate how many hours, on average, I need to complete my work as efficiently as possible. This helps to outline a flexible schedule that works with Old Navy and my academics.
Here are some tips to balance school and a part time job:
Keep a planner. Whether it is a physical agenda, or an electronic calendar, notepad, or reminder – I use all four – cataloging the various activities of your day is a great way to find the rhythm in your schedule.
Communicate with the authoritative figures in each setting. More often than not, your employers will be understanding of the importance of your education. My manager, Caitlin, schedules me for the weekends, leaving my weekdays – and nights – free to complete homework assignments.
Having a firm grasp of the structural balance between school and work is all good and well, but you can’t ignore the health aspects that contribute to any type of stress-related activity. Most importantly, you need to sleep. Each night, determine the exact time when you “call it quits” and clock out, and stick to that schedule. You can only perform well when your body is well-rested and recharged for the day. On some occasions, I get called into work on a day that I also have class. If I slept well the night before, it would make for a smooth transition from school, to work and then back home.
There are multiple factors involved in balancing school and work, but it is possible.
Having a part-time job is beneficial to a college student for the obvious reason – money. My paycheck covers school materials and supplies such as textbooks, binders, and pens; eating out or ordering Chinese or pizza; and going out with friends or shopping for clothes. It also helps cover the expenses it takes for me to go home to Pennsylvania at least once a month to visit my family and friends. Having money to spend makes for a more enjoyable college experience. A part-time job also teaches you how to juggle multiple responsibilities. I work at the register, recover the floor, do customer service and restock merchandize. At school I write for the Pioneer weekly, attend classes and meetings, conduct various interviews, participate in school activities and still somehow find time to clean my room.
The great part about learning how to juggle responsibilities with a part-time job is the preparation it grants you for the next step after college: facing the “real world” and all the heavy responsibilities that come with it. Responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook, paying rent, water and electricity bills, car payments, and balancing a professional and personal life. By having a part- time job and successfully balancing it with school, all of the hard work will pay off in the end.

Assistant professor of biology Daniel Hanley is conducting research on how different types of birds, including blackbirds and American robins, detect a parasitic egg in their nest. This is Hanley’s second semester teaching at Post after being awarded a postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of Guelph in Ontario in 2011 and at Palacky University in the Czech Republic in 2013. Hanley earned his undergraduate degree at Cornell University, his masters at Bucknell University and his PhD at the University of Windsor in Ontario in 2011.
Hanley is teaching two classes this semester; General Biology II and Ecology. His two laboratories on campus are located in room 350 in Pell Hall and the greenhouse. While there is no specific course taught in the greenhouse, the space is used for workshops and experiments for his classes. Several students are working with Hanley on their own research projects, including Hunter College graduate Miri Dainson and honors college students Indira Rojas and Ramanpreet Singh, who are both junior biology majors. Hanley is also mentoring Palacky University student Karel Gern. All of the students are earning credit for their work and are working on separate projects that are similar to Hanley’s research. Rojas is researching how the color of birds’ eggs has evolved over time and Singh is researching the evolution of color in plants.
Hanley has been studying the colors of bird eggs since 2004 and brood parasites since 2011. His current research on brood parasites began after his postdoctoral work. “After earning a PhD, you get a position that is kind of like a faculty position where you’ll teach and do research,” Hanley said. “A ‘postdoc’ gives you a little bit more freedom than the typical academic position, so you can teach some classes when you like or do research 100 percent of the time. You have a lot more freedom to do whatever you need to do for your professional development.”
Originally from Lagrangeville, New York, Hanley wanted to work with animals from a young age, first as a veterinarian. He worked at a fish and wildlife center as a teenager, and this job opened other doors for Hanley as he proceeded to work at a bird-banding center in Millbrook, New York. Bird banding is the process of attaching a metal or plastic tag to the leg of a bird in order to identify it and track its movements. Hanley worked at the center as a volunteer through high school and graduation before becoming a primate caretaker at the Trevor Zoo in Millbrook.
Concerning his experience there, Hanley said, “primates are very unpredictable. While at the zoo, I took care of brown capuchins, and the small ones would always try to put monkey chow in your pocket as you walked by. They would also try to grab our keys when we were cleaning the cage because they saw it as an object of value. So to make them happy, we bought Fisher-Price keys and let them play with it while we were cleaning.”
The goal of Hanley’s research is to gain “a better understanding of the recognition mechanisms in birds” in how they detect their eggs. He chose to conduct this particular research because this question hadn’t been addressed before, and it can change “how we understand how birds’ view perception.” While Hanley is not writing a book on his research, he plans to publish a peer-reviewed paper. Hanley wants readers to understand “how important it is to consider the sensory perception and cognitive process of birds and consider what is happening in their eyes and brain when they detect their eggs.”

Oliver, pet of alumna Debbie De Louise, is a 17-year-old Siamese cat. Oliver first belonged to De Louise’s mother until she entered senior care nearly four years ago. De Louise took Oliver in hoping that he and her other cat, Stripey, would get along. “It took some time to introduce them, but they get along well now,” De Louise said. Oliver loves being brushed by De Louise, so she tries to brush him daily, either in the morning or at night. The two also love sleeping together. “He also sleeps with me, sometimes on my pillow,” she said. De Louise graduated in 1989 with a B.A. in English and an MLS in library and information science. As a student, she was a member of the Pioneer newspaper staff.

The man that is Frank Ocean (born Christopher Breaux) came out of hiding once more and graced the Internet with another single, called ‘Chanel”. The singer songwriter from New Orleans, Louisiana originally rose to fame with the punk-rap gritty group known as Odd Future. The group has since disbanded, but several members, including Frank Ocean, are doing just fine in their solo-careers thus far. Frank Ocean took a lengthy hiatus from the music industry after the release of his critically acclaimed album ‘Channel Orange’ on Jul. 10, 2012. Both fans and critics were fond of the album, though Frank’s career began to slow down in the months after the album’s release. It would take four whole years for Frank Ocean to release his sophomore album, titled “Blonde”. The release of Blonde had plenty of fans hyped for new music and were anticipating his return for quite some time. In a somewhat unexpected move, Frank Ocean released a surprise single on Mar. 10, 2017 and Mr. Ocean surely doesn’t disappoint anyone here.
The first line of this song tells you a lot about Frank Ocean. “My guy pretty like a girl / and he got five stories to tell,” he sings over a melancholy but relaxing instrumental. Shortly after the release of his debut album, Ocean took to his blog to write a lengthy post about his sexuality among other topics. Basically, he came out as bisexual and I like how he’s addressing this in the opening line, just to “put it all out there” in a sense and get on with the song. Aside from his sexual orientation, Frank Ocean speaks on the subject of police encounters, being a black man himself. “Police think I’m of the underworld…12 treat a [explitive] like he twelve/ how you lookin’ up to me but talking down,” he said. (The term “12” is a slang term for police). Overall, the song has a chill vibe to it, despite him tackling many subjects that trouble him in his life. Fans get to hear Frank hit all the high notes in the latter part of the song, signing in his falsetto range like he does all too well. “I see both sides like Chanel / C on both sides like Chanel,” he raps, referring to his perspective on things as well as a braggadocios line about being able to afford designer handbags with a C on BOTH sides. “I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards,” is an interesting way to brag about one’s wealth, but somehow Frank does it well here. Perhaps expensive designer bags are just as important to Frank Ocean as saving money on flights is.
This single was a welcome addition into Frank’s discography. Let’s hope he doesn’t take two years to release another one. Please, Frank. end with an open discussion. At this time, a question that a member wrote is picked out of a jar, and the members discuss and give their own input.

Four students took center stage on Thursday, Mar. 9 in the Great Hall of the Winnick Mansion for a flute performance. The venue was a perfect spot for this type of performance. The old feel of the mansion makes whatever is happening inside the walls feel prestigious and noteworthy. Before the performance, the small, intimate, low-lit room filled with approximately 30 to 40 people, waiting to hear the end result of something that students had been practicing for weeks in advance. Accompanied by professor Christine Dore were flutists Celine Hong, Carolyn Lau, Alyssa Rust, and Linck Rossano.
From the first piece, it was evident that a flute concert is unlike most concerts familiar to students. The flute has its own distinct sound, and the audience must be very quiet to pick out each individual note while still listening to the pianist in the background. Dedicated practices are required for pieces like these, as each performance could last up to several minutes. Whenever the audience believed the song was completed, the performer would begin playing once more. Breath control and endurance are especially crucial when playing this type of instrument. It is obvious when a performer is running out of breath as the notes lack the usual “oomph” that they would otherwise have on a full breath of air. Several times throughout the performances I lost track of time but that wasn’t a bad thing at all.
The performers kept the audience intrigued with the constant changing of notes and octaves, and provided that familiar “fluttery” sound that flutes tend to produce.
Some of these performers were practicing for NYSSMA (New York State School Music Association) competitions. A NYSSMA competition brings the finest performers of all instruments from New York, together for a music competition that is to be critiqued by judges. Scoring well in NYSSMA competitions is very difficult, so doing well is an achievement.
Kevin Dolan, a flute concert newcomer and freshman business major enjoyed the concert thoroughly and was particularly impressed with the level at which the performers played, considering their age. “A lot of these performers seemed to be very young, but they were very talented,” he said. “The best part was at the end when the whole ensemble came together [to perform at once],” he said.
Susan Deaver, an adjunct music professor who teaches flute, music history, in addition to coaching chamber music, gave some insight as to how a performance like this comes together, and the preparation needed. “I sent out parts to everybody ahead of time, and we rehearsed in small groups,” she said. “Tonight we [put it all together].” This concert was a showcase of talent and handwork but also practice for possible auditions for some. “Some are preparing for NYSSMA…some [of the high school students] are preparing for auditions for colleges and universities,” she said.
Deaver had advice for young musicians aspiring to move to the professional level. “Practice a lot, go to a lot of concerts, expose yourself to as much music as you can,” she said. The most important tip of all is to find a good teacher.
With the right amount of hardwork and guidance, achieving even the loftiest of goals seems possible.
Members of the complete flute ensemble: Maris Albinder, Jessica Barenzano, Leah Cherenfant, Samantha Clarke, Celine Hong, Sarah Kadtke, Carolyn Lau, KaraAnn Leone, Alexandra Michaelis, Michael Roberts, Linck Rossano, Alyssa Rust, Sophia Sheinin, LiWen Xu, Jennifer Zhao.

Sophomore catcher Anthony Vaglica is starting his first season for the Pioneer baseball team after transferring from a Division I program at the University of South Carolina Upstate. After starting the season Feb. 18, Vaglica received many accolades for his performance within his first nine games of the season. He was named the East Region Player of the Week by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association and the East Coast Conference Player of the Week on Feb. 27 and 28. He also ended the month leading the East Coast Conference in home runs and doubles.
“I feel like I haven’t accomplished anything yet because it’s so early in the season,” Vaglica said modestly. Vaglica said he is more focused on team goals rather than personal goals, and he hopes that his performance along with that of his teammates will lead the Pioneers to a conference championship.
Vaglica is a Long Island native, growing up in Franklin Square, NY. He attended multiple high schools including Chaminade and New Hyde Park Memorial High School before transferring Christ School; a boarding school in Arden, NC where he was asked to join the baseball team.
Nobody in Vaglica’s family played sports after high school, and nobody in his family even played baseball. Starting at the age of 12, Vaglica spent his summers training and developing his skills at Doyle Baseball in Lakeland, Fla., a program Vaglica describes as “the best of the best.” Doyle Baseball has produced many major league players and is run by three former MLB players.
“I was just basically born with a baseball and a bat in my hand, and I just loved playing,” Vaglica said.
After graduating high school, Vaglica stayed in North Carolina for his freshman year of college, attending USC Upstate, where he batted .235 with one home run and ten RBIs for the Spartans. He decided to transfer to LIU Post after the previous Pioneer assistant coach and recruiting coordinator Lou Bernardi, who is now coaching at Iona, informed Vaglica of an open spot on the Pioneer baseball team.
Vaglica also knew sophomore in fielder Jimmy Mendyck before coming to Post. “Before I met him, I heard about him from one of my coaches in high school,” Mendyck said. “He coached Anthony for a summer, and he told me great things about him and how good of a player he is.” The two ended up playing together this summer before Vaglica started his first semester at Post.
“In the beginning I was really shy,” Vaglica said. “You have to know your role in the beginning, and then as you work your way up and prove yourself, you become somewhat of a leader.”
Mendyck said Vaglica was the missing piece the Pioneers needed in their line-up. “Every time it seems he’s in a spot where we need a hit from him, and he comes through for us,” Mendyck explained. “He’s the clutch hitter we needed.” Mendyck described Vaglica as a positive vocal leader who is able to motivate his teammates.
After graduating from LIU Post, Vaglica has his sights set on playing professionally. “I’m a big Boston Red Sox fan, but I would want to play for the New York Mets,” Vaglica said, adding that it would be cool be the “hometown guy.”
The Pioneers are now 8-7 on the season and will return to action March 24 when they take on Saint Thomas Aquinas College at the LIU Post Baseball Field at 3:30.

The unranked men’s lacrosse team defeated also-unranked Georgian Court University from Lakewood, New Jersey, 10-5, in a non-conference game at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium on Saturday, March 18. The win pushed the Pioneers’ record to 4-4 on the season.
The Pioneers got a roaring start, going up 6-0 by halftime and extending that to a 9-0 advantage early in the third period. Georgian Court started to fight back by scoring four unanswered points late in the third and early fourth periods, but the home team was able to stave off the comeback by adding another goal in the fourth period and only allowing one more goal after that.
Post’s defense was strong early in the game. Sophomore mid fielder Connor Farrell tacked on five more groundballs to his team-leading total of 43 for the season, while junior attackman Chris Trassaco led the Pioneers with five turnovers in the game. Sophomore goalkeeper Bryan Ochs saved seven shots in his first start of the season.
The Pioneers’ offense was led by sophomore attackman and midfielder Frank Ranfone, who scored three goals to bring his team-leading total up to 19 for the season. Junior mid fielder Dylan Harned and freshman mid fielder Dan Foley also contributed two goals of their own. Foley also led the team with 10 shots. Trassaco and freshman mid fielder Nick Grassa both had two assists in the game.
Overall, the Pioneers won a season-high 17 out of 19 face-offs, picked up 34 ground balls, and red a    season-high 50 shots to Georgian Court’s 29. The Pioneers also converted one out of three extra-man opportunities.
The Pioneers’ next contest is at home on Wednesday, March 22 at 12 p.m. in a conference game against Dominican College. The Pioneers are 1-1 this season against East Coast Conference opponents.

A strong start by the women’s lacrosse team lead them to their second victory of the season against Philadelphia University, March 8, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
The Pioneers got off to a hot start, going 7-0 in the first 14 minutes of the game. The first two goals were scored within the first two minutes by senior attacker Connor Bird with assists from freshman attacker Jill LoManto and freshman mid fielder Alyssa Mallery. Senior attacker Stefanie Vaelatos also scored two goals in the first half along with two assists throughout the rest of the game. Sophomore mid fielder Ryan McKinney and freshman attacker Jill LoManto each scored a goal during the first half to give the Pioneers an 8-3 lead going into halftime.
Although the Pioneers started off strong again during the second half, the Rams were able to keep the home team’s offense from scoring for nearly 20 minutes in the middle of the final half while closing their deficit to four points with just five minutes left to play.
Junior goalkeeper Olivia Kirk was able to make eight saves for the home team, and the Pioneers led the Rams in draws 15-7.
Head coach Meghan McNamara said that they should utilize their speed more offensively. “Unfortunately, our shooting percentage was quite low,” McNamara said after the game. “So I think that had a factor in a little bit of our confidence.” As a result, she said her team will make some tweaks on the defensive end to help better control the tempo.
The Pioneers will return to action March 22 when they travel to Rockville Centre, NY to take on Molloy College at 7 pm.

The women’s golf team finished in fifth-place out of 12 teams in the BrownGolf Invitational in Pinehurst, North Carolina on March 17-18. At the end of the two-round tournament, the Pioneers carded a score of 711 and were led by their captain Hannah Pohalski, a graduate student majoring in health science. Pohalski was tied for twelfth place and shot a +26 over 170.
Speaking about the tournament, Pohalski said, “the team as a whole struggled on the first day due to lack of practice. We stood in seventh of 13 teams at the conclusion of the first day. The second day we bounced back from a rough start and the girls all grinded out decent scores to help us climb 2 spots to 5th place. Overall, it was a successful tournament, we played the best with what we had and the time we had to prepare.”
