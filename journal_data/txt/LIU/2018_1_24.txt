In December 2017, the New York State Department of Education approved Long Island University’s request to institute a veterinary technology program at LIU Post. The program, which is set to begin in the fall of 2018, is one of only 21 accredited, four-year integrated undergraduate degree programs offered nationally in veterinary technology. The program offers a bachelor of science degree, and graduates will be eligible to take the national licensing examination to become licensed veterinary technologists.
A veterinary technologist assists veterinarians in, among other things, surgery and recording patient history and research. A veterinary technologist is different from a veterinary technician, which only requires two years of education in an associate’s degree of applied science, rather than a bachelor of science, according to Robin Sturtz, the newly appointed director of the vet tech program.
Sturtz was chosen by a search committee consisting of animal facilities director, Christopher McAllister and Stacy Gropack, dean of the school of health professions and nursing. Sturtz, a 2004 graduate of the College of Veterinary Medicine of Georgia, has been involved with vet tech education for over 10 years at CUNY and Mercy College, and currently works in clinical practice as an associate veterinarian at the Long Island Cat Hospital in Williston Park. “I love teaching. I love our students because vet tech students tend to be very focused, they like what they’re learning and it makes it a lot of fun for a teacher when you have that,” Sturtz said, explaining her experience at her previous schools.
The program, which will be housed in the school of health professions and nursing, will include education on different types of animals, and hands-on experience both inside and outside the classroom. LIU has partnered with the North Shore Animal League (NSAL) in Port Washington to aid students in their education. At NSAL, students will be able to observe the workings of a large animal shelter and its hospital. NSAL is also offering externship opportunities for students when they reach that part of the program, according to Sturtz.
Students are required to spend over 500 hours working on local farms, zoos, animal hospitals, shelters, and research facilities to get “hands-on” clinical experience, that will later aid them in their clinical internships. Live animals will not be used in the classroom setting. Students will be able to work with live animals during their time off campus.
Sturtz and Gropack hope to fill the entering class for the program with at least 40 students. So far, the program has received around 15 applications, according to Gropack. The program will be open for incoming freshmen and transfer students. Applicants should have a “desire to work with animals and have a strong science background,” Sturtz said.
Space is being renovated in the Life Sciences Hall to accommodate the program. “Our students will be able to study on campus using the latest in imaging equipment, mannequins and models,” Sturtz said.
Much like the patient mannequins in the nursing program at Post, these vet tech mannequins are combined with a software that simulate “check-up” scenarios, and even have a heartbeat. “We want our students to be well-rounded, well educated, and well trained,” Sturtz said.
Veterinary technologists have a broader education than technicians, and can hold management and supervisory jobs. The program will start with introductory classes on basic animal education before leading to more advanced, master classes. Students can also narrow their focus through electives in four areas: research, rehabilitation, business, and behavior. Career options after graduation are very diverse. “Veterinary technologists work in private practice, corporate practice, shelters, research, industry, the military, zoos, and for the federal government,” Sturtz said.
There are 21 veterinary technology programs in the United States, and just 14 accredited programs in the state of N.Y., Sturtz said, and a high demand for vet techs in the country. Employment of veterinary technologists is projected to grow 20 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations, according to Gropack, as veterinarians continue to utilize technologists to support their practices, do general care and lab work.
The program is expected to be “sufficiently funded,” with expenses for equipment and trips being covered, according to Gropack. The budget for the program is still being calculated, yet “the university and President have made a commitment to funding the program,” Gropack said.
Corrections: In the Jan. 24 issue, the Pioneer incorrectly reported that the new veterinary technology program is accredited. The program is not yet accredited, and will be only after an application process with the American Veterinary Medical Association. The program has been registered with New York State, but is not yet nationally accredited. The Pioneer also incorrectly reported that there are 21 four year integrated undergraduate veterinary technology programs in the United States. There are actually 210, including associate programs.

LIU Post, nestled on the North Shore with about 307 acres of land, attracts a variety of wild animals, including geese that land and feed on the campus lawns. Many students are unaware of or not troubled by the geese. “The geese don’t really bother me, I barely see them on campus and when I do I don’t feel threatened, Thomas Palini, a junior political science major and Class of 2019 President, said. Yet, the department of facilities is actively working to eliminate them from campus.
According to the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the geese are relatively harmless. The Pioneer is unaware of any attacks on students or others by the geese. However, the large number of geese on campus tend to leave large quantities of feces all over paths and campus grounds. The HSUS reports that a single goose can defecate every 20 minutes and leave up to 1.5 pounds of feces each day, in addition to an unpleasant sight and smell that can carry harmful bacteria. “Normally, the feces on campus doesn’t bother me,” senior political science major Paul Franco said. “However, one day I was on my way to an interview at a law firm, stepped in the feces, and it was all over my brand-new shoes and the bottom of my suit pants; this is unacceptable,” he added.
Roy Fergus, the director of facilities services, handles this issue along with many others. “The facilities grounds team works to clean/clear pathways and affected areas and as part of our operations; we have engaged and utilize subject matter experts in managing the impact of geese forays on the LIU Post campus,” he said. Fergus did not explain where or how the collected fecal matter was disposed.
Facilities services has retained the Long Island Geese Control to significantly reduce geese sightings on campus. “We have a fully executed contract with Long Island Geese Control, who has expertise in safely and effectively managing the geese problem; I have been advised that this problem will eventually subside,” Fergus said. During the winter break, a Long Island Geese Control car with a dog were seen on the Great Lawn chasing the geese away, according to staff members who were on campus.
Long Island Geese Control, a company located in Smithtown, acts to eliminate the geese. They don’t kill the birds; instead, they use a unique technique where a border collie bred dog chases the geese away for a consecutive amount of visits. The procedure, according to William Alemaghides, the CEO of the company, requires that the dog stays on campus for a few hours a day, several times a week, continuously chasing away the geese until the birds feel like the area is threatened and migrate somewhere else. “The more the geese fear the seeming threat of a potential predator, the less likely they will want to spend time at that location,” Alemaghides said.
To service a university of this size, Alemaghides charges a fee of about $975 per month, with three visits a week. LIU Post has used the services of the Long Island Geese Control sparingly, however, with only two sightings of them at work on campus during the month of January on weekdays. The geese control services have been put into use since the beginning of the fall semester, according to Alemaghides. Yet after each geese-chasing session, the geese were seen, returning, shortly after.
“The dogs do a good job chasing the geese away. But the geese are not stupid,” Barbara Fowles, chairperson of the department of communications and film, said. Fowles’ office faces the Great Lawn, where she has a perfect view of the geese control at work. “A few minutes after the dog leaves, the geese are back. It is not really effective, it is certainly not worth the expense – especially now when people are hardly lolling about on the lawn. The goose poop is disgusting, but they will move on when spring comes, and then the lawn can be cleaned up for the summer. That makes more sense,” she said.
Have you seen less geese and feces on campus this semester? Do the geese bother or delight you? We want to hear from you at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

Associate Professor of History, Willie Hiatt spent his fall 2017 sabbatical working on an oral history project in Peru. He interviewed between 75 and 100 individuals about the blackouts that occurred in Peru during the Shining Path period in 1980-2000, particularly those that took place during 1982-1992.
Hiatt chose the oral history format in order to give a better picture of the personal experiences people had. “Oral history can provide insights into macro-and micro-level engagement with technology that differs substantially from ethnographic observation [scientific descriptions of peoples and cultures with their customs, habits, and mutual differences] and archival sources. To be sure, blackouts were complex technological events, but they also were social crises, police and military challenges, economic and political emergencies, and often life-and-death matters,” Hiatt said.
Interviews enabled individuals to articulate their responses to nationwide attacks on electrical grids as well as the accompanying loss of traffic lights, gas stations, elevators, water pumps, washing machines, televisions, blenders, and many other technologies that modern societies take for granted. “My research remains attentive to the fact that oral history interviews are processes of remembering, and as such, these retrospective accounts must be subjected to critical discourse analysis,” Hiatt said.
Oral history narratives can be rich sources of documentary evidence and, according to Hiatt, can make an important contribution to our understanding of how people engage, understand, adopt, and adapt technology. “Interviews will allow respondents to tell personal stories that raise larger historical questions and illuminate shifting national narratives,” Hiatt said. Hiatt has written a book, “The Rarefied Air of the Modern: Airplanes and Technological Modernity in the Andes,” also based in Peru. This led him to further explore the role of technology in Peru. “I began to consider a project on the history of electricity. Electricity arrived in Peru in the late nineteenth, early twentieth century, and I did quite a bit of archival research on that, and I am still going to explore that and possibly incorporate that into this current project,” Hiatt said.
Oral history provided Hiatt an opportunity to explore territory that he previously did not explore. “Between 1982 and 1992 mostly, blackouts due to the destruction of these electrical towers became a way of life in Lima, and just about everybody regardless of your profession, your socioeconomic level, where you lived in Lima, whether you were in one of the poor marginal areas or in a more affluent area, everyone experienced these blackouts and had a personal account, personal memories of what they did during these power outages. And so I began to think about doing oral history for the first time.” The research he did for his first book was exclusively archival, including newspaper articles, congressional documents, military documents, official reports, and magazine articles. This project consisted of interviews.
Hiatt interviewed engineers and artists, doctors, people in the poorer areas, and teachers who taught night school. The power outages almost always happened between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., which had a big impact on classes that took place at night. He also talked to several people who were in the arts, including at least two novelists about their work and their experiences. “It was an amazing experience to travel all over Lima and to see lots of different people from different socioeconomic levels from different professions to hear their stories,” Hiatt said.
“I was really impressed that Peruvians were willing to open up to an academic from the United States and to tell their stories. Often I would get names of potential informants or interview subjects from friends of friends and I would only have a cell phone number, so I would often call them up and I would have 45 seconds or a minute to introduce myself, to tell them what my project was about and to ask if they would be willing to meet with me to give me their testimony or to share their memories. The great majority of people who I asked to interview accepted. Some of them were just amazing. Even people who didn’t necessarily have a higher education could be very articulate in discussing and thinking about the impact of the blackouts on their lives,” he said.
The intent of the blackouts, according to Professor Hiatt, was to sow chaos and to destroy the bourgeois regime; but while there was fear and anxiety about how to deal with these blackouts, the blackouts had interesting cultural and social effects on Peru. “A whole culture of coping with blackouts emerged, candles became a staple in just about every Peruvian household, some of the wealthier families and many businesses had small electrical generators, and the sound, the roar of those generators was what many of those informants remembered from that period. Peruvians were quite ingenious in their response in some ways; a little informal business emerged where people would use a car battery to supply a television or maybe small appliances with the house,” Hiatt said.
For Hiatt, the stories of the Peruvian Shining Path period have much to teach us about the role of technology in society. “It shows you the role that technology plays in both bringing people together but also kind of isolating people,” he said. “One really interesting description of the blackouts was that it brought family members in their households together because people had to stop watching TV. It forced people to talk and to have family conversations again. That was before even cell phones and iPads and computers, so we’re even more isolated in many ways today. And so in this case, the blackouts brought people together. In another sense, it also brought people together because this was a common experience based on technology that everybody, whether you were in a poorer section or a wealthier section, experienced.”
Although he is back on campus for the spring semester, Hiatt is still working on the project. “I have a conference in Belfast in April where I will be presenting the first findings of this project. I’m not completely finished with all the interviews, so I will return to Peru in June and July to continue,” he said. In addition, Hiatt intends to turn his oral histories into a book.
This semester, Hiatt is teaching HIS 304: World History, 1750-Present (Honors), HIS 190: Globalization and Latin American Film, and HIS 599: Latin American Intellectuals.
Jeanie Attie, chair of the history department, has found Hiatt’s efforts to be of educational value to students. “Professor Hiatt’s research on Peruvian history and his use of a wide variety of sources (including interviews, films, fiction) have provided his students with unique understandings about how ordinary citizens experience historical change and how past events shape the present,” she said. She added that Hiatt “has always been committed to teaching his students how history is done and I am sure they will be intrigued to learn more about oral histories.”
“This is an ongoing project,” Hiatt said. “Although I completed most of the research during my sabbatical, I will continue different aspects of the project for years to come.”

The Student Government Association (SGA), a body of elected students acting on behalf of the student population and led by senior President Giovanna Domingo and junior Vice President Olivia Kavanaugh, have released their plans for the spring semester. Domingo and Kavanaugh are joined on the executive board by Senate Advisor Stefanie Giovine, Treasurer Louis Pisano, Secretary Madeline Nunley and Parliamentarian Adam Silverstein. 
Domingo and Kavanaugh agree on their aims as SGA leaders. “Our goal as a student government is to make sure that we represent and be seen as a voice for the student body,” Kavanaugh said. “We look forward to and are optimistic with what is going to happen on campus this semester,” she added.
So what is going to happen on campus this semester? One of the biggest events for the SGA this spring is the biannual town hall meeting, where students have the opportunity to speak with SGA directly. “We will be hosting a town hall meeting this semester to hear about student’s concerns. As student government we want our goals to be based on the students’ needs. For example, SGA is very focused on advocating for students to receive side door access,” Domingo said.
SGA also plays a huge role in fundraising on campus. Their annual Relay For Life event takes place this semester on April 12 at 4.p.m in the Pratt Recreation Center. “We take on a huge role in fundraising for Relay for Life, through events and raffles,” Kavanaugh said.
This semester, SGA will also be interacting with the athletic department on a more regular basis. “I believe that similar to SGA, the athletic community is a very influential part of our community. SGA is planning on inviting a SAAC representative to every meeting,” Domingo said. The SAAC body is much like the SGA, but focuses on issues for student athletes. By working with SAAC frequently, SGA is able to address concerns raised by student athletes, such as more athlete friendly options in the dining hall. “We are looking forward to providing any student support they may need at games and matches, encouraging other students on campus to have that same mentality and well-rounded school spirit,” Kavanaugh said. Domingo spoke of the plans to collaborate with not only the athletic body, but also clubs and Greek life.
Caitlin Johnstone, junior representative for the swim team, believes that encouraging the athletic community to be more involved in student government can only result in success. “It’s really encouraging that SGA want to pay attention to the issues raised in SAAC meetings,” Johnstone said. “It gives me and the other SAAC representatives a chance to express the wishes of the athletic body to those who can do something about it,” she added.
These events the SGA take part in do not come about without challenges. Domingo believes that the hardest challenge is getting in contact with the students. “I think the biggest challenge SGA faces is having access to students to hear their concerns. All SGA senators conduct office hours once a week, and we hope to encourage students to stop by with any of their needs,” Domingo said. The offices are situated in Hillwood Commons.
SGA did not meet over winter break, and will have its first meeting of the spring semester on January 22. The basic plan for the semester is already set, according to Domingo, and SGA is excited to get the semester underway and to further encourage student involvement. Along with voicing concerns, Kavanaugh and her peers encourage students to take part in SGA.“The best way a student can get involved in SGA is to apply for a position if they feel they want to help in continuing to make a positive impact at this school,” Kavanaugh said.

Being a dean can have its ups and downs. Deans are responsible for running their own offices, as well as all the departments within their school or college. Each of the five academic deans at LIU Post has the responsibility of making sure their schools run smoothly throughout the school year. In the College of Arts, Communications and Design, Steven Breese, who was appointed on July 1, 2017, has already instituted many changes in his first full semester at Post.
“Dean Breese has a rigorous and dedicated work ethic,” Jennifer Miceli, chairperson of the music department, said. “His easy, upbeat communication style makes him approachable even in challenging situations. In particular, I appreciate his sincerity, integrity, follow-through, and great sense of humor,” she said about her first semester working with him.
Breese is familiar with the responsibilities that come with the position of a dean. In the years before he arrived at LIU Post last summer, he served as dean at three institutions, the most recent being the academic dean of arts and sciences at Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU). In the article “Meet New Communications and Liberal Arts Deans” in Sept.13, 2017 issue of The Pioneer, Breese said that in his five years at SCSU, he oversaw 250 full time faculty and 350 adjunct professors. The appointment to the Dean position was a “very long” and “not so easy” process, according to Breese. He was vetted by a search consultant firm in Boston that conducted a national search for the right fit for the campus. There were many applicants for the dean position. Breese did a lot of research and preparation before his interview with the firm. Once the search was narrowed down, a search committee of LIU Post faculty and administrators ultimately chose him out of three other finalists.
Breese replaced Noel Zahler, who was dean from August 2011 to August 2016. Professor Christine Kerr, the director of the art therapy program, acted as CACD’s interim dean during the 2016-2017 academic year until Breese was appointed.
Breese has enjoyed his first semester at Post. “I like the staff and faculty; they have been very supportive,” he said “The staff of the College of Arts, Communications & Design are highly creative artists and researchers, and are ready for a change,” he said.
CACD will undergo a few changes in the near future. Breese will be bringing the world of virtual reality and a new undergraduate communications major to the college, among other things. He is excited to help the departments in the college grow. “Dean Breese helped us to establish a sound recording contract, which allows us to archive and feature on our website LIU Post performing ensemble recordings,” Miceli said. “Together with Dean Breese, the Department of Music anticipates installation of new computer and keyboard labs as well as a state-of-the-art recording studio,” she continued.
“Dean Breese has asked us to develop new programs in digital arts & design, music and communications and film for next fall,” Barbara Fowles, the chairperson of the department of communications and film, said. “We will be launching a new degree program in general communications, which is a major step,” she continued. The faculty within the department submitted a draft to Breese, but Fowles said the degree of faculty involvement from that point forward is very different from past practices. “We are hoping a good program will result and bring in some new students for the department. He is very enthusiastic about various faculty projects and tries to support them,” she said.

Over the years, certain school districts have failed to implement quality support that students need in order to excel in academics and be prepared for college. Until elected officials support programs that aid high school students in enriching their knowledge in various academic fields, many young adults provide tutoring and counseling that help prepare students who plan on moving forward in their academic paths.
Kayla Flores, a 2015 graduate of Hempstead High School, is now a junior at Hofstra University, after transferring from Nassau Community College. Flores, whose family is from El Salvador, is a Sillcox scholarship recipient. She returns to Hempstead High School to contribute to the students as a GEAR (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness) up tutor. Because mathematics is her strongest subject, she is an integrated algebra and algebra core tutor. She has provided assistance to children who are in need of help when they don’t understand material in the classroom. “When I worked for seventh graders, I was just tutoring one particular student. When I worked for 8th graders, I walked around to see who needed assistance. When I worked for 9th graders, I assisted as a teacher assistant,” Flores said.
She says the GEAR up program not only assists students with specific subjects, but also provides students insight into the college environment. “Besides tutoring, GEAR provides trips to colleges to see how it
is to attend college, to understand different degrees, how many years a degree equals to and the expenses of college,” she said.
Flores gives props to teachers in the district who work extra hours for students who don’t understand the class material. She knows the work and stress it can entail to be an educator of many students. She gives up her lunch break during work to tutor students at Hempstead High School.
“Even when I was on lunch break and even if I was too tired to do it, teaching students tends to happen every moment. I’m not going to discard the student; I am someone that the students can rely on and I don’t want to break that trust,” Flores said. She regrets that the GEAR Up program has not received more recognition.
Attending Nassau Community College and transferring to Hofstra has taught Flores how to be a better student and to be proactive with her academics. In addition to tutoring, she gives back to the students in Hempstead by participating in the Sillcox Alumni panel, an event that allows her to share her college experiences with future Sillcox corhorts. “Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there; don’t be afraid of not knowing,” Flores advises high school students who may not be confident in their academic pursuits.
Although a program like GEAR up benefits high school students, it is not only high school students who benefit from peer tutoring.
Diontae Joshua Alleyne, a graduate of Fort Hamilton High School in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, is a senior broadcasting major at LIU Post. Although he has experienced life as a HEOP student, he became a tutor himself to give back to students. Alleyne has duties similar to a teacher and a mentor. As a HEOP tutor, he “had to make sure the students were on time to class, making sure they did their homework, and answer any type of questions that they were confused about,” he said.
During the summer, freshman entering HEOP undergo an intensive five weeks of college preparation work. Alleyne participated in the college preparation program, both as a student and as a tutor. “I enjoyed the five weeks mainly for the students. I shared a personal relationship with each and every one of those guys during the summer, so it was definitely bigger than just the money,” he said.
The HEOP program has helped Alleyne become a better student himself, academically. He said that being involved in the program has shaped his whole perspective on how serious school should be taken. “The one thing I would say that changed me as a person would be my freshman year. I was failing almost every class and on the verge of being academically suspended. William Clyde, who runs the HEOP program, pulls me into his office and talked (wasn’t a good one) but after that conversation with him, I had two options, either continue to go down the bad path I was going to or I could take Mr. Clyde’s advice and finish out my three years strong,” he said.
Alleyne believes more tutoring and support programs should be implemented on campuses. Alleyne credits the program for leading him to this, his last semester of his senior year. “I strongly believe we should have this type of help in our communities. Where I live, there’s so many ethnicities with talent and most can’t go to college because it’s not affordable for them,” he said.
The HEOP program has motivated him to pursue his passion and to earn better grades during his time in college.
Mia Vetri, a 2014 graduate of St. Catharine’s Academy in the Bronx, will graduate from LIU Post in 2019 with her undergraduate and master’s in criminal justice and minor in forensic psychology. She has an Italian and Puerto Rican background. She grew up in the Bronx with her mother, father, and older sister. Vetri received sports awards throughout high school due to her dedication on the girls’ soccer varsity team. In the beginning of high school, Vetri did not have any interest in academics. Becoming college ready and a tutor counselor for HEOP (Higher Education Opportunity Program) students at Long Island University helped strengthen her reading and writing skills. “Everything the students were taught, I was taught too,” she said.
She said the HEOP program gives students a second chance to redeem themselves academically for their future and believes that this kind of peer counseling and tutoring assistance should be offered, not just in college but for high school students as well.
“To me, the HEOP program is a second chance for students who didn’t excel in high school. It’s a program where incoming freshman can get that help they most likely did not receive while in high school,” Vetri said.
As a tutor HEOP counselor, Vetri mentors other students in the program.“I would give extra help to students who needed it, even if it exceeded the initial tutoring hours,” she said.
Vetri enjoyed her experience as a HEOP tutor for its ability to change a student’s academic viewpoint and their choices outside the classroom. She loved how she was capable of building a connection with each student. “I related to the students due to the fact that I wasn’t a very good student in high school. I didn’t want my students to make the same mistakes that I did,” Vetri said.
Maleek King, a 2017 graduate of Hempstead High School, is a freshman at Nassau Community College. He is a US citizen with a Jamaican and African-American background. King has given back to his community by volunteering at the Hempstead Public Library and giving out food to those attending Agepe ministries. King is a Sillcox recipient and has received a mathematics scholarship from Hempstead High School. He has a desire to become a math teacher for New York State public school system. King decided to work as a GEAR (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness) tutor at his college. This program ensures that students will gain an early access to the college process and academic support from adolescence to adulthood.
“Some students are unaware of the process of registering, applying to school, and the amount of years it takes to retrieve a certain college degree,” he said.
With a passion for mathematics, King tutors for students who are in need of help in Algebra One and Two. Aside from providing math assistance, King is also a mentor to these students when he is off the clock. “I don’t see this as a job. Although I want to be a teacher, having the ability to mentor someone one on one and relate to them with similar life experiences is crucial, especially in the Hempstead School District today,” King said.
“When I attended Hempstead High School, I noticed that there was only one teacher that gave class instruction instead of it being a teacher, teacher assistant, and a tutor in a class. Most of the time, I would see only one teacher trying to help a lot of students all at once,” King said.
Tutors, like King, rescue teachers who can’t give undivided attention to just one student, especially when the lesson is hard to understand. If the GEAR up program was developed earlier, King believes that his grades in the beginning of high school would have improved.
“Having the opportunity to work for GEAR up establishes my foundation for teaching and I am certain to become a mathematics educator in New York State. My overall experience of transitioning from high school to college and becoming a mentor to my students was necessary because in our community, having a connection with our students is beneficial and crucial for our success rate to flourish,” King said.
Flores, Alleyne, Vetri, and King are just some of the college students who are giving back to their communities by tutoring and mentoring other students. So, will our children continue to be left behind? As one culturally diverse community, supporting programs like GEAR up and HEOP enable us to put political issues aside and place children’s needs and development first.

A young generation often given grief for being lazy, overindulgent in its love of iPhones and social media, and dedication to pop culture is often also crowned as being motivated risk takers. Entrepreneurs under the age of 30 start businesses faster than the baby boom generation, according to a 2016 BNP Paribas Global Entrepreneur Report. Many young CEOs starting businesses in their 20’s are not afraid to dive into a sea of sharks. Success stories like that of Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, and Bill Gates, former CEO of the Microsoft Corporation, give support to the argument that a college degree may not be required to have a thriving business. However, having a degree does have a lot to do with the success of a startup business.
In the United States, the average college graduate is between 25 to 34 years old. Thirty six percent of those living in metropolitan areas are college graduates compared to 51 percent of rural residents who have no college degrees.
Tracy Walker, 27 year old CEO of Lash Diggs, LLC., who lives in the suburbs of South Jersey, attended college but did not complete all of the courses to graduate. “I was attending school to finish a BA in Science for computer science. Like many other students, I ran out of funding and could not afford to finish my senior year,” Walker said. When Walker decided that beauty was more than a pastime and was her passion, she pursued a cosmetology license. “Prior to secondary education I received my cosmetology license in 2009 and I have been able to use it to create my business,” Walker said.
Walker is a full-time entrepreneur and mother who uses her time to market Lash Diggs, LLC., in a way that is compelling to 25 to 35 year olds. With the help of social media and her company website, www.lashdiggs.com.  Walker serves over 50 lash clients from both lash extensions and strip lashes. “We pride ourselves on a chic, classy aesthetic. Our mission is to give women a level of confidence that will allow our clients to attack their goals head on. When you look and feel better you often do better,” Walker said.
Walker uses social media for her company, but also makes house calls and has loyal clients who visit her home for lash extension services beginning at $125. “I just stay true to myself and to my brand. As a result, my company has prospered,” Walker said. Lash Diggs, LLC., has been in operation since May 6, 2017 and will soon be available for sale on Amazon. “My plan for longevity is to keep going. I write down my goals every morning and night and I check them off if accomplished. If I continue to stay grounded in my faith and remain positive while on this journey I will be successful and resilient against time,” Walker said.
Licensed traveling massage therapist Sharee McFadden started her business, Anointed Touch, at the age of 27. Located in Woodbury, New Jersey, she serves the Delaware Valley with the techniques of hot stone prenatal, therapeutic, swedish, deep tissue, scrub, and reflexology. “As a young girl I always massaged my grandmother and she told me that I was effective in the area of massaging. As I got older I found massaging was my passion and made a career out of it,” McFadden said. McFadden attended a specialized trade school, Harris School of Business, but did not graduate from college. “At school I was taught how to make my career into a business but I am figuring things out as I go,” McFadden said. “I have a 3 year old to take care of and I work retail and am a hairstylist. I was also recently hired at Hand and Stone Massage and Facial Spa,” McFadden said. McFadden administers massages starting at $40, making an estimate of $125 a day. On Facebook and Instagram, she posts flyers with sales information for her committed and potential customers. “My goal is to one day have my own therapeutic spa called, Anointed Touch,” McFadden said. The new CEO has been in business for six months and clientele continuously grows each month.
Billboard Bound, LLC., a women’s boutique, can be found on 4924 West field Avenue in Pennsauken, New Jersey. Jade Futch, owner of Billboard Bound, found the location by happenstance. “I was riding down the street and saw a for rent sign. I called the owner and she gave it to me. It’s the perfect location due to the surrounding businesses there is a lot of foot traffic,” Futch said.
Futch started the business at the age of 22 in July 2014. After attending several semesters at Temple University, she decided school was no longer something she wanted to pursue. “I’m a college drop out. I was very good at school but decided it wasn’t for me. The funny thing is I’m doing everything I wanted to do since I graduated high school,” Futch said. The boutique owner not only spends time making women feel like the best versions of themselves, but also splits her time working at Camden county police department.
Billboard Bound allows women ages 18 to 35 years old to “dress like they are already famous.” Futch sells everything wholesale, from clothing, accessories, to hair extensions. “Billboard Bound is not only a clothing store but a one stop shop. We have a makeup and lash studio on site and sell virgin hair extensions,” Futch said.
Opening a boutique was natural for Futch because of her love for fashion as well as her love for helping people find the right outfit for every occasion. “It comes easy to me. I love to shop and help others get ready for their special events, now I get to do it for a living,” Futch said.
The CEO plans to open a makeup and lash studio in a separate location called, Billboard Bound Beauty Bar.
Tanesha Hamilton, owner of Unforgettable Creations Catering and Neats Sweet Treats, lives in Lexington, North Carolina. She graduated from North Carolina State University with B.A. in Communications and a focus in Public and Interpersonal Communication. Hamilton also has an A.A.S. in Culinary Arts from Johnson and Wales University. She puts both degrees to work as a high foods and nutrition teacher as well as a part-time chef.
Hamilton turned her love of cooking into a business in October 2009 at the age of 23 years old, two months prior to her graduating from North Carolina State University. “My pastor challenged us to start something we enjoy doing but never saw ourselves making something out of it. It was then that I began to position myself upon college graduation to pursue a culinary degree,” Hamilton said. The chef explained that she always knew how to cook but it wasn’t until her senior year at North Carolina State University that she learned it was her passion. Upon graduating, Hamilton discovered her desire to bake. “I said throughout culinary school that I hated baking until someone asked me to bake a dessert; the rest is history,” Hamilton said.
Originally from a small town in Davidson County, North Carolina, Hamilton services the surrounding cities including Greensboro, Charlotte, and Winston-Salem. “I do not have a brick and mortar yet but I am able to bake out of my home. I rent a commercial kitchen for larger events,” Hamilton said. Unforgettable Creations Catering and Neats Sweet Treats is marketed at local events with vendors in North Carolina. Hamilton also takes food samples to businesses and passes out her food at her town’s mall along with business cards. “I’m currently a foods and nutrition teacher at a high school, so I make food for the office staff and other teachers and they pay me on holidays and special occasions to make their treats,” Hamilton said. She promotes her business mostly on the social media sites; Facebook and Instagram and posts flyers with business specials.
Even though Hamilton enjoys teaching, her ultimate goal is to cater and to bake full-time. “The kids love me, I like to give back and try to encourage them. I teach at a low performing low budget school. I love
to inspire my students and have had two students from my first year go to culinary school,” Hamilton said. She also teaches cooking classes at Williams Sonoma, a kitchen supply store in the malls of Winston Salem, Charlotte, and Greensboro, North Carolina.
LeJuan Samuel, CEO and Founder of Roc Da Block Entertainment, LLC. was the tender age of 17 years old when he founded the record company, but he officially started the business at 18 after receiving his fictitious business name. “I knew it was worth starting because I saw multi-million production deals happening before my eyes,” Samuel said.
“Coming from a home with a mother who is an educator, I did not have the option to fail,” Samuel said. In 1999, Samuel attended the University of Houston, where he studied Audio Engineering Programming and received his full Audio Production Certification. Samuel resides in the rural region of Woodlands, Texas.
Roc Da Block Entertainment is a production company that not only concentrates on music production but makes artist development. “I knew music was my passion because I thought of it every second of the day, it consumed my thoughts and my finances. I followed every magazine on music and read as many books as possible,” Samuel said. The record producer has worked with artists such as Vincent Herbert, Brandy, Scarface, Jodeci, Kim Burrell, John P. Kee, and Zacardi Cortez.
The record label owner strongly believes that the music business is in a great state, especially for producers. “Budgets are not the same as they use to be, however, a lot of labels and artists do not use their budgets properly,” Samuel said. He also thinks it is easier to establish a career due to easy internet access. “An artist does not really need a label to release material due to streaming services and online retail stores. This is definitely the era of the independent artist,” Samuel said. On the other hand, the majority of large record sales come from major labels. “It is always a good time to be in the music business if that’s the career you desire and are willing to work extremely hard to achieve your dreams and goals. If you plan on being in this business, you must do it for the love of music while having an abundance of knowledge to be successful,” Samuel said.
Financial expert Jamie Williams has nearly 20 years of experience and has worked for some of the nation’s largest nancial institutions, including Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers, and Deutsche Bank. Williams obtained his FINRA 7, 24, 63 licenses and has a Bachelor’s Degree from Temple University.
According to Williams, small businesses are good for the economy and account for the majority of new jobs. “While companies listed on the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices tend to be the most popular indicators of how well the economy is doing, small business success, I believe, are the true authentic economic barometer,” Williams said.
The finance guru supports individuals under 30 years old who start their own businesses, especially college students. “It’s one thing to sit through lectures, read books, write papers, take exams, graduate, and land a job with a company, but it’s been my experience that leaders and innovators generally are unfulfilled with the aforementioned path.” In 2018, you can “start a business with a computer and a great idea,” Williams said.
To start a successful business, you need a business model and a plan with capital to sustain the business during the infancy period. “Keep in mind that you don’t know everything; find a mentor. A qualified mentor can minimize exposure to the inevitable pitfalls of business,” Williams said. He also argues that to maintain a business, a CEO must be exible and must be open to altering the business model. “Be in tune with your consumer, understand their needs and above all make sure the product is meeting their needs. Know what you do well and identify your competitive advance,” Williams said.
A degree is not required to start a business. However, a degree does not hurt. A solid education can give a business owner the tools needed to have a long lasting, successful company, Williams said. “A good education can be the foundation and provide the building blocks and tools you need to be successful,” Williams said. Age does not determine success; maturity and experience do.
There is no denying it; many millennials today are taking a chance and opening both online and physical businesses.
