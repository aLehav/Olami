 Leah Mele, a senior sociology major, is the middle infielder on the softball team and plays second base. So far, she had a great season. 
Mele played baseball from the age of 3 to the age of 14, and she started playing softball in the seventh grade. Prior to becoming a Pioneer, she played on Longwood’s varsity softball team in high school, and on the LI Pride organization travel team. She also played volleyball and basketball. 
Baseball was always important to Mele because her father was a baseball player. She started playing softball because she wasn’t allowed to play baseball as a female. Mele was able to play travel baseball for the Long Island Falcons, but wasn’t allowed to play on her high school baseball team. However, after Mele started playing softball, she fell in love with the sport. She prefers softball over baseball because it’s a much faster sport and much more fun, in her opinion. 
Mele looks up to and admires her brother, who passed away when she was younger. He was a baseball player as well. “I play this game for him and my mom [who] also passed away. Each game that I go out there and play are always for them,” Mele said. She wears her brother’s baseball number in honor of him when she plays.
For Mele, the hardest part about being on the softball team is the amount of time and effort she puts into it every single day. The softball team practices almost everyday, and will play in around 50 games this semester. It is also difficult because she has to miss a lot of classes, so it can be hard to keep up.  However, her favorite part about playing softball is that it is a distraction from anything else going on in her life. 
She also learns valuable life lessons from being on the team. “The team’s dynamic is very family like. We are all sisters and will always have each others’ backs, no matter what.”
Mele considers her best game to be the one she played on March 24 against the University of Wilmington. She hit a walk off home run against a regional opponent, which was a great accomplishment to her. To Mele, a successful game is one in which her team wins and gets at least two hits with no strikeouts at the plate, and makes no errors in the field. Mele has a deep love and passion for softball, and intends to continue to work hard and keep on playing.

 The baseball team continued their success with a 17-2 record in the East Coast Conference and 26-12 overall with three wins over the Molloy Lions since Thursday, April 18. “We’re having great team chemistry this year. Our pitching and hitting have been working strong together to win us games,” Mike Manzione, senior infielder, said.    
On Thursday, April 18, it was a close game until the sixth inning when Molloy put up the first run, but the Pioneers quickly answered back with a run of their own to tie the game up on a Giovanni Ciaccio RBI. 
After Molloy reclaimed the lead in the end of the seventh inning, making the score 2-1, junior first baseman Zach Fritz delivered a three-run homerun giving the Pioneers a 4-2 lead. The Pioneers added to the lead with RBI’s from Manzione and sophomore outfielder Jahsiah Greene. “Guys coming in clutch, hitting home runs or getting on base so the next man up can drive them in has also helped,” Manzione said. 
Senior pitcher, James Varela earned his seventh win of the season, striking out five batters and only allowing two earned runs, and he pitched eight innings. “He has a lot of power, throws hard, and has an unbelievable slider,” Manzione said. The game ended 7-2 in favor for the Pioneers.   
On Saturday, April 20, the Pioneers had a doubleheader home game schedule, but due to weather conditions, it was moved to Molloy’s Mitchell Field in Rockville Center. They decided to play the game there because Molloy plays on a turf field while the Pioneers play on grass. “It doesn’t have an affect where we play, but we do miss playing at home,” Manzione said. “A lot of teams in the conference play on turf, so when we play at home on grass, other teams struggle with ground balls and reading hops,” he said.    
In game one of the doubleheader, the Pioneers took an early lead, scoring five runs in the first two innings, and they didn’t look back. RBI’s came from Fritz, senior infielder Rey Guillen, junior outfielder Andy Camilo, senior catcher Anthony Vaglica, and sophomore shortstop Chris Wasson. Junior pitcher Noah Lorenzo pitched a complete nine inning game earning himself his sixth win of the season. “Lorenzo is very crafty which makes it so difficult to hit off him,” Manzione said. “He has a great change-up which keeps hitters on their front foot and will come hard inside with his fastball.” The Pioneers won the first game with a score of 8-1.    
In game two, Molloy jumped ahead 2-0 in the beginning of the third inning. The Pioneers climbed back, evening the score to 2-2 when Wasson scored on a wild pitch and Guillen knocked in an RBI. 
The Pioneers took the lead when Vaglica hit a towering homerun over the left field fence making the score 3-2, which became the final result of the game. Junior pitcher Mike Stiles pitched a complete seven inning game, along with an eight-strikeout performance.    The Pioneers look to continue their dominance in the ECC as they take on rival NYIT this weekend in a Battle of the Boulevard match. Game one of the series is set for 3 p.m. Friday, April 26 at home.

 One of the most popular games among digital game design students is “Assassins Creed: Origins,” an open world game that was released on October 27, 2017. The game revolves around a man named Bayek, a Maji from Siwa, and takes place in ancient Egypt during the time of Cleopatra, last of the pharaohs. The game itself is phenomenal, but it’s the culture that  makes the game stand out from others.
“Assassins Creed: Origins” takes inspiration not only from the physical culture of Egypt, including the pyramids and towns, but also  from the beliefs of the people of the time. Through-out the game there are  references the Egyptian gods, their underworld, and what they consider heaven.As you go through the game, you meet the people of Egypt, who ask for your help. These quest givers often talk about Sobek, Anubis, Apep, and many other gods. There are also references to the Duat, the Egyptian underworld. When the player completes an assassination, a cutscene  begins where Bayek will speak with the dying target and tell them “The Lord of The Duat Awaits.” In Egyptian culture, the god he is talking about is named Osiris, who is the son of Apep, and in the game he is known as The Hidden One. 
Another god in the game is Sobek, the god of crocodiles and watcher of the Nile River; he is often depicted as a humanoid crocodile. In addition, there is Anubis, god of the dead, one of the major gods in Egyptian culture, who is depicted as a humanoid jackal and even has an outfit for Bayek to wear in the game.
Heaven is also referenced in the game. This paradise in the afterlife, known as “The Field of Reeds,” is where the people of Egypt wanted to live after they died. The Field of Reeds also known as A’aru, a mirror image of one’s life on earth and it is here that the Egyptians believed they would reunite with their loved ones.
The game is an amazing experience, not just because of the gameplay and story, but because players see how these people lived, who and how they worshipped, and take a step into a time long forgotten.

 HerStory Writers Workshop has been active on Long island for more than two decades, and on campus for the past few years. This semester, I had the opportunity to work with the HerStory Writers Workshop, that encourages women to write share their stories. Helen Dorado Alessi is one of six workshop facilitators and consultants who runs the workshop. She brought together 13 students from Westbury High School and 11 graduate and undergraduate students from Post to write alongside each other, sharing their own stories as to who made them the women they are today.
Alessi helps writers during the session find their “first page moment,” which according to novelist, essayist and founder of HerStory Writers Workshop, Erika Duncan, is where the reader finds themselves able to “walk in the writer’s shoes.”This means unlike writing an academic essay or research paper, HerStory teaches the writer to put the readers in the heart of the action, where the most action of the story begins.  
The students in the classroom had an array of stories, the high school students  discussed issues from immigration struggles to abuse. This experience allowed for the high school students to hear some of the college students stories about adapting to college life and discovering who they were, and to the pressures of being a student athlete. 
When selecting our stories to write, we first had to think of a moment in our lives that changed us. For a number of us in the room, thinking back to a time that changed us was hard, and often forced emotion to resurface. Topics raised included teen pregnancy, absent parents, poverty, addiction, and problems in both the healthcare and juvenile systems. These stories submitted through the HerStory organization are shared on Long Island Wins website and are written with the intention of getting published in one of HerStory’s books. 
There is plenty to be learned in the environment HerStory provides, past the writing skills like the degree of trust that the students learn to develop for each other, partnered with the honesty of the stories is a skill rarely learned in the classroom. 
Junior English and political science major Taylor Brodsky shared her experience. “Her-Story was one of the most meaningful things I’ve done in a class at Post,” she said. “I was pleasantly surprised by how well the program was put together and the impact that it had on me as a student,” Brodsky added. “The high school students involved  enjoyed the experience as well and it was really amazing to see the impact we had on younger students”
The participating students this semester are English or sociology majors, and taking the class for internship credit to satisfy the Eng 101 or Soc 92 requirement. But not all students were taking the class for college credit. “This writing project will engage public high school students in writing alongside college students, writing their stories together, building bridges across age, situation, and culture,” Dr Glynis Pereyra, interdisciplinary studies director said.

 The Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC) will present dynamic dance pieces in the Spring Dance Concert from April 26-28, many of which are choreographed by its members. An 8 p.m. performance will take place each night at the Little Theatre Mainstage, and an additional 2 p.m. matinee is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
PCDC, which consists of all dance majors, is committed to innovative and thoughtful new choreography. Members are required to take a course in choreography and are encouraged to do so during the first semester of sophomore year. The spring concert is a celebration of the dancers’ learning experiences, as well as the senior dancers who are the “life blood” of the program, according to Dr. Cara Gargano, chairperson of the theatre, dance and arts management department. 
At the end of each semester, the company produces a concert showcasing pieces arranged by  student members. The 2019 spring concert will include a company jazz and African number choreographed by seniors Mary Cate Bottenus and Lauren Hiraldo, who are graduating in May, and Josie McSwane, who plans to graduate in December. A pointe ballet number choreographed by Gargano will also be featured, along with a freshman class piece choreographed by adjunct professor of dance, Nancy Brier. 
Students who have completed the choreography course and have registered for the choreography practicum are eligible to put together a piece for the show, according to Bottenus. 
At the start of the semester, they fill out an application that includes a tentative title and music choice, a one sentence concept statement, and five items researched prior to choreographing and five items they plan to research while creating their piece.  
Bottenus’ research inspired the title of her contemporary piece: “7 Minutes.” “Something that I didn’t know is that every seven minutes someone is bullied. In the beginning, you don’t realize how potentially important it can be to do the research on your concept, but it worked great for me,” she said. 
This is Bottenus’ fifth time creating a piece for an end-of-semester concert, and she has chosen to choreograph to a speech instead of music. “Something I love aside from dance is working with kids with special needs. Everybody has experienced bullying in one way or another, whether you are a bystander, a victim, or the bully. So, I think it’s a very powerful piece,” she said. She plans to continue performing once she graduates; however, when her body finally tells her to call it quits, she hopes to combine her love of dance and working with special needs children by doing dance therapy.
Each dance’s concept is developed by the student choreographing; faculty is only there to guide and assist when needed. “Sometimes it’s really helpful to have another artistic perspective,” junior dance major and company member Andrew Teperdjian said. “I admit there are days where I just look at the piece and I want to change [something], and I have no idea what I want to do with it.” Teperdjian has also choreographed a piece for the concert that he describes as deep and spiritual.
McSwane, who also teaches at the Peconic Ballet Theatre in Riverhead, will feature an original piece with an important concept. “Mine is very kind of raw, and I wanted it to feel very human to the people who are watching it, and just kind of be drawn to the human experience even though it’s being shown through dance. It does have a message behind it, which I don’t want to give that away because I want it to be open to interpretation as well.”
Company members rehearsed in the evenings from 6:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. in preparation for the concert. Not only did they rehearse their choreographed pieces, but they also attend the scheduled rehearsals for the pieces they dance in, as well as the dances they under-study for. Each member must understudy for at least two pieces. “We dance a lot,” Bottenus said. “That’s why we’re here, and it’s great.” 
Gargano is proud of her senior dancers and how much they have grown artistically. “We rely on them not only to model the kind of aesthetic we expect but also to mentor the other dancers,” she said. “They know I have great faith in them. This is their opportunity to shine.” 
Tickets for the Spring Dance Concert can be purchased prior to showtime at www.Tix55.com for $15 each. LIU students can buy them at a discounted price of $10.

 The S.A.L. Gallery’s last exhibition of the semester was shown from April 17-22 
By Josh Tolentino
Assistant Features Editor
 Photographers Ashley Wilson and Erin Brotell showcased their exhibits in the S.A.L. Gallery in the library from April 17 to April 22. Wilson’s collection, “The Brave,” Brotell’s collection, “Chasing the Sun” contrasted each other and stood out in their own ways. 
Wilson, a senior photography major, did her project on something close to home, firemen.  Members of her family, including her dad, work for the FDNY. Wilson followed the Special Operations Firehouse with a 7300 mm lense. “I wanted to show everything they went through. It’s crazy, they don’t even think about running into a fire, they just do it,” Wilson said. 
She started working on her exhibition in September. It features photos of fires, rescues, and a funeral. “It hit home, but it was nice and eye-opening how many people, even if they didn’t know the family, were there to support them,”  Wilson said about the funeral she photographed.   
Brotell, also a senior photography major, premiered her exhibit “Chasing the Sun,” show-casing her use of light. “I am usually drawn to ethereal environments. I like to create images that you cannot see with your eye,” Brotell said. 
Taking her classmates into nature in places around campus, she tried to photograph their “inner goddesses.” Brotell uses light to create alternate realities, immersing viewers in dreamlike experiences. The images were not easy to create; when shooting, Brotell only had a window of 15 minutes of where the sun should be before it changed angles and altered the shot.
“The Brave” and “Chasing the Sun” were the last exhibits of the S.A.L .Gallery for the spring semester. The photographers managed to capture emotions without words.

 Myles Goldman is a fifth-year senior jour-nalism major who has covered sports for the Pioneer for two years. As graduation gets closer, he looks back at his time in college with mixed emotions. It has occasionally consisted of disappointments and failure, but in the very end excitement, new friendships and a new-found love, journalism. “It has been a journey,” Goldman said. 
Goldman declared himself a forensic science major as a junior after being undecided for two years. Goldman was thrilled to go into the criminology field. “I found it very interesting,” he said. What seemed like a perfect match soon proved to be an unbearable challenge. “It was so hard, especially the chemistry part. It’s like learning a new language,” Goldman said. “I would study 18 hours a day and still fail.” 
Journalism became Goldman’s rescue. He got involved with the school newspaper and a new spark awakened. “I remember my first article. It was a review for ‘IT,’ the movie, and I remember when I saw the article. I was like ‘Wow, here it is. I’m a part of something,’” he said. “It felt like victory.” 
Goldman became the paper’s sports editor, and although he is interested in sports, he doesn’t see himself in sports journalism in the future. “I’ll take the job, but I would like to expand and write about other stuff,” he said.
Goldman chose journalism because the field has many outlets. He likes to spend time behind his camera, and he has had the chance to explore the filmmaking field thanks to his new major. “I’ve learned a lot of filmmaking skills at school, especially from professor Kathy Dalton,” he said. 
Besides gaining skills and developing his passion for journalism during his senior year, Goldman has spent a lot of time in the game room in Hillwood which has generated in new friendships. “I love those guys over there and I bond with them in ways I can’t with other people,” he said.  
Currently, Goldman works as a freelance journalist for Blank Slate Media, and after graduation he hopes to get a job at a newspaper. He plans to start small and then see what happens. “I want things to happen organically,” he said. 
Even though Goldman’s path to graduation has not been what he expected it to be, he is happy with where he is right now. “There has been a lot of upsetting moments, but over the year, the amazing things have almost out-weighed the bad moments and I’m happy,” he said.
Goldman wants to send an additional thanks to the Pioneer’s advisor, Carolyn Schurr Levin, and the paper’s editors-in-chief, Ashley Bowden and Jada Butler. “I cannot thank them enough,” he said. “I’m really going to miss the Pioneer. I have nothing but love for my team.”

 Matthew Sollenne, senior accounting major, has fond memories to look back on after he graduates in May. Having spent four years on the Pioneer football team as a offensive lineman, Sollenne considers the highlights of his college career to be the time spent bonding with his teammates. 
“They’re all good guys. I’ve lived with and next to my teammates for the past four years so we’ve all gotten really close,” Sollenne said. He is a commuter student from Massapequa. “Winning two championship games was Sollenne’s proudest moment as a Pioneer. “It was amazing. Winning a regular football game is a feeling you can’t really describe,” he said. “And then for it to be a championship game just makes the feeling so much better.” During his sophomore year, Sollenne and the team celebrated a 43-23 victory over Assumption College. In the 2018 season, the Pioneers won 17-13 against New Haven University.
 Sollenne has taken part of several community service events including food drives at a local high school and food kitchens. “We did a lot of help with physically and mentally challenged people like bowling leagues, little things here and there,” Sollenne said. 
The Pioneer relies on a circulation manager to deliver copies of the paper around the campus, a job Sollenne has done for three years. “Every Wednesday morning, I pick up the newspapers and I deliver them to different buildings around campus before class starts and before people are really on campus,” Sollenne said. He gets up as early as 6:30 a.m. to start this routine. Sollenne looks forward to having no more classes once he graduates. “Not having a job, I’m not ready for that,” Sollenne said. “Having a steady income would be nice.” He is currently looking for jobs in the Philadelphia area and plans to work in accounting.

 Morgan Kashinsky is eager to see what her future holds after graduation. Kashinsky is a criminal justice major with a deep love for politics, and she has part of the student government since last spring. She is also the senior class president. “My heart is in it for bettering society and making the country a better place,” Kashinsky said. She transferred from George Washington University in spring 2017. 
One of Kashinsky’s favorite memories during her time at Post is when she interviewed former congressperson Steve Israel on his book, “Big Guns” in front of an audience of about 40 people. For Kashinsky, it was great to get this kind of hands-on experience. Another favorite memory is when she met Joe Biden who she really admires for his advocacy of women’s rights.
 Kashinsky helped restart the College Democrats in October 2017. “I really just wanted to help the students because I felt like student voices weren’t being heard, but I feel like this year student government has worked really hard to make sure that student voices are heard, and I think we’re building a great relationship with the administration,” Kashinsky said.
Kashinsky’s advisor, Luke Connors, has helped her a tremendous amount and she is extremely thankful for him. “Luke went beyond just helping me sign up for classes; he’d even give me professional contacts within the field of politics, she said. She is also extremely thankful for all of the great professors she’s had who really want to get to know and help their students.
Kashinsky plans to work for a year after graduation  in the political field, while she applies to law schools. She hopes to be accepted to NYU.

 Griffin Albrecht, a political science major and journalism minor, transferred to Post in 2017. Before then, he attended the University of Vermont. “I was transferring in because I wanted to do something different,” he said. “I was looking to get more involved [in] opportunities and internships and stuff like that in the summertime.”
Albrecht has enjoyed attending Post because the commuter nature of the school made it more realistic than the traditional college experience. “People are working, they have other jobs, a lot of older students are here too; people who are either coming back to school or going at nights.”
Seeing former presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush live at the Tilles Center is Albrecht’s favorite memory. “Having that opportunity was awesome. I had friends who went to Georgetown and they said ‘we don’t get Bush.’ It was a big deal.” Albrecht still has the ticket stub, which he keeps on his desk.

 Alecia Sexton, a senior health and physical education major, has been on campus for two years. She transferred after her sophomore year from Westchester University, where she majored in nutrition. She changed her major at Post because she “realized how much I liked the teaching aspect of health, rather than fixing problems that have already arisen, and I really love kids,” she said. 
She has been busy during her two years on campus. “I have taken a lot of method courses, so we go out to schools all over the Island, high, middle and elementary, and we teach health classes and physical education classes, and that’s been really helpful in getting my foot in the door and helping get me used to the school environment,” Sexton said. 
Sexton also filled her days with work as the Layout Editor and weekly health columnist for the Pioneer. “I love writing. I always loved writing, I almost majored in journalism from out of high school because really I like informative writing, to educate people and helping,” she said. She blended her loves for health, being active and writing in her column.
Sexton plans to look for a job in the health or physical education field after graduation. “I am planning on student teaching, doing anything I can to get into school districts all over the Island and just get my name out there,” she said.
She hopes to inspire another health columnist to take up her work. “It’s very valuable for students to have some kind of source for healthy reading, for healthy living. . . because of so many political things out there and all this other information being thrown at them, and they tend to neglect their health,” she said. 
Sexton leaves this advice for juniors about to enter their final year: “Senior year is tough, you get a lot of assignments and it feels longer then it is, but just keep your eye on that goal of the diploma in hand and the stable job, and you can do it.”

 Political science major and writing minor Josh Tolentino, is known as a comedic force by many around campus. With a distinctive sense of humor, as well as the perfect mix of humble-ness and confidence, he has a way of lightening the mood each time he enters a room. Whether you’re his classmate or professor, his quick-wit and ability to make people laugh will be missed once he graduates this May. 
Tolentino originally considered majoring in journalism, but instead chose political science because it offered more electives. His decision veered him into a course with political science professor, Dr. Michael Soupios, who Tolentino said helped him realize a lot about himself. “Soupios is one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever met,” he said. Soupios described Tolentino as a student he found to be honest, intelligent, caring and trustworthy. “Whenever I spoke to him, l was always confident he would not only grasp the subtleties but also be discrete in presenting the material. A good guy- I will miss him very much,” he said.
Tolentino is a natural when it comes to presentation. Stand-up comedy is more than his dream. It’s his passion. “The best part about being a comic is being on stage. I’ve had crazy nights, but nothing compares to going on stage in front of a great crowd.”
Senior journalism major and political psychology minor Jada Butler, who began dating Tolentino last spring, believes his sense of humor is his greatest attribute. 
“He has this unique perspective of seeing things,” she said. “He’s open minded and energetic with a very passionate drive.” She admires the way he looks for the good in his bad days, as well as his ability to find the humor in an awkward situation. 
Tolentino said his greatest success is discovering that the world of comedy is where he belongs. “I found a place that I enjoy and that I’m happy to be a part of,” he said. When he has a bad day, he enjoys passing by the Comic Strip Live venue in NYC and attending late-night gigs where he and his friends roast one another while waiting to perform. 
Tolentino will also miss having class with Dr. Jennifer Cusumano, an adjunct professor in the department of communications and film, who he calls “Cus” for short. “Cus kind of left an impact on me. Dude, she was the first professor I had here,” he said. 
Cusumano has watched him grow as a student and person over the past four years. She believes his inquisitiveness, along with his desire to make a statement and be creative, sets him apart from the rest. “Josh has shown real maturity and professionalism in always wanting to challenge himself, always stretching his abilities and taking on new tasks,” she said.
 Tolentino’s future after Post is uncertain, and he’s a bit nervous about “facing the unknown,” he said. He’s passing on grad school because he wants to remain debt free. His only debt is a small late fee owed to his local library because he forgot to return a “Boys Like Girls” album, and he wants to keep it that way. “The thing is, I’m never going to pay that $70 because one day all the libraries are going to close, so I’m waiting them out,” he said.
 Tolentino’s wish is to keep doing stand-up for the rest of his life and to make money while doing it. He considers comedy his call of duty, and every so often, he reminds himself why he started. “You’ll realize something is your dream when you keep going but it sucks. That’s how you know you love doing it. That’s how you find your passion.” His advice to himself and other striving performers is, “Enjoy the ride. Don’t let a good show go to your head and a bad one to your heart.”

 After six years, three majors, and three colleges, Christian “Klim” Klimaszewski will graduate this spring 2019 with a BFA in Broadcasting.
“It feels surreal and really satisfying that I’m finally graduating college,” Klimaszewski said. He began his college journey at Western New England University in Springfield, Mass., where he spent one semester as a sports management major. 
Klimaszewski transferred to Nassau Community College as a physical education major for two and a half years before he made a final move to Post in fall 2016. At Post, he continued studying physical education and joined Greek Life as a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE). After almost three years, Klimaszewski was sure he was going down the right path. Yet the end of his path will lead him across a stage to receive a diploma for a BFA in Broadcasting, not in phys-ed. 
“Radio was always something I wanted to do, but I figured it was something I could do as a hobby,” he said. It was his SAE big brother Greg Vavrinec who convinced him to join WCWP, the campus radio station, in February 2017. “I fell in love with it ever since then.”
“I knew he was a sports guy, so I brought him around to help me with a project and he just gravitated to the station,” said Vavrinec, who graduated in spring 2018. Klimaszewski was a natural and got involved at the station immediately as a member of the sports department. “He has a bright future ahead of him and it’s truly a privilege to be friends, and more importantly, brothers,” Vavrinec said. 
Senior year is the first time he’s taken 18 credits a semester, during both the fall and spring, which he needed to complete in order to graduate. But Klimaszewski said the pressure was no sweat. “Last semester, I actually did really well. I had a 3.3 GPA, and I’m still managing to do that now with all that I’m doing,” he said. 
From participating in philanthropic events with SAE, to being a commentator for the Pioneers’ lacrosse, football and baseball games for WCWP Sports, reporting on campus news and events for The Pioneer, and co-hosting the Friday 2 p.m. podcast “Phenomenal Forum,” Klimaszewski has left his mark at Post. 
Klimaszewski’s extracurriculars helped shape where he sees himself in 10 or 15 years. His dream is to get a job on the air with his own sports radio show on ESPN, WFAM, or the sports and pop culture blog, Barstool Sports. No matter how high the dream is, Klimaszewski is willing to start low and climb his way up to the top. “I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m willing to travel wherever I have to go to make this dream come true, whether it’s Georgia, Virginia, the Carolinas –  anything like that,” he said. 
His summer plans are still open, but his next steps are to search for entry-level jobs at media companies like NBC, CBS, WFAM, and ESPN. He is looking for open positions as an assistant producer or a writer.
Coming to the end of the 2018-2019 school year, Klimaszewski can proudly look back with no regrets. He’s learned many life lessons from finding his footing in academia, attending community college, and facing some personal challenges. “It’s helped me build who I am today,” he said. “I look at all of this stuff I’ve been through and there’s no regrets – no regrets at all in my life.”

 Although Anand Venigalla is in his third year at Post, he will graduate this May because he has earned college credits in high school. Venigalla is majoring in English literature with a minor in philosophy. 
One of his best memories at Post was meeting a girl in his class who was working for the campus magazine, the Bottom Line. This inspired him to join and contribute to the Pioneer. 
“I decided to go to the meeting when this was available during my freshman year and I wanted to find a way to make myself feel more at home with this University. I went to it and decided to write for this magazine. The first thing I wrote as I remembered was a set of confessions on what students thought about the 2016 elections,” Venigalla said.
Venigalla said this is how he discovered the Pioneer newspaper, which was the parent of the Bottom Line then, and how he came to contribute to it and work as the Features Editor this year.
Another positive memory Venigalla has from his years at Post was his first meeting at WCWP campus radio station. “I went there and from there on I got familiar with the studio and became a staff member and started producing a podcast called ‘Letter of Liberty,’” he said. 
Although he does not produce his podcast currently due to lack of time, he produced a fair number of episodes in which he inter-viewed professors outside of the country and other guests who he was fond of. 
There are some things Venigalla wished he had done while at Post. “I would’ve liked to get more involved on campus and would’ve liked to have gotten experience in dating while in college, so I felt like that was lacking. I also wish I could’ve socialized more in ways that helped me interact more casually,” he said. 
In terms of academics, Venigalla wishes he could have explored history and political science more. “I am satisfied with the courses I’ve been taking in English and philosophy, but I wish I could’ve broadened my horizons in some ways,” he said. 
Venigalla shared the lessons he has learned as a student attending Post. “Take every opportunity you find and whatever your heart is driven to, whatever your academic and intellectual interests are, go into those fields and get to know your faculty very well and get to know the sets of people you are working with,” Venigalla said. “And always be willing to make new friends and always get to know others.” 
Venigalla plans to go into law school and become a lawyer or a journalist. He will be taking a year off before graduate school.

 The swimming team gained a record-breaking athlete from overseas in 2015 when Karis Fuller, a senior sociology major and journalism minor, was added to the roster. Fuller, who is from London, England, decided to attend college in New York because she was offered a swim scholarship and there were a lot of international members on the Pioneer team.
Her fondest memories of her time as a Pioneer revolve around her time on the swimming team, ever since her freshman year when the Pioneers won their fourth consecutive conference title. 
Breaking her former teammate Seren Jones’ record in the 100-meter backstroke “was a really great experience,” Fuller said. “Every Nationals has been incredible because I get to meet incredible athletes and see a sport I’ve grown up around.” Now that she will retire from her swimming career of 14 years, Fuller looks forward to taking a vacation unrelated to swimming.
Some advice Fuller gives to her freshman self is “don’t try so hard,” and “don’t think so much,” she said. While giving effort to classes and sports is important, the key is not to be stressed about it. “You know what you’re doing, just let your heart take the lead and leave your head at home,” Fuller said. “I didn’t find what I was particularly good at until sophomore year,” Fuller said about swimming and academics. Having started on the swimming team as a distance swimmer, she holds the record for the 1,650-meter race at 17:20.04. Now, she specializes in the backstroke and holds a record of 54 seconds in the 100-meter backstroke race. 
“Joining the paper was a great thing for me to do, and I wish I’d done that earlier,” Fuller said. She is the Arts and Entertainment Editor of the Pioneer and previously was the Assistant Arts and Entertainment Editor.
“I’m not going to miss Winnick, but I am going to miss the fact that I don’t have to cook for myself,” Fuller said about the conveniences of dorming. She will also miss the freedom that comes with being a university student. “I have no responsibilities really when I’m here,” she said. Normal days for Fuller tend to consist of classes and swim practice before waking up to repeat the same schedule the next day. “There’s no breaks in my routine, which I’m going to have to get used to post-graduation, she said.
For Fuller, the best part of college has been meeting her teammates and getting to live with her best friend on campus. Her roommate since 2015 now lives in Brooklyn, so Fuller enjoys going off-campus to go visit her. “I get to see what living in the city is like, and I also get to see the struggle of work life,” Fuller said. International students can do Optional Practical Training (OPT) for one year in their desired field of work after graduation. “She’s doing that, so I’m getting to see the hardships I’m going to have to face about finding a job, paying rent; what real life is going to be like,” Fuller said.
After graduating, Fuller plans to take a trip to Bali. “I’m getting away from Long Island, see a real beach,” she said. Eventually, she wants to work at a publishing house, but she’s going to start at a smaller job to save up for her two-month vacation. “I think I need to enjoy being a non-athlete and being a regular person for a little bit,” she said.

 Graduation is often seen as a time to reflect on the past and contemplate the future. For Angelique D’Alessandro, political science major and journalism minor, who will be graduat-ing this year, it’s a chance to set new goals and reaffirm old ones. She plans to start a political career, practice law and give back to her com-munity using experience from both.
D’Alessandro began her college career at the University of Alabama, where she studied political science and was a member of the sorority Delta Zeta. Missing home and wanting to be closer to her family is what made her transfer to Bard University in fall 2016 to study classical voice. She then transferred to Post in fall 2017 as a political science major. 
Community is important to D’Alessandro, to the point that she joined a few on her arrival. “I initially got here and felt like it was a much smaller community than in Alabama. I was able to find a chapter of Delta Zeta here, so I transferred my membership and found a wonderful community of sisters,” D’Alessandro said. She later joined the Pioneer and was able to “report and spread truth” as a staff writer and assistant online editor. She moved up to assistant news editor, and then executive editor in her senior year. 
“I also got involved in student government and found a great community there,” she said. She joined the student government association in 2017 as the transfer student senator, and senate advisor the next year. “Going into Post, I was apprehensive of what my experience would be coming in as a transfer, but now leaving Post, I realize that I have made a wonderful community here and had a lot of great opportunities.”
Throughout her college career she has had five internships, first at The Island Now as community for the online paper, then as a reporter for Newsday, at the Nassau County District Attorney’s office where she worked on files and observed court proceedings, at the Suffolk County Court under Judge C. Randall Hinrichs, and is currently interning in Manhattan at the Business Integrity Commission. She also had two fellowships, one under former Congressman Steve Israel in the LIU Global Institute, and one as a presidential fellow for the Center for the Study of Presidency and Congress, where she visited panels in Washington D.C., wrote papers on presidential rhetoric and immigration reform from 1986 to today.
D’Alessandro advises journalism students to never underestimate the importance of their jobs and the power they hold to better their community; she advises law students to keep up with current events in the country and abroad to stay on top; and she advises freshmen to get involved with as many organizations as they can to discover their true passions.
Her next steps are to go into law. “My goal is to go to law school and have a successful career as a lawyer,” she said. “I also plan to potentially go into politics and use what I’ve learned to help people in the future.”

 Olivia Kavanaugh is a senior art education major and the Vice President of the Student Government Administration (SGA). She is spending the spring 2019 semester student teaching at Babylon Jr/Sr High School and Cantiague Elementary School. 
She is also working on her senior art show “which felt like a visual of my accomplishments in the art department here,” she said. “Working on an art show while student teaching was one of the hardest but most rewarding things I’ve done, and having my work on display has really encouraged me and reminded me to work on my art work while pursuing teaching,” Kavanaugh said.
Although student teaching is time-consuming, Kavanaugh said she’s going to take a step back to think about the art she wants to make now and in the future.
In her free time, Kavanaugh enjoys watching movies. “I’m a big movie buff. I could spend a whole day watching movies and researching them. And aside from that, I thoroughly enjoy photography,” she said. 
Kavanaugh had many good experiences on campus. “I’ve had so many positive experiences here at Post, from welcoming in classes of students as an orientation leader for three years to serving as the Panhellenic President,” she said. These experiences have increased her leadership skills and allowed her to meet people that she hopes to know for many years after graduating. 
Kavanaugh says that, along with the positive experiences, she had some negative experiences as a resident assistant in the dorms. “But, with that position, the negatives do come with the positives,” she said.
Kavanaugh’s advice to incoming freshmen is to “just enjoy college. If it means getting involved in as much as they can then that’s just wonderful. If they want to excel in their major then that’s great too. Everyone has their own version of having a college experience but they should live up what they have in their mind to the full extent.”
Following graduation, Kavanaugh plans to apply for teaching jobs, both in New York City and on Long Island, so that she can continue to work hard towards what she is passionate about.

 Gabriel Amato, a senior musical theater major from Buffalo, New York, has had a passion for acting since beginning high school. “Around junior year of high school, I realized I wanted to really try to be an actor for a living, so I came to the summer honors institute in musical theater,” Amato said. 
The thrill of being on stage is exhilarating for Amato, who loves being able to share a story and a specific message to a group of people.
Amato performed in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Cinderella” as part of the ensemble and understudied Prince Topher and Jean Michael with Work Light Productions from Sept. 2017 to July 2018, presenting the big theme of the play, kindness. He has toured in 36 states, and in Canada.
When Amato isn’t on stage, he enjoys relaxing in the campus garden and participating in the Emerging Student Theater Association (ESTA). ESTA is a student-run club for those in the theater department. Students propose different ideas for shows and productions and put on two to three shows a semester, ranging from improv to full productions of musicals.
“My favorite part about Post is the sense of community we have in the theater program and the nature on campus; watching the seasons change all year round up close and personal is always nice,” Amato said.
Some of Amato’s favorite classes have been dance classes with Nancy Brier, and sociology with Eric Lichten.
Amato’s favorite memory at Post was attending the Kesha concert during his freshman year and competing with the cheer team in his sophomore year and “getting second in the nation for our division,” he said.
Amato offered advice to other students. “Know that this is the beginning to the rest of your life: it might not start out the way you planned and you’ll definitely change your mind about a thousand times. But as long as you are putting your best foot forward and living your truth, the right path will unfold in front of you. And sleep. Sleep is really important,” he said.

Happiness does more than make us happy. True happiness has the power to give us confidence that we never knew we had and inspires us to be the best version of ourselves. 
Experiencing joy or positive well-being combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile, according to clinical psychologist and Ph.D professor at Stanford University, Sonja Lyubomirsky, is harder to come by. 
Research done by the American Psychological Association has concluded that one pathway to happiness, oddly enough, may be letting yourself experience negative emotions and thoughts without hesitation. Trying to suppress negative emotions and bottling up unpleasant thoughts have been shown to decrease energy levels and lead to a weakened immune system. 
So, even though anger, jealousy, fear and
worry are all wicked emotions to experience,
it may be more beneficial to acknowledge the
feeling, accept it, and let it pass.

Another consideration for happiness may be the overall outlook we have on life and on situations. When we go into situations anticipating them to go south, then, regardless of the actual outcome, they will be perceived to have gone south. 
On the other hand, if we look at situations, even difficult ones, as being positive, or we consider what we may learn or get out of a difficult situation, then our thoughts and bodies reflect that and happiness results. 
Dr. Lyubomirsky concluded in her article, “The Happiness Diet,” that reflecting on happy moments and thinking about loved ones for simply eight minutes per day can have a mind- set changing effect on our own happiness. Think of it as eight minutes of “training” to wire happiness neurons to your brain. Once they’re wired, then they can be used all day, everyday, leaving you feeling whole and fulfilled. 
A good chunk of your happiness is in your own hands, what changes are you going make to ensure that life is ‘meaningful and worth-while’? The possibilities are endless.

Sara Panarelli, who was the director of LIU Promise, left the university on Wednesday, April 10. When the departments of campus life and Promise merged in January 2018, Panarelli served as a point of contact for students inquiring about campus engagement and academics. As the director, Panarelli worked with students starting at orientation. She welcomed them to the school by guiding them on campus tours, and helping new students become acclimated to the university. She also provided information about campus clubs and available resources. 
Panarelli’s most important task was assisting students to get where
they needed to be academically and personally. She helped students
with their resume development, internships, club involvement, course
choices, and to make progress towards their degrees.

The first class that Panarelli began with is graduating this May. She
admired the energy around campus. “I loved it here; I loved LIU,” she
said about her years at Post.

With just a couple of weeks remaining, Panarelli was unable to finish the spring semester. Others in the Promise office will fill in for her during her absence to give students a smooth transition, and to avoid problems for the remainder of the semester. Her responsibilities will be delegated to the director of student engagement, success coaches, and the Promise staff. 
Panarelli said that she was offered a good career opportunity, and
said “professionally, it’s a good time and a good move.” However, she
has many friends on campus and plans to attend events at the Tilles
Center, as well as athletic games.

The library regularly goes through a process of analyzing the books in its collection, updating and replacing books as new ones are acquired. 
Natalia Tomlin, an associate professor and librarian, explained the ongoing process. “The books go through a selection process detailing which will be exchanged, discarded or renewed. Some of the ways we do this is if a book is in poor physical condition, we may exchange it for an electronic version of that book or buy a copy that is in better condition.” This weeding process is used by all public and special libraries, Tomlin said. The only type of library that doesn’t weed books is an archive library. 
Through the process of collection development, the library acquires books as well as online sources. In that process, books and other sources may be discarded because they “no longer serve the purpose of our collection,” Tomlin said. 
Certain books are maintained because they are needed for classes. The librarians involved in the collection development process take a class in library sciences to acquire the skills, tools, and online sources needed to determine which books stay and which books leave the collection. 
What happens to the books that may be discarded? “In the rare case the books are so damaged to the point where they can’t be sold, read or repaired, they are recycled with along with the bottles, cans, and other recyclable material produced at the school,” Tomlin said. Other books are donated to Better World Books. 
Students who learned of the discarding of
books were upset by the process. One student
said she recovered some books from the trash
and took them home for her own personal
library.

“People love books, so if I see a book
thrown on the ground, I get upset because I
have a lot of respect for books,” Tomlin said.
“You know books are knowledge, books are
friends, so it’s natural to get upset. And we see
books as something good, so when students see
the books being mistreated in some way, such
as for example, see them tossed in piles, we get
the wrong idea,” Tomlin said.

LIU Promise hosted a Student Leadership Reception in the Tilles Atrium on April 22 from 5 to 7 p.m., honoring student club and Greek leaders. 
Joseph Vernace, associate director of Promise, said that the event is meant to showcase the hard work of students involved on campus. 
“LIU Promise and the division of student life and student success is committed to the high achieving students that we serve, and one of the greatest pleasures of our position is to recognize student leaders for all the amazing things they do throughout the year,” Vernace said. “This is a really special night to come together.” 
Taylor Rosenking, a senior biology major,
came to the event to support her sorority, Delta
Zeta, which won three of the Fraternity and
Sorority awards. The sorority won the Service
Award, Scholarship Award, and was recognized
as one of the Chapters Exceeding the Standard.

“I’m supporting the [Delta Zeta] executive
board’s hard work from last year,” Rosenking
said.

Paris Romano, a sophomore graphic design
major, also attended the event to support his
fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa, which won two
Fraternity and Sorority awards. The fraternity
was awarded the Scholarship Award and was
one of the Chapters Exceeding the Standard.

“I hope we continue in the future to reach the expectation,” Romano said. Each chapter is expected to reach the standards set out by Promise, and those who “exceed the standard” are recognized for it. 
Other award winners were Christina Lynch, a junior speech language pathology major who won both the Dr. John Farkas Memorial Student Leadership award and the Resident Assistant of the Year award, Gabrielle Barone, a junior psychology major who won the LIU Ambassador award, and Paul Usak, a senior business major who won the Dean of Students’ Award for Leadership and Scholarship.

Dear Post Community,

As we say goodbye to the spring 2019 semester, we’ve had the chance to reflect on our time spent thus far serving the campus on the Pioneer. We’ve made many mistakes, and we’ve also celebrated many successes. As student reporters, we’ve learned much through trial and error and strive to meet our journalistic ethical standards. But none of this could be possible without the undying support and guidance from our advisor, Professor Carolyn Schurr Levin. She has been a member of the faculty for 16 years, and advisor to the Pioneer for eight years. 
Levin played a key role in bringing the
campus newspaper back to life. After former
members of the campus administration shut
down the Pioneer by closing its website, Levin
initiated the publication’s revival in 2011, the
year she took on the role of faculty advisor.

In the same year, the Pioneer received an award for its re-launch. “The presidents of the New York Publishers Association drove down from Albany to give us an award for resurrecting the school newspaper,” Levin said. 
The first two editors-in-chief since Levin began working as faculty advisor were Samantha Bishal, and Kayla Krause. “We redid everything; there was nothing,” Levin said. She recalled the Pioneer offices being covered with repulsive graffiti. “It was awful. So the first thing we did was have the office painted,” Levin said. 
She took the initiative to revive the Pioneer and make it better than ever, from helping write detailed job descriptions for members of the staff’s editorial board to advising reconstruction of the website. 
The staff grew and became more solidified. “We started with procedures where the editors trained assistant editors and they groomed themselves up,” Levin said. Previously, the Pioneer was understaffed and less organized. “It has become so much more professional in eight years than it used to be.” 
Professor Levin has been a dependable pillar that the Pioneer has relied on for years. She’s an essential part of the Pioneer and cares deeply about the newspaper and its staff. She is well-versed and experienced in the field of journalism and media law, and gives advice and insight we wouldn’t be able to come across anywhere else. Levin goes out of her way to make sure every member of the staff as doing their best work, and she contributes her knowledge so we can make each issue of the Pioneer better than the last. 
To add to our ongoing series this semester, we wanted to celebrate Professor Levin as the true unsung hero she is. Not only a trusted advisor, but a beloved mentor by many. We don’t know where the Pioneer would be today without her dedication. 
Thank you, Professor Levin, for all that you have taught us, and continue to teach us every day. Ethics, integrity, professionalism, self-respect and self-awareness; these are life lessons we will carry with us long after we’ve graduated and begun our careers in the field that you opened up to us. We look forward to many more successful issues! 
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts,

Jada & Ashley 
The Pioneer Staff

Commencement for the 2019 graduating class will be held on Friday, May 10 at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium at 10:45 a.m. This is the second year it is being held at the stadium; in past years it was held on the lawn in front of Humanities. 
The 61st commencement will celebrate graduates from LIU Post, Brentwood, and Riverhead campuses and will combine the undergraduate class and the graduate class in one ceremony instead of two separates ones. 
Over 1,000 students are expected to participate in this year’s graduation ceremony. There is open seating for family and friends of the graduates. In the event of inclement weather, commencement will move to the Pratt Recreation Center, which will have limited seating. Graduates received three tickets for the rain date when they picked up their cap and gown at the graduation fair. 
During the ceremony, each
student will be recognized by
name and have their photo taken
as they cross the stage to receive

Jordan Lauterbach (‘10) and Rich Degnan, the director of track and field from 2004-2007, received awards from the National Scholastic Athletic Foundation (NSAF) for their contributions to the sport of track and field. The awards were presented at The Armory in New York City on March 10. 
At most sporting events, the athletes take home the awards, but these awards were different. Lauterbach and Degnan were honored for their knowledge and passion for track and field. 
Degnan, a life-long track and field enthusiast and current tutor at the Learning Support Center received the Mike Byrnes Coach of The Year award as coach for Massapequa boy’s winter and spring track, where he still coaches. Degnan is a certified official for the New York State and USA Track and Field (USATF) and director of staffing and operations at Foundation Running Camps, a summer running camp held for children at Camp Pontiac in Westbury. 
Degnan has received other awards for
track, including the Colbert Britt award for
coaching excellence by the Nassau coaches in
2016 and the Nassau Officials Award in 2017.
This award was special to him as Mike Byrnes,
who the award was named after, was a mentor
to him. Byrnes co-founded the NSAF in 1989.

“When I was told I was receiving the
Mike Byrnes award as the National Coach of
the Year, I was extremely surprised and very
honored having known Byrnes as a mentor of
mine,” Degnan said.

Lauterbach, who graduated with a degree
in journalism, was awarded the Allen Dawson
Award for contributions to track and field in his
reporting for Newsday. Since joining Newsday
in 2012 in the high school sports department,
Lauterbach has been covering track and field.
The sport was new to him before he started to
cover meets.

During his college years, Lauterbach spent time at the campus radio station covering sports. “I did everything there. I did play by play for football, women’s basketball on occasion, but the main thing I did was a daily talk show called ‘The Sports Wire” and I did it with my friends Max Caster and Matt Soldano,” Lauterbach said.

Senior art therapy major Maria Salazar exhibited her work, “Metamorphosis” in the Sculpture Gallery, from April 17 to 24. Guests admired 10 of Salazar’s original sculptures by Salazar. 
The theme of “Metamorphosis” is the potential for post-traumatic growth. “Through art you use your pain to create beauty,” Salazar said. “Life sometimes is not easy and you have moments where you have traumatic experiences, but I feel like you can overcome that, learn from it, and become something new. Almost like a metamorphosis.” 
Salazar is a Marine Corp veteran and bases much of her artwork on her own past experiences. “I’ve had a lot of life changing experiences in my life. I always try do, like, a self discovery and exploration. I try to understand how it affected me and what came of it. I am always using new experiences in my life to create my art.” 
Salazar became interested in sculpting
while attending a veterans workshop at the
ceramics studio on the far edge of campus. This
was the first time she ever made anything out
of clay, but it was far from the last. “Because of
that I took ceramics the next semester. Once I
found it I just fell into it, I loved it, I’m addicted
to it now.”

Showing her exhibit made Salazar feel very
happy, but also very exposed. “It was a little
bit overwhelming. I felt exposed because this
was very personal art, but at the same time I
felt very validated. It kind of came full circle, I
really tried to incorporate everything I learned
from my whole time here at LIU, from my very
first foundations class to my last semester.”

The exhibit’s reception brought together many of Salazar’s friends, old and new, and other members of the community. “It was awesome to see all the support and to have all my different communities come together. I had a lot of military people here yesterday, people from the ceramics studio, it was a whole very collective crew that combined here last night, and I was so taken back by it,” she said.

Three professors were honored this spring with the David Newton Award, the highest teaching award given by Long Island University. These professors were Nicholas J. Ramer, associate professor of chemistry; Maria Porter, professor of theater; and Jennifer Snekser, assistant professor of biology. 
Porter enjoys teaching theater. “I have taken my students with me to theater festivals around the world. They have won awards. I performed with my students at the Kennedy Center many years ago,” she said. “I am particularly fond of and grateful for their ability to fully embrace the rigorous teaching method that I have, that is a hybrid between a Suzuki method and the Stanislavski system.” These are methods of training that help the performer create physical and psychological actions. 
“When you’re in the commercial paragon of
theater, you have an agent you work with, you
audition, and if a director chooses to work with
you, you work,” she said. “If you make your
own work, you find your own space to work in.
If you wish to collaborate with people, you ask
those people to collaborate with you. You find
the money to produce, and you produce it. You
call the shots.”

Porter has advice for life and creativity. “My
life advice is to work hard and try to always
make a profit and to practice patience, courage,
generosity whenever possible,” she said. For
aspiring students who want to go into theater,
“I would say don’t ever let anybody tell you,
‘you can’t do this,’ and there are a thousand
ways to make a life in the theater, not all of
which are obvious.”

Dr. Ramer was the third person in his family to receive a double degree from Post in mathematics and chemistry. Ramer returned to Post in 2000 as an assistant professor in chemistry. In 2006, he was appointed the assistant dean for the college of liberal arts and sciences, and in 2009 he became associate dean. In this role, Dr. Ramer established the genetic counseling graduate program on campus. In 2015, he became the acting dean of the college. For his administrative work, he received the Green and Gold Staff Recognition Award in 2010. 
After stepping down from his administrative position and returning full-time to the chemistry department in 2016, Dr. Ramer continued teaching organic and biochemistry. Ramer’s research has focused on the structural and vibronic properties of ferroelectric materials, both inorganic and organic. 
Dr. Jennifer Snekser, assistant professor of biology, was also honored. “I have always loved science and animals since I was a young child,” she said. “I was fortunate to do behavioral research with killer whales when I was an undergraduate at Canisius College, and then I focused on fish social behavior when I earned my master’s at St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia and my PhD at Lehigh University.” 
Snekser finds the study of evolution and ecology vital to understanding the world. “Thinking about the history of life on this planet and the interconnectedness of all living things really puts our own individual lives into perspective,” she said. “Understanding evolution allows us to appreciate that beauty,” she said. 
Snekser is currently studying the social behavior of zebrafish and its relation to stress. “Zebrafish are social and associate with other zebrafish in groups called shoals,” she said. “They make choices on who they will associate with and one of the factors is group size: zebrafish generally like to hang out in bigger groups.” Snekser is measuring the stress hormone cortisol to see its impact on such decision making. “It turns out that zebrafish that are alone express higher levels of cortisol than zebrafish in groups. And males and females express different levels of cortisol.” Snekser identifies similar patterns in human males and females. “Understanding behavioral and physiological mechanisms in animals helps us to better understand them in humans.” 
“The best thing about teaching at Post is how much fun we have. I’ve been teaching introductory biology for many years and I always enjoy my interactions with students.” Snekser said. “Sure, we have a lot of complex concepts to understand, but we also do our best to enjoy the topics. I also really appreciate the support I have of all of my colleagues at LIU Post. I’m so lucky to work with a great group of scholars and educators.”

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced environmental initiatives for a greener New York on Earth Day, April 22, in the Tilles Center Atrium. Approximately 150 people attended the announcement, including Long Island officials, community members, and LIU Post students, staff and faculty; attendees were invited via email and had to rsvp for the event. They gathered in the Tilles Atrium to listen to the Governor, who spoke for approximately 15 minutes. 
“It was an incredible honor to welcome
Governor Cuomo to our campus on Earth Day
for an historic environmental announcement,”
University President Kimberly Cline, said.

Cline sat among other university staff and
students from the sociology and environmental
science degree programs. “As a University that
values experiential learning, I was very proud
to see our students join Governor Cuomo on
stage when he signed the historic ban on
plastic bags into law. I was inspired by
Governor Cuomo’s vision for a sustainable
future, and I’m sure our students were as well,”
she said.

Cuomo signed legislation passed by NYS
legislators banning the sale of single-use
plastic bags in New York, which will take
effect in March 2020. New York joins
California and Hawaii as the only states where
single-use plastic bags are banned. The ban,
according to Cuomo, will exempt “garment
bags, trash bags, and any bags used to wrap
or contain certain foods.” Counties and cities will have discretion to charge a five cent fee for single-use paper bags. The ban states that three cents from the fee will go to the NYS Environmental Protection Fund, which funds capital projects that protect the environment and enhance communities, and the other two cents go towards the locality to pay for distribution of reusable bags. 
Cuomo announced several other environmental conservation projects, including the “aggressive” goal for carbon-free electricity production by 2040; the progressive building of artificial (man made) reefs off of the NY Atlantic coast; and the revitalization of 47 NY parks and historical sites through the elimination of plastic bag pollution, with the $110 million allocated by NY legislators in the 2020 enacted budget. “That’s why New York State is not like any other state. New York by our history, by our legacy, we always led on the toughest problems first,” Cuomo said. 
Cuomo highlighted that the average American uses approximately 1,500 plastic bags a year, with New Yorkers using 23 billion alone. “Twelve million barrels of oil are used to make the plastic bags we use every year and by 2050 there will be more plastic by weight in the oceans than fish,” Cuomo said. The ban is a step towards reducing pollution and protecting fish and other wildlife. 
Alexandra Weismann, a senior political science major who attended the announcement, said she is guilty of using plastic bags. “I always reuse them for my garbage in my dorm or send them home for my mom to use for cat litter,” she said. “It’s definitely something I should be better about.” 
Weismann was excited to see Cuomo speak
on campus, and believes the ban is a move in
the right direction. “I hope we can continue to
make policy that shows we care about the
environment, especially on Long Island,” she
said.

Cuomo stressed New Yorkers must continue to be strong, saying that the federal government “wants to deny, wants to dispute, or out of convenience wants to ignore” climate change by burning more fossil fuels, proposing offshore drilling, and supporting industries that created these problems in the first place. “We’re going the exact opposite way,” he said about New York State’s proposed initiatives. “There’s no more important issue to lead on than the environment.” 
The Governor quoted a Native American
proverb: “We did not inherit the earth from
our parents. We are borrowing it from our
children.” With the ban of single-use plastic
bag, Cuomo hopes that New York State will
lead America in preserving the environment.

The co-valedictorians and salutatorian for the class of 2019 were notified on March 20 of their honors via email from Dean of Students Michael Berthel. This year there will be two valedictorians, Gianna Boscarino and Lauren Palumbo. The salutatorian will be Rebecca Kane. 
Gianna Boscarino, who finished her degree in psychology in December 2018, was shocked to find out that she is co-valedictorian. Since finishing her degree early, she assumed she was ineligible for the title. “It’s really a big honor and a privilege,” she said. 
“I have always prided myself on working hard at school and giving my all, almost to a fault, but this was something I certainly didn’t ever expect.” 
Boscarino balanced her
studies with a part-time job at
the Developmental Disabilities
Institute (DDI) as a teaching
assistant for their Center for
Autism beginning in her
sophomore year. But time-
management wasn’t always her
strong suit. The most challenging
thing for her was knowing how
and when to ask for help. “When
I first started school, I wasn’t
great at balancing at all. I was
getting really stressed out really
easily,” she said. But she learned
there is no shame in asking for
help, and utilized resources on
campus to get herself on the
right track.

Her proudest moment of her collegiate career was in her freshman spring semester, when she became a peer mentor. 
Boscarino and her fellow peer mentors organized a team building game event with the Autism Program at the Brookville Center for Children’s Services as part of the Post 101 service learning project. “Education, awareness and, most importantly, inclusion of individuals on the autism spectrum has always been something I have really become passionate about and I believe our project really helped get some of those messages across,” she said. 
Boscarino started a full-time position with DDI in January 2019, working as a teaching assistant in a preschool autism class in the mornings, and then in a middle school age autism classroom in the afternoons. “It’s been such an honor working there and getting to see the kids really succeed and believe in themselves when they’re backed up by the all the right kinds of support,” she said. She hopes to get a doctoral degree in school and community psychology, and to continue her work with children with autism. 
Lauren Palumbo, a digital arts & design
major, said being named co-valedictorian was
surreal. “I still need someone to pinch me,” she
said. Palumbo read the email minutes before
going into work and was overwhelmed with
emotions.”

Being named co-valedictorian was a surprise to Palumbo, who struggled with school most of her life. She has many people to thank for her success. “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for my amazing professors— Professor Conover, Professor O’Daly, Professor Aievoli, and Professor Del Rosso— and my amazing parents and friends that encourage me to work hard every day. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to
everyone that’s supported me and gotten me to
this point today,” she said.

Balancing school with two jobs, an internship with the marketing team at the Tilles Center, and being a member of the kickline team was a challenge for Palumbo. With a crazy schedule, she said that keeping herself busy helped her move along. “I think learning time management and making the most of your time between classes to get work done in the library is key,” she said. 
Some of Palumbo’s proudest moments at Post were her Graphic Design Senior Exhibition and when she received awards in Excellence in Digital Arts & Design and Academic Excellence. “Both are extremely proud moments and pushed me out of my comfort zone to publicly celebrate my work,” she said. 
“I am so grateful to be co-valedictorian and to represent my graduating class,” Palumbo said. “Congratulations to my co-valedictorian, Gianna Boscarino, and my friend, Rebecca Kane, salutatorian, as well as the whole Class of 2019.” Palumbo advises the underclassmen to “work hard and stay humble, because the possibilities for accomplishments in life are endless.” 
Palumbo is looking forward to some much-
needed relaxation and a trip with her best
friends after graduation. “I haven’t had the
opportunity to travel much, so I plan to travel
before promptly starting a full-time job,” she
said. Palumbo will be working as a designer in
New York City at an agency, a publisher, or any
other company that catches her interest.

Rebecca Kane, a digital arts & design major,
said she was both nervous and excited when
she found out she was salutatorian. “I did not
believe it at first, I had to keep rereading the
email,” Kane said. “I never imagined being one
of the top three.”

Kane credits her success in school to her skills in organization. Over time, she was able to manage school, a job, being a member of Alpha Xi Delta, working two internships at the GRO Agency and a small start up company, Impish Lee, and socializing with family and friends by prioritizing her time. “I had to step back and write everything down on my planner to get a sense of where I had the time, or if there were conflicts, which one took priority,” Kane said. 
Kane is most proud of her Graphic Design
Senior Exhibition. “Seeing all my hard work
over the past four years hung on the wall was
surreal and very exciting. It showed how far I’ve
come and how much I’ve grown as a designer,”
she said. Kane will also receive an award for
Excellence in Digital Arts & Design on May 1.

Of the many hurdles she’s faced throughout her college years, Kane says that now is the most challenging. “As I prepare for graduation and seeking a job, everything I have prepared for the past four years is finally here,” she said. She has much work to do, with finalizing her resume, portfolio and cover letters. “It is beginning to set in that my life as a student is complete in just a few short weeks.” 
Kane advises undergraduates following in
her footsteps that, “You do not have to be the
most outgoing person to be recognized, hard
work never goes unnoticed.”
