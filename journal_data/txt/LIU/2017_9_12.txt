This year at LIU Post students scurried into the dorm buildings to unload their things and set up their rooms. Students from every hall had arrived at LIU Post on September 5th to start moving in all of their belongings. Everything they needed from bedsheets to televisions, they unloaded all of it in their rooms for the remainder of the year. In every dorm, people were able to get help from other students called “Movers and shakers.” These students were all around campus with luggage and boxes hurrying up stairs and down hallways in order to help the other students move in free of charge.
It was easy to tell who was new and who was returning by how students unpacked their cars and by how they said goodbye to their parents.
My first interview was with the mother of Brianna, a freshman with an undecided major, who moved in Friday, Sept 1. “Brianna is my oldest child so this is the first time I’m experiencing this,” she said. “Dropping her off was harder than I thought, but I have faith that she’ll be ok and that she’s mature enough to handle living on her own.” She added that she is glad Brianna is only an hour drive away from her home in Southampton, so in case of an emergency, she can be on campus quickly. Marisa Vessenmeyer, a junior at LIU Post, living in Post hall, had gotten to the school around 11am so that she could be early to the party in moving in her things. “I was so excited to move in. I got my parents out of bed to help and we rushed here so I could move in early.” Her roommate shortly arrived after, Charlotte Fetonti, another junior who was eager to move in as well. “I love summer but coming back to school after a long break is always gets me motivated.” They both met freshman year and were roommates since the beginning. They set up their room pretty quickly and decided to help other people bring stuff into their dorm building.
Michael Licata, a junior on the LIU Post Lacrosse team, was a part of the “Movers and Shakers.” He had helped many people move in to Post Hall that day. He enjoyed it because it was a good way of meeting new people and he had already moved all of his stuff in on express move-in day a few days prior. “It’s always a fun time on campus when everyone comes back. This year, you could already tell there was a lot more people living in the halls and it never felt more alive.” Mr. Licata was very happy to be helping students move in, something he has volunteered for since freshman year.
Returning sophomore broadcasting major, Griffin Ward, found returning to be easier than moving in last year as a freshman. “Moving back in was easier than moving in freshman year. It was less stressful and I even missed being here. Coming in this time with friends and my brothers from my fraternity makes it all seem more like home, whereas last year I felt like a fish out of water,” he said.
Julia Sumakis, a sophomore nursing major, also moved in on Sept. 5. Sumakis commuted during her freshman year, making this is her first time residing on campus. The biggest change so far, she said, was not having her mom to go home to. She and her mom are best friends. Because her sister is also away at college this year, Sumakis feels like they are “leaving their mom behind.” Having a roommate is also a change for her. “I’m honestly freaked out about having a roommate because I don’t know her that well. I haven’t shared a room with anyone since I was about nine and I really appreciated having a room to myself. I also feel like it will be a good chance to bond with someone new though, and share memories with. I think overall it’ll be fun,” she said.
As all the students had moved in, the day finally came to an end. Students were ready for beds that they had just made and were ready to start classes in the morning. It was a quiet time on campus that night as everyone had been eager to finally start school so they slept soundly in their dorms until the morning.

Ever dreamed of a career as a veterinary technician? In a year or three, you might be in luck, as the LIU Post administration has submitted plans to the NY State Department of Education for a veterinary technician program.
A vet technician is the assistant or “nurse” to the veterinarian. Vet techs assist the veterinarian in surgery, administer medications or anesthesia, take x-rays, perform dental and laboratory procedures, keep records, restrain animals, and participate in client education and practice management, according to VeterinarianEDU.org. There are currently 10 veterinary technician programs in NY, and each program has a heavily science-based core curriculum. Students will have to be well-rounded in liberal arts and sciences before beginning the program.
At the university gala at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan on June 15, LIU President Kimberly Cline announced to the hundreds of guests, including alumni and university trustees and administrators, that she had signed off an application for the vet tech program just days prior.
Karin Melkonian, chair of the pre-medical sciences advisement committee, confirmed that an application for the vet tech program had been submitted to the state, yet could not offer any further information. Stacy Gropack, dean of the school of health professions and nursing, stated that they are still awaiting “official approval” from the state, and could not officially publicize the program. Robin Sturtz, program director of veterinary technology according to animal facilities director Christopher McAllister, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries.
It has not been confirmed whether the program will be placed in the school of health professions and nursing. A sign placed outside of an office in the Winnick Mansion read, “Office of the Dean, LIU School of Veterinary Medicine,” though
Gropack clarified that the university proposed a program, rather than a school. No other information was given.
The Pioneer submitted a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request to the state during the summer and is awaiting a response. All records led with the state Department of Education are available upon request to the public for inspection, pursuant to the state FOIL law.

The start of the fall semester brings changes in administration. Nathaniel Bowditch has been appointed Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Steven Breese has been appointed Dean of the College of Arts, Communications and Design, both effective July 1.
Breese was the academic dean of the school of arts and sciences at Southern Connecticut State University in Hamden, CT for almost five years. The school of arts and sciences at the SCSU covered everything from the sciences, social sciences, all the way to the fine arts, making up nearly half of the student body. Breese oversaw about 250 full time faculty and 350 adjunct professors.
“When I decided I wanted to focus more on the arts again, which is where my background is, I looked at a couple of institutions, and Post was one of them and I’m glad to come here,” Breese said. “While it’s a very different experience, it’s really been enjoyable so far,” he added.
The biggest difference for Breese will be his ability to focus more on the arts; in his last position, he spent much of his time spread out among the different majors. Breese is looking forward to being involved in the college, and getting to know the students and faculty.
Breese spent much of his early career involved in theatre. He was an actor, director and playwright before becoming involved in education. “Really what brought me here is the fact that I can focus on communications and the arts. That’s where my passion and greatest knowledge is, and where my real interest is. Helping students become better at this work that I love so dearly,” Breese said.
Breese hopes that he will be able to help grow the college, add additional programs to help students, and invite more students and faculty. Aside from his academic responsibilities as dean, Breese enjoys riding his skateboard on campus. “You will see me skateboarding around campus, even in my suit and tie,” he laughed. He also enjoys sailing, bicycling, and hopes to continue his directing and acting career in the theatre while he is dean.
Breese replaces Noel Zahler, who left the university in August 2016 after four years as the CACD Dean. Christine Kerr, a professor in the art department and the director of the art therapy program, was the interim CACD dean during the 2016-2017 academic year.
Nathaniel Bowditch was the dean of the school of humanities and social sciences at American University in Cario, Egypt for seven years before joining LIU Post. He was also an associate professor who taught philosophy classes.
If you look out the large window in Bowditch’s office in the mansion, you’ll see the beautiful nature of the campus with lush green grass, tall trees covered in leaves and bright green bushes, the opposite of the dry, desert environment at American University in Egypt. “The biggest difference is being home and being in such a beautiful place after being away for so long,” Bowditch said. “It’s been 11 years since I’ve been living in my own country,” he added.
During his time living in Egypt, Bowditch experienced a lot of serious political and economic crises in the country. He was living in Egypt during the Jan. 25, 2011 revolution, when mass demonstrations against poverty, corruption and political repression broke out. The uprising forced one of the region’s longest serving leaders, President Hosni Mubarak, from power.
Bowditch found his love for the liberal arts and sciences after attending night school. “I found that I loved the things that really excited me, and I found the more I did it the more I loved it,” Bowditch said. “Why liberal arts? Because that’s who I am and it’s where I’m from and it’s a world I value,” he added. Bowditch plans to listen and learn before making major changes to the college. “In the immediate, what I really want students to see is an openness and energy in my office, where students can come see me if they need something,” he said. “At the end of the day, the job of the dean is exciting and fun, but for me it’s about serving the university. I’m here to make it work to take our strengths and expand on them, to fix what isn’t working, and that I’m here to work for the students,” he added. Bowditch also plans to begin teaching philosophy classes in the spring semester.
Bowditch has a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy from the University of California at Berkeley and a Master’s and PhD in Philosophy from Johns Hopkins University.
The former dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Katherine Hill-Miller, stepped down in 2015 after 13 years and returned to her position as a professor in the English Department. Chemistry Professor, Nicholas Ramer, who had been the associate dean, was the acting dean from 2015 to 2016. When Ramer stepped down from the position in 2016, LIU Global Dean Jeffrey Belnap was appointed acting dean while the university searched for a permanent replacement.

Moa Golster, a 2016 journalism graduate and former online editor of the Pioneer, won a first place award in the student narrative feature category at the 2017 Press Club of Long Island Media Awards dinner. The award, presented on June 7 at the Woodbury Country Club in Oyster Bay was for Golster’s article “Billy Joel Gives Back,”  published by the Pioneer on February 10, 2016.
The Press Club of Long Island is one of the largest professional chapters of the Society of Professional Journalists. The annual PCLI awards honor professional and student journalists from across Long Island. LIU Post was one of the few universities recognized at the event. “It is such an honor for the press club to present awards to the top journalists on Long island each year,” PCLI President Chris R. Vaccaro said.
“I am very honored. This came unexpectedly since I have had time to graduate, move back to my native Sweden and start working,” Golster said. “It is a wonderful reminder of the many things I learned from my professors back at LIU Post – three years that obviously paid off. It’s also a nice reminder of a day that I will always remember, the day I got to interview Billy Joel!” she added.
Golster interviewed Joel when he visited the Tilles Center in Feb. 2016. Joel pledged $1 million from his foundation to the Long Island High School for the Arts.
Currently Golster, is working for a morning show in Sweden called Aftonbladet Morgon. Golster is in charge of putting together scripts, she also researches the guests and books everyone from politicians, experts and celebrities to appear on the show.
The Pioneer has won PCLI awards for several consecutive years. Last year, the Pioneer won in the Best College Newspaper, Narrative News Story/Student, Narrative Feature Story/Student, and Narrative Sports Story/Student categories. “From our hall of fame inductions to giving out prestigious awards to deserving professionals and students, this is the highlight of our year, and we congratulate all the winners. We hope that the awards competition helps to make the journalism on Long Island even stronger,” PCLI President Vaccaro said.
Earlier this spring, the Pioneer won two Region 1 Mark of Excellence Awards from the Society of Professional Journalists. Maxime Devillaz was a finalist in the Breaking News category and Harry Pearse was a finalist in the General Column Writing category.

While Director of the Honors College Joan Digby goes on sabbatical in the fall semester, Nicholas Ramer, associate professor of chemistry, who once was an honors student at C.W. Post himself, will take over as acting director of the Honors College.
Digby, who has been teaching at Post since 1969, will take one semester off. “I can’t really afford to be gone for a year,” she said. She will return in the spring to recruit a new freshman honors class.
For the last 10 to 12 years, Digby has worked with her husband printing and publishing poetry on their private press, New Feral Press. “A small press, sometimes also called a private press, is a publishing business that only makes books limited in the number of pages and the print run,” Digby explained. “We make only 100 copies of every book we print, and they can be from 6 pages to about 100 pages…Small presses are often not-for-profit, while big presses are certainly for profit companies.”
They’ve published many books of poetry, and Digby has taken an interest in how small presses have moved from letterpress printing to digital printing. “A printing press is the mechanical object that makes the books; hand presses called ‘letter presses’ require the type to be set letter by letter. There are still some of those. Then there are “off set presses,” which are most of the commercial presses. We simply use our computer to make digitally produced books,” Digby said about the printing process.
Her sabbatical project will be to study this change and the impact it has had on small presses that do limited editions.
Digby will do most of her research at Poets House, a poetry library in Manhattan. She will also interview owners of small presses. She does not have any plans to travel. Her research will either become articles, a monograph or a book. According to Digby, with sabbatical projects, research must be published and available to others, usually through an academic journal.
For Digby, having time to herself during the sabbatical also means she can write, photograph and publish. She will also spend time thinking about possible changes to the Honors College. A sabbatical “gives you time to rest but to recharge,” she said.
Due to a large incoming freshman class of Honors students, Digby has had to nd new ways to accommodate the class size this fall, including more courses and networking with different professors and departments so students in different majors can get a more challenging experience through Honors. This freshman class of 123 students will be the largest group of honors students in the last seven to eight years, Ramer said. Digby is not worried about her absence from the Honors College this semester. “Tracy [Christy] and I have been a team for 20 years,” she said. “Tracy can be helpful to any student who has a question. Leaving Tracy and Nick Ramer in charge of Honors [College] puts me completely at rest,” she added. Digby also lives 10 minutes away from campus and will be on campus every day to feed the cats residing on campus, which she has done for many years. If students want to meet with her, she is open to talking while she feeds the cats or walks her horse, which she keeps in the stables on campus.
This is not Ramer’s first time taking over the Honors College. He filled in for Digby during the spring semester of 2002, when she took a previous sabbatical. Ramer has a special tie with the college as he was an Honors student himself, graduating in 1994.
Ramer has been a professor in the chemistry department since 2000. He has also been assistant dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences from 2006 to 2009, the associate dean from 2009 to 2015 and the acting dean in 2016.
Compared to his other administrative roles, Ramer believes working in the Honors College gives him the opportunity to become more directly involved with students. “I like that kind of direct connection to the students without the layers. When you’re dean, there are layers beneath you and you don’t really get to see the outcome of your decisions,” he said.
Although Ramer will not teach an honors course this semester, he has taught honors courses before. From 2002 to 2004, he taught a chemistry honors course. In the fall, Ramer will continue to teach Basic Organic Chemistry, a course for nutrition majors.
Ramer is grateful to be on the other side of the desk and see students using the Honors College as a springboard for what they want to do. “I am coming in to keep everything together,” he said. “I am not changing anything or making any major decisions. Dr. Digby has it well underhand and she does not need me to do anything. The program runs perfectly well as it is. All I’m going to do is make sure it stays on track and basically don’t break it. If it’s not broken don’t fix it, right?”

Students returning to campus treaded on new pavement this fall semester after the facilities services crew worked over the summer to improve the campus. Roads were paved on University Drive, Post Lane and Pioneer Blvd. On the south side of Humanities, the walkway and stairs were replaced, and a new irrigation sprinkler system was installed on the eastern side of the Great Lawn between Winnick House and Humanities. In addition, the old carpeting was removed from the walls in the Hillwood Commons lobby and the walls were painted green, according to Roy Fergus, new director of facilities services. Fergus, who previously worked as an Aramark consultant, took over as head of facilities services for the Post and Brooklyn campuses in July, replacing Bill Kirker, who retired after 22 years.
The largest renovation project which is still underway is the “Museum Project,” which will be located in the library. The portico area of the Hudson Gallery in the basement level of the library is being retrofitted to become a part of the new Steinberg Art Museum. This renovation will ensure the entire area has a much larger viewing space than the previous location on the second floor of Hillwood Commons. This task has proven to be the most complicated. “Because the stacks area next to the library is included a couple of floors down, it’ll be like a fishbowl: a glass enclosed area with a walkway around it. In the stacks area, you’ll be able to look in, and there will also be storage areas for artwork,” Fergus said.
Facilities services have also been working on the campus-wide addition of 30 smart boards to classrooms. This will contribute to meeting their strategic goals for improving academic spaces. Smartboards have been installed in Lorber Hall, Pell Hall and the library so far, and seven more boards remain to be installed.
“The plan is that all projects will be essentially completed for the start of the fall semester,” Fergus disclosed the week before classes began. Weekly meetings with Conference Services and Residential Life have ensured that construction continued with no hindrances. “There are weather issues and delivery issues, but all within the plan, we’re able to execute the projects,” Fergus said.
Once the summer projects are completed, Fergus and his team are already preparing for their next summer project. “We’re doing lots of planning, lots of expert purchasing of services,” Fergus said. “That’s all being done in the fall for next summer’s preparation activities.”

What does it take to be awarded journalism’s highest award? Thomas Peele, a 1987 C.W. Post alumnus and investigative reporter for the Bay Area News Group in California, did just that in April 2017, when he was a part of a team at the East Bay Times that won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for a series of breaking news stories about the deadly “Ghost Ship” warehouse party fire that killed 36 in Oakland, CA last December.
The award to the staff of the East Bay Times was “for relentless coverage of the ‘Ghost Ship’ fire, which killed 36 people at a warehouse party, and for reporting after the tragedy that exposed the city’s failure to take actions that might have prevented it,” according to the judges. The Breaking News Reporting prize honors a distinguished example of local reporting of breaking news that, as quickly as possible, captures events accurately as they occur, and, as time passes, illuminates, provides context and expands upon the initial coverage. The prize carries with it an award of $15,000.
When it comes to breaking news stories, it is all hands on deck. Peele, who focuses on government accountability, public records and data, and transparency laws in his work, immediately dug into the who, what, when, where and why of the tragic incident in December. “I wanted to see documents that describe why and how something happened,” Peele said in a phone interview from California, where he has been working since 2000.
On the ride to the scene, Peele recounted the radio describing the warehouse as an “illegal night club,” raising several questions: what was the building and what was allowed to happen in the warehouse? Why were parties being held there? “It turned out to be an art collective with people living in it and renting it out as an event space with no permits,” Peele said. With this activity in warehouse going on for years, Peele researched why the city didn’t take regulatory actions or do more to shut it down. “Essentially, it was a fire trap, and that’s enough right there to keep the story going for a long time,” he added.
Peele’s coverage of the story has continued, from the breaking news coverage in December to most recently, August 7, when Peele covered the calls for a memorial to be made of the warehouse space. Peele and his team have been dedicated to this narrative for nine months. “It’s pretty much all we’ve done since. We haven’t gotten to the bottom of it” he said.
Peele discovered many faults on part of the police. “Police and remen had been there many times,” he said. Whether they were visiting a party or responding to a small dispute, there were no reports or records of it being an “illegal dwelling,” according to his research.
Peele was commended for his “relentless” coverage. It is difficult work for the most part, dealing with adversary relationships to government of officials and positions of power every day. “It was the same at Post,” he said about his time as both Sports Editor and Managing Editor for The Pioneer and his relationship with the administration then. “No one would talk,” he recalled.
This Pulitzer prize winning reporter and LIU alumnus gave advice to current Pioneer staff: “Be as independent as possible and continue with aggressive reporting on the administration.”

The campus was recently the set for NBC’s “The Blacklist” starring James Spader and Megan Boone. Filming took place at the Sculpture Studio and the Equestrian Center. The location was chosen by scouts because it looks like an Irish countryside, which is where the episode takes place.
According to an e-mail sent to students by Rita Langdon, director of undergraduate and graduate admissions, “For those new to LIU Post – our campus is a sought-after location for major motion pictures and TV shows. We have filmed episodes of Madam Secretary, the Blindspot, The Following, Royal Pains, and The Rewrite with Hugh Grant and Marisa Tomei.
”Students had the opportunity to be cast as extras in the show. Jessica Sulkers, Ava Greenbaum, Monica Moscoso, and Katie Galvin, members of the equestrian team participated as extras in the season 5 episode 4 of the Blacklist, which is set to air in early November.
“I was astounded as to how much effort and teamwork goes into producing a TV show. It was an amazing opportunity, and good exposure to a field I’ve never been around at all,” said sophomore, equestrian team member, Katie Galvin said.
“We had to hold and walk horses in the background of the shot they were filming. It was exciting to see how much work went into filming only 5 minutes of the show. They built a false front on the barn which they later lit on fire which was cool to see too,” said Jessica Sulkers a junior, member of the equestrian team.

The Summer Honors Institutes, a week-long academic program for rising high school seniors, ran from July 9-14. There were 13 different institutes offered by the School of Health Professions and Nursing, and the colleges of Management, Arts, Communications and Design and Liberal Arts and Sciences. “The wonderful brainchild of President Cline is an initiative to bring the best and most talented students to LIU Post in order to introduce them to the stellar programs we have here,” Cara Gargano, chairperson of the Department of Theater, Dance & Arts Management, said. There were 386 attendees this year combined from all of the various programs, including dance, musical theatre, digital game design and creative writing. The high school participants were recommended by their schools to participate in the Institutes on full scholarships.
The Institutes brought many students to campus to participate in programs of their interest. Gargano described the intensive performance-based programs. “We started every day with company warm-ups and then go into classes and rehearsals with breaks for lunch and dinner.” Theater and dance faculty members were on campus for the entire week, she said. “The faculty and staff are here 24/7 holding rehearsals and classes, teaching music and choreography, staging all the numbers, making costumes, hanging and focusing the lights, and preparing the sound.” Auditions for both the musical theatre and dance programs took place across 14 states, and video applications were also submitted. “In the five years we have been doing this program, many of these folks have been invited to apply to our department. It is a pleasure to work with all of them!” Gargano said.
“This year the theme of the creative writing Summer Honors Institute was ‘Writing Outside the Lines,’” Dr. Joan Digby,  professor of English, said. The overall goal of this program was to broaden participants’ concept of creativity. Dr. John Lutz,  English chairperson, added, “Students are very enthusiastic, it’s an opportunity for students who are interested in expressing themselves to learn how to do so in different kinds of writing styles and forms.” Digby led a field trip into New York City, during which students visited many areas of the city, rode on the Second Avenue subway (wherein art has been incorporated into passengers’ commute) and took photos of subjects such as high-rise buildings to evoke creative writing. Digby’s trip emphasized how “New York, a city based on a grid plan, encourages pushing and curving the lines as a creative, ever-expanding city,” she said. Everything we experienced added to the concept of writing “outside the lines,” Digby said. Lutz ran a component about nature writing. “I think the Institute itself is a really good experience for students and people teaching it,” he said.
A digital game design institute was also offered.  “Students split their time between learning fundamentals of game design and how to use the industry standard game engine Unity3D,” Andrew Wallace, assistant professor of digital game design, said. By then end of the institute, the 21 participants flexed their design muscles on both a board game and a digital, first person game, Wallace said.
Amy Freedman, chairperson of the political science department, ran an institute called, “Model UN – A Foreign Affair.” The class consisted of classroom lecture and discussion, a UN Security Council simulation done online and field trips into the city,” Freedman said. The 29 participating students visited the United Nations Visitor Centre and the Museum of Natural History. “One of the areas we focused our discussions on during the week was on international environmental agreements,” she said. This summer was Freedman’s first summer teaching a Summer Honors Institute. “It worked out well; the students were very bright, very motivated and all came ready to have fun and learn a lot,” she said.

The common read selection for the 2017- 2018 freshman class is Look Me In The Eye: My Life With Asperger’s, by John Elder Robison. The common read, a required reading for the incoming class, has been implemented by the university for seven years.
The responsibility of choosing the common read for each year is given to the Post Peer Mentors, students who co-teach the Post Foundations course. From the Peer Mentors’ selections, the novels are then passed on to the Book Committee, composed of students and professors. Kathleen Kumpas, a peer mentor, was one of two students involved with deciding on this year’s book selection. “The committee had selected from five books, including the selected book, which were previously common reads at other universities,” Kumpas said.
This semester, students will discuss and be quizzed on the novel in the Post Foundations class. The common read is a way for all freshmen to relate to each other. “The importance of the common read is that it connects students to the campus, whether it be a discussion with a fellow student or to the Post Foundations class,” Kumpas said.
English Department Chair Dr. John Lutz, who teaches a section of Post 101, has been involved in the Peer Mentor Program and the Book Committee. He made suggestions from the list compiled by the peer mentors and gathered suggestions from members of the campus community. “I think that it’s very important for new students to have common experiences that connect them to the campus community,” Lutz said.
Alexandra Uribe, a freshman psychology major, felt that the book was a forced reading requirement at first. “After reading through the pages, I began to really enjoy the reading because the book was written about the author’s personal experiences. I feel a reader can connect more to an author when they are discussing themselves and their stages of life,” Uribe said.
After completing the book, Uribe’s view of a common read changed. “It’s important to have a common read because you can listen to other people’s comments and opinions about the book. I believe we need to hear more about other individuals’ personal stories, so we can learn more about that person and understand them on a whole new level,” Uribe said.
Freshmen who have yet to pick up the common read can visit the LIU Promise office on the second floor of Hillwood Commons to receive a copy of Look Me In The Eye: My Life With Asperger’s. Students interested in participating in the choosing of next year’s common read can contact Dr. Lutz to become a peer mentor.

Meet Cocoa, the pet dog of Nick Tangorra, a junior public relations major. Cocoa is a seven year old shitzu. He was named Cocoa because when his owners bought him he was dark drown, but as he’s aged, his fur is turning white. Cocoa is extremely territorial and loves his family and home. “He hates plates and bowls, so he will only eat off of napkins or paper towels. He also loves eating napkins or paper towels,” Tangorra said. Cocoa hates thunder and fireworks, but loves to watch reality television, especially Shahs of Sunset. Cocoa and his owners love to cuddle, watch movies, go for walks, and eat chinese food, being that it is his favorite.

As summer comes to an end, students begin reminiscing on their summer memories and start thinking of the ones they’ll make in 2018. Some students spent their summer working, others relaxing at home, and those who were fortunate enough spent their summer abroad. Whether in Europe, Asia, or the Americas, a summer abroad brings endless memories and experiences that you will never forget.
Irene Spanos, a senior elementary education major spent her entire summer on the little island of Xios, Greece. Spanos has a lot of family in Greece and enjoys going back to spend time with them. “It is like my second home, she said. Whether at the beach or at dinner with her family, Spanos takes in every detail her island has to offer. “There is no better feeling than being in my favorite place with the people I love the most, Spanos said.
Victoria Boccella, a junior public relations major spent some of her summer eating her way through Italy. “I got to try some amazing foods, burrata con prosciutto was definitely a favorite antipasto of mine,” she said. Boccella and her family come from a city in southern Italy called Naples. Boccella loves traveling and can’t wait to do it again. “Vacationing abroad was beyond amazing and is something I look forward to doing again,” she said.
Like Boccella, Gianna Maccarino, a sophomore also went to Italy over the summer. Maccarino’s family went to Italy for 10 days as a birthday present to her. Maccarino’s favorite part of Italy was Venice. “It was always a dream of mine to go to Venice and tour the beautiful city in a gondola, little did I know the guy would let me steer it,” Maccarino said. This moment will stay with her forever.
Even though summer is over, students will always remember their wonderful trips abroad and can start thinking of the next place they’ll go in summer 2018.

There are so many horror movies released each year, especially before Halloween. Many of them are predictable, unoriginal or just too cliché to sit through. However, with “It,” released on September 8, director Andy Muschietti was able to capture a cinematic masterpiece that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats for over two hours. The actors do an amazing job of discarding their millennial mind set and embodying pubescent tweens in 1989. The movie starts off with Georgie Denbrough (Jackson Robert Scott) and his older brother Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) building him a paper boat to sail along the flooded road. Unfortunately, the paper boat ends up in the hands of Pennywise(Bill Skarsgárd), an ominous figure has two bright eyes peaking out of a storm drain. Pennywise lures young Georgie into the drain and kills him, and this is where the movie sets sail. 
Muschietti makes sure every minute piece of the set reflects life in the late 1980’s, from the clothing the kids wore to the sign on the local movie theater that played Tim Burton’s Batman Skarsgärd does an astonishing job in recreating the fear Tim Curry’s portrayal of the role Pennywise in the 1990 miniseries gave audiences.
The only gripe I have with the movie is that Muschietti seems to have stuffed all of the frig
htening aspects of the film into the beginning to the point where later on in the movie, Pennywise was just “that evil clown.” I wish Muschietti had kept him lurking in the shadows in the beginning; it would have built up the anticipation of finally seeing the clown when he is most needed to really deliver the jump scare. The movie is still fantastic and has moments that will get viewer’s hearts racing.
“It” is one of the rare horror movies that leaves watchers frightened and makes them want to be scared further due to Skarsgärd’s performance and the diversity of personality in the characters. If you haven’t seen “It” yet, get your tickets.

This fall, the department of theatre, dance & arts management welcomed its largest freshman class of theater majors in history. 58 students comprise the newest addition to the Post Theatre Company. Department chairperson Cara Gargano, explained that the increase is partially due to the faculty making the effort towards attending more national audition opportunities. Admissions and the office of the president provided generous financial support to the department this year.
Erica Henning, a freshman musical theatre major from Sandusky, OH, was drawn to Post because of the rigorous theatre program, and the school’s close proximity to Broadway. “I think it’s going to be really intense but really worth it,” she said. Henning anticipates improving her skills as a dancer, actor and person from the program’s training. She is excited to learn from the staff and the upperclassmen. “Everyone seems really nice and welcoming,” she said. Henning looks forward to seeing Post Theatre Company’s (PTC) main stage productions and participating in the E.S.T.A (Emerging Student Theatre Artist) season. The latter consists of student-written, produced and directed works.
“I’ve been acting since I was nine and telling stories since I was born,” Henning said. She has always possessed a love for fiction and promoted the importance of telling stories to change things in the world around her. “[Acting] is my way of escaping everyday life, but at the same time it’s also me making a comment on that,” Henning said. She had not decided to major in theatre until two years ago. “I always wanted to major in creative writing,” she said, thanks largely to her parents’ influence. Having participates in summer acting intensives in New York before, Henning is adapting well and is ex- cited to be so far from her home for college.
Freshman theatre major Emma Kocar, has also traveled a long distance, from Aurora, OH, to attend LIU Post. “I like how well-rounded [the program] is,” Kocar said. The acting major requires directing and play writing components in addition to acting, dance and vocal training. “In a lot of places, they tend to separate the acting and musical theatre aspects,” she said. Kocar found acting by chance after participating in the Academy of Performing Arts hosted by Chagrin Falls High School in Chagrin Falls, OH. She is very excited to learn from the staff . “It’s great how quickly we all became what everyone likes to describe as a family; I already feel like I have a lot of friends.”
“From the moment we took that first class and discussed Stanislavski, creating images in your head and embodying the character,” Kocar said, “it threw every single stereotype I had of acting out the window.”
To accommodate the influx of new students, Gargano said that the theatre arts department has added more part-time faculty. “We have not added additional full time staff yet, but as the need develops, I am sure the university will support this growth!”
