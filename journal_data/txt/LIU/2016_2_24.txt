I recently registered to vote through the Rock the Vote website, an organization whose main goal is to get more young people involved with politics. To be honest, my reasons for not registering as soon as I turned 18 were largely because I was lazy and forgot to do so. It had little to do with my lack of interest in politics. However, as I started to question what candidate I will give my vote to, I realized that it was time for me to stop being lazy and register.
Because, if I had not registered then what was the point of even thinking about the election’s possible outcome if I myself wasn’t even registered to vote yet?
Thinking about issues that will affect you and who will fix those issues all leads back to the most essential fact: you simply have to vote for there to be progress. I wouldn’t consider myself to be someone who is interested in politics, but ironically I have always been passionate about social issues, and those two do come hand in hand. Whether it’s immigration or health care policies, everyone has an opinion. Unfortunately, we are not all equipped to run for president, so we seek for the candidate who represents our best interests.
As a millennial, I believe that our generation is extremely socially conscious, whether it is by expressing their opinions on social media or by simply having an awareness of the current issues. However, contrary to my perception of my generation, according to a report done by The Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), last year was the lowest youth turnout rate ever recorded in a federal election, with only 19.9 percent of 18 to 19-year-olds voting.
As a young adult, sometimes we feel as if our vote doesn’t count or one vote won’t tip the scale one way or another. I feel otherwise; the youth votes are the ones that count the most. Young voters are the voice of the future. The votes that are cast by young voters will directly impact their lives in the future. How could their vote count any less when they are the ones who are voting for their future?
Senior broadcasting major, Jacqueline Niciforo, plans on voting in the November presidential election. “I think it’s important for college students and recent graduates to be interested in voting,” she said. “It’s not really about being interested in politics only, rather to be interested in your own future.”
Remember that the economic policies that politicians make directly affect young citizens. According to Debt.org, 70 percent of college students leave school with student loans that average $33,000, and they are having a hard time finding jobs. This statistic alone should keep millennials interested in what candidates have to offer and propel them towards the voting booths.
We live in the United States of America, a country that is a democracy, where we are told that our voice and opinions matter. Yet we still take our right to pave the future of our country for granted.
Fortunately, as the primaries begin for the 2016 election, there has been a rise in young voters. During an interview with NPR, the director of CIRCLE claimed that in the Iowa caucuses the youth turnout was the second-highest in the last 20 years, at 11.2 percent. I believe a big part of the youth turnout has to do with Bernie Sanders, a candidate who expresses interest in the concerns that the youth of America face. This hypothesis was supported at the New Hampshire primary where 83% of Sanders’ votes were from 18 to 29-year-olds. These results give us hope that as we continue with the primaries and then the general election in the fall, there will be a much higher turnout for youth voters.
Personally, I think it’s great to have someone like Sanders representing the youth; he is someone who is not afraid to move forward. There are candidates running who we may think are a complete joke, making a mockery of our presidential election. However, that does not mean that the youth should not be motivated to vote in this election. Quite the contrary.
Remember that you are not just voting for a person but rather for what that person stands for. If there are no young voters, then there will be no one voting for their future interests. If you are over 18 and are yet not registered to vote, I hope this article has persuaded you to go out there and do so. Registering is so easy, you can do it online, in person or by mail and all you have to do is fill out a single form. For more information, visit dmv.org or rockthevote.com.

At a glance, politics during the current election cycle appears to be a clash of extremes. The field has been flooded with outsiders fighting against insiders cozy with their party establishment. A billionaire businessman-turned-reality-star surges in the polls. A retired, sleepy-eyed black neurosurgeon talks about grain in the pyramids. Two Latino right wingers contest who is tougher on immigration. A first-lady-turned-senator-turned-secretary-of-state takes her second, expected bid for the White House. A self-described democratic socialist Jew wins a New Hampshire primary by 21 percent — the first non-christian to ever do so.
One may wonder how the selection process would work, sorting among these views when the decision comes at the ballot. Moreover, why would someone want a reality star? Why a man who calls himself a socialist?
The last two are, as you may have gathered, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders — two populists who have strong messages of fundamental change in politics. In full disclosure, let it be known that this writer is a supporter of Sanders. However, I do not wish to discuss my support, but instead the reasons and similarities of reasoning involved in why people would support one of these two candidates; these two who have shaken up the election in a way that may determine the future of both the DNC and GOP.
Trump “speaks the mind of the people” and “is the businessman we need” as any random supporter may say. The main argument, from what I have observed, is that his outsider perspective, tough charisma and business savvy is a way to revitalize our politics. He is not beholden to big money donors – he’s already rich! He’s tough on Mexico – they’ll build a wall on the border! He’s tough on terrorism – he’ll put a ban on all Muslims coming into the country until we figure out what is going on!
While these talking points may seem wacky, it’s important to consider where we are at in politics, particularly with the GOP. Voters seem to be fed up with establishment politics — Democrats and Republicans — and when it comes down to choosing someone like Marco Rubio, who was lambasted for nervously repeating the same canned talking point during a recent debate, or someone like Trump who speaks their mind and is outwardly humorous (just as many people laugh with him than at him) it is not hard to see the appeal.
More, it may be argued that Trump truly appeals to voters who glorify President Ronald Reagan — a man who was also a charismatic entertainer. Trump has the ability to rile up emotions and a peek at one of his rallies, almost always on TV drawing through-the-roof ratings, is clear proof of evidence.
Sanders speaks up from the left in a similar fashion against establishment politics and economics. He, too, does not take money from large interest groups, other than some unions. His vivacious grassroots and social media campaign has pulled in a continual stream of donations, out-raising his democratic competitor Hillary Clinton in January. A long-running independent mayor, congressman and then senator, Sanders’ politics align with European Social Democracy, proposing changes to our system, like Universal Single Payer Healthcare, which have been a staple in most other top world powers for years.
Some argue that Sanders’ FDR-like proposals are too big, expensive and liberal to pass through our Republican-held congress. However, Sanders and his campaign have been churning up many thousands to his rallies, with record new and youth voters throwing him their support — the plan being to gather a populist movement to elect new democratic presidency. High voter turnout primary and caucusing states that have already cast their vote demonstrate that this notion is not as much of a pipe dream as it may have seemed but a few months ago.
While both Sanders and Trump were skeptical contenders several months ago, there is more than solid proof that they are in it for the long haul. The latter has been firmly set as the GOP polling frontrunner for the majority of the race and while he did come second to Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucus last month, his win in New Hampshire shows he is not a toothless carnival barker.
The republican establishment, who have largely denounced Trump up until recent endorsements by figures like Sarah Palin, appear to have a choice to make: fall in line behind Trump or pile all endorsements and support behind a candidate like Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz or even John Kasich, who has received endorsement from the New York Times and came second to Trump in the New Hampshire primary.
The clock is ticking, furiously, as the Nevada caucus has crept by, Trump winning by over 20 points, South Carolina is less than a week away, and the cavalcade of states voting on Super Tuesday next month will be the turning point for many campaigns. If Trump’s commanding national lead holds (up 20 points over Rubio, in second, according to 538’s Feb 18 aggregate) his competition will be hard pressed to keep up if he does not lose his significant lead by the time March rolls around.
The same pressure applies to Sanders’ campaign, albeit from the point of surging underdog. The close results in Nevada, where Sanders trailed by 5 percent, have demonstrated that Sanders has the capacity to make an impact in states that are more ethnically and racially diverse than New Hampshire, where he won the primary last month, and states like Massachusetts and his home of Vermont, where he leads Clinton by even larger margins. One of the most significant roadblocks for Sanders is overcoming his lack of name recognition, particularly with African Americans in southern states. The Sanders campaign has made progress, drawing support from several black activists and politicians, including Cornell West, rapper Killer Mike, filmmaker Spike Lee and former NAACP Chair Ben Jealous.
Still, polls have been trending upwards all around for Sanders, Fox News’ Feb. 15-17 poll showing a 47-44 Sanders national lead, where Ipsos/ Reuters Feb.13-17 showing Clinton up 45-42. Polls are not always accurate, as the extremely close 50-50 tie in the Iowa Caucus surprised many. It is important to consider that Sanders has only made up ground the entire race thus far, closing gaps and rising over up to 50 percent.
After the results in Nevada, we may very well see even more of a boost for Sanders going into South Carolina, where Clinton still holds a lead of at least 10 points and as high as 30 according to some polls. The fact that Sanders has been able to perform in a dead heat with Clinton demonstrates that this race is far from over. If he comes within ten points in South Carolina, I anticipate more momentum and a long slugfest going into Super Tuesday and beyond. Regardless of the results on the democratic and republican camps, Sanders and Trump have pushed the political conversation in wild, refreshing directions that could have major implications for the future of the country.

Each year, I keep a list of the films I’ve seen and those that I want to see. It’s usually massive — 2015 still has 97 left to see, with 27 on my ‘seen list.’ This pales in comparison to the year before, where I was somehow able to pull off a binge of over 50 films released theatrically. These last few weeks I’ve been furiously trying to get through essentials on the list, prepping for the Academy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 28. While “The Revenant” and “The Big Short” are of course hot shot award contenders, among others, I would like to note a few films released in 2015 that may have fallen off the radar and perhaps deserve a bit more attention.
“Steve Jobs” has drawn a best actor nomination for Michael Fassbender’s work
in the titular role. While the film itself didn’t receive the most stellar reviews all around, it has become one of my favorites of the year.
Here, Fassbender demonstrates his capacity to harness the energy of a persona, a digital revolutionary icon, a man who was polarizing as a simultaneously volatile and brilliant charismatic leader. The acting by Fassbender and Kate Winslet (who also received a nomination) as marketing executive, Joanna Hoffman, lends brilliantly to the kinetic, quickly paced, dialogue-heavy script by Aaron Sorkin, who you may better know (and thus understand the tone of “Jobs”) by looking at his other work like “The Social Network” and HBO’s “The Newsroom.” I am of the belief that the performances in this film outweigh the final product in worth, and should be remembered for them.
All you horror film buffs out there, watch “It Follows” if you have yet to. The premise is simple: a 19-year-old girl named Jay (Maika Monroe) is followed by a slow, shape- shifting presence after having a strange sexual encounter. The titular “It” in the film does, of course, follow – constantly, wherever Jay goes; she knows that it is approaching and will inevitably reach her. Banding together with her siblings and friends, journeying through a seemingly abandoned Detroit, Jay must find a way to combat “It,” and be ridden of this sinister force that has taken over her world.
This is not a simple tale of a haunting; there isn’t a go-to solution to the problem –
no exorcisms, no holy incense. Complicating things, the source of evil can show itself in the appearance of a loved one, dead or alive or else a total stranger. Everything is uncertain, and that is the truly horrifying element in this story. I suggest adding it to your list, especially if you’re into stylized films, as the setting lends to a weird, quasi-80’s visualization, and the electronic soundtrack adds to that feeling as well. The film has a very classic vibe, harkening back to old school flicks like “Halloween” — “It Follows” pays tribute to those films without seeming unoriginal.
 “The End of the Tour” is a film that received far too little attention, one that can be especially appreciated by people in the arts. Jesse Eisenberg plays journalist David Lipsky, who spent time on a book tour in the late 90‘s with famous post-modern novelist David Foster Wallace, portrayed by Jason Segel, known for his epic “Infinite Jest” — a massive tome that many regard as a masterpiece. Wallace committed suicide several years later, prompting Lipsky to dig up his old interview tapes and reflect on his time and lengthy conversations with the enigmatic man.
This film is fairly low-key in regard to how contained it is in scope. It is a road movie at heart; two men on a book tour, talking it out, reflecting on and divulging their inner philosophies, like a couple of kids looking up into the stars late at night for the first time. This might seem boring to some, but I found it to be one of the most engaging films of the year. The conversations and dialogue guide the thematic momentum and provide a rich sense of existential quality to the interactions between the characters.
Other notables for the year include dark comedy “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” the very quirk filled Western “Slow West,” (also starring Fassbender) and Netflix original “Beasts of No Nation,” which tells the devastating story of an African child soldier.

The Steinberg Museum, located in Hillwood Commons, is home to many different types of art exhibits throughout the year. The museum is currently holding an exhibit by Carol Tabler through March 25. Tabler is a local collector and adjunct professor of art history, who currently teaches continuing education.
The work in Tabler’s collection is that of 19th century French landscape. This exhibit was based on the idea that the 19th century was a period of great revolutionary change in art making. Tabler has built the exhibition around this great period of change. These paintings are by many different French artists, as early as the 1800s. All of the paintings seen on display are more than 100 years old.
The idea of this exhibition is to expose the community to high quality artwork. The campus museum holds public lectures and events to explore new ideas. “Our mission as an institution is to consistently provide a space that explores the visual arts,” said Barbara Applegate, the director of the Steinberg Museum.
Niria Leyva Gutierrez, an assistant professor of art history and museum studies, often takes her art students to visit the museum. “The museum offers a respite from the demands of daily life or the stress related to academia. In the case of the Tabler exhibition, students are afforded the opportunity to delve deeply into the study of 19th century landscape painting,” she said.
“People come in every day with ideas for great exhibitions,” said Applegate. The museum takes a great deal of time planning for each event and exhibition. Events are planned between two and five years in advance. The events and holds four to five exhibitions each year. “Right now I’m thinking about the art exhibitions that will take place for the year 2020,” Applegate said.
Hillwood Commons, which was built in 1972, is one of the few spaces on Long Island that was built specifically for art viewing. Most spaces are retrofitted for viewing art, meaning they are built with a specific idea, but then are changed into a museum, according to Applegate.
Written on the walls of the museum specifically for this exhibition are the words, “L’amour du beau, love of the beautiful.” They denote mutual motivations, those of the collector with a passion for landscape art and those of the landscapist in his choice of a captivating motif.
Chrissy Christofakis, an art therapy student who works in the museum, said, “I love working here because the events are different each year. I think Tabler’s art is beautiful because of the way it makes you look at art differently,” she said. “I find it relatable to my own life.”
“People need to just get the one toe in the door to feel like they own this space,” said Applegate. The first connection with a space and the art that draws them in is what brings people back to the museum. “The thing that I think draws people is the notion of change that occurs three or four times a year, which is very important to me. The dynamic quality is what should draw people in,” said Applegate.
The Steinberg Museum is open Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The Tabler exhibit runs through March 25.

After 11 years of development, Marvel Comics character Deadpool, finally received his own movie, and it couldn’t be better. The lenghthy development time was due to revolving directors, the property being moved to different movie studios and footage of the movie being leaked several years ago. In a time when up to seven comic book movies are released per year, it’s refreshing to see a movie subvert the genre and stay true to its comic origin.
In the case of “Deadpool” that means a rated ‘R’ superhero movie that takes place in the same universe as 2014’s “X-Men Days of Future Past,” and shows the antihero, Deadpool, breaking the fourth wall by talking to the audience while saying and doing incredibly graphic things on screen.
The film stars Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson, a former mercenary who is diagnosed with terminal cancer and agrees to take part in an experimental program to become a superhero. After going through the program, he gains mutant abilities and adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Deadpool’s powers include healing factors, which makes him immortal and allow him to heal any injury.
Monera Baccarin stars as Vanessa, Wade’s girlfriend and later fiancé. T.J. Miller plays Wade’s friend Weasel and Ed Skrein plays Ajax. Reynolds is the standout in the movie, however; he is the perfect actor to play Deadpool due to his comedic timing and love for the character.
The plot of “Deadpool” is pretty simple: part origin story from the comics and part revenge movie. In the first half of the movie, the story cycles back and forth from past to present, with flashbacks showing how Wade became Deadpool and present day as Deadpool searches for Ajax. In the second half of the movie, Deadpool goes on a revenge quest to find Ajax and get back Vanessa.
While “Deadpool” may not have the most inventive plot for a superhero movie, it more than makes up for in its script and characters. The script is full of jokes, with several coming each minute.
Since Deadpool is the only character in the Marvel universe that breaks the fourth wall and knows he is a comic book character, it presents some great opportunities for different kinds of humor. One of the best jokes is when Deadpool makes fun of Reynolds for playing the Green Lantern in the 2011 film.
While Deadpool is by far the best character in the movie, the secondary characters are great as well. Since Deadpool takes place in the “X-Men” universe, several X-Men show up, including Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The two have great banter with Deadpool and take part in some great action scenes toward the end of the movie.
The computer-generated images (CGI), are also one of the strongest parts of the movie. First time director, Tim Miller, co-founded a visual effects studio in 1995, and his experience shows. The action scenes look great with the help of CGI and the audience is able to see what is happening without multiple cuts being made throughout the scenes. Colossus is also entirely computer generated and fits in with the world Miller and the visual effects studios have created.
There are not many negative aspects in the movie. Besides a less than stellar plot, viewers not familiar with the character may be put off by the humor. Weasel and Deadpool’s roommate, Blind Al, also disappear for the last quarter of the movie.
In the beginning of the movie, Deadpool tells the audience that this is a different kind of superhero story, and he is completely right. Viewers going into “Deadpool” expecting a movie similar to “X-Men” or “The Avengers” might be disappointed with the content. However, viewers who are familiar with the character and his comic book series will not find a better adaptation.
“Deadpool” pushed the ‘R’ rating to its edge; it is possibly the truest movie adaptation of the character that fans will see until the sequel. “Deadpool” is now in theaters with a sequel currently in development.

Adam Winne, a senior accounting major from Ridgefield, Conn. serves as the goalkeeper for the men’s lacrosse team. Winne is coming off a monumental 2015 campaign where he was named East Coast Conference goalie of the year, ECC Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player and was also named to the All-ECC First Team.
In his junior season, Winne led the conference in several categories including minutes played, goals-against average, save percentage and win percentage. With the season offcially underway, Winne hopes to lead the Pioneers to a National Championship.
Q: Describe how it felt when you were named East Coast Conference Goalie of the Year last season. Would you say that is your biggest individual accomplishment?
A: An attackman on Molloy broke the news to me during a game. I thought he was just blowing smoke up my rear, but he turned out to be right. I’d say it’s my biggest accomplishment individually, considering we play among some great company in the ECC.
Q: What is your biggest goal as a team this season following another incredible run in the NCAA Tournament?
A: Here at Post, we have the same goal every year, and that’s to bring home an NCAA title. Look out Philadelphia.
Q: What was the deciding factor that influenced your decision to come to Post and why?
A: I had an unreal visit to campus when I was still in high school. The Dizzy Lizard stole my heart.
Q: As a senior with a lot of experience, how does your leadership brush off on the younger players?
A: As a salty veteran, you just want to set a good example for the younger guys on the field, in the classroom, and at the tailgate after the game.
Q: Can you describe the feeling of playing in a National Championship game and how you mentally prepare for it?
A: Playing in the National Championship game back in 2014 was special. I wasn’t the starting goalie at the time, but I got a solid minute of burn when our keeper took an unnecessary roughness penalty before Coach Jez called timeout just to get me out there. As for preparation, you just have to treat it like any other game.
Q: What is the strongest asset of your game?
A: I try to bring a blue-collar work ethic to practice with me every day.
Q: What are your other hobbies besides playing lacrosse?
A: I got a sewing machine for Christmas and I’ve been on a spree ever since. As an avid roller coaster enthusiast, I’ve been to all major theme parks in the Northeast. My roommate Billy Ardamis and I play chess on the regular, which sometimes ends violently. I also enjoy a nice game of solitaire.
Q: Have you always been a goalie, or have you played other positions?
A: I played attack for a couple of weeks when I started playing lacrosse in seventh grade. We didn’t have a designated goalie, so my coach had to nominate a new kid every game and hope his parents didn’t have a canary. When it was my turn, I played well, so I decided to stick with it after my coach agreed to let me skip out on the running.
Q: Can you describe your daily routine as a student-athlete?
A: There’s definitely not a lot of down time on weekdays. I usually roll out of bed around 9:15 a.m. just in time for my 9:30 class. During common hour, I head to everyone’s favorite Winnick Dining Hall for some clean eats. Then, I go up and down at practice from 1:30-4:30 p.m. Before my night class, I’ll throw on a Disney movie, maybe Fantasia, it depends. After my night class, I fast until 10 p.m., then I head to Tex-Mex with likeminded males for an enchilada-style burrito at half-price.
Q: Who is your favorite athlete and why?
A: Wayne Gretzky takes the cake for me; he transcended the sport of hockey and he’s Canadian.
Q: Where do you see yourself five years from now? Do you plan to take a shot at the professional level or pursue a career elsewhere?
A: I hear Thailand is pretty rad, but we’ll see. Even if I could play in the pros, I wouldn’t want to be demonized by shooters in the MLL (Major League Lacrosse). Playing goalie in college can be frightening because some shooters can really bring the mustard, but playing goalie in the pros can be a death wish.
Q: What is your favorite part about playing lacrosse?
A: Always trips with the guys, although post-game tailgate food comes in at a close second.

“Pioneers” echoed from the Pratt Recreation Center stand on Thursday, Feb. 19, both in words and on the mat, as the wrestling team ripped off their opponent’s one defeat after another.
The referee raised Pioneer fists in the air on shuffle mode, all but twice throughout the evening. The home team whipped Mount Saint Vincent to numbness in the first dual, 56-0, and conquered NYU just hours later by a score of 32-8.
The first match against Mount Saint Vincent started off in favor of the Pioneers; however, Mount Saint Vincent was subject to five forfeits in various weight classes, which counted for 30 of the final Pioneer points. But the handful of Pioneers who did see action in the first leg all won nonetheless.
In the second match, the home side suffered backlash right off the bat. Freshman Joe Paterno’s suit wasn’t warm enough, as he was left with a forfeit victory earlier on. But sophomore Joe Calderone quickly tied the match up, and thereafter the Pioneers saw wins in seven out of the remaining eight battles.
With the two victories, the Pioneers evened up their regular season record at 11-11. Head coach Joe Patrovich now prepares his team for the NCAA Division II Super Region I Tournament on Friday, Feb. 26, at Mercyhearst University.

Black History Month happens over the course of the month of February and is an empowering month to all in the African-American community. It is a time when we trace our ancestry back and learn about the many famous African-Americans that have made great contributions to the history of this country and the world itself.
Why don’t I give all of you some quick trivia before we start? Black History Month actually began as “Negro History Week” and was created by famed African-American historian, Carter G. Woodson in 1926. It eventually became a month long celebration in 1976 as the month of February was chosen to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln respectively.
John Mercer Langston was the first black man to become a lawyer in Ohio in 1854. When he was elected town clerk in Brownhelm, Ohio, in 1855, Langston became one of the first African-Americans ever elected to public office in America. Langston was also the great-uncle of Langston Hughes, famed poet of the Harlem Renaissance.
Another amazing fact is that in the 1930s, famed painter Charles Alston founded the “306” group, which congregated in his studio space and provided support and apprenticeship for young African-American artists, including Langston Hughes, sculptor Augusta Savage and the mixed-media visionary, Romare Bearden. These people are only the tip of the iceberg in an incredibly extensive timeline of black history.
However, after doing much research and learning more about my ancestors I ask this question: Do we really need a black history month? I asked several black students on and off our campus and they all had one similar opinion, which was that our race needs a black history month to trace back our heritage.
“It is a month to embrace our roots and what we stand for,” said Erik Washington, sophomore electrical and computer engineering major at NYIT. Another opinion by Linesha Davis, sophomore biology major at NYIT, had a different train of thought. “Black History can’t be contained. Every day is black history and should be celebrated as such, not just in February.”
To go along the lines of Davis and Washington, Ayneesha Taylor, a graduate phychology major, said, “I think that it’s necessary because while we have more than just a month of history, it’s necessary to remind us of our history and to teach the youth of their history that they aren’t being taught in schools.”
I agree that our history shouldn’t be relegated and centralized down to just one month. Before anyone gets all riled up, I think many would agree that for all the contributions African-Americans have made to the world, just as other cultures, we shouldn’t keep them tied down to just one month of celebrating their history. Everyday should be another day of celebrating the pride you have in your race and culture.
That said, here is my issue with Black History Month in America. Many seem to think that celebrating it means just paying homage to a couple main black historical figures: Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, along with Jackie Robinson.
Now, nothing should ever be taken away from what these activists have done for black people, and even this country itself, but they are not the only black people to have made major contributions to history. Why don’t we hear more about George Washington Carver, inventor of more than 300 different uses for the peanut; or Hiram Rhodes Revels, the first African-American to be elected to the U.S. Senate; or even Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to the House of Representatives?
I could go on and on and write a book if I wanted to. If black history is going to be restricted to just a month then shouldn’t we as a society use each day to learn more than just a few famous black people?
As previously stated, I agree with it being necessary, but not to be a reminder of where we came from. It should be used to educate the next generation on the famous African-Americans that they don’t learn about in schools today.
Black history is more than just slavery and racism. Black history is an underappreciated chapter of world history, dating all the way back to ancient Egypt. In fact, actor Morgan Freeman called Black History Month ridiculous. Of course this statement was taken out of context but the point still stands; it is ridiculous to an extent but also necessary because in the world today, if you truly want to learn then you have to do it yourself.
Overall, I love my ancestors, and much of what we enjoy today wouldn’t have been possible without any of their contributions to world history. I love my people and I’m proud to say that I always make it a point to learn something new about my race every day. Hopefully, people will take a more active role in learning black history or teaching it to their kids. Give them some guidance. Show them where they came from and that greatness is always possible. Let’s prove that what our ancestors fought for and gave their entire lives for was more than just a dream.

Coming o a tough loss to NYIT, the women’s basketball team looked to rebound against Daemen College on Friday, Feb. 19, in Amherst, N.Y. The tightly contested game came down to the final minute of play, and Daemen scratched out a 57-53 win over the Pioneers.
The Pioneers kept themselves within striking distance early and trailed 32-26 at the break. Eight players contributed on the offensive side in the first half, led by junior forward Janaysia James who had six points.
After a third quarter which saw the Pioneers climb back into the game, they opened the fourth quarter on a 5-0 run, which put them ahead 46-44. Khea Gibbs made a big basket down the stretch to tie the game at 51, but Daemen outscored the Pioneers by four in the game’s last minute.
James finished with a team-high 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds while junior forward Melsha Messam added 13 points and brought down 12 boards. Freshman guard Shannon Doyle also chipped in with five points, four rebounds, three assists and four steals.
In their next matchup against Roberts Wesleyan College on Sunday, Feb. 21, the Pioneers were again handed another loss; this one by a score of 67-60 from Rochester, N.Y.
The Pioneers got off to a strong start and took a 32-29 lead into the break. The Pioneers were led by Messam, who had 10 points at intermission, followed by Doyle, who had nine, and senior guard Jalyn Brown, who had two shots from behind the arc.
In the second half, Roberts Wesleyan began to break down the Pioneer defense and chip into the deficit. Behind 15 second half points from sophomore guard Brooke Fields, Roberts Wesleyan outscored the Pioneers by 10 and upended the Green and Gold.
Fields finished with 21 points while two other players recorded double-digit scoring outings, including senior forward Samantha Courtney, who also grabbed 11 boards for a double-double. For the Pioneers, Brown was the high scorer with 16 while Messam notched 11 points and 11 rebounds.

In what was nearly a comeback for the ages, the men’s basketball team (16-10) survived for an 80-73 victory against East Coast Conference arch-nemesis, New York Institute of Technology (3-21), on Thursday, Feb. 16, in the Battle of the Boulevard at the Pratt Recreation Center.
The Pioneers erupted in the first half as they kicked off the contest with a 14-2 run in the first four minutes of action. Senior guard Akosa Maduegbunam had the hot hand early; nailing back-to-back three pointers and sophomore forward Hunter Powell tallied five points for the hosts.
A remarkable opening stanza for the Pioneers ended in a 15-2 burst anchored by Maduegbunam, who scored seven points to bring his total up to 13. Junior forward Greg Dotson also provided nine points and seven rebounds for the Green and Gold in the first twenty minutes. The Pioneers brought a 47-24 cushion into the locker room after senior guard Devon McMillan scooped in a buzzer-beating lay-up.
However, the second half was a completely different story as the Bears offense began to come to life after being ice cold in the first half. The Bears tore up the Pioneers defense behind the lights of senior guard Khalif Chaplin who poured in 26 points on the evening, with 19 coming in the latter stanza. NYIT eventually narrowed the deficit to five points (72-67) with 2:11 left in regulation.
Junior guard Jared Hall had other plans though; he knocked down four clutch free-throws in that final stretch, securing the win for the Pioneers. Also, Dotson and Maduegbunam each knocked down a pair of foul shots during that juncture.
Hall finished with 20 points off the bench for the Pioneers followed by Maduegbunam who posted 17 points and seven rebounds. Although Dotson had a quiet second half, he still earned a double-double with 13 points and 11 boards.
Coach Smiles and his Pioneers squad squeezed out another nail-biter on Friday, Feb. 19, when they ousted Daemen College, 88-76, in another ECC matchup at Lumsden Gymnasium in Amherst, N.Y.
In a game that was headlined with runs, the Pioneers went on an 11-1 uproar in just under two minutes to jump in front of the Wildcats, 41-40. Dotson put the visitors ahead with 17 ticks remaining in the opening period, scoring the last five points of the burst.
Although they trailed 42-41 at the intermission, the Pioneers offense clicked on all cylinders, as they shot the ball just under 42 percent from the eld and 70 percent from downtown.
Hall scored eight points during a 14-2 streak to open up the second half, putting the Pioneers in front for good. The Green and Gold refused to look back and eventually extended their lead to double-digits, going up 86-74, with just over a minute left on the game clock.
For the second straight outing, Hall was the game’s leading scorer with 20 points. He also had seven rebounds and five assists. Senior guard Dillon Burns racked up 10 points in addition to his seven helpers and five boards. In 21 minutes off the bench, McMillan logged 12 points while Maduegbunam chipped in again with eight points and five boards.
The Pioneers currently sit at 11-7 and fourth place in conference play as they look to lock up a spot in the ECC Tournament when they play host to the University of the District of Colombia on Saturday, Feb. 27, on Senior Day. Tip-off is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.

On Saturday, Feb. 20, the no. 3 ranked men’s lacrosse team got their season underway against no. 4 ranked Merrimack College in a non-conference game in Massachusetts.
It didn’t start off well for the Pioneers, as Merrimack came out of the gate strong with two goals separated by less than two minutes in the first period. Post, however, was able to regain their composure and strike back with three unanswered goals to take a 3-2 lead.
In that span, senior attackman Matty Beccaris scored one goal and assisted on another. At halftime, the Pioneers trailed 5-4.
In the third period, the Pioneers jumped out in front 7-5, thanks to three straight goals; two from senior mid elder Anthony Berardis and one from senior attackman Ryan Slane.
Merrimack, who needed a spark to get back in the game, got one from Ryan Poirier. The senior midfielder scored two straight goals to tie the match at seven and began what would be a 5-0 run by Merrimack to go ahead 10-7 with 6:22 left in regulation.
Slane and Beccaris notched two goals to bring the Pioneers within one, but two more goals from Poirier put the game out of reach.
The Pioneers fell by a score of 12-10. Beccaris led the Pioneers offensively with four points while Berardis, Slane and senior attackman Matt Bellando had three points each. Junior midfielder Anthony Galeotafiore won 60 percent of his faceoffs and scooped up five ground balls.
Head Coach Jon Jez and his team are back in action again on Saturday, Feb. 27, when they play host to Adelphi University. Opening faceoff is set for noon.

The women’s lacrosse team is coming off an extremely successful 2015 campaign, where it went 15-4 and an impressive 8-0 in conference play.
The woman who is leading the Pioneers is Meghan McNamara. In her almost 10 years at Post as head coach of women’s lacrosse, McNamara has won nearly 87 percent of her games. Her track record makes her one of the finest lacrosse coaches in the country. When asked what improvements could be made to her team, she said, “This year, we are working on our confidence as a team and performing at the level that we know we can play every day and becoming a stronger team unit because of that.”
Confidence didn’t seem to be something the Pioneers lacked last season. In their victories a year ago, they won by an average of 14 goals. This is an incredible statistic and McNamara gives much of the credit to her players. “We are very lucky that we have
a strong defensive unit, as well as having relentless players on the draw circle that helps us get possession of the ball.” McNamara continued to say the team takes
a lot of pride in following possession successes with points and they have a lot of fun on the eld.
McNamara expects a lot from her players, but does have goals she wants the team to accomplish. One of the biggest is to be the best teammate you can be.
McNamara said her team is inspired by George Boiardi, a former Cornell men’s lacrosse player, after they read his story last fall in the Jon Gordon book, “Hard Hat.” In a nutshell, the book goes into the life of Boiardi, who tragically lost his life playing the sport he loved in 2004. Gordon examines his life as a player, person and as a teammate. “Great teammates don’t just impact you today; they impact you for the rest of your life,” Gordon says in the book.
Recently, the Pioneers were ranked sixth in the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association Division II Preseason Poll. In response to the ranking, McNamara said, “I do not look at rankings honestly. I had no idea we were placed sixth.” She continued, “When we focus on ourselves and what we can control, everything else will fall into place when the time comes.”
Other than winning games, the Pioneers ultimately want to get better as a unit. “Our time together is very important and special and we are continuing to focus on us, this team and our time together,” McNamara said.
McNamara and Co. kick start their season on Tuesday, March 1, when they welcome Nyack College to Brookville, N.Y. Game-time is set for 3 p.m.

On Sunday, Feb. 21, the swimming team won the three-day Metropolitan Conference Championship at the Rutgers University Aquatic Center in Piscataway, N.J.
“We performed so well because we train so hard. There’s no way around it,” said Seren Jones, senior team captain for the pioneers. She credits the team of 13 for having trained harder than ever to be able to defend the Conference title for the fourth consecutive year.
The Pioneers kicked o with a big splash already in heat one. Seniors Joyce Kwok, Jones, and Meghan Brazier teamed up with sophomore Laura Bendfeldt to record a school-best in the 200-yard freestyle relay. Two seconds ahead of the runners-up, the team clocked in at 1:32:03.
“We earned the A cut time, which means we automatically qualified for NCAAs,” Jones said. “We’re currently number one in the nation.”
With four out of five wins on the first day, the chances of improving were slim. But Kwok did her part to spice up the numbers even more with another school record, timed at an NCAA “A” cut of 53:32 in the 100-yard butterfly event.
Others performed atop, as well. Freshman Karis Fuller dictated the 400-yard individual medley, and freshman Caitlin Johnstone swam home gold in the 100-yard breast event.
As the final day came to a close, the Pioneers had collected 1,116 points. Kwok had, again, spurted away in her category, the 200- yard butterfly event. And Johnstone recorded her second breaststroke heat, the 200-yard stanza, with a personal best.
The Pioneers, lead by head coach Michael Travers, now prepare for the National Championships in Indianapolis, Ind., which will be held on March 9-12.
Jones, who believes Nationals will be a greater challenge, hopes to spur her fellow teammates to enjoy themselves. “Despite being number one in the relay we’re still underdogs in a sense because we’re not a big, renowned swim team,” she said. “We have to step up against the big dogs now and show them how far we’ve come, and that we deserve to be successful.”

Many classrooms in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, Pell Hall, Kahn Hall, Life Science and Humanities Hall, have undergone changes within the past year to enhance the teaching and learning infrastructure. The information technology department has partnered with facilities to upgrade classroom spaces; the ultimate goal in mind: upgrade over 100 classrooms 2017.
Renovations started over the summer of 2015, and have continued since. Forty-five classrooms were upgraded with new technology in several building on campus, according the IT Department.
The most recent renovation was done in Humanities Hall, room 119, which was finished during winter break. Televisions were installed on either side of the room as well as charging stations. New carpeting was added as well.
Michael Soupios, professor of political science, who teaches several classes in room 119, is known for writing notes on the chalkboard. “The renovations are great, but l am an old dog, slow to learn new tricks,” he stated when asked why he continues to use the chalkboard instead of the new SMART Board.
The renovated learning spaces, also referred to as “SMART classrooms” are equipped with multimedia features, including multi-touch Epson wireless data projection, centralized Simple Creston control panel system, wall-mounted audio speakers, a whiteboard that doubles as a surface for projection and for traditional whiteboard use; and standard VGA/HDMI ports to connect your laptop.
Gary Miller, the lab manager for the computer grahics department, stated that the computer graphics labs are also in the process of being upgraded. The boards are in the process of being equipped with a menu-driven software that is required to communicate with the computers.
Blake Alessi, a senior public relations major, believes that the new technology in the classrooms are a worthwhile improvement. “The new SMART Boards are great. I wish they would have had them when I started here, students now are constantly using technology, so learning on the new SMART Boards compared to old white boards is great,” he said. Students are now constantly using technology, so learning on the new SMART Boards compared to old whiteboards is great,” he added.

Campus Life is bringing a new event to campus, Cultural Explosion. The event will take place on Feb. 24, in Hillwood Commons at 6 p.m. According to Christopher Whitehead, Campus Life programming specialist, this is the first year the event is being held. It was created by Director of Campus Life, Michael Berthel.
Whitehead said that Berthel got the idea to bring Cultural Explosion to Post after meeting with students, and he “used to put on this event at his alma mater, Adelphi University.”
Caitlin Kennedy, a study abroad ambassador at Post, describes it as “a fun, informative event” with “games, food and music from various cultures as well as presentations by international students.” The activities will represent multiple cultures from around the world. Kennedy will be sharing her experiences while studying abroad.
The event will take place throughout Hillwood Commons in the East West Café, the shbowl and the lobby. “We wanted to focus on the fun aspect of culture,” Whitehead said.
Kennedy said she is excited to share her experiences while studying in Spain and Peru with other students. “I enjoy any opportunity I have to inspire other people to travel,” she said. “ This is a venue that allows them to experience other cultures to a degree while staying very close to home.”

In the opening months of the spring semester, Post was hit with two snowstorms in January and February.
Due to Winter Storm Jonas, all LIU campuses were closed from Friday, Jan. 22
to Sunday, Jan. 24.
On Monday, Jan. 25, LIU campuses were open despite snow fall still on some roads and pathways. Like LIU, Adelphi closed and Stony Brook had a delayed opening until 1 p.m. Hofstra also had a delayed opening, and Molloy College and all St. John’s campuses in New York were closed. Yet, last year, LIU campuses closed on Jan. 27, 2015, due to 9.5 inches of snow in the surrounding area of Glen Cove. All LIU campuses reopened the following day.
Senior psychology major Nicole Balnis feels “there should be a set amount of [snow] days. I do believe that they do add some into the schedule though.” Balnis also believes “there should be a set number [of inches] so that everyone knows when school will and will not be closed.”
More snow fell a week later. On Friday, Feb. 5, the school originally announced a delayed opening until noon, but then closed the campus later in the day. According to Patch.com, Old Brookville received 8 inches of snow by 12 p.m.
Again, on Monday, Feb. 8, all classes were cancelled after 4 p.m. due to the weather conditions. An emergency text was sent out around 2:10 p.m., notifying students, faculty and staff of the cancellation. In preparation for the snowstorm, Mayor de Blasio issued a travel advisory from Monday, Feb. 8 to Wednesday, Feb. 10, according to pix11.com.
According to Joe Schaefer, LIU’s new chief of administration and student affairs, “in the event of inclement weather, our facilities, Public Safety, and Student Life work closely together to determine campus closures or delayed openings if conditions are deemed too severe.
There are no days designated as ‘snow days’ built into the academic calendar. We take into account that the University may close due to weather-related emergencies and are prepared for such contingencies,” he said.
When deciding if the campus should close due to weather conditions, the weather
is not always the determining factor. “A variety of factors such as the predicted conditions, scheduled events and the academic needs of the students are carefully measured before making any decision. We also receive updates from the National Weather Service and Nassau County Office of Emergency Management and local police in the case of extreme weather,” Schaefer said.
Schaefer stated that in the case of bad weather, faculty, staff and students are notied of the status of the campus and classes through texts, email, the school website and social media. There is also an emergency hotline students can call to stay up to date on the weather conditions. If the snow is manageable, facilities, Public Safety and Student Life will clear the parking lots and roads on campus “to ensure the safety of our students, faculty and staff and to keep our facilities open to serve the Post community,” Schaefer said.
