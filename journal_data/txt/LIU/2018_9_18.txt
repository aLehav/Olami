Nike’s latest ad campaign featuring ex-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has reignited the debate on football players protesting during the national anthem. The issue, on both the professional and collegiate levels, raises questions concerning an athlete’s right to stand up for what they believe in versus the obligation they hold to the organization under which they play.
The movement, which began with Kaepernick in 2016, sparked a divide across the nation: some people view the acts as disrespectful and unpatriotic, while others empathize with players and their right to exercise the First Amendment. A third party simply wants to enjoy the game and keep football and politics separate. One thing to be agreed on is that it is a tough issue on both a systematic and social level.
In May, the NFL issued a new rule prior to the 2018 season, which states that all players must stand for the national anthem, but gives them the option of returning to the locker room if they decide not to. 
This issue is not limited to the NFL though. Some college football programs, such as Michigan and Michigan State, have encountered similar protests to the anthem by their players, with some sitting in prayer or raising their fists during the “Star-Spangled Banner.” This creates a new challenge for colleges to navigate.
Currently, the NCAA has no specific rules in place to regulate any player protests, leaving the matter in the hands of each individual college program. 
LIU Post does not have any written rules concerning players and the national anthem and has not experienced players kneeling during the anthem, according to Bryan Collins, the head football coach. 
“We have the national anthem before kickoff after the coin toss,” Collins said. “It’s something that’s ingrained in us as something we respect and we do, as far as a department, as well as a football program, and I don’t think there’s been a situation when any of our players have thought anything differently,” he added.
Prior to kickoff at each football game, the players and staff stand for the national anthem, a tradition which Collins says is not shown on TV or even during a live stream, making the point that there is not the same stage for a protest as in the NFL, due to lack of coverage and viewership. 
“I think it’s a different set of circumstances as far as the outreach on a message that you want to send. This is not the NFL, there aren’t millions of people watching. Our attention in the pregame should be towards our game,” Collins said.
Greg Powell, sophomore psychology major and quarterback, agrees that the spotlight is much bigger for those in the NFL. “I think it’s a very good platform to use it for. It’s obviously getting a lot of attention. They should definitely use the platform that they have right now to spread the message and getting people talking,” he said.
Despite the NFL and collegiate football being on two separate platforms, Collins insists on the importance of listening to any and all of his players’ concerns. He believes in maintaining the notion of comradery.
“I think it’s always good to lead the discussion on something that might bother one of the players on the team. If it affects a small group of players on our team then it affects all of us,” he said. “Everybody is effected as part of the team and part of the program, so if somebody has some thoughts or something they want to share with the rest of us, we certainly have that communication.”

Campus life is completely different for a commuter than it is for a student dorming on campus.
Commuters spend less time on campus and therefore have to pile classes into two or three days a week, which can be stressful. Resident students are able to scatter their classes throughout the week, making time management and scheduling easier.

While my friends were hard at work trying to decide on the dream colleges, I was figuring out the easiest way to save money for my family, and at the same time get the education I deserved. I knew commuting was going to be one of my biggest challenges when I enrolled here last year. Yet, the people I’ve met and the friendships I’ve shared have made commuting from Miller Place in Suffolk County an effortless trip.
Commuting from over an hour away has its downsides. Traffic on the Long Island Expressway every morning makes a cup of coffee and loud music a must. When driving alone, not being able to utilize the HOV lane or have someone else to talk to during the drive can also be challenging.
A long commute minimizes the time spent socializing and studying. Students who dorm can socialize with their roommates and other students in their residence hall. Commuting students may feel that they can only stay for classes, knowing they have to drive far to get back home. However, they can still socialize with their peers in places like Hillwood Commons.
While dorming has its perks, I find my best work is done in my house where distractions are minimal and help is just an email away. Leaving my family for a long period of time is something I wouldn’t be able to do. I enjoy the drive and the company I’m greeted by every day when I arrive on campus.
Commuting students can still be outgoing and personable with others on campus. My personality has brought me a long way at this school, and the great friends I’ve made since last year have impacted my college career forever.

Public libraries are an essential part of society, even in the advanced technological age. Though in-person library use has gone down, a 2016 survey from the Pew Research Center shows only a slight decline. According to the survey, the highest percentage of public library visitors happened to be millennials.
Thomas D. Walker, dean of the Palmer School of Library and Information Science, is not surprised that 18 to 35-year-olds make up 53 percent of public library visitors. “They’re in a position where they are relatively young and they’re exploring life,” Walker said. “Libraries have been associated with those things for decades.”
One cannot talk about public libraries today without mentioning technology. With electronic reading devices and movie streaming services, it almost seems like libraries will become obsolete in the near future.
Dr. Panos Mourdoukoutas, chairperson of the economics department, recently argued on Forbes. com in an editorial on July 21, 2018, that Amazon Books should replace public libraries. This, he wrote, would help save taxpayer dollars. The editorial, which has since been taken down from the website, caused uproar. “I don’t think I’ve seen anything that got folks so riled up as that,” said David Jank, a professor of Library Science.
Meghan Collins, a second year Library Science student, believes that all kinds of technology have
a place in public libraries. “I think there should be more technology in the libraries,” said Collins. “I’ve seen 3D printers in libraries, and there should be classes with different types of technology.”
When it comes to getting people to continue using public libraries, it is up to patrons to spread the word. “It’s like any word of mouth advertising,” said Jank. “If I get something at a library, I’ll tell my family and my friends. I love when I’m at a restaurant or at a store and I overhear someone say, ‘Oh, you’ll never guess what I saw at the library.’”
Librarians also have an important task at publicity. “Librarians should keep doing what they’re doing,” said Walker. “They’re doing a spectacular job at engaging communities. They work on this around the clock. Not just the reading needs, but educational needs, cultural needs, and community needs of their populations. They analyze and reanalyze the communities in which they establish themselves in.”
When asked what she enjoys most about public libraries, Collins couldn’t decide on just one aspect. “There’s so many great things about it,” she said. “The books, the movies. You can take classes, you can have help finding something. Everyone is just so friendly there.”
One thing that people seem to agree on is that the public libraries aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. “They are very strong,” said Walker. “They receive a huge amount of community support.”

The Student Government Association (SGA) is preparing now to set in motion their plans for the fall semester.
Erica Ferrara, a senior geology and environmental sustainability major, is the Vice President of the SGA. She said that SGA serves as a way of giving students a voice when interacting with the school’s administration.
“[SGA is] a council of students, [including] both undergraduate and graduate students. We essentially represent the student body when advocating to the administration,” Ferrara said.
The SGA has an agenda or a set of  goals that they have for the semester, and each individual officer has a set of goals they would like to accomplish during their term.
“My plans this year is to work with student organizations and support them through collaboration. I want to work with them to strengthen their member base and programming events,” Ferrara said of her own goals. “I act as a resource for them when they have any questions about the new 5 star accreditation program.” 
Ferrara also mentioned that she plans to focus time on expanding and growing clubs on campus, and helping with the new 5 star accreditation program created by the administration.
The “5 star accreditation” is a set of criteria that a club or organization must complete to obtain a ‘5 star rating,’ or the best possible rating on campus. Also referred to as “Raising Expectations,” the rubric for reaching this status was updated in August of 2018. 
Ferrara also discussed her goal of giving the entire university a voice through an anonymous comment form.
“I want students to have a voice, and for them to use that voice to stimulate positive change for this university,” she explained. “To do that, I am working on creating an anonymous comment form where students can submit any concerns they have and our new council can address these concerns accordingly.” 
The anonymous comment form is meant to allow students that may not feel comfortable with putting themselves out there publically to have their concerns addressed.
Ferrara discussed the goals of the executive board as a whole, saying that  “this year, we as an e-board, and a council want to continue supporting students and give them the best possible experience they can have here at LIU. We would like to continue working through our committees to improve Academics, Public Safety, Facilities, and Student Engagement.” 
Each of these areas are a part of LIU that has a specific focus on campus and interacts with students very frequently. 
“We would like to continue to work on side door access from 7-7, improve student-administration relations, and create an even stronger SGA council that will be able to work with more students to create a better LIU,” Ferrara noted.
Last semester Public Safety experimented with allowing side door access to Brookville hall from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m., as side door access was blocked after 7 p.m. previously  for all halls. This concern had been brought to SGA last semester, and they began working to expand side door access.
While the SGA officers have already been chosen, there is still a chance to get involved this semester.
“Our fall application to apply for SGA will be out shortly and everyone will get an email at their LIU emails about it. We are very excited to welcome new senators and a new class president for our freshman class. I encourage everyone who is passionate about making change on this campus to apply,” Ferrara said.
