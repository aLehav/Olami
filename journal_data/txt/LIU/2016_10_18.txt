After starting the season 8-0 and climbing to the no. 1 ranking in Division II, the Pioneers hit a few bumps on the road. In the midst of a three-game losing streak, for which the team was on the wrong side of consecutive one-goal deciders, the field hockey team bounced back on Saturday, Oct. 15, in a 3-0 victory against Saint Michael’s College in Vermont.
Alyssa Lopresti led the Pioneer offense by notching all three goals for the hat-trick. The first tally came just two minutes and 45 seconds into the match. The goal there set the tone and the Pioneers didn’t let up, scoring less than ten minutes later to go up 2-0.
The Pioneers outshot the Purple Knights at a 17-3 clip, and limited the opposition to one total shot in the first half. In the second half, Lopresti finished off her afternoon with a 56th minute tally to put the Pioneers up 3-0, and give the team its ninth win of the season.   
Head Coach Raenee Savin and her squad return to the field on Wednesday, Oct. 19, when they travel to face Pace University. Game-time is scheduled for 4 p.m.

On the heels of a dramatic 2-1 victory over Mercy College, the Pioneers made quick work of Caldwell University, upending the guests 4-0 on Monday, Oct. 10, at the Pioneer Soccer Park in Brookville, N.Y.
The win, the team’s sixth in a row, pushes its record to 8-2-1. The scoring got underway in the 22nd minute when freshman forward Julia Duffy deflected a cross past the keeper. Just six minutes later, junior midfielder Klara Berggren put the Pioneers up two goals when she cleaned up a battle in front of the net.
Just before the half culmination, the Pioneers went up a thrice thanks to freshman midfielder Madina Mulic. Sophomore forward Andrea Huntzinger put the icing on the cake with the fourth and final goal on the afternoon in the 57th minute. The goal was her fourth of the season, good enough for a team high.
The game marked the team’s fourth straight shutout.
The Pioneers returned on Friday, Oct. 14, against Roberts Wesleyan College in Rochester, N.Y. Both sides struggled to get scoring opportunities, and the result was a nil-nil draw.
The Pioneers’ golden scoring chance came in the second half when Mulic sent a shot that hit
the post. The almost-game winner was the closest the Pioneers came. Roberts Wesleyan had some opportunities turned aside by sophomore keeper Hillevi Eklow, who made three saves in the extra sessions. The Pioneers owned a 13-11 shot advantage, but could not capitalize by pushing one across the line.
Mark Dawson and his team are back on the field Thursday, Oct. 20, when they visit Molloy College. Start time from Rockville Centre, N.Y., is set for 4 p.m.

After being slated at no. 2 in the latest National Soccer Coaches Association of America Division II Top-25-Poll, the men’s soccer team traveled to Rochester, N.Y., for a battle with Roberts Wesleyan College on Friday, Oct. 14.
Although the team owns the sixth-highest scoring average in Division II, its defense was its calling card as it pitched a 1-0 shutout for the 10th victory of the season. The Pioneers are currently 10-0-1 on the season, and 3-0-1 in conference play.
“The atmosphere is great,” said David Arvidsson, junior back and team captain, about the quest the team is on. “We have the mentality that we’re going to win the game regardless of the opponent, but it’s very important to always be humble.
The lone goal came in the 13th minute off the foot of Arvidsson. He ripped a shot over the goalie’s outstretched arms and under the crossbar for his first goal of the season. Senior midfielder Harry Pearse assisted on the goal.
The defense for the Pioneers was stellar, limiting Roberts Wesleyan to six shorts, non of which found the back of the net. On the flip side, the Pioneers totaled 12 shots, good enough for a 2:1 advantage, which helped the Pioneers come out with the victory. Pearse led the offense with his total of six shots, non of which connected.
In the net, senior goalkeeper Jesper Malmstrom tied a game-high in saves with five. “Not facing many shots is a sign that the team is doing well, both in possessing the ball and on defense,” Malmstrom said on his performance. “As a keeper you just have to make sure to be ready for the few game-changing moments, and do your part to keep a clean sheet.” Speaking of clean sheets, Malmstrom recorded his fourth shutout of the season.
In its next matchup against Daemen College on Sunday, Oct. 16, the team unleashed its prolific offense and exploded for seven first-half goals to win on enemy territory.
In the first half, Ardivsson and sophomore midfielder Charlie Ledula each netted two goals, while Pearse, sophomore back Nico Kjaer Andersen and freshman forward Gianluca Santacruz tallied single goals apiece. The Pioneers held a more than 20-shot edge against Daemen and cruised to an 8-1 victory.
Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and the Pioneers return to the pitch on Thursday, Oct. 20, against Molly College. Kickoff in Rockville Centre, N.Y., is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Seeking its seventh victory to open the season, the no. 14-ranked football team turned the ball over a season-high six times, but still managed to pull out the 30-23 win against Southern Connecticut State University from New Haven, Conn., on Saturday, Oct. 15.
The game-changing possession happened in the fourth quarter as the Pioneers were down, 16-14. Senior quarterback Jeff Kidd, who already had two interceptions on the day, orchestrated a seven-play, 75-yard drive that was capped with a 45-yard touchdown pass to redshirt junior receiver, Kyle Ward. The score gave the Pioneers a 20-16 advantage, one they wouldn’t relinquish from the final nine minutes.
Early in the game, it looked like a classic defensive stalemate as both sides traded zeroes for the first quarter. The second quarter was a different story, however, as the Owls cashed in at the eight-mintue mark. Off a Kidd interception, running back Eli Parks scampered for a 20- yard run to open up the scoring. Following another Kidd interception, the Owls scored again, this time from a 50-yard touchdown pass.
Coming off back-to-back turnovers, Kidd remained cool and connected with redshirt junior wide-out James Higgins on an 18-yard touchdown to trim the deficit to 13-7. That score would hold until the first half whistle. In the second half, the Pioneers drew first blood with a three-yard run by Kidd that put the Green and Gold up, 14-13. After a field goal by the Owls, the onus was again on Kidd and the offense to put up some points.
After a key third down conversion to keep their drive alive, Kidd hooked up with Ward on the go-ahead, and what turned our to be the game-winning score. On the next two Pioneer drives, the offense added 10 more points to give its defense a cushion. The game ended 30-23.
Kidd finished 19 of 28 for 225 yards with three touchdowns, and also ran for 30 yards a score on the ground. Redshirt senior receiver Shane Hubbard led the receiving corps for the Pioneers, snagging eight balls for 89 yards and a touchdown. Higgins and Ward also had scores.
Defensively, senior linebacker Nate Feliz was all over the field, totaling 10 tackler and also coming up with an interception. Redshirt junior defensive back Jared Chester accumulated six tackles, recovered a fumble, and came down with an interception. Head Coach Bryan Collins and the team are back in action on Saturday, Oct. 22, when they will try and keep their undefeated season alive against American International College. Kickoff from Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium is set for 1 p.m..
