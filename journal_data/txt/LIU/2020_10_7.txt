“The Boys” has gained popularity since its debut on Amazon Prime in July 2019 recently came out with a new season that premiered Sept. 4. When season one debuted last summer it was instantly a hit with audiences worldwide. Amazon announced shortly after its release that the show was “One of its most-watched series ever.” The show offers viewers profanity, violence, and more. 
As Nielsen’s Subscription Video on Demand content ratings stated, “The Boys” averaged 4.1 million viewers per episode over the first 10 days of its release. While the first season released all episodes in one day, the second season released the first three episodes on Sept. 4 with a new episode every Friday. The show has already been renewed for a third season due to its popularity. 
The show is about a group of vigilantes led by Billy Butcher who try and take down the corrupt superheroes who abuse their powers. These “Supes” as called in the show, are mostly using their powers for their own gain and popularity with no concern for anyone who gets in the way. Many characters in this show resemble famous characters like Aquaman and Superman and this helps the audience connect to them at the beginning of the show. However, when they see the damage the “Supes” do audience opinions change. 
Actor Karl Urban shows a very gritty, angry, and just all around crazy Billy Butcher and makes the character one you want to root for from the start. Another actor in the series is Antony Starr who plays Homelander, throughout the show, Starr shows all kinds of different emotions making him a very intimidating villain. 
James Waldhof, a senior broadcasting major, is a fan of the different take on the superhero genre. “Growing up watching the Avengers and superhero movies like that, this is a nice change to flip the script on superheroes.” As Waldhof shows this new spin on superheroes could make other shows in the future follow their lead. Waldhof admittedly said he was surprised at how much he liked the series in the beginning. “When I first started watching “The Boys” I wasn’t sure what to expect but I was surprised with how much I ended up enjoying it.” Waldhof recommends that others give this show a shot as well, with the fresh take on superheroes it could be just the show you need right now.

Post Theatre Company (PTC) has started rehearsals for one of their latest shows this season, “Lizzie the Musical”. This show is one of eight shows that PTC will produce and perform this semester. The cast consists of four actors and the director. 
Danny Walsh, is a senior musical theatre major, member of PTC, and the director of this production. “This is my first time directing and choreographing a full-length production completely on my own. I have worked as a choreographer for the entirety of my college years, however, this is the first show that I am completely on my own for when it comes to direction and choreography,” Walsh said, “It is quite daunting at times to be the captain of the ship, but this is my passion and there is nothing else that makes me happier than getting to direct and choreograph.”
“Lizzie the Musical”, is set to be streamed just in time for the Halloween season, on Oct 30, 2020. The show explores the mystery of Lizzie Borden, a woman who was accused of murdering her father and step-mother in 1892 with an ax. Her story became widely known by the popular nursery rhyme “Lizzie Borden took an ax / gave her mother forty whacks / when she saw what she had done / gave her father forty-one.” 
“The show speculates on motivations that she may have had: loss of inheritance, history of sexual abuse, overwhelming oppression, and madness,” said Walsh “While the show is told from the perspective that Lizzie committed these crimes, she actually was never found guilty for the murders that were committed as the all-male jury could not believe a woman would be able to commit such horrendous crimes.” 
The show will also feature a rock band that has been put together by Gregory Franz, a senior music education major. 
“These band members also did their work from their own individual living spaces.  Greg is the one responsible for editing the actors vocals on top of the band. After each number is recorded, the actors send their videos and vocal tracks to our video editor, Lizzy Lunardi, who is a freelance filmmaker based in Philadelphia,” said Walsh
Due to COVID-19, the show will be produced entirely online. As this show is a musical, it was decided by the head faculty that this, and other musicals in the season, must be done in an online setting for the safety of everyone who is involved. 
“The rehearsal process for this show is taking place on Zoom and every moment of the show has been recorded in each actor’s individual living space. The actors learn their music, learn their movement, and then after a rehearsal or two, we have a “recording day” where the actors set up their camera (or enlist, what we call, a camera buddy) and record their movement or dialogue.” Walsh said. 
“ It’s a little sad and weird that we can’t work together in person.  It’s harder to form character relationships with each other when most of the work is done on your own,” Cameron Park-Miller, a junior musical theatre major, said, “There are a lot of logistical things to work out: filming and vocal recording spaces/set up, finding props or set pieces among your own things, especially in the era of COVID when we can’t take masks off around others or share items,”
Park-Miller is a part of the cast of Lizzie. 
According to Leigh Dillon, a senior musical theatre major, the process of this show is different from previous productions she has been a part of. The added complication of COVID-19 has greatly impacted the process of producing a musical. 
“In the past, we were in person and we still would be working on sections of the show for it all to be put together at the end. However, instead of it all being performed live at once, we are working number by number, learning the staging then recording after, we then move on to the next number, do the same thing, and then each number is put together electronically,” Dillon said, “Each process for the numbers is very quick and short lived, but working in this way has taught me to be more efficient and focused.”  Dillon is a member of the cast and is portraying the titular role of Lizzie Borden. 
Students can find information on “Lizzie the Musical”, and all future PTC productions, through their Instagram @liuposttheatrecompany.

A new faculty member has created quite a buzz within the arts community at Post this Fall.  Hannah Ryan joined the Post theatre department in fall 2020 and has brought a lot of experience and knowledge to the department. She has worked on many Broadway productions including  “Hamilton” and “An American in Paris.” 
Ryan has worked as the Resident Director of Hamilton on Broadway since 2016, “I feel like I won the lottery every day I get to work on Hamilton,” said Ryan.  “It’s such a complex show and I continue to make discoveries and draw connections”
Ryan has not only worked on “Hamilton,” but a handful of other successful Broadway productions.
“As a resident, associate, and assistant, I’ve worked on 5 Broadway shows.  A couple highlights from that list would have to be “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime” and “An American in Paris”.”
She works extremely hard at her craft and makes sure her cast is feeling those same connections she does.
Ryan said, “making the experience personal for each actor is truly thrilling.”
Amidst COVID-19, Broadway has been shut down for months. “I wish I could still be working and directing new cast members that would have already joined the show by this point.  I miss the excitement of live theatre, of people gathered together creating a shared energy, and I can’t wait to get back.”Ryan said.

Ryan also maintains a freelance career, in which she develops and directs new works.  She said she could have about 8-10 projects on her plate at a time. This newest project is something the Post Theatre Company (PTC) is excited to see and learn more about.
“I am currently in the rehearsal process of ‘ROE’ by Lisa Loomer.”  A play discussing the topic of Roe Vs Wade.
The choice of this play is one of the main reasons Ryan came to direct at Post.
“The theatre community is a small one and I heard about the opportunity from another director and applied.  When I saw that one of the prospective plays was “ROE”, I was super excited about the possibility of sinking my teeth into this incredibly timely piece.”Ryan said. 
Ryan seems to be enjoying her time here at Post, and her time with PTC.
“I am loving every moment.  The cast is incredible, so devoted, so knowledgeable and so open, the designers inspiring, the staff supportive, and my stage manager goes above and beyond every single day.” Ryan said.
The people she works with feel the same way about her.  Quinn Doyle, a Sophomore BFA musical theatre major, has really loved working with Ryan.
“My experience working with Hannah so far has been wonderful.  She is an incredibly insightful woman with bold ideas and an open mind that never gets tired of retaining new information.  She’s so interested in hearing what we have to bring to the table.” Doyle said,
Doyle believes Ryan was the perfect fit for this production
“One word to describe Hannah Ryan: courageous.  She chose to direct a play that discusses an extremely controversial topic from past and present generations, that crosses disputes between religion, and politics in America.  I don’t think anyone is more fit than Hannah Ryan to take on such a responsibility during these uncertain times.” Doyle said. 
Hannah and her cast have such a loving, healthy, and strong relationship.  She said working with this cast is a dream.
“I had no prior knowledge of this program so I came in not knowing what to expect.  The cast has been  here for it and then some.”
Ryan is so excited by the challenge of directing and telling this polarized story with empathy reflected on both sides.  She hopes everyone will tune in to see what amazing work she, her cast, and her creative team has done.
“Get ready for an exciting live stream in early November.  We’re looking forward to sharing our journey of making theatre during a global pandemic fresh and approachable.”
For any students interested in viewing “ROE,” or any PTC production, information will be available in the Theatre Film building on the bulletin board, the Little Theatre box office, and the Post Theatre Company Instagram page, @liuposttheatrecompany.

October marks the beginning of LGBTQ+ History Month, a time dedicated to commemorating the contributions this marginalized group has made to history, and memorializing the struggle they’ve faced, and continue to face today. The United States began recognizing LGBTQ+ History Month in 1994, as it coincides with National Coming Out Day on Oct. 11, and it commemorates the October 1979 and 1987 LGBTQ+ Marches on Washington.
In observance of LGBTQ+ History Month, Rainbow Alliance and Promise have put together a series of events to celebrate and uplift the queer community on campus. “Promise hopes to provide the Post community with memorable, engaging and inclusive events and programming throughout October,” Anthony White, a success coach who’s been working with Rainbow Alliance to coordinate events throughout the month, said. “But more important is continuing our awareness for LGBTQ+ rights and equality for all peoples.”  
The month began with a virtual discussion with LGBT Network Vice President Robert Virtelli on Oct. 1. If students missed out on this event however, there’s still plenty to come throughout the rest of October. 
“Coming up we also have our video series “We’re Still Coming Out,” where people who want to can submit videos of their own coming out stories,” Nicole Ludwig, a senior psychology major, and the president of Rainbow Alliance, said. “Finally, we have our LGBTQ+ identity mixer on the 15, the screening of the movie “Milk” (also on the 15), and of the movie “Moonlight” on the 22.” All events are listed on Experience Shark Nation, as well as the Rainbow Alliance instagram page @liupostrainbowalliance and the Promise instagram page @postliupromise. 
In hosting these events, Rainbow Alliance hopes to continue to develop Post as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ Community. “One of our largest communities on campus are our LGBTQ+ individuals. It is important that all people, including those within the LGBTQ community, feel respected, safe, and welcomed while immersed in the Post community,” White said. 
Ludwig echoed White’s hopes for what the events of October might do for Post’s LGBTQ+ Community. “We hope to do two things: to educate, and to create a safe space for LGBTQ+ students and faculty. These two go hand in hand, as education promotes a safe space, and a safe space promotes education and learning,” she said.
Even if students aren’t able to attend the events Promise and Rainbow Alliance are hosting, there are other ways they can observe LGBTQ+ History Month. As a marginalized group, LGBTQ+ voices are often left out of historical narratives. “It’s crucial to question who wrote what you are reading, and whose experiences the text is focusing on,” Ludwig said. “If your textbooks and sources are all written by white men that are cisgender and heterosexual, then you might not be getting every side of the story, even if the authors had no intention of leaving anybody out or of having any kind of bias.” 
Though LGBTQ+ History Month allows the queer community to fondly reflect on how far they’ve come in the struggle for LGBTQ+ Rights, October also functions as an important reminder of how much work still needs to be done, especially in today’s political climate. 
“The Trump administration has attacked LGBTQ+ rights continuously, a lot of which have been targeted towards the trans community,” Ludwig said. “It’s important because LGBT+ rights are human rights. To deny us of our right to be ourselves and to be protected under federal law is dehumanizing and cruel. Inequality kills.” 
Students looking to become more involved in the LGBTQ+ Community on campus can attend any of the events being hosted this month, and as always, the Rainbow Alliance continues to create safe spaces for any and all members of the queer community here at Post. 
“For some people, college is the first time people can be out or even question or explore their sexuality or gender identity,” Ludwig said. “Rainbow Alliance is supposed to serve as a space where, no matter what your situation is outside of said space, you can feel safe, supported, and have some fun with people who support you.”

    The Nutrition Club is hosting virtual yoga classes for students to participate in to stay active. The classes will be held on Zoom, so all that is required is a mat and a five-dollar donation. The club is using this as a way to raise money for a food pantry in Glen Cove. Kelsey Bognar, senior nutrition and dietetics major and President of the Nutrition Club, said that the club needed to get creative in order to host events that comply with the current social distancing guidelines.  
“Since COVID has affected a lot of the events we were planning on holding with our members this semester, we had to get creative about what we could still do as a club and how we could also fundraise,” Bognar said. “We thought a virtual yoga class was perfect because it’s an activity we could virtually do all together as a group and simultaneously raise some money for a great cause.” The donations will go towards healthy food options to be dropped off at the pantry. 
    The yoga classes are a great way for students to participate and take a break from the busy academic schedule. “What I enjoyed most about the class is that it forced me to slow down and take a moment for myself, especially during these crazy and stressful times it’s definitely necessary. I felt very centered, calm, and relaxed once the class was over,” Bognar said. 
Students can often get overwhelmed with work and don’t take the necessary time to focus on themselves. “This falls in line with creating healthy daily habits by incorporating some physical activity to help support our health and overall well-being,” Suzette Negron, a junior nutrition and dietetics major, said. “This is an area that we can often neglect especially as students.” 
    The next yoga class will be on Oct. 17 at 10 a.m. to continue the fundraiser. The club will be having similar events and two Zumba classes in November and choose another organization to fundraise for. Nutrition Club members have been encouraged to invite family, friends and anyone who may be interested. To learn more about these events and the club, you can follow them on Instagram @liupostnutritionclub and email at post-nutritionclub@my.liu.edu.

On Sept. 26, New York state had 1000 reported COVID-19 cases for the first time since June. For the past 14 days, case numbers in NY have increased at a +30 rate, leaving reason for New Yorkers to discuss what needs to be done to keep cases under control and battle COVID-19. 
“I think that as schools began to reopen it was inevitable that there would be a spike in cases. As people returned to school, work, etc, there has been an increase in contact with others and therefore an increase in COVID cases,” Caitlyn Gallagher, a junior health science major, said. “I am glad, however, to see that the spike has been minor and able to be maintained.”
Some students, such as freshman health science major Catherine Robles, fear that increased regulations may be required if the number of cases keeps increasing.
“If we go back too soon we cause a bigger spread and worse case have to go back to phase one where we will be in quarantine once again,” Robles said. “It’s safer than how we’re back in February but we still need to take the extra precaution to stay as safe as we can to keep ourselves healthy and others who are at more of a risk. With more testing for a cure and doing all the safety measures we won’t be having another breakout episode as some other countries like Italy.”
Other students feel differently. “It’s kind of frustrating in a way. I can only speak for myself but I’m doing everything I can to protect the spread of COVID-19 for myself and for others,” Amanda Masullo, a senior nursing major, said. “We all want things to go back to normal, but who knows if we will ever get that sense of normalcy back if we aren’t trying our hardest to follow rules that will benefit us all. I know that COVID-19, especially at its peak, really did a lot of damage to people’s mental health, especially healthcare providers so to see the numbers start increasing again and seeing how COVID has unfolded once before, it is definitely scary and unpredictable.”     
While Gallagher believes that the university has been doing a good job in regards to COVID-19 protocols, she stresses that all students need to continue following regulations for the safety of the campus community. 
“The university has been able to isolate and effectively manage the few positive cases that we have had on campus. That being said, I believe it is necessary to continue taking all precautions and maintain all health and safety guidelines. These numbers must be closely monitored to prevent a second outbreak,” Gallagher said. 
“I think the university is actually taking good precautions to protect against COVID. I’ve never felt unsafe while at the school, there’s hand sanitizer everywhere. I’ve never seen anyone without a mask on and every desk I’ve ever sat at was more than socially distant from the one next to me,” Masullo said. “If we keep taking these precautions I’m confident that we could be here till Christmas break, however if New York’s numbers keep increasing, I don’t think I could say the same thing. Especially because our school is a big commuter school and we don’t know how safe and cautious people are when they aren’t at school, so that’s also something to think about.” 
Masullo has seen things from a hands on, clinical perspective. “I can say that although our numbers have decreased at least from the beginning of this all doesn’t mean that we should stop being safe when it comes to taking precautions,” she said. I’ve seen how hard these nurses and staff work to keep their patients safe now I can only imagine their experiences working in the healthcare field when covid was at its peak.”
Gallagher believes that the university should continue to provide information about COVID-19 cases on campus as they have been. “I believe that the university should continue to provide updates on our specific situation in regards to the covid outbreak. Faculty must continue to openly communicate with students about health & safety protocols, preventative measures and positive cases in our community.”

Teachers and professors throughout the Long Island school systems have been facing a multitude of newfound hurdles as they attempt to adapt their teachings to meet precautions that have been set in place upon the arrival of the COVID-19 virus and the challenges brought with it. As we begin a new semester, teachers have begun to acclimate themselves in their adjusted classrooms. 
 As expected, the recent changes have not gone over well with many educators’ across New York State. Upon the commencement of the fall 2020 school year, many educators across the state have reported similar difficulties that they have encountered when it comes to facilitating their lectures, and doing their job as they normally would. 
Normal feels like yesterday for some professors and teachers, and many of them dream to return to a school system in which COVID-19 ceases to debilitate their teaching procedures. Each school district across New York State faces its own set of individualized hurdles. Factors such as funding, well-trained teachers, educational resources, as well as proper care and consideration for the circumstances given, vary greatly between schools. 
School districts with less financial resources and poorly trained teachers are facing much larger challenges than students who have been fortunate enough to be provided with laptops at the school district’s expense. Each district faces its own challenges, and continues to define their own version of normal.
Plainedge High School mathematics teacher Andrea Lupo explained her district’s immediate problems, as they have been encountering an unforeseen number of problems, during this school year. “The worst transition I’ve ever experienced in 21 years of teaching,” said Lupo. “The building itself was a mess and the whole gymnasium was filled with our file cabinets, our desks and materials and we had to go find them from the pile.” 
“The technology was not working or ready in working order for us to do our jobs, and we’re still working out the kinks,” Lupo said. There was confusion surrounding the chromebooks that were given to students. Some students’ chromebooks allowed for touch screen controls, while others didn’t have this functionality. Students encountered several problems at home, including internet connection issues, as well as their chromebooks not functioning properly. 
In tandem with the continued stress that the global pandemic has provided for people, it’s no surprise that educators all over the state are continuing to face new difficulties within their occupations.
Seaford Middle School biology teacher Micheal Shaqatano had similar comments regarding his transition into the fall 2020 school year. Shaqatano said that the school year “is very, very challenging and difficult, and you’re kinda thrown into it, and figuring things out as you go along.” There have been an immense amount of changes when it comes to the science department, and it’s facilitation of laboratory activities and projects. Students have shifted classrooms, and are not studying and using the laboratory classrooms. “We need access to water, and now we’re in a regular classroom, and any water I need has to be wheeled in on a cart that’s in a beaker.”
The laboratory classrooms are currently being used for students special testing requirements. “We spend the first fifteen to twenty minutes troubleshooting problems that each of the students have with their chromebooks,” Shaqatano said. This school year has provided no shortage of problems and hiccups for educators as they simply continue and try their best to get by these next few semesters. 
When asked about his experience, professor of film Michael Atkinson said “Mostly, it’s like trying to teach with an asbestos suit on – but I’m adapting, as you must, and stubbornly refusing to give the masks, barriers, distancing and Zooming a priority in my head or in the classroom. Everybody must try a little harder, including the students, and so far that’s what I see happening.”

President Donald Trump will not commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he does not win the upcoming election. He told CNN reporter Brian Karem that “[mail-in] ballots are a disaster”. The president went on to say that removing the ballots will ensure a peaceful transfer, or continuation, of the presidency. 
Following his daily press conference on Sept. 23, Trump was asked if he would peacefully transfer power again.
“We want to make sure the election is honest and I’m not sure that it can be,” Trump said. “I don’t know that it can be with this whole situation, unsolicited ballots.” 
Kayleigh McEnany, White House press secretary, later said that Trump will accept the outcome of the election if he considers it free and fair. This criteria can be satisfied by the ridding of mass, mail-out voting, she continues.
It is likely that if Trump loses the election in November to his opposing candidate Joe Biden, the matter of whether or not mail-in ballots were valid in the election will be taken to the Supreme Court. Following the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the potential subsequent power shift in favor of a conservative majority in the court, Trump will most likely have the court in his favor.
Political science professor Dr. Michael Soupios, believes Trump is trying to justify continuation of his presidency even if he loses by refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. “For anybody, given our traditions and history, anybody in that position in particular, to even allude to something along those lines is a travesty,” Soupios said. “It’s a veiled threat, and again that’s what I say is outrageous: that any American president would even hint at something like that.”
Should the incumbent lose the election, Dr. Soupios predicts an abrupt erosion of loyalty within the party. “As long as he sits in the oval office, he can count on the loyalty and support of the Republicans, and I mean by that inside of the government as well as his voting base. The voting base, in my opinion, remains loyal no matter what,” said Dr. Soupios, “and the guys inside of the party, the members of Congress who are, for example, Republicans, are pusillanimous. They’re cowardly – these guys will support Donald Trump down the line … until he loses the election.” 
Dr. Soupios believes that Trump is consciously loading the Supreme Court with members loyal to the Republican party to further his agenda. “The U.S. Justice Department is up for grabs, and I think he’s also going out of his way to radically politicize the court system,” said Dr. Soupios. “He’s put 200 very conservative judges on the bench, he and [Republican Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell. I don’t know enough about [Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett], I know she’s conservative, but the one that’s going to be replacing Ginsburg. She’s obviously very conservative; whether or not she has integrity, it’s one thing to be conservative – there’s nothing wrong with having conservative viewpoints as long as you don’t insert them ideologically into the legal interpretation of who and what you are as a judge.” 
Despite the substantial presence of those loyal to President Trump, a unanimous commitment to a peaceful transition was reached in the Senate.
Dr. Soupios believes that Trump’s gripes with the mail-in ballot system stem from a motivation to manipulate.
“It’s more smoke and mirrors; what [President Trump will] do is if they lose the election they’ll say ‘well, it wasn’t fair and square, the mail ballots were a mechanism on the part of our opponents to steal the election away from us.’ If you stop and look at the data, there are five or six states that have always done mail balloting, and in terms of fraud and manipulation, statistically speaking, there is virtually zero problem. It’s all manufactured on the part of Donald Trump, and will serve, potentially, as a pretext to argue that he had the election stolen from under him,” said Dr. Soupios. “Most academic people tend to be left. I think the vast majority of people in the [education] profession, if they were polled, would argue that there’s nothing to indicate large-scale fraud or manipulation based on the use or non-use of these ballots.”
“Remember,” he said. “There’s very good reason for the increase of mail-in, because we’re in the middle of a pandemic. People don’t want to be congregating in a polling place or waiting on line on top of one another, and God forbid you get sick, And people have the right to be concerned about that.”
While many people oppose the need for Trump to bring the Supreme Court into the controversy of mail-in ballots, others trust Trump and his administration.
“I believe that Trump will not peacefully leave the office because of the illegitimacy of mail-in ballots. A lot of people say it’s Trump making up lies, but a quote from a New York Post article regarding this subject says, ‘A top Democratic operative says voter fraud, especially with mail-in ballots, is no myth. And he knows this because he’s been doing it, on a grand scale, for decades,’”sophomore marketing major Jacob Shamah said. “In all honesty, I don’t know what the implications [of not committing to a peaceful transfer of power] will be, but I do think if there is no peaceful transfer of power, it is for the right reasons. If the fraud is fixed in the mail-in ballot system, then I believe he will gladly leave office.”
Shamah believes that if the fraudulency of mail-in ballots is not addressed, Trump will not win the election. “Even though I am a Trump supporter, I have a diverse friend group,” Shamah said. “Because of this, many of the people are reacting in different ways. My right wing friends are reacting as I am. They believe what I’ve been saying throughout the entire interview so far, but my left wing friends believe it is a hoax to help his campaign when there are cases of mail-in ballot fraud happening before us.”
Donald Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power can impact the election results on Nov. 3.

Simon Sheppard’s book “Roman Soldier vs Parthian Warrior: Carrhae to Nisibis” earned the number one spot on the Amazon New Release list. Sheppard is a political science professor at LIU Brooklyn and earned his Ph.D at Johns Hopkins University. 
Sheppard was inspired to write this book because of its relevance to the study of geopolitics in the classes he teaches. “The battle of Carrhae was the first time another culture had gone toe-to-toe with the Romans and not just beaten them but established a frontier they could not successfully cross,” he said. “The Romans had annihilated or forcibly assimilated every other people they had encountered up until that point, from the Carthaginians to the Greeks, so it was first shocking and then frustrating for them that they could never seal the deal against the Parthians. This was because the Parthians had mastered what I call the three “Ts” – terrain (the flat, open country of the region), technology (the deadly composite bow), and tactics (horse-archers who wouldn’t stand still to be pinned down but instead would ride around the foot-slogging Roman legions and shoot them to pieces from a safe distance.”
Sheppard believes that it is important to have some personal experience of the historical locations he describes.
 “I like to travel, and will tour the sites of the sieges and battles that I am describing to get a feel for the terrain, climate, and other features,”he said.
Sheppard has a one-year period in which to complete research, prepare the manuscript, and write the book. Within the year, he needs to draw up maps, find appropriate illustrations, and work with an artist in sketching original artwork. 
Sheppard’s publishing company Osprey is on the #1 spot on the Amazon New Release list frequently, “it has been a very meaningful partnership. I was very pleased to be rated #1 in the categories relating to the subject,” Sheppard said. 
Sheppard recommends his book to any students who are interested in the history of Rome, the Middle East, geopolitics, or warfare. 
As for future plans, Sheppard is working on more books, “I am wrapping up two more books this December – one on the Spanish Conquistadors and the Inca in the 16th Century, the other on the Viking siege of Paris in 885-886. In March next year, I will submit a book on the American War of Independence as a civil war – the Patriots vs. the Loyalists. In August, I submitted a book on the ANZACs vs. the Ottoman Turkish Army during the First World War. Those titles are all for Osprey. And I have a December 2021 deadline to submit a monograph on America’s1928 Presidential Election to the University Press of Kansas. I have other proposals under consideration, so I am always busy.”

The Pillars of Excellence program has replaced the five-star requirements for student organizations in light of student feedback.
Associate Director of Greek Life and Student Involvement Jessica Rappaport said that the new program features many changes from the original five-star requirements.
“The pillars are very different,” she said. “Instead of [earning stars], a group can achieve three different pillars, blue, silver and gold. We also no longer use the size of an organization to measure achievement, we only ask that groups have a minimum of ten members.” 
The purpose of the Pillars of Excellence program is to support student organizations in achieving institutional standards that cultivate a community of belonging for students. Pillars of Excellence provides structure for baseline expectations and requirements of a recognized student organization and provides opportunities and benefits for aspirational growth. Groups can achieve each of the pillars based on their performance in the three qualifying categories; administrative, attendance, and campus engagement. 
There are a multitude of benefits for student organizations able to achieve one of these pillars. 
A blue pillar organization meets the expectations of a student organization and is thus privy to all of the rights and benefits of a recognized organization. 
A silver pillar organization exceeds the expectations of a recognized organization. On top of the benefits a blue organization would receive, silver pillar members have the ability to request usage of storage space, priority placement for fall and spring involvement fairs, recognition at the spring student leadership awards and additional $250 of allocated funds for the next academic year. 
A gold pillar organization exemplifies the expectations of a recognized organization. They receive all of the previously mentioned benefits as well as an organization spotlight on the Promise website, a private end of year event, and $500 total allocated funds. 
 President of the Fashion Merchandising club Anna Serro believes the Pillars program will benefit clubs. 
“I definitely think the Pillars of Excellence are much more manageable than the five star program,” Serro said. “It gives the clubs enough independence to do what they want while still having requirements for the campus.”
Serro also enjoys the collaboration between clubs that the Pillars promote.
“I like how we are encouraged to work with other organizations on campus as well,” she said. “It will be tough this year to achieve a gold pillar status just because we are limited to mostly online events and club meetings and are not allowed to hold off campus events, but in a non-Covid environment I think the pillars will benefit most clubs.” 
Administration is using student feedback to continuously improve the Pillars of Excellence and club certification requirements.

The instagram account @liupost began creating and sharing posts to promote social distancing and wearing masks two weeks after classes began 
The Instagramposts remind students to follow social distancing guidelines, frequently wash their hands, wear masks in public spaces, and to take the COVID-19 self check daily. Other posts show photos of students, like junior finance major and resident assistant Orion Nokes, wearing Long Island University Sharks masks. On each photo it reads “As members of our community we pledge to respect ourselves. Respect each other. Respect shark nation.” The caption on each photo also reads “Fins Up, Mask Up” next to a shark emoji. 
Although the instagram posts are a good reminder of the school’s coronavirus policy on campus, Nokes believe they might not remind students to actually follow the guidelines the way the posts intended. 
“It’s been so long in quarantine,” Nokes said. “A lot of people have already made their decisions on how much they want to care about wearing their masks.”  
Sophomore psychology major Savannah Fowler says she has witnessed students’ decisions firsthand at her on campus job as a Starbucks barista. “Lots of people don’t cover their nose,” she said. In order to properly wear a mask to protect against the spread of COVID-19, both the nose and mouth must be covered at all times. 
Despite these Instagram reminders, some students are concerned about the overall safety of the classrooms. Senior film major Jason Harris is completing this semester remotely because of his concerns. His major worries include a lack of social distancing and not disinfecting classrooms in between classes. 
While professors are expected to enforce social distance guidelines in their own classrooms, rooms like the one pictured above, may not have the space capable for social distancing, or the classes may have too many students to properly stay six feet apart.
“Posting about social distancing, but not actually following it, comes off as fake,” senior journalism major James Bonner said. “It endangers people who have business there.” 
As of Oct. 4, there are two reported positive cases of the coronavirus on the Post campus and three reported cases on the Brooklyn campus.

The Black Student Union (BSU) held an online forum discussing the recent verdict for the three officers responsible for the murder of Breonna Taylor on Sept. 29. The meeting took place via Zoom and was open to those who wanted to speak up, share or learn about the Breonna Taylor case. 
Breonna Taylor was killed by Louisville Police officers on March 13. Since her death, the nation has demanded justice for Taylor. Recent developments have shown that the three officers, Officers Brett Hankinson, Jon Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, entered her house with a no-knock warrant while Breonna Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were asleep. Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, fired out of fear, mistaking the officers for intruders. The officers then fired a total of 32 shots in return. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was struck around eight times, killing her. 
Only one officer was terminated and indicted for “wanton endangerment.” According to Kentucky law, wanton endangerment is “in the first degree when, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, he wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person.” Instead of directly being charged for the death of Taylor, the former detective was charged for a crime that resulted in less punishment, leading the nation to resume their fight for justice for Taylor. 
The BSU highlighted their Union as a space of cultural diversity for people of color, and a space created for support, safety and to celebrate the color of one’s skin in a world where individuals are judged by such arbitrary factors. The forum that the BSU created was filled with the emotions that current students felt regarding the Taylor incident and verdict hearing. A sounding note of the organization was the feeling of unity resonating between members through the Zoom meeting.
Amanda McCollum, headliner and host of the discussion, spoke out against the verdict of the officers and their actions that took a Black woman’s life.  
“If the prosecutor had properly presented the evidence in this case and shown the intent of the officers, I have no doubt the jury would have given out indictments. I honestly do not believe the problems lie with the jury; I believe the issue was with Attorney General Daniel Cameron who was the prosecutor who presented to the Grand Jury,” McCollum said. “Although a Black man, AG Cameron, works within a system that has historically been used against Black people,  his Blackness does not make him an ally to Breonna or her family. This is a misconception that I think was very widespread.  Black people put their faith and trust in a Black man who holds a position able to cause real change and enact justice for people who deserve it, that does not all mean he wanted justice for her or cared about her case or story.  These men took an innocent woman’s life.  Punishment is deserved and if the system was fair and just, punishment would have been given.” 
BSU club members and call participants expressed feelings of hurt, confusion and betrayal from the United States government and police force. During the discussion, Aniyah Brown, junior and communications major, presented her opinions of the current problem of increasing police brutality in America. “The police system itself was built on systemic racism. Their origins were for slave patrol. The system works for who it was made for and that is mainly, rich white men.  The system itself presents the origins of privilege.” 
Samantha Winters, a junior art major, followed up with a message to allies of POC nationwide, “If you are a non-Person of Color and you recognize your privilege and do not use it for the good of everybody, then you are the problem as well,” she said. “ You are contributing to the systemic oppression that is suppressing or Black and brown brothers and sisters. That is something that cannot be forgiven until you begin to make the change within yourself.” 
Later on in the night McCollum shared her views on how the police have gained and maintained their power. “Like all public servants, police are given their power by the people. In theory, we entrust these few to protect us, provide us with comfort and a safe environment and in exchange we bestow upon them authority to conduct themselves in a way that would allow them to do these things. However, we know that these protections, historically, have only been afforded to a select group of people. This group has given police license to abuse everyone who does not fall into their strict societal category. This is where I believe this abuse stems and starts from,” she said. 
More feelings of anger towards the judicial and news outlets arose when students began reciting articles in an attempt to justify breaking and entering into Taylor’s home and killing her. Many articles attempted to convey the same narrative, trying to prove that because her boyfriend is an alleged drug lord, he is the reason why her home could have been broken into. Students at the meeting cited the media’s attempt to justify unlawful entry and blatant ignorance for human life by painting a picture of drug possession and selling in Breonna’s home with no evidence. 
The BSU students and Zoom attendees agreed that there is a current theme of discrediting Black African Americans to justify murder. The group also agreed that in the U.S., there is a social belief system that connects the skin of people of color to criminality and violence, that police officers embrace this mentality in order to justify their actions and that their followers appeal to this mentality when criticizing punitive action against them. 
It is especially damaging knowing that not only was an innocent Black woman killed in her home while she slept, but that people within the media and Louisville Police tried to smear her image in order to justify and validate her murder.  
“The idea of an innocent woman not only being murdered by those sworn to protect her but also being judged and vilified for things not pertinent to the case only adds insult to injury. Breonna’s case and Breonna herself, like all others, will never be forgotten, their names are more than hashtags and the Grand Jury’s decision will only cause more unrest in my opinion,” McCollum said. “No Justice, No Peace.”

The NBA Finals began Wednesday, Sept. 30, with the Lakers defeating the Miami Heat 116 to 98.  The fact that the Finals will be played at all is a major feat for a league  that floated the idea of canceling the rest of the postponed NBA season entirely during the spring. At the time, team owners’ concerns over liability issues factored into discussions, according to CNBC, though ultimately, the threats of over a $1 billion loss in revenue proved too much to overcome. This publicity and the financial necessity to finish the season led to the bubble plan; play resumed with scrimmages on July 22 after a hiatus beginning on March 11.
Viewership has fallen from previous seasons, with several factors potentially contributing. Never before has the NBA played games late into the summer, a season during which TV viewership lags significantly behind spring ratings, according to Forbes. Additionally, the league’s hyperfocus on tackling social justice issues likely contributed to the dropoff in TV ratings over previous years. Eddie McQuade, a senior sports management major watched some of the NBA’s restart and was very pleased with the NBA’s response to calls for social justice.  “I think the players taking a stand by boycotting games for Jacob Blake and wearing ‘Black Lives Matter’ on their backs is a great way to show that we’re trying to make a change in the world,” he said. Despite initially being wary of kneeling during the national anthem, McQuade adds that he understands the message the players are trying to convey and does not have an issue with the athletes “standing up for what they believe in.”
    He adds that some of the games felt like “glorified scrimmages” without fans in the bubble environment, a sentiment commonly shared among viewers.  Like many, McQuade was skeptical of the NBA’s ability to prevent players and staff from contracting COVID-19 and finishing out the season. With the season nearly at its conclusion, Mcquade appreciates the way the NBA was able to finish the season during the current health crisis. “I give commissioner Adam Silver a lot of credit for somehow making the bubble in Orlando work, despite Florida being a hot spot for the virus at the time,” he said. McQuade adds that he would not have an issue with returning  to a bubble environment to begin next season if infection rates spike once again.
