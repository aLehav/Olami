While Post Theatre Company consists of approximately 180 students, their rehearsal and class facilities are comprised of renovated horse stables that cannot sustain the growing program.
David Hugo, director of the musical theatre program, attended a budget and finance meeting in New York City over winter break. “I was there as part of the faculty senate and was introduced by President Cline to Joseph Schaffer so that he and I could make a future meeting to talk about making a plan to fix the facility in the future,” Hugo said.
Maria Porter, the director of the acting program, and Hugo awaited a phone call from Schaffer to schedule a meeting on campus. When Schaffer called, he asked Hugo why Post’s theatre students were commenting about the conditions of their facilities on Instagram.
Many of the comments emphasized the lack of space in the theatre, film and dance building, where there are only four rooms for the students to use for both their classes and production rehearsals.
Hugo checked Instagram and looked at student comments on Cline’s post of congratulations to the company for ranking top 30 in the nation by Onstage Blog.
Over 50 people, many of whom are part of the theatre company, commented under the post, and even reposted it, claiming that Cline does not support the theatre program.Cline’s post was deleted later, but the @liupost Instagram account still has a post recognizing the company’s achievement.
The comments under the post primarily consisted of statements claiming that the facilities are too small and unsafe, and that the administration is doing nothing to resolve the issue.
“I was shocked because of the way people were speaking so personally and looking negatively at our department,” Kamerann Burney, a freshman musical theatre major, said. “I don’t want comments to negatively affect our department.”
Hugo addressed the situation with his students at the beginning of this semester.
“He thanked us for our honesty and our opinion and for being brave and speaking out because that’s what artists do, push boundaries,” Burney said.
“They [the theatre staff] were very proud of us and they said, ‘just in the future, if we do something like that to be as positive as we can,’” she said. What we didn’t know is that change is happening. We were frustrated over information we didn’t have.”
Hugo believes that the theatre students were wary because plans for the development of the program have and will continue to take time. He also urged his students to refrain from restoring to social media until they have made the efforts to meet with senior administration about their concerns.
“I think that the school is making the necessary moves to give us [the theatre company] the space we need,” Hugo said. Hugo had no comment on the specific changes the theatre program will receive next year because plans are still being developed.
“Our commitment to the musical theatre program is steadfast,” Cline said. “The university has supported the program by increasing scholarship funding, supporting faculty travel for national recruitment and securing a multi-million dollar gift to renovate Krasnoff Theater, which is currently used as a venue by the musical theatre program.”
Further plans for the program facilities will be addressed in the 2020 master plan. The release date for this plan is still in flux.
Ed Weis, the vice president of academic affairs, held a meeting with some of the theatre students to discuss their concerns and help find solutions.
“This can serve as a teachable moment for us all that direct dialogue is the most effective way to address issues,” Weis said.
When the renovations and space are ready for the program, Hugo knows the department will enjoy the changes. Until then, the program will continue to use the facilities as they have before, with more in-person communication rather than on social media.
“Patience and being positive is really important so we can keep growing and keep producing working talent,” Hugo said.
Although the theatre company underwent a miscommunication with the faculty over the administration’s support for the program, students are hopeful that developments will be made to accommodate one of the largest programs on campus.

Excellent article. One mustn’t just fall prey to the logical fallacy of appeals to tradition. People communicate in a myriad of ways to affect change and there’s more than one way to get your message across. I encourage the students and the administration to creatively work together with the local, state and national community in seeking out additional funding through donations, grants, fundraisers, etc.. I also encourage the students to honestly boast of their program wherever possible in order to help draw positive attention to attract such funds and to help the program and the students move forward.

Students returning to campus from winter recess have recognized a significant change in the campus’ scenery. Several trees were cut down along Chipmunk Trail, a pathway formerly known for its lush forestry and abundance of little animals.
But Chipmunk Trail isn’t the only place affected by the recent deforestation. Areas surrounding the Winnick House and Brick Rose Arbor arches have also suffered loss of trees.
While some are unaffected by the change in scenery, others have found the change tobe quite upsetting. Elissa Roose, a sophomore international relations major, had a lot to say about the trees and how she felt about their vanishing. “I’m not a fan of it. Not only did it take away from the whole aesthetic of Chipmunk Trail, but it puts nothing but negative effects on the environment,” she said.
Roose also mentioned that the trees offered more to campus than just beauty. “I know there were a lot of signs that pointed out what kind of trees there were and there was a lot of education behind it too,” she said.

To some students, the trees were nothing more than a part of their daily commute;however, the bareness left behind has sparked up a lot of conversation because not only will the students miss the trees, but the surrounding nature and wildlife will suffer as well. This was apparent to junior speech pathology major, Caitlin Rodriguez, who was quick to put the animals before herself.
“I’m upset with the tree cutting because it affects all of the animals living in those woods,” she said. “They don’t know anything different than those trees and now they’re gone.”
It’s unclear what the future of the now empty space will be. The Pioneer reached out to Roy Fergus, director of facilities services, who did not respond in time for comment.
Even if the trees weren’t a part of student life before, the lack of forestry now surroundingthe trail has resonated with most students on campus. Mary Harrell, sophomore musical theatre major, said she didn’t think much of the trees before they were cut down.
“They were just scenery, and I’m sorry to say that because I miss their presence,” she said.

Executive Dean of Students Michael Berthel sent out an email to students, familiesand staff on Monday, Jan. 27, informing everyone of recent news and information aboutthe 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The email included preventative measures and resources for students who may have recently traveled to Wuhan, China.
As of Feb. 2, 304 deadly cases of the Coronavirus have been reported in Wuhan, China where the illness originated. Eleven confirmed cases have been reported in the United States as of Feb. 3, but none have been reported in New York; however, a recent scare occurred in Nassau County.
One of the ten suspected cases in New York state involved a person who was “passing through” Nassau County, Newsday reported on Jan. 28. That individual tested negative for the virus. Health officials in both Nassau and Suffolk counties said there are no suspected Coronavirus cases in either county.
Katelyn Wagner, a freshman psychology major, was worried when she heard about ascare hitting too close to home.
“This was really scary to me, as I have family that live in Nassau, as well as my boyfriend. We also live in Nassau so I feared it would hit the campus and spread like crazy,” she said.
Berthel’s email addressed student concerns and informed the community of preventive measures and symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Student responses to the email were mixed.
“I feel like the email was unnecessary and was giving students a reason to make them panic,” Margaret Levin, a junior musical theatre major, said.
While the email had potential to make some panic, it helped Wagner understandthe severity of the situation.
“It’s important that everyone knows the symptoms and prevention of the virus. A college campus is also a place where germs spread like crazy so it is important to address it,” she said.
Faculty also felt the email was needed. Jamie Ross, professor of the business of fashion merchandising and sustainability, said the notice was very proactive.
“Again, I don’t think that we can just think that’s not going to impact us here and that we [should] take all precautionary measures as much as possible,” she said.
The Coronavirus has also raised concerns of racism and xenophobia because of its place of origin. Awareness toward the matter was raised through hashtags and posts on social media, including the hashtag, #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus, which is French and translates to “I am not a virus.”
“I am disgusted at the prejudice that has been going on as aftermath,” Levin said. “Thisisn’t a time for countries to be xenophobic toward the Chinese. I’m more concerned about the overt racism going on right now. It is very unlikely that I, a 20-year-old in the United States, will get it,” she said.
The University of California Berkeley recently posted a picture listing xenophobia as a“normal” reaction to the news of Coronavirus. When thinking about the university’s email, Levin said, “I wish the university had said something about the xenophobia and racism that is occuring because of the coronavirus.”
In addition to impacting our health and global compassion, the Coronavirus is alsolikely to affect the global economy. According to Ross, Americans shouldn’t assume that because they’re in the United States, the virus isn’t going to impact them.
“We need to think of China, and in terms of not only being their partners as people, but also in terms of business ramifications,” she said. “Pretty much all their businesses are shut down, many businesses, many factories. People are quarantined. They are home and this would be a key time of year in terms of sales, because it is the Chinese New Year.”
Berthel’s email assured students and staff that the school is in contact with the appropriate officials. They will continue to keep the campus community updated and will continue to follow any recommendations issued.

Fourteen students will have the opportunity to study abroad in Reykjavik, Iceland on May 21 for 10 days to complete a case study on Nordic societies with Brian Sweeney, associate professor of sociology.
Iceland is named the “Land of Fire and Ice” because it’s one of the hottest travel destinations in the world, while also consisting of breathtaking features such as mountains, geysers, glaciers and waterfalls.
The course is formally called Global Cultures: Iceland – The Social Foundations of Happiness and can be taken as the three credit course SOC 35 Sociology/Anthropology SOC 35, which is cross-listed as Honors SOC 360 and Political Science POL 10.
Iceland consistently ranks among the happiest nations in the world, and as of 2020 isfourth on the World Population Review’s ranking. The trip’s purpose is to explore the social foundations of well being in Nordic culture. The students’ mission is to figure out if Icelanders are as some people expect them to be – emotionally one with themselves.
During the trip, students will attend lectures and workshops with Icelandic social scientists who are experts on areas related to the Nordic society’s high levels of life expectancy, social cohesion, and political freedom and equality, according to Sweeney.
Students will also get free time to walk in completely safe areas to search and exploremuseums, historical sights and tours that will lead them behind waterfalls and up steep hills.“We’ll learn about government and politics, healthcare, the environment and education in Iceland,” Sweeney said. “We’ll even learn, for example, why Icelandic team sports consistently do well internationally, ‘punching above their weight,’ and outperforming teams from much larger countries.”
The entirety of the trip will be in daylight, including the nights. The sun sets around 11p.m. and rises around 3:45 a.m. In Iceland, the sun never drops far enough below the horizon for the sky to get dark.
“Even at 1 a.m., it’s pretty bright; similar to an overcast day on Long Island,” Sweeney said.
Iceland is beautiful and weird, according to Sweeney. As soon as you leave the airport, the landscape is unlike anything seen elsewhere.
“It’s like you’ve landed on the moon or another world. It does not disappoint,” he said.
Students pay for three credits of tuition with a 10 percent discount to study abroad,which is about $3,000. They are also responsible to pay anywhere from $550 to $750 forairfare, as well as a travel fee of about $1,300, which includes all transportation, hotels, tours and museums.
Students interested in this event can visit the course website at https://liuiceland.weebly.com/, which offers a detailed explanation for each component of the trip. Those who have questions or interest can email Sweeney at brian.sweeney@liu.edu or call him at (516) 229-2456.

The 62nd Grammy Awards, held at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles on Jan. 27, inspired many who watched, as singer, songwriter and performer Billie Eilish took home a record-breaking number of awards.
The annual show has celebrated talented musicians since 1959, ranking the year’s top artists in 30 fields (Pop, Gospel, Jazz, etc.) and 84 distinct award categories across those fields, including musical theater, spoken word, latin, R&B, and the most popular category, the general field.
There are four categories which make up the general field division: record of the year, album of the year, song of the year, and best new artist. Until recently only one artist, Christopher Cross, has won all four of these Grammys in one night back in 1981.
At the 2020 Grammy Awards show, Billie Eilish made history and walked away with five Grammys, including every Grammy in the general field and best pop vocal album. Eilish is the only woman to win all four categories in a single night, and the youngest person to win album of the year for her album “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” beating the previous placeholder, Taylor Swift, by two years.
Sofia Coppola, a sophomore film major, thinks Eilish’s success is amazing.
“To be eighteen, a young woman, and to have won five Grammys shows that anything is possible as long as you put your heart into something,” she said.
Eilish’s recent accomplishment has been an inspiration and a positive leading example to aspiring students. Her large influence on younger generations has led some to look up to Eilish as a musical icon of their times.
“I think Billie Eilish represents the beginning of a generation that are personally aware of their emotions and able to convey them in such a way so as to be understood,” Tyanna Middleton, a freshman music major, said.
With this historical moment in music, students expect nothing more than to continue the wave of breaking boundaries.
“I am beyond proud that she has done what she has and cannot wait to see whatshe’ll do in the future,” Middleton said.
