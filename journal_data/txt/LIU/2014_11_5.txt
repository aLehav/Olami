Democrat Andrew Cuomo has been re-elected for a second term as Governor of New York State on Tuesday, Nov. 4, after defeating Republican Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive. Despite the victor of the gubernatorial race in the 2014 Midterm Elections, the real question here is did students from LIU Post have an impact on the outcome?
The Pioneer asked 45 random students from New York State if they had voted, and the results reflected a general consensus that Post students are not interested in politics. Five students said they voted while 40 students said they did not.
“I think most students just don’t care about politics. They don’t realize that what happens in Albany and in Washington affects them, too,” said Jacob Schmotzer, sophomore English and Secondary Education major and the president of the College Republicans club on campus. “I think they’re throwing away not only a right, but a privilege, too. What really annoys me, though, is when people who don’t vote complain about politics.” Schmotzer was one of the five students who voted on Tuesday; he casted his ballot for Astorino.
Amal Zeidan, a first-year Nutrition graduate student, voted for Astorino as well. Zeidan explained that voting is something that people should take advantage of. “It’s crucial because it gives us a chance to take back the senate,” she said. Zeidan also feels that students do not vote because they feel their vote doesn’t matter, and “because this is most likely their first election, they are not interested in politics or the election process in general. Many are also unaware of [where to vote], [and] if they’re registered. [Also, if voters] don’t know the issues or the candidates, they won’t vote because they are uninformed.” Zeidan feels students are throwing away their political voices. “Voting is a beautiful privilege in this country and too many people take it for granted,” she said.
According to the New York Times, Astorino struggled to raise campaign money, as well as his political profile to the people, which explains his shortcomings in this year’s Midterm Elections. Tuesday’s victory makes Gov. Cuomo New York’s first Democratic governor to be re-elected since his father, Mario Cuomo.

Canrock Ventures, the four- year-old early stage technology venture capital corporation that moved on to campus during Thanksgiving weekend 2013, failed to notify New York State officials of potential conflicts of interest. The company invested taxpayer money in local technology start- ups, according to a representative at Empire State Development (ESD), New York’s chief economic development agency.
The Pioneer reported on April 23, 2014, that Canrock was being reviewed by the United States Department of Treasury and (ESD) because they failed to inform New York State officials that they invested federal money into companies they owned a portion of. The investigation began in November 2013, and is ongoing. Canrock Ventures received $5.7 million in 2012 from New York State as part of the Innovate NY Fund, which was created in 2011, and invests in technology start-ups through venture capital firms based in New York State.
Canrock Ventures received the funds so it could invest in technology startups on Long Island and in New York City. The four companies that Canrock Ventures invested in are all partially owned by the company, and are located at their LIU Post offices, according to a Newsday article published on Oct. 15, 2014. The article “Canrock Ventures didn’t report potential conflicts in LI tech investments, officials say” was written by James Madore. According to the article, Canrock Ventures has put nearly $2 million of Innovate NY funds into five startups where it is either the largest shareholder or owns a significant stake.
“We are looking into potential conflicts of interest with the company and certain investments they made within the company,” said Jason Conwall, Press Secretary for ESD. “There is a serious review [being conducted] of investments, the involvement of Mark Fasciano, and Canrock Ventures overall, and how much of an ownership stake Fasciano has in the companies that the investments went to,” Conwall said.
Mark Fasciano is the managing director of Canrock Ventures at Thought Box 1 in Hicksville, and the founder of the business incubator ThoughtBox@LIU. Fasciano declined to comment about the investigation.
There is a coordinated effort between the investigations of ESD and the United States Department of Treasury. The investigation is “coordinated but separate,” Conwall said.
Canrock’s offices were originally located in the basement of the library, but moved to new offices on the third floor of Hillwood Commons in early September, according to William Kirker, director of the Facilities Department. Kirker did not know the details of the company’s lease agreement with the university.
The office of President Dr. Kimberly Cline did not comment on the investigation. The Pioneer received a response from Dianne Zoppa, Director of Public Relations for LIU. Zoppa said, “LIU Post does not comment on the investigations of other companies.”

Dr. Sean A. Grennan, a former New York Police Department investigator and professor of Criminal Justice at LIU Post, passed away on Tuesday, Oct. 28, from a long-fought battle with cancer.
Spending most of his life patrolling within different areas of the police force, Dr. Grennan enlightened the classroom sessions through real life experiences. His abundance to help was appreciated by those who needed extra help in their college careers.
Dr. Grennan started off as a patrol officer in the mid-60s. He became one of the first decoy officers in the city, before moving on as an investigator in Harlem. Grennan was promoted to team leader, and capped off on top with the NYPD, directing the Investigative Training program at the New York City Police Academy.
With over 20 years of experience within the field, Dr. Grennan never really let go of these attributes when switching vocation. “Sean was the epitome of a cop’s cop,” Dr. Harvey Kushner, chair of the Criminal Justice department, said. “He had credentials any criminal justice academic needed—a Ph.D. in his specialty, a graduate certificate from the FBI National Academy, peer reviewed articles, and a popular textbook on gangs and organized crime.”
With his decorated resume as a police officer, and his own athletic background as a baseball player, Dr. Grennan served as the Faculty Athletic Representative (FAR) to oversee that the work was in compliance with NCAA regulations. He became the supportive soul for many students who needed extra assistance—especially for the many student-athletes who struggled to balance sports hours with their education.
“Sean always made himself available to our athletes. He would assist them in any way he could, whether at practices or games or just exercising around the facilities,” said Bryan Collins, head of the athletics department and head coach of the football team.
“His stories in class just made everything so much more interesting,” said Cemil Turan, a former Criminal Justice major at Post and a member of the men’s soccer team up until the 2013-14 season. “You never found anyone in his class on the phone or laptop,” Turan added, emphasizing how the technological advancements of today otherwise tend to snatch students’ attention away from professors.
“He was always able to relate his teaching to his life and would grab the students’ attention and interact with them,” said Morgan Kitton, a senior and member of the women’s soccer team. “I’ll miss his funny humor and great personality the most.”
He is survived by his wife, Peggy Grennan, and his two daughters, Megan Clough and Lauren Grennan.
The scheduled wake and funeral mass were held to honor Dr. Grennan only days after his passing. Those who wish to send their condolences can visit Dr. Grennan’s Facebook page @Sean Grennan and post a comment.

The Steven S. Hornstein Center for Public Policy, Public Opinion, and Electoral Analysis was founded after a generous donation was made by Steven S. Hornstein, an alumni from the class of 1980, and a member of the LIU Board of Trustees, according to Dr. Stanley Klein, a professor in the Political Science department and the director of the new center. Hornstein, who is a member of the university Board of Trustees and chief investment officer and managing member at his firm, Global Credit Advisors LLC., was a student in Dr. Klein’s classes when he attended LIU Post. Klein still keeps all the grades of every student he’s had in a filing cabinet in his office, located in Hoxie Hall.
The goal of the center is to create a unique polling and opinions forum for students that can be accessed by the media, researchers, and others. The service will also gain Post recognition in public space for their public opinions work. Klein stated that similar projects have earned previously unknown colleges, like Quinnipiac University and Marist Col- lege, recognition and made them synonymous with research and public opinion.
The Marist and Quinnipiac University polls are frequently cited for information by public officials, journalists, and researchers.
“Hornstein, an alum that ended up owning a hedge firm, donated [money] for this cause. The president of the university, Dr. Kimberly Cline, asked me to be in charge,” Klein said.
“The center had its first shot out of the box with a poll from Oct. 24 through the 29, and it will be the first of many,” Klein said, speaking from his office, which is cramped with books on public opinion and po- litical science. The recent poll was on whether or not students will vote, and if they’re voting for and are registered to the same party as their parents. “That’s what makes this [poll] unique,” Klein mentioned. “It’s not what they’re going to vote for, but if.”
“What they will use [the poll] for is up to the university,” Klein continued. “But in the spring, we’re going to have a panel on a major national issue.” Klein stated that they’re aiming to have the event in the Tilles Center, and that big names will be invited. “It’s still in the planning stages, but the issues in question [will concern issues such as] Ebola, ISIS, or health care. Big issues,” he said.
Look out for new polls in your school email throughout the fall and spring semesters, and keep an eye out for the panel in the spring.

The faculty of the Learning Communities Committee has been working to develop learning communities, an alternative approach to learning in an academic environment. This system is a preferred approach to learning on LIU Post campus, and mandatory for incoming freshman. The process began three years ago, according to John Lutz, chairperson of the English Department and director of the Learning Communities Committee.
In a learning community, students take two or more three-credit classes that share certain goals and are thematically linked together to provide a coherent experience. They are designed to explore how knowledge relates across diverse disciplines, and offer courses that can be applied towards core curriculum requirements. These particular classes promote open dialogue and intensive mentoring from professors.
“The purpose of learning communities is essentially that the courses speak to one another in some way,” Lutz said. “The overarching idea of learning communities is that the curriculum is usually divided into different disciplines such as philosophy, sociology, psychology, literature – but all knowledge is related. However, when students are taking courses throughout their degree, we don’t always have the opportunity to demonstrate to them all of the ways that [these] disciplines are related.”
There are two models of learning communities at LIU Post –the sophomore/junior learning communities and the freshman seminar. The learning communities’ model of the freshman seminar links a class to ENG 1, COLL 1, or both. Learning communities provide a unique way for students to accomplish their core requirements in a way that is more specifically tailored to them as an individual.
The ENG 1 classes that are provided within learning communities offer a certain theme. This Fall 2014 semester, the theme of Monsters; Gender, Sexuality & the Media; and the Stories We Tell are currently being offered as ENG 1 classes. The theme of Monsters is linked to Introduction to Philosophy: The Nature of Philosophy (PHI 8); the theme of Gender Sexuality, & the Media is linked to General Psychology I (PSY 1); and the theme of The Stories We Tell is linked to Introduction to Sociology: Transitions to Adulthood (SOC 1).
Nancy Frye, a Psychology professor and one of five members in the Learning Communities Committee, is currently teaching a PSY 1 class that is linked with an ENG 1 class taught by Laura Angyal, an Adjunct Professor of English. In ENG 1: Gender, Sexuality & the Media, students learn about gender roles, gender stereotypes, sexual orientation, and how the media has the ability to socially construct norms regarding these areas. In PSY 1, questions such as how people learn new information, how people perceive and make sense of the world, and how behaviors are defined as normal or abnormal are discussed.
“On some occasions, students won’t see the connection between Psychology and English. If I can help show them that link, that’s what I want to be able to help them with,” Frye said. “[In my PSY 1 class], we just talked about classical conditioning, which is how people make association[s] between certain things, and also operant conditioning, which is how sometimes engaging in [certain] behavior[s] can reinforce you for that behavior, which will cause you to keep doing it.” According to Frye, both of these ideas have relevance to the development of gender roles and gender stereotypes. “That’s a connection that students may not spontaneously think about, but having the courses connected in a learning community, I can help show them the connection.”
“When a student is taking two classes or more classes that are [thematically] linked, both of the professors have worked together to see how their courses relate to one another. They’ve thought out the connections between their courses, and they are actively working together to present the material in ways that demonstrate how those two fields of study are related,” Lutz said.
Professors are encouraged to attend a class in their learning community so that they are able to get a better understanding of how their course relates to the course that they are linked with. “It wouldn’t be unusual to see two professors teaching in a classroom at the same time,” he said. However, students still get credit for two separate classes.”
LIU Post is not the first school to implement learning communities on campus. The educational approach of learning communities have been proven to cause a greater sense of community, belonging, fulfillment of needs, shared events and emotional connections, and a feeling of loyalty to their group, according to a study conducted by David W. McMillan and David M. Chavis, “Sense of Community: A Definition and Theory,” in January 1986.
“The concept of learning communities did begin in the 1980’s; however, it has been developing over the past few decades,” Lutz said. “There are still many universities that are in the beginning stages of developing learning communities. New teaching practices sometimes take time to develop and become widely practiced. The growth of learning communities here is based on the [growing] interest of a group of faculty.”
In a traditional college environment, students are usually taught in the form of a lecture with few discussions. “This model is one that has been tried in many places and has actually proven to be effective in studies that have been done – it engages students,” Lutz said. “I personally believe that the most effective way for having people learn is to get them excited about what they are learning, and also to have them [believe] that it’s important.” Lutz continued, “Otherwise, it’s difficult [for a student] to want to learn about something that [they] don’t think is important. I think that the real purpose of offering these themed courses that combine [different] disciplines is to offer classes to students that will spark interest and excitement.”
“I remember my first year in college,” said Jeffrey Kane, LIU’s Vice President of Academic Affairs. “I felt isolated and that nobody cared about me as an individual. A lot of times in an academic setting, people are by themselves. Learning communities promote a sense of belonging for [a] student. A lot of times people think education is information, but it is actually exciting the imagination.”
Since students in the learning communities’ model receive intensive mentoring from professors and are in multiple classes with one another, a sense of familiarity, understanding and closeness can form. “Classes in learning communities are intentionally smaller than regular classes, and they’re designed to promote interaction among students and professors,” said Brian Sweeney, an assistant professor of Sociology, who teaches an Intro to Sociology class that is linked with COLL 1 and ENG 1 with the theme, “The Stories We Tell.”
“Students should expect to get to know one another and should expect to participate in class,” “Rather than sit and listen to a lecture, students should expect to discuss, debate, and analyze actively and collectively. The idea of learning communities is that we ‘learn better together’, and that knowledge is built collectively.”
Smaller classes create an intimate learning environment that promote dialogue and understanding, and allow professors and students to grow together. Learning communities are capped at 20 students, which is also the average class size at LIU Post. However, in traditional classes, sometimes the class capacity is 30 or more. In Professor Sweeney’s SOC 1 class, there are 18 students, and in Professor Angyal’s ENG 1: Gender, Sexuality & the Media class there are only 17 students.
“I’ve been in the position where I have more than one class with somebody,” said Melanie Spina, a junior Sociology major. “I think that you learn better when you’re learning with people who you know. It’s more exciting to attend class every day when there are people [there] that care about you. I’ve never taken a course in a learning community because I didn’t know about it, but if I did, I would have enrolled into one.”
For the Spring 2015 semester, a freshman seminar course will be offered that links General Psychology II, taught by Professor Frye, and Sociology 2, which focuses on the social institutions of New York, taught by Professor Sweeney. However, there will be no sophomore/junior learning communities offered until Fall 2015. “We want students to know about this opportunity and ask about it,” Lutz said. “Courses only run if they gain a certain enrollment. Since we’re trying something new, not a lot of students know about it.”
“I didn’t even know learning communities exist[ed],” said Danielle Sposato, a junior English major. “If I had known about them, I would have definitely asked my advisor about taking classes within a learning community. I know that sometimes students struggle with English, especially when they are not interested in it. With themed English classes, I think that even someone with no interest in English would enjoy it.”
Lutz is enthusiastic about the future of learning communities on campus. “Learning communities at LIU Post are expanding. I’m working on having at least 10 first-year seminars next fall and spring, and at least the same amount of upper level learning communities,” he said. “Students have the tendency to be passive because they feel as if they don’t have any choice. However, as a director of learning communities, I welcome the kind of combinations that students would find interesting.”

The outdoor basketball court east of Suffolk Hall was met with about 40 freshmen faces that wanted to paint the court’s brick wall green on Wednesday, Oct.29. At around 3:30 p.m., freshmen from two College 101 classes descended upon the outdoor basketball court. They started
to sweep away leaves, and then placed down tarps to paint the brick wall that runs along one side of the court.
Abby Van Vlerah, the Dean of Students, and her College 101 class were responsible for the idea. “My College 101 course chose the project,” Van Vlerah said. She also explained that the project is part of the service- learning component to the class, and that all College 101 courses are required to participate in service-learning projects. “Service-learning is an opportunity for students to experience a community-based project connected to the learning objectives of the class.”
“The basketball service-learning project was about making our campus look a little more beautiful, and we teamed up with another [College 101] class to make it possible,” said Julio Feliciano, a freshman Music Education major. “The students in the class are responsible for this project. Each class had their own idea of how they want[ed] to spend their community service time, but our professors and assistant teachers [combined] the ideas of both classes. Everyone contributed to the whole project. I feel like I accomplished our goal of getting the wall painted in under an hour which is pretty impressive to me.”
Victoria Zaccone, a senior Nutrition major and Chemistry minor, is a peer mentor for the College 101 class. “A peer mentor is someone who helps others in the class,” Zaccone explained. Zaccone mentioned that the brick wall around the outdoor court will get a Post “P” painted on it in the future by her class, but could not specify a date.

On Wednesday, Oct. 29, the LIU Post men’s and women’s basketball teams kicked off their seasons by hosting “Midnight Madness” in the gymnasium at the Pratt Recreation Center. Midnight Madness serves as a fan appreciation night where the basketball teams get a chance to showcase some of their skills to the Pioneer students. These students were also given the opportunity to win prizes by participating in a few contests.
This year’s night of madness opened for fans at 9.30 p.m., and the show started around 10.00 p.m. As the fans packed out the stands, players from both the men’s and women’s team threw t-shirts to the audience. The music was loud and the fans were energetic and eager to start the night up. After the distribution of t-shirts, both teams broke off in the hallways to prepare for their introductions, which gave the SGA (Student Government Association) time to perform. Players from both sides were introduced one by one at the middle of the court, starting from freshman up to seniors.
Throughout the night, there were three contests that featured participants from the student body. Fans were selected to compete in a free throw-shooting contest, a money scavenger hunt, and a half-court shot contest. In the scavenger hunt a thousand dollars of cash was on the line for participants, and the winner of the half-court shot received at 50-inch television with a new Xbox 1 game system.
“I believe Midnight Madness was a success because it was very interactive and energetic with the lights and music,” said Adonte Donastrory, a Business Management sophomore. “The most enjoyable time of the night for me was watching my fellow students compete for prizes,” Donastroy added.
The players also competed against each other in a friendly three-point competition, which featured players from the men’s team vs. players from the women’s team. It ended up being a close one, but players from the men’s team slightly edged the women’s team by two buckets (14-12).
The most exciting event of the night happened to be the dunk contest held by Sean Maduegbunam, Nick Kahn, and Greg Dotson from the men’s team. The contest featured high-flying energy dunks that had the crowd erupting and cheering on their feet.
“Midnight Madness had a good atmosphere with a great turnout, it’s a good way to kick off the season knowing we have this much support from the student body,” said junior guard Sean Maduegbunam. When asking Maduegbunam what Post fans could expect from this year’s team, he responded, “You can expect a tough group of guys buying into the program and giving it our all in order to execute coach Smiles’ plan.”
The event ended around 12.45 a.m. with students showing Post pride and extreme confidence in their basketball teams. Following the “Madness” in the Pratt was an after party held at the Tilles Center from 1 a.m. until about 2.15 a.m. A decent amount of students showed up, the vibe was good and the music was even better. However, the party couldn’t last too long because it still was a school night and students had to get to bed.
Midnight Madness was a huge success containing nearly a thousand post students in the gym. The energy was electric throughout the whole night and really illustrated post pride for the basketball teams. The women’s basketball team will have their first game of the 2014-2015 season against Adelphi and Pace at the ECC/NE-10 Challenge in Garden City, N.Y., on Nov. 14 and 15. The men’s team will open their season up against Division I Manhattan College this Saturday (Nov. 8) in Riverdale. Be sure to keep up with these two teams as they try to give it their all to keep Post fans proud.

When you think of a crush or a potential significant other, it used to be your next-door neighbor, or the hot guy who sits in the back row of the classroom, or even a pretty girl at the mall. You know you see them every day; so you make sure—for the guys—to have a fresh cut and to put on as much cologne to get their attention, and—for the girls—to spend a little bit more time in front of the mirror. You are on your guard at all times because you never know when they might pop up. Well, that was how mingling and dating worked prior to all the current technological advances.
Writing your number on a piece of paper, having a face-to-face conversation or talking on the phone are no longer the primary sources of communication in the 21st century. With the current technological advances, regular communication has suddenly been replaced with social networking via the Web or the Internet. Whether it is messaging someone on Facebook because they are attractive, following someone on Instagram because they have appealing pictures, or the new wave of finding love via dating apps, specifically Tinder, the most popular amongst college students; the evolution of technology has introduced a new way to meet people without a handshake, a smile, and good conversation.
Social networking has made dating and finding love so easy for people. Dating apps have been created for individuals to find love whenever and wherever. Tinder, a relatively new dating app, allows you to provide a picture, a brief biography about yourself, and your sexual preference. Once your information is uploaded, it is available for any Tinder member, specifically those within a close mile radius to where you live.
Many people feel that dating apps and online dating show a level of insecurity and immaturity; it limits face-to-face interaction. Jeremiah Aviles, a junior Childhood Education major said, “Living in a technological world, dating no longer has value. People are more comfortable sitting behind a screen than showing physical interest in an individual.” He continued, “Traditional dating gives you an impression of who the person is.”
However, there are people who appreciate the creation of dating apps because they feel they can’t find love any other way. “Meeting online is not negative because we are in a modern society; the impact of a relationship via dating apps depends on the individuals involved,” said Alba Rodriguez, a senior Childhood Education major. “I feel technology is not sufficient enough to sustain a strong foundation in a relationship. I’d rather a man ask me out to a coffee date in person. A date should be no longer than 45 minutes and in person to genuinely get to know the person,” Rodriguez continued.
Though there are many different dating apps, they all have one goal in mind and that is to help its users to find love. But many people abuse dating apps and use it for their own personal pleasures rather than what it is geared to. “Tinder is just about sex. I’ve used it and it’s too raunchy,” Kenny Stanton, a senior Social Work major, said. “If I want to start a relationship my priority is not strictly physical.”
Jose Acosta, a freshman Political Science major, said, “I prefer the traditional style of dating, which is meeting your potential interest in person. Meeting someone on Tinder is not socially acceptable because you will automatically be judged.” Finding love on a dating app suggests to others that an individual is not competent enough to find love on their own.
Though the traditional style of dating is preferred over the new wave of dating apps that’s been surfacing; people acknowledge and respect all forms of dating. As long as it is a safe and honest situation where both parties involved are happy, it is no one else’s business. Love is for everybody; how you get it is up to you.

Gone are the days where your significant other would pick you up at your parent’s house (after receiving their blessing, of course) for “the big night out,” which usually called for dinner and a movie. This seldom happens in the 21st century, for a new form of matchmaking has seeped its way into our mainstream culture: online dating sites.
Dating sites like Match and eHarmony are just two of the multiple online forums that allow singles to find love on the World Wide Web. Match, which is the world’s largest online dating site, uses an algorithm called Synapse to play cupid with virtual profiles. According to the article “Inside Match.com: It’s All About The Algorithm,” published on slate.com in July 2011, “the Match algorithm uses a variety of factors to suggest possible mates. While taking into account a user’s preferences, it also learns from their actions on the site. Synapse also uses ‘triangulation’; that is, the algorithm looks at the behavior of similar users and factors in that information, too.”
Where Match is the online equivalent to the classifieds by offering loads of “matches” on one screen, eHarmony offered a different dating site model, according to The Guardian article “The Algorithm Method: How Internet Dating Became Everyone’s Route To A Perfect Love Match,” published in Feb. 2014. Founded in 2000 by Neil Clark Warren, the site “promis[ed] to guide its users towards long-term relationships – not just dating, but marriage. [Warren’s] research on 5,000 married couples laid the basis for a truly algorithmic approach to matching: the results of a 200-question survey of new members (the ‘core personality traits’), together with their communication patterns which were revealed while using the site.”
The reliability of these dating sites warrants no excuse, however, for the hookup culture that has formed under the URL umbrellas of OkCupid and Tinder, two less credible Internet dating forums. There’s also the issue of being “catfished,” which is defined as luring someone into a relationship by means of a fictional online persona. So this begs the question: are online relationships feasible replacements for the traditional dating customs of yesteryear?
“It’s socially acceptable in this age since everything is online now,” said Lauren Lipari, a sophomore Radiology Technology major. “I also feel like it’s easier to date online because people are afraid to talk to each other in person. There’s a lot of reliable dating websites where people actually fall in love and aren’t [at risk of] being catfished,” she added.
Melissa Walk, a sophomore Psychology major, said, “It depends on which [sites] you use. We know there have been many cases of mistaken identity [online], which [can] result in harmful situations. This is caused by the amount of personal information we share on these sites without knowing exactly who we’re talking to. Using match.com or eHarmony is safer since they’re more credible sites.”
“Match and eHarmony are typically structured for people who want genuine relationships,” said Jack Thedinga, a senior Political Science major. “Then you have sites like OkCupid and Tinder which are geared more towards casual relationships or even hookups. I personally think the traditional websites do a great job; they bring people together who might never have met otherwise. It’s even gaining popularity with the 60+ crowd who have lost loved ones, or never had the time before.” He continued, “Overall, I think it goes both ways. You have some sites that are beneficial, and others that don’t really add anything to society.”
Jake Scotto, a senior Broadcasting major, said, “Online dating, in my opinion, should be a last resort type of deal. I personally don’t trust the whole concept of it. You don’t know who someone really is by reading their online profile, and they could be someone totally different when you first meet them.” He continued, “Ironically enough, although I don’t agree with it, online dating seems to be more and more prevalent in today’s society. As a wedding DJ, I always ask the couples where they first met, and around 50 percent of them say something like match.com or eHarmony.”
Personally, I feel that signing up for any of these sites is the equivalent of selling your soul to the digital dating devil. For research purposes, I created a faux profile on Match in order to get a feel for the process. I felt I had no control over what I was getting myself into as an algorithm was calculating viable matches for me based on my personal credentials and dating preferences. Also, it was in no way encouraging seeing that they ask for your “outer beauty” characteristics such as body type and race—shouldn’t my future S.O. take me the way I am? To me, attraction, love, and relationships aren’t dictated by someone’s curves or the color of their skin, but rather your attraction to their “inner beauty.” My Political Science professor said something philosophically profound about this in one of his lectures: that the body is simply wrapping paper for a person’s true gift—their soul.
In my opinion, dating websites are a double-edged sword. Although there’s the potential in finding “the one” (if you’re comfortably leaving the search up to an automated algorithm), online dating is detrimental to traditional relationships. Where the old dating culture placed emphasis on sustaining long-term bonds based on face-to-face interactions with people you were genuinely interested in, today’s dating culture encourages singles of the world to “click yes” and “swipe right.”

Xinyu Sirie Zhang is an international student starting her freshman year at LIU Post with a major in Computer Science. Sirie was raised in China; she loves to cook and knows how to make many delicious Chinese delicacies. Sirie might be a master of the kitchen when it comes to preparing meals, but she also wants to learn how to bake cakes. Back home in China, Sirie has two adorable dogs named Panda and Snoopy, and one of Sirie’s hobbies is to collect fluffy dolls. Here are Sirie’s answers to a few questions about her life in America and China.
My favorite meal my mom makes back in China is: Dumplings! First, it is the traditional Chinese food. It’s very delicious and tastes absolutely different from American dumplings. Second, I enjoy the process of making dumplings. We always make dumplings together, and have a lot of fun talking.
What I like most about China is: The food, because it has many different types. Each type also has a different style, so for us, it is almost impossible to be tired of Chinese food!
My favorite Chinese holiday is: The Spring Festival. It’s the most important festival in China, just like Christmas is in America. It’s the festival to celebrate Chinese New Year. We all have a lot of holidays, and the whole family will be together to have lunch and dinner. The elderly will also give children money.
For my first Halloween in America: I just went to a Halloween party! I dressed up with a moonlight bite costume. I would have loved to go trick-or-treating, but not sure if that’s okay to do at my age. I also wanted to go to the city to see the parade!
My favorite thing about New York is: The people in New York, especially at our school! I was so nervous to go to another country alone with another language. But, I do feel very warm because people are really kind [and] help me a lot!
If I were to give advice to someone moving to China, I would tell them: There are really too many people in China. So if you want to move to China, you should feel comfortable with the crowd, especially in the city.
The biggest difference I noticed between American and Chinese cultures is: When we eat out in China we don’t need to give tips, and the tax doesn’t need to be calculated as extra.
I chose to come to America instead of Europe, for example, because: There are more universities that I can choose from. And for me, I think Europe is better to travel, and America is better to study!
The wildest thing I would want to do in my life is: Absolutely travel the world! If I do have a lot of money, I’m not going to buy luxuries, I will save it and travel the world to see more different and interesting things.
During a typical weekend in China: I always have lunch with my aunt, uncle, and cousins. Sometimes I go shopping with my mom, and other times I stay at home with my parents, enjoying TV shows, and talking a lot.
BONUS QUESTION –My favorite thing about LIU Post is: First, the grass and trees! It’s just like studying in the park; we can sit in the center of the lawn. Second is the people! On the first day I got here, many people helped me.
Mariel Bourie entered LIU Post this year as a freshman majoring in Vocal Performance. Mariel has been playing the piano and singing since she was eight years old. Aside from her musical talents, Mariel also gets involved in expressing herself through dance by doing gymnastics, kick line, and cheerleading for parts of her life. She has an older sister who also attends Post, and as an animal lover, she has two cats. When Mariel isn’t singing, playing piano, and getting involved in all the other activities she loves, she is working at Roosevelt Field Mall.
My first travel memory is: I went to California when I was five because my uncle and aunt live in San Francisco, and all I remember from the trip is throwing up from the plane ride and listening to Yellow Submarine by the Beatles.
The place I’d most like to visit someday is: Italy. One thing I can’t go to classes without is: My iPad.
The last thing I do before going to bed is: Check my phone.
My favorite fashion designer is: Chanel.
In the future I want to be: A famous singer/songwriter.
The singer/band/entertainer I would want at the Tilles Center would be: Either Lana Del Rey or The Weekend.
My soul food is: My mom’s apple pie.
My favorite part about Halloween is: Getting to wear a costume.
I go to LIU because: I love the campus, as well as the small class sizes that allow for individual attention.

Working hard at college is crucial to fulfill the aspirations you set before you came to Post. However, so is letting your hair down and having a party, fiesta, and just generally letting go of those worries and stresses that come with the horrendous workload the university throws upon us. This week, I wanted to find out whether people do this or not. Do they relax and relieve the tension, or do they stay cooped up in their dorm rooms and sweat out a few essays?
Before I go out and cut a few shapes at a party or bar with the American/Ecuadorian/Paraguayan/Scottish/Mexican/whatever species that huge giant Kevin LaBarbara is (a freshman goalie for the men’s soccer team), we all have shots of “water,” to hydrate, of course. Before we perform such well thought-out actions, we say the words: “Para arriba, para abajo, para centro, para dentro!” and in this moment of joy, happiness, worry-free and love, the feeling is amazing. None of us have the worry about “getting that essay in for Tuesday” or “preparing for that quiz on Monday.” No, we are thinking in the moment that we are relaxed and ready to—in the words of my Hispanic companions—FIESTA!
The reason for me feeling so strongly about why people should really relax when it comes to that never-coming weekend is that you have just had a tough, intense, and erratic week of school and work. There is scientific evidence proving that rest and partying helps the levels of concentration for the upcoming week… and if you want to know where I heard this fact, it was on Fox News! No, I am joking, but the principle stands; you can’t keep working 24-7 through each semester. YOU NEED A BREAK! And by a break, I don’t mean a hardcore session of Call of Duty (which is a quality game, by the way). Get out and socialize; go and meet a few more people and add them to your resume of Facebook friends or Instagram followers.
Even if you are not a very sociable person, there are many wicked and nice restaurants, let alone the next generation, mesmerizing, and best cinema I have ever been to, just up in Broadway Mall! Just try and get out of that “panic room” type box, which they call a dorm. Don’t even think about heading to the library; that is not a sufficient amount of “getting out.”
I totally understand that it is extremely important for us to study, and to study as hard as we can to get the best possible grades we can! The most frustrating thing in the world is when a person you know has that natural ability to know everything about everything and doesn’t have to put in the hours of revision you do, and then they take a test and get 100 out of a 100. Arghhh! So you may feel like “I don’t have the time to go out!” or “I need to get this essay done!” and these are valid reasons,
I guess…But what I would suggest for students is you don’t have to go out every weekend. Just go out on events. For example, this past weekend, the men’s soccer team held its annual Halloween party. It was huge; a perfect opportunity for people to dress up, enjoy themselves and have fun with people they hadn’t seen for a while. And I can tell you for a fact that no one was worrying about a midterm the following week. And the best part was that everyone had the whole of Sunday to study!
Finding out fun events like these can be pretty simple! For example, there are always loads of events on campus, such as Greek events during the week where they let you know what happens in that fraternity/sorority, how to join, or fun events that are coming up. There is also tons of information at the front desk of the infamous Hillwood, which contains upcoming “shindigs”(parties) or different gatherings that may be occurring soon.
These are, of course, “word-of-mouth” parties that happen sometimes where you can go or might get invited to, so ask your friends if there is anything happening this weekend! There is always the upmarket, sophisticated and the state-of-the-art college bars in Hempstead! What an interesting night that could turn out to be. If you’re free on Friday, try the happy hour at one of the modern localities, which are only 20 minutes away. However if you want to be extremely adventurous and courageous, the city (Manhattan) is the place you want to be. Anything goes. It is amazing!
Last Friday was another prime example of a great national event, Halloween, where you can scribble in to your dairies that you’re going out. Other events or dates worth celebrating are your friends’ birthdays (and notice the plural), Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Use these as opportunities to get your bum down to party central, wherever that may be, and “dance the night away.” It will do you a world of good—trust me.

During this time of year, scary movies are shown on television and in movie theaters across the country, but why the piqued interest in horror films? Is it the thrill of that edge-of-your-seat ambiance they provide? Or do people just enjoy getting scared? There is no particular “season” to watch a good horror flick, but the weeks both before and after Halloween are a great time to start. Though the holiday has passed, one can always catch up on their scary movie viewing.
Christopher Scally, a junior Information Technology major, said, “Halloween is a great time to enjoy all of the scary movies out there. Some of my favorites would have to be A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Halloween series.” Scally has spent the last month watching different horror films and going to some haunted houses.
Stephanie Rubenfeld, a senior Psychology major, agreed. “Horror movies definitely have their place during the month of October for Halloween.” Rubenfeld has been reading up on some horror novels, and watching a bunch of Halloween movie specials on different television stations, as well.
Robert Goldstein, a junior Accounting major, enjoys film remakes of classic horror movies. “I really like the Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and My Bloody Valentine remakes—they didn’t ruin the classics, [but] added new dimensions to the [original] films.”
The LIU Post students that were interviewed agreed that a good horror film has to have three main components—a believable lead role, a solid back story for either the victim or the killer, and a couple of plot twists along the way. Horror movies in general are an awesome way to prepare yourself for the colder weather—nothing better than sitting inside on a freezing cold day and watching a good horror film, even after Halloween. There are quite a bit of variations and sub genres of horror films, which gives viewers many options to choose from. Whether it be milder movies like the Scream franchise, or bloodier movies such as the Saw saga.
Many horror movies will be released this month, such as Starry Eyes, V.H.S. Viral, and Wolves just to name a few. Newly released is the thriller Ouija, a movie adaptation based on the supernatural board game. Other theatre releases include Dracula Untold, Annabelle, and a limited re-release of the first Saw film.

Senior Art Education major Danielle Savarese’s art show “Exposed” was held from Oct. 27 through Nov. 1 in the Hillwood Student Art League Gallery. The reception was held on Oct. 29 from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Dozens of pieces by the artist were on display in this solo exhibit.
Savarese’s work features imagery of skeletal figures and obscured parts of the human body that drip with blood-like paint down the can- vas. Colorful abstract pieces combat other, somewhat macabre images, seemingly creating a parallel of light and dark. “I enjoy creating pieces that are abstract with bold colors and movement,” Savarese said. “I tend to find myself using parts of the human figure with an edgy twist.”
The exhibit showcased a mix of mediums, including painting, photography, and ink printing. It seems appropriate that this exhibit, as something of a farewell to her studies at LIU, emphasized a raw portray- al of the artist and her work, including self-portraits. “I have always been inspired by the [saying] ‘art should comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable,’” Savarese said.
Inspirations for Savarese’s work include famed abstract pioneer Jackson Pollock. “I have been greatly influenced by Pollock’s unique painting style, which has molded me into the type of artist I am today,” Savarese explained. “Throughout my college years, I have discovered who I am, as an individual and an artist. As my work evolved, I began to peel back the layers that exposed my abstract emotions. My art allows me to express myself in a way words can’t.” Savarese plans to become an art teacher and have her work featured in New York City galleries.
