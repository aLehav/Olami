A Mexican Christmas celebration called Los Posadas was celebrated on campus, on Wednesday, Dec. 5. In Spanish, Las Posadas means “the inns” or ”the lodgings” and represents the Biblical journey of Mary and Joseph as they searched for a shelter in Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus.

“This is the Catholic event on Christmas season,” said Father Ted Brown, the chaplain at LIU Post’s Interfaith Center. “From nine days before to the Christmas Eve, Latin American Catholics do this custom every night,” he stated.
Traditionally in Mexico, people gather in a neighborhood home to have a party each night from Dec. 16 to 24. Children get dressed as shepherds, angels, Mary, and Joseph. An angel leads the guests carrying candles to the house—in this case, a dorm. They sing a carol to ask for shelter, and then the host sings a reply regarding their request. After that, guests are welcome to have a party. They end the party with a pinata shaped like the Christmas star. The last day of Las Posadas is on Dec. 24, which is followed by midnight mass, the celebration of Jesus Christ.
People who took part in the custom gathered in the campus chapel, and then the journey began. Students played pilgrims who traveled from house to house searching until they reached a designated home where Las Posadas would be celebrated. First, they made rounds to each dorm, carrying candles with them. When a group of around 15 students reached each dorm, they sang a carol such as “Joy to the World.” After going around the dorms, they went to the Interfaith Center, which is regarded as the shelter, and decorated the chapel.
“I came to join this because it sounded fun,” said Aimee Biernacki, sophomore Healthcare Administration major. “It is a good way to come together with other students, so I want to come back again next year,” she added.
This was the fourth celebration for Matt Mason, senior Criminal Justice major. “As it gives me [a sense of] community, I came to this since I entered LIU Post,” he stated. Mason added that he would have wanted join this seasonal custom even if he weren’t a Catholic.
“Originally, Las Posadas is a Catholic custom, but it is not only for the Catholic on campus” said David Armas, junior Sociology major, who is the vice president of the Newman Club Catholic Community, LIU Post’s Catholic student organization. He continued, “Las Posadas this year was really successful. Many people stayed [until] around 11 p.m. to decorate the chapel.”
The Interfaith Center is currently decorated with a Christmas tree, along with green and red lights. The decoration was done by those who took part in Las Posadas.

It’s been almost a year since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. On Dec. 14, 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza opened fire on the school’s students and faculty, taking the lives of 20 children and six staff members. As police and first responders arrived, Lanza took his own life before they could arrest him. Lanza was in possession of two firearms at the time of the shooting.
As we look back and remember that tragic day, questions arise: What could have been done
to prevent the Sandy Hook shooting, and what can be done to prevent another school shooting? Should there be stricter laws in terms of firearms? “As a future teacher, Sandy Hook was devastating. Something like that could happen anywhere, and it makes me think what I would do in that situation. Unfortunately, I don’t think gun laws would help. I think security would be the best bet. Drugs are illegal, and they are still pretty accessible. I think gun laws would be the same,” said Melanie Van Voorhees, a junior Education major.
Since the tragedy at Sandy Hook, legislation has attempted to tighten gun control. For example, in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act of 2013, which tightens the state’s assault weapons ban, limits gun magazine capacity, requires background checks for gun and ammunition sales, toughens penalties for illegal gun use, and exempts gun permit data from public records requests. In Connecticut, Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed a bipartisan gun control bill limiting gun magazine size. Also, the bill requires background checks for all gun purchases and expands the definition of
an assault weapon. On a national level, President Obama signed 23 executive orders created to reduce gun violence.
Actions have also been taken to ensure students’ and staff’s safety at school. To set an example, schools in the Chicago area have taken newer safety precautions. Security in Dirksen Middle School has increased in Calumet City, Illinois and metal detectors were installed. In Niles, there was an increase of police patrols around schools throughout the town.
In Glen Cove, safety precautions were also taken after Sandy Hook. “When I did my student teaching at Glen Cove, sheltering drills became very important. In taking extra precaution, the school had all of its teachers keep their doors locked at all times, whether in or out of the classroom,” said Kristy Niemeyer, LIU Post graduate and Education major. “My cooperating teacher told me that they started this security policy due to Sandy Hook and also Virginia Tech. Also, when you entered the school, you had to check in and you had to be granted access to enter both the school and the classrooms. This is to ensure that no intruders could set foot in the school,” Niemeyer added.
With those precautions taken so far, less gun violence in schools has become an important topic. Hopefully with these gun control laws in place, schools will be safer. Students and staff should not have to be afraid to attend classes.

Over the past few weeks, the pressure of the closing semester has forced the slackers and the overburdened to become creative and inventive. Professors have probably heard both legitimate and bogus excuses from their students. However, some students have part-time or full-time jobs off campus, family troubles, or other issues outside of school. Therefore, this time of year can be called, “Excuse Season.” But are some of these excuses true, or do students just buy themselves some extra time to get things done?
Professor Pat Aievoli, the director of the Interactive Multimedia Arts program, when asked about his opinion on excuses at this time of year, began to chuckle. “Oh, I’ve received plenty of them,” said Aievoli. “As a student 25 years ago, I learned to get everything done before Thanksgiving break.” Aievoli believes it is essential to get your work done as soon as possible because excuses are unacceptable.
As students, we have all heard some pretty wild excuses, and a good majority of us are guilty of giving out a few ourselves. In an informal survey on campus, students admit they have used excuses in the past when they weren’t ready to hand in an assignment or take a test.
Yanna Gatanas, a Public Relations junior, has overheard a few excuses during her college career. “Yeah, someone told my professor they were out of town, and their flight got delayed so they weren’t able to make the final test,” she said.
Janae Finlator, a Public Relations senior, has also told her professors a couple of excuses before. “I told my professor I had strep throat before so I couldn’t hand in an assignment,” said Finlator. “Another excuse I used was back spasms; older teachers can relate to that.”
One of the most commonly used excuses was a death in the family. Students tend to try to play with a teacher’s emotional side in order for them to be able get some extra time. Now, all students don’t lie, but some excuses are just outrageous.
There are other students, however, who just don’t believe in excuses. “I used to give excuses in high school, but I’ve matured greatly since then. I don’t like excuses; just get your stuff done, that’s it, ” said Najai Shepherd, sophomore Journalism major.
Sometimes excuses are just cushions for failure, and the more you become comfortable with excuses, the more accustomed you become with failure. This shall be a lesson to all students on campus. Try to not make excuses if they aren’t true—instead make changes.

As a child, you want to grow up, and when you grow up, you want to be a child; it’s certainly one of the true ironies of life. But one of the things that really makes us want to grow up is the thought of moving out, living on your own, having your own rules, playing your music as loudly as you want, having crazy parties, buying a pet giraffe, living with a big group of your friends, sleeping until whenever you want, and living in a complete and utter mess, and cleaning your room every – well, never!
But is living away from home without your parents really all it’s cracked up to be?
When moving away to college, there are many different options for housing, such as on campus in dorms, on campus in suites, on campus in apartments, off campus fraternity and sorority houses/apartments, off campus sports houses, or simply off campus with friends. One thing can be sure: your parents do not accompany you in any of those options. Not everyone decides to move away to college. Some stay local and attend college while living at home. For those who do move away for college, there are many aspects of living away from home that they love and some aspects of life at home with their family that they miss.
Mathias Spinnars, a senior Accounting major, lives off campus in a house full of soccer guys. He said, “I miss my mom’s cooking. Just having a meal cooked for you seems like such a luxury when you have lived away from home for four years.”
It turns out every single person interviewed by The Pioneer answered the very same way as Spinnars, which makes home cooked meals the thing that is missed the most. However, after the food was out of the way, a few other things seemed to be missed. Amanda Clark, a sophomore Business Administration major, lives off campus in an apartment. She stated, “My bed. I absolutely love my bed at home. I didn’t realize it until I slept somewhere else for nine months of the year.”
Monica Amador, a sophomore Criminal Justice major who lives on campus, said, “Just quality time with my family. Sometimes my parents just know exactly what to say to cheer me up.”
Another overwhelming home comfort seemed to be cleaning. “I miss walking into a clean bathroom and not even thinking about it. Now I just look in horror at all the cleaning I should do,” said Hilda Isce, a sophomore Biology major who lives in the dorms.
With all those home comforts, what is so appealing about living away from home? Why do so many students across the country decide living on their own is the right decision? Freedom is the golden word, the word said by every college kid ever. What aspects of freedom draw us in? Spinnars said, “I can just play my guitar as loud as I want – my house, my rules.” Similarly, Per Eik Forgaard, a junior Business major, likes his music as loud as possible without anyone to tell him otherwise.
Another trend in student responses was having no one to answer to. Carl Lystad, a junior Dance major, said, “If I want to do something, I can. I don’t have to ask permission; I just do it. That’s a great feeling as you really begin to grow up.”
All of the aforementioned reasons explain why living on your own is so fun, but does living on your own do anything to you as a person? Joey Forgaard, a sophomore English major, said, “Living away from home has helped me integrate with a group of people so well that I can live with them, talk to them, and iron out the problems that living in a house full of students brings. I have really grown up in these few months. I’ve changed from being dependent on my parents to being independent and standing on my own two feet.”
Jonathon Watkin, a senior Theatre major, felt the same way. “Living on my own has made me so independent. Becoming as independent as I am now would never have been possible if I still lived at home.”
Freedom is what living away from home gives college students, and independence is what they seem to draw from it. You won’t find many college kids who don’t miss a home cooked meal, having their laundry done, or even a nice clean bathroom to operate in. While living on your own most of the time cannot provide these things, living away from home can help you grow into an independent man or woman ready to tackle the big wide world.

Something that not everyone may know is that Christmas is celebrated differently in certain places around the globe. I may not know that much about other Christmas traditions, but I know a little something about how Christmas is celebrated in Norway. The traditions, food, etc. differs a little between the parts of Norway, but I am going tell you about a Norwegian west coast Christmas.
Christmas in Norway is rooted in the Lutheran tradition, although the Christian aspect has been weakened throughout the years. The religious aspects still hold in some places, as well as some traditions that most Norwegians uphold.
It all starts with advent on the first of December, which is the Christian tradition where you start preparing for the celebration of Jesus’ birth. In Norway, as children, we have an advent calendar with 24 days, and you get a small gift or candy for each day until Christmas Eve. A tradition that my family upheld during advent was to light one candle every Sunday on the four Sundays before Christmas. The houses are decorated with Christmas lights, and during advent, the color for decoration is purple. In the windows, people will place advent lights and a shining star.
When I was little, the schools would take the students to church
a week or so before Christmas. The school would also host Christmas workshops in which you made your own Christmas decorations, and they would host a Christmas tree celebration at which we all would eat porridge and sing and dance around the Christmas tree. Norway has become
increasingly more multicultural, so these traditions are not celebrated as much in school as they were before in order to be more politically correct.
In America, Christmas morning is very important, as it is the day of the gifts. In Norway, we do it a little differently. Our American equivalent of your Christmas Eve is celebrated on the 23rd, which we call little Christmas Eve. This is when the tree gets decorated and you relax before the big day, the 24th. On that day, Norway celebrates Christmas. Some go to church, some stay at home cooking, and some get in their cars to go see their family. On Christmas Eve, we eat a great meal. What people eat varies in the different parts of the country, but where I am from, we eat Stick Meat with boiled potatoes, rib fat and mashed kohlrabi. The meat is lamb. For dessert, we usually eat rice cream with raspberry or strawberry sauce. Porridge is also a staple in many homes on Christmas Eve. In the evening, we open the Christmas gifts.
So, that was a little about the Norwegian Christmas celebration. It is very similar, but I guess all countries, and all families, have their own special traditions. No matter how you and your family and friends celebrate Christmas, or even if you do not celebrate it at all, I hope that you have a great holiday season. Merry Christmas!

On Wednesday, Dec. 4, writing and literature professor Belinda Kremer presented her poetry in the Steinberg Art Museum during common hour. Known to the Pioneer community as director of the Writing Center, Kremer read her work to LIU Post students and faculty as a part of the Poetry Center’s fall semester seminars to bring art awareness to the school.
Kremer is a native Californian who now resides in Brooklyn, N.Y. She earned her M.F.A. in Poetry from the University of Michigan, and has had her poems published in literary magazines, such as “Calyx” and “Fence.” She has been published in chapbooks and poets’ books, including “Blue: Poems for New York,” and most recently “Departure.” Kremer is a winner of the Hopwood Award – a prize given to scholars from the University of Michigan – and the Meijer Fellowship. She currently is the poetry editor of “CONFRONTATION: The Literary Magazine.” During the event, Kremer shared pieces from her first book, entitled “DECOHERENCE,” published in January of this year, which explores the structure and modes of poetry, drawing allusions and form from aspects of contemporary science and media.
Kremer began her reading by stating that, “Teaching, like all aspects in life, becomes part of your writing.” “DECOHERENCE” is the quantum autobiography of “I” that tracks the unfolding, loss, and reconstitution of the self and the process of becoming. The theory suggests that while you are being one thing, you are not a multitude of other things, therefore missing out on “next to endless possibilities.” The confusing nature of this scientific concept is beautifully translated through Kremer’s poems in the book, which are driven by the theories of physics. Most of the poems read by Kremer were fueled by this idea of breaking the symmetry of the vacuum state – in layman’s terms, challenging the alienation of the 21st century soul and finding the possibilities of that soul’s reengagement.
Along with her style of poetry from the book, Kremer shared two Found poems. Found poetry is created by taking words or phrases from other sources and reframing them. The first poem was “found” through Kremer’s creation of a system of grammar that drew from the lines of “The Top 500 Poems,” by William Harmon. The second was based on items from the website, weheartit.com. Kremer hoped to express the idea of self-similarity through the work, but also created a poetry paradox, intertwining lines of sincerity (“I heart I love you this much”) with lines of comic relief (“I heart this couch”).
Students who attended the reading had positive opinions about Kremer’s unique poetic interpretations of science. “I really enjoyed how [Kremer] used science in conjunction with literature – two seemingly polar [opposite] academic areas,” said freshman Mathematics major David Mannlein.
“I thought [Kremer] was amazing, and I loved how she combined science and English together to make the science topics art,” said freshman Film major Melanie Coffey. “Also, the [“We Heart It”] poem about things people love was gorgeous, especially since you rarely think poetry is happy, but that poem was just pure happiness.”
Kremer’s scientific approach to literature introduces a whole new way to envision poetry. By incorporating aspects of theoretical physics into her series, Kremer inspires listeners to understand that “without decoherence, nothing new becomes.”
Poetry events on campus are run by director Joan Digby of the English department. This year, there have been several visiting readers including Prudence Wright Holmes, Steve Dalachinsky, Yuko Otomo, Kristiina Ehin, Silver Sepp, and Kremer. All of these readings were held in the Steinberg Art Museum. For more information, visit the LIU Post website events page.

The Pioneer recently interviewed indie-folk singer/songwriter Dan Krikorian, who independently released his fourth full-length album “Bloom” on Dec. 10.
“Bloom” is loosely inspired by the Daniel Wallace novel and Tim Burton film, “Big Fish.” Krikorian and Wallace met throughout the writing process, helping to conceptualize and develop “Bloom”. The album attempts to explore the search to find home which at times can be a place, a person, a feeling, or a mixture of things, with tracks including “Sweet Face,” “Wedding Day,” and “Afternoon.”
Most recently, Krikorian completed a European tour, opening for artists including Eddie Money and Foo Fighters, then going back to the United States to play with ALO. He wrote the new theme song for his hometown of Costa Mesa, Calif. In spring and summer of 2014, Krikorian is scheduled to be back on tour in Europe and the U.S.A. You can connect with Krikorian on Twitter @DanKrikorian.
The Pioneer (TP): You are about to independently release your fourth full-length album, “Bloom,” on Dec, 10. Tell us about the writing process.
Dan Krikorian (DK): I’m not a [really] regimented writer or have a set schedule, as much as I’d like to be. But I am constantly writing and working, whether it’s in the car, with my guitar, [when I am] out to dinner, or anywhere in between. I just try and stay ready to catch a lyric or idea when it decides to show up in front of me.
TP: Which of the new tracks is your favorite and why?
DK: That’s almost impossible to answer, but the song “Joe Purdy” is very important to me personally; the whole album is in that song.
TP: You found inspiration from author Daniel Wallace’s novel, “Big Fish,” which was later turned into a film directed by Tim Burton. What was it about the story that hooked you in and translated into song, then into an album?
DK: “Big Fish” [is] a beautiful story of an adventurous life. It doesn’t always make sense and certain things don’t add up the way they should. “Bloom” had a lot of those qualities of searching for the beauty in a long, and at times, winding path. “Big Fish” is a perfect piece of art, and I couldn’t help but be inspired by it.
TP: During the process, you were able to contact author Daniel Wallace to discuss your respective projects, further developing “Bloom.” How did this sort of collaboration begin and progress?
DK: About halfway through writing the album, I decided to email Daniel Wallace because I had a few questions about his story that I wanted to see if he might be willing to discuss. Daniel was kind enough to respond, and we talked a few times throughout the process of recording the album. He was very kind and open about “Big Fish,” and we had some great chats about the album and art/writing in general. He’s an amazing writer and so gracious. I can’t thank him enough.
TP: After the 2011 release of your third album, “Windsor Blue,” you opened for notable artists in the United States, including the Foo Fighters. What was this experience like and how did you keep yourself entertained on tour?
DK: “Windsor Blue” opened some doors and opportunities that I’m so
thankful for. Opening for those great acts was a tremendous learning experience. You get a chance to study them up close and see what makes them so great. All those acts put in countless hours to their craft; it’s always an honor to be on the same stage as them.
I’m also a college basketball coach for Chapman University, so when I’m on tour I love to relax by staying up to date on all things sports related. Also, I love finding old bookstores in new cities I travel to on tour. I’ll always buy an old book from a random little store. Who wouldn’t want an old Kurt Vonnegut book from a store in Cody, Wyoming?
TP: What advice do you have for college students who want to get ahead or break into the [music] business?
DK: Get into it because you love music and be willing to spend years and years perfecting your craft. You can’t skip steps to anywhere worth going.
TP: If you were not performing, what would you be doing professionally and why?
DK: “I love coaching basketball and I feel at home there as well. I’m lucky enough to be doing music and coaching right now. I spring out of bed for both.
TP: As a send off, tell us about one of your YOLO (you only live once) moments.
DK: I got to be at the finish line when my mom completed a marathon last year. What better moments in life are there than seeing the ones you love succeed?”
