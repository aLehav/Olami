On Saturday, March 4, Women’s Hockey won the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance (NEWHA) for the third time in their program’s four-year history, defeating St.Anselm 2-0.
Sarah Rourke and Carrigan Umperville both had goals for the Sharks in the victory, and Goalie Tindra Holm made 18 saves in the shutout.
This matchup was set up with a 2-1 overtime thriller against Franklin Pierce the previous Wednesday, with Mikayla Lantto scoring the game-winning goal.
With this victory, LIU earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament for the first time ever. The Sharks are also the first school to represent the NEWHA in the National Championship.
Lantto started her collegiate hockey career at Penn State, where she played her first three seasons before transferring to LIU heading into this year. In an interview with WCWP, Lantto discussed her arrival to the Sharks.
“I actually knew about LIU pretty early on in my recruiting process when they announced the team, but ultimately was already decided on going to Penn State, but my teammate at the time at Belle Tire, Abby Latorella, committed here. When I decided to make a change to LIU, I had a lot of friends on the team, which is really nice just when you’re trying to figure out what it’s like and what kind of situation it’s going to be, so that was nice,” she said. “I chose LIU because I liked how new of a program it was and how much I could be a part of making history with the other girls, and I feel like we’ve already done that so far this year.”
This is also the first year for the team’s Head Coach Kelly Nash. Lantto felt this was a great chance for her to make her presence known under fresh leadership.
“I was honestly really excited for a new coaching staff. I thought it was a good opportunity to prove myself to them without any presumptions, and I think the same with other girls. Whatever position we were in last year didn’t have to be the case this year, and I’m the type of player that works really hard and likes competing,” she said. “That helped me throughout the year getting a spot in the lineup and just connecting with my linemates to help me there.”
This was by far Lantto’s most productive season offensively, scoring 10 goals and 18 points. Lantto credits her linemates Maggie Culp and Sarah Rourke for her success playing on the first line.
“I just tried to stay as consistent as possible. I’ve been with them for a while now, but I think we finally found our groove, and we worked well as a line because all of us dominate down low and create havoc in the offensive zone, and we clicked,” Lantto said.
In the semifinal game, there was one play where it looked like Lantto scored early on, but it was called off, and led to a scary moment where Lantto got off the ice slowly.
“It was weird because I watched the puck go in, and then I tried putting my arms up to celebrate and kind of hit the ice pretty hard, but luckily it was just a cramp,” she said. “It just made my line hungrier to go out there and get another one.”
Lantto reacts to her moment when she got the overtime goal 40 seconds in, sending her team to the NEWHA Championship.
“Culp couldn’t have put it in a better spot for me, so I was really happy I could put that one away for us,” she said. “We were all just really excited to be moving on to the championship game, and I’m grateful I could be a part of that with the first goal not counting.”
LIU went on to face the #6 ranked Wisconsin Badgers in the regional at Colgate University, where they ultimately lost 9-1.
The Sharks were led this season by Paula Bergstrom, Tindra Holm, and Jeanie Wallner, who were all named All-NEWHA First Team, and Carrigan Umperville, who made All-NEWHA Second Team. Bergstrom was also named NEWHA Defensive player of the year, while Holm was named NEWHA Goalie of the Year.
Lantto gives credit for much of the success of this team to Holm, who consistently keeps the Sharks in every game they play as a stable in goal.
“Tindra is a beast. It’s really important to have good goaltending, and so upfront, we need to put the puck in the net for her because she always does her job at the back end, and so we’re really excited to have her,” she said.
Despite the outcome, Lantto was excited to be a part of history in being on the Sharks’ first team to ever compete in the NCAA Tournament.
“I’m really grateful I was even given the opportunity to come to this team. It’s been so much fun playing with players that compete and just want to win and have fun, and everyone has the same goals in mind,” she said. “Everyone is super supportive of one another, and our coaches are amazing. Our staff go above and beyond for us, so it really is a great environment to be in and a great team to make history with.”
Wisconsin went on to win the National Championship. They defeated Colgate in the Regional 4-2 to send them to the Frozen 4, where they ultimately defeated Minnesota 3-2 in overtime, and then #1 ranked Ohio State 1-0, making this their seventh national title.

On Jan. 28, 2023, Meghan McNamara was inducted into the Long Island Metropolitan Hall of Fame. The ceremony took place at the Long Island Marriott Hotel in Uniondale. It was the Foundation’s 37th annual Hall of Fame ceremony. 
The Long Island Metropolitan Lacrosse Foundation (LIMLF) was established in 1985. It highlights the heritage and distinction of the sport on Long Island. Every year, LIMLF holds a dinner at which numerous individuals earn a spot in the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame honors coaches, players and officials who have been most influential in the development and future of lacrosse. The inductees are determined by the Board of LIMLF and the votes of members of the Foundation. 
The Division II lacrosse team’s abundance of achievements under her tenure makes her one of the most successful coaches in the history of lacrosse. She has accumulated a 195-38 record in Division II, ranking eighth all-time in the winning percentage of lacrosse coaches. In 2012 and 2013, McNamara was named Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association (IWLCA) Coach of the Year. McNamara won her 200th game as head coach on March 13, 2021,  defeating CCSU 11-5.
McNamara spoke about her overall career and passion for lacrosse.
“I developed that passion for lacrosse probably in sixth grade. I initially loved soccer, but my sister started playing lacrosse, and she needed someone to play with. As the youngest sister, I obviously had to play with her,” she said. We were able to go to the board of education and start a lacrosse program at our middle school. In eighth grade, we had a girls’ lacrosse program. It was just so enjoyable. It was fresh. It was brand new. I was in my teenage years,getting into high school, and it just started clicking. I played many sports like basketball and soccer, but lacrosse was amazing.”
McNamara graduated from the University of Maryland in 2001. She had four national championships during her college career. Before becoming a coach, McNamara taught as a junior sailing instructor. Her experiences as an educator at the time led her to realize that this is what she was meant to do. 
“I sailed during my summers. I started teaching sailing when I was a junior sailing instructor. It was just so awesome being able to be hands-on and teach these little kids how to sail. That was eye-opening. In college, we did a lot of camps and clinics. I always wanted to be able to teach. I wanted to be a teacher when I grew up. My family is full of educators,” she said. “With the sport, it just naturally clicked. I thought when I graduated, I might as well give it a try with collegiate athletics. Stony Brook started their program, and their head coach at the time needed an assistant. So the timing just worked out.” 
McNamara is entering her 16th season at LIU.
“Every year is exciting. Every year there are new opportunities, players and teams. I’ve been here since 2006. So, it’s always been awesome because you’re working to do the best that you can to be able to put out a championship team and be able to compete. The transition into Division I has been nice,” she said.
As with most occupations, coaching collegiate athletics can get overwhelming and stressful. 
“As a coach, you have to know when you can turn off the button and rest. You have to make sure you have the most energy and mental capacity to  coach and take care of the team. This will enable you to prepare the team and student-athletes. I listen to podcasts and read books to continue to grow and get better. I need to manage all the life changes and things taking place in our world and student athletes’ worlds and their families and our families,” she said. “You need downtime, you’re human. It’s not all [about] sports. You still have life and family outside. When I get a chance, I love getting on the golf course and spending time with my family. I love true crime. I’ll also read some historical nonfiction books to keep learning, as well as some romance.”
McNamara was shocked to learn she was being inducted into the Hall of Fame. She recalls being completely speechless.
“I couldn’t really talk about it. I couldn’t really believe it. Everything about it was very surreal. It’s not something I expected to accomplish. I never thought I would be inducted. This honor belongs to all of my team members, the teams I’ve worked with, my college experience and my colleagues. It’s our reward because I would never be where I am without everyone who’s been involved in my entire journey. I was extremely excited and emotional at the time of the ceremony. I was putting all my emotions on the back burner. It was so exciting and I was so happy. The ceremony was amazing,” she said. “My staff was at the ceremony as well as so many trailblazers that have made lacrosse such a huge hub. It was amazing listening to their stories. I had four of our players that were able to volunteer and be there and see the lacrosse community coming together for a wonderful night. It was incredible. It was memorable, meaningful and so neat to be in the same room as these men and women that have done so much for this amazing sport. Being associated with all these people is incredible.”
One of McNamara’s favorite quotes is, “It is good to have an end to journey toward, but it is the journey that matters in the end,” by Ursula K Le Guin and Ernest Hemingway. Rather than focusing on a destination, it emphasizes that life is an ongoing journey. 
“I just want to play and do my finest. I want to do my all for my team. I just keep fighting. It’s fun that way. I love the thrill of it. I love competition. It’s fun to be challenged and to figure out how to beat this and come out on top. It’s a process. It’s patience, sweat, tears, smiles and everything you experience day by day,” she said. “Sometimes you don’t even know if you’re ever going to get there. It’s the light at the end of the tunnel mentality. Motivation is something that is just ingrained in me.”
Senior psychology major Hannah Kenneally spoke on head coach McNamara’s induction into the Long Island Lacrosse Hall of Fame. Kenneally played in 15 games in 2022, starting in 14 of them. She tallied 18 goals and 16 assists. She was named NEC Prime Performer on Feb. 13 and Feb. 27, and has been one of the top point scorers  on the team in her time. 
“I love coach Meg so much. Since transferring here, she has helped my personal growth tremendously. Her door is always open, and she dedicates herself to being there for her team on and off the field. I am very grateful because she pushes me to be better every day in areas I struggle with, even if it doesn’t directly have to do with lacrosse. She is a very patient and kind human, all while getting on us to push us to be better lacrosse players,” she said. “She puts a lot of focus on preparing for life after college. This is greatly appreciated since it isn’t technically necessary, but it shows the type of person  she is and how much she cares about us. Our team is so proud of Coach Meg for her accomplishment of being inducted into the Long Island hall of fame. She deserves it.”
LIU won their first conference game of the season on Saturday, March 18, defeating Saint Francis University 16-7 at home. They take on Merrimack College this Saturday, March 25 on the road.

With a 3-2 victory over the USA Tuesday, March 21, Japan has won the fifth World Baseball Classic (WBC), cementing themselves on top of the international baseball stage once again.
The game came down to one of the most electrifying plate appearances in baseball history, with superstars Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout facing off in the top of the 9th with 2 outs. Both Ohtani and Trout are teammates in the MLB with the Los Angeles Angels, but had to put their friendship aside as opponents, both as team captains for their respective countries in the WBC Final. Despite missing two fastballs at 100 mph, Trout was able to force the count full at 3-2, where Ohtani then fooled him with a back-door slider, ending the game and the tournament.
Ohtani, a once-in-a-lifetime generational talent both on the mound and at the plate, was named tournament MVP. As a pitcher, Ohtani had a 1.86 ERA (Earned Run Average), winning both games he started and getting the save in the Championship game. As a hitter, he had a 1.345 OPS (On Base + Slugging), cementing his legacy as a baseball icon on the international stage.
Sophomore pitcher for LIU Baseball, Tatsuya Uemoto, felt this team would not be complete if Ohtani was not on the roster.
“I feel that his participation in this tournament is very valuable for him and Japan. In fact, thanks to him, baseball has become very popular in Japan. He also seemed to be enjoying the game very much himself,” he said.
Despite cruising through the tournament, Uemoto knew it would be a hard matchup against the offense of the U.S. and felt the tough win against Mexico was needed to prove Japan had what it took to play from behind.
“We knew it was going to be a tough game with many star players in the U.S. lineup, so I think we were able to gain very good momentum thanks to the comeback win,” he said.
This WBC was highly anticipated after the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the completion by two extra years. This year’s tournament increased the competition from 16 teams to 20, spread out among four pools with five countries each, and the top two from each pool advancing to the quarter-finals.
After a 7-1 loss to Mexico, Team USA was at risk of not advancing past pool play for the first time ever. However, the U.S. went on a hot streak, beating Canada and Columbia to finish out pool play before advancing into the single elimination rounds. It was Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner who led the way for the U.S., mounting their comeback win with a grand slam to defeat Venezuela 9-7 in the quarter-finals, and hitting two home runs in their dominating win in the semi-finals 14-2 over Cuba.
Broadcasting alumni Ryan Boettcher believed the U.S. gave it all they had to get as far as they did.
“Coming into the WBC, I honestly thought the USA would be a top two team but fall short due to lack of pitching,” he said. “With the loss of Clayton Kershaw and Nestor Cortes right before the tournament, I was really uncomfortable with team USA’s starters, so I wasn’t 100 percent confident in them winning it all.”
Boettcher believed the loss to Mexico was crucial for the U.S. in stepping up their play, with every game critical to win from there on out.
“When the USA lost to Mexico, there was a flip of a switch that made the games a million times more enjoyable,” he said. “The team went from playing just to impress each other and the world to actually enjoying their teammates and soaking in all of the fun of the tournament.”
As a true fan of the sport, Boettcher will always remember the electrifying final moments.
“Pitch by pitch with the final at-bat of the WBC, I was just giddy realizing that the entire world got to see perhaps the two best players we’ve seen in the last 15 years face-off,” he said. “As the count went on and Ohtani blew by his fastball past Trout, I knew it was over for team USA because Shohei’s main issue is control, and he had a ton of it in that inning.”
Team Japan on the other hand, steamrolled through the entire tournament to start, sweeping their pool with four wins against Australia, Korea, Czech Republic and China, before beating Italy in the quarter-finals. All these wins were by a minimum of six runs.
Another team that made headlines this tournament is the Dominican Republic. The D.R. came into this year’s WBC with one of the most well-rounded rosters, full of major league talent.
Sophomore criminal justice major Shaylin Martinez speaks about what the sport of baseball means for Dominican culture, and why this tournament is so important for people who live in the D.R.
“Being raised in a Dominican family, baseball is literally life for many down on the island. We find so much enjoyment watching and playing it as a family. It’s an outlet for the majority of boys who grow up in poverty-stricken communities that don’t have resources to education, which is why many practice at a young age and end up in the big leagues,” she said. “There’s no doubt that the Dominican and Hispanic community had high expectations for the tournament for our reputation of great players.”
There were 171 Dominican born players in the MLB throughout the 2022 season, which was second only to the U.S.
However, the competition in their pool came to play. Venezuela was a major underdog, but went on to sweep the competition in the DR, Puerto Rico, Israel and Nicaragua. Both the D.R. and Puerto Rico defeated Nicaragua and Israel, setting up a rivalry game for the ages with the Dominican Republic facing Puerto Rico in a win-or-go game situation, with the winner clinching second place in the pool and moving on to the quarter-finals.
Puerto Rico would get the better end of this battle, defeating the Dominican Republic 5-2, using eight pitchers in the process to dominate the D.R.’s lineup.
Martinez was at this game in LoanDepot Park, home of the Miami Marlins. She felt the atmosphere of this game was like no other.
“You could hear people cheering blocks away from the stadium. There was so much energy, especially when you have two rival Caribbean islands going head to head. There were people dressed up as plantains to support D.R., people brought drums, traditional instruments and their loud music with them,” she said. “Everyone was happy to be there. There was so much excitement and pride bringing two similar and proud cultures together.”
Despite the outcome of this game, Martinez was happy to have been a part of this experience.
“To go home knowing we lost was beyond disappointing. Trust me, we were all so surprised. I even met Puerto Rican families rooting for D.R. and were in disbelief,” she said. “Although we were disappointed, there was no animosity with P.R. winning. Many of us thought our team for D.R. was overhyped and put too much pressure on the players.”
Martinez believes the WBC is a big part of baseball, and crucial to the growth of the sport worldwide.
“I feel like it builds the players’ character. People create great foundations and friendships. It creates a specific atmosphere only met at WBC. Expectations are definitely built off the WBC,” she said.
Mexico defeated Puerto Rico in the quarter-finals 5-4 in a comeback victory, sending them to the semi-finals for the first time ever, making them one of the biggest surprises in the tournament, and almost solidifying themselves in the championship game.
On Monday, March 20, Japan would end up mounting a comeback against Mexico in the semi-finals 6-5.
Mexico got off to an early lead, with Luis Urias hitting a three-run homer in the 4th. This would be matched with a three-run homer by Masataka Yoshida to tie the game at three in the 7th. Mexico would add two more in the top of the 8th, with Japan answering back with one, cutting it to a 5-4 game heading into the 9th. After holding Mexico scoreless in the top half of the inning, Munetaka Murakami hit a walk-off double, scoring Ohtani and Ukyo Shuto as the winning runs, solidifying them in the Championship Game.
Junior sports management major at Kennesaw State, Isaac Perez, was hoping for Team Mexico to have a strong showing this time around.
“Following a stretch of disappointing finishes in 2013 and 2017 where Mexico failed to advance out of pool play finishing 4th in their pool on both occasions, many fans were expecting Team Mexico to at least advance to the second round for the first time since 2009, especially with the amount of major leaguers on the roster,” he said.
Perez was extremely proud of Mexico’s performance, feeling they completely surpassed his expectations.
“Mexico fans are used to disappointment in team sports. From the previously mentioned last-place finish at the 2013 and 2017 WBC, a poor performance by the baseball team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and more recently, a disastrous display at the FIFA World Cup just last winter,” he said. “I don’t think anybody really expected us to be able to go toe to toe against baseball powerhouses like the US, Puerto Rico, and even Japan.”
Team Mexico was led by Tampa Bay Rays’ outfielder Randy Arozarena. Arozarena is Cuban born and was one of the greatest players in the country as a teenager, but defected to Mexico in 2015. Arozarena played professionally in Mexico before catching the eyes of major league scouts and signing with the St. Louis Cardinals.
With his entire family now residing in Mexico, Arozarena had tried to get nationality for years but pleaded to Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador over Instagram in 2021, asking to become a citizen with the desire to represent Mexico in the WBC. In April of 2022, his dream became a reality when he gained citizenship, making him eligible to play for Team Mexico.
Arozarena hit .450 with a .900 OPS in the tournament while also scoring the game-tying run in their eventual 5-4 win over Puerto Rico in the quarter-finals, and made a highlight defensive play, robbing a home run against Japan in the semi-final.
Perez was ecstatic with the play of Arozarena and felt many of his moments will always be remembered in the history of the WBC.
“It’s truly a great story, like a script out of a movie. Him asking to be able to represent Team Mexico in the Classic was his way of showing gratitude to Mexico for receiving him after defecting from Cuba, and I feel like he did more than enough,” he said. “He really made Mexico proud. To see that someone wants to represent your country like his own, wear your flag, and represent those colors is an awesome feeling. There’s a saying that goes ‘Los Mexicanos nacemos donde nos da la gana’ (Mexicans are born wherever we feel like it), and Randy Arozarena perfectly embodies that.”
Perez believes the performance of Team Mexico in the WBC drew enough eyes to dramatically grow the sport of baseball in Mexico.
“Baseball in Mexico is popular in certain regions, mostly along the pacific coast along Sonora, Sinaloa, and Jalisco, but this tournament had people from all across the country glued to their T.V.’s watching Team Mexico,” he said. “People who might’ve never gave baseball a shot were able to see how great this sport we all love really is. The more Mexican players reach the major leagues, the more the sentiment will grow, and I think we are headed in the right direction.”
This is Japan’s third WBC victory, as they won the first two in 2006 and 2009. The Dominican Republic won in 2013, and the USA won it the last time around against Puerto Rico in 2017.
Uemoto could not have been more pleased with the growth of baseball across the world, as shown by the 63 million viewers of Japan vs. Korea in pool play, more than any World Series game in history.
“I feel very happy. I also played baseball in Japan until high school, and I am grateful that baseball in Japan and Asia is attracting worldwide attention,” he said.
The next WBC will take place in 2026, the 20th anniversary of the first competition.

Lead singer of the band The 1975, Matty Healy, found himself in the middle of yet another scandal after making a number of problematic remarks on the podcast The Adam Friedland Show.
Healy made several offensive comments about multiple racial and ethnic groups, even accusing Harry Styles of queerbaiting.
The incident also included Healy joking about up and coming rapper Ice Spice’s ethnicity. 
Fans and others have wondered why he hasn’t received more criticism over his disparaging comments. Healy has not yet commented on the backlash he has received for his remarks.
Students on campus reacted to the controversy, sharing their thoughts on Healy’s comments.
“He should try to watch his mouth when talking about other public figures like Harry Styles who have a, for lack of better words, rabid fan base that will defend him until they’re cold in their grave,” sophomore film major Aidan Serviss said. 
After The 1975’s At Their Very Best UK concert tour in support of their fifth album, “Being Funny in a Foreign Language,” Healy has once again emerged as a significant artist in the indie rock community.
However, after many moments from the band’s tour went viral as a result of Healy’s behavior, which included eating raw meat and kissing fans, among other things, fans of Healy are now critical of the singer after his inappropriate behavior.
“It’s definitely weird and very much an entitled man knowing he’ll get away with anything and just doing it for a rise. I feel like he’s always been this way, but now that he’s popular again with his new album now he feels the need to be different and just do whatever,” senior art history major at Stony Brook University Jordan Isaac said.
Many people still support Healy, but find his behavior unsurprising.
“Do I agree with some of his views on certain things? No, I believe some of his beliefs are misguided and a little uneducated. I come at this with the understanding that Matty used to be a drug addict, he used to be young, and he’s a rockstar. But he’s in his thirties now, and he’s trying to reclaim the youth that he never got to fully experience when he was addicted to heroin. Personally, I think he should grow up and mature a little bit,” Serviss said. 
Like many others, Isaac discovered The 1975 when she was in middle school during the era of Tumblr and the height of the band’s success. She and many others continue to support him although wary of his recent controversies. 
“I can admit he was a big part of my childhood in like 2016 and whenever the first 1975 album came out, because it had a huge impact on me, not just musically but as a person, and so I’ll always have a soft spot for that and be grateful for him creating that music, but I think that this is the type of person that he is,” Isaac said. 
Serviss believes Healy has the right to express himself in whatever way he sees fit.
“Matty has a right to his opinion like anyone else, and his opinion isn’t harming anyone else other than maybe himself? Matty actually wasn’t advocating for anything to stop Harry Styles from queerbaiting, he was just voicing an opinion about it,” Serviss said. 
Some have claimed that his behavior is a performance, an ironic portrayal of fame and authenticity in an age of cancel culture.
“If it’s a bit, then it’s only funny to him. I don’t think anyone is in on the bit or enjoying the bit or in on it. I think it’s his weird ego trip that he thinks that he’s doing. If it is a bit, no one else is in on it. No one else is laughing or having a good time except for weirdos who agree with him,” Isaac said. 
Serviss believes he should tone it down and believes his behavior is lost in translation to some. 
“[The] manager [of the 1975], Jamie Osbourne, literally messages the band’s group chat to tell them to not joke about 9/11 when that day rolls around, because Matty has a history of joking about it. I understand why some people would think he was being offensive just for the hell of it. I do think he should curb his behavior a bit, given society’s need to cancel everyone who doesn’t conform to their own holier than thou views, but he is an independent, thirty year old man who can do whatever he wants. If he wants to face those repercussions, then by all means, let him be,” Serviss said.  
Although his actions have angered fans, they are hesitant to cancel him.
“I think a lot of like canceling people or canceling culture comes out of wanting to appear like you’re doing something good or wanting to not necessarily inform or educate people but more to punish them. He’s been in the industry for so long and I think that a lot of what he does is kind of daring people to cancel him, but I think there’s nothing wrong with people personally deciding to cancel him, for lack of a better word,” Isaac said. 
Serviss shared a similar opinion.
“This man has been canceled pretty much to hell and back for numerous different things, most of which involving his hot takes about sexuality and religion. He always seems to bounce back from it. I don’t think canceling him for this situation is exactly justified,” he said. 
The band will appear as the musical guests for an upcoming episode of “Saturday Night Live” (SNL) on March 11. Following their SNL performance, the band will continue with the rest of their U.S. tour.

Show Creator and Showrunner of “Succession” Jesse Armstrong revealed that the upcoming fourth season will be the show’s final run on the popular subscription platform HBO Max. 
Armstrong expressed his thoughts on the natural progression of the show in an article published by the New Yorker in February.
 “There’s a promise in the title of Succession. I’ve never thought this could go on forever. The end has always been kind of present in my mind. From season two, I’ve been trying to think: “Is it the next one, or the one after that, or is it the one after that?” he said.
Succession, since premiering in June 2018, has been a massive success. Raking in millions of viewers, and being distinguished as one of the top ranked programs on the HBO platform, second only to the notoriously watched series, “Game of Thrones.” 
With the immense success of the series, viewers and TV theorists have found comparisons between the business mogul character Logan Roy and Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, who owns newspapers such as The Sun, The Times, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as Sky, 21st Century Fox,and the News of the World. Murdoch’s children – Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence, are believed to possess certain characteristics with Logan Roy’s ambitious children Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Shiv (Sarah Snook), Roman (Kieran Culkin) and Connor (Alan Ruck). 
Amidst these theories, Armstrong stated that the Murdochs aren’t the only inspiration for the Roys, and that he draws inspiration from other media mogul families such as the Redstones and the Mercers.
With the highly anticipated season premiering mid March, writers of the show have left beloved fans spiraling to see what chaos will unfold in season four. 
Fans of the show on campus have also expressed their eagerness to watch the new season.
“Season four is gonna be the most interesting season,” senior business major Issac Richards said. “Last season was already intense but this is it, Kendall really knows how to push buttons, and I think he really put himself and his siblings in a tough position.” 
Another “Succession” fan on campus, junior accounting major Jessica Olrich, shared her thoughts on the show ending and offered a prediction.
“I don’t think there will be a happy ending to this show, I think a lot of people think that a TVshow needs a happy ending for the fans but in most cases like the show “Breaking Bad” there is no silver lining,”she said. “I don’t see any of the siblings getting the upper hand, because of how they handled their dad’s intentions on selling the company.” 
Olrich believes fans may be in for a surprise this season.
 “I think Logan probably [will be killed off]….I think there’s a big big shock coming this season and I’m really curious to see if that’s true,” she said.
Junior economics major Drew Garrison shared his thoughts on the legacy of the series. 
“This show obviously carries a lot of drama, but I feel like the general message the writers are conveying is that these big family businesses in reality have a lot more drama behind closed doors, and this show only highlights some of it,” he said.
Garrison elaborated on the impact the show has had on viewers.
 “I feel like the show has given viewers an insight to what it’s like being a part of a family at that high power. …The legacy of this show will definitely carry on throughout the next few decades with all these newer generations. The show is dramatic but also funny,” he added.
HBO reported that the season three premiere episode, which aired back in October 2021, had nearly 7 million viewers. What’s in store for the Roy family this season will be unveiled on March 23, as fans continue to anxiously wait.

“Outer Banks” made its return to Netflix on Feb. 18 with season three. This came with an announcement that the show was renewed for a fourth season. 
“Outer Banks” is about a group of six teenagers, John B, Sarah Cameron, JJ, Kiara, Pope and Cleo who call themselves the Pogues and go on a hunt for a long-lost treasure worth $400 million. 
With the new season, the show continues where it left off in season two: the pogues are stranded on a deserted island and they claim it as their own, naming it ‘Poguelandia’. After two months, they are rescued and begin a quest to find the biggest treasure; the city of gold, also known as El Dorado. 
The group goes against Carlos Singh, another treasure hunter who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the gold. Singh gets word that the group found the Cross of Santo Domingo in season two, he sends out his men to find the pogues and threaten them to give him the way to the gold. 
As the pogues go on the quest to find the gold, a big surprise comes out where John B’s father, Big John, is alive. The show made it seem that Ward Cameron, another treasure hunter, killed his father, Big John. Big John comes out from hiding and helps John B solve the treasure hunt.
Fans of the show shared their thoughts on this plot line.
“I think one of the worst things to come out of the show was having Big John alive. Although it was a nice reunion for John B and Big John, Big John is a terrible character. He clashed with the vibe of the show, and I think he was pulling John B in the wrong direction. I just hated every second he was on screen, as he ended up splitting John B from his friends for half the season which wasn’t cool,” junior speech pathology major at Molloy College Catherine Torres said.
Season three ends with a new mission for the Pogues: the hunt for Blackbeard’s Royal Merchant shipwreck. According to history books, the pirate spent much of his time in North Carolina, so season four could easily see the show go back to home territory in order to find his final resting place.
Season three was not only about finding the gold but it was also about the romance. The Pogues’ new adventure brought each other closer together in a different way. Kiara has fully moved on from her tenuous situationship with Pope, and started to explore her feelings for JJ, while Pope, who took the breakup with Kiara much harder, found a shoulder to lean on in the new Pogue this season, Cleo. While the original Romeo and Juliet on “Outer Banks,” John B and Sarah Cameron, are still madly in love with one another. 
Both Ward Cameron played by Charles Esten and Big John played by Charles Halford met their ends in season three. This means they will more than likely not be a part of season four. Although, the show has faked many deaths in the past so nothing is for certain. 
Fans of the show eagerly await season four.
“I’m excited for season four,” junior psychology major at SUNY Oneonta Caeley Curran said. “I do hope they add more twists and turns because that’s what makes a great show. Being at the edge of your seat not 100 percent knowing what’s going to happen next. Season one was definitely the best season but I have high hopes season four will be better.” 
As of March 22, Netflix has not yet shared a release date for “Outer Banks” season four.

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is one of the many technologies that has rapidly advanced over the past decade, as companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Google have embraced the emerging industry.  
One of the most recent developments came with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language-based A.I. that made waves when it was first released on Nov. 30, 2022. 
This chatbot, created by OpenAI, has been shown to be capable of having text conversations with users, while also having a variety of applications such as summarizing complicated topics, answering all types of questions and even writing an original text when asked. 
The language model was designed along with InstructGPT, which was designed as a “sibling model” to the more advanced software. Unlike most chatbots, both of these programs hold the capability to provide unique and specific responses, providing human-like responses. 
With the powerful tool being available for free public use, it has been met with a plethora of skepticism, particularly from those in the field of education, as concerns regarding plagiarism and cheating are at the forefront of the conversation.
Adjunct professor instructing primarily in the communications department, Dr. Jennifer Cusmano, understands the power that this new chatbot holds. 
“On the one hand, I see the benefits of technology like this for helping some people bring ideas or innovations perhaps that they could not articulate themselves or write themselves without a little help. So for some people, it will be helpful to help bring some ideas and perspectives to light,” Cusmano said. “However, on the flip side of that, as an educator, I’m troubled by the idea that we keep introducing technology that students become dependent on using, right? It’s like once the genie is out of the bottle, once it’s there and they adapt to it, you know that adaptation becomes reliance.”
Junior communications major Dominic Pieto sees the potential for its use. 
“ChatGPT is very interesting. It’s a program that has piqued a lot of people’s interest and has caused a lot of controversy,” Pieto said. “Pushing the envelope on education and technology is something that interests me… If used in the correct ways for fillers and not for entire essays, it definitely could be something to benefit students.”
Many schools across the country have taken steps to prevent its use, including an outright ban in various school districts. Junior broadcasting major Brendan Kaufman approves of these preventative measures. 
“How are you supposed to learn? I understand that you can Google things, but this is like the next evolution of Googling things. Do you want to get to that point? Probably not, because at that point, why even bother? Just look it up,” he said. “You can’t look up everything. If you want to look up how to cook, it’ll tell you how to cook. It won’t show you how to cook because it’s a robot. It can’t do that.”
Kaufman is not alone, as junior business management major Lauren Ritirato is also apprehensive to embrace the A.I. program.
“I think that could be really detrimental to our education. I don’t trust technology, so I don’t think I would ever use it, but I already am a little bit fearful because we have iPads in school and we can just look up all of the answers,” she said. “Now we just have A.I. right at our fingertips. So it’s kind of like, are we actually going to ever learn anything again?”
OpenAI has responded to these complaints, releasing an A.I. Text Classifier in order to detect whether a text was written by A.I., including ChatGPT on Jan. 31. They were not the first, however, as Edward Tian, a student at Princeton University, released GPTZero on Jan. 2, a software that can decipher the difference between text written by a human and ChatGPT.  
Since these releases, there have been various duplicate programs that have emerged as well, but none have been found to be 100 percent accurate as of now. 
Pieto thinks these platforms could impact ChatGPT’s use. 
“The plagiarism detectors will definitely turn some people away,” he said. “But in the same way, it kind of gets back to the original thought of why it should be used to kind of give help, not to completely supply answers for people.” 
Education is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential impact of this program. ChatGPT is already being experimented with in the workforce, with Amazon employees reporting its effectiveness in coding, customer service and more.  
For Ritirato, A.I.’s potential in the workforce is of the utmost concern.
“I’m thinking about our future doctors that are looking up things, or their our future lawyers that are just like, kind of exploring that,” she said. “How are we ever going to function as a society?’ I feel like we’re just going to rely too much on technology, and I feel like it is nowadays really common for technology to like, take place of our human jobs.”
Despite its many capabilities, ChatGPT remains limited by many factors, as OpenAI warns users of potentially incorrect and outdated information, along with the potential for “harmful instructions or biased content.”
Regardless of its limitations, Cusmano is worried about the impact technologies like ChatGPT will have on future generations.
“When we rely on technology to do the innovation, for us to do the thinking, for us to do the right thing for us, we are on a real slippery slope as a society,” Cusmano said. “In order to remain competitive in a global economy, we need not only thinkers who can innovate and bring great products and great services and new ideas to light, but you also have to be able to articulate those ideas, write about them strategically, write proposals, papers, studies. You can’t rely on A.I. to do that kind of work for you. My concern is that we’re breeding a whole generation to rely on technology when we really need to be teaching critical thinking skills, communication skills, both writing and speaking.”

Consumerism by definition means the protection or promotion of the interest of consumers. It’s a culture that revolves around the idea that personal satisfaction and economic stimulation stem from the purchasing of goods.
Nowadays, with the immense amount of platforms that come with social media, we are exposed to countless advertisements a day. This type of daily user exposure only expands the consumerism culture.
Students on campus had a variety of thoughts to share about consumerist culture. 
“I see issues with consumerism culture. I think it makes us more materialistic,”  sophomore health science major Gina Proviano said.
On the other hand, sophomore health science major Micheal Murro saw both an issue with the culture and some understanding of it. 
“I think when people are buying things just because they can and they have enough money to do it, it kinda throws off the whole buy what you need concept,” Murro said. “[However,] I think at the same time we all like to have nice things.” 
When it comes to this immense exposure of items to purchase on social media, many times an influencer is tied to them. An influencer is a person or thing that influences another and they try to do just that. One of the ways that this takes form is the promotion of goods.
A huge chunk of an influencer’s income comes from doing paid sponsorships with brands. Meaning these individuals are being paid to promote a brand’s product to their audience.   
However, the big question is: are influencers being honest or are they just trying to collect a check? Post students shared their thoughts on this. 
“I think [influencers] are not honest. I’ve seen a lot of influencers reviewing a product and you can just tell that they are doing it for their income and success,” sophomore communications major Mylie Norton commented. “In later posts, you see they aren’t even using that product and you can just tell it was a paid promotion.”
On a similar line, Murrow questioned the genuineness of influencers doing promotions.
“Even when you are scrolling on social media and see stuff like that, a lot of times it will say it’s a paid promotion which automatically makes you question whether or not they are actually using [what they are promoting regularly].” 
However, sometimes when we do see influencers promoting products, especially products that are viral or trending, we cave in and buy. And sometimes those products live up to their hype, but other times, like in Proviano’s experience, they are disappointing. 
“I bought the Keihl’s moisturizer, and it ended up just not moisturizing my skin. Influencers on Tik Tok and Instagram said it was amazing and it wasn’t. It was very expensive from Ulta and now it’s sitting at the bottom of my drawer, unused.” 
Now, if you are an active social media user, you have probably come across deinfluencing content. Deinfluencing is when someone has purchased products that are trending and have been raved about and they tell people not to buy it for various reasons. 
Post students expressed their encounters with deinfluencing.
“There was one Tik Toker who was influencing terrible products. He was basically just deinfluencing the products she was influencing,” Proviano said about her encounter with a video by influencer Jeffree Star. 
Norton gives the dupe trend as an example.
“People are recommending all these alternatives to name brand products, and so I guess that’s kinda like deinfluencing people from buying more expensive things and steering them toward cheaper versions.”
Deinfluencing can turn consumers away from buying products they don’t actually need. Post students agree that the deinfluencing culture is very beneficial to consumers.
“I feel like people are obsessed with having the next best thing and [deinfluencing] kind of takes that away. When you see all these people influencing, they make so much money and they can have whatever they want, but you know it’s not practical in your everyday life, and debunking them makes it a lot easier to scroll past that on social media,” Murro stated. 
At the end of the day, deinfluencing content may help individuals save money. Before buying the next viral or trending item, check if someone has deinfluenced it to know if it’s worth your money or not.

LIU Post is located in an accessible part of Long Island for students traveling from Nassau and Suffolk County, as well as New York City. 
However, this also means that the journey to get to campus could be a long one, because it is located in one of the most populated areas in the country. 
Junior actuarial science major Vincent Randazzo, who commutes from Bellerose, is adjusting to the post-COVID traffic by leaving himself enough time to get to campus so he does not risk being late to class. 
“I wake up and then I make sure that I leave the house with an extra 25 to 30 minutes, because sometimes there is an accident or construction, so I make sure to leave myself time in case anything goes wrong,” Randazzo said. “I check my phone and put in the directions and see how much time it will take, so I use that as a guide for when I need to leave. But if I know that it is going to rain or snow, then I will usually try to leave a little earlier because I know a lot of people don’t know how to drive in the rain or snow.” 
Over the last few years, the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to dissipate and many people have started to attend school and work in person again. These sudden changes have seemingly played a big role in the traffic jams seen in the big apple and on Long Island. 
“There are definitely more people on the road and less parking spots available on campus,” junior fashion merchandising major Grace Catanese said. Catanese commutes from Franklin Square, in Nassau County. “Almost everybody is commuting now, because they don’t really have the option of staying online anymore.” 
With New York City and the surrounding area passing Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and Houston as the most congested city in the nation as far as traffic goes, there is an unprecedented amount of traffic in the tri-state area. Since New York City is one of the most populated cities in the world year round, the city that never sleeps seemingly is only getting more crowded. 
“I feel like a lot of people have moved here over the years,” Catanese said when discussing the overcrowding of roads on the island and in the city. “I feel like there is so much opportunity in New York that so many people moved here, especially since COVID.” 
The 2020 census showed that the populations of all five boroughs of New York city, as well as Suffolk, Nassau and Westchester counties have all increased since 2010.
Randazzo believes that the population changes have a direct impact on traffic congestion in the New York City metro area. 
“Especially because New York City and Long Island are so heavily designed around using a car and there really isn’t great public transportation infrastructure. We have a lot of better public infrastructure than other states but that is only because we are close to the city. Long Island is quite literally designed around having a car to get to places, so it makes it easier on people to travel around this region.” 
Junior business management major Lauren Ritirato agrees with this sentiment, although says that COVID may have played a part in these population changes. 
“I feel like it’s hard to make a correlation with COVID being in the mix because people were off the road and now people are back on the road and there is an increase of people living in the city. So, I feel like it is a combination of everything that has led to more people moving to this section of the country,” she said. 
Ritirato understands the difficulty of spreading out the means of transportation, and hopes that public transportation is more readily available, especially on Long Island. 
“I know that it’s really hard on Long Island to use public transportation because I just feel like it’s not as accessible, especially the farther you go out on the island as you get further away from the city. So I definitely think maybe working those initiatives into Long Island policies and state sponsorships and just trying to get the word out there for that would be good to give people more options.”

Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) kicked off with the release of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” on Friday, Feb. 17, 2023. 
This film, which was highly anticipated by fans of the MCU, was met with mixed reactions by the audience and critics alike. 
Broadcasting alumni Ryan Boettcher has followed the MCU since the original Avengers, and thinks the most recent installment was average at best.
“I thought Ant-Man was enjoyable to watch with a group of friends,” Boettcher said. “But if we’re putting it on the list of best like Marvel movies, it’s nowhere near the top. It’s extremely mid, and I feel like it contributed nothing to the future of the MCU.”
Daniel Gron, a junior sports management major at St. John’s University, also had mixed feelings about the film. 
“If I were to give it a score out of ten, I would say it was six to me. It kind of gave me Sharkboy and Lava Girl vibes,” Gron said. “The script of the movie wasn’t really up to par. I get it was PG-13, but it was too childish for me.”
The critics have a similar sentiment, with IMDb giving the film a 6.4/10, while IGN scores the film a 7/10. Rotten Tomatoes shed light on the major difference between the critics and audience’s ratings of the film, as the critics scored it at 47 percent, while the audience had an 83 percent score.
Boettcher believes the critics got it right.
“The reviews were fair, but I think they have such high standards after Spider-Man and the other two Avengers movies that if anything doesn’t come close to those, they’re going to give it bad reviews,” he said. “So in comparison to other movies that were somewhat bad, but they get good reviews because they’re enjoyable, the Marvel movies get struck with harder reviews and harsher expectations because they want great movies.”
Despite the varied reviews, the movie had a strong opening weekend, grossing over $106 million domestically. The film’s second weekend wasn’t as promising, however, earning $32 million, a 69 percent drop-off. This marked the biggest sophomore weekend drop-off in the franchise’s history and was barely enough to remain at the top of the box office in its second week. 
This major drop-off at the box office has become a trend with Marvel’s most recent movies, as both “Black Widow” and “Thor: Love and Thunder” dropped over 67 percent after their respective debuts. 
Like most MCU fans, Gron thinks that Marvel has struggled to balance quality and quantity in recent years.
“Marvel has released so many TV shows and movies that it has been hard to keep up. I personally have not watched a lot of the shows,” Gron said. “I miss the days when there were just two or three movies a year.”
Boettcher shares in Gron’s criticism, believing the MCU may be in danger.
“I feel like [the MCU] is low-key falling off. They lost the big-name stars Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr., and they’re struggling to find new stars. Jonathan Majors is very good in the villain role so far, but they still need another hero besides Tom Holland that they can build a franchise on,” Boettcher said. “I don’t think people like Paul Rudd are going to do it, so I don’t know what’s next for them, but they need to get a new main star to fill the gaps.”
Although Boettcher has his fair share of concerns, he remains hopeful for the future of the MCU. 
“I’m excited for Secret Wars, which is not the next major movie because the next one is the Kang Dynasty. Secret Wars is where there’s like different dimensions fighting each other, and the X-Men are supposedly coming in that one. I’m excited for them to expand past just the original Marvel group and now have Fantastic Four and X-Men come into play,” Boettcher said.
The MCU is set to release two more films this calendar year, including Guardians of the Galaxy Volume three on May 5, along with two Disney+ exclusive shows. 
Gron believes that the MCU must go back to where its roots are in order to replicate its past success. 
“They have to bring back Iron Man and Captain America. They were their two biggest superheroes, and things haven’t been the same since they left,” he said. “Bringing them back in the next Avengers movie would be incredible for both the fans and the MCU as a whole.”

On Feb. 20, 2023, Marriott International’s President and CEO sat down with Yahoo Live to discuss how they’ve spearheaded a movement on one of the largest social issues within the hotel industry. 
“Human trafficking is a big focus in the company and it’s a personal passion for me and my family,” Marriott International CEO and President Anthony Capuano said. “Human trafficking is a scourge on humanity, and unfortunately, a lot of it happens using hotels as an environment.” 
Marriott International first introduced the initiative and their human trafficking awareness programs to customers and competitors alike in 2016. The services included training information and modules on how their employees should be able to identify the potential warning signs, safely monitor situations and know when to act or report on the events while attending to victims. 
“I am happy to hear that Marriott is taking another step forward to combat what is truly a worldwide problem. I love the fact that hotels are starting to take initiative to make people feel safe and even save lives,” graduate student Cassie Zangerle said. “I do feel that it should have come a bit sooner, but I believe that it’s a step in the right direction and other hotels should take note.” 
Since the launch, Mariott has also teamed up with two leading nonprofits that specialize in combating human trafficking and updated their training to coincide with today’s world. Along with End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism-USA (ECPAT-USA) and Polaris, Marriott International has updated their original training programs to better equip employees in most common situations. The main focus is to protect the guests, associates, and survivors when using the worldwide hotel lodging system they are entitled to. 
“Training plays a critical role in prevention efforts, and we are extremely grateful for Marriott’s generosity to provide these innovative human trafficking awareness training for free,” President & CEO of American Hotel & Lodging Association Chip Rogers said. “As of this year, we have already been able to train a million hotel workers since the original training was launched for free in 2020, and these new trainings will continue to help us get closer to our goal of training every hotel employee.”
According to the International Labour Organization’s most recent reports, human trafficking generates about $150 billion dollars a year in global profits with an estimated 26.6 million worldwide victims at any given time. Human trafficking incidents have risen 12 percent over the last five years and recent reports suggest it will continue to increase. The various ways of human trafficking have become merely untraceable in today’s technological world, so the warning signs are crucial. 
“It’s definitely reassuring that they’re hearing concerns and acting on them, whether those are concerns that executives shared with each other or loyal patrons have come forward with, you know? To know that the staff is trained to look for signs and know how to intervene is a plus because I don’t feel so on my own when I travel,” senior broadcasting major Kerry Cullen said. “I won’t exactly let my guard down when traveling, but it’s nice to know that someone or even the whole staff is watching my back. I don’t believe it’s an unconscious worry but a natural reflex.” 
Human trafficking is not a new issue in the United States hotel and lodging industry. Polaris found that the growth in human trafficking can directly be tied into the larger and underlying societal problems that put individuals at risk. Issues like poverty, discrimination, mental health crises and racism have all increased. The pandemic served as a contributor to most of the issues and made those struggling individuals more vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking. 
“For years the industry had an unofficial ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ style policy that didn’t necessarily encourage the bad behavior but certainly didn’t help to stop it. I am happy to hear that we are moving forward and building further protections for the potential victims of terrible crimes,” senior psychology major Mitch Merida said. “Yes, all of this proposed training sounds like a step in the right direction, but I’m not sure what else could be done without overwhelming local law enforcement or infringing on the guests themselves.” 
The sheer volume of human trafficking and the fear built from it has suggested that the solutions to it are as wide-ranging as the problems. They pose a society-wide effort for change and require immediate action. 
“As an industry that cares deeply about human rights and the horrible crime of human trafficking, we have a real responsibility to address this issue in a meaningful way,” Capuano said. “The updated training empowers a global workforce that stands ready to recognize and respond to human trafficking and allows our company to live up to our core values.” This most recent installation of Marriott International’s human trafficking training is the latest outlet of the company’s “Doing Good in Every Direction” initiative aimed at social change.
