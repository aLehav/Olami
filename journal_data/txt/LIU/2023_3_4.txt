The LIU Men’s Hockey team is wrapping up their 3rd season in program history. Currently, they have a record of 13-20-1, but their record does not tell the whole story. 
With many games against some of the nation’s best, the team held its own and put on some great showings. On Nov. 25, LIU had their first win against a ranked opponent in school history, defeating the Ohio State Buckeyes 3-2, who were ranked 12 in the nation. They also tied 2-2 vs Quinnipiac University on the road on Oct. 9, who at one point were ranked #1 in the nation.
In their final series, the Sharks had one of their most entertaining games of the season, dominating Alaska Anchorage 6-2 on Sunday, Feb. 26, in a matchup that featured high powered offense, physical competitiveness, and stellar goaltending from senior Brandon Perone. 
Redshirt freshman defenseman Xan Gurney believes that the team made great progress this season.
“I don’t think our record really shows as well of a season we’ve had so far, but a lot of close games, one goal losses which obviously staying real close to home, but we’ve been in there with a lot of ranked teams,” he said. “We beat Ohio State once this year, which is a really big win for our program. So that was cool for us, but it’s been a promising season for the years to come.”
The Sharks currently do not compete in a conference, which is why their schedule is balanced with teams all throughout the Division I level. Sophomore defenseman John Gormley enjoys  the diversity that comes with being an independent program.
“I think the coolest thing about being in an independent team is being able to load your schedule with high end teams all at the top of the rankings,” he said. “At the beginning of the season we played a number of top 20 teams and obviously beating a few and staying in there with a bunch of them is really cool.”
The Sharks have been lead by graduate forward Anthony Vincent, who currently leads the team with 35 points, and was nominated for the Hobey Baker Award, the honor given yearly to the best player in collegiate hockey. 
Gurney believes Vincent is finally getting the national recognition he deserves. 
“[Vincent] has had an unbelievable year, a big breakout year for him. His work ethic and honesty on and off the ice just goes to show If you stay with it, it’s going to pay off for you,” he said. “He works harder than most of the guys out there and production is showing the way that he is.”
Sophomore defenseman Dylan Shuett agrees with this sentiment. 
“It’s contagious all the way around in practice, being up the rink and at the gym. Guys that log big minutes like that, it’s going to take a toll on their body and just to see what he battles through on a daily basis with injuries and he’s still doing all the sets,” he said. “He doesn’t back down, he doesn’t shy away from any of that and that’s definitely contagious and that’s what you look for in a leader and it’s definitely inspiring for the rest of us to see what he goes through and how he battles every day in practice.”
When reflecting on the season, Shuett credits goalies Vinnie Purpura and Brandon Perrone for the team’s success. 
[Purpura] is a monster back there, we don’t get to where we are today without him back there. They’ve been unbelievable for us, when [Perrone] is in, he’s on and I think he doesn’t get enough credit because he pushes video in practice and keeps us all accountable,” he said. The two of them together make an awesome team and [Perrone] really stepped up big in the games that he’s been in for us.”
Gormley respects the dedication and commitment from Head Coach Brett Riley to the program.
“I think it’s so easy to buy into what he’s doing and how easy it is to play for him. Being able to see how much he cares, he built this program with his bare hands, him and the rest of his staff,” he said. “I think all the guys give him a lot of credit for how he built this program up from nothing. To see how much he cares about the program and how much he’s put into it, I think it makes it easy for the guys in the locker room to buy in for him.”
The Sharks have their final series of the season on the road against Arizona State on Friday, March 10 and Saturday, March 11.

As the National Hockey League (NHL) enters the final month and a half of the regular season, the New York teams are locked into tight playoff races in the Eastern Conference. 
This is especially true for the New York Islanders, who are currently one of six teams fighting for two wild-card spots. After a tough stretch losing 10 of 11 games in January, they have now won three of their last five games, including two over the Pittsburgh Penguins, a team competing with the Islanders for a wild card spot. 
Broadcasting alumni Joe Lonegro believes that the Islanders can make a run into the playoffs despite inconsistent play from the team. 
“If you asked me last week fresh off of a three-game losing streak to three much weaker teams when it comes to standings, it seemed like the team was collapsing and was not going to have what it takes,” Lonegro said. “Now, after beating Pittsburgh twice in four days with the amount of injuries they have, including their best player [Matt Barzal], and having guys like Lee, Horvat and Martin step up in key moments, you can’t help but think that they definitely could make the playoffs.” 
With the Islanders in a difficult spot, some expect them to be a team to watch at the trade deadline this Friday at 3 p.m. They already traded forwards Anthony Beauvillier and Aatu Raty, along with a conditional first-round pick in the 2023 NHL Draft for Bo Horvat, who scored 31 goals this season for the Vancouver Canucks and is already off to a hot start with the Islanders. 
Despite locking up Horvat for eight years, Lonegro thinks the Isles could make a few more moves. 
“With the amount of injuries, and of course, you hope some come back, you need a depth center that you can rely on just in case. I thought they’d move on from Scott Mayfield and Semyon Varlamov to get draft picks, but now that they’re right back in the hunt, I don’t see it happening,” he said.
New York stayed busy during deadline week when they made a trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday, getting Pierre Engvall for a third-round pick in the 2024 draft. 
“I think it’s a great bottom six depth move for an injury-depleted team making a push for the playoffs,” Lonegro said. “He can play left or right wing, is fast and good in transition, so I think he will compliment the Islanders well.” 
The Rangers are in a different situation, having won seven in a row with points in 10 straight games before three ugly losses. They are currently sitting just six points behind the New Jersey Devils for second in the Metropolitan Division and eight points ahead of the Islanders. 
Graduate speech pathology major Ryan Branigan has no doubts the Rangers can make the playoffs.
“They’re playing great but need the Devils to start losing more often to pass them. The Rangers are seemingly going all in at the trade deadline, trading Sammy Blais back to the Blues along with Hunter Skinner and two draft picks in the next two drafts for Vladimir Tarasenko and Niko Mikkola,” he said. “They brought back Tyler Motte from the Ottawa Senators, who was a good depth player for their playoff run last season, while also sending young forward Vitali Kravtsov to the Canucks for a prospect and draft pick.”    
The Rangers made a big splash Tuesday when they traded for Chicago Blackhawks superstar Patrick Kane. New York gave Chicago conditional second and fourth-round picks in this year’s draft for Kane.  
Branigan loved the move.
 “I’m ecstatic to see Kane on Broadway. Not giving up any high-level prospects or our other 2023 second-round pick was great. The only thing left to do is win the cup,” he said.
Once the Rangers make the playoffs, the big question surrounding them is if they can compete with the Boston Bruins, who are on pace for the most points in NHL history, or even a team like the surging Carolina Hurricanes. 
Branigan thinks the Rangers can be competitive, but will have to return to form and play consistently to have a realistic chance to beat those teams. 
“I think it’s possible. I definitely think they have what it takes to compete with the best in the East, so long as Igor Shesterkin returns to being a top goaltender in the league,” he said.
Ryan Boettcher, a broadcasting alumni, agrees that the Rangers can make a competitive run.
“As an Islander fan, I’m jealous because they have been winning consistently without even the best play from their goaltender. The last few weeks, Shesterkin has been iffy at best, but they are still winning most of their games,” he said. “I don’t think they will catch Carolina, but in the playoffs, they have a chance with a good combination of a good goaltender and high-powered offense.” 
Regarding his Islanders’ chances against the top teams in the league if they made the playoffs, Boettcher understands the uncertainty the Stanley Cup Playoffs bring. 
“A few years ago, the Tampa Bay Lightning had one of the best seasons ever and got swept in the first round by the Columbus Blue Jackets, so anything can happen,” he said. “When you look at the Islanders, they need to pray that Ilya Sorokin is Ilya Sorokin, and if he has one bad game, they are in trouble, but you never know.” 
Lonegro believes the Bruins are a dominant force that will be hard to stop at any point. 
“The Islanders have a better chance of beating the Hurricanes than the Bruins. Neither are easy, but Boston has outmatched basically everyone this season, including the Isles,” he said.
Lonegro remains confident in the Islanders chances this postseason.
“If they can get past the first round, the sky’s the limit. They’re good in the playoffs when they play structured hockey, and sometimes it has gone away, and they have looked vulnerable,” Lonegro said. “The last few wins they have had proves it is still there, so if they can be structured, they can beat anyone.”
The two local teams may be in two different situations, but it doesn’t change the fact that this final stretch run of the season is crucial. For the Islanders, they have to keep winning while also needing a lot of help against teams above them in the standings. The Rangers look to be in a good spot, but recent struggles highlight needed improvements to compete in the playoffs. 
It has been a wild NHL season thus far, and it should be a fun ending as an unprecedented amount of teams are battling to get into the dance.

Gymnastics has made tremendous strides as a program since its inaugural season in 2020-21. 
After setting a program record of 195.925 on Saturday, Feb. 18 against Towson, the Sharks made history again this past Sunday, scoring 195.650, which placed them second behind NC State, but was enough to defeat Temple in the tri-meet. 
The Sharks were fueled by incredible performances from the likes of Mara Titarsolej and Syd Morris, who both continued their strong seasons on Sunday. Titarsolej, a junior international relations and diplomacy major, scored a meet-best 9.950 on the bars, and Morris, a freshman film major, scored 39.300 on the all-around, topping her previous record of 39.275 that she set against Towson. 
Head Coach Randy Lane spoke highly of both athletes. 
“Mara Titarsoleji is phenomenal on bars. She just shines every time. We always joke about her getting a 9.950 and the elusive 10 this year that has been a little bit away. We are hoping that will come within the next three weeks and three meets, and hopefully, at the EAGL championship, she can win again,” Lane said. “Syd Morris, our freshman, they have done an incredible job of stepping up and being the all-around that we want. They broke the school record again on the all-around by just a little bit which is always great.”
With the duo leading the Sharks, this marked the first time in program history that the Sharks defeated a conference opponent, as they compete in the highly competitive East Atlantic Gymnastics League (EAGL). 
Lane made the significance of this meet clear. 
“This was an important meet for us because it is going to help us to see whether we get into regionals as a team or not. Being in the NCAA tournament is really important,” he said. “That is one of my goals and one of the team’s goals. We are gonna have a really hard time over these next few meets to get there, but I believe in this team and feel that we are capable of doing that.”
That wasn’t the only historic moment in Sunday’s meet, however, as the Sharks honored their inaugural Senior class on Senior Day. Draped in flowers and bouquets, Amanda Loo, Katy Koopman, and Nika Takagi were commemorated as the first Sharks to graduate after spending all three years with the program. 
Takagi had trouble reflecting on this momentous occasion for the program. 
“I don’t think it has hit me yet. It has been a crazy three years, and I am so glad I was able to do it with the team that we have today,” the senior medical imaging major said. “We have made strides over the past few years, and I am just proud of them and had a lot of fun today.”
Coach Lane spoke highly of the inaugural senior class. 
“It is always wonderful to have seniors graduate and feel a sense of pride. Honestly, I couldn’t be more proud of those seniors who came and transferred here when we started the program,” the former National Champion said. “They have helped build the culture here of what it is today, and they are a big part of our success so far.”
Loo, a senior business major with a concentration in marketing, reflected on the journey her team has been on these last three seasons. 
“Being a new program, I think it is hard knowing our worth because we didn’t have any background stats or anything previously, so I think slowly over time, we have learned that we can play with the big dogs and be as great as anyone else,” she said. “Gymnastics is a sport that is not a contact sport, everything is on you, and anything can happen with scores. There is no one stopping you. This year we realized that we can do anything the other teams are doing. Once we did that, we started focusing on details, and we just started getting better and better.”
Takagi attributes the team’s success to the mindset adopted by the entire program. 
“Our keyword these last few years has been progress. In these last three years, all we have wanted to do is progress, progress, progress, and we keep doing that. Just doing our normal gymnastics and doing what we know how to do best. We just continue to do that, and it has been working as we have been beating our records time and time again.”
Outside of the tremendous improvement reflected in the scores since the program was founded, gymnastics has also seen growth in the stands as well, with Sunday’s meet being one of the most attended in the program’s history. 
Koopman felt the energy provided by the crowd at the Pratt Recreational Center. 
“Personally, the bigger the crowd, the better the performance because you have that many more people behind your back. We know people on every team too, but I feel like gymnastics is a different sport where everybody is friends with everybody, which is really different compared to other sports. I feel like the crowd is finally seeing what we can do, and they are telling their friends to come,” the senior psychology major said. “The crowd gets bigger and bigger every time, and it is gonna keep getting bigger. I think we are all realizing that we are going up from here.”
Loo shared in Koopman’s enthusiasm regarding the fan turnout this year. 
“I honestly love performing in front of the crowd, but it is honestly more special when I am 
performing in front of my own home crowd. I love doing floor. I love showing off, so being able to look in the crowd and see the faces of all the people I know is so crazy,” she said. “In our little floor routines, we always have an LIU part, and that was the loudest I have ever heard during my floor routine, everyone yelled. It was surreal.”
With four meets remaining, including the EAGL Conference Championships on Saturday, Mar. 18, Koopman feels there is much to look forward to. 
“Honestly, the team’s growth is what I am looking forward to because overall, we are growing,” she said. The numbers are way higher than they have ever been, and our team, numbers-wise, is getting better and better. I think that is the biggest thing we have to look forward to this year, that growth and getting better as a team.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) art generating companies are recent targets of lawsuits brought by artists who claim the services infringed copyright.
Three artists are in a lawsuit against the company, Stability AI. The artists Kelly McKernan, Sarah Anderson and Karla Ortiz claim AI generators have exploited their artwork without their permission to create the training for the program’s algorithms.
However, the trio of artists are not alone. Getty Images has also filed a lawsuit against Stability AI. 
The photography company claims that Stability AI copied more than 12 million images from its database without permission or compensation. 
The two lawsuits are the latest in the ongoing legal battle between the creators of AI art generators and artists. 
The increasing popularity of AI art generated programs, as well as the recent lawsuits, leaves many wondering where the increase of AI art development came from as well as if AI generated art is actually theft. 
A program called DALL-E, a combination of the names of the cartoon robot WALL-E and the Spanish artist Salvador Dalí, was introduced by OpenAI in Jan. 2021. 
A year later, DALL-E 2 was created, allowing for more realistic and accurate images with 4x greater resolution. 
However, both programs were not available to the general public and applicants were placed on a waiting list until Sep. 2022. 
During the waiting period, many created other text to image generators. 
With the availability of several AI programs, anyone can instantly design anything they want to see on their computer screen. 
Students on campus shared their thoughts on AI generated art and whether they would personally use it while making art.
“I can understand how it could be a valuable tool in the hands of other artists. I’m sure it’s capable of saving a large amount of time on commercial projects and will eventually leave many without jobs. But personally, I am against the idea of artificial intelligence as a whole, so I do not plan on incorporating it into my artwork at any point,” junior digital art and design major Michael Moffa said. 
Junior art therapy major Olivia Glusic agreed that it could save time for artists, as well as be a source of inspiration.
“I think it’s a really unique way of helping an artist’s creative process. Art has really expanded within the past couple of years, especially digital art and illustration. AI really helps get rid of some of the more tedious or busy work steps of the art making process,” Glusic said. 
There is a lot of controversy over whether AI-created art can be considered art since these programs evaluate hundreds of pieces of existing content and utilize that to analyze and learn to eventually generate their own work. 
Moffa commented on the lack of emotional depth available with AI generated art.
“For art to be art, it has to be created with emotion. While humans are not the only beings on the face of the planet capable of emotion, I do think that they’re the only ones that are capable of representing their emotions in the form of art,” Moffa said. 
Glusic shared a different perspective on the relationship between emotions and art and whether AI undermines that.
“I don’t think art necessarily needs to be human-made for it to be considered art. I focus more on the interpretation of art; how you view different forms of art, and what it means to you. Art doesn’t necessarily have defining guidelines or rules, it’s about the message you receive from it,” Glusic said. 
Many artists are conflicted about the use of AI while others view it as a tool. Moffa is wary of the sudden rise of AI.
“AI is right near the top of the list of dangers that face the human race. With that being said, I find any art that’s produced by artificial intelligence to be terrifying,” Moffa said. 
Glusic, on the other hand, views the incorporation of AI into art in a more positive light.
“AI art is in a separate category from human made art, but it can still create communication, or a message for the viewer. If AI art can create art with meaning, I think it’s a great tool, especially for assisting in the art making process,” Glusic said. 
AI is now set to transform the industry. 
“With technology consistently progressing, I think AI has the potential to create some really unique pieces. Whether on its own, or as an aid to artists, I think AI art is continuing to expand and it’s better to work with it versus against it,” Glusic said. 
The question of whether people will eventually accept utilizing AI in art is raised by the way that the technology seems to advance on a daily basis.
“I foresee this happening commercially rather than people using it for art they are otherwise creating for pleasure. But like I said before, I definitely believe that there will be a point in time in which artificial intelligence will begin to put people in the design industry out of a job,” Moffa said. 
It is redefining how artists look at the industry. 
“Everyone can interpret art differently, but I am open to seeing how AI art develops,” Glusic said.

On Feb. 6, 2023, AMC Theaters introduced their newest initiative to moviegoers called the “Sightline at AMC” experience. The international company announced new ticket policies and some of the ways this will affect viewers’ enjoyment have been highlighted. 
This modern experience of seeing movies will propose buyers with different ticket prices based on where and when they choose to sit in the theater. The selection will be broken up into three different categories of seating which are Value Sightline, Standard Sightline, and Preferred Sightline. Each of these categories represents a different location in the theater and the prices will match accordingly. In their global press release, AMC Theaters took the time to break down this initiative and what it means exactly. 
“Standard Sightline seats are the most common in auditoriums and are available for the traditional cost of a ticket; Value Sightline seats are primarily in the front row of the auditorium and are available at a lower price than Standard Sightline seats; Preferred Sightline seats are typically in the middle of the auditorium and cost slightly more than Standard and Value Sightline seats,” AMC Theatres said in a press release. 
AMC is titled the largest theatrical exhibitor in the United States and this news hit movie lovers across the globe. 
For young people, the movie theater experience is already dying and this new policy can be seen as a hurtful blow to the entire industry. 
“Yeah, I like going to the movies and I like the communal experience of it all but I think this would definitely affect my trips to the movies,” senior film student Matthew King said. “If AMC goes ahead and implements this policy I would probably go to another theater that doesn’t have this type of pricing policy. I think a whole new policy of prices just based on the best seat location is nonsense. It would deter people from going to movies all together and just further promote home streaming services.”
Many movie lovers and theater goers alike share the same type of responses. Over the past few years, the film industry has seen a massive surge in home streaming services and individuals’ reliability on them. Due to this growth in popularity, viewers’ enjoyment around the movie theater experience have already been limited. Upon the company’s global news announcement, AMC’s executives have flocked to try and expose the benefits of “Sightline Seating.”
“Sightline at AMC more closely aligns AMC’s seat pricing approach to that of many other entertainment venues,” EVP and CMO of AMC Theatres Eliot Hamlisch said. “While every seat at AMC delivers an amazing moviegoing experience, we know there are some moviegoers who prioritize their specific seat and others who prioritize value moviegoing. Sightline at AMC accommodates both sentiments to help ensure that our guests have more control over their experience, so that every trip to an AMC is a great one.”
Today, the entertainment industry serves as many individuals’ source for relaxation, rest, and down time enjoyment. With the introduction of a policy like this, movie goers are forced to stress all viable options in the situation. They’re left to explore what this means for them exactly and how the movie theater experience may look in the near future. 
“Personally, when it comes to buying movie tickets, I’m a ‘$5 Tuesday’ kinda girl. I do like going to the movies but usually only when I see something that piques my interest like if a movie is made by my favorite director or actor,” junior film major Jada Smith said. “I usually pick the same row every single time because it’s right in the middle and I can see [in] row C, so a rule like this is extremely annoying for me. Honestly it’s very frustrating because not only do we already pay so much to go to the movies but to eat too– It makes you not want to go because what’s the point if you aren’t even going to be in an enjoyable spot?”
Many moviegoers have been faced with similar realizations to the company’s press release. As the largest theatrical exhibitor in the U.S., AMC has potential to change the entire movie screening experience. This policy is foreseen to spread across other major companies and further solidify this change in the movie theater experience forever. 
Moviegoers are far from pleased with this projected trend in pricing of tickets.
“If movie prices keep getting raised I think theaters will lose a lot of business to the much easier route of streaming services like they already have. Why pay extra for a seat you don’t really want when you can have the best seat in the house, right in front of your TV?” Smith said. 
Since the public was exposed to AMC’s new “Spotlight Seating,” there have been global reactions to the news. This Sightline initiative is AMC Theatre’s latest trial to experiment with movie ticket prices as cinemas still struggle to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moviegoers have already heard the policy change and have taken to the internet with heated backlash. This negative feedback has been fired at AMC Theaters across most social media platforms even including insights from Twitter’s CEO, Elon Musk. 
“The movie theater is and always has been a sacred democratic space for all and this new initiative @AMCTheatres would essentially penalize people for lower income and reward for higher income,” Lord of the Rings star and Academy Award Winning actor Elijah Wood wrote. Wood later tweeted back at the global company, “Wouldn’t it be nice to keep it this way?”
As things stand, AMC will be going ahead with the policy and a press release from the company specified that these rules will be in place every day after 4 p.m. and will not be available on “Discounts Tuesdays” effective immediately in select locations and eventually in all locations by the end of the year.

Hi, I especially wanted to say I loved your blog and how well-curated it was. AMC roku can be a difficult topic to cover on the internet solely because of a lot of misleading information. I am very glad your article is down to earth and very informative. Kudos and keep up the good work.

American art collective MSCHF, based in Brooklyn, NY, came out with a big red boot that seems to resemble the ones worn by the Japanese anime character “Astro Boy.” These boots retail for $350 and have been going viral on social media for their unique and silly appearance.  
Students on campus had similar impressions of the boots.
“I think they are very very interesting and they are big and red just like the name of them,” senior sports management major Ivan Jara expressed. “I personally wouldn’t wear them and I have personally never seen anything like them, but they are very unique boots.”
Sophomore education and psychology major Yaneila Fernandez shared her aligning opinion.
“I think they are definitely unique, but I do think they are taking advantage of what is going on [in fashion] right now,” Fernandez said. “I was previously discussing with someone how Lil Uzi Vert wore clown shoes on the [2023] Grammy red carpet.”
The shoes Fernandez is referring to are by the Spanish fashion brand Balenciaga.
There is no doubt that the underlying word to describe these shoes is unique. The goofy look of the boots is part of a whole new up-and-coming era of “silly” fashion. An era of fashion that doesn’t take itself too seriously and allows lots of room for creativity.
Junior fashion merchandising major Anna Johnson shared her take on this arising era of fashion.
“I think it’s interesting. I think sometimes, luxury fashion especially, has the tendency to take itself too seriously and puts itself on a level of superiority but I think adding some comedy to it and a level of absurd makes it a little more relatable and takes it down a few pegs almost,” Johnson voiced. “In the fashion industry at this point, there is nothing new, it’s all just recycled and updated looks from the past and I think there’s always going to be people who try and challenge that as much as possible and try to generate what is going to be the next big thing in this coming age.” 
However, along with this “silly” era of fashion comes a level of impracticality. The garments aren’t necessarily staple wear and some don’t even seem like they should be worn off the runway. 
That being said, Post students gave their outtakes on what they think designers are trying to achieve with this type of wear.
“I mean I don’t think fashion has to be comfortable all the time,” Fernandez expressed. “Designers are artists and they are trying to put their creative outlook on the world through their clothing so obviously if there is a runway show or if it’s [clothing] to explicitly take pictures of, it doesn’t necessarily have to be comfortable that type of fashion already exists, like athleisure. When fashion designers are creating things like [these designers] are portraying, they are creating something unique from their mind and that is something special.” 
Jara gave more of a simplistic take by summing it up in two words. 
“Be different,” he said. 
The fashion trend cycle comes into play when we talk about these new eras of fashion. A cycle that appears to be getting faster and faster with access to social media where new material gets sifted in and out by the day. 
Jara shared his views of the fashion trend cycle.
“Fashion changes every day, new things come up every day, even things from the past come up and come back and I think it’s really interesting to watch but it’s hard to follow,” he commented. 
Johnson gave more of an environmentalist standpoint on the trend cycle.
“It can be detrimental to the environment so I don’t like [the trend cycle] all the time. I think it’s fun to get new looks in, it gives designers a lot of room to kind of experiment and bring new stuff to the table, but yeah I hate how that allows a lot of room for waste.” 
With the fast pace of the trend cycle and bringing it back to the impracticality of “silly” clothing, specifically the big red boots, we see a huge environmental issue surface. Because the boots are almost entirely made to take photos in, they may be thrown out or resold within as little as two months. 
This reiterates the waste factor that Johnson touched on. She continued with her environmental viewpoint with regard to the big red boots. 
“There are so many people just wearing things once because it’s like a shock factor almost. I think that mindset can be hard because I definitely fall on the total opposite of that spectrum. I’m a total outfit repeater. I love using the same pieces multiple times and having more staples in my closet personally. I think from an artistic standpoint it’s fun to have certain outfits or models take things out and about to generate conversation and spark inspiration. [However,] in the long term it’s not something that people should make into a bigger trend,” she added. 
Fernadez gave some good advice on these kinds of purchases being a lover of the environment herself.
“I think for consumers it’s just very important to really think about, especially [when it comes to] expensive purchases, are you going to use this long term? If you are, are you gonna use it consistently? If it’s not comfortable, how will you use it? Just be very logical about your purchases, especially with the environmental state our earth is in right now,” she said.
Without considering any environmental or monetary factors, students shared their thoughts on whether they would ever consider owning a pair of the big red boots.
“Yes, just to have them, but I would never wear them. I would resell them for more money because I know they are sold out and in high demand,” Jara said.
Fernandez shared a similar opinion.
“Personally, I don’t think I would purchase them. I don’t like colors. I wear a lot of black. If the boots were in black and I was doing some type of photoshoot I would buy the boots. The size isn’t so much an inconvenience, it’s more the color but that’s my specific preference,” she said.
Johnson reiterated the point of the boldness and flashiness of the shoe being a drawback.
“Well, I will say I don’t know if they fit my personal style. Maybe if they were in black and they weren’t super expensive but like no. They’re giving mickey mouse and I just don’t know if that’s my vibe,” she said.
The boots are currently sold out on the MSCHF website but are available for purchase on numerous online second-hand markets.

As seen in the media lately, four unidentified balloon objects have been seen and shot down in the U.S between Jan. 23, 2023, to now, the end of February. 
There are multiple speculations surrounding the origin and purpose of the balloon. It first entered Alaska on Jan. 23 and crossed the country for an entire week before getting shot down, which can be seen all throughout the media including TikTok. 
U.S. officials claim that the balloon passed through western Alaska, the Aleutian Islands to the south, water into southwest Canada, and finally over Montana, before eventually being shot down near North Carolina. Americans are concerned about why it had taken so long for the president to decide to shoot it down. ABC News as well as other news sources state that military advisers in the U.S. said the balloon was too dangerous to shoot down due to the region it was in and the debris that would’ve been difficult to retrieve, which could have been a threat of casualties on the ground.  
Forbes says that the U.S has been tracking these balloons back to when they left China, meaning the federal government was aware of these balloons about a week earlier than the public. 
”While I think the balloon could have been shot down sooner, I understand that the decision to take down the spy balloon at the time they did mitigated the risk of harming people and property. Ultimately, I have to trust that the people we elect have the best interest of the general public in mind when they make decisions like this, understanding that they have more knowledge on the matter,” freshman finance major Grant Tredinnick said.
China stated the balloons were just carrying out weather research. However, U.S. officials have said the intent of the balloon was for surveillance instead.
It was said by China that the balloon was on course to fly toward Guam, but took an unexpected turn north to the U.S due to strong winds. Another balloon from China was found in Costa Rica soon after. China apologized for the scare and insisted it was for scientific research. 
Soon after the incident, China tried reversing the roles by accusing the United states of sending surveillance balloons to them, which the government had quickly denied. 
Between Friday, Feb. 10, and Sunday, Feb. 12, three unidentified objects were shot down, but the White House says there’s no indication of Chinese ownership. Many people are skeptical about the information the government is providing citizens about the situation.
“Reports have said that the information these objects could have collected is also obtainable from space satellites, so I don’t believe the balloons were meant to gather new information,” Tredinnick said.
Forbes also states that the Pentagon had recently stated that they have recovered a significant amount of technology debris from these balloons, which is the size of approximately three school buses. 
With this come those who believe there is something extraterrestrial going on with these objects. Some are convinced that aliens are sending them from afar, hiding in them, and even identifying these balloons as UFOs.  
“I’m not sure what the reason for the balloons are but I’m sure it’s not a positive one,” freshman musical theatre major Lauren Dunn stated.
Whichever story you believe about these objects, many feel that there’s no doubt something odd is going on. This situation has been going on for a few weeks now and citizens are still left with many questions and concerns.

On Feb. 16, 2023, Post hosted its second Multicultural Greek Exposition of the academic year. Fourteen Latinx and Black fraternities and sororities were present. The Inclusion and Equity Council (IEC) brought the event to life. The IEC is dedicated to upholding Post’s diversity, inclusion and equity values. 
“This is an exposition that involves many historically |Black and Latinx organizations. They are coming to share their history and perform a stroll, a step, or a march. Those are actions performed by these specific sororities and fraternities that indicate who they are. They can tell a story. It depends on each organization as to how they take a step. Mainly they are perceived as performance and dance. But there is a lot of meaning behind them,” Promise and Diversity coach Princess Henderson said.
In multicultural Greek organizations, members have their signature movements such as strolls and steps. Strolling symbolizes the bond that members within a Greek organization have. It is characterized as a synchronized dance or performance. Its establishment is accredited to Alpha Kappa Alpha, who strolled for the first time in the 1920s. From there, many other African American greek organizations began creating their own strolls. It is heavily linked to South African culture, dating back to the 19th century. 
Stepping is another dance performed by historically Black sororities and fraternities. It involves synchronized stomping and moving to the sound they create. Performers clap their hands, slap parts of their bodies and perform other specific movements. Stepping gained popularity among Black Greek organizations in the 1940s and 1950s. The dance took inspiration from performances by musical groups like The Temptations and The Four Tops. 
“At the event, each organization will have time to speak on their history. They will tell you about the philanthropy, and why they joined and then will perform. At the end of the event, you will have the chance to meet them,” Henderson said. “If you are interested in any of the attending organizations, you will be able to scan a QR code to let them know. If the organizations receive a lot of interest, they will be invited back to LIU to table or do more activities and programs so that people can eventually join. Multicultural organizations at LIU Post would be extremely beneficial. Not everyone wants to join the groups offered here, but are forced to since they don’t see a sorority or fraternity that they necessarily resonate with. Instead of getting exactly what they want, many people have to settle.” 
Students feel that fostering a diverse and inclusive environment is increasingly pivotal in educational settings, and helps students grow to be more well-rounded and open-minded. 
“I’m one of the only Black people and sometimes the only, black person in all of my classes, and it’s uncomfortable at times,” freshman art major Amor Galara said.
Other students agree, and feel that exposure to people with different backgrounds allows students to expand or accommodate their existing knowledge of cultures and societies.
“It’s always nice to see yourself and others with similar backgrounds represented,” freshman major Allison Elliott said. “Post may claim to have diversity, but we never feel the diversity when we’re the only people of color in a class or in any other spaces and our backgrounds aren’t being acknowledged or seen when the rest of the country, maybe even world, is supposedly so focused on acknowledging the existence and important contributions of POC and other groups.”
Students feel that those in diverse colleges are able to formulate a more accurate and positive paradigm towards different groups of people through friendship and collaboration. 
“To prepare for this event, I had to reach out to all the Long Island chapters for all the organizations coming. We contacted a lot of alumni that were at our last expo. Of course, we had to contact Krasnoff theater and the Tilles center to make sure we have the space. We worked with Promise to make sure we have the resources and manpower to do it. A lot of the organizations performing used to be here. These groups want to come back. People just have to be interested. All we need is five eligible undergraduate members with at least a 2.5 GPA,” junior veterinarian tech major Kaitlyn Cucolo, the Greek Chair of the IEC, said about the event. 
Cucolo hopes the event will lead to more inclusion for these organizations.
“This event is for D9s and NALFOS (National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations). The D9s, or divine nines, are the Black sororities and fraternities. The NALFOS are the Hispanic and Latinx sororities and fraternities. Hopefully, we can bring them to this campus. We can revive them at this campus or create a new chapter. SUNY Old Westbury, St. Johns, Stony Brook and LIU Brooklyn are coming, and some other schools. Many of the organizations coming are graduates trying to revive their chapters,” Cucolo said. “The bond created when you join a sorority or frat can’t be broken. Especially with multicultural ones. You are with people who can actually relate to you and know what you go through as a person of color. Know what it’s like navigating the world we live in today. It’s so important, especially in today’s political and social climate.” 
The first organization to perform was the Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity (LSU). LSU was founded in 1979 when Latino students at Rutgers University felt that they were not receiving enough attention in order to succeed in their studies. Students protested the insufficient attention from the university by taking over university facilities and participating in campus sit-ins. When students met up, they shared ideas and planned the creation of an organization that would cater to the Latino student population. Weeks later, the LSU fraternity was founded. The motto for the fraternity is “Latinos Siempre Unidos,” or Latinos Always United in English. 
The Nu Omega Chi Fraternity had an upbeat strolling performance. The organization was founded on Feb. 8, 2013 at Brooklyn College.. The organization’s four core values are honor, loyalty, respect and tradition. They would like to uplift their community, promote brotherhood and achieve nothing but greatness. Their philanthropy is sickle cell disease awareness. As a predominantly Black organization, they take initiative in informing people in their community about this disease that occurs in 1 in 365 Black or African American births. 
Following LSU’s performance was Hermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha (SIA). SIA was founded on Sept. 29, 1990 in New York by 13 Latina college students. Their mission is to uphold the goals set forth by their 13 founding mothers. They pledge to create bonds amongst each other as sisters and abide by respect, trust, communication, professionalism and accountability. They also focus on spreading awareness of Latino culture. Through the bonds of sisterhood, they develop leadership, scholarship, sportsmanship and friendship. 
Nicole Calderon of SIA spoke after the event.
“I’m a sister or Hermana of Hermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha Incorporada. We are a Latina-based organization, but not exclusive. We welcome all women. We love to support women academically, professionally and socially. One thing about SIA that I’ll say brought me to it is that I felt like I could be myself,” Calderon said. “I’m this weirdo goofball and they accept me and it was a place where I felt like it was okay to be different. Like look at us, we’re all different. We have a sister from NYIT Old Westbury whose family is from the Philippines. We have sisters from Latin American countries, Haiti and China. It’s so amazing to see us all come together.”
The MALIK fraternity returned to campus and participated at the Greek Exposition. Their Founders, referred to as Crowns, grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, a time in which people of color in the United States and abroad began to overtly express the pride they had in their race and culture. The organization was heavily influenced by Malcolm X’s work and activism. 
The Phi Beta Sigma fraternity was established in 1914 at Howard University in Washington D.C. It was created by three male students who thought an organization that truly exemplified the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship and service was necessary at their campus. They believed that members should be perceived by their morals instead of their economic status, family background, race, skin tone or texture of hair. The organization emphasizes the importance of giving back to its community through service. 
If you are interested in joining and bringing a Multicultural Greek Organization to Post, you can communicate with Princess Henderson or Gabrielle Barone, the fraternity/sorority coordinator.

Senior musical theatre major Jordan Coene knew exactly what she wanted to be when she grew up. 
“In fifth grade, everyone in my class was asked on video what we wanted to be when we grew up for our moving up ceremony. All of the other kids said normal answers such as fireman, or doctor, or even astronaut. Then, they got to me and I said “[I want to be] a princess!” I definitely stuck to my word. I now get to call myself a professional princess and CEO of my very own company, which is an achievement I am extraordinarily grateful for,” Coene said. 
During the peak of COVID-19 in 2020, Coene started to realize that if she was lonely and stuck at home, she couldn’t imagine how young children were feeling. 
“They were unable to go to school, extracurriculars, parties and even playdates with friends. So, I ordered my first costume and did socially distanced and mask-free doorstep meet and greet visits with the kids to bring their spirits up,” Coene said. 
The children were in awe of Coene and seeing a princess at their door during such a difficult time was a boost of joy. This is when she decided to make a business out of it. 
“Once Upon A Daydream Parties, LLC is a character entertainment company that brings your favorite characters straight from their fairy tales and stories into parties and events across Long Island, NY,” she said. 
Her business, Once Upon a Daydream Parties, has grown tremendously over the last couple of years. She now has over 50 magical performers to attend a variety of events. The company has a rotating cast of summer actors, school-year actors and holiday carolers. The audition process is fairly straightforward.
“Our auditions are held through Zoom. We ask anyone who is interested to send a headshot, resume and full body shot to our email, onceuponadaydreamparties@gmail.com. We then set up a virtual audition with them. From there, we ask them to prepare a song and have a small improvisational section to the audition as well. As a callback, we meet with the performers in person and have a costume fitting,” Coene said.
While it’s not easy to be a prince or princess, the audition process for Once Upon a Daydream Parties is quick and to the point. Coene has it down to a science now that she’s been casting performers for over two years. In the time that her business has been running, she has achieved astounding accomplishments.
“One of my biggest accomplishments as a business owner was just hitting our two year anniversary as an LLC last month. We had a huge company photoshoot at a catering hall and were able to bond as a company all together and share the love for our job. In addition, we have been nominated in multiple categories two years in a row for the Bethpage Best of LI contest,” she said. 
While Coene may make it look easy, owning and running a business while also being a full-time student is not always a breeze. As a theatre student, navigating the business side of her company was a bit of a struggle. 
“Some of the biggest challenges I’ve faced so far is learning the business side of owning a business as I go. When I first started this journey, I had no idea I was going to become an LLC, and therefore a CEO. I also had no idea my company would grow as big and as fast as it did.”
Luckily, Coene feels like she has a fantastic support system.
“I’m very grateful for my parents who are helping to teach me all of the paperwork and financial sides of business –as my father is a business owner as well– so I can be a successful company,” she said. 
Over two years of memories have accumulated for Coene and her successful business.
“One of my fondest memories as a business owner was watching the first event that I was assisting and not in character for. It was so rewarding to see my incredible performers have such a love and passion for their job. The way they jump into the roles and do it for the love of the magic and the kids truly warms my heart. I will admit I did start to tear up. As a performer, I always experienced some of my favorite memories first hand through interactions with adults and kids, but watching it from the outside was truly a remarkable and proud moment for me.”
With her business still booming, it is important that customers book as soon as possible for the date/party they need. For more information, check out the Once Upon a Daydream Parties website at onceuponadaydreamparties.com and social media pages like Instagram @onceuponadaydreamparties , Facebook Once Upon a Daydream Parties LLC, or contact via email at onceuponadaydreamparties@gmail.com.

Up until this week, Long Island has seen no measurable snow so far this winter. We have seen below-freezing temperatures, but where’s the snow? 
According to the weather forecast for Nassau County, the snowiest periods would have been from mid-December to mid-January. However, we saw little to no snow during those times.
The National Weather Service’s predictions for January to March gave New York City between a 40 and 50 percent chance to see warmer-than-normal conditions. This prediction seems to align with what we are seeing here on the Island. Though we have seen freezing temperatures, warmer and rainy weather has been more consistent. 
Despite snow being a controversial topic, students on campus are disappointed with the lack of snow because they actually enjoy snow days. 
“I am a fan of snow days,” sophomore nursing major Grace Hennig expressed. “I actually live upstate so I’m very familiar with having snow days and it’s been weird being here because there’s no snow, only rain, but I love snow days, the days off from school were the best.”
“I loved snow ever since I was little because obviously, you get to play in the snow. I have so many memories of me and my friends and my brother and sister going sledding, building snowmen, getting off from school because of the snow, and all that fun stuff. I [also] love being cozy like just sitting and watching the snow fall with hot cocoa. Love it,” sophomore nursing major Matiana Valdez said. 
Long Island natives are surprised to see a winter without at least one blizzard. 
“I think it’s definitely odd, especially because I’m from here we usually get one big snowstorm or at least a few days [of snow]. It’s definitely also peculiar because the groundhog said there would be six more weeks of winter and I haven’t seen much of that, “ junior education major Jill Meaney stated. 
Valdez, who is also a Long Island native, feels similarly. 
“I think it’s kinda concerning considering the fact that it used to snow a lot, especially when I was younger. We would have multiple blizzards a winter and now we have little to no snow at all so I think that’s pretty interesting.” 
This warmer winter makes it difficult for some to ignore the topics of climate change and global warming. However, it could also just be similar to warmer winters that Long Island has had in the past.
For the most part, Post students are concerned with the impacts of climate change on the winter we are experiencing. However, they do find some points to counteract that notion.
“I mean I am definitely worried about [the warmer winter] because I’ve noticed it has been getting a little warmer and I think we as a society can do a lot more to help out and I feel like we always just push climate change to the side. I’m also thinking about the location and I know Long Island is not very known for snow and I mean it has been pretty cold,” Hennig voiced. 
Meaney does feel similarly but expresses a little less concern.
“I’m not one to bring up climate change, but I am a little nervous about it. As of right now, we have had a mix of some cold days so I’m not too worried.”
Nonetheless, it is a bit skeptical that we haven’t seen snow this winter considering snow days have seen consistency in the past. But as Meaney stated, “the groundhog said there would be six more weeks of winter,” so maybe there are still chances for some snow in the near future.
