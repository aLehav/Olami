Halfway through the spring semester, Blackboard, the internet based course system that many professors use to post assignments and announcements, is still undergoing maintenance issues that were present last semester and previous semesters. While the site is designed to help students stay up to date with assignments, view their grades, and take quizzes, the constant maintenance issues hurt the site’s overall purpose. Over the last three years, seven announcements have been posted on Blackboard that informed students and professors of the site’s unavailability, in addition to maintenance updates not posted on the site. These announcements can be viewed on Blackboard by clicking on the “Announcements” tab on the “My LIU” page. These issues range from general maintenance to login errors to a temporary service interruption that took place both during and after the end of the semester.
While students are advised to check Blackboard every day to stay up to date on their classes, sophomore broadcasting major Andrew Frank stated that he will only check the site if a professor utilizes it and talks about it in class. “Overall, I feel that the site does its job well but it’s more so on the professors who [are] not keeping it updated. There are certain subjects where a professor will constantly update the page and overload it with assignments and then there are other subjects where it will be ignored for the whole semester.” Sophomore game design major Joseph Migliara echoes Frank’s statements, stating that Blackboard “consists of extra information the professor might go over but it really depends on the course and who is teaching it.”
Migliara, Frank, and junior broadcasting major Paul Evans each stated that they check Blackboard three or four times a week. They each stated that they have had multiple instances where they needed to check Blackboard in order to complete an assignment or check grades and were unable to do so. “One time I needed to check Blackboard to download some review papers but I couldn’t access the site. I don’t know if I was the only student who couldn’t access it or if the whole system was down; there was no scheduled maintenance update,” Frank said. Evans stated that there is a clear separation between the students who access and don’t access Blackboard. “The students who check Blackboard on a regular basis usually graduate on time while the students who go through the entire semester without checking it don’t graduate,” he said.
When asked what improvements he would like to see made to Blackboard, Migliara stated that he would like to see the app have more of a purpose. “I’d like to get a notification on my phone whenever there is a maintenance update or one of my professors posts something new on the class page.”
Students and professors have had a mixed reaction to Blackboard since it launched on campus and those reactions are still present today. The Pioneer has previously reported about this in 2011 and 2014. Jon-Paul McCaffrey, the Assistant Director of the Information Technology Resource Center, did not address the Pioneer’s inquiries about the disruptions, but instead directed the Pioneer to the main IT department in the library. Representatives in the main IT department stated that no one was available to respond to questions at this time about service outages or maintenance updates on Blackboard this semester.

Sociology professor Brian Sweeney will lead a 3 credit study abroad course in Reykjavik, Iceland from June 3-13. All students are eligible to apply to fill fifteen spots in Sweeney’s first international course.
During the trip, students will go “ Visit the National Museum of Iceland and Þingvellir (pronounced thingveller) National Park (the centuries-old site of Icelandic democracy), attend talks by the University of Iceland sociologists and political scientists on topics including income inequality in Iceland, the Icelandic healthcare system, the Icelandic political system, and the great Icelandic banking collapse of 2008, visit mental health care agencies, a Muslim immigration organization, and a gender-equality-themed kindergarten,” according to the trip info site http://liuiceland. weebly.com. Students will also go on the Golden Circle Tour and the South Coast Waterfall tour, where they will see “natural and historic attractions” such as natural water explosions known as geysers.
Sweeney teaches Sociology of Human Sexuality, Sociology of Men and Masculinity, and introductory sociology courses. “These classes I’m teaching now do relate to the trip.” The timing seems right for a trip like this with the ongoing news of the Trump administration, Sweeney said. “A lot of Americans don’t believe the federal government should play much of a role in education. Places like Iceland can offer a very different model for how the government can play a role in society. The Nordic people have more trust in the government and a lot of Americans are mistrustful of the government.”
Iceland is a “very natural fit” due to Sweeney’s personal and professional connections to the country. His friends there are a mix of sociologists and scientists who share the same interest in the comparison of the two cultures, mindsets, and governance. “It’s a very different place in terms of what Icelanders they think about equality, how are concerned about, how they think about opportunity.”
Sweeney said that countries such as Iceland utilize their opportunity to experience upward mobility, allowing the numbers between the rich and the poor to be much smaller than that of the United States. Icelanders are “shocked” by the Trump administration’s efforts to minimize the government and dismantle Obamacare, as their constitution says everybody should have access to quality health care, according to Sweeney.
Sessions during the trip will be given by two of Sweeney’s friends, Professors Gunnar Bernberg and Sigrun Olafsdottir, sociologists at the University of Iceland. Along with providing information on their own research in “comparative politics” about government styles and health outcomes, they will be very much a part of the trip, helping Sweeney coordinate trip activities.
Junior dance major, Emily Bivona is applying for the study abroad opportunity and, if chosen, will use the credit as an elective. “Professor Sweeney spoke to my Soc. 3 class and sparked my interest in applying,” Bivona said. “I’ve always wanted to take up the opportunity to study abroad which is difficult to coordinate with my major during the fall and spring semesters. The summer would be perfect for my situation.”
“Iceland is a really fascinating and easy place to travel,” says Sweeney. “It’s relatively close, not as far as mainland Europe; actually not as far as California. It is strikingly beautiful and is geographically and geologically fascinating to explore.”
Fifteen spots are available and applications are being accepted through May 1. The trip will count as credit for sociology, political science, or an elective. For students in the Honors College, it can count as an advanced honors elective. There is no prerequisite to apply for the trip. Students can log onto http://liuiceland.weebly.com for more information. To apply, visit http://liu.edu/study-abroad to fill out the “Faculty-Led Study Abroad application”. Following this trip there will be The Transition Economies of Central Europe and the Former Soviet Union coarse led by the economics department, taking place in Slovenia, led by Veronika Dolar from July 1- 14.

On Feb. 24, over 100 students applying for resident assistant positions lined up in front of the Hillwood Cinema at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to sign in for the first round of interviews to fill the 23 to 25 RA positions. Following sign-in, candidates were separated into rooms 112 and 221 of Hillwood Commons, where they engaged in various group exercises before their individual interview. The interview process was about three hours long for both the morning and afternoon sessions.
Logan Dewitt, a junior musical theater major and RA for two consecutive years, was at the sign-in to hopefully be hired for his consecutive third year. This process was the same as the last two years that she has been interviewed for the position, she said.
This will be the second year RAs will also be required to hold positions as orientation leaders for the incoming fall freshmen. According to Dewitt, orientation leaders need to come back to campus for two weeks in the middle of the summer to train for orientation and then prepare students for their first semester. “There is going to be one orientation session,” Dewitt said. “Last year, [students] came early to school; this year they will be coming in the middle of the summer.”
Benefits to holding this position is a stipend for orientation and free room during the school year. Applicants are eliminated through each round of interviews and a few weeks following the final round students chosen will be contacted. It is not determined how many RAs will be returning. Building assignments will be given to RAs during the summer.

Students and professors who have classes in Humanities Hall Rooms 117 or 116 may have noticed a loud rumbling sound in those rooms, emanating from the mechanical room directly below those classrooms. The sound is clearly audible in those two rooms, and some are complaining about the noise.
“It’s terrible,” said Professor Veronika Dolar, who teaches an ECO 11 course in room 117 at 11 a.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays. “I feel like I always have to talk over it,” she said. Tyler McLaughlin, a senior broadcasting major who has CMA 10 class in the room at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, has also noticed the noise. “The noise in the classroom is really disruptive especially when you’re trying to focus,” he said. McLaughlin said he’d like the noise to be dealt with.
However, the Pioneer also reached out to other professors who teach in both rooms 117 and 116, Doug Augenthaler, Colby Valentine, Gale Kaplan, Kathleen Feeley, and Edmond Niemczura, all of whom said they did not notice a noise problem.
William Kirker, director of facilities services, noted he had not heard of any noise complaints prior to this. Upon hearing about this annoyance, though, he inspected the mechanical room below those two classrooms, and found that the noise is coming from two pumps in that room. “The pumps themselves are not making much noise,” he explained. “But they must be hitting a certain frequency that is causing the noise that is easily heard and aggravating to people.”
Kirker said that he will look into the two pumps to see if there may be a bearing that is starting to wear.

Over spring break, the dance department will take its annual trip to the American College Dance Association’s conference (ACDA), hosted this year by Morristown Community College in N.J. ACDA is an outstanding opportunity for dance majors to experience four days of dance classes in various styles throughout the morning and evening, and to partake in both adjudication and informal concerts. LIU Post’s dance department submits student work at the start of the spring semester. This year, two student choreographed works will be adjudicated at the conference. Selected dances are pieces choreographed by Amanda Ehrlich, a junior dance major, and Jeanelle Santiago, a senior dance major who will be attending her last ACDA this spring.
Santiago’s piece, titled, “1 Corinthians 15:33” is three minutes of contemporary dance to the song “Someday” by Olafur Arnalds. The concept for the piece came from Santiago’s life experiences. “It is about having negative and just bad people in your life that may seem to be good for you but slowly take a toll on you emotionally and physically,” Santiago said. “In the end, you become sick of it and finally let those people go.” Santiago tends to make her choreography about relatable topics. Pulling some movement from her modern dance class taught by Beth Trimm, Santiago choreographed the whole piece, and Cheryl Halliburton, former Co-Director of Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC) who retired last spring, mentored her throughout the process.
The piece is being performed in front of dozens of other dancers, choreographers, and educators. Dancers include department juniors Katelyn Cotto, Emily Bivona, Amanda Ehrlich, Alex Mitchell, a senior, and Ana Lynch-Comer, a freshman.
“I am excited to hear [the adjudicators’] wisdom regarding the piece,” Santiago said. “It is all constructive criticism and it’s only going to strengthen my choreography.” Santiago said the feedback will help when choreographing her new piece for the Spring PCDC Diversity show in April.
Ehrlich is also eager to hopefully receive positive feedback along with critiques to help her improve her piece entitled “Where the Wild Things Are” danced to the Novo Amor cover of “Welcome to the Jungle” by Guns N’ Roses’. “I created this piece to show how important it is to express your individuality and uniqueness regardless of what society tells you,” Ehrlich said. Inspired by the quote, “In a society that profits from your self doubt, liking yourself is a rebellious act,” Ehrlich worked closely with freshman Johnnier Fenner, sophomores Mary Cate Bottenus and Lauren Hiraldo, junior Gabrielle Amico, and seniors Sharayah Spruill and Ernest Williams. “This is a group of 6 hardworking dancers have been so inspiring to work with all semester.”
“During the adjudication, it’s good to see where we stand with other departments in the region,” Gabrielle Amico, a junior dance major who is attending ACDA for the third time this year, said. The opportunity to perform, learn, and witness multiple forms of dance at ACDA doesn’t come free. Most of the college groups that attend are there with full university funding. The fee for attending ACDA is $125 per student,- not including the additional $100 for food. For the LIU Post dancers, the registration fee, transportation and hotel rooms will be covered through money that they have raised throughout the year.
PCDC students have put together several fundraisers throughout the school year to support their trip. Headed by Jennifer O’Neill, a senior dance major, the fundraisers included a bake sale, a comedy show at Governor’s Comedy Club, selling Yankee Candles, and selling treats at PCDC shows. “We are always successful,” O’Neill said. “It wouldn’t be possible without the help of our PCDC supporters.”
Last year, when ADCA was hosted in Buffalo, the dance department had rented the LIU van and approximately four students drove for 8 hours there and back, with other students providing their own transportation. “It’s really unsafe,” Amico said. “I just don’t understand why they couldn’t provide us a bus and a driver.”
The school dance team, a club funded by the athletic department, not through an academic unit, travels to national competitions, with plane tickets, hotel rooms, and registration expenses paid for by the university. “Dance team gets more support than the actual dance majors,” Diamond Avant, a junior dance major, said.
Despite the lack of financial support for the trip, what is most important to the dance department is the students’ passion for expressing themselves through dance. “We’ve all worked hard to make a good name for our department,” Avant said.

The Sustainability Club, which changed its name to the Coalition for Conservation this semester, is in the process of starting a campus farm. The club has a small plot of garden space near the Public Safety building on the east side of campus, which they will soon be tilling to prepare to plant the seedlings.
Vic DiVenere, associate professor in the department of earth & environmental science, will be leading the club in preparing the plot, planting, and tending the vegetables. According to DiVenere, the club should be harvesting a variety of greens later in the semester. The club is already growing an array of produce in the campus greenhouse, including, snap peas, cilantro, basil, zinnia, Mexican sun flowers, snapdragons, cosmos, arugula, mesclun, swiss chard, kale, spinach, radishes, lettuce, mustard, parsley, and rosemary. Those seeds will eventually be transported to the outside plot. The club spent over two months planning and collecting the materials for the project and had two soil sifting sessions,where they sift the soil to remove any excess debris to get the soil ready for planting, in the greenhouse before they planted the seeds.
“The club is an eye opening opportunity for students to really see how their actions affect the world we live in, and our goal is to offer experiences and hands on lessons on how to become more sustainable. We want LIU to become more sustainable and the farm is one of the first steps were taking,” Alexandra Wise, a freshman double majoring in marketing and environmental science and vice president of the club said.
“We really want to see this [the farm] expand into a larger portion of the school and we hope that through our success this semester, we will be able to expand in the coming years,” Erica Ferrara, president of the club and a freshman geology and environmental sustainability major, said.
The club’s long term goal is to expand the campus farm to the point where the club would have a few acres and be growing all year round. “I hope in the future, with sufficient interest, to ask for a larger, dedicated farm plot and have a regular vegetable production schedule. Then, students can market the produce,” DiVenere said.
“One obvious outlet to pursue would be an agreement with Aramark to provide vegetables for the campus, although we have no such agreement presently,” DiVenere said. Brian Yoli, the Food Service Director for Aramark, reacted positively to the club’s plans. “I have learned about plans that have been discussed for the coalition for conservation on campus. I think it is a really great idea,” he said, adding that 24 percent of the vegetables and fruits Aramark serves are grown locally. Aramark’s benchmark for locally grown products and ingredients is 20%, “We are above the norm and continue to implement new and exciting things to our menu,” Yoli stated.
“To be able to use the vegetables and fruits grown right here on campus is a really neat idea, however there are a lot of channels that we will need to go through to get there. There are variances with the health department as well as the USDA and insurance that we must go through to get proper certification to get the program going. When you go out to eat as a consumer, you really don’t realize what is measured and evaluated. Each establishment goes through periodic inspections and several evaluations. There are so many regulations we must follow,” said Yoli.
“We are trying to provide students with alternate experiences on campus. We want students who are interested in farming, interested in growing or learning about food, or those who just want to get their hands dirty on [the] weekend to be able to get involved. This type of manual labor can be used as a stress reliever and is also a unique learning opportunity that many students don’t have,” Ferrara said. The club, which was formed in 2016 and currently has 28 members, focuses on a wide range of topics including recycling,   sustainable living, food, waste, and global warming.
“We want to represent a wide area of topics so we can have members who are all different and are passionate about different aspects of the Club,” Erica Ferrara, President of the club and a freshman geology and environmental sustainability major, said.
The club meets every Tuesday during common hour in Hillwood Commons, Room 221. Students interested in joining can email post-coc@my.liu.edu or e.ferrara@my.liu.edu.

Kelly Carey, a senior forensic science major, has figured out a way to balance an internship, cheerleading, and school. Carey has excellent grades, is captain of the cheerleading team, and has had an internship with one of the premier law enforcement agencies around the world her entire senior year.
Carey grew up in Holbrook. Her father worked with the NYPD and retired with the Nassau PD as a detective lieutenant, and her mother works for a pharmaceutical company, so Carey knew forensic science was in her blood. She started doing gymnastics at the age of three and continued for 10 years until deciding to switch to cheerleading. “Cheerleading became big in New York and I wanted to try something new,” Carey explained.
Growing up, Carey knew exactly what she wanted to be: an elementary school teacher. When she was a sophomore in high school, Carey had a special connection with her English teacher and thought she might want to be an English teacher instead, until the following year. In her junior year, Carey began watching shows such as “Criminal Minds” and “CSI,” which led to her discovering her love for forensic science.
In September 2013, Carey began her studies as a forensic science major, with a minor in chemistry. “The minor automatically comes with it, you just have to choose to claim it or not,” Carey said. Carey also made the cheerleading team her freshman year and was co-captain by her junior year.
Throughout her years on campus, Carey has excelled academically, making the dean’s list every semester. In summer 2016, Carey started an internship with the Department of Justice. “I’ve always wanted to work for them,” she said. Carey works side-by-side with DOJ employees, Suffolk County PD, and NYPD, among others, and she is exposed to different law enforcement positions. She was asked to continue her internship past the summer and is still interning today.
Carey is also captain of the cheerleading team; she is leading practices, organizing team fundraising events, and prepping the team for National Cheerleading Association’s Nationals held in Daytona, Florida on April 5-9. Gina Cammarata, a junior psychology major and fellow cheer-team member said, “Kelly is the most hard-working and dedicated person I know. She is able to balance cheerleading, an internship, and school with an amazing GPA.”
Carey is also the secretary of the Forensics Science Club on campus; the club voted her in at the end of the spring 2016 semester. Recently, Carey and eight other members of the club went to New Orleans for the American Academy of Forensic Sciences annual meeting. During the meeting, students attended lectures where professionals in the field presented research and interesting cases. The speakers gave students information and tools to help them become successful in the future.
After she graduates in May, Carey hopes to eventually achieve her dream job of working in the FBI Laboratory.

With midterms right around the corner, stress is inevitable for most students. College students have to juggle countless activities including school, work, a social life, clubs and health. It is no wonder that 31.8 percent of students nationally have reported that stress has directly affected their academic performance in the following ways, “received a lower grade on an exam, or an important project; received a lower grade in the course; received an incomplete or dropped the course; or experienced a significant disruption in thesis, dissertation, research, or practicum work,” according to the National College Health Assessment.
Although school can be stressful, there will always be ways to cope with that stress. Elisabeth Petry, a sophomore English major said, “I deal with stress in a number of ways some good, some bad. I find it very helpful when I’m stressing out to take a step back and recognize that what I’m stressed about is likely only temporary and there are always ways I can try to cope.”
Physical signs of stress can be rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, headache, sweating or sweaty palms. There are also signs of emotional stress like becoming irritable, finding it hard to concentrate or fearing the worst.
First thing’s first, in order to prevent or cope with stress, you should be fully aware of it. Ways to prevent stress can be scheduling meaningful activities like dancing, writing or hanging out with friends. Making time for relaxation is also important or else the constant stress and pressure may cause harm in the end. Lynne Schwartz, director of the center for healthy living, said another great way to cope with stress is, “looking into ways of managing stress whether it’s academic, I would go to the various tutoring and support services on campus. And then working on developing a support system, come to the center for healthy living, also talk to friends and family; there’s people around you that can help manage that stress if you reach out.”
Physical activities can also help cope with stress. Through deep-breathing exercises or meditation, relaxation can be achieved. The center for healthy living offers “Meditation Mondays” every Monday from 1:00 pm to 1:30 pm in Kahn. Exercise is also a powerful way to combat stress. It clears the mind and stimulates endorphins to make the body feel better. Exercise has been correlated to decreased anxiety and depression.
Nutrition is also essential to taking care of the body and preventing stress. Drinking chamomile tea helps alleviate stress and anxiety. For stomachaches and digestive troubles ginger tea calms the pain. If feeling the need for a pick-me-up, eat some oatmeal. Oatmeal contains complex carbohydrates and contributes to the release of serotonin, without causing a sugar crash.
If all else fails Schwartz says to, “Laugh, laugh, laugh, make yourself laugh. Find something funny. It stimulates the endorphins and makes you smile because it takes away some of the gunk in your head. ”

Two album releases by the same artist one week after another? Seems unlikely, right? Not so for rapper Future (born Nayvadius Wilburn). The 33 year-old Atlanta native released his self titled album “Future” digitally on Apple Music and other music platforms on Feb 17, 2017 and followed up with another full-length album titled “HNDRXX” just a week later. While the self-titled project featured more of the same from the trap-style rapper, “HNDRXX” strays a bit off the beat and path and is more R&B influenced than his last project (with some help of auto-tune and pitch correction, of course).
Future is known for his long stretches of consistent releases. He released three mixtapes (unofficial free albums) in 2015 and an album in 2016 with rap superstar Drake. After a lengthy tour with the Canadian rapper that spanned almost the entire United States, Future went back to work in the studio in preparation for another tour. In the music industry some may say “you’re only as good as your last hit record”. Luckily for Future, he has enough hit records to keep the royalty checks coming in for quite some time. With this type of work ethic, one begins to understand why Future (or “Super” as he sometimes calls himself) prefers to rap about the bundles of cash that he blows away on a seemingly everyday basis.
Aside from the typical subjects of drug use and a hardcore street upbringing, Future gives fans a sense of his vulnerable side on this album, speaking about his past relationship with R&B singer Ciara, and their child. The rapper’s cadence and flow on this album is something rap fans will appreciate. A lot of times with       hip-hop, what you say isn’t as important as how you say it. Of course, lyrics are a part of any great song, but the delivery Future brings on this album is a mix of aggressive and heartfelt. Even on the songs with a more melancholy feel, Future still manages to make it fun and braggadocios. “Gucci on sight / Rollie on ice,” Future raps, referencing his expensive designer handbag and his flashy Rolex watch.
The overall production and instrumentation on this album is something to highlight. Gone are the usual producer tags that come in right before the beat drops. Unless one looks at the credits, there are no audible production tags to be heard on this album. This gives the album a more clean, polished feel. Just because the producer’s names aren’t embedded in the songs doesn’t mean they don’t shine themselves. The beats are as polished and spacious as I’ve ever heard on a Future project, and that’s saying something when considering the talent that he has at his disposal. The instrumentals have a more experimental and dark feel to them, but differentiate themselves from what many rap fans are used to hearing from Atlanta at the moment.
Senior broadcasting major Drew Abrahams is a Future fan. “The fact that the guy released two albums in [two] weeks is unheard of,” he said. “On [this album] he is trying to show that he can go double platinum with no features,” he said. “I think he will”. “He showed how much he can do with his voice,” Abrahams said. “All he has to do is grunt, and it’s music,” he said.

The Chorus will be performing at the Tilles Choral Festival on Mar 22. The chorus, led by director Mark Shapiro, will be singing alongside various high school choirs and the event will end with a performance consisting of high school choirs and undergraduate college students, according to junior vocal performance major Veronica Nguyen. Four middle schools and/or high schools will be performing: Brentwood, Freeport, Francis Lewis, and Riverhead schools are expected to be in attendance. About 150 visitors are expected.
Junior music education major Kevin Ammann has been a member of the chorus for three years. Traditionally singing in the tenor section, Ammann will be switching things up for this performance along with the other tenors. “This time around, all the men are combined into one section and are termed ‘baritones’”.
As with any performance, much practice is required if one expects to perform at an optimal level. Ammann sees the rehearsal process for the concert as “interesting”.
“We start out by reading the music on a neutral syllable – “loo” or “doo” , Ammann said.
After discussing the harmonies in a specific piece, comes the more difficult aspect of the rehearsal. This is one of Amman’s favorite parts of the rehearsal process. “After [discussing harmonies], we start looking at the words,” he said. “This is the [fun part]… We try to distill the text into modern English.” The translation of the lyrics aren’t always obvious, but this can lead to some funny instances for the choir. “Dr. Shapiro does not tell us right away what the translation is and has students try to figure it out. This sometimes results in some very funny answers,” he said. The layout of the class is rather untraditional for a music class. The musicians all face one another in the class (think of one large roundtable). Shapiro sets up his class this way to encourage “eye contact with other singers [which is] not possible with our traditional concert set up,” Ammann said.
Senior music education major Kelli Shahinian has been with the chorus since her first semester of college, as a requirement to fulfill her major. Shahinian praises director Shapiro “He pushes us and demands us to seek a high level of musicianship,” she said. In addition, Shahinian enjoys The Coffeehouse element of the chorus performance. The Coffeehouse allows those in the chorus to show off their other musical talents to the audience. “In the past three years we had instrumentalists play their chamber music, we had another student perform a monologue from a Shakespearean play…It’s a great way for students to [showcase their talents],” she said. The coffeehouse performances will take place at the Apr 14 concert.
Catch the Chorus perform at Tilles Center on Mar 22 at 7:30 p.m. and see the Chorus and Chamber singers perform on Apr 14 at the Tilles Center starting at 8 p.m.

The men’s and women’s indoor track teams both placed fourth at the East Coast Conference Championships Feb. 24 at the Ocean Breeze Athletic Complex in Staten Island.
Three runners captured the league title in their respective events: junior Talya Williams won the mile with a time of 5:02.81, freshman Jeffrey Reyes won the 1,000 meter run with a time of 2:32.59, and senior Stefan Adams dominated the 500 meter dash with a time of 1:04.06, breaking the meet record by more than three seconds.
Head Coach Kevin Buckley said that Reyes had been dealing with “nagging injuries” all season, but with time to rest before the meet, he was confident in Reyes’ ability to perform at this meet. Each athlete who won their event automatically qualifies them for the ECAC/IC4A Championships in Boston on March 4.
Williams followed her victory in the mile with a third place finish in the 3,000-meter run. Graduate student Elizabeth Stirling and freshman Kaitlyn Klein both placed second in the 5,000-meter run and shot put, respectively, and freshman Nicole Costanzo cleared 1.50 meters to place second in high jump. Sara Stebbings finished fifth in high jump, and scored her first points this season for the Pioneers. Four runners placed fourth in their events: Stirling in the 3,000-meter run, freshman Alexandria Okon in the 500-meter dash, freshman Nicolette Agostinacchio in the 800-meter run, and graduate student Ashlin Conroy in the 1,000-meter run and the 5,000-meter run.
For the men, Adams followed his win in the 500-meter dash with a second place finish in the 200-meter dash. Sophomore Jermaine Ifill finished the 400-meter dash in third, and freshman Twary McKenzie also took third in the triple jump. The 4×400 team of Adams, Reyes, Ifill, and redshirt junior Kyle Ward ran a season best 3:23.25 to place second.
Buckley told the Pioneer earlier this season that his goal for the ECC Championships was to place in the middle of the pack as a team. With nine women’s teams and eight men’s teams competing at the meet, both teams were able to accomplish this goal.
“They met my expectations but kind of went beyond what everybody was expecting,” Buckley said. Many of the athletes ran multiple events with very little breaks in between, but Buckley said his teams were able to stay physically and mentally tough.
The athletes who won their event at the ECC Championship qualified for the final meet of the indoor track season, the ECAC/IC4A Championships in Boston on March 4.

The fourth ranked women’s lacrosse team started its 2017 season off strong by winning its first game of the season against 20th ranked Pace University 15-8 on Feb. 25.
The Pioneers held a 3-point lead going into the second half, but the Setters were able to score three unanswered goals to tie the game at seven points with less than 18 minutes left to play. The home team quickly responded with a burst of six unanswered goals to take a commanding lead of 13-7 with three minutes left on the clock. The Pioneers only allowed one more goal from the Setters, and ended the game seven points ahead to win their first game of the season.
“We’ve been waiting for this day for so long,” head coach Meghan McNamara said after the game. “Playing against a great team like Pace and challenging us like that just really kind of put things in perspective of how capable we are.”
Sophomore mid fielder Ryan McKinney scored a career-high six goals for the Pioneers, two of which came during the six goal burst toward the end of the second half. Senior attackers Connor Bird and Stefani Vagelatos, each tallied four points, and junior goalie Olivia Kirk was able to stop eight attempts by the Setters.
The Pioneers only had nine turnovers during the game compared to the Setters’ 12, two of which were caused by Pioneer defender Cara Douglas. The home team also outshot the Setters 33-17.
Coach McNamara said her team looked very strong and confident, and she hopes they will continue to create and control an upbeat tempo on both ends of the field. “I think our transition game was great, but we have to work on some little tweaks on the defensive and offensive side,” McNamara said.
Coach McNamara and the Pioneers return to action March 1 against Nyack College in Nyack, NY at 7 pm.
