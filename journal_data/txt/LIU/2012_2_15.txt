Since September 17th, 2011, the Occupy Movement has spread across the world, and it is no longer confined to the financial monopolies of America. The movement has spread to college and university campuses as well.
The root of the Occupy Movement, both on and off university campuses, is money; fiscal transparency is a demand, and so are accountability and consequences for the heads of the institutions. Some of the universities that have active Occupy Movements are Pittsburg University, the University of California’s Irvine Campus and Harvard University. For years, students have wondered where their money is going, and their voices were never heard. But, with the start of the social demonstrations taking place around the globe, people have more confidence in standing up and saying something.
There is a group on campus called Occupy LIU; the group is not a club and says, “We do not want to become an official club on campus. Our goal is to reform things on campus, and becoming a club that accepts money from the administration we are trying to change would be counterproductive to our cause,” says Jeremiah Wenutu, a senior Film major, here at Post.
Occupy LIU is unique in that it is not just comprised of students but also of faculty members. Many of the things that affect students affect faculty as well. The level of education students receive is based on the support and resources teachers have. When students and faculty see eye to eye, there is a greater chance of change because the two groups are usually pit against each other, or one is forced to be silent. Bridging that divide forms an alliance in the battle to initiate change.
One of the group’s goals is to have more transparency between the Board of Trustees, the faculty and the students before huge fiscal decisions are made.
LIU students and faculty were shocked by two very big decisions made by the Board of Trustees and the administration this year. The first came when full-time professors were asked to sign their new contracts, which entailed a zero-percent pay increase for five years, while having to pay an increased amount toward their health insurance plans. This is after the faculty’s last contract, which also included a five-year pay freeze. Then, the multi-million dollar rebranding initiative took place. The University claims the initiative “will help bring in more students if we change our look and advertise to a wider market.”
Professor Soupios responded by stating, “It’s window dressing; none of the real problems are fixed.”
The major complaint among students at LIU Post is in the service it provides, including to the students in the dorms, to the advisement staff and to financial aid. How is this University supposed to keep the students they bring in without fixing the problems they have?  Students have the freedom of transfer to a school that will charge less or the same for tuition, and they will get what they are looking for. Professor Carlin, an Earth Science instructor, poses a question: “With this rebranding officially done, what is the vision for this campus in the future?”
The Occupy LIU group is planning “Teach-Ins” that coincide with the National Student Solidarity Protest in preparation for the March for Education that will take place in New York and in Washington D.C. The topics they are trying to push are student debt, the steady rise of tuition prices, and the students’ unfortunate need to take out astronomical loans to pay for their educations. The Occupy LIU group is trying to push these issues to the forefront and join the national movement to lower student debt. Student debt goes up as the years go by; it never goes down. Jobs are harder to find, so paying off these loans upon graduation has become more difficult for every graduating class.
Occupy LIU is not just about the financial problems but also about other campus and administrative issues that occur at Post. They want to create working groups that can provide them with real data about the number of students experiencing certain problems that are either unique to the groups they fall into (for example: international students, LGBT, etc.) or general problems. This will be a part of “increasing accountability of the administration for their responsibilities,” Pastor John Dornheim, the Protestant Chaplain at LIU Post, explains.
Student opinion on this group varies. Jessica Singh, a senior English Adolescent Education major, says, “I think that this group is trying to address many topics that are prevalent, not only to the students and the faculty but also to the present time we are in. However, I am unsure of how successful they will be because some of the problems they are addressing are complicated to resolve.”
However, William Lindberg, a senior graduate student, says, “I think it’s a very good idea; since the students pay a lot in tuition, it should be obvious that they should know what is being done with their money. Students, teachers and other faculty members know what needs to be improved, and, therefore, they should have influence. If it’s organized in a good way, it could definitely work. As far as the fiscal transparency, that is a big necessity, and it needs to be addressed immediately.”

Students joined together to celebrate a night of culture and friendship at International Friendship Night. American and International Post students danced the night away in the Long Island Room of Winnick on Wednesday night. It was a party that welcomed new, international students and helped them to learn about Americans while simultaneously establishing friendships.
Wednesday night began with students welcoming each other.  Everyone took their seats at round tables to prompt conversation; each table was as diverse as the next. The students played a type of get-to-know-you game, where each student was given a sheet of paper with questions to ask about the other students’ cultures. The room quickly became filled with questions like: “How do you say…?” “What type of things do you do for fun?” And, “Tell me about your hometown.”  The conversations picked up with momentum, causing it to be challenging to transition the group onto the next activity.
Students were encouraged to walk around and mingle with one another.  They were also urged to talk with someone whom they had never met before. The rest of the night was spent playing games and dancing to a live DJ. Many students took the floor, teaching each other dances like the Cotton-Eyed Joe. The dancing continued the whole night, and it appeared as though everyone was having a great time, as many students were wearing big smiles on their faces.
Daphne Hsu, a first-year graduate Interactive Multimedia Art student from Taiwan, attended international friendship night and talked about how great the event made her feel. She used the words “funny” and “kind” to describe her emotions about the evening. She also mentioned how she loved all of the dancing that had consumed the night. Hsu said, “I had a lot of fun last night. I met a lot of people from different countries, and the activity made me feel like I can join American life.”
The night was spent as a great learning experience for both international and American Post students. Susan Shang, a first-year graduate student from China, majoring in Public Administration, explained how she loved the event, and if she could go again, she would. “I loved last night’s event because dancing can reduce pressure,” Shang said. “It is a good way for meeting new friends and practicing English. Last night, I felt so good; dancing was my favorite part, and it just let me forget many things and relax,” she continued.
The night came to an end around 10:00, and many students left with new friends and gained knowledge of other cultures around the world. Michelin Janvier, a Junior Speech-Language Pathology major, spoke about how much fun the night was and how it made her feel joyful. “It was nice to see the American and international students having a good time,” she said. “I think it is important to make friends with international students and to learn about their cultures and origins, as they bravely do so by being in this country.”

A week after LIU Post was officially launched, students’ email accounts will now be undergoing a change as well.
Students’ MyLIU email accounts will be switched over to Gmail, with a scheduled go-live date of Monday, February 20th.
The switch is being made to provide students with more computing power, more storage space, and Google Apps for Education, said Nancy Marksbury, Deputy CIO of Information Technology. The campus’ Information Technology office sent out an email to every student’s LIU address on Monday, February 6th, informing everyone of the change.
LIU accounts will be down from February 17th through Monday morning, so IT can migrate emails to the new server.
Students will still be able to access their emails through www.my.liu.edu, and usernames and passwords will stay the same. However, through this new site, users will be able to get to Blackboard directly and reset their account passwords online instead of going to the IT office for to do so. Students will also be able to access their emails separately from the student center. This means that when you login, a typical Gmail interface will come up with only your emails as opposed to the various financial aid, enrollment, transcript and other LIU links that show up now.
Once IT has finished moving emails, it will begin to work on adding a few other special features to students’ accounts. Students will be able to make their own Google+ accounts and access it from their student centers. Also, with the Google calendar feature, the students’ class schedules will be automatically uploaded to it, so you can plan around your classes.
Senior Environmental Science major Brian Arons said that he is excited about the change.
“I don’t use my LIU account because it’s really slow,” he said, adding the thought that the Blackboard app and the separate mail option were good added features.
However, junior Broadcasting major Victoria Saporito didn’t have the same enthusiasm.
“I already have Gmail, and it’s not the greatest server,” she said. She also felt there are too many changes on little, unnecessary things and not enough focus on bigger issues around campus.
Despite the mid-semester timing, Marksbury said IT is not anticipating any problems with the migration. The IT team has been working hard to test the system to ensure no problems arise, she added.

First and foremost, we would like to thank everyone who has supported the Pioneer this year. Jacqueline, our staff and I have worked tirelessly this year to provide LIU Post with a great paper and we have definitely accomplished that.
 
As journalists, we have a job. Our job is to inform the public. If we never reported issues or situations about our campus, we would not be doing our jobs. When we report a news story, it is never to “bash” or make any one look bad. Our stories have always and continue to be fair and balanced news.
 
It is incredible to see students, faculty and staff reading our paper. The fact that we are reaching some, if not all of you, is the most rewarding part of this experience. Even when people criticize us, there is still a sense of happiness because then we know people are reading. And we will always have our critics. If we did not report a certain story, people would say we weren’t doing our jobs and when we report something people don’t like, then we’re being insensitive.
 
No matter what, our staff, Jacqueline and I will continue to report fair and balanced stories. We are absolutely open to suggestions and to ideas. We invite all students to come to our meetings every Monday during Common Hour in Hillwood Commons.
 
We hope that everyone continues to read the Pioneer and send in your suggestions to cwpstpnr@gmail.com.

Joseph Pulitzer once said,
“There is room in this great and growing city for a journal that is dedicated to the cause of the people rather than that of the purse potentates – that will expose all fraud and sham, fight all public evils and abuses-that will sever and battle for the people with earnest sincerity.”
The sole purpose of a newspaper is to provide the public with information they would not find elsewhere. Its loyalty lies with those who remain unaware. Journalism does not aim to please, its goal is to objectively report news and bring forth information that is both accurate and truthful.
As a college newspaper, it is almost impossible to satisfy everyone. Our allegiance is to anyone who seeks to be informed. Sometimes we hit bumps in the road, but we try to use our best judgment while keeping those we serve in mind. This means no matter how controversial a story is, we must cover it. We use only facts, and obtain our information from primary sources.
The Pioneer has come a long way, and we would like it to continue to grow as a reliable source students can count on to obtain news. Our staff works diligently to report important issues objectively, while making the paper interesting and engaging. We are always open to feedback, and encourage readers to submit their ideas and concerns.

Friends,
 
I am wondering about the basis for your claim (or insinuation) that Ash Wednesday is the beginning of the Lenten season for only Roman Catholics? Nothing could be further from the truth. Christians all over the world observe this period, including many on this campus who are not Roman Catholic. Because it is impossible to schedule two worship services in the same space at the same time, I take ashes out to where students and staff may be congregating. Last year, I was in Hillwood Commons. The response was overwhelming. I have yet to decide whether to go back to Hillwood or try Winnick. Regardless, ashes are not saved for just the Roman Catholic community here or anywhere.

Dear: Pioneer Newspaper
 
On February 1, 2012, I was saddened to see the mug shot of Coach Pete Timmes on the front page of the school newspaper along with the details of his arrest. Coach Timmes made a mistake that day and so have others on this campus.
The difference is they have not been tried in the court of public opinion. It is sad to think that someone thought this story deserved to be on the front of the college newspaper. The event did not take place on the campus, nor did it involve anyone on the campus.
What troubled me the most is that I am involved in many activities on this campus and, at every event held on campus, the administration stresses Post pride and the idea of a L.I.U. Post family. Post is considered a place that no matter what happens outside of this great university there is always a place at L.I.U. Post for graduates.
Coach Pete Timmes was not just the L.I.U. Post baseball coach; he also was an alumnus that had given over 30 years to the university he loved so much. What is truly troubling, although what Coach Timmes did was unlawful, there were others in the Post family who decided it was appropriate to disgrace a man who up until this mistake has spent his whole adult life on this campus first as a student and then as a faculty member.
How can a man that had given so much back to his university ever call this institution home again like so many administrators have stressed throughout my time at Post. It is a shame to think that even his so called home has persecuted and exiled him from his extended family. While earlier in the year, there was an incident with a professor that brought a loaded gun to school. In attempting to render the weapon safe, he accidently discharged a round endangering not only his life but also the lives of so many other students around him. This Professor was not a Post graduate, nor was he featured on the front cover of the school newspaper. While both incidents were criminal acts, one man whose incident was on campus and affects so many others was able to escape the public humiliation of having his face put on the front page of the school newspaper. Coach Pete Timmes was not as fortunate. It is truly a shame that the faculty and staff in charge of the voice on this campus cannot live up to the administrations ideology of family and pride on the L.I.U. Post University. You have to give loyalty in order to receive it.
 
Sincerely,
John Hannan

We meet again Valentine’s Day. At least it’s a reliable holiday; it comes the same day every year so you have time to prepare yourself. I’ve found that there is no gray area around the feelings towards this day, you either love it or you hate it. If you have a significant other, chances are you enjoy it. If you’re single, you probably can’t stand it.
It’s supposed to be this one special day of the year that you devote to the person that you love, which sounds great in theory. But that’s not what Valentine’s Day is about. It’s about spending money, getting flowers and candy, all types of trinkets in the shape of a heart, and getting taken out to dinner.
First of all, what holiday isn’t about spending money anymore? Two, I do NOT want to go out to eat on every restaurants busiest day of the year so I can wait for over an hour to eat mediocre food. And three, buy me flowers on a random Tuesday and I will appreciate it so much more than receiving them on the one day of the year that every woman in the world is getting them too.
That’s not special and certainly doesn’t prove that you care about me.  It proves that you looked at a calendar and remembered, “Oh crap, I have to get her stuff so she doesn’t get mad at me.”  Of course I’ll never be against getting gifts from the person I care about. My point is that I’d prefer flowers on a random day, not the biggest Hallmark holiday there is.
Now, I know all of you reading this that aren’t single are thinking to yourself that this is just the ranting and raving of a bitter, single girl. Not true, I still felt this way even when I had a boyfriend. I have always thought this Valentine’s Day was superfluous and overrated. I just think it’s silly for everyone to get so worked up and strung out over a nonsense holiday.
Food for thought: If you need a set date to remember to tell your boyfriend/girlfriend that you love them then you may want to rethink your priorities.

Perhaps one of the greatest political debates is whether or not religion belongs in politics and if it does, how much religion should influence policy and decision-making. Almost everyone has some kind of opinion on the subject, but when it comes right down to it, opinion means nothing.  Those that actually make the laws and want to be re-elected, need to please both ends of the spectrum and respect both religion and politics. This is not at all easy to accomplish and causes a lot of rift among all in Congress and the President. Recently, President Obama was given the challenge of keeping everything fair for all.
Not long ago, in his health care reform law, President Obama (and Congress) made the process to acquire birth control a lot easier. The law made it so that employers giving insurance policies had to offer birth control as part of the plan. It made it possible for women to acquire birth control more easily and to pay less. President Obama went on the record at the time and said that “no woman’s health should depend on who she is or where she works.” This was re-quoted in an article on the BBC News webpage on Friday February 10, 2012.
This policy has made it more possible for women to obtain birth control and be safe. However, since the employer was basically paying for it, many religious employers have objected. Churches, religious schools, religious hospitals, or anywhere else where religion is important to the institution didn’t want to pay for something their religion disagrees with through insurance policies for their employees. This is where it gets tricky, if a woman teaching in a religious school wants birth control, under the new law the school has to provide it even though they disagree with the idea of birth control. This puts President Obama in an awkward spot; how do you keep everyone happy? You have to respect both the right to religion and the right of people who wish to choose to take birth control.
President Obama was able to figure out a way to keep both groups happy with as little harm as possible. However, insurance companies may not be as happy. What he did was alter the law so that insurance companies have to now offer the birth control service for free. This makes it so that religious groups no longer have to pay for a service they disagree with and women can still obtain birth control for free. True, the insurance companies will lose some money but the law itself does something that is very rarely done. It actually has the potential to make both ends of the spectrum happy. With the election looming over his head, this could help win over a few votes for President Obama, but if it will win him the election only time can tell.

Growing up at an early age, you may have found yourself stealing your older sister or maybe even your mother’s makeup when playing dress up. This would result in smeared lipstick, pink rosy cheeks in one spot, and blotches of un-even makeup all over your skin. However, as you get older, you may find yourself dealing with dry skin, acne, or dark spots on your face.
We as girls (sorry, boys) tend to be a little bit more careful when applying our makeup as we grow up. Whether you’re going for a natural, classy look or a dramatic smoky eye to give your eyes a little bit of pop, a lot of people don’t realize that putting makeup on is a process, and it all starts with taking care of your skin. So before you go to grab your foundation and eyeliner, check to see if you have a good face wash or healthy moisturizers for a spotless complexion.
Neutrogena and Clean and Clear are two of the best drug-store beauty brands that you definitely can’t go wrong with. If you’re looking for a good face wash that will remove your makeup, dirt, and oil, try Neutrogena: Oil Free Acne Wash. According to an article by Julyne Derrick titled, “ Best Cleansers for Every Skin Type,” this Neutrogena face wash was voted “Allure Magazine 2010 Reader Choice Awards winner.” You can also try dermatologist recommended brand, “Cetaphill.” This face wash is creamy and leaves a smooth sensation on your face. It isn’t loaded with as much chemicals and fragrances, compared to other cleansers. So, if you have sensitive skin, this cleanser would be a better alternative.
Clean and Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser, a face wash that is perfect for day and night time, removes your makeup along with the oil and dirt in your pores. Lastly, the 4 in 1 Self-Foaming Cleanser by Biore cleans, tones, stimulates, and detoxifies leaving your face with a tingly cool feeling.
Clearly, a good cleanser doesn’t have to always be expensive. So before you pick up your old face wash, try a new one in your local drug store because you may be surprised of how much you’ll love it!
The second step to healthy skin is a good moisturizer. Before buying a good face cream, check to see if there is an SPF in it because you want a product that will protect your skin from the sunlight at all times. Try Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion with SPF 15. This is a lightweight cream that will improve dull, rough, uneven skin so your face looks newer and younger. Another popular cream is Eucerin Facial Moisturizer with SPF 30.
If you are looking to spend money on a face cream that’s a little more than your budget, but for something that is worthwhile, try the brand Clarins. There are all different moisturizers for day and night time, as well as for all types of the skin. These moisturizers can be found in your local mall in the beauty department.
It is important to wash your face in the morning and especially before you go to bed. Leaving on makeup can clog your pores and cause breakouts. Try one of these face washes and moisturizers and you will be looking and feeling fabulous in no time!

Some of you may have just spent your weekend with your significant other and had a romantic evening. Or, maybe some of you may have spent your weekend with friends and went out to a great party. Well, if you’re reading this, the point I am trying to get across is there is nothing wrong with being single and it is okay to spend your time with friends and enjoy yourself, rather than being tied up to someone. I don’t know about you, but I feel many students believe that there is something wrong with be single. I mean, don’t get me wrong, but all relationships are not always about butterflies and rainbows, there is fighting and drama along with it.
Have you ever felt jealous or upset when you see a couple and you think to yourself,  “Why don’t I have a boyfriend or girlfriend?” It’s okay to feel like this, because in all honesty, it’s completely normal. College is a stepping stone towards the next stage in our lives. Most people can agree this is a time to be independent because at the end of the day, the only person you should worry about is yourself. This independence allows us to do the things we want to do now, because we may not get a second chance to do something over again.
With this said the question is, “What motivates you to be single?”  Here are a few pointers to keep you motivated.
First things first, don’t sell yourself short; meaning do not settle for someone or something when you know you deserve way better. Ironically, some people do. I myself have in the past. Surround yourself with positive people because if you don’t, you might find yourself slipping into behaviors or habits that you wouldn’t be doing in the first place. You may be involved with someone, but in all reality, this someone may not be so right for you. This person may be far below what you truly deserve in life. Don’t settle. If you know you deserve your “perfect guy”, you will find them because chances are, they are out there. Hanging out with the right crowd will allow you to find someone that is at your level.
We all think we are going to find our prince charming. You may find yourself sitting on the couch or laying in bed watching a romantic comedy, and instead of your boyfriend or girlfriend being there, you now resort to your other friends that go by the name of Ben and Jerry. If you have certain expectations and standards in your life, don’t stay with someone just because you feel you “need” someone that is giving you attention and comfort. Be with somebody because you want to be with them and because they are right for you. I feel as college students we truly don’t know who we are as people and what we really want in life. Therefore, we become involved in relationships just for the sake of being in one. Your prince charming is out there. Everything in life happens for a reason and it’s okay to dream big.
Lastly, focus on yourself, school work, jobs, and your extracurricular activities are what will prepare you for a successful and happy life. So, study if you know you have a big exam the next day, go to that party that your friends and you will be talking about for weeks, and most importantly have fun. At the end of the day, you are the only person that can make yourself happy. If you can’t be happy and love yourself, then how is any other person going to? Jamie Boswell, a freshman Musical Theater major added,  “For me, I just feel that I want to be focused on my work, especially in my major, I don’t need other distractions. I need to focus on my art. I haven’t found “that” person yet, so I consider myself an independent person, which motivates me to be single. Whatever happens…happens.”
Samantha Osgood, a junior Sociology major and Political Science minor, said, “People that are single want to focus on their school work, friends, and themselves in general, but when you are tied down to somebody, you then have to worry about that person all the time. Also, people that are single can have fun and more freedom. I’m just living my life the way I want to.”
Angelica LaLota, a senior Speech Pathology major, “At this point in my life, it’s essential to focus on school. I think this is the time when you’re supposed to be having fun in college. In today’s day and age, people are getting married at an older age and I feel a person should be on the right track before you settle down with someone. “
”I like being single because I am an independent woman,” says Audrey Thompson, junior Social Work major. “I don’t have time to deal with boys because I need to concentrate on my school work. Now is not the time for me to be in a committed relationship. In my own opinion, take advantage of your young adulthood because you won’t be single forever. Now is the time to learn about yourself and what you truly want in a person.”

Just like snowflakes, each one of us is different and unique especially when it comes to our figures. This means that not all of the latest trends look good on all of us. Therefore, it is pertinent to understand how to dress your specific body shape. Easier said than done, right? Now, unless your name is Clinton Kelly, of TLC’s “What Not to Wear”, chances are you are not entirely certain how to dress for your body shape. In fact, you might not even know what your body shape is to begin with. But have no fear; I am here to help you solve this ever-present dilemma. For starters, there are four main body types: banana, apple, hourglass, and pear. Despite the stupid monikers, these are quite helpful when figuring out what looks best on you.

“I try to focus less on the size of the clothing and more on how it looks and fits. At the end of the day, when you look better, you feel better. Personally that is why I like to wear skinny jeans. They go with every outfit and also really flatter your figure,” said senior Radiology Technology major Denise Finkel.
Banana: 46 percent of women have banana-shaped bodies. You have a straight, rectangular physique in which your hips and waist are about the same size. In order to avoid looking lanky or boyish, you should cinch in your waist to give the allusion of having curves. You want to add more texture, dimension, and femininity to your look. For example, try shirts with ruffles and frills while avoiding baggy clothing—that will only make you look boxier. Gwyneth Paltrow and Sarah Jessica Parker are banana-shaped as well so check out how they dress.

Apple: The 14 percent of women that are apple-shaped are more top heavy than the other body types. Emphasize your legs, bust, and neck while camouflaging your waist and shoulders/arms. For instance, flowing v-neck tops that drape or skim over your midsection work to highlight your best attributes. Wear more flared or boot cut jeans as opposed to skinny jeans to help with more balance. Use Tyra Banks or Angelina Jolie as your body type double.

Hourglass: This is probably the most well-known shape, thanks to the Kardashians and Sir Mix-A-Lot’s famous hit “Baby Got Back”. However, only about eight percent of women are that lucky. Suffice it to say, we are no longer friends…only kidding! An hourglass shape is exactly what it sounds like—your bust and your hips are equal and your waist is narrow, you lucky girl. Make sure you dress to flatter, and not flatten, your curves. Take some cues from Sofia Vergara or Scarlett Johansson.

Pear: If you are more bottom heavy, meaning your hips are significantly larger than your bust, you are like the 20 percent of women who are pear-shaped. Slim your hips and butt to give the appearance of being more proportionate. Choose materials like wool or denim that keep their shape to streamline your body. Wear clean tailored lines on the bottom and a pop-of-color top to draw attention upwards. Celebrities like Rihanna or Kate Hudson can help you learn how to dress more flattering.

For more information, check out pictures of the celebrities mentioned to see what works best for them. After all, they are the ones with stylists that know what they are talking about. Lastly, check out website like www.shabbyapple.com where you can answer a few questions, figure out your body shape, and shop only clothes that pertain to it. Now go out there and get some fabulous, well-fitting clothes.

As most of you know by now, most of my inspiration for these columns comes from recent experiences. I’m usually pretty good with keeping my gas tank full, this week I was driving in the snow and my car started to ding, letting me know that it needed fuel. Uh-oh, what do I do? It’s two-thirty in the morning, snowing, and I need to get gas? I was also traveling by highway, so the nearest gas station around was unknown. But as I continued on my thirty-minute drive home, I started to calm down. Just because the little light goes on, it doesn’t mean you need to get gas right then and there.
Many cars now can tell the driver exactly how many more miles until the gas runs out. Well, mine doesn’t exactly do that, so I drove a bit slower than usual and even put on the cruise control, since it’s an empty road at two-thirty in the morning. I got home okay without a trip to the gas station. I immediately looked it up and found out according to www.tankonempty.com, the driver can travel an additional 30 to 40 miles after the gas light is on. Many car companies use the gas light as a warning for drivers to get their gas soon and are hopeful drivers find it as a comfort. Because you don’t want your car to all of a sudden stop moving in the middle of the L.I.E.
There are other ways you can even preserve gas in your car if the gas meter is running low. The obvious one is slowing down your speed. This reduces 7% of your fuel if you slow down a mere 5 mph.  Another way is to drive smoothly. Slamming your brakes, swerving (which I don’t recommend), and doing different speeds on the road all uses more gas than needed. The weight of your car is another factor. The car has to work harder when there’s unnecessary weight involved. So if you’re a hoarder with too much stuff, get rid of it.  Many websites have said that turning off your car during a long stoplight helps the fuel. But in this weather, we’ll ignore that one. Warming up your car in the morning is stated to add more pollution and uses more gas than can be used for actual driving. But for snow purposes, you might still want to warm up your vehicle.
To avoid a side-road show because your car has run out of gas, listen to your car and get gas when needed. With this tough economy and high gas prices, many people are pinching gas costs in every way. So be smart and decide when getting gas is best for you. Safe driving everybody!

It has been argued by many that it is a choice to be queer. That one day someone wakes up and decides that they want to be attracted to the same sex, or that they are were born the wrong gender, or that they no longer want to have a gender. Some openly homosexual individuals have even gone on record to say that they chose to be gay, Cynthia Nixon being one of them.
But the question I ask you to consider is why would someone consciously choose to be subject to hate? Why would someone choose to be denied rights? Why would someone choose to live such a difficult life?
I didn’t choose to be gay. I was beaten up all through elementary and middle school. Why would anyone choose that? You can’t tell me that I decided one day that I wanted to be verbally and physically assaulted by my classmates. That would be crazy.
Of course things have gotten better since I was in middle school. This past summer, marriage equality bills were passed in New York State and just last week in Washington State, the day after Proposition 8 was found to be unconstitutional in California. And as much as these are great achievements, LGBTQ individuals are still struggling against discrimination. There are twenty-nine states in which homosexual individuals can be fired simply for being homosexual. Also, there are thirty-eight states in which you can be fired for being transgender.
It seems ridiculous. We imagine America as a place where we have certain inalienable rights, but not everyone has the same rights. Imagine for a moment if your boss was allowed to fire you because you were left-handed. Then how could anyone be fired for being LGBTQ?
To quote Lady Gaga in her hit “Born This Way,” “No matter gay, straight, or bi, lesbian, transgender life I’m on the right track, baby, I was born to survive.” We don’t choose to be hated or hurt, no one would. At what point does a heterosexual wake up and decide to be heterosexual? When does a turtle wake up and decide to be a turtle? We don’t. No one chooses who he or she is. No one chooses who they love.
Of course, we’re lucky to be in America where we are free to live our lives as peacefully as the government allows. In Uganda, homosexual men and women are considered criminals. A bill has been in the works called the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill; it has also been called the “Kill the Gays Bill” in the media. This bill would allow the government to arrest and possibly execute known homosexuals. A Ugandan newspaper printed names of suspected homosexuals and even included tips on noticing homosexuals in public places.
I hear people say, “We live in 2012, this shouldn’t be happening,” and you’re right. We’ve come a long way in our own country, but we have a long way to go, not only here but also all over the world. Hopefully one day soon the world will catch up with the people living in it.
Recently Ellen Degeneres was hired as the new spokesperson for JC Penney. A group that calls themselves One Million Moms protested her being hired by the popular chain department store. Their Twitter page reads:  “A network of Christian moms and grandmothers taking a stand for our children who are being exploited by the entertainment industry.” They posted on their Facebook page that JC Penney should prepare to lose a lot of business after hiring the openly gay television personality and comedian.
Discrimination and Adversity will always be a problem, but if we stand together and protect each other we can overcome it. We can change their minds, we can change the future, and we can change the world.

Just like the New York Giants, who won the Super Bowl XLVI, the big game commercials are still going strong. During the Super Bowl, each 30-second ad spot cost advertisers $3.5 million. This year, VW continued with its Star Wars theme; Honda pulled in with Matthew Broderick reprising his role as Ferris Bueller from “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” while Audi killed off “Twilight’s” Team Edward. Acura flew in with “Seinfeld,” while M&Ms stripped down with the debut of Ms. Brown.
Super Bowl XLVI was watched by 111.3 million viewers, just .3 million more than last year, making it the most watched TV program in U.S. history. The game posted a 47.8 overnight rating and a 71 share according to Nielsen overnight data. That’s the third-highest ever recorded. With these numbers, the marketers made some really good decisions in working with popular franchises that resonate well with viewers.
My absolute favorite ad has to be M&Ms debut of Ms. Brown, who is voiced by Vanessa Williams. The M&M spokescandy characters have been around for years. It has been a pleasure watching them grow. Besides Red, Yellow, Miss Green, Orange, and Blue, it was about time there was an addition to the lineup. There are so many other colors to choose from; their marketing possibilities are somewhat endless. I did learn something about M&Ms that I never knew before: they can strip. I hope Red didn’t hurt himself there. According to Williams, Ms. Brown opened the Museum of Chocolate in SoHo with a brown carpet event, introducing a 300-pound sculpture of herself. She’s also making an appearance on “Celebrity Apprentice” in February.

The most exciting show to hit HBO since “True Blood” is “The Game of Thrones.” A complex show with riveting characters, this show is not one to miss. Based on the book series, “A Song of Ice and Fire,” by George R.R. Martin, “The Game of Thrones” is the first book. There has only been one season and ten episodes, but season 2 will begin airing on April 1st.
The first season revolves around the Stark family. Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is the chief administrator to the King, who is also his best friend. The King, Robert Baratheon, is a fat, drunk, lively being. He likes to have fun, but when making decisions, he is not useful. His cunning wife, Queen Cersei, is the decision maker. A deceitful woman, she is also having an affair with her own brother, who fathered all three of her children. The King is aware of this but keeps it under wraps from the community. The eldest of the children is Prince Joffrey, a terrible human being whose goal is to be king one day and chooses Eddard Stark’s daughter, Ansa, for his queen. The rest of the Stark children are the bastard-born John Snow, Robb, Arya, Bran, and Rickon.
Another important family in the series is Daenerys and Viserys Targayren. They are the last of the Targayren tribe. Viserys marries his sister, Daenerys, to the tribe lord, Khal Drogo, of the nomadic tribe, in order to produce more Targayren babies. Viseyrs plans to overthrow King Robert in order to gain back the throne that belonged to his father.
Although the show introduces and kills off characters often, making it complex, it’s easier to follow than you’d think. Reading the books first would help, but watching it is even better. I highly recommend the show to those who love fantasy and fiction. The show is vulgar and violent at times, so it should be cautioned for those who aren’t ready for that. And, it also has a massive amount of nudity and sex. It’s an underrated show in my opinion but definitely one to catch up on. Trust me, this is not one to miss! I’ll be counting down the days to April 1st.

Bungee jumping, obstacle courses and mechanical bulls…oh, my! These are some fun activities that are found at LIU Post for thrill seekers. The adventurous activities have appeared at numerous campus events, including the Back to School BBQ, Pratt After Dark, and the Spring Fling Carnival.
These amusing activities are catching to the eye and may look easy. However, looks can be deceiving. Some are harder than one might think. During my time at Post, I have tried all three. I participated in two of these fun-filled activities two weeks ago at Pratt After Dark. The mechanical bull did not make an appearance.
I have bungee jumped only once before, in my freshman year, and I felt like it was telling me to go on again. I strapped on the Velcro support straps to my thighs. I jumped up and down, bouncing in the air. For a few minutes, it was very exciting. I enjoyed the rush of being above ground and the feeling of the wind in my hair. I did a spilt in the air and a tuck jump, going back to my gymnastic days. I started to get tired soon after. Plus, the Velcro straps were digging into my legs and starting to hurt.
However, I remember seeing others before me do flips quite effortlessly. I wanted to at least try. So, I continued to jump, but I did not get high at all. I screamed to the guy in charge, “How do you flip upside down?” He said you have to build up enough speed and get high enough to flip. I think one has to be in good physical shape to do this. I tried a few times but became short of breath and never accomplished this task. My thighs were sore for a few days, so I don’t think I will be doing this again at the Spring Fling Carnival.
After some Powerade and Italian ice, I was ready for the obstacle course. I have done this a few times before, and I think it is fun to compete with different people. Two people race each other in this course; whoever is the fastest wins. It starts with a climb upwards, which is similar to a rock wall; this was my least favorite part. The steps you must climb are small and slippery, but there are ropes on the sides that got me to the top. Next, is the slide, which I went down on my stomach to save time. I landed on the inflatable air, which is what the course is made out of, so I was safe.
The next part of the course requires you to crawl past inflatable poles. Don’t go too close to them, or they will hit you. It’s been quite some time since I crawled on my knees, but I thought this part was pretty easy. Another tall rock wall came next. Only because of the ropes on the side was I able to get up it so quickly. Otherwise, I would have taken a long time. Note to self: never try rock climbing. The course ended with one last slide. I slid down my stomach once again, much slower this time, since the land here was a hard wood floor. I stopped at the end of the slide, avoiding the fall.
Be careful. I saw many students land hard on the fall, most of them head first. My opponent and I were very close. He beat me by a few seconds but crashed into the floor face first.  He had cuts and bruises on his arms and was sore. I came out unharmed. I chose my safety over competition. I think I made the right choice. This is meant only to be fun and games.
So, next time you are at a LIU Post event and are feeling daring, try some of these thrilling activities.

Sitting quite comfortably along the South Atlantic coast, Rio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil. It is a common mistake to think of Rio as Brazil‘s capital; however, that title goes to Brasilia. Nevertheless, Rio has successfully established its own reputation. For instance, whenever one thinks of this iridescent city, mental images explode of its stunning physical setting, with mountains tumbling down to sandy beaches, and its verdant rainforests, fronting the deep blue sea, just to name a few. Rio occupies one of the most spectacular settings of any metropolis in the world. On the commercial spectrum, Rio is building museums, reviving old neighborhoods and opening cafes with the World Cup coming in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016. There is no doubt that this “cidade maravilhosa” (marvelous city), is anything short of exhilarating.
Airlines/Travel: Traveling to Rio is highly accessible from the United States. There are endless airlines that fly nonstop, such as Delta, American and Continental Airlines. Brazil’s national carrier is called TAM Airlines, but in Portuguese it is TAM Linhas Aeras. The airline’s main hub is in Sao Paulo, another fabulous city in Brazil.
Hotels/Lodging: Tourism is a major component of Rio’s commercial economy. Therefore, it is imperative to book well in advance, as there is a relative shortage of hotel rooms on the cheaper range during New Year’s, Carnaval, Easter, etc. Hotel accommodations in Rio are Brazil’s most expensive. You will find Rio’s fanciest and most popular hotels along the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana, but there are lots of small, cheap, clean hotels around Flamengo and Catete. The apart-hotels in Ipanema are a much more pleasant alternative, being both better appointed and in a nicer neighborhood with fewer tourists. Famous hotels include Copacaban Hotel, Sheraton Rio Hotel and the Hotel Marina Palace.
Sightseeing/Attractions: Rio de Janeiro is a huge city with endless activities and nightlife. Activities include nature treks, sports on sun-kissed beaches, cycling and hiking paths, and water sports in the gorgeous ocean. The coastal city of Rio offers many activities that are centered on the beach and in the sea, such as scuba diving, surfing, body boarding and kite surfing. The Copacabana neighborhood, which was just a small fishing village until the 1900s, flourished rapidly after the inauguration of the Copacabana Palace Hotel. In fact, the area is divided into two beaches: Leme Beach and the actual Copacabana Beach. The area is constantly brimming with tourists, as they hang around the attractive beach, kiosks, bars and restaurants. Still, the greatest reason for visiting Rio seems to be the Carnaval. This highly-advertised party lasts for almost two weeks, and it is well known for the escolas de samba (samba schools) that parade in Centro on a gigantic structure called Sambódromo (Sambadrome).  For the shopaholics, Rio is literally a dream destination. There are many shopping stores which sell all kinds of products ranging from the latest fashion accessories that are trendy but may be a little expensive compared to weekend markets, where you can buy cheap merchandise at a throw away price. Those who are visitors should definitely invest in Brazilian handicrafts, jewelry, leather and suede products as well as souvenirs.
Cuisine/Dining: Rio offers a paradise for fine dining. Almost every international cuisine is available, but the local dishes have reached culinary heights as well. Being close to the sea of course means an unsurpassed selection of fine sea food, including fresh lobster, shrimp, shellfish, and numerous fishes. For those who like spice, Rio also has plenty of dishes native to Bahia, Brazil’s capital of hot and spicy cooking. The diva of Rio’s dishes, though, is feijoada, a black beans and pork dish that comes with rice, kale, and manioc. Wherever you go in Rio, you will find an eatery that will certainly satisfy your taste buds!

The LIU Post Pioneers women’s basketball team split the week, defeating Mercy College 81-59 on Wednesday, February 8th, and then being defeated in overtime by Saint Thomas Aquinas on Saturday, February 11th, by a score of 72-65.
The Pioneers move to 17-8 on the season and 8-5 in conference play.
In the win on Wednesday, the Pioneers shot 42.5 percent (31-73) from the field and 30.4 percent (7-23) from three-point range. Senior guard Felicia Joyner led the team in scoring with 18 points and added two assists in her 33 minutes of playing time. Freshman guard Chelsea Williams contributed 15 points of her own as well as one steal, and Samantha Kopp had 13 points and three blocks.
Mercy College jumped out to an early two-point lead in the opening minutes of the game. The Pioneers stayed with them, keeping within two points, until they tied the game at eight less than five minutes in. Sophomore guard Alexis Peters hit a lay up inside the paint and gave the Pioneers the lead, 10-8, and they did not look back. They would go on a 7-0 run to make the score 15-8. And, at one point, they led by as much as 10 points. The Pioneers finished the half up 39-33.
In the second half, Mercy College made an early attempt to gain ground on the Pioneers. At one point, Mercy managed to pull within three after senior forward Talia Beaulieu hit a jump shot to make it 45-42, but it was the closest the Mavericks would come to tying the game. The Pioneers would then go on a 9-0 run to go ahead by 12. The Pioneers’ largest lead of the half was 24, and they eventually won the game 81-59.
On Saturday, the Pioneers faced a tougher opponent in Saint Thomas Aquinas. The Pioneers managed to jump to an early 9-4 lead after a three-pointer from graduate forward Catherine Lutz. However, going into the half, the Spartans had a narrow advantage, leading 36-35.
The two teams traded leads in the second half, with the Spartans eventually grabbing a six-point lead with 1:12 left in the game.  But, the Pioneers stayed with them, as Joyner hit a three-pointer with 42 seconds left to cut the lead to two. On the following possession, Spartans’ junior guard Bianca Kowgios missed a jump shot, which would have put the game out of reach for the Pioneers. Instead, Joyner once again came up clutch, hitting a three-pointer to tie the game with three seconds left.
But, overtime would not go the Pioneers’ way. The Spartans jumped out to an early four-point lead off buckets from senior forward Briana Sloper. The Pioneers would come within two points but could not capture the lead or tie the game. Eventually, the Pioneers fell to the Spartans 72-65.
The Pioneers’ next game is at home against Queens College on Wednesday, February 15th, at 5 p.m.

The LIU Post men’s basketball team went on the road and defeated the Saint Thomas Aquinas Spartans (8-14) on Saturday, February 11th, by a score of 73-63. The Pioneers had a balanced scoring effort in which four players reached double figures in scoring. Senior guard Stefan Bonneau had a game-high 24 points and helped the Pioneers (17-5) to their 10th win in 11 games.
Boasting the East Coast Conference’s highest scoring offense, averaging 85 points per game, the Pioneers jumped out to a quick 13-2 lead in the first six minutes of action. Even with hitting one of seven attempted three-pointers and not getting to the free-throw line once, the Spartans went into the half down 34-25.
With just under 14 minutes remaining in the second half, the Spartans got their closest to the Pioneers after junior guard Irin Stark drained a three-pointer to make it 48-41 in favor of the Pioneers. But, seven points were as close as the Spartans came to the Pioneers in the second half.
In addition to Bonneau’s 24 points, the Pioneers’ big men all had solid games. Freshman forward Tyuan Williams scored 10 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, and sophomore forward Vaughn Allen had 13 points while securing nine rebounds. Providing a spark from the bench, freshman forward Charles McCann notched eight points along with eight rebounds, playing tough defense all game long.
Despite losing by 10 points, the Spartans held a slight edge in every shooting category. The Spartans were more efficient from the floor, beyond the arc, and at the charity stripe. But, stats can sometimes be misleading: the Spartans may have been more efficient from the free-throw line, but they attempted their first free-throw with just under five minutes left to play in the game. One statistic the Spartans clearly did not win was turnovers. The Pioneers had six turnovers all game long and forced the Spartans into 16 turnovers. The Pioneers took care of the ball on offense and caused problems for the Spartans on defense, which, in turn, led to another win for the red-hot Pioneers.
For the Spartans, junior guards Irin Stark and Justin Brown, along with sophomore forward Omar Kellman, led the team in scoring, each putting up 14 points. The Spartans, known more for their defense, could not do enough to slow down the Pioneers.
The Pioneers’ next game is at home on Wednesday, February 15th, against the Queens College Knights (4-18) at 7 p.m. The Knights have struggled all year long, dropping seven games in row and 15 of their last 16. The Pioneers will look for the sweep of the Knights this season, as this is their final meeting of the year, with the Pioneers winning the previous two matchups.
