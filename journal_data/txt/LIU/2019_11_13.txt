Women’s rugby’s sophomore forward, Sydney Long plays an important role as one of the team’s top players. The team won their last game of the fall season, over Molloy College with 27-12, and Long led the team in tackles and scored a try. Long also scored tries in three other games throughout the season.
The rugby team finished their fall season with an overall record of 2-6. Long says it was a “growing season” for the team as it was the first time in program history they were able to play 15 vs. 15 competitions. She also mentioned the younger members of the team, as there are only six upperclassmen out of 18 players. Long said it took some time for the team to work through different concepts and to come together. 
However, Long is very proud of how the team united towards the end of the fall season. “At the end, we finally pulled it together and we worked really hard and we did really well our last three competitions,” she said. 
The LIU rugby team is not a member of the NCAA, rather they are a part of the NIRA, the National Intercollegiate Rugby Association. Because of this, when the university announced the merger be-tween NCAA Division I and Division II, it did not directly affect the rugby team. However, Long says their team has felt positive impacts of the university’s move to Division I. “We get the prospects of the upgraded athletic training room, obviously the money for scholarships, and the money for new gear,” she said. “So that was a really big help this year.”
Long, a Tennessee native, came to Long Island to work towards pursuing a career in the FBI. “I want to be in the FBI, and I thought that the biggest police hub, in my mind, was in New York. So, I knew I wanted to come up north and be as close to a big hub as possible,” she said. Long said that rugby brought her to LIU, but the FBI was the long-term goal she had in mind. 
Long started playing rugby late in life. Having played her first year of rugby as a junior in high school, she said it wasn’t until October of her senior year that she actually began to think about pursuing a collegiate rugby career. However, even with coming in very late in the recruiting process, Long said she “made it work.” 
Looking towards the spring rugby season, the game format will switch to 7 vs. 7, leaving eight of the fall’s previous starters on the bench. “Not everyone’s gonna get to start now. So, I think a big thing for us is just continuing being a family and not let that divide come between us,” Long said. 
Academically, Long is currently undergoing the process of obtaining a summer internship with the FBI at either a location close to her home in Tennessee or at their home base in Quantico, V.A.
Looking toward the future, Sydney Long has big goals. In the short-term future, those goals include a successful spring season with the rugby team and a call back from the FBI.

The equestrian team finished as the high-point team for the fifth time during the fall 2019 season when they hosted a show on Sunday, Nov. 10, at the North Shore Equestrian Center.     
The day started with the flat class where 14 riders earned first place in the open, intermediate, limit and pre-novice divisions. During the afternoon, the riders competed in the over fences phase where nine riders placed first in the open, intermediate and limit divisions. “I’m extremely proud of how my girls worked together. It was our best home show to date,” Head Coach Brooke Chasin said about her team’s performance.  
Among the riders who won their classes was senior digital arts and design major Alex Daskam, who placed first in both her open flat section and in the open over fences class. 
“I’m very happy with my performance. I couldn’t have asked for a better way to end my last home show here at LIU,” she said. 
Daskam said a contributing factor to her success during Sunday’s show was that she got to ride on the same horse for both her classes. The riders who compete don’t know which horses they will compete with until the day of the show, where a “horse draw” is conducted. At the draw, every rider randomly draws a horse for each of their classes. “I was lucky enough to pull Ivan for both my flat class and jumping class. It’s rare to pull the same horse for both, but it’s definitely an advantage when it does happen,” she said.
Senior nutrition major Hedda Walltott also had a successful day, earning first place in her first competition in the open flat class, but un-like Daskam, she wasn’t as lucky in the horse draw. For her over fences class in the afternoon, she drew a horse she wasn’t used to and didn’t manage to reach the podium. “I prefer the hotter horses, where I’d rather have to hold back, than the horse that I got where you have to really push and move forward,” she said. “I find that difficult, but I’m still happy with how I did, it’s just that the result didn’t come out the way I wanted.” 
This Sunday was the team’s only home show during the year. being able to ride their own horses is a huge benefit of being at home. When they compete at other schools, they compete with the host’s horses. “The advantage is that we know all of the horses, so as a team, we are able to know pretty much exactly how each horse will go in the flat or over fences,” junior biology major Mackenzie Ashe said. Ashe earned second place in the over fences class. “I was so excited to be able to pull one of my favorite horses, Babouche, to jump yesterday. He is one of the most fun horses to jump, so I had no fear walking into the ring,” she said. 
Hosting a show can be stressful when you need to think of your own performance and the logistics of the event at the same time. “At other shows, all we have to worry about is our team. We don’t have to worry about taking care of horses, figuring out appropriate equipment for each horse, and making sure each horse is ready for every class that they are in,” Daskam said. 
However, all three riders said they are happy with how the team managed to get everything to work together during the event. “There was so much team spirit and togetherness,” Ashe said. 
“The show ran so smoothly and I couldn’t be happier with how the team helped each other to make the show run as successful as it did.”The team finished as the high point team in every show this season and during Sunday’s show, ending with a perfect point card. “We have a very good team spirit this year. We are a great group of girls,” Walltott said. “We are all very talented and everyone’s efforts contributes to our results.”The three riders said their coaches play a big role in their positive development as athletes and as a team. “We couldn’t ask for better coaches to make our team strong and continuously succeed,” Ashe said. 
The Sharks have one show left in their fall season, set for Sunday, Nov. 17 at the Olde Towne Equestrian Center in Selden, N.Y., before they take a break from competitions. 
The team begins their spring season on Sunday, Feb. 9 at the Jamaica Bay Equestrian Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. The team’s goal for the spring is to keep their winning streak and qualify for regional and national competitions.

The Newman Club is holding a Thanksgiving food drive on campus from Nov. 1-24. Students can bring nonperishable food items to bins around campus that the club will donate to a local food pantry in St. Patrick’s Church and to Project HOPE, a nonprofit international healthcare organization. 
Newman club allows students to be involved in their faith as well as connect with other students who share the same beliefs. The group believes in three main ideas, “ faith, fun and service,” according to Michaela Fox, senior musical theatre major and president of the Newman Club. 
The group does a lot of fellowship and religious activities. They also do service for their community including donations to the Don Monti Memorial Service and St. Jude’s Children’s hospital. However, they also like to have fun and have club events like movie nights and volleyball games with other Newman clubs around the area.
Newman Club has been around for awhile but is gaining more recognition on campus. With the large incoming freshman class, Newman Club gained several new members for the 2019-20 academic year. “Freshman have come in who are enthusiastic and excited to build something,” Govinda Bullard, campus minister, said. “We are in the beginning stages, there is a lot of potential for growth and a lot of potential for ownership.” Through word of mouth and invitations from friends, Newman Club continues to grow into a community of people striving to make a difference on campus and connect with their faith.
This year Newman Club will have a presence at Casino Night on Nov. 14 in the Tilles Center and will also be hosting a Christmas Formal alongside BASIC on Friday, Dec. 6 in the Inter-faith Center. Tickets for the formal are $7 in advance and $10 at the door. All proceeds will go to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital.

On average, about 22 veterans commit suicide a day, according to a study conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs. This staggering statistic has inspired the 22 Pushup Challenge. 
Originally created by 22KILL, a group dedicated to raising awareness to the high suicide rate among veterans, this challenge has people do 22 pushups in a row to raise awareness for veterans’ mental wellbeing. The Center of Healthy Living decided to bring this challenge to campus in 2016, and it has been an annual event ever since. 
On Wednesday, Nov. 6, students and faculty participated in the challenge in Hillwood Com-mons during common hour. Throughout the course of the event, several students stopped by and attempted the challenge. Some people were able to complete the challenge by doing all 22 pushups, while others were able to do about half the required pushups.
Students seemed to enjoy the event, but ex-pressed surprise over the statistic it was based on. “I think it’s a nice way to show respect,” Zach Tabor, a sophomore musical theatre major, said. “I think it’s a jarring statistic that 22 veterans commit suicide a day and I didn’t know about it until today. This is bringing proper light to it and I think it’s a serious problem that needs more attention.”
In addition to raising awareness, the event also helped raise money for the Wounded Warrior Project, a non-profit organization geared toward helping wounded veterans who were harmed in the military actions following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

The waves are getting bigger at the campus radio station, the Wave. With more students joining the team, a growing number of live radio shows are being aired. This semester, there are three new shows to the lineup. 
Dan Casazza, junior education major and program director of the Wave, oversees the music library and helps interested students start their own shows to air live on the Wave’s online radio station. Casazza helps students who are new to the station through the process of creating a show, and he gives them tips on how to make it better. He also assists junior broadcasting major, Samantha Uebel, who is the operations director with event planning. 
Casazza believes it’s important to have new voices on the station, but believes in quality over quantity when considering new programming. “I’d rather have four great shows then 40 shows that don’t have any substance,” he said. New shows recently added to the Wave are “Flexology,”  “Beyond Your Element,” and “Sub Rosa.” 
“Flexology” was started by junior broadcasting majors Jason Glickman, James Waldhof and Connor Lambert. The show had its first broadcast on Tuesday, Oct. 22 and covers discussions on fantasy football. “We decided to start it this semester because we’re all in a fantasy football league together and it would be cool to have our conversations and arguments broadcast for others to hear and agree or disagree with,” Glickman said. “Flexology” airs on the Wave every Tuesday from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.
“Beyond Your Element,” a show talking about the latest on campus and tips for college students, was created by Ashley Damis, senior broadcasting major and is co-hosted with junior broadcasting major Jada Harrison. The two began the radio show in early October and air every Thursday from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Harrison enjoys having an opportunity for creativity on a radio show. “I like the fact that we have autonomy and can really express ourselves at the station,” she said.
A recently developed show which explores the creepy and the unknown is coming to the Wave on Friday, Nov. 15. Alexandra Ferragamo, senior broadcasting major, and Jada Butler, senior journalism major, created a new show called “Sub Rosa.” The name is a play on an old practice of laying a rose on the mantel when there was a secret to be shared. Their show airs every Friday from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. “There is a huge stigma about people who talk about and believe in conspiracy theories. I want to open up people’s minds on the topic,” Ferragamo said.
The Wave continues to add new shows to their program to improve the quality of the station and give the station new voices. Students interested in starting their own show can con-tact Casazza at Daniel.Casazza@my.liu.edu.

The art of cosplay has been growing in popularity in recent years, and has been forming a community that has united pop culture fans all over the world. A small piece of that community has made its way to campus with the formation of the Cosplay Club.
Cosplay is when fans wear costumes to portray their favorite characters from works of fiction. The hobby has become popular within recent years, and has been the cornerstone of many pop culture events.
The idea for the club came when Theresa Roselle, a sophomore game design major and current club president, noticed how beautiful the campus was and wished she could use the grounds to do a photoshoot. At the time she already knew several students who were interested in cosplay, but didn’t want to dress up on campus. This gave her the idea to create a space where students could feel comfortable cosplaying and meet with others who enjoy the activity as well.
Weekly club meetings consist of workshopping sessions, where students are able to work on their costumes with the help of their peers. Members have a place to relax and share their passion for the hobby. “It’s therapeutic in a way, it’s like for a second you get to become your favorite character,” said Lyle Bauer, a freshman communications major. 
The Cosplay Club isn’t content with being a normal club, they want to create a community around cosplay. Beyond just appealing to students with an interest in the hobby, they also want to connect with students of all kinds by collaborating with other clubs during events. “Our goal is to have everybody on this campus connected to cosplay in some type of way,” Roselle said.
In addition to helping clubs with events, they also plan on hosting a few of their own as well. The first event planned is a slumber party on campus. The event is currently being planned for sometime between the end of classes and finals, to allow students to destress and unwind from the demands of coursework.
Charity work is also an interest that the Cosplay Club would like to pursue. The Cosplay Toy Drive is currently an event members are planning for the holiday season, where they would distribute toys to children in need while dressed as Santa’s elves. The club hopes to create a positive impact, both on and off campus, through cosplay. 
“We would like to be able to bring a light into the darkness of the world,” Jessica Pulizzotto, a sophmore digital arts major and vice president of the club, said. One example of this would be a member dressing up as Spider-Man and giving a Christmas gift to a kid to show that there is good in the world, and a way to build a community where people help each other out.
Meetings are held every Thursday during common hour in Hillwood Commons room 221. Roselle encourages students to come to Cosplay Club if they want to have fun and “create something that you can be proud of and that you want other people to be proud of.”

Emma Kocar is a junior film major known for her love of theatre. What students may not know about her is that she is also a young entrepreneur. 
Kocar is the founder of Ranny’s Crystal Cave, a small business that creates crystal based jewelry. The name came from her childhood nickname of “Ranny,” which was given to her by one of her best friends.
Kocar began collecting crystals a few years ago, an interest which lead to her collecting crystal jewelry. After watching friends wire wrap, a process where a person wraps a wire around an object to create a piece of jewelry, she became interested in practicing the craft herself. 
Armed with only crystals, wire and YouTube tutorials, Kocar taught herself how to make her own jewelry. After learning the basics, she took what she learned and twisted it into her own style, creating things that she found appealing.
She began the business itself after getting inspiration from a friend who runs an online crystal shop. Kocar currently runs every aspect of the business herself, while simultaneously remaining a full time student. When asked how she is able to handle the workload the comes with both responsibilities, she said that it’s “just a matter of time management.” 
One thing Kocar has learned from running her own business is how to promote herself. At first she wanted to avoid posting about her business too often in fear of annoying her friends, but soon found that her fears were unfounded. 
“The thing is, I would hope that my friends would be my first system of support, and so far that’s been true,” she said. “There was really no need to worry about that because they all want to support me and it’s great to see them really getting excited about it.”The most exciting part of running her business came when she made her first sale to a stranger. “[It] was really exciting for me because it reminded me that my work is out there for the public, and it’s not just limited to my friends who have been interested in purchasing it so far,” she said.
Kocar’s advice for students looking to start their own businesses is to “just go for it” and remember that success never comes overnight. “There is no such thing as overnight success because a lot of people don’t see all the sweat that goes into putting up something that turns into a super successful business,” she said.
Ranny’s Crystal Cave can be found on Etsy, Facebook and Instagram. Emma also accepts in-person purchases on campus, as well as custom orders.

Recalling a distant memory can be a challenging task because of unclear details and vague images of the past. Stephanie Hart, second-year MFA student, depicted these fuzzy memories on canvas in her exhibition “Nostalgia” from Nov. 4-8 in the Sculpture building, along with portraits of her family members. 
The meaning of Hart’s collection of paintings lies within her connections to her loved ones and the memories she shared with them. Her exhibition featured two en pleinair pieces that she painted on-site in her family’s homeland of Greece. Each piece took up to four or five hours to complete. “It was different for me, it was [my] first time painting on-site in the sun of the summer with bugs around,” Hart said. “It was definitely an experience.”
Some of Hart’s acrylic seascape paintings are abstract to symbolize the feeling she had looking back on memories of being at the beach with her family. “The abstract [style] is something new to me where I’ve been exploring and enjoying myself with it,” Hart said. “I did not work from an image, I painted from memory and let my feelings drive the image and the composition.” 
Hart’s mother, Vivian, attended the reception, and she witnessed her daughter create the paintings featured in the exhibition. “[Stephanie] always had an idea in her head of how she wanted things to turn out, even as a toddler,” she said. “You’d have to guess what it is that was on the paper that wasn’t in her mind, but, it always comes out great in the end.”Hart’s memories took on a more defined shape as her maternal grandparents were the subjects of portraits painted in realism, Hart’s primary style. For these pieces, she referenced photographs. 
Hart’s grandparents, whom she calls “Pappou” and “Yaiyai,” are still living. Her great-grandfather passed away before she ever got to meet him.
The portrait of her great grandfather is a monochromatic underpainting, meaning the lines of the image were never overlaid with a finishing layer of colored paint. “I’ve never actually met him, so working from this photograph and it being so ghostly, light and transparent, I loved that effect because of the story it was telling,” Hart said. This story is Hart’s connection to someone whose memory is only alive in her because of a photograph.
Hart completed the portrait of her grandmother in two days. The portrait was originally meant to be another underpainting that she would paint over in color, however once she completed the first step, Hart fell in love with the look of the piece. “I thought monochromatic was the way it needed to be,” she said. To duplicate the piece on another canvas, she had a print made of the underpainting’s image which she colored with oil paint, creating another original piece.
Having graduated in 2016 with a BFA in art education, Hart learned about multiple techniques and had her pick of which ones she wanted to explore. “I have always loved working with different mediums depending on what I want to achieve or [feel] like making,” Hart said. In the past she has worked with charcoal, oil pastel, ceramics and photography. Hart’s interest in working with oil paints began in spring 2019. Previously, she would primarily use acrylic paint. “I started using oil and I really fell in love with it,” Hart said. Using oil paints allowed for easier blending than with acrylic, and Hart enjoyed seeing the rich colors in her representational pieces.
Through her professors and advisors’ teaching, Hart has reached a new level of mastery in her artwork. “The art department here is really great; they are always willing to help you. If you want to put in the time, they’ll put in the time for you,” Hart said. One of her professors is Chris Anne Ambery, art professor specializing in printmaking.
Ambery advised Hart on how to approach different themes and painting techniques in her pieces. “My role is to guide her and help her along in the process,” Ambery said. “I’ve seen her flourish tremendously in this process and become more confident in her painting.”

The Student Government Association is creating a community pledge for members of the Post campus. The community pledge will encourage students to act in accordance to certain values that will make the campus community a better place. 
Members of SGA want all students to have a hand in creating the pledge, so they created an online survey to get student opinions about what should be included. The survey consists of three short questions to gauge student opinions about campus and what they want included in the pledge. 
The pledge was announced by SGA President Ashley Rodriguez during their networking event on Wednesday, Nov. 6. According to Rodriguez, the idea for a campus pledge originally came from previous SGA executive board members who wanted to find a way to get the campus community to come together.
The pledge will be based on community pledges already in place at other universities, according to John Vitucci, SGA Vice President. Stony Brook University and the University of Chicago are two universities that were named as particular sources of inspiration.
SGA plans to collect student opinions for the remainder of the semester and introduce the pledge next semester. Students can submit their suggestions for the pledge by using the link on SGA’s instagram bio @liupostsga.

MSNBC and the Washington Post will host the next Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday, Nov. 20 at 9 p.m., at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Thus far, ten candidates qualified to battle it out and further establish themselves as the right man or woman to take on President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. 
A certain criteria was met by Democratic hopefuls in order to qualify for the debate. Each candidate needs 165,000 unique donors, and a minimum of 600 unique donors per state in at least 20 states. To meet the polling threshold, candidates must meet one of two options: they can poll at three percent or higher in at least four different sponsored national or early state polls Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina or they can poll at five percent or higher in at least two single state polls from two of the four early voting states.
The ten candidates heading to their podium on debate night are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang.
Two candidates that participated in the fourth debate last month won’t be returning for the match-up in Atlanta. Former congressman Beto O’Rourke unexpectedly dropped out of the race early, and former HUD secretary Julián Castro fell short in the polling threshold.
A crowded debate stage creates little opportunity for candidates to present their ideas in depth, according to Jeremy Buchman, associate professor of political science and pre-law advisor.  With the Iowa caucus just under four months away, a strict and impartial set of qualifications are needed to diminish the talking-over one another and the disregard for time limits.
“If anything, the Democratic National Committee has bent over backwards to be fair to the detriment of the caliber of the debates. The DNC doesn’t want to be criticized for allegedly placing a thumb on the scale for any candidate, as Bernie Sanders’ campaign had alleged had happened in 2016,” Buchman said.  
This is the fifth of 12 primary debates set to take place before the first primary vote in March 2020. As donors and pollers weed through the herd of candidates, the apparent divide between liberals and moderates grow. 
Left-leaning hopefuls like Sanders and Warren continue to go head-to-head with the more centered candidates such as Biden, Booker and Klobuchar over key issues like health care and student debt. 
A socialist ideology remains a turn off to older and more moderate to conservative voters, according to Buchman. Some worry that a separation of the Democratic party is a loaded talking point for Republicans who repeatedly play the socialist label card by attaching it to politicians and policies for the last 90 years. 
“Socialism is a toxic label in American politics,” said Michael Soupios, professor of political science. He believes much of this strategy feeds off of a serious misconception. “The average American makes little or no distinctions between socialism and communism with the result that when they hear the term ‘“socialism”’ they think of the Soviet Union with all of its heavy-handed abuses,” he said.
Many belonging to the younger generations who carry the burden of student debt, climate change and gun violence are in search of reform, and policies generated by left-wing candidates appeal to this dire need of change.
But, senior broadcasting major Griffin Ward, who works behind the scenes at a major news organization and collects content from essential Sunday morning talk shows, has become familiar with the ideology of each candidate. He understands that the country is deeply polarized right now and there’s a silent majority out there primarily made up of Trump supporters who are opposed to these sorts of changes.  
 “I think it’s too drastic of an action to make. It’s riding the ship too hard the other way. I think there’s gonna be needed time and some mini changes in order to ease into it, but right now, I think with Trump’s political presence and his words which are basically gospel in a lot of the country, I think it’s too polar opposite of what socialism is and people don’t like change,” Ward said.
None of the Democratic candidates are actually putting forth a socialist policy agenda per se, according to Buchman. 
“Bernie Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist, but his platform and Elizabeth Warren’s, for that matter could be more accurately characterized as a New Deal on steroids,” he said. 
As Soupios stated, progressive ideas can be misconstrued, and many fail to notice that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are all socialist programs to which American taxpayers contribute. 
On the contrary, Soupios also called attention to the perils of “Big Brother” or the “State” and credited conservatives for warning Americans of the consequences which may derive from an Orwellian like state or “big government.” 
“America needs to be concerned with another ‘“big brother”’ an ugly, plutocratic relation with his hands all over the Corporate mechanisms of America,” Soupios said. “In fact, the ‘“Corporate Big Brother”’ may even be more of a threat than the State in the sense that big business has increasingly demonstrated a capacity to buy up the government itself.” 
Many of these points will be thrown around the debate stage from the likes of Sanders, Warren and Steyer who preach about the dangers of corporate greed and wealth. Yang will likely defend his plan to give every American $1,000 dollars per month to prevent an economic downturn as robots replace humans in the workforce. 
And if the remaining candidates, with the possible exception of Buttigieg and Gabbard, stick with their previous debate rhetoric, then Biden will likely be on the other end of their firing squad, rather than at the elephant that remains in the room and is waiting to be noticed President Trump. 
“Given this situation, what we need is less ideological blathering right vs left and more appreciation of the fact that the corruptions of power constitute an existential threat to everything we hold dear in our political system,” Soupios said.

Excellent article Ms. Miller. What Teddy Roosevelt warned us of over 100 years ago has come to pass. Government caters to big companies and their special interests and we stand by. In Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle, he tells the story of labor slavery. Nothing but the characters have changed over a hundred years later. As the professor says in your article progressive programs like social security work. We need to stop being led like sheep to the slaughter and be educated.
You did it!! You wrote a wonderful article about the Democratic party without, and I repeat, without tearing apart the Republican party. You actually reported the new in an unbiased fashion, the way it used to be a should be. Good work Shannon, well done!

Many students living in the residence halls were unable to connect to their Wi-Fi routers with dependable regularity, making it difficult for some to complete school work and maintain general communication. Some residents experienced having Wi-Fi complications since the beginning of the semester, while others were facing the issue for a short period of time. They speculate the issue is a result of the many power outages the university faced over the past couple of weeks. 
Laura Bender, a freshman dance major, blames the stormy weather. “The electricity has been flickering in and out in the dorms. Since the Wi-Fi router is plugged into the wall, I wouldn’t be surprised if this somehow reset the router or conflicted with the school’s Wi-Fi, and put some sort of block on it,” Bender said. 
Another resident, Emma Kenniff, a freshman psychology major, agreed with Bender. “I think it stopped working because of the power outage,” she said.
Bender began facing issues with her Wi-Fi on November 1 and it has since changed her daily routine. “It has definitely put a damper on my ability to complete schoolwork in a convenient manner as I now have to plan out a block of time where I can walk across campus to the library to get access to Wi-Fi,” Bender said. “I cannot send text messages, emails, cannot load any websites, or stream music, unless I disconnect from the Wi-Fi and use the data on my phone.” 
Kenniff has been dealing with the issue since October 25, a week longer than Bender. “It’s annoying because nothing ever loads, so it makes being in the room not enjoyable,” she said. Kenniff is no longer able to do things without proper Wi-Fi access that she could do before, such as going on Blackboard, watching Netflix, or using social media. 
Since the university’s Wi-Fi in residential buildings does not reach students’ rooms, the Wi-Fi routers are all personally bought and owned by the students. “I purchased a very nice, expensive router for my room so that I wouldn’t have to deal with this very issue,” Bender said. It’s because of this, students say, that the situation is so frustrating. “Our dorms should have Wi-Fi to begin with,” Brooke Tanner, a freshman education major, said.
This issue can be fixed. According to Tanner, students can take their routers to the IT department, which can fix blockages that may have occurred after the power outages. “You need to go down there with your router, and they unblock it, so it works [again],” Tanner said.
When asked about the process to clear these blocks and how they occurred in the first place, workers in the IT department told the Pioneer that they were unable to answer questions and that interviews must be scheduled through Michael Berthel, executive dean of students. 
An interview wasn’t granted, but Berthel explained that without specifics he was unable to provide a comment on any issues students may have with their personal routers, but that “internet connectivity and strength is consistently monitored and there are no known issues in the residence halls at this time.”
Berthel encourages students experiencing issues with their routers to reach out to it@liu.edu for assistance.
