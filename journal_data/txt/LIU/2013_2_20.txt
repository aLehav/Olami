It was one of the Pioneers most domi­nating performances of the season. The 102-79 victory over the Mercy Maver­icks on Saturday, February 16 was just what the men’s basketball team needed after the tough 83-79 loss they suffered to the UDC Firebirds earlier in the week.
Saturday’s win over Mercy was the sec­ond time this season that the Pioneers scored 100 or more points in a game. The last time they had done it was back on January 9 when they beat Roberts Wesleyan 100-58.
It was a full 40-minute performance by the Pioneers. It took them less than one minute to gain control of the lead, and the Pioneers did not look back after that. Within three minutes their lead had hit double digits. A three-pointer by senior guard Tobin Carberry at the 14: 45 mark gave his team a 25-11 lead.
Carberry finished the game with a season high 34-point performance, shooting 13-22 from the field and 6-12 from three-point range.
The Pioneers maintained the double digit lead throughout the first half, with their largest lead coming at the 3:36 mark off a bucket from Carberry to give them a 50-30 advantage. The Mavericks managed to cut LIU Post’s lead down to 13, ending the half trailing 54-41.
The second half saw the Pioneers con­tinue their dominance over Mercy. The clos­est the Mavericks came to catching LIU came when they cut their lead to nine early in the half, but they couldn’t do much after that.
The Pioneers put up 48 points in the sec­ond half, 18 of which came from Carberry. By the 8:48 mark the Pioneers’ lead had reached a 20-point margin. Freshman guard Emile Blackman gave his team a 27-point lead, the Pioneers’ largest of the half and game, with two minutes left to play. The Pioneers ended the contest with a 23-point advantage.
Blackman finished the game putting up 23 points in 27 minutes of game time. Sopho­more forward Tyuan Williams and freshman guard Dillon Burns contributed 14 points each and Charles McCann also added eight points.
The Wednesday, February 13 game against the UDC Firebirds was much different in comparison to Saturday.
The Pioneers and Firebirds traded the lead 17 different times and the game came down to the wire.
The first half was a back-and-fourth struggle, as neither team could find a way to separate from one another. The largest lead came at the 10:45 mark when junior guard Michael Terry hit a three-pointer to give the Firebirds a 21-17 lead. Williams would tie the game back up after hitting back-to-back shots.
The two teams continued to trade the lead before the Firebirds ended the half leading 39-36.
UDC controlled the lead for the first five minutes of the second half, before Carberry hit a three-pointer to give the Pioneers their first lead of the half. Allen, Carberry, Burns and Blackman helped ex­tend LIU Post’s lead to nine points with 12 minutes left in the game.
But UDC put together a comeback in the final five minutes with junior guard Ralph Watts tying the game at 74 with 3:21 left to play. The Firebirds would go on a 6-0 run before the Pioneers rallied in the final minute to cut the lead down to one. However, two made free throws by Terry and a missed shot by Burns with 11 seconds ended their chance of coming back. The Pioneers fell to the Fire­birds by a four point margin, 83-79.
Despite the loss, a bit of history was made. For LIU Post, Allen recorded his 1,000th career point as a Pioneer, becom­ing the 21st player to do so in the program’s history.
The Pioneers record now stands at 16-7 overall and 11-4 in East Coast Conference play headed into a matchup with the 5-19 Saint Thomas Aquinas Spartans tonight at the Pratt Center at 7:30. All your Pioneers bas­ketball coverage can be found on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org.

Nemo is no longer solely Pixar’s cute animated clown fish; since last weekend, residents of the Northeast, who named the storm Nemo, will remember it as a blizzard that caused traffic chaos on snowy roads, leaving many snowed into their houses without power. But compared to October’s Hurricane Sandy, this second storm to hit Long Island in just four months was not as dramatic according to Post stu­dents.
On Friday, February 8, it started snowing heavily in the New York area, and LIU Post notified students that the school would close for at least two days, since the snow storm was ex­pected to bring strong winds and more than five inches of snow. The weather conditions imposed great danger on the roads, and people were advised to stay inside and avoid driving. With Hur­ricane Sandy in recent memory, some students were quick to leave campus on Thursday before the snow began when they were noti­fied of the upcoming storm.
Resident student Talia Charlton, a junior Journalism major, went back home to Man­hattan as soon as she heard of the approaching weather. “All I could think of was the two-week-long power outage that our school suffered during Sandy,” she said. “Therefore, I went home straight after class on Thursday, not to risk getting stuck on campus without power.”
Students who did stay on campus say they experienced both negative and positive conse­quences of the blizzard. Waking up to an all-white landscape of ten inches of snow on a Saturday was one positive. “It was a lot of fun to run out and play in the snow,” said Johanna Pettersson, a sophomore Psychology major. According to Pettersson, the biggest problem was getting to and from campus. “My brother was visiting from Sweden and we were going to Manhattan during the weekend. It took us four hours to get to the city by bus and train.”
Closer to the city, the effects of the blizzard were far less signif­icant compared to the conditions on Long Island. Bianca Rahimza­deh, a junior Public Relations student who commutes from Brooklyn, said, “Of course there was a lot of snow, but streets were clean in no time, and I could take the subway everywhere even though there were some minor delays.” When traveling to school on Monday, public transportation ran smoothly from her apartment to campus. “I take the LIRR train followed by the N20 bus, and they ran according to schedule,” she said.
Driving to and from school during the weekend and in the beginning of the week was not as easy though. Eric Palacios, a resi­dent sophomore Pre-Med Biology student, experienced difficulties on the roads and especially in Post’s parking lots.
“Some parts of the roads were icy and there were long lines and when trying to park outside Brookville Hall, the parking lot was icy and not well-cleared at all,” he said. “I had to drive to Pratt and park there.”
Palacios also had trouble when driving to the gas station. “When I heard there was a storm coming, I remembered when gas stations ran out of gas and closed during Hurricane Sandy,” he said. “Therefore I drove to a couple of stations to fill up my tank but by Friday morning some had closed, and at others there were hour-long lines.”
Long lines on the main roads also constituted a problem for students that tried to get to cam­pus by car. “I use Able Ride to get to school, which is a service trans­porting people with disabilities, and they took a little longer than normal,” said Charlie Moerler, a freshman majoring in Electronic Media. But according to Moerler, the worst part of the blizzard was the large quantity of snow. “The day after, we couldn’t even open our front door; my dad and sister spent the entire morning shovel­ing,” he said. “Hopefully the snow melts soon,” he added.

All of music’s biggest stars gathered at the Los Angles Staples Center on Sunday for the 55th annual Grammy Awards. The show was hosted by rapper LL Cool J and featured performances by Justin Timber­lake, Elton John, Bruno Mars, and Rihanna, among others.
Taylor Swift opened the show with an Alice in Wonder­land themed performance. She wore a white circus- leader cos­tume and pranced around stage with a cane, singing her Record of the Year nominated hit- “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”.
Bruno Mars and Sting paid tribute to Bob Marley in a memo­rable performance. The duo sung the Police classic “Walking on the Moon” and was later joined by Rihanna and Ziggy Marley for the song “Could You Be Loved”. Jus­tin Timberlake performed his new song “Suit and Tie” along­side Jay-Z, who casually walked on stage from his front row seat in the audience. The pair both wore sharp black suits with a crisp white button down under­neath. Ed Sheeran performed a much-anticipated duet with superstar Elton John. The pair sang Sheeran’s breakout song “The A-Team”.
CBS Network, which airs the Grammy Awards live on television, put a dress code in place for the first time ever. The dress code was meant for both star guests and performers. The “wardrobe advisory” was made because of previous years when stars have worn revealing costumes during their perfor­mances and outfits on the Red Carpet. The dress code was not enforceable, but was done be­cause CBS Network has received numerous complaints about stars outfits in recent years. The dress code was released a week before the Grammy Awards show and stated rules such as “please be sure that buttocks and female breasts are adequately covered.”
Some stars apparently did not receive the memo and violated the dress code. Kelly Rowland wore a tight fitting black gown that had sheer cut outs going down the dress. Rowland’s dress was completely see-through, exposing most of her body. Jennifer Lopez wore a black one shoulder gown that ex­posed her entire bare leg. These two were definitely not the only stars that did not follow the dress code rules.
“I personally watch the Grammy’s just to see what all the stars wear, the Red Carpet is my favorite part” said Brittney Catal­do, freshman Child Education major. “On a night that millions watch, there should be freedom to wear whatever the celebrities feel they look good in, since everyone is judging them,” she added.
The rock-band Black Keys took home a handful of Grammy’s winning awards in four different nomination categories includ­ing: Rock Performance and Rock Song for the hit “Lonely Boy”, Rock Album for “El Camino”, and Producer of the Year. The cult favorite song “Somebody that I Used to Know” by Gotye featuring Kimbra won for both the Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo.
“I was so excited when my favorite song won,” said Emma Weinstein, junior Social Work major. “It has been a major hit all year, constantly playing on the radio and of course my Ipod,” she adds.
Other awards included “No Church in the Wild” by Kanye West and Jay-Z featuring Frank Ocean and The Dream won for Best Rap/Sung Collabora­tion. Mumford and Son won the Album of the Year award for “Ba­bel”, and the Best Dance/ Elec­tronica Album went to Skrillex for “Bangarang”.
The Grammy Awards is the biggest night in music. The Grammy’s is attended by the most elite music stars and watched by millions worldwide at home. This year, the show was viewed by a record breaking 28 million on CBS, the second largest audience since 1993, ac­cording to CBS.com. The 55th annual Grammy Awards was a night filled with memorable per­formances, award winners, and, of course, fashion.

Beyoncé has been on every­one’s lips this past decade and more than ever now after her recent Superbowl performance. Just this year, which is less than two months old, the “Queen of Everything” as some would say, has sung the national anthem at the Presidential Inauguration, performed at the Super Bowl Half Time Show, released her auto­biographical documentary, “Life Is But A Dream”, and now she is getting ready for her “Mrs. Carter World Tour”. Alongside her hus­band Jay-Z and their child Blue Ivy Carter, Beyoncé has been in the public eye non-stop. It seems like Beyoncé’s reign will never end, whether people like it or not.
Beyoncé started her career with the famous group Destiny’s Child, alongside Kelly Rowland and later Michelle Williams. Their big breakthrough was the single “No, No, No” in 1997. In 2003, Beyoncé released her first solo album, “Dangerously in Love.” Now, a decade later, Beyoncé has been thriving as a single artist with a history of multiplatinum records and 17 Grammy Awards.
At the Presidential Inau­guration Beyoncé decided to lip sync, which upset a lot of people. However, she had a huge come­back at the Super Bowl Half Time Show, with 13 minutes of non-stop entertainment that was 100 percent live. She sang her popular songs from Baby Boy to Halo, with an all female band. During the Super Bowl, she went public with her new Mrs. Carter World Tour that sold out in many cities within an hour.
Martine Malde, a junior Economics major, thinks Beyoncé is an amazing performer. “She is beautiful, strong and indepen­dent. As a public figure, she is a great role model, being profes­sional at all times. She stands for independence and women’s equality by using her music as a tool to empower women of all ages,” said Malde.
Malde thought Beyoncé’s performance at the Super Bowl was amazing. She thinks her performance was a great way for Beyoncé to show her profes­sionalism by taking the show to the next level, and that she was a team player and role model by inviting the other members of Destiny’s Child to join her in the performance. Malde is not the only member of her family who loves Beyoncé; her mom listens to Beyoncé too.
Joella Skoogh, junior Pub­lic Relations major, did not care about Beyoncé until she ended up watching a concert on TV this summer. Skoogh cannot recall what the particular concert was, but she remembers how great it was. She states, “I was just amazed by her stage presence and amazing voice. I couldn’t turn it off!”
Despite the enormous amounts of praise Beyoncé gets, there are some people who think she is overrated. Andria Osler, junior Public Relations major, does not like Beyoncé as a public figure because she does not enjoy her music. “I used to actually like her when she was a part of Des­tiny’s Child because she was sing­ing with two other women. Once she branched out and the other two women disappeared from the public eye, I started to despise her. I felt as if she stole their fame and she was everywhere.” Being aware of how many people disagree with her, she continued, “I don’t want to offend anyone with my opin­ions, but I can’t help the way I feel. I really don’t like her voice, or her music. It is not my style.”
Whatever your feelings to­ward Beyoncé might be, it is hard to deny that she is indeed some­one a lot of people have heard of. But why do people enjoy her so much? What is it that makes her so popular? Osler thinks it’s because of her sexiness and the fact that she can “shake her hips”. However, she thinks Beyoncé is just like every other artist in the mainstream music world.
“I noticed a lot of people like the same type of music these days, even though there is no talent involved, because it has be­come so mainstream,” said Osler.
Skoogh believes that people like Beyoncé because she is so comfortable with herself and keeps out of the tabloids. “She just seems like she has a lot of integrity and also because she is so talented and genuine. She looks like she really enjoys what she does and I think that is hard to dislike about a person.”
Malde thinks it might be because she can really sing and people think she’s beautiful. She said, “She always has a smile on her face and she doesn’t go around and talk trash about other artists. The fact that she is married and has a girl with Jay-Z just makes them even more likable.”
So is Beyoncé overrated? Whatever your opinion about Beyoncé might be, she is here to stay. After all, she is one of the most powerful women in the en­tertainment business today and people will wait eagerly to hear what she plans to do next.

On Friday, February 15, LIU Post had the pleasure of screening the independently produced film “Gimme the Loot” at the Hill­wood Lecture Hall. Students, many of whom attended in class groups, were joined by the director and screenwriter Adam Leon, who spoke about the creative process for the proj­ect. “Gimme the Loot” has stampeded its way through the independent film festival circuit with a Grand Jury Prize for Narrative Fea­ture at the SXSW Festival, an Official Selec­tion at Cannes in France, and Some to Watch at the Independent Spirit Awards. With a limited budget and with non-professional actors, Leon and crew had to be concise film­makers.
Regardless of festival hype, this film has a way about it that makes it one of the more enjoyable offerings made in 2012. Leon introduces the viewer into the world of two young adults, Malcolm (Ty Hickson) and Sofia (Tashiana Washington), who live in the Bronx, and where making a mark on the world through graffiti means success. These determined teenagers conceive a plan to tag an iconic landmark but must raise $500 to fund their stunt. Weaved into their madcap antics to scrounge up the money (sprinkle in some drug dealing and theft) they learn more about their place in the world.
This is definitely not just a graffiti movie. It does not exploit street art in a gim­micky way but uses it as a launching point for a journey. As Malcolm and Sofia navigate their often hostile neighborhood, they dis­cover more than just what happens when you use a spray can on a brick wall. We find strong themes of personal honor, commu­nity, and respect that add levels of depth.
“Gimme the Loot” features some fresh and raw acting by Hickson and Washington. Their conversations on-screen play out like candid photographs from an urban play­ground. The cinematography of the film lends to this realism, with tracking shots following characters down city streets as they casually pitch and swing lingo back and forth. But this approach was not as loose as it seems. Leon claims that “the movie is a little more scripted than people expect” and that those long shots where characters are traveling from location to location were rehearsed tightly to help combat inconveniences such as disruptive passerby and loud noises.
On March 22, “Gimme the Loot” will be released in select theaters. This film was definitely an enjoyable watch, although it may take a little time to get adjusted to the fast talking street lingo of the characters. Keep an eye out for Adam Leon. I think we may be hearing from him soon again.
Verdict: B

As I watched the Pacific Northwest Ballet’s production of “Romeo et Ju­liette” at the N.Y. City Center, its many fight scenes between members of the Capulet and Montague families remind­ed me of similarly-staged scenes in the musical “West Side Story.” After all, the latter is but a ‘re-telling’ of the former. However, at a certain point in “Romeo et Juliette,” the problem dawned on me that Jean-Christophe Maillot’s chore­ography dwelt almost exclusively on the tribulations and exuberances of the story’s young people. In other words, this production reduces the story to nothing more than a series of artfully choreo­graphed brawls between angsty teenag­ers interspersed with scenes of the titular characters madly pining for each other.
At the beginning of the show’s very cinematic-looking opening credits (per­haps my favorite part of the whole pro­duction), there is an image of a building that looks as if it might have been taken straight from a town in medieval Italy where Shakespeare’s original play is set. However, we see more of this connection to the source material in the produc­tion itself. The scenery in this version is an all-white design with giant sliding walls and a winding staircase leading to nowhere, along with scattered furniture that looks as if it was taken directly from an Ikea showroom. Perhaps by using such an abstract display the show is try­ing to highlight the universality of the story’s themes of love and conflict, which are not unique to a medieval Italian set­ting.
In this respect, the production suc­ceeds very well. Nevertheless, all com­pelling stories, such as Shakespeare’s original “Rome and Juliet” are a mix of the universal and the particular.
The main flaw of “Romeo et Ju­liette” is that it takes too much of a ‘big-picture’ view of its subject matter while ignoring the relevant particulars (i.e. setting) which make its source material so unique. After all, there is a reason why Shakespeare titled it “Romeo and Juliet” and not “Scenes of Young People Fighting While Two of Them Experience Doomed Love.”
The effect here is similar to that of the “Peanuts” cartoons where we always see the same characters but never any of their parents (or any other adults for that matter). By removing the particular context of competing families in a me­dieval Italian town, “Romeo et Juliette” ultimately dooms itself by removing the cause of its story’s path, reducing it to nothing more than young people fight­ing in an abstract vacuum devoid of any meaningful connection to time and place.
Pacific Northwest Ballet’s “Romeo et Juliette” was performed at the N.Y. City Center from February 13 – 16.

The LIU Post baseball team begins the 2013 season tomorrow against Stonehill College in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Last year, the Pioneers finished with a 27-20 record and went 16-8 within the East Coast Conference. Earlier in the month the Preseason Poll was announced and the Pioneers were selected to finish third in the conference this season behind Dowling College and Saint Thomas Aquinas College.
Bill Gaffney enters his second season as head coach of the Pioneers and will aim to im­prove off of last year’s performance. Recently, Coach Gaffney was kind enough to answer a few questions to help give a preview of the 2013 LIU Post baseball team:
The Pioneer (TP): Last season was your first at the helm of the Pioneers. You finished with a record of 27-20. Overall, how would you evaluate last season? What were a couple positives about the season? What were some things the team can improve upon? 
Bill Gaffney (BG): Our seasons will only be judged as successful if we are able to reach our goals of winning our conference, advancing to the regionals and making our first trip to the College World Series. With that said, we competed throughout the year and unfortunately fell short in the confer­ence playoffs by losing two one-run games. Last season our pitching staff continued to keep us in ball games and allowed us to win many games by playing small ball and using our speed on the bases to challenge the other teams. Just like many teams, consistency continues to be our challenge. If we are to reach our goals this year we must maintain the pitching and offensive performances from last year and be more consistent in our defen­sive play.
TP: With every new season in college athletics, it means there will be graduating players. Who are a couple of players that you no longer have this season? How can their production be made up? Who will step up for them this year? 
BG: James Stone and Matt Simone are the two most notable losses from last year’s graduating class. Stone, a pitcher, was a 2nd team All-Conference player and Simone was a starting outfielder and backup catcher. We have a few pitchers who will compete for Stone’s innings. In addition to Bo Budkevics and Kevin Chenicek, two standout pitchers from last year, Joe Arena, Mike Eckerle and Rafael Martinez will get the opportunity to so­lidify the rotation. Simone’s role will be filled in the outfield by Angel Pimentel, last year’s second baseman and John Bellock a transfer from Manhattan. Behind the plate backing up Anthony Corona will be Marc Peretzman, who also pitches, Steve Teitel and Ryan Feminella.
TP: What returning players do you feel have the potential to have a breakout sea­son this year? Whoever you feel may have a breakout season, why do you feel that way? 
BG: Mike Eckerle and Joe Arena are two players who should have breakout years. Mike Eckerle is a big left handed pitcher who has seen limited innings because of talented pitching staffs during his first two years at Post. He is a hard thrower who has attracted interest from local scouts. Joe Arena is a sophomore who can potentially play a big role in this year’s team. As a freshman last year, Joe got his feet wet on the mound and showed good potential. All the players have off-season conditioning which helps them to begin the season ready to play.
TP: Are there any freshmen that have the ability to already make an impact in their first season? 
BG: Three freshmen may see significant time this year, two pitchers and a first base­man. Chris Anderson and Christian Stancav­age, both from West Islip High School, both have the talent and the make-up to make an impact on the mound for us this year. Dave Groeneveld, a first baseman from Saint An­thony’s High School, should supply us with a big bat in the middle of the line-up and good defense at first.
TP: What is the outlook for this year’s team? How far can the team go? 
BG: Our goals are always the same as I noted above. We want to be playing in the College World Series and will work each day to achieve that goal. This team has the talent and experience to attain that goal.
TP: Is there an area that you are very comfortable in? Are there any areas of your team where you may have some platooning or position battles going on? 
BG: Our pitching staff has good depth but the front line guys need to stay healthy for us to remain strong throughout the season. Third base and first base are positions that may see various players. Kevin Chenicek, our 3rd baseman, pitches and will also play 1st base to give his arm a rest. At first, in addition to Chenicek and Groeneveld, Anthony Corona our starting catcher and Rawlings Gold Glove region All-Star last year, will go to first to get a break from behind the plate.
TP: What is the biggest key for your ball club to win games? 
BG: Baseball teams, like baseball hit­ters, go through slumps throughout a season. It is important for us to have a team that can be consistent in their play, pick each other up during the low times in the season, and most importantly to believe that they can play with anyone when they are focused on the goal. Our pitchers need to continue their consistent effort on the mound, we need our offense to repeat the performance from last year and our defense [needs] to be more consistent then we were last year.

Dear Readers,
As you can see, this weeks Pioneer is a miniature version compared to the usual magnitude of our issues. This is due in part to the extended weekend we had. However, inside you will find a preview of the baseball season, a review of the screening of the independently produced film “Gimme the Loot”, a feature on the Grammy Awards, as well as other articles. We hope you enjoy this shortened version of the Pioneer and pick up a copy next week, which will include all of your campus news stories. The Bottom Line will also be published next week as an insert in the Pioneer.
Sincerely,
Olivia Wicik and Alex Parker

The women’s basketball team won their second consecutive game after defeating Mercy College on Saturday, February 16 by a final score of 83-56. Senior forward Nicolette Marciniak led the Lady Pioneers (16-7) with 19 points on an 8-11 shooting display from the floor and recorded her 1,000th point of her collegiate career in the process. Marciniak becomes the fifteenth player in the program’s history to join the 1,000 point plateau.
The Mavericks (0-23) were unable to register their first win of the season, but they were able to go into the first half only down seven points: 39-32. The Lady Pioneers played the better second half though as they outscored the Mavericks by 20 points to cruise to a victory.
Three Lady Pioneers joined Marciniak with double-figure points. Sophomore guard Chelsea Williams dropped 15 points and secured six rebounds. In the last game against the University of the District of Columbia, Williams was about as efficient as you could possibly be when she had 17 points on only five shots attempted for the game. Junior guard Alexis Peters stuffed the stat sheet against Mercy as she poured in 11 points, five rebounds, six assists, as well as six steals. Peters has now scored at least 10 points in eight of her last nine games and has aver­aged nearly 16 points per game in her last five contests. Finally, off the bench junior forward Shayna Gatling added 15 points in 16 minutes of action.
Despite going 3-20 from beyond the arc, the Lady Pioneers once again won the turnover battle. Turnovers have been the Achilles heel for this team, but there has been significant improvement since the game against Dowling College back on Post Pride Night on January 30. Prior to the contest against Dowling, the Lady Pioneers had less turnovers than their opponent only five times in 17 contests. But since that win, the Lady Pioneers have edged out their opponent in the turnover battle in five of their last six games. Against Mercy, the Lady Pioneers only had 16 turnovers, whereas they average nearly 21 per game for the season.
Other notable performances in the blow­out by LIU include junior forward Dominique Pagan and freshman guard Quanisha Ratley. Although she did not attempt a shot, Pagan made her presence felt hauling in 10 rebounds and swatting three shots. Ratley chipped in with six points and grabbed seven rebounds.
The Lady Pioneers sit in fourth place in the East Coast Conference. Their next game is tonight against the Saint Thomas Aquinas College Lady Spartans (13-12) who are in fifth place right behind the Lady Pioneers. Tipoff is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. and there will also be pregame coverage at 4:45 p.m. on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org.

On Thursday, February 7, I took a trip to New York City to see the Broadway musical “Wicked.” I have always wanted to see this show ever since it opened on Broadway in October 2003. My expectations were very high. “Wicked” is playing at the Gershwin Theater on 222 West 51st Street. The performance was packed with vis­ibly excited tourists and show-enthusiasts hum­ming tunes from the show.
The first act of the show was slightly dis­appointing and it seemed to me that the actors weren’t quite warmed up to one another on stage. Understudy Donna Vivino, played the witch, Elphaba Thropp, for this performance. Under­studies rehearse their roles equally but don’t get to perform for audiences nearly as often; some­times they don’t get to go on at all. Vivino started off a little slow in the beginning, but eventually warmed up and I was impressed with how she belted the high notes.
Once act two began, the plotline came together and I noticed myself at the edge of my seat. It was intriguing how Winnie Holzman, writer of the musical’s book based on Gregory Maguire’s novel, portrayed the characters and the events that took place prior to Dorothy’s landing in Oz from the old classic “The Wizard of Oz.” Bringing back these characters gave me a sense of nostalgia as I grew up hearing the story of “The Wizard of Oz” from both the movie and the book.
James Hayes, a junior music education major, gave The Pioneer his perspective on the show. “It’s an awesome musical with an impres­sive score, combined with a different perspective on a classic story that everyone knows.”
Each character is portrayed with an un­suspected twist to their background. This depth kept audience members engrossed in the perfor­mance, yearning to learn more about the beloved characters they thought they knew.
“I have seen the show seven times and each time has been even more thrilling than the last,” said Kathryn Brust, a freshman management ma­jor. “No other Broadway show can compare. You haven’t experienced Broadway until you have experienced Wicked!”
Overall, I recommend the show for any fan of the distinguished “The Wizard of Oz” movie, “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” children’s novel written by L. Frank Baumnovel, and all mu­sic or Broadway enthusiasts. If you’ve enjoyed “Wicked” on Broadway, there’s a movie version in development. Universal Pictures bought the rights to “Wicked” and Holzman agreed to write the screenplay.
