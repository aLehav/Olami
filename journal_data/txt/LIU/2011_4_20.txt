The United States of America is built upon a very specific and detailed political system. We all remember learning about the three branches of government and what do in high school. But was that really enough? To graduate from high school every student must have one semester of government and a full year of American history, essentially attempting to cram more than two hundred years of history and politics into a year and a half. This is a very difficult task.
In a brief survey of Post students the answer became clear that that year and a half is not enough time. Not one student could name five signers of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution and most could not name the year that the Constitution was signed. These are very basic facts that most people should know about their own country. Well what about colleges? Don’t they offer something to help teach students more about their country? Most do, including C.W. Post, but they are not mandatory.
And even if you do decided to take one of these courses, it’s still just a semester long which is not enough time to learn the in depth facts. If someone really wanted to learn about these facts they could take the in depth courses as electives, that is if they have time and they are being offered. So what now? How do we get Americans to learn about their country? Simple, make it more part of their education by making more history and government classes mandatory in high schools and by offering more elective classes in colleges.
If a student takes two years of American History in high school and a full year of government, that’s twice the information teachers can teach them. With a slight tweak in the requirements people are already learning double. And if more colleges made history and political science mandatory, students would be able to learn more in just two semesters. Making this possible is just as easy as signing a petition or sending an e-mail to a local state representative. So help make the change and help to educate students on their own country.

We all remember our senior year of high school and when we had to make the decision of what college we would attend.  All of my friends except for me went away to school, but ironically half of them ended up coming back to Long Island for school. For undisclosed reasons, I stayed home although I would have given my soul to go away to school, just for the sole reason of being on my own and meeting different people. Then again, I could do it at a school on the Island. But for you commuter students, what do you think? Do you feel you made the right decision by staying home or do you feel you should have gone away?
I met up with a couple of commuters and was surprised by the results. Junior broadcasting major, Nicholas Vento, said, “I guess I don’t spend much time on campus, but I don’t mind commuting. I didn’t want to go away. If I really want that dorming experience I’ll go visit my friends who go away to school.”
Sophomore broadcasting major Alyssa Clarkin said, “I do spend a lot of time on campus because I’m on the dance team. I feel like if you know your major, when you go to class you see the same people every day, and can connect with them since you’re all going to school for the same thing.”
Freshman undeclared Alex Dimiris disagreed saying, “I would definitely rather dorm at a school. You don’t need to wake up early and drive. It’s nice to have a roommate and make new friends. I know if I stay around Post for next year I’m going to dorm just for the college experience.”
While I can agree with these students, one of the main reasons I stayed home was to work and to be near my family. My little sister was going through high school and I couldn’t abandon her during the four worst years of her life. I also got to work to help my parents pay for my tuition at school, since they are already paying for another college tuition. Whatever your decision of commuting or dorming was, it is possible to get the college experience you desire, it’s what you make of it, so make new friends and go out to local bars. Sometimes it’s nice to show the dormers the way around the Island.

It’s here; it’s finally the end of the semester.  How exciting is that?  As this is the last edition of the Pioneer for the semester, I thought a nice way to wrap up my little community column would be to talk about just that: the community.
A few weeks ago I told you guys about the demographics of the Village of Brookville.  How much homes cost, how many rooms those houses have, and a little bit of information about the people living here.  But how does all of that measure up to C.W. Post? After all, we have a fairly diverse student body, so what is the comparison between the village and the campus that calls it home?
To start off, according to the 2010 census results, in Brookville, women make up 55.1% with 2,152 members of the population whereas men make up only 44.9% coming in at 1,754.  The statistics for Post’s campus follow along the same lines with females accounting for 66% of the population with males only representing 34%.
With a total enrollment of 8,361, Post’s population surpasses that of Brookville’s by 4,456 people (The VOB has a population of 3,905).  So compared to that number, how much more diverse is C.W. Post?  Let’s take a look.
According to campuscorner.com, there are 4,400 white students who attend C.W. Post, making up just over half of the student population.  Compare that to the 3,269 white residents of the Village of Brookville, which accounts for almost 84% of their population.
There are 613 Black/African American students against the 314 people who live in town.
There are 479 Asian students here at Post, with only 238 in Brookville; and while 18
Native Americans attend classes here, there are none that call Brookville home.
These numbers could vary slightly however, as there are an estimated 2,000 students who chose not to claim a specific ethnicity.  Even still, I wonder how it is that in a community that lacks a real sense of diversity a campus can attract such a wide variety of students from all different walks of life.
Whatever the reason, I hope that our school continues to provide a place for such a variety of people to come together.  Good luck to all on your finals, and to those seniors who are graduating, congratulations! I’ll see you all next semester!

If you caught “The Roast of Donald Trump” on MTV a few weeks ago, you now know it is a possibility the famous billionaire may be in the running for the 2012 Presidential Election.
According to the New York Post, Donald Trump is “seriously” considering running for the position. Best known for being the host of “The Apprentice” with that famous catch phrase, “You’re Fired!” and that horrible comb-over, Donald Trump hates what is happening to our country and the economy, as we all do.
It’s tough to say what his plans are regarding changing the circumstances of our country, or whether or not he will make a decent President. Whether you take him seriously or not, the question still stands: If Donald Trump was in the running for the 2012 Presidential Election, would you vote for him? Here’s what some of you guys thought!
Casey Curran, Sophomore, Criminal Justice & Political Science: “I would! I feel like a lot would get done. He knows how to make money, and he could probably bring our debt down.”
Rob Hallam, Freshman, Business: “I probably wouldn’t because I don’t think he has a political background to be President.”
Talent Harris, Freshman, Pre-Pharmacy: “No, because he doesn’t have a lot of political experience.”
Natalie Villanueva, Freshman, Journalism: “I wouldn’t vote for him only because he’s looked at as an icon; someone who can’t be taken seriously. In my opinion he does have adequate experience to run the country.”

His business and music have made him one of the richest rappers in history. Fabolous seemed to be “killin ‘em” at C.W. Post’s Spring Fling concert at the Tilles Center on Friday, April, 15.
This Spring Fling concert was a must-see experience.  Fans were up and off their feet…literally. T-shirts were thrown into the crowd in the hopes that a few lucky people would catch one and hopefully “throw something in their bag.”  Music by DJ Simone Whitney caught the attention of C.W. Post students, and die-hard Fabolous fans eagerly waited for the show to start.  Post Idol winners, Achante Andrews and Anny Jules, sang their hearts away and proved they were true singing sensations as they opened up for Fabolous.
Fabolous finally appeared on stage and looked dressed to impress. He looked mysterious, as his shiny golden sunglasses hid his face and his Tigers jacket gave him that extra oomph to his rapper image. Screams and shouts filled the air, as people were bumpin’ and grindin’ to the music. And, as the show proceeded, it seemed as if everyone was trying to make his or her way towards the stage, just so they could get a little bit closer to Fabolous. The only people who were stopping students from coming an inch closer to Fabolous were security personnel.
Fabolous sang songs like “You Be Killin ‘Em,” “So Into You,” “Throw It in the Bag,” and “Imma Do It.”  He performed for an hour. As the concert came to an end, Fabolous clearly showed off his passion and true dedication he has for music. Just as Fabolous would say, this was, “My Time.”

It is not very often that C.W. Post has seen a performer with as much status in the world of hip-hop. As soon as fliers were put up that Fabolous would be ACP’s spring fling concert performer, students buzzed with excitement until the moment he came on stage, Friday, April 15th.
Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, John David Jackson, aka Fabolous, started his career as a rap artist at the age of 18.  He quickly became successful with his album Ghetto Fabolous in 2003.  Since then Fabolous has continued to rise to the top with countless hit singles such as “Make Me Better,” “So Into You,” “Baby,” and his most recent hit, “You Be Killin Em” on the album There is No Competition 2: The Grieving Music EP.
After much anticipation, Fabolous started his performance at around 10 p.m. The energy among students remained consistent throughout his entire time on stage.  Within the course of an hour Fab played a multitude of hits, keeping the atmosphere as vibrant as ever.  As the final song ended, it became clear that Fabolous is a rare artist who will continue to produce music that makes him stand out from the rest.   And the Pioneer had the opportunity to celebrate this success with an exclusive interview.  Read on!
Q: You’ve been an artist for over 10 years now.  How do you think hip-hop has changed since you started?
A: The business has changed but I don’t think it’s compromised the music. Technology has made it possible for people to make music on their laptops; people can start making music at a younger age.  Overall, any game changes especially with the times, new products, new ideas, new artists.
Q: In a January interview you made a comment about your “You Be Killin Em” music video, basically saying how your intentions were to bring more art into music videos again as opposed to what we are used to seeing today.  Can you expand on that?
A: I like to make creative videos not just the typical things you see day to day.  We have a couple exciting things though, the girl slits the guy’s throat and blows a truck up. We didn’t make a movie out of it but we had a couple of key things that seperate it from the rest.
Q:  Who have been some of your major influences?
A:  Most of the rappers from Brooklyn like Biggie and Jay Z because they are the most relatable to me.  We all have a connection because we all came from the same walks of life.  But in life in general, my mom definitely.  My uncle gives me a lot of insight, but I also pick up pieces of advice from people along the way.  Sometimes a random person can give you something that’s key.
Q: Would you still consider yourself a student to the game?
A: I am definitely still a student, especially on the technical side in the studio. I’m learning something every day.  These kids that grow up with it are learning it so fast, so I am forced to learn with them.
Q:  You have a Twitter; so many celebrities do today.  Do you feel these social networking sites enhanced or helped in your career?
A:  I think it’s given people a little taste of my personality.  Besides just the music aspect, just joking around, not taking life as seriously, is fun.  It’s gotten me into trouble sometimes, not serious trouble, but it’s also brought some things I would never expect. Comedy Central wanted me to be a part of the Tosh. O show just because of something I’ve said on Twitter.  So I guess it works, it has its good’s and bad’s.
Q: So, did you like performing at C.W. Post?
A: I did.  The crowd was energetic; they seemed like they were ready for me.
Q: Do you prefer the smaller venue?
A: It’s more intimate; I like it sometimes when they’re right at your feet.  I like the action too, it’s more personal and gets people more involved.
Q: What advice do you have for kids with the same dreams as you had?
A:  Stop dreaming.  No, I’m joking. Stay determined; stay focused on what you want to do, learn your craft. Don’t go into something thinking you’re just going to learn as you go. There are people who learned before you, so learn from them. Take their bad experiences and don’t make the same mistakes.  There’s going to be non-believers and doubters but just keep pushing until you get the success that you want.
Q: And we just have to ask, how’d you come up with the name “Fabolous”?
A: It actually was given to me by mistake.  DJ Clue thought that was my name because I said it in a rap, so he went around and told everyone.  More and more people started calling me that and it would have been harder to continue correcting them. I also didn’t have a name yet; I was using my first initial “J” but I don’t think that would have been as good.
Q: Well, do you like it?
A: I mean it worked! It stands out; I’ve gone this far with it.
Make sure to check out Fab’s new album coming out April 21st, The S.O.U.L Tape, which is said to be hip-hop soul inspired.  You can follow Fabolous on Twitter at myfabolouslife.

The C.W. Post women’s lacrosse team began the week with victories over Queens College at home and then on the road against Molly, before running into a wall against Stone Hill College.
Post had won five straight games heading into their match up against Queens College at Hickox Field. The Pioneers extended that streak, by jumping out to an early 5-0 lead; they never looked back, powering past the Knights 17-8. The Pioneers scored 14 of their goals in the first half of the blowout victory.  Lauren Spagnoletta and Jackie Sileo had six and five points each, while Nan Mayott added a hat trick of her own.
The Pioneers played another game just two days later, this time a night game, at Molloy College in Rockville Centre. Once again, C.W. Post jumped out to an early lead and Molloy never got the chance to fight back into the game. In the first half it was the Pioneers’ game, beating up on Molloy to gain a 13-5 lead. The second half was even better for the road team, shutting out the Lions while scoring five goals to finish off the win 18-5. Jackie Sileo had 10 points in total, while Lauren Spagnoletta and Michelle Fucich added four and three goals.
The Pioneers’ seven-game win streak came crashing to a halt against Stone Hill on the road. The Skyhawks came into the game ranked fifth, and the Pioneers just one notch below at sixth. This was a crucial matchup for the Pioneers with playoffs just around the corner. The Pioneers jumped out to an early 2-0 lead with goals from Jackie Sileo and Brie Claire Drost, but unlike in other games, the Pioneers could not hold the Skyhawks off. Stone Hill scored the next three goals to take a one-goal advantage, but the scoring for the half was not over. The Pioneers managed to score another three goals while the Skyhawks would also add another two, so the two teams went into the half all tied up at five.
The Skyhawks opened up the second half with three straight goals. The Pioneers attempted to make a comeback, adding one of their own but Stone Hill threw another three goals on the scoreboard to lead it 11-6. The Pioneers made their best attempt to get into the game closing the game to two before time ran out. The 11-9 loss was just the second of the season for the Pioneers.
The Pioneers have six more games before the regular season closes out to gain some ground in the polls.

As the panic from the recent virus outbreak winds down, students have begun to wonder what was the real cause of this illness.  In our last issue, students voiced their concerns over the food in Winnick Hall.
In recent weeks, all students have been e-mailed a request to fill out a health survey. The survey asked students to detail their activities, food intake, interactions etc. According to Nancy Marksbury, the Deputy Chief Information Officer at C.W. Post, the questions were compiled by the Nassau County Department of Health. “The questions were developed at the request of the Nassau County Department of Health to gather the best data possible to determine the possible cause of the stomach virus,” Marksbury said. “All information collected by these surveys is maintained with the utmost care for student privacy in accordance with University adherence to FERPA guidelines and our commitment to protecting student information.”
William Milford, Director of Student Health, reported only 16 cases in most recent weeks. “The reported cases seem to be winding down. As yet, to my knowledge, the Nassau County Health Department has not reported final conclusions from the testing they have done,” Milford added. “The current medical thought is that this is a stomach virus similar to what is being seen in the surrounding counties.”
While the Department of Health was not immediately available for comment, it has been made clear by administrators that the Department of Health is conducting a full on investigation of the illness. It was at first thought that this illness was due to the food in Winnick Hall. However, according to Shawn Carvajal, director of C.W. Post Dining Services said that early medical reports show that this was not a food-borne illness. “Dining Services always works closely the Nassau County Department of Health and follows stringent guidelines for food safety,” Carvajal said. The drinking water on campus has also been tested and has come back as negative for contamination.
For more information on how to prevent illness on campus, please contact the Student Health Center at (516) 299-2345.

The C.W. Post softball team is on an eight-game win streak after having won each of its four games last week, on Thursday, April 14 and Saturday, April 16.  The team has dominated its opponents, defeating their competition by an average of over nine points over the course of the past eight games, even walking away with a 23-0 win over the Northern Boulevard rival-New York Institute of Technology Bears.
Thursday’s matchup pitted the Pioneers against Southern Connecticut State University.  In the first game of the day’s doubleheader, C.W. Post blew the Owls out of the water 12-4.  The game was close until the sixth inning, when the Pioneers’ offense came to life.  C.W. Post scored eight runs on seven hits in the top of the inning, opening a 12-3 gap.  One more run for S.C.S.U. finalized the score at 12-4 to end it.  Senior Christina Berardi got the win for the Pioneers, allowing just seven hits over six innings and striking out six, while freshman third baseman Nicole Hagenah crushed her second grand slam of 2011.
The second game was a much closer competition.  C.W. Post started the scoring off early when freshman leftfielder Carly Chamberlain scored from second off of a single to left field by Hagenah.  The Owls managed to pull ahead in the third, but lost the lead in the sixth when the Pioneers scored three quick runs, making the score 4-2.  Again, S.C.S.U. managed to put one more run on the board before the final out of the game but, again, the effort was too little too late.  Senior pitcher Sarah Kiser earned the 4-3 win for the Pioneers, her 12th of the season.
The Pioneers look good heading onto the week and a half of their season, currently boasting a 26-8 overall record, 12-4 in conference play.  The team takes the field next Thursday, April 21, at home in a rematch against rival N.Y.I.T.

Jackie Coyne has appeared in all 11 games this season for the Pioneers women’s lacrosse team.  A solid member of the C.W. Post defensive unit, Coyne has been a part of the Irish National team, where she has had the opportunity to play for Team Ireland and help to teach the game to native Irish players. The Pioneers are 9-2 thus far, and have been ranked sixth in the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Associations weekly poll, for the week of April 10th.  The Post Pioneers are back in action this Friday, April 22nd, when they face Adelphi home at 4pm.
How long have you been playing at Post?
This is my fourth and final season.
What did you first think about Post?
I thought it was a beautiful campus and when I met the girls that I would be playing with I admired how close they were with each other, and I knew I would love it here. It was also nice and close to home!
How do you feel about Post now?
I absolutely love it here! I have created a lot of memories here with my close friends and teammates. I am going to miss it so much.
What is the best memory you have with the team?
Beating Adelphi on their field in 2010!
What do you want to do after Post?
I will be student teaching next fall and then I will start the job hunt around the island!
What will you miss from Post?
I will miss my teammates the most! We do absolutely everything together and they are like my sisters. Also I am just going to miss the athletes from the whole athletic department. Everyone is constantly supporting each other at games and even off the field.
How has being on Irish National team affected you on and off the field?
It was such a great experience playing for Team Ireland. I got a chance to play with Division I lacrosse players and C.W Post alumni who taught me so much during our trip. I also got a chance to help the native Irish players improve their game, which was very rewarding for me as well. Being on Team Ireland brought me to Dublin, Ireland and also Lahti, Finland so the traveling was a great experience as well!

After their overtime loss nearly one month ago to Dowling College, the C.W. Post Men’s Lacrosse team has now won four consecutive games and has an outstanding 13-1 record for the season. This last week, the Pioneers breezed past two opponents in double-digit victories. The first win came against Wheeling Jesuit University by a score of 14-3, and the most recent victory came versus Lake Erie College 15-5.
Going back to the April 13th road matchup versus the Wheeling Jesuit University Cardinals, the Pioneers jumped out to a quick lead that they never let go of for the remainder of the game. The Pioneers started the game off with four goals, giving them an early 4-0 advantage. The scoring was well balanced in the first quarter as multiple players for Post found the back of the net. Senior midfielders John Wood and Jimmy Johnston scored the first two goals of the contest, followed by sophomore attacker Justin Patterson and junior midfielder Keith Rodriguez each adding a goal of their own.
After senior midfielder Brad DeSouza’s goal late in the first quarter made it 5-1 in favor of the Pioneers, C.W. Post’s leading scorers for the season went on a scoring spree. Junior attacker Eddie Plompen and senior midfielder Mike Messina each tacked on two goals to give the Pioneers a comfortable 9-2 lead at the half.
But Plompen and Messina both were not finished yet. Plompen added two more goals to finish with a total of four goals on the day. Messina found the back of the net once more and finished with a hat trick. The Pioneers went on to shut out the Cardinals 5-0 in the third quarter to lead to an easy 14-3 win.
The Pioneers next game came against Lake Erie College (4-6) on Saturday at Hickox Field. Right from the start, you could tell that this game was going to be all Pioneers. At the end of the first quarter, the score was again 5-1 with the Pioneers leading over the Storm. Plompen continued to get his way with the opposing defense, as he scored three goals in the first quarter. He added two more goals during the blowout, and now has 42 goals for the year.
The Pioneers led 10-4 at the break, and never let the Storm get within reach throughout the rest of the game. The second half was more defensive-oriented than the first, as the Pioneers scored five goals in the second half and only allowed the Storm to find the back of the net once more. The final resulted in a lopsided victory as the Pioneers cruised to a 15-5 victory. In the win, five players for the Pioneers had at least two goals. Plompen led the charge with five, Johnston and Patterson each had a hat trick, and Messina and senior attacker Nick Coric each added two goals to lead the Pioneers to an easy win.
The ECC-leading Pioneers’ next game comes against Mercy College (10-1) who is currently in second place right behind the Pioneers. Mercy will host the Pioneers on Saturday at 12 p.m. The last time these two teams met, the Pioneers had the upper-hand winning 12-3.

I feel very confident that our team can go back to Baltimore and bring home a third championship to C.W. Post in 2011

Our motives dictate the climate of our relationships. Good motives are those that are put forth with honestly. The bad motives are always hidden. We classify the bad guys (or girls) and the good guys (or girls) by their motives and how they go about accomplishing them. No gender is immune to these behaviors. The reality is that we all have an agenda, whether or not we’re forthcoming about it is usually the dealmaker or deal breaker.
Recently, in the shower (where I get all my great ideas), I thought of an analogy. I thought to myself that bad guys run sprints, and good guys run marathons. When I say “guys,” I am referring to ladies as well. Bad guys are people who have bad or dishonest intentions and, in turn, get quick results. The bad guys seemingly don’t suffer the same emotional distress as the good guys do. “Everyone knows that all girls go through their ‘bad boy stage.’ But, what many people don’t realize is that this phase extends well on into their early 20s and college years. So, when we say good guys have to run a marathon, it also has to do with the type of girls they are dealing with, and a level of maturity and time, period,” says junior Vickie Cadestin. Vickie went on to say, “Just as it is hard to find a good guy out there, it’s just hard to find a good girl because most girls haven’t reached that level of maturity. That’s why it’s easier for women to give into these so-called ‘sprinters’ because they know what they have to offer, and it’s already out on the table. Most girls don’t want to take the time out to learn about these bad guys before they get into something serious.”
To deceive someone eventually leads to getting caught if you’re careless. Your bad guys usually dont care enough to at least be careful. These people are usually shortsighted, which leads to quick results and quick demises. Chances are that bad guys have lust-based motives. Within these lust-based motives, many times people’s best interests are not at heart. I’m not calling it right or wrong, it’s just more of an issue of being up front about intentions.
As a good guy, you’re automatically in a little more of a vulnerable state from jump street, being that you may be more inclined to become emotionally involved. When I refer to good guys and marathons, it means they really do win in the long run, and that’s their motives. “Based on my experiences, I wouldn’t say good guys get good results in the long run. Your bad guys will always have an advantage; since they don’t get emotionally involved, they can never really be hurt,” says junior Schavon Greene. A good guy’s motives are honest but, sometimes, can be overlooked. Motives are really the name of the game, and they dictate longevity of relationships as well. When motives are based less on lust and more on genuine interest and care, you are looking at a way more healthy relationship. These elements can also breed into possible love.
So, what’s the result? Your bad guys get what they want, and they probably get it quick. Ultimately, their credibility is in question, and they hurt good people in the process. They lose respect from those affected or even from their peers. The good guys stay true to themselves. They take the licking, but, I believe, they are ultimately appreciated. Junior Anny Jules said, “I see myself as one of the good ones who continuously get attracted to bad guys who are inconsistent with their love.” She also said that, “of course, in the heat of the moment, you say good people finish last, and I don’t want to be good; however, when you sit back and think about your worth, you realize you are the bigger person, and, in time, you will get much better if you allow yourself to do so.”
Good guys are different; they’re more compassionate and are stronger than you may think. My moral for you is to be a respectable man or woman and be straight up about your intentions. As we get older, we have a responsibility to each other to manage each others’ emotions as we’d like ours handled. This too is a practice, but you have to start somewhere.
I thank you all for reading this semester, as this is my final issue of my column and of my college career. Enjoy your summer; shout outs to this class of 2011.

As many of you know, internships are a part of college, and they are very helpful in helping students pick their future careers.  Internships look really good on your resumes when looking for jobs.
One thing that concerns students when looking for internships is the kind of experience they will gain from them and if they will get paid for their work or not. When students sign up for internships, they are devoting a lot of their time to the companies they will be working for. Although they will not get paid a salary like employees of a regular full-time job, they are still supposed to get some money for their work. Working in an internship without pay is considered exploiting; there have been many debates over this, namingly in a recent New York Times article, which came to the conclusion that, even if it’s not a weekly or bi-weekly paycheck, interns should get some sort of reimbursement. Re-imbursement can be in the form of school credit or a travel or lunch stipend.
I spoke with Alice Baumer, the is the associate director of Cooperative Education. At C.W. Post, Baumer gave me a lot of helpful information and cleared up many questions that I had about the Co-op program. The first, and most important, fact was that the Co-op program offers all students an opportunity to gain valuable work experience that helps them work towards their major, and it’s available for students to apply for as early as freshman year. Most of the opportunities at C.W. Post are paid positions, so student will be able to earn some money.
At the Co-op and Career Services Office, there are also co-op counselors to assist you in finding the right internship for you and to help you reach an agreement between the employer and yourself, so you are not being exploited. They are very dedicated to making sure that the students at C.W. Post have the best experiences throughout their entire internships and are not sold short. All of the employers that students are assigned to have been screened by the co-op counselors, so they are very knowledgeable on whom they assign students to.
Co-op internships are zero credit on transcripts, so, as students, we don’t have to pay any extra money for the internships we choose to go with. Most importantly, the name of the companies that you choose to work for will appear on your transcript. The companies are not local companies that you don’t hear of; they can vary from local government offices to MTV, so there are a wide variety of companies to choose from. There is also no limit on how many internships you wish to do over your college career.
Baumer said that there is a program to help you find your job. “The Cooperative Educations and Internship Office also offers the Experience Enriched Education (EEE) seminar every semester. It’s a free, zero-credit seminar that teaches resume writing, interview skills, workplace etiquette and how to find an internship. These are offered in the middle of each semester and are an hour long for a total of four weeks.”
Personally, I was very interested in doing one or two internships before I graduate, and I did not know where to start. After speaking with Alice Baumer and getting more information, I am very interested in doing an internship now. I think everyone should do at least one internship before he or she graduates. It looks great on your transcripts, and employers will be looking to see that you have experience in the area you choose to go into. We also don’t have to pay for these internships, which makes it even better because, as college students, we are on a budget.
All of the co-op counselors are trained experts in their fields and are more than willing to help you find the right internship for you. They will make sure that you have a great experience as well.

From April 12th to April 16th, two fine arts seniors, Trevor Ray and Francis Maguire, showcased their work in an exhibit at the Hillwood Student Art League. On Wednesday, April 13th, an opening reception took place from five to eight p.m., at which these students’ artworks were formally acknowledged. A handful of guests attended the event, which included friends, relatives, colleagues, faculty members as well as a brief visit from Provost, Dr. Forestell. Although the philosophies present in the exhibits differed in content, they both had an underlying theme involving a person’s nature and character.
Ray’s art exhibit which was entitled “You Can’t Run From Your Problems” was based on the combination of video, and graphic design to elucidate the importance of confronting life’s difficult challenges. Ray said, “in my Senior Art Show, I created a video comic book, telling a story of humanism vs. conscience to show how important it is to deal with parts of life that you would sometimes rather not.”
The video comic book, which lasted for about five minutes, was a compilation of his graphic designs in action. Those who attended the event were caught in awe in the number of Ray’s flips and the way he performed these high jumps that were illustrated in the video.
Travis Ray, a physical education major, said, “It was awesome because he has a good video that portrays his artwork.” Furthermore, Ray added that the art movement known as Parkour inspired his senior art show Ray went on to say, “the reason I chose to use Parkour is, even though you can’t run from your problems, Parkour disciplines one’s mind to take the right path in life.” This progressive development of ideas in Parkour’s art movement entails “clearing your mind and processing your thoughts to overcome fears, discomforts, or any other problem that is holding you back from achieving what you desire.”
Maguire’s senior exhibit, “Importunate Individuality,” was about the ways individualism is not highly emphasized in today’s society. “The individual fails to recognize importance to the ‘whole,’ because [he or she] is too concerned with [himself or herself] and [his or her] personal advancement,” Maguire said.
This logic is conveyed through a series of monotypes, which are printed from pictures painted in oil color and printing ink. These images convey the concept of the “group” and the “whole.” Maguire said that each monotype or image “is made to represent the individual and their contribution to the overall image (the group).”
Students at the reception found this concept very intriguing. Particularly, Ojay Burgess, an electronic media major, said, “the artist is unique and inspired by something crazy in his mind. No matter who you are you can relate to something [in his art exhibit].”

The C.W. Post baseball team defeated the Concordia College Clippers on Sunday, their first game action in a week. This past week the Pioneers went into the non-conference part of their schedule. The Pioneers were scheduled to play three games this week against Bloomfield and Dominican College but both were cancelled due to inclement weather. The weather on Sunday wasn’t any better as the Pioneers played through the elements to capture their seventh victory of the season.
Freshman pitcher Mike Eckerle made his first collegiate start, going 1-2-3 in the first inning. Both teams were held scoreless in the first until Concordia struck for three runs in the top of the second inning on two singles and a bases loaded walk. Eckerle settled down after that inning allowing five hits and striking out five in five strong innings of work to pick up his first collegiate win. In the top of the third inning, the number-four hitter for Concordia popped up a foul ball heading towards the Concordia dugout. The ball seemed to be out of play when sophomore Kevin Chenicek made what has to be one of the top plays all year by reaching over the roof of the dugout and falling into the Concordia bench while holding onto the ball to make the improbable catch. Chenicek’s catch brought a little momentum to the Pioneer offense as Post scored five runs in the bottom of the fourth inning. Sophomore catcher Anthony Corona knocked an RBI double to score freshman Rich Maccarone for the first run of the inning. Sophomore outfielder Dan Burnett added a double of his own to score another, and freshman Tom Tolan  drove in senior Joe Mare to score the fifth run of the inning.
Post went on to add two more runs in the sixth, while striking out three more in the eighth inning. Sophomore Ryan O’Kelly added three shut down innings allowing only one run, while junior Bo Budkevics came on to pitch a perfect ninth. Dan Burnett led the Pioneer offense with a flawless 4-4 game scoring a run and notching two stolen bases and an RBI. The Pioneers get back to conference play this week against Mercy College.

College. When you hear that word, so many thoughts may come to your mind.  Greek life, new friends, parties, or, perhaps, a chance to live on your own are just a few of those thoughts. Speaking of your own personal freedom, living on campus can be exciting and new, but C.W. Post students are not always happy with the dorm buildings they live in.
There are many dorm buildings to choose from, but they are not all the same and cannot always accommodate all of your basic needs to live comfortably. For example, most students understand that they are not living in a five-star luxury hotel and that not all the residential buildings allow students to control their own heat and air conditioning. Residential buildings, such as Brookville Hall and the South Residence Complexes, also known as the suites, are two buildings that do have their own thermostats, where you have opportunity to adjust the temperature for a warm or cold atmosphere. The quads, including Kings, Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk, as well as Post Hall and Riggs Hall, do not have this option.
Amanda Randazzo,  a sophomore Italian education major, stayed overnight at her friend’s dorm in the suites. Randazzo said, “It was the beginning of the semester, and  it was really hot out, so my friend put the thermostat on 62 degrees. Even though I woke up the next morning with frost bite, I was happy to be cold and bundle[d] up in sweatshirts, rather than sleeping in a room with no airconditioning or a tiny fan. This is one of the reasons I do not live on campus because I know I am not always going to get a dorm I can be comfortable in.”
Many students feel that if one or two dorms have their own thermostats, then the rest of the dorms should as well. William Kirker, the director of  facilities services, and Gina Bigelow, the associate director of public relations, said, “In terms of students’ concerns about having the ability to control thermostats in individual rooms, it is important to know that residence hall buildings were constructed with HVAC systems that do not allow for independent control. To address this would be cost-prohibitive and would require spending millions of dollars.”
Randazzo’s experiences raise the question of whether or not dorm buildings need to be updated or renovated. Although you may have heard the saying that size and looks are not everything, they are, apparently, when it comes to living on campus.  Aside from the suites, not all dorm buildings have the same size rooms. For instance, you may be put in a typical double or get lucky and feel as if you just won the jackpot and get a corner room, which happens to supply more room because it’s typically wider. Some dorms have carpet in them, whereas other students may be forced to buy a rug because the hard floor itself can get dirty and can be uncomfortable to walk on.
Kirker and Bigelow also responded and said, “This summer, Facilities  Services will renovate bathrooms in the red and green areas of the South Residence Complex. In addition, all rooms in the green section will be painted, and all carpets will be removed and replaced with tile flooring. In Brookville Hall, three bathrooms will be completely renovated in the north wing, as well as 50 rooms in Queens and Suffolk halls, which includes freshly-applied paint, removal of carpet, and new furniture. Lastly, Riggs Hall will receive a new entrance staircase and a handicapped ramp.”
Then again, the issue of furniture may get in your way…literally. Not all dorms allow students to re-arrange their rooms as they would like to. For instance, some students bunk their beds to try to have more room for a television or even a video game area. Also, movable furniture allows students to change the room up by moving their dressers and desks to make the room more spacious and for a more homey feeling.
Some students also want the dorms to be updated so each building can include a kitchen area, not just a microwave. Due to the fact that microwaves are prohibited in a student’s room, they are located on the bottom floor. Some students become frustrated because they do not want to carry their food  downstairs just to simply heat it up.  This may involve a student having to stop what they are doing and put on appropriate clothing to go down and microwave, because who knows who they will run into? Sam Tenadu III, a senior environmental science major, chose to live in Post Hall because the microwaves are on each floor, as well as the laundry machines.
A student who chooses not to have his name mentioned, strongly believes the  chool should enforce the smoking policy. This student said, “I live in Brookkville Hall, and every night, my room stinks like cigarettes, even when my window is closed. I can’t sleep, and I can’t breathe. It is not right for people who are trying to sleep [and] do work, and [it is] inconsiderate for those who have asthma or simply cannot stand the smell.”
Staying clean and, at least, trying to be germ-free is another issue students  truggle with. Some bathrooms are newer that others, and, at this point, the only thing students can do is pray that the janitors will try their best to keep them clean. Some students claim the bathrooms have mold and bugs on the ceilings and the toilets are not always clean. Chelsea Serra, a sophomore enviormental science major, has quite a lot to say. Serra says, “I live in Suffolk, and the bathrooms are gross and disgusting; a renovation is desperately needed.” She continued, “The sinks are all different; only a few of them get hot water. Most of the  doors on the stalls in the bathroom do not lock, and the toilets are [the] oldest on campus, where only a few of them are non-automatic.” A majority of students may have similar living conditions to Serra’s. “Make the school renovate the bathroom,” Serra added.
Facilities Services has not been made aware of mold and bugs nor of a hot water malfunction. The department claims bathrooms are vigorously cleaned daily, and it is committed to providing a welcoming and clean environment for all resident students.
People are not always going to be happy with what they have in life and, sometimes, have to make the best of each situation. The question is, if so many  students pay thousands of dollars to live on campus, why can’t dorms be updated and renovated to make students happier, instead of dealing with problems over and over again that seem to never change?

Small parasitic insects that feed on human blood, sounds like something you would only hear in a horror movie. But these pests are real and have been given the name bed bugs, for the sole fact that they manifest in your bed and feed off of their host.
The Office of Residence Life and Student Health and Counseling posted a flyer up around campus called “Bed Bugs 101” during the spring semester.  The fliers included the main facts students must know about bed bugs, how to manage them and what to do if a student finds bed bugs or was bitten.
Simple precautions can help prevent this nightmare from happening to students. It only takes one bed bug to latch onto a student’s clothing until their bed and room is infested. In places like dorm buildings, it is likely that once one room is infested then the insects can move from one room to another. This is also true with hospitals, hotels, apartment buildings and shelters, the common trend being the close living conditions.
Although C.W Post had a bed bug scare this semester there was no press release or other information about the scare to inform students, other than the fliers that appeared in the dorms. “I’ve heard about the scare through friends but it’s not really a worry to me. I clean my sheets often and keep clean so I do my part to try and prevent it,” said Jimmy Bare a sophomore. Although hygiene has little to do with preventing bed bugs it doesn’t hurt to wash your sheets often.
“Out of our 1,600-bed capacity, we have encountered a limited number of cases. The Division for Student Affairs and the Facilities Services department remain proactive and committed to the safety and well-being of our students,” said Amy Urquhart the Assistant Provost for Student Affairs.
Post is not the only school to have had bed bug scares this semester. Recently Adelphi University had to treat a dorm room after three students complained for five days about the bed bugs. Hofstra, another local university also had a bed bug scare; two dorm rooms were treated for the nocturnal biting insects.
“Everyone should defiantly be alerted, especially because it’s concerning our health and safety. Students who complain about bed bugs should have their rooms inspected and new beds ordered,” said Tatiana Lampa a sophomore living on campus.
The Infirmary will not release any information about the scare on campus but they did confirm that students have been arriving with complaints and concerns of what look like bed bug bites on their skin.
Just using chemical treatments will not get rid of the infestation, so contact the Student Health Center at (516)299-2345 if you have any concerns or feel that bed bugs have hitchhiked their way into your dorm. To prevent bed bugs, try sealing your mattress and pillows with a plastic zip cover. It’s been said that adult bed bugs can survive for over twelve months when feeding off their hosts, so the plastic zip cover can help trap and eventually kill bugs before they reach your skin. When checking to see if your bed has been infected, look in areas that are dark; for instance in your beds creases and seams. Bed bugs like to be hidden, which is why they mainly feed at night when you’re sleeping. To avoid this nightmare from happening to you, follow all precautions to stay clear of bed bugs.

I always imagined what I’d write in my last “letter from the editor” but then again I never even imagined I’d be writing a first.  This job has taught me more than any class I’ve ever taken and I feel lucky to have had this opportunity.  I did not expect to love it as much as I did (still do) and leaving the Pioneer will be more than bittersweet.
 
To my staff (both past and present):  It has been an honor working with you.  I can only hope you’ve learned as much from me as I’ve learned from you.  I wish you the best of luck in your future.  Keep on writing and the power of the pen alive!
To the readers: The re-launch of the Pioneer would not have been as successful if it weren’t for your support…even your criticism.  As Kayla and I said in our very first letter, this is your paper; you have every right to tell us what you want in it.  Our only goal was to create something worthy for the student-body, created by the student-body.  My successors and I promise to keep it that way.
To our advisor: Day in and day out you have shown true dedication and leadership to our student newspaper. You have never strayed in teaching us the value of college newspapers and their influence.  I can assure you these are life lessons that will remain with us forever.  This paper would not be the same without you; I would also not be the same without you.
In the last issue of the Pioneer this semester, we have loads of coverage for you.  Curious about the front-page picture? This news story is a must-read for all of you who live on campus.  Trust me.  We also have a follow up story about the stomach virus that happened in the beginning of the year.  Read on for those of you who got sick. Thanks to ACP, the spring fling concert was a hit!  Fabolous performed at the Tilles last Friday night and we have exclusives on how that went. Feeling gloomy about finals? Check out the collage on page 12 – it’s definitely our prettiest yet!
We’ve also included another issue of the Bottom Line this week! Read about the latest in world news.  And as always, thank you for picking up this issue of the Pioneer.  It has been an absolute pleasure. The Pioneer will be back in September.
CONGRATS SENIORS 2011! We did it!

The Student Government Association held its weekly general meeting held on April 12 in Hillwood Commons.  Present at the meeting were the executive board which are President, Jared Ciborowski; Vice president, Alexandra Hochstrasser; Treasurer, Jill Scionti; Executive Officer, Gina Oseguedo; and Secretary, Jerimida Sanders.  Also, the members of the committees of academic, diversity, campus quality and security and food were present.  A representative of each student club was there as well.
During the president’s report, he announced that for the fall semester of 2011 that there will be a high definition television channel that will be used to broadcast events that will happen within campus.  The PTV crew will be shooting events with high definition technologies for the semester.
For the duration of the Vice President’s report, she announced that an organization, Textbook Rebellion, will be rioting to have more textbooks in the library to take out instead of buying them.  Many students agreed to this argument knowing that textbooks can be really expensive.  To find out more about this cause, log on to www.textbookrebellion.org and they have a facebook page and just look them up by their name. Hochstrasser also announced that the library hours will be extended for finals week.
There was a special presentation given by Jeanette Murray after all the reports.  She encouraged everyone the service surveys that can be found in your LIU accounts.  The service survey is about the person’s personal engagement in community service.  Your submission of you survey will automatically qualify you for participation in a raffle for an ipod touch or book vouchers.  Each student will receive two more reminders and the last day to fill out the survey is on April 22.
A prospective book club is for those who love books in general.  The book club will nourish in incorporating a relaxed environment and making future programs.  The book club has 6 members so far and plans to meet every Thursday.
As for future events, the Thursday before finals start, April 28, there will be midnight breakfast at Winnick.  A heads up for senior week activities that start April 26 and end on April 30 for those prospective graduates of 2011.  The package for senior week includes everything for the price of $150.  The package can be purchased in Hillwood Commons in room 102.
SGA had their final general meeting of the year yesterday.  As for the fall semester of 2011 it is encouraged that students join more often to the general meetings held in Hillwood Commons.
