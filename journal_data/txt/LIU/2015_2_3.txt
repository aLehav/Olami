Students who have taken classes in the Fine Arts building may be familiar with Professor Gwendolyn Carroll, who is part of the Music Department. Carroll teaches Elementary Musicianship, Musicianship for Music Teachers, and Keyboard Harmony.
Despite her 53 years of teaching, Carroll shows no preference towards what class she enjoys teaching the most. “Frankly I can’t say that I have a favorite class to teach, but I do enjoy working with music student teachers when they student-teach,” Carroll continued. “Also, last semester I taught, for the first time, Elementary Musicianship and had such enjoyment helping those students get their footing to the whole understanding of theoretical practices in music,” Carroll said.
I am blessed to be around the bright minds with visions to better themselves academically and intellectually. I enjoy the camaraderie of the students and the commitment they’ve made to the music department, to their families, and [to] themselves,” Carroll said.
Carroll loves to work with students who are eager to learn and can openly express themselves, are energetic and always responsible for their actions. “I work tirelessly at preparing syllabi that are engaging, interesting and enjoyable,” she continued. “I hope each student leaves my classes with a renewed interest in music and certainly leaves having
much more understanding and knowledge about music and the career they’ve chosen. Many are studying to become music teachers. If they wish to use me as an example, I am in my 53rd year of teaching and I’m not tired yet,” Carroll said.
What is Carroll’s least favorite part about teaching? “By nature and personal make-up, I am often impatient with others when it comes to time management. Some of my least favorite things involve just that, waiting for others to catch up.”
She said that if she could create any class at LIU Post, she would create a course around time management. “How do we deal with the students of the 21st century? And how, given the many variables making it difficult to keep them interested in a classroom setting, can we continue to challenge their minds and interests?” Carroll said.
How do some the students at LIU feel about Professor Carroll?
“She’s very patient and understanding with her students and she makes the learning environment approachable,” said Mariel Bourie, a freshman Music Education major . “So if you don’t understand something, you’re not afraid to ask.” Bourie continued, “She was an amazing professor and I would highly recommend her to other students.”

Street artists have gathered to create a journey through the evolution of graffiti and art at the Steinberg Museum on the second floor of Hillwood Commons. The exhibit features work from more than 35 artists, and different mediums such as photography, graffiti painted directly on the walls and on traditional canvas, as well as digital mediums.
The exhibit, called “Concrete to Data,” will span from Feb. 29 through March 21. Curator, professor Ryan Seslow, has created a museum space reminiscent of the graffiti boom of the ‘80s and ‘90s, and has incorporated new technology to showcase it.
“We’ve gathered artists from five generations here, with the oldest being in their seventies, and youngest at 23,” Seslow said. “It’s the first time anyone has had this kind of street art in a proper museum space.” Seslow, who is an artist and professor in the Art Department and a longtime street artist, has four of his own pieces in the show.
The pieces on show vary in terms of medium. With one wall being covered by the pictures of Henry Chalfant, a photographer who’s known for his documentations on graffiti, breakdance, and hip-hop culture. The piece consists of small cutouts of subway cars from the ‘80s and ‘90s, covered in different motifs. “He’s got over 800 of them, and that wasn’t even all of them!” Seslow said.
The new exhibition incorporates technology in a way that includes the viewer with the artists. “We have a map of where all the artists works’ are shown in the space, but it also includes the various artists’ Instagram-tags, so you can snap a photo of the artist’s piece, tag him, and ask him a question,” Seslow said. “It removes this hierarchy of who’s better, and removes some distance between the audience and artists.” This is contrary to the traditional exhibit space, “where the artist is either dead, or impossible to reach,” he added.
“The subject of both graffiti and street art are being expanded in this show. I am interested in seeing how the works [will] come together on a technical and stylistic front,” Seslow said. “Can the digital works hold up with and compliment the murals? Can the framed photos compliment the three-dimensional works? The viewer plays a big role in how they will experience the works, both physically and digitally. The show has a growing website,” which can be found at concretetodata.com.
Art students from professor Winn Rea’s classes are also involved in this exhibition, where they are learning various molding techniques. They have molded pieces of technology, such as keyboards and cell phones, in concrete. “Afterwards, we’re digging a hole for them, sort of as a time capsule,” Seslow added.
Museum director Barbara Applegate is happy with what she thinks is a brave exhibition. “As a museum director, this project is a risk. Normally, you can look at the pictures up front, and keep it within the usual frames. But here, the artists came in and painted directly on the walls,” she said. “I’m pretty sure at least one [of the artists] didn’t know what to put up there before he saw the space.”
Usually, the museum knows exactly where everything is going, and exactly how it’s going to look, but this time, they had the risk of artists not showing up, and not knowing what they would make, which, for Applegate, was a new experience. Content-wise, Applegate was clueless as to what she would have in her museum the day after the artists were there. Street art is known for its social commentary and edginess, so she took another risk by leaving out the frames and constraints that others might have had.
“There are a few pieces that show the social commentary,” Applegate said. Seslow pointed out one piece, a modified version of the ‘80s cartoon G.I. Joe, where the soldier is coming back from the Vietnam War. A realistic version, where G.I. Joe is met with mental and physical struggle, opposed to the glorifying, pro-war propaganda of the original. The six minute cartoon is available online at www.encryptedfills.com, and is a collaborative project between Seslow and artist RJ Rushmore, who has other pieces in the exhibition.
Despite the risk she’s taking, Applegate is very happy with the result, and has already gotten positive feedback from students and colleagues alike. While the artists were installing and painting, Applegate said people passed by and were obviously hit by what she calls a very dynamic exhibition, full of contrast and different mediums.
The reception will be held on Friday, Feb. 6, at 6 p.m., and is open to the public. For more information about museum hours, visit www.liu.edu/museum.

The winter season is all about sitting near the fireplace, drinking hot chocolate with marshmallows, and watching your favorite movies. It’s the season where everyone wants to stay warm and be around family. LIU Post had its first snow day on Jan. 27, so The Pioneer decided to ask this question: what is your favorite snow day movie?
Surprisingly, a few people like to watch historical movies through which they can learn something. According to Sharon Sextus, a sophomore Marketing major, “Boy in the Striped Pajamas” is her favorite movie for this weather. “It’s about a young boy named Bruno whose father is part of the Nazi army and gets promoted,” Sextus explaimed. “The family then has to move to a new home which is secluded from society. Bruno then finds a ‘camp’ where he meets a Jew- ish boy and becomes his friend although they’re taught to be separated.”
For other students, a snow day is incomplete without a thriller. Zaroon Ahsan Butt, a senior Finance and Marketing major, picked “Gone Girl” as a good movie to watch on a snowy day. “Gone Girl” is about a man named Nick who comes home to find out that his wife Amy has gone missing. Later, [the] media accuses Nick for murdering his wife, but the truth is that his [Amy] had plotted against h[im]. It has a lot of suspense, so it keeps the audience connected,” Ahsan Butt explained.
On the other hand, Shyheim Walters, a sophomore Accounting major, says his favorite movie is “Taken 3.” “This movie is about an ex-government operative named Bryan Mills whose ex-wife is murdered.
He is accused of the murder, and uses his skills to find out who the real murderer is so he can clea[r] his name from this case; [he] also tries to protect his daughter who means the world to him,” Walters said.
Comedy films are known to be attention-grabbers and a favorite movie genre to watch with the whole family. Many holiday movies such as, “Elf”, “The Santa Clause” series, “The Holiday” and “The Family Man” are all comedy films. Like many of us, Jaggernath Boodram, freshman Computer Engineer major, believes “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” is by far the best movie to watch when it’s cold outside.
“This movie is actually the second movie of the series, and it is about a young boy named Kevin McCallister. [He] accidentally gets on [a] plane to New York where on the other side his family was taking the route to Florida for Christmas,” Boodram explained. “There he finds Harry and Marv, the same robbers from the first movie, but he finds out that they have escaped prison and now call themselves [the] ‘Sticky Bandits’. So he sets traps and tries to get them arrested.”
Snowy days are kinds that often evoke childhood memories. Being stuck inside, we often rely on movies for needed entertainment. From historical to comedy, every genre is someone’s favorite. Some prefer to watch romantic movies while others enjoy getting goose bumps from horror films. These movies grab our attention, and take us away from the real world until all the snow has melted away.

On Thursday, Jan. 29, the women’s basketball team (11-8) played host to the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) Firebirds (16-3). The East Coast Conference battle was a tale of two halves for the Pioneers, as their shortcomings in the first half proved too much to overcome in the end, losing 82-73.
The Firebirds came out with a lot of energy from the opening tip, which helped spark a 16-6 run by the visitors early on. The Firebirds kept their energy levels high, upped the tempo, and pushed their lead to 26-6 within the first ten minutes of the contest. The visitors played a consistent first half, playing suffocating defense along with getting out in transition and getting easy baskets. The Pioneers trailed 45-29 at the break.
As the second half rolled on, it was more of the same from the Pioneers. Lackluster defense and careless control of the basketball lead to a Firebird 20 point advantage on the scoreboard. With just under seven minutes remaining, the Green and Gold brought their intensity up and tightened up on the defensive end. The home side pressure led to a 19-5 run and brought them to a six points reach. With the score at 79-73 in favor of the Firebirds, it became a game of free throws down the stretch. The Firebirds nailed their shots from the charity stripe and earned the victory.
In the loss, junior center Nyasia Davis earned her third double-double of the season. She dropped 20 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. Senior guard Chelsea Williams added 18 points and nine boards to her stat line, while senior guard Ashley Castle added 12 points, six assists, and three steals. For the Firebirds, junior guard Tajruba Baldwin-Kollore netted 17 points along with four assists. Fellow junior guard Shantrel Oliver added 14 points, five assists, and was perfect from the free-throw line.
As a team, the Pioneers were dominant down low, outscoring their opponents by 12 in the paint and hustling for loose balls to get second chance opportunities. Perhaps more significant, the Firebirds severely outscored LIU in points off turnovers, resulting in easier baskets and ultimately the win.
Head Coach Deirdre Moore and the Pioneers will look to bounce back today when the University of Bridgeport comes to Brookville, N.Y. for an ECC battle. The opening tip is slated for 5 p.m. from the Pratt Recreation Center.

The 2015 East Coast Conference indoor track and field Coaches’ Poll was released on Wednesday, Jan. 28, and both
the men’s and the women’s team each ranked sixth. Only a couple of days later, Pat Slevin was officially announced Head Coach of the teams, including Cross Country.
With a masters degree in Secondary Education from Adelphi University, and more than 20 years of prior coaching experience, Slevin will continue to build upon the newly expanded running branch with the Pioneers.
Coach Slevin comes right off a ninth place mark in the Division I MAAC Championships as Head Coach for Manhattan College’s cross country teams, and Assistant to the track an field teams.
So far in their 2014-15 season, Slevin and his Pioneer squad have challenged in five indoor meets, the latest sequel competing with three runners at the Armory Invitational on Friday through Saturday, Jan. 30-31.
The Pioneers got a refreshing start to the early morning meet as junior Elizabeth Stirling broke a school record on the women’s 3K with a time of 10:31.69, which placed her second in her heat. In the men’s ditto, red-shirt senior Mike Scott snatched a third place, finishing at 8:41.37.
Last season’s men’s soccer team member Dale McDonald proved that he can run even without the ball clustered to his feet, as he fired away from the 200-meter dash and completed his race at a time of 23.11.
Head Coach Pat Slevin and the Pioneers are back in action for the Ramapo College Indoor Select on Saturday, Feb. 7, in the New Balance Track and Field Center at the Armory, N.Y. The teams are set to start racing at 5 p.m.

On Thursday, the men’s basketball team used an early scoring tear to cruise to a 74-61 win against University of the District of Columbia (UDC) in an East Coast Conference clash at the Pratt Recreation Center.
The Pioneers (10-9) jumped out to a 13-2 lead, led by red-shirt freshman guard Aary Bibens who collected nine points on the opening run of the contest.
LIU Post dominated the entire first half as they shot 52.0 percent (13-of-25) from the floor and garbed an alarming 36-22-cushion heading into the locker room.
Although UDC (4-15) got out to a hot start in the second half, the Pioneers were able to absorb the run once the Firebirds reduced the deficit to 10 points 1:24 in. The Green and Gold responded with a 14-2 uproar in a 3:40 span to pull away with a 52-30 advantage. Five different Pioneers scored during the streak. Junior guard Dillon Burns tallied up four points, three of which came on a transition trey, while senior guard P.J. Torres dropped in a lay-up on the fast break.
Senior forward Tyuan Williams led all scorers for the fourth-consecutive contest, racking up 15 points on 6-of-12 from the field. Williams hauled in seven boards and recorded two assists. Torres made a great contribution off the bench scoring 13 points and eight rebounds. Bibens added 13 points, as well. Sophomore forward Greg Dotson had eight points, six boards and two blocks for the hosts.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers return to work on Wednesday, Feb.4, when they continue their four-game home stand against Bridgeport at the Pratt Recreation Center. The Pioneers will look to even up their conference record at 6-6. Opening tip is set for 7.30 p.m.
