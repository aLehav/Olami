On September 21st, when students opened their MyLIU emails, they might have found an email that’s subject title didn’t fit in with the rest.  The subject title was “Race and Ethnic Background.”  The response many people had was, “What?”  Some students didn’t even open it to see what the contained. A few who opened it and read it didn’t bother taking the survey.  Some decided to take the survey.  They were disappointed at what they thought was the first page.  The first question was “Do you consider yourself to be Hispanic/Latino?” The answer choices were “Yes or No”.    The next question was, “In addition, please select one or more of the following racial categories to describe yourself,” and the options were as follows: “American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or White.”  After you chose from the options, you received a message saying that the survey was complete.
According to Rita Langdon for the school’s Office of Public Relations, “The University emailed a short two-question demographic survey to all LIU undergraduate and graduate students.”  The survey was very narrow, and a few people who I spoke to were very turned off by this.  Why?  Because they are multiracial; they don’t ascribe to one race or another. They consider themselves as both.  So, what were they supposed to click on? “Other” was not an option. A friend of mine, Sheila Abreu-Nuñes, a health care major, took the survey.  She said yes to the first question, and when she got to the second, she looked at me and said, “What do I do? I’m not any of these. I’m Hispanic; that’s it.” The U.S. Census Bureau does not regard Hispanic as a race, but, rather, as an ethnic group.  This definition goes against the grain of everyday people who define Hispanic as a race.  Many people who consider themselves Hispanic have to the define themselves as non-white Hispanic or white Hispanic.
The 1990 census was not as long as the current one.  Although, the census survey had the same races listed in the C.W. Post student survey, it included the option of  “other,” and many people who were of a Hispanic or Latino background selected that option and wrote Hispanic or Latino.   American culture has always tried to break things down by race; therefore, people like Abreu-Nunesmy are forced to define themselves by another person’s standards.
After Abreu-Nunesshe realized that the only questions where those two, she was not happy. “What’s the point of this anyway? Didn’t I do this already when I applied?” The answer to her question is yes. When you filled out your application, you did have to enter your race/ethnicity.  So, the school does have it on file, and one can go on collegeboard.com or any other college website and find the breakdown of student demographics. One could say, though, that those breakdowns are not completely accurate.  For instance, according to collegeboard.com, 3% of C.W. Post’s student body is Asian. When I told Ashley Staib, a music education major, she was shocked by that statistic.  Yet, C.W. Post does have a lot of foreign exchange students, more than some schools on Long Island.  Maybe, they aren’t accurately being represented.  Most likely, the University didn’t get an accurate picture of the student body from the recent survey either, but according to Rita Langdon for the Office or Public Relations, “The University emailed a short two-question demographic survey to all LIU undergraduate and graduate students.” Howver, as stated above, many some students didn’t bother even opening the email.  Others, like Ashley Staib, didn’t take it because there was not a viable option for her to click on for question number two.
Most likely, the University didn’t get an accurate picture of the student body. When the Pioneer contacted Mr. Claude Cheek, the University’s  Associate Vice President and Director of the Office of Institutional Research, he didn’t comment on what the goal of the survey was, why it was given or how successful it was.  Instead, Rita Langdon replied for him that the reason for the survey was because “Long Island University is asked by many governmental and other outside agencies to provide statistics on the racial and ethnic background of students and employees.  For decades, the University has collected data related to the ethnicity of students, faculty and staff to meet federal and other governmental requirements. The Federal Higher Education Act revised the form of the questions regarding race and ethnicity.” This was the administration’s way of complying with that request.  The Pioneer could not obtain an answer as to how successful the survey was or if there could have been a more accurate and efficient way of getting the data the University needed.
We can only wonder and assume how successful the survey was, and one could speculate that it was not very successful.   Many students didn’t know about it at all because a fair percentage of our student body doesn’t use their MyLIU email because of how many times there are problems relating to the email system.  Others didn’t take it, expecting it to be long.  Still, others didn’t take it because the answers were unacceptable to them.

Are you looking for a fun and exciting way to earn credits toward your degree? If so, a study abroad program could be the answer. On Wednesday, September 28th, during common hour in Hillwood Commons, the Study Abroad Office hosted its annual Study Abroad Fair. Different programs were there to provide information about different places to study.
Some of the organizations in attendance included GlobalLinks Learning Abroad, AIFS, CIS Abroad, and API.  Long Island University also had a table set up with information about programs students can take through their own international studies programs and contact information for students to get more information such as, visa applications, costs of programs, and credits students can receive. Will Romero, a senior political science major, enjoyed the fair saying, “Every table had something different to offer. I liked the variety and options and the information they provided. They answered any questions one might have.”
These exhibitors offer students the opportunity to take classes, which work with most majors, in countries such as England, Ireland, Greece, Spain, China, Japan, Australia, and Costa Rica. Students have the option of studying abroad for the spring or fall semesters, the winter session, summer session, or for an entire year. Costs of programs and the amount of credits available that may be earned vary by program. Students must be in good academic standing and can start programs anytime from the beginning of sophomore year to the first semester of senior year. For more information about specific programs, contact the Study Abroad Office at 516-299-2508.

With every new school year comes a new and exciting lineup of shows at C.W. Post’s own Tilles Center. This year is no exception. With big names, like Idina Menzel and Marilyn Maye, and such renowned broadway plays, such as Fiddler on the Roof and In the Heights, the 2011-2012 season has something for everyone.
What makes it even better is just how accessible these shows are to students. Not only is the theater right on campus, but students can also buy tickets for just $12 apiece when they present their student identifications at the box office.
This discounted price is not new to Post, however many students might overlook this opportunity. Emily Edwards, a senior theater major, feels that the Tilles Center is a great asset to the community at C.W. Post.  She said, “The student discount inspires me to see more productions,” which is certainly something students are encouraged to use to their advantage.  The Tilles Center also provides students with a multitude of different performances and events to choose from.  There are also certain performances that offer something called Performance Plus! This event is offered for several of the performances scheduled to take place this year. Performance Plus! events cost five dollars and are presented before the main performance happening that night. They often include lectures or discussions by professors of C.W. Post or individuals directly connected to the performance. They give audience members insight into productions, artistic concepts, and what it is like to be a performer on the stage.
Tilles Center box-office hours are 1 p.m. to 6 p.m.,  from Monday through Saturday. For more information about tickets, seating, and upcoming performances, visit www.tillescenter.org.
 
Here are the upcoming October performances worth looking into:
 10/2 – The Nassau Pops Symphony Orchestra: Live from Las Vegas
10/8 – Thanos Petrelis and So Tiri
10/9 – Ariel Quartet
10/14 – Tedeschi Trucks Band Revelator Tour 2011
10/15 – The Flying Karamazov Brothers
10/16 – State Symphony Capella of Russia, Direct from Moscow
10/21 – Debby Boone in Reflections of Rosemary
10/22 – Tosca
10/28 – Brian Stokes Mitchell
10/29 – Ruben Blades
10/30 – In the Heights

This past week started the series of 12 student success workshops that will be spread out over the course of this semester.  The Academic and Career Planning dept and the Cooperative Education & Internships are sponsoring this series. These series of twelve different workshops can help students with almost anything they are looking for. They vary from time management, reading strategies, helping you build a resume and financial help.
This program was on Effective Studying Strategies and took place on Wednesday September 28th and like the rest of the workshops it takes place during common hour. Erin G., a freshman and an education major said “I honestly had no method to study and it was hard making this switch from high school to college and I was overwhelmed, but this program gave me a lot of ideas to help me study.”
At first they asked all the students what kind of study techniques they used that worked for them. It was able to show the rest of the students what other kind of methods students can use to study and maybe take some ideas from them and incorporate it into their own study routine.
Some other topics that were covered were being organized and picking a good place to study that will benefit some students the most.   Another topic was asking for help. Sometimes professors explain a topic that you may not understand and asking for help is a vital option. Students can always talk to other students or directly with their professors. Also speak with academic advisors, because they can help students with certain issues.
The academic advisors stay after the program is over to answer any questions or concerns that you might have. Visit the departments of your major and get more information if any help is needed. The next Student Success workshop will be on October 5th during common hour in Humanities 119 on effective test taking strategies.

Dear Editors,
 
We are proud of the job you have been doing so far this semester in fairly and accurately reporting the news for our campus community.  At the same time, we are distressed that you have encountered so many obstacles in obtaining information from the campus administration.  We know how frustrating the process of obtaining information of concern to students has been for many of your reporters, and can only say that their perseverance and determination will pay off for them in their future careers as journalists.
We were especially disturbed when you were told this week that you could not run lawfully obtained, accurate information from a reliable source with a responsible position in the campus administration because he was not authorized by the Public Relations office to speak with you.  The campus administration should realize that it is inappropriate to interfere with the  First Amendment rights of student journalists.  Where better for students to learn about the rights they have as Americans than on a college campus?  We hope that in the future, the individuals who tried to persuade you to withhold your story will remember those rights, and realize that your job is to gather and report the news and that a student newspaper is still a legitimate newspaper. In our view, your paper reflects how well you are doing your job of providing an important source of campus information to all our students.
Sincerely,
Professors Barbara Fowles and Carolyn Levin

            The Student Government Association held its weekly general meeting on Tuesday, September 27th, at the Top of Hillwood Commons.  During the meeting, new concerns and important announcements were presented.
This year’s SGA Executive Board includes President Jared Ciborowski, Vice President Gina Oseguedo, Executive Officer Kristy Niemeyer, Treasurer Deborah Khalou, Secretary Ariel Carner and Parliamentarian Quani Gore.  The chairperson and members of the each committee were also present, including the academic, food, diversity, and campus quality and security committees.  A representative for each student club was there as well.
Several announcements were given during the meeting, including activities that will take place in the following dates.  Freddie Schwartz will hold her third general meeting of the Black Cat Book Club on Thursday, during common hour in the Hillwood Commons study lounge.   All clubs are required to attend the Leadership Development Series Workshops.  The second program is the Career Planning Workshop, which will be held on Thursday, October 13th, in the Pioneer Room, in Hillwood Commons at 7 p.m.  All students in attendance during the series of workshops will have a chance to win in a raffle, and light refreshments will be served.

The Kitty Foremans, Marion Cunninghams, and June Cleavers of 20th century television have created an image of the perfect housewife and mother. Another way of looking at it is that these fictional women have raised the bar, making it impossible for females today to even compete. It seems that guys have the notion that taking care of them should be the number one priority. Being a 20-year-old girl, I don’t agree.
Now, I don’t have a boyfriend to take care of currently, but I did for four years. I’m all too familiar with, “Babe, I’m thirsty; baby, I’m hungry; sweetie, can you get something for me?”  In my head all I’m thinking is,” Oh, you’re thirsty? Well guess what…so am I!” In most cases, if I want something, I get up and get it myself. Unless my significant other is already up, then I’ll ask. Now I don’t want to come of as cold or frigid. Of course there were plenty of instances over the course of my four-year relationship that I would haul my lazy butt off the couch and get whatever it was that my boyfriend wanted.
It’s the bigger picture I find a problem with. I’ve asked my guy friends what they expect of their future wives and there was one answer that the majority of them came up with. They want a stay-at-home wife who will cook, clean, and take care of them and the kids, if they have any. I tried explaining to them that that is a primitive idea and quite unrealistic. But no, no, they’re going to make plenty of money because that’s what they’re supposed to do as the breadwinners. They’re going to come home from work and expect dinner ready, kick their shoes off, open a beer, and watch TV. Sounds like an episode of That 70’s Show, doesn’t it?
All the while, I’m sitting there thinking,” Yeah right,” for more than one reason. First off there’s no way on this Earth that I’ll ever be amenable to that, it’s just not the way I’m wired. I’m all for the, give a little to get a little, principle. Second, in this day and state of economy, it takes two separate incomes to raise a family and live comfortably. If that’s the situation you find yourself in when it’s time to get married, the rest of the work like cleaning, food shopping, cooking, and taking care of the kids should be divided up. It’s not reasonable to think that after working all day, your wife is going to come home and truly want to do everything for you.
Now boys, I know the idea of doing any sort of manual labor is terrifying, but you’re going to have to help, especially when it comes to the heavy lifting. Women are natural caretakers so, if you take the initiative to do something without us asking, we will love it. We will also probably not ask you to do anything else for the rest of the day or the few days preceding. Thinking a little bit preemptively and just helping us out every once and a while may end up benefitting you in the long run.
The bottom line here is, no, I will not be your 1950’s housewife. I will be inclined to take care of you sometimes due to my genetic makeup. However, I will also expect some help. Women haven’t been creeping their way up the corporate ladder just to come home and take a step back in time.

There is no better way to energize a fall outfit than with some well-thought out accessories. For those of us who may find it daunting to follow clothing trends, incorporating accessories is an easier way to be trendy while maintaining your own singular style and aesthetic. These are just a few examples that you can incorporate into your own style.
A printed scarf is a versatile option that is totally customizable. Scarves are available in many variations such as floral, animal print, and more. Blending any scarf with a simple top and pair of jeans provides a dose of personality and warmth. It also is the perfect way to diversify your outfits and reinvigorate your wardrobe. Scarves can be found anywhere you choose to shop. The options are endless. “I think scarves are style essentials that also keep your neck warm!” says Junior Political Science major Nicole Duckham.
Statement necklaces are very popular this season. A statement necklace is any larger necklace with lots of adornments, colors, and/or details. These have been popping up all over the runway and on celebrities, and this trend is now making it’s way to the mainstream. Spend a few moments in Forever 21, combing through their seemingly endless jewelry section, and you’ll definitely see what I mean. Introducing a spiked choker such as one from Forever 21 ($8.80) is a great way to bring an outfit from day to night for those special occasions. “Statement jewelry really makes you stand out,” said Dorianna Valerio, a junior journalism major “A pop of color or texture goes a long way, so an elaborate necklace really makes an outfit unique.”
We can all thank celebrity stylist and now reality-television personality, Rachel Zoe, for our next fall trend — faux fur vests. When used badly, faux-fur vests can seem both a little cheesy and a little dated. However, if you pair a faux fur vest with a breezy blouse and a pair of trousers, as Zoe frequently does, you will look completely fashion forward. Not only will this trend keep you warm, but it will also provide a more interesting and unique option, as opposed to a typical sweater, blazer, or cardigan.
After much research it has come to my attention that the “it” bag of the season is the satchel bag. Move over Alan from “The Hangover” and his personal style icon, “Indiana Jones”, because the satchel bag has been reinvented for our personal gain. Try a Cambridge Satchel Company handbag (around $118), or one from Old Navy ($20) in order to bring a trend bag into your life.
Look for pieces and accessories that combine functionality and style to make your fall wardrobe come alive. Although trend following may seem difficult or intimidating, the point is to have fun and experiment with new and exciting trends to figure out what works for you.

No, this is not Harry Potter’s world; we can’t just push a button and fly the car. If only we could. Yet there are ways to get to school faster, and by that I don’t mean speeding, because during traffic, it’s impossible to speed unless you make your own lane. But whether you’re coming from the east, west, north or south, the specific route you take is the one that could get you to class on time, and we all know how important that is.
I’ll talk about my route first, since it’s the one I know best. I have avoided parkways at all costs for the past four years. I take side streets. I go to Old Country Road to Glen Cove Road and then take that down to Northern Boulevard.  Eight out of ten times Glen Cove Road and Northern Boulevard are free from traffic. For those coming from out on the Island such as Wading River, Ronkonkoma, Brentwood, Central Islip, and Lindenhurst, the best route would be to go on the Long Island Expressway. I prefer the L.I.E. to the Northern State, since you can take the Northern State to the 135 then to the L.I.E (it’s complicated). The L.I.E. is the only parkway that will get you to Glen Cove Road and then to Northern Boulevard.
Westchester is a fantastic area I’m not at all familiar with, but I do know you need to take a bridge, the Throgs Neck to be exact. Those who have to travel from Westchester should have an EZ-Pass, so you don’t need to wait in line. After the Throgs Neck, you’ll take the Clearview Expressway to I-495, otherwise known as the L.I.E. There really aren’t other ways to get to school from Westchester, unless you have a boat! From Queens, you can just take the L.I.E. and follow that down to Glen Cove Road. I like to get to the L.I.E. from the Cross Island Parkway or the Belt, which eventually turns into the Cross Island. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway always has traffic or roadwork going on, which makes the commute slower. The Cross Island, while slow in the morning, is a faster commute.
These are just a few routes. I know the I-495 is basically the route to take, but I find the L.I.E. is very commuter friendly. While it is a dangerous road, it has the most lanes and a HOV lane, which allows you to travel faster if you carpool. And carpooling is an excellent way to keep it eco-friendly and an even faster route. Whatever route you may take, or whatever route you feel the most comfortable with, always drive safely and set a timed schedule, just in case you hit that pesky traffic.

Cookies and cream, caramel apple, cotton candy, peanut butter cup, toasted coconut, cappuccino, raspberry swirl, cookie dough, brownie, s’mores, devil’s food cake, and milkshake…..did that get your attention? Nope, we’re not talking about ice cream! These are only some of the many cupcake flavors that the newly opened bakeshop, Crumbs, has to offer.
Located at 5 Glen Cove Road, Greenvale, across the street from Dunkin’ Donuts, it’s the perfect place for a treat after a hard day of classes. Crumbs just opened on Friday, September 23rd and business already seems to be booming! When you walk in, it’s almost like walking into a small-town bakery in Italy. The walls match perfectly with their to-die-for red velvet cupcakes. With this homey environment, a giant quote spreads across the wall saying, “made by hand, baked with love.” Before you get too excited over cupcakes, they’re not the only things this bakeshop offers. The assortment ranges from various baked goods like birthday cakes, boxed mini cupcakes, Hamantashen pastries, every type of cookie imaginable, muffins, scones, mini bobkas, and a large selection of iced and hot coffees, lattes, teas, and homemade lemonade.
Crumbs also offers a large number of promotions. Attributable to their grand opening, for the next week a free cup of coffee is offered to you with your purchase. This past Saturday they also had a promotion starting at seven in the morning, during which they gave away a free cupcake to the first 1,000 customers. They also provide you with a “cupcake of the week” This past week, it was a mudslide cupcake. Yum! However, should you be concerned at all with how much you indulge, they also have the calorie count underneath each and every cupcake. But everything in moderation is okay! With each cupcake ranging from $2.50-$4.00, don’t be afraid to come on down and treat yourself to something sweet. After all, one of Crumbs’ slogans is “You can taste the happiness.” For more information on Crumbs, you can contact them at info@crumbs.com

Three weeks into the academic calendar, and C.W. Post’s B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library is once again seeing familiar numbers filter through its doors.
“From 10 a.m. until closing, there is constant foot traffic in and out of the library,” says Martha Cooney, the assistant dean for user services.
This comes as no surprise, as, in 2003, a full-on renovation equipped the library with a myriad of contemporary functions that students have come to rely on. Gone are the days when all that a campus library had to offer were several million volumes of text, a square mile of microform storage, and a helpful staff (though they still have these things).
Available on the library’s website are dozens of online databases, which give students access to accredited information around the clock.
Online alone, there are 1.2 million volumes, with remote access to 25,000 e-books, and over 200 library databases (Library Pamphlet). Services such as ebrary, a database with thousands of books in digital format, allow a user to create an electronic bookshelf full of downloadable text.
The B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library houses 2,615,194 volumes of text and is involved in an Interlibrary Loan Service (ILLiad), which allows students to access the full catalogs of most major libraries around the country.
The library also has a sizable collection of prints, microform and periodicals, which have, for the most part, become digitized, and are available for download. Items from the database that are not available online can also be obtained through the ILLiad service.
Over the past two decades, the library’s integration with technology has completely changed the way students access information.
“The Library has changed, but in a wonderful way,” says Cooney. “The content we can provide to students is so much better than it was 20 years ago. The library has no boundaries.”
Since the renovation, the library is now home to 24 computer workstations, network and wireless connections, a quiet study room, an instructional room, a copy center, a circulation desk, a help desk, stacks with private carrels, and many additional study tables.
In addition to the libraries new features, new initiatives have been established to help students acclimate to more modern methods of research.
One such initiative, titled “Ways to Ask A Librarian for Help,” described on informational, details five ways to contact the library’s staff:
IM A Librarian: A service that involves using one of five instant messaging services to chat with reference librarians on duty.
Chat: A dedicated chat platform, accessible through the library’s website.
Research by Appointment: a private consultation with a reference librarian. Reference librarians are also available by email and by telephone.
Inquiries include navigating the Library’s catalog, developing topics for a research paper, and identifying appropriate Internet resources.
The use of online resources by students has been overwhelming; with the library’s online databases receiving thousands of hits so far this year.
Caitlyn Wrigley, a graduate student in library sciences, feels that the library and its staff are invaluable resources for students. “The library’s many digital resources are exceptional, and the librarians are always there to help,” said Wrigley. “It’s something that everyone should take advantage of because they have everything you could possibly need to succeed as a student.”
Though the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library has undergone an aesthetic transformation in recent years, still unchanged is the staff of librarians, who are relentless in their pursuit to provide students with a wealth of relevant information.

     According to tattooartist.com, tattoos have become a popular cultural phenomenon in the past fifteen years, as well as a thriving business. Tattoo parlors have popped up everywhere recently, and young adults have created tattoo portfolios that come equipped with unique designs.
Shows like ‘LA Ink’ have redefined the tattoo. Tattoos aren’t just a permanent mark on your body; they are a mark of who you are as a person. Each tattoo represents something special to that person, and many of them come with some great stories. While tattoos maybe appealing, they come with a few negatives, such as the effect they may have on getting a job.
According to the New York Times, some bosses have not hired people with visible tattoos because they leave an impression that the potential employees have been in jail, or are members of a gang. Other bosses think that customers, or other employees, will be afraid of the potential employees because of the tattoos.
At C.W. Post, there are hundreds of students with tattoos for various reasons, but are they afraid of not getting a job because of them?
“I have a total of three tattoos, each one representing a significant event that has changed my life in a positive way,” said Dave Levine, nutrition major and employee of C.W. Post,. “When I look at my tattoos, they are a continuous reminder to always keep moving forward and to take each day with an open mind. As for future job prospects and having tattoos go, I’m personally not worried about potentially being rejected because I have them. In today’s world, tattoos are becoming more and more acceptable and common in the workplace. I would prefer not to hide something that I am proud of, and if they ask me to cover them up, then I’m not interested in being part of something that shallow.”
Kathleen Faust, sophomore undecided says, “I have four tattoos, none of them that are noticeable. Two are on my back, one is on my ribs and then there’s one on my upper thigh, so I don’t have the problem, but I do think people should think into tattoos before getting one. I am currently having a tattoo lasered off slowly. It sucks, so my word of advice is never get a tattoo that you’ll regret.”
As an owner of three tattoos myself, I wasn’t even thinking of a job when I got them. The tattoos are located on my bicep, back, and my ankle. None of them are really visible except for my ankle, which can be covered up with pants if needed. A tip from the Internet suggested covering up the tattoos with make-up, but why do that everyday? Show your tattoos proudly; they make you who you are.

On September 30th, Provost Paul Forestell issued a memo via e-mail reminding students, faculty and staff members about Post’s non-smoking policy. The policy prohibits the use and carrying of any smoking paraphernalia inside any building on campus. However, the policy has prompted a very valid question; should smoking on campus be banned?
Assistant Provost, Amy Urquhart said, via e-mail, “The campus smoking policy is in compliance with the Nassau County Ordinance. All of our buildings are smoke-free, according to law, which states smoking inside in public, or at any workplace, is prohibited.”
Senior History major, Ashley Ingleton, thinks smoking on campus should be banned, “I think that would be a good idea because the smoking on campus has really got out of hand. It is a nightmare for people like me who have a history of asthma, to have to deal with clouds of smoke on this campus.”
However, Junior Broadcasting major, Stephanie J., doesn’t mind the smoking on campus. She said “If I lived on campus, I would say smoking should be permitted in smoking areas. However since I don’t live on campus, it does not matter to me because I can do it off campus.”
One compromise for the members of Post who smoke, and those who don’t, would be to have specific “smoke areas” on campus. However, Urquhart said, “C.W. Post does not maintain any exterior areas designated as smoke areas.” Ingleton doesn’t agree with having any designated smoke areas on campus, “It will not solve the overall issue of the smoking problem on campus. Designated areas would just be a “short cut” solution to the problem.” However, Stephanie thinks there should be smoke areas on campus, “Those who do not smoke won’t be exposed, and those who do, will be happy.”
According to No-smoke.org, created by the organization ‘Americans for non-smokers’ rights,’ which is the leading national lobbying organization dedicated to non-smokers’ rights as of July 1, 2011, there were over five hundred completely smoke-free college campuses nationwide. A search of the partial list of campuses that have enacted the smoke-free policy, revealed that the State of New York has at least 33 campuses that have done so.
While C.W. Post isn’t a smoke-free campus, and is not on the list, the non-smoking policy in buildings at Post is beneficial. The policy protects Post members who don’t smoke, without completely stripping them of their right to smoke if they want to. Even though many of us can agree that smoking is an environmental and health hazard, deciding to smoke or not is an individual choice we all have to respect, and for now, Post allows us to make that choice for ourselves.

“Crumbs”
5 Glen Cove Road
Greenvale, N.Y.
Crumbs offers an extensive variety of perfectly-made, delectable cupcakes. They are not your ordinary cupcakes either – they are larger and tastier than any cupcake you’ve ever had. With flavors ranging from chocolate-covered strawberry, to red velvet, to caramel apple and toasted coconut, the worst part of your Crumbs experience will be having to choose just one! (Although, if you don’t mind the 300-500 calories per cupcake, you can have more!)
Lucky for us Post students, a new bakery just opened up on Glen Cove Road, right in the Moe’s parking lot. Not only are they offering their scrumptious cupcakes, but you get a free hot or iced coffee with your purchase as well (Only for a limited time, I assume). Unfortunately, there are no tables for guests to sit at and enjoy their cupcakes, neither in the store nor outside. Hopefully, that is just because the store is new.
The cupcake of the week when I went was “milkshake,” and it was a delicious mix of moist marble cake and rich chocolate and vanilla icing with chocolate sprinkles on top. If you’re a chocolate lover, like me, I would definitely go for it! Crumbs offers different flavors seasonally, and you can be sure to find a flavor that suits you every time you go! They offer packages of mini-cupcakes that make a great gift as well as extra-large cupcakes that even make a great birthday cake. Of course, they offer a wide range of cookies as well, but I would definitely suggest the cupcakes.

J. Cole. J. Cole. “J Motha Lovin’ Cole.” This dude is something else.
For those of you who don’t know who J. Cole is, he is Jay-Z’s prodigy artist, who signed to Roc-Nation back in 2009. He got a lot of recognition from his first two mix tapes “The Warm up” and “The Come Up,” which were classics, but his fan base really spiked after his third mix tape entitled, “Friday Night Lights”. Since then, people have been waiting for his debut album,”Cole World: The Sideline Story,” which was released in stores and on iTunes on September 27th.
Some compared J. Cole to Nas; some said he was like a gangster- version of Drake. Either way, the dude definitely has lyrics that make you want to rewind, and he is definitely one of the few real hip-hop artists we have left.
I’d say his highly anticipated album is pretty damn good. He gave us exactly what you would expect from a rap artist of his caliber. The album has a whole had tracks you can dance to, songs that make you think, and, also, tracks that just drip hip-hop.
However, it’s not perfect, and it didn’t meet all of my expectations. It was hyped up so much that I thought it was going to be a classic first album, like “iLLmatic”, “Ready To Die” or “Enter The 36 Chambers”.
Sadly, it didn’t live up to the hype. I mean, he delivered good music but nothing really different from what we’ve been hearing before his album dropped. I expected him to turn it up and go all out on his first album, but it didn’t really sound like he did. Also, I’m not a huge fan of him singing his own hooks across half of the album, but despite what I don’t like, I say listen for yourself; it’s definitely worth buying, and I give it an 8/10.

“Come fly with me; let’s fly, let’s fly away.” Pan Am, which was one of the world’s largest airlines, welcomes viewers to fly away to 1963 and join its crew as they travel across the world during the jet age.
Kate Cameron (Kelli Garner), who ditched the ordinary life and escaped the shadows of her younger sister to see the world, has been tapped by the CIA to become an international agent during the height on the Cold War. Who would suspect a beautiful airline stewardess whose job it is to travel the world? The Clipper Majestic embarks on its first flight with Captain Dean Lowrey (Mike Vogel), a new pilot, and First Officer and Co-Pilot Ted Vanderway (Michael Mosley), a former Navy test pilot. Laura Cameron (Margot Robbie) abandoned her wedding to follow in her sister’s footsteps. Colette (Karine Vanasse) has a great understanding of international affairs, both newsworthy and sexually. Maggie Ryan (Christina Ricci) has climbed her way up to a better life.
First and foremost, the CGI (computer-generated imagery) is spectacular. Its visual appeal really transports you back to the 1960’s. You really get nostalgic when events, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion, are front and center. Within minutes, Kate is given her first espionage assignment. No time is wasted getting to the root of the episode. The characters have very little interaction time together as a group. They each have their own problems and tasks that are fulfilled by themselves with some help or encouragement from another. Each crew member has obstacles to tackle. It will certainly be a journey to see how they overcome them. Adventure calls, as Pan Am takes off with an A.

Finally, a great ice cream spot is within just a few miles of campus: D’Lites.  Located on Glen Cove Road in Greenvale, D’lites serves a variety of rotating flavors, including the traditional chocolate and vanilla, as well as their unique flavors such as cinnamon crumb cake, chocolate sno-ball, peanut brittle and, my personal favorite, rice pudding.  For those who have made the switch to frozen yogurt, do not be fooled by the term “ice cream,” as D’lites products are low in sugar, carbs, sodium, fat, and calories and are also gluten free and kosher.  On their website, they explain how it is not considered yogurt because their products contain “no live cultures,” and they use skim milk.  Although it is still ice cream, you won’t feel as guilty as you would from having an ice cream cone elsewhere.  The first time I tried D’lites, I was hooked!   What strikes me the most is how you don’t get the bloated feeling that you sometimes get after eating regular ice cream.  The atmosphere in D’lites also adds to the experience, with its modern décor and ambience.  They offer several toppings to add to your choice of flavor, as well as shakes, sundaes, and ice cream sandwiches.  They are also giving a 15% discount for students at C.W. Post.  Whether you are looking for a place to meet up with friends during common hour or simply craving ice cream, this is the perfect spot to go.  Dlite’s is open Monday through Thursday from noon-10 p.m., Friday and Saturday noon-11 p.m., and Sunday noon-9 p.m.

            Steven Laurino tossed four touchdown passes this past Saturday, two of which landed in the hands of his older brother Grayson Laurino. The pair of brothers starred in the Pioneers 34-23 victory over the West Chester University Rams, Grayson catching the two touchdown passes and totaling 50 receiving yards, and Steven passing 14 of 19 for 162 yards.
The Rams waited no time before they scored their first points of the day, scoring on the first play of the game from scrimmage on a 75 yard pass from West Chester quarterback Sean McCartney to wide out Tim Keyser.  The Pioneers tied the score up later in the quarter after Steven found brother Grayson for their first of two touchdowns.
West Chester took back the lead on a 39 yard field goal from Shawn Leo, and increased the lead to 13-6 on their next drive on another Leo field goal. The Pioneers took the lead before halftime on Anthony Brunetti‘s rushing touchdown, and the Pioneers were ahead 14-13 by the end of the half.
In the third, both offenses went off, combining to score a total of 30 points. The Pioneers scored first, the second of the two touchdowns between Laurino’s. After that touchdown, they never relinquished the lead, although the Rams scored right back to cut the lead to just 23-20.
Jeff Mack, the star of last week’s victory, rushed for 126 yards this week including a touchdown in the third with 3:15 remaining. Before the Rams offense could retaliate, defensive back Evan Flowers intercepted the first play from scrimmage, giving the ball back to C.W. Post. Mack got the Pioneers closer to the end zone rushing for a 35 yard gain and then Laurino connected with Sean Persch in the end zone and the extra point was good to give the Pioneers a 34-20 lead.
In the fourth, both teams tossed zeros on the board thanks to stellar defense. The Pioneers have been consistent on defense all season, but really put on a show Saturday, totaling seven sacks, three interceptions and 70 tackles. Ronnie Modik led the team with 12 tackles, and recorded a pair of sacks. With the win, the Pioneers improved to 2-3 and 2-0 in PSAC play. Post looks to even their record out this Sunday, when they hit the road against Millersville, coverage on 88.1 FM will start at 12:30pm with kickoff at 1pm.

            Freshman forward Eivind Austboe scored another two goals as the C.W. Post men´s soccer team battered Dowling University by a score of 5-1 on Saturday, October 1st. After nine games, the Pioneers are still undefeated this season.
Expectations were high Saturday in the Pioneers’ second East Coast Conference game of the season when they squared off against their archrivals, the Dowling Golden Lions. And, for once, the Pioneers were off to a quick offensive start.
Junior midfielder Andreas Olson began the scoring with his first goal of the day, as he twisted a shot from the right side to the left corner, only eight minutes into the game. The Post engine was started, leading to yet another goal a minute later when Austboe chipped an assist from Olson into the net.
The Pioneers continued their offensive attack, but it took 60 minutes until their next reward. The Pioneers showed their effectiveness, scoring three goals in eight minutes, with only one goal converted on a penalty shot for Dowling in the same time frame.
Austboe provided the Pioneers a 3-1 lead from his next goal with a 20 yard shot, giving him an impressive 11 goals in the first nine games. Only seconds after, freshman forward Arlind Nika ensured the lead, scoring the ball from 10 yards into the left corner. Dowling scored on a penalty kick a couple of minutes later to finally get on the board. But, the Pioneers weren’t done yet, as Olson adjusted the final result with a 10-yard shot into the net, leading to another win for the Pioneers.
The Pioneers thought they were in for a rough game and had huge expectations before entering the field. In front of an impressive crowd, the team proved why it’s undefeated. The Pioneers put on an entertaining performance, earning their win by a real team effort.  “Dowling has been so good for so many years, so this was a really important win for us,” Austboe said after the game. “We played incredible; everyone played so well that it became easy for us to win.” The Pioneer captain, sophomore Eirik Bjornoe, said, “We just get better and better every day.”
The Pioneers’ next game is at home against Millersville at 4 p.m. on October 5th.

The C.W. Post women’s soccer team went 1-1 last week, defeating the Wilmington University Wildcats 4-1 on Thursday, September 29th,  and then falling to the Dowling Golden Lions 3-1 on Saturday, October 1st.
In Wilmington, Delaware, freshman forward Morgan Kittlon led the Pioneers with two goals against the Wildcats. Sophomore forward Alexa Niciforo and senior midfielder Tove Eriksson also each scored a goal in the victory.
The game remained scoreless until the second half, when Niciforo put the Pioneers on the board first at 57:05. Seven minutes later, Eriksson put the Pioneers up by two, scoring from outside the box.  The Wildcats responded moments later, when junior Vikki Zipf was able to beat Pioneer goalkeeper Allie Weiser.
However, that would be the lone goal of the game for the Wildcats.
Kittlon gave the Pioneers a two-goal cushion, scoring the final two goals of the game in a span of two minutes.  She scored in the 87th minute on a breakaway and then again in the 89th off of a corner kick. The two goals easily secured the victory for the Pioneers.
Weiser made eight saves for the Pioneers in the victory, and the team held the advantage in shots 19 to 16.
Returning to Long Island to take on the Golden Lions at Dowling College, the Pioneers did not find the same success as they had in Wilmington.
The Pioneers fell behind early, as senior midfielder Karen Endresen scored for the Golden Lions one minute and 23 seconds into the game. Endresen scored again in the 14th minute of the game to make it 2-0 for the Golden Lions.
The Pioneers did not answer back until 81:25 into the game. Tove Eriksson scored off a corner kick that found its way into the far side of the net. The Golden Lions scored an insurance goal to make it 3-1 and to secure the victory over the Pioneers.
The Pioneers’ record stands at 4-4, but they are currently winless in East Coast Conference play (0-2). Allie Weiser made one save in the loss, and the Pioneers were outshot 13 to 10.
The Pioneers return home to take on the NYIT Bears on Wednesday, October 5th,, at 4 p.m.

The C.W. Post women’s volleyball team has lost two matches in a row after the team fell to the NYIT Bears on Thursday, September 29th. The 3-2 loss was the team’s 9th, dropping the Pioneers’ record to 7-9 overall and 1-2 in conference play.
The Pioneers came out strong in the first set. After working to a 12-12 tie, the team initiated an 8-0 run to capture the set and take the lead in the match. Sophomore Maka Namahoe and junior Lisa Delfs led the Pioneers with four kills each in the first set, and the team posted 14 kills with only one attacking error.
NYIT responded in the second set with a 9-0 run of their own. NYIT’s Ali Falbo went four for four in attacking attempts, achieving a 1.000 hitting percentage to help tie up the match at 1-1.
The third set of the match stayed much closer than the first two, as neither team was able to create a lead greater than two points. The Pioneers managed to regain the lead, however, when an NYIT attacking error allowed C.W. Post to win the set.
With the Pioneers just one set away from victory, NYIT broke away from a 16-16 tie to take the set 25-19 and force the game into a fifth set. Though the Pioneers fought hard in the deciding set, NYIT proved to be too much for the team in the end.
Sophomore Jordan Schroer finished the day with 17 kills and 16 digs on the day, leading the Pioneers, while Delfs notched 12 kills, and Namahoe walked away with 11 kills, eight digs, and 3.5 blocks. The team will take to the court again on Friday, October 7th, against the University of Bridgeport at 6 p.m. in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

At one o’clock on Sunday, November 6th, the C.W. Post men’s basketball team will face one of, if not the most, challenging teams of the year: the University of Connecticut. The Pioneers are coming off of a record of 21-10 in Division II, while UCONN is coming off of a season the team was the NCAA Division I National Champion.
Although it is an exhibition game, the team has been working very hard in the preseason and will treat it like any other game. When asked if C.W. Post planned on running any special offensive or defensive schemes against a team the caliber of UCONN, Assistant Coach Kareem Brown stated, “We will treat the exhibition game against UCONN the same way we would treat any other game that we would play against a Division II opponent. We may ‘tweak’ different sets or schemes that we use but, generally, do what we do best.” On offense, he wants to get out in transition, put different players in position to score, be aggressive, and share the ball. On defense, he plans on playing a tough man-to-man, while getting in passing lanes and pressuring the opponent.
With the return of senior guard Stefan Bonneau, who led the team in scoring last season, and eight other key players, the Pioneers are looking toward a good matchup, even with UCONN’s loss of Kemba Walker to the NBA Draft. When asked if he felt that UCONN is less of a threat without Walker, Brown stated, “Kemba Walker was a good player. And, even with the loss of him, UCONN is still a good team. They return a lot of key players from their championship team, so they will be just as tough to beat.”
Coach Brown views the exhibition against UCONN as another chance to prepare for the upcoming season and as a great opportunity for Division II athletes to not only play a Division I team, but to play the defending National Champions.
The exhibition game will more than likely set the tone for the upcoming season, and as long as the Pioneers keep working hard, it should be a long and exciting one.

   These days, it seems that walking to class has fallen out of style. Some students here at C.W. Post are now resorting to scooters and skateboards. What is it about scooters and skateboards that has allowed them to become increasingly popular on campus? Maybe it’s the thrill of riding down Chipmunk Trail and feeling a cold breeze blowing in your face, or maybe it’s just the excitement of getting to class quicker, and not having to walk. Well, whatever it may be, more C.W. Post students are seen flying down the halls of the dorm buildings and attempting simple tricks outside Hillwood Commons.
Rules are being enforced to prohibit scooters and skateboards in the residential halls, however. The rules say that you may not ride a scooter or a skateboard in any buildings. In fact, students are now facing fines if they are caught indoors playing or riding on them. A Sophomore Art Education major, who chose not to have her name mentioned said, “I have seen some girls on razor scooters going through the halls in the dorms, and through the hallway of Humanities Hall. Is that really necessary? It looks kind of fun, but I prefer walking. Or maybe I will try out a skateboard, outside the halls.”
Scooters and skateboards have become popular, especially in Brookville Hall. Students feel that this is something fun to do, and as long as they follow the rules, there shouldn’t be any consequences. Josh Kramel, Junior Physical Education major said, “ I think the new scooter trend is great because it brings kids together, and adds a bit of humor to the dorm.”
According to Residence Assistant David in Brookville Hall, “Scooters are not allowed, according to the C.W. Post Handbook of Rules. If a student is caught, they will be written up.”
It’s like Douglas MacArthur once said, “Rules are mostly made to be broken and are too often for the lazy to hide behind.” Clearly, this is true on the C.W. Post Campus. Maybe the fun part of life is doing something we know we shouldn’t be doing.
