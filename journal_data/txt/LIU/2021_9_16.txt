Addison Rae has officially made her big screen debut in the Netflix movie “He’s All That.” The 20-year-old media personality gained a following on the social media app Tiktok over the pandemic, recently reaching 84 million followers. Rae is the second most followed creator on Tiktok. 
“He’s All That” is a gender swapped re-telling of the 1999 film “She’s All That” starring Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze Jr. In the film, an influencer, played by Rae, makes a bet with her friend that she can transform the school’s biggest loser into the homecoming king.
Students on campus are reacting to the film, as well as Rae’s performance. 
“One night I come downstairs, and I see my dad flipping through Netflix and he puts it on,” senior musical theatre major Devin Butera said. 
Butera doesn’t think he would have watched “He’s All That” on his own, but he isn’t upset that he got roped into viewing the film. 
“I actually thought it was pretty good,” Butera said.
Butera noticed random dance breaks in the film that he felt didn’t make sense cinematically, but he thought they were a fun addition to some of the scenes. He believes it helped that he didn’t watch the film with very high expectations.
“Addison Rae wasn’t as bad[at acting] as I thought she would be,” Butera said.
Butera doesn’t believe Rae was given the role based on talent, even though her acting abilities exceeded his expectations.
“[I think she got the role] because of where she lives, what she looks like, who she knows, how much money she has and so much more,” Butera said.
Butera thinks there will always be someone better for every role out there, so it is impossible to speculate on potential casting. 
“There are literally a million other girls who you don’t know, who you still won’t know for a couple of years who you could have known from this movie,” Butera said. 
Though Butera wasn’t appalled by the film, he was still able to point out minor criticisms.
 “It feels like I’m watching a reality show when someone like a Kardashian comes on the screen,” Butera said.
Butera doesn’t think there is anything anyone can do to stop media personalities from taking over Hollywood. All he hopes is that they have good hearts and good attitudes when they do.
While Butera stumbled upon “He’s All That,” other students planned on watching the Netflix movie. 
“I spend a very unhealthy amount of time on Tiktok, and there was an obsessive amount of advertising for the movie on there. I wanted to see if Addison Rae was a good actress or not,” senior physical and health education major Jack Tomlinson said. 
Even though Tomlinson describes the dialogue of “He’s All That” as the worst he’s ever heard in a movie, he was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film as a whole. 
“I thought she did better than I expected, and for her first acting experience, I was proud. She should be proud of herself,” Tomlinson said.
Tomlinson acknowledges the fact that Rae most likely brought many eyes and views to the movie with her name power alone. He hopes this isn’t the permanent future of the entertainment industry.
“I think it’s a fad. It probably always will be there to an extent. But in a few years, it probably won’t be cool to see TikTok stars on TV anymore,” Tomlinson said.
“He’s All That” was released on Netflix on Aug. 25. The film ranked number one on the streaming platform six days after its release, only keeping that title for one day.

Students have noticed an increase of unusual weather events happening on Long Island. With the recent landfall of Hurricane Ida, students feel on edge with the increasing threat of climate change in the air. 
Over the past couple of years, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change has found less than promising news regarding global warming. They have warned that humans are nearing the point of no return, and if action to combat climate change is going to be taken, it must be taken immediately. 
The students that attend Post are from all over the U.S. and the world. They encounter all different kinds of extreme weather, and are equipped to handle those situations differently. 
Junior music education major Annie Rodriguez was born and raised in Long Island. She is no stranger to the extreme winds and rains the east coast can bring. She remembers a hurricane early in her life that wreaked havoc on her family’s property.
“Trees fell on my shed and on my fence, it took two weeks to get the help we needed to fix the problem. It was inconvenient and annoying. We also had no privacy because our fence was down,” Rodriguez said. 
Rodriguez has noticed the worsening storms over the summer, and says that it has caused her stress levels to rise.
“The fact that the temperatures are rising, [and] the ice caps are melting, I don’t know how our world is going to look in ten years,” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez worries about her future due to the uncertainty of the environment.
“What if I want to have children one day? Am I going to bring them into a world that’s just going to end or be unsafe to live in?” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez believes that petitioning, calling on representatives, and protesting in favor of environmentally-friendly policies can be an effective way to make a positive impact on climate change. She hopes that others continue to fight climate change as well.
Unlike Rodriguez, other students on campus come from out of state. Senior musical theatre major Sophie Quiñones has had to deal with extreme hurricanes and more since moving to Orlando, Fla. in 2014. 
“At this point, I’m almost desensitized to hurricanes,” she said. “When I first moved to Florida, within a week of me being there a hurricane hit.” Quiñones recalls the destruction that various hurricanes have caused to her family’s property. She has noticed the storms getting progressively worse since moving to Florida.
Quiñones has family in Puerto Rico as well, where hurricanes cause mass damage and casualties.
“Puerto Rico doesn’t have all of the resources that the mainland has. Oftentimes, we are forgotten. It makes me scared and nervous for my family there,” Quiñones said.
Quiñones is admittedly terrified of climate change. Even though she feels prepared for whatever extreme weather events are thrown at her, the thought still scares her. She also feels as though the real work to help the environment is not up to individuals like her.
“At this point, it’s up to the billionaires and the corporations. Me lowering my water consumption isn’t going to do as much as coming up with new regulations and guidelines to help battle and combat climate change,” Quiñones said.
Quiñones and Rodriguez both hope to live in a world where they don’t have to constantly worry about the future, and can instead focus on living in the present.

Students are back on campus after more than a year of uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Professors and students adapted to a virtual classroom environment after news of the virus broke during spring break of the 2020 school year. Now, campus life is making a return.
Senior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung recalls how she felt when she realized she wouldn’t be coming back to school after spring break ended in 2020. 
“I was terrified, honestly. As a music major, not being on campus and not having the facilities with pianos, or being able to sing with other people was a very scary experience for me,” Sottung said.
Sottung, like many other students, had to adjust to an online environment that was not ideal for her major. She had to buy a keyboard with her own money in order to complete her spring courses.
“The faculty in my department have tried their best to make everything as normal as possible, but I don’t think anyone can learn one hundred percent under these circumstances,” Sottung said. 
Sottung has missed many of her friends’ senior recitals due to the pandemic, something she has looked forward to since her freshman year. However, Sottung is thankful that she will be able to perform her senior recital in person this semester, and participate in other in-person events throughout the year.
“I’m going to take advantage of this year by going to every LIU event that I can and plan out everything on my calendar,” Sottung said.
While students involved in Post’s music department faced their own unique challenges as a result of the pandemic, other departments also had to readapt their education styles to deal with their own set of challenges.
“[I was] honestly a little nervous [when COVID-19 hit] because I didn’t know how I would be able to get in my observation hours if we were not allowed in the schools,” junior childhood education major Jackelyn Maltese said. 
Instead of in-person learning, the education department had to turn to online classes, and the resources and opportunities available to students weren’t always comparable to those they would’ve had if they were in-person.
“There were not many videos online that were good,” Maltese said. “Not being able to do group work together was hard because that’s when we would share our lesson plans we created and get input.”
With in-person learning finally back on campus, Maltese is looking forward to the opportunities that will come with being back. 
“[I’m looking forward to] being able to meet with professors in person when I need it instead of having to schedule a Zoom call,” Maltese said.
Students are also excited for the social aspect that in-person learning brings back to campus. Many students weren’t able to see their friends throughout a majority of the pandemic, and being back on campus has given them a chance to be with the people that online learning kept them away from. 
“I think the thing I will take advantage of most is seeing my friends who I have not gotten to see in a while, and try my best to meet up with them when possible,” Maltese said.
While some students are figuring out how to make their last few years on campus memorable, others are coming to campus for the first time. Freshman acting major Teddy Brock is still adjusting to this new environment in his first few weeks of school.
“Being in a pandemic made me want to go further away [from home], have a new experience, something I’d never have where I’m from. I’m from Atlanta. I wanted a change of pace,” Brock said. 
Brock was confused but excited when he first found out he would be getting two weeks off of school in 2020. He became more frightened when he realized all of the opportunities he would be missing. 
“I would miss connecting with the people in my last year of high school,” Brock said.
Brock social distanced and stayed safe throughout the pandemic. He attempted to fit everything that he missed into his summer after he got vaccinated. Now that he is on campus, Brock wants to make sure he is taking full advantage of everything that college has to offer. 
“I’m excited for meeting new people, making new connections and living in the present, appreciating art, and being excited to learn, study and learn what I love,” Brock said.
Students are looking forward to taking advantage of all the opportunities being afforded to them now that the semester has started in-person.

Greek life organizations across campus have been gearing up for their first in-person recruitment since the fall of 2019. 
Junior early-education major Marissa Angeli holds the vice president (VP) of membership position in Delta Zeta. VP of membership plans for recruitment for the sorority. Angeli was excited about the planning and process of recruitment, especially because it will be in person this semester. 
“I am so excited for recruitment to be in person this year,” Angeli said. “Recruitment is my favorite time of the year, and knowing we get to have it in-person again is the best feeling.”
Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment and other greek life events have been virtual, leaving many students missing the connections made when in-person. 
“I am most looking forward to actually getting to talk to girls face to face instead of through a computer screen,” Angeli said. “It is so much more personable and the conversations feel so much more natural when we are having them in the same room.”
Some students have yet to experience in-person recruitment, like junior musical theatre major Hannah Winston, who was recruited through continuous open bids that are outside of the recruitment process. 
Winston is a Panhellenic delegate for her sorority this year, which means she will be dropping her letters up until the end of recruitment to serve as an unbiased help for girls going out. 
“I am excited to see recruitment in-person this year since I never really got an in-person or virtual recruitment experience because I was a COB [continuous open bid],” Winston said. 
Sophomore business administration major Gina Symes has also never experienced in-person recruitment as she went out for recruitment in the fall of 2020 when the process was completely online. 
“Personally, I liked virtual recruitment from the perspective of being recruited. It seemed more relaxed than what I have heard about in-person recruitment, and was a shorter process as well. I felt very confident on the screen. While I had some nerves it was mostly an exciting process,” Symes said. 
While virtual recruitment was necessary at the time many students are looking forward to aspects they missed about in-person recruitment. 
“Girlishly of me, I’m mostly looking forward to the coordinated outfits we get to wear for in-person recruitment. That seems like a very fun aspect to implement into the recruitment process, Symes said. “However, more seriously, I think it’ll be more natural to form connections in person with the potential new members. Also, I’m excited to experience all of the traditions that are included in recruitment. I believe they’ll help me have a deeper knowledge of Delta Zeta as a whole.” 
Angeli is looking forward to making connections with new members in-person. 
“One of the ways that this year will be different from virtual recruitment is that there will be more opportunities to talk to everyone since in-person recruitment will go on more days than virtual recruitment did,” Angeli said. 
Winston echoed Angeli’s excitement.
“‘I’m looking forward to meeting new PNM’s, learning more about the other org’s processes, hopefully seeing PNM’s [potential new members] find their homes/sisters, and actually being in the room with other orgs and other people,” she said.
To any students thinking of going out for recruitment this year, Angeli and Winston encourage them to put themselves out there and give it a chance. 
“For anyone going out for recruitment who might be nervous is to just be yourself,” Angeli said. “We are all so excited to meet you and get to know you girls so try not to be nervous and just focus on being yourself.”
Symes agreed with Angeli.
“Be genuinely authentic and try your hardest to keep an open mind,” she said. “Also, enjoy the process. It’s so easy to get swept up in the pressure of it all, but at the end of the day, this is something you only get to experience once. Have fun with it and we’re all so excited to meet you.”

Social media influencers and internet culture have created an insatiable demand for a constant flow of new trends at low prices for students in the U.S., and that includes Post. Fast fashion websites such as SHEIN and ZAFUL have made clothing trends cycle so quickly that traditional retail stores, such as Forever 21 and Urban Outfitters, have difficulty restocking their inventory to meet consumer demands before a new trend goes viral.
“Fast fashion is basically trends that go in and out very quickly,” senior business major Alina Chen said. “In the past, we would describe it as fads. But [now], mass manufacturing has made fast fashion so common that it has basically become a staple in people’s closets.” 
Sophomore business major at Nassau Community College, Lauren Mehta, thinks that clout culture is the cause of these quick fashion cycles.
“Clout culture runs social media and it also goes hand-in-hand with fashion, causing all of the new trends to fade in and out of style so quickly … Everybody wants to have the coolest, newest, most unique thing to attract attention and praise. So once an outfit is posted [online], it feels old and unusable because it’s no longer unique,” she said.
Mehta frequently sees fashion inspiration and clothing hauls on popular social media apps such as Pinterest and TikTok, and she can’t help but feel the urge to buy new clothing.
“Unfortunately, I do get the itch to shop like every day, but when I do I always end up buying a majority of my clothes second-hand or from thrift stores,” Mehta said. “My closet is very large, so a lot of the stuff I own only gets worn a few times in a single year. After two years with the article of clothing, it starts to feel old.”
Chen believes that while social media is a key influence in so many people buying fast fashion items, it also gives students the opportunity to express themselves and their individuality.
“If you think back even just 10 years ago to 2011, or even 20 years ago to the early 2000s, you see that whatever was in [style] was what everyone would wear. And that was it. If you had your own sense of style, it was considered weird by most other people,” Chen said. “But nowadays, you see people wearing whatever they want and being embraced by society. You won’t be judged for it.”
While some fashion-followers might still look down on others for not keeping up with new trends, Chen advises people to wear what they love despite what’s in style.
“Fashion is a statement of who you are. If the people around you aren’t supporting you to express your most authentic self and pressuring you to just fit in, you should reevaluate who you surround yourself with,” she said.
Chen advises students to cultivate their personal style by considering how much they love their clothing, and how many times they will wear it.
“One of the reasons that I love fashion and am pursuing it [as a career], is because of the way that it makes people feel. You can be having a really bad day, but if you look really good, and you feel really good… It’s going to make your day better,” Chen said. “It’s all subjective to your personal taste. What matters is that what you’re wearing makes you happy. When you’re shopping, you need to buy what sparks joy. If you don’t love it in the dressing room, you won’t love it after you’ve worn it a few times.”
Because of the large influence that celebrities and social media personalities have, Chen warns that students may forget that it’s a celebrity’s job to sell their lifestyle online.
“I think that people follow influencers that they feel they connect with, and they feel like they relate to on some level. Most of the time, that includes relating to their style … But a lot of the time, celebrities are just being paid to promote their clothing. Like Kylie Jenner, do you like what she’s wearing and want to wear the clothing too, or do you just like her?” Chen said.
Another influence on individual style preferences is family members and friends. College students often determine what looks they want to replicate by seeing what their friends are buying and wearing.
“When it comes down to my style, I am most influenced by my environment. Like, when I go to class I probably dress more business casual than other students in different majors. And my mom is a businesswoman, so growing up, I always saw her dressed that way,” Chen said.
Sorority culture can also prompt members to buy new outfits in accordance with recruitment and themed parties.
“Wearing the same thing over and over again won’t always spark joy for you. And realistically, when you’re participating in all of these events and buying new clothes, you need to think about what you will wear again because some girls don’t. Sometimes, I buy a shirt from somewhere like Forever 21, and I only wear it for like Bid Day or something.”
While society often pressures people to keep up with the latest trends, a sustainability movement has blossomed over the past decade, specifically for Generation Z. Frequenting consignment and thrift stores is the most cost-efficient, but time-consuming way to shop more ethically.
“I think sustainability is one of the most important things to think about when shopping,” Mehta said. “The fashion industry is one of the leading causes of climate change, and I think it’s crazy to keep buying new clothes that have such an impact on the environment if old clothes work just as well and have less of an impact. When I was younger I would buy hauls of clothes at the start of school season and on Black Friday, but as I have become more environmentally conscious, I only truly buy what I need.” 
While it’s important to students to express themselves through fashion, effects on the environment due to the fast fashion industry are dangerous.
“I learned a lot about fast fashion and sustainability in a fashion merchandising class at Post,” Chen said. “For example, making denim has a detrimental effect on the environment. Is this cute skirt really worth the depletion of our ocean? Entire communities are affected by the pollution caused by the fast fashion industry … Know that your money has power. What you support matters.”
