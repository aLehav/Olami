Editor’s Note: In light of recent mass shootings in the U.S., the Pioneer is republishing the university’s guidelines and protocols issued in Feb. 2017 as a public service for the school community.
There have been 317 mass shootings in the United States, close to one every day, in 2017, according to the Gun Violence archive. The harsh reality of mass shootings is that they could occur at any place and anytime. Since 1999, there have been 31 mass school shootings in the United States, which have made worldwide headlines and devastated school communities. The massacres at Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and Virginia Tech University, among others, have led schools, including LIU Post, to strengthen their security protocols and strategize if it were to happen to them.
The LIU Post Department of Public Safety includes 22 full-time, New York State certified security officers. It is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors on LIU Post’s campus. The department works with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments, and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management. The Public Safety Department created its own guidelines in early 2017, based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s “Active Shooter: How to Respond” booklet, which includes emergency phone numbers and tactics. The guidelines are on the university website at http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety.
According to the university guidelines, “because active shooter situations are often over within ten-to- fteen minutes before law enforcement [or Public Safety] arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.” Within that time frame, the guidelines suggests to “take note of the two nearest exits,” “secure the door [in the room],” “if in a hallway, get into a room and secure the door,” and as a last resort, “attempt to take the shooter down.” If an active shooter is in your vicinity, the guidelines call to “escape if possible,” and “hideout where the shooter is less likely to find you while [remaining silent].” If you are the first person to call 911, the guidelines suggest to provide the phone operator with as many details possible, including location of the shooter, the number of shooters, if more than one, physical description of the shooter(s), number and type(s) of weapons, and number of potential victims at the location.
Michael Fevola, who became the Director of Public Safety in August 2017, said his team would rely on text messaging and emails during active shooter situations, although he has not experienced one on campus.
“In the event of an incident including an active shooter, Public Safety has protocols in place and the ability to immediately alert the entire campus community via a mass text/email blast with specific advisements and instructions,” Fevola said. “Those messages can also be used to continuously update the community, alert individuals what areas they should stay away from, and what to do, including the “Run/Hide/ Fight” protocols.” The Pioneer reported that the “Run/Hide/Fight” protocol was instituted in February 2017. “[It was] not in response to something happening, just to keep the campus safe,” Dr. John Lutz, English professor and chair of the faculty council, said in The Pioneer’s article, “Stop, Drop, Roll” published on Feb. 15, 2017. Lutz said, at the time, that faculty members had expressed an interest in learning more about campus procedures during an emergency, which led to a meeting for faculty on Feb. 1. At the meeting, Paul Rapess, the former director of Public Safety who retired last summer, discussed the new procedure, which implemented to keep up to date with happenings.
The Public Safety department routinely conducts joint training exercises with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments on campus. With this training in place, local police have a better feel for the campus during emergency situations.
According to LIU Post’s CampusFirearms & Weapons Policy, which is available on the LIU website under ‘University Policies,’ says “the possession of dangerous weapons, including any pistol, revolver, an incendiary bomb, switchblade, dagger or bludgeon, as well as harmless instruments designed to look like weapons are prohibited” on campus. “Other than police officers or military personnel on active duty, no person, including a licensee, may possess rearms anywhere on campus, whether in a building or on the grounds, without the prior written permission of the campus Provost and Director of Public Safety.” Violators of this policy will be subject to immediate disciplinary action and potential criminal prosecution. LIU Post strictly enforces its campus gun policy. As The Pioneer reported several years ago, on Nov. 17, 2011, a 72-year-old criminal justice adjunct professor accidentally shot himself in the groin and leg before his class. Although he was a retired Fire Marshall licensed to carry a weapon, the no weapons policy on campus was strictly enforced and he no longer teaches at LIU Post.
Katherine Hill-Miller, English professor and former dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences suggests every student and staff member should sign up for the Public Safety alerts, and said she would follow direction from Public Safety in an emergency.
“My first action would be to check for the text message and follow its directions,” Hill-Miller said. “If a message hadn’t come through, I’d assume that the incident hadn’t been reported, so I’d dial 911 first and then call campus security. Barring any information from anybody, I’d evaluate the situation—if the shooter was close, I’d gather students away from windows and doors in the classroom.”
Freshman education major Amanda Iovino agrees that the public safety alerts would come in handy in times of danger. “The texts are very useful in times of bad weather, and I think if [a school shooting] was to happen, the texts would be crucial.”
Fevola advises students and staff members to always be alert to their surroundings. While school shootings do not happen very often, he stressed that anything could happen, and one person reporting a suspicious person could potentially save lives.
“Stay vigilant and follow the old adage ‘see something, say something,’” Fevola said. “Any odd or unusual behavior should be reported to Public Safety, and we always protect [the] anonymity of the caller.”

The Winnick Student Center is the primary meal provider for students who live on campus. The menu at Winnick consists of an all you can eat buffet style, with an array of food options for students to choose from. This semester, some students have accused the dining hall of being unsanitary. Those claims are vigorously denied by Aramark, the campus food provider. Aramark provided the Pioneer with copies of recent Nassau County Department of Health inspections that refuted the students’ claims.
Ashley Damis, a sophomore broadcasting major who lives on campus, has noticed the center’s unsanitary environment. “When I am waiting to get my food, I notice the debris on the grill, and that’s not from food that just spilled, that’s from food built up for a while. If I couldn’t have a meal plan, I wouldn’t, but it’s mandatory that every student has a meal plan whether we want one or not,” Damis said.
Damis stated that she has stopped eating at Winnick this semester and now spends around $60 a week on food in addition to her resident meal plan. “I usually go to Hillwood for lunch, or to Winnick Express and grab a salad or sandwich and order dinner out,” she said. Damis also goes food shopping, which lasts for a week or two depending on what she purchases. “My mom knows about the issue, but since there is nothing she or I can do, she gives me money to spend on food,” Damis said. Damis has not raised her concerns about the dining hall with school administrators.
Winter Hughes, a freshman musical theatre major who eats at Winnick every day has not found it to be unsanitary. Although she claims that“there are barely any options and the food is tasteless,” she said that it is “fairly clean.” Hughes noted that they always have staff wiping the tables down and sweeping the floors. Yet, she too takes advantage of other dining locations on campus. “I would rather spend all of my dining dollars at the other food areas on campus. I take every opportunity to not eat at Winnick,” Hughes said.
Salina Webson, a senior criminal justice major who resides on campus has been eating regularly at Winnick since her freshman year. On Nov. 17, Webson was eating at Winnick when she drank from a cup with mold floating in the bottom. Webson immediately spoke to a staff member about the mold. “My experience is disappointing because I pay so much for food that is extremely disgusting. When I spoke to staff that was in Winnick at the time regarding the mold, [the woman] seemed surprised; all she said was sorry. If the drink machine had mold developing in it for this long, I’m not sure what else they don’t clean properly,” Webson added.
After finding mold in her cup, Webson decided to take further action and cancel her meal plan. She is still waiting to hear back about whether she will receive a refund. For the remainder of her senior year, Webson plans to eat out, since she works and has an internship off campus. “I don’t think they handled my situation properly considering my health and other students’ [health is at] risk,” Webson said.
“The machine that was in question was cleaned, sanitized [the] nozzle was taken out, all product was discarded. We are not quite sure [what happened], but we erred on the side of caution, we threw everything out.” David Conway, operations director for Aramark, said in response to Webson’s claims about the mold.
Justin Poly, Aramark’s food service director on campus and the former executive chef at Winnick Student Center, provided the Pioneer with the inspection report from the Nassau County Department of Health for Winnick. According to these documents, the latest health inspection occurred on Nov. 20. The inspection found four violations, including a machine observation that showed blocked or clogged airway pipes in the refrigerator, a squeeze tube in a product dispenser was worn and needed to be replaced to improve cleaning, and motor pumps were causing excess noise. There were no violations for unsanitary conditions or cleanliness found.
The university convened a focus group the week before Thanksgiving, with Aramark’s district manager, Michael Berthel, the dean of students, and Ashley John, the director of residence life. They sought feedback from the RA’s about what they hear about Winnick. Poly has not received information regarding the focus group. Some of the topics discussed were tables not being cleaned, lack of food options on the weekend, and chicken not being served from 2-4 p.m.
Students with concerns about Winnick may contact Aramark’s food service director, Justin Poly at Justin.poly@liu.edu.

After the implementation of 25 yellow bikes on campus on Friday, Oct. 13 to help students get around, there is hardly a single bike to be found after a few weeks.
The bikes were released with chains unlocked by the code 1954 – the year the university began. Students were expected to follow an honor code, riding the bikes from Point A to Point B, and then leaving them in the racks for other students to enjoy, but that wasn’t the case.
Bikes were being hidden in student dorms and in several different “hiding spots” around campus. “It kind of sucks when you have class on the other side of campus and when you go to get a bike, there is nothing there,” Kyle Eustace, senior Digital Arts and Design major, said. “Sometimes I am running a little late to class so I try to get a bike, and I’m screwed,” he added.
Some students believe the bikes were a good idea. “The campus is large and the bikes allow students to maneuver themselves around campus better,” Carly Franqui, a senior criminal justice major, said.
Other students liked the opportunity to exercise. “The bikes were a good idea because it promotes fitness, it gets students to hang out [with] their friends and have fun,” Ashley Damis, a sophomore broadcasting major, said. “But the bikes are being misused. They should have had a key code, and only been granted permission by the RA on duty,” she added.
While they had a good run, the bikes slowly faded away, never to be found at the bike racks.
Students are advised to report any issues or maintenance problems, with the few bikes that remain, to the campus concierge in Hillwood Commons, or call at 516-299-2800. Any issues are brought to the attention of the Facilities Department and Office of Public Safety.

“We need to take over the lecture hall next!” honors students cheered, as they reminisced about their most recent success. The Honors College may be known for several things, including long thesis papers, merit credits and Dr. Digby’s cats; but what about rebellion? On Wednesday, Nov. 8, Captain Ole Jolly Weird Beard, also known as Benjamin Gerdes, and his gang of merry students took a literal approach to their honors elective piracy class and declared mutiny on an unsuspecting Professor John Frazier.
Taught on Wednesdays from 2 – 4:50 p.m., “Piracy Through the Ages” is an honors elective course that analyzes and examines the social, cultural and historical gure of “the pirate” as depicted through the media, copyright laws and literature. From “Peter Pan” to ‘Treasure Island” and Jack Sparrow, each week Professor Gerdes breaks down the barrier between interactive learning and higher education in his classroom to push students to reach their potential without thwarting their creativity. “This is an experimental interdisciplinary honors elective on piracy in its various historical and present forms, so we consider how the traditional classroom experience can be influenced by pirates and others who challenged societal norms,” he said.
The idea to revolt and storm another class stemmed from Isabelle Rutens and Paul Bakey, both junior musical theatre majors. “Our friends are in that class,” Rutens said, when asked why she chose Professor Frazier’s playwriting class to storm.
Politely waiting until after Frazier wrapped up a phone call, the gang of pirate students nicknamed “Digby’s Army” marched down the hallway waving their flag, all adorning bandanas and eye patches with skulls on them – in typical pirate fashion. The students burst into Humanities Room 217B, with a chorus of “Args!”
Some marked their territory on the whiteboard with their gang name while others made off with students’ backpacks as pirates booty; a hostage was even snagged in the middle of things. “The initial mutiny represents a great first step in the sometimes awkward effort for a class to venture outside their respective comfort zones. Costumes always help. I look forward to even bolder moments of experiential pirate learning in upcoming weeks,” Gerdes reflected.
“It was a good beginning pirate step to our repertoire of mutinies,” Elise Ramaekers, a junior musical theatre major, said. Although there are no more mutiny excursions on the syllabus, you never know what a pirate might be cooking up. Your class could be next.

When students returned to campus from the Thanksgiving break, they found a new cell tower behind Hillwood Commons and across from WCWP radio station. The construction for the cell tower, which was installed by AT&T, began in mid-July.
Both AT&T and Verizon have operated their cellular services on the WCWP radio tower, but the radio tower did not accommodate the latest 4G LTE connection. “AT&T, has operated on the radio tower for years, but is coming to the end of its 3G usage limit Roy Fergus, director of facilities services, said. “Once all of the required equipment and systems have been established and are functional on the new AT&T cell tower, the existing/old truss lattice tower structure will be de-commissioned and demolished. The cell towers were duly vetted and approved by the local regulatory authorities. As part of this project, the WCWP radio antenna has always been scheduled to and will be attached to the new AT&T tower (a contractual requirement). At this time, this is the only official solution for the WCWP antenna,” Fergus said.
Students have had complaints regarding the cell service on campus. “The cell service on campus is exceptionally bad with service going in and out in a matter of a few feet or even just standing in the same place…on campus half the time I can’t place a call or send a text or Snapchat or do anything off the wifi,” Christopher Roerden a junior environmental science major, said.
“The cell service on campus is probably the worst I have ever seen. For example, whenever I’m in Pratt Recreation Center I always have a poor connection, whether it’s in the gym or the locker rooms,” Brian Cano, a freshman broadcasting major and member of the soccer team, said.
A pole that was installed this semester in the parking lot by Pratt Recreation Center is Verizon’s new 4G LTE tower and is also under construction, Jon Schneider, LIU’s director of public and media relations, said. “When both projects [the AT&T and Verizon towers] are complete, then students will have great 4G LTE connections” on both services, Schneider said.
“AT&T is excited to be building a network of the future on the LIU campus, to address the rapidly changing needs of students, faculty and visitors so we can deliver new and unique services quicker than ever before. This is part of our commitment to investing in and upgrading our network to help bring customers all the benefits they expect, including reliability, speed and overall performance,” a public relations representative from AT&T who requested not to be named said.

As students begin studying for finals, the stress begins to kick in. The uneasiness and angst can sometimes cause students to do poorly on exams. Luckily, the Be the Change and College Democrats club have come up with an outlet to help students handle the stress. From Dec. 4 to Dec. 7, the two clubs will be selling stress relief kits for $3 in Hillwood Commons, everyday during common hour.
Included in these kits will be items such as pencils, candy, tea bags, and tips on how to relieve stress and on meditation. “One of our core values in this club is to encourage people to take really good care of themselves and to keep themselves mentally healthy,” Adam Silverstein, a sophomore social work major, and President and founder of the Be the Change club, said.
“I think these kits […] will help make studying for finals less of a burden on them,” Matt Goldstein, a junior criminal justice major, and Vice President of Be the Change club, said.
Michelle Chan, a freshman believes that these kits are valuable if students are having a hectic morning and did not remember to grab a snack before the exam. “That is where the kit will come in handy,” she said. “It’s simple, handy and totally inexpensive.”
If you are a student who gets overwhelmed during finals week, you might want to check out the Stress Relief Kit event and purchase one to help yourself out!
The proceeds from this event will go to an organization called Challenge day, which is the basis of the Be the Change club.
For more information on this organization go to their website at www.challengeday.org or sit in on a club meeting Tuesdays in Hillwood room 108 during common hour.

LIU Post offers several on campus dining options, including Subway and Twisted Taco, but what about after hours? What about snacks? Where do you go when its 11:30 p.m. and you’re in the mood for an ice cream sandwich? Located in Winnick Student Center, Little Winnick functions as an on campus convenience store that stays open 5 days a week until midnight, after other campus dining options are closed. Yet, many students wonder if there’s much “convenience” in it at all.
Little Winnick provides an array of products, ranging from food to sanitary products for women. When the shop is fully stocked, you can find at least four different cereals, several frozen food and snack options, along with shaving cream, Clorox bleach and shower gel.
“I think students love the store; there’s something in here for everyone,” an Aramark Employee said. Little Winnick, even offers vegan and vegetarian frozen food and snack options for students. They restock items every other Thursday and if there is something in particular that you want and don’t see, you can even tell a staff member who has a list of requests from students that they pass over to the manager.
But part of the appeal of a convenience store is the affordable prices, and some students think that Little Winnick may be lacking these. “I think the hours are convenient but some things are a little overpriced,” senior health information management major Denzel Rodney said. Items like Wheat Thins and Poptarts can be found not far from campus at Stop & Shop and while on campus a box of Wheat Thins can sell for $5.49, at Stop & Shop they are on sale for 2 for $6.00. Even the store’s best sellers, Oreos and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, are available at a slightly higher price than normal retail with more than $1.30 added to the price. Many students feel that although the prices are too high, they don’t have many options on campus.
But not all items are overpriced. A share size box of candy gummy worms can go for up to $3.50 at CVS, but on campus you can get a bag for $2.60. Little Winnick is open Thursday – Monday from 8 p.m. – 12 a.m.

Many 21 year olds dance just when they’re in a good mood or are ready to hit the dance floor on a Saturday night. This isn’t the case for senior dance major Diamond Avant. Dancing for Avant is not just an extracurricular activity. Dance is her life and is something she wants to take beyond her college career. “To be a dance major, it takes a lot of focus and time. It takes dedication, determination, and a love for the art because if you don’t love it you won’t grow,” Avant said.
Growing up in a family of dancers, Avant had no choice but live a life full of dancing. Dance goes back for generations in her family. Her mother and her grandmother were both dancers. Avant started dancing, when she was two, at Wendy A Cutting Dance Studio, the same studio where her mother grew up dancing. Then in 2001, her mother opened her own studio that she named after her daughter – The Dance Diamond Studio.
Avant began dancing there at the age of five and from there she started with the studio in competitions at seven years old. Since age seven, she has been competing in solos, duets, trios, small groups, and large group competitions. Throughout all these competitions, Avant has has never lost.
She realized that she wanted to make dance her career when she starting looking at schools and saw that she could major in something she loves. She chose LIU Post for dance because most schools mainly focus on certain styles of dance and here she had many options of master’s classes to choose from. She is trained in ballet, tap, jazz, African, hip-hop, step, modern and contemporary. Avant says her favorite type of dances to perform are African, hip-hop, or tap. She likes anything upbeat or hard-hitting.
“She is such a hard worker; I really think she is going to be very successful in the dance world,” Sarah Meehan, a friend and former dancer, said. Being a dance major is physically and mentally hard. It takes a toll on her physically; it’s such a hands on major. It demands a lot from your body; you’re always dancing and rehearsing.
Being a dance major requires a lot of required academics as well as rehearsals late at night while trying to balance other academic classes. For anyone looking to major in dance, “it is a tough field, you have to work harder than the competition. There is always going to be someone out there that is going to want it more. You have to make it a priority or major in something else. You have to love it,” Avant said.
Along with going to school and rehearsing for her end of the semester show, she is currently working as the dance coordinator at the Glen Cove Boys and Girls Club. After graduation, Avant says her main goal is to move to the west coast and to dance on tour with a singer. Her dream is to go on tour with Beyoncé.
“There have been a lot of ups and downs and mixed feelings, but I honestly couldn’t see myself doing anything else,” Avant said.

Kirsten Manno, alumni and recent graduate of Post, is the owner of Hercules and Jasper the oddest pair of friends you’ll ever meet. Hercules, an eight year old 112 pound rottweiler is the biggest softie you’ll ever meet. And Jasper, an eight month old 12 pound kitten is the craziest kitten you’ll ever know.
Manno and family adopted Hercules eight years ago from Shake A Paw in Hicksville, NY. Hercules has diabetes, but he doesn’t let that stop him from cuddling up on the couch or sleeping in his very own giant beanbag chair. Jasper, the newest edition to Manno’s family was adopted from Last Hope adoption in Wantagh, NY.
Jasper, who may be part deaf, can be found darting across the house and getting stuck atop shelves all around the Manno household; he even plays hide and seek. The pair have become best friends since Jasper first came home, but that doesn’t stop them from getting jealous of each other. Just make sure if you visit, you bring enough treats for the both of them.

Michelle Chan, a freshman broadcasting major, has created a new show, “Savage Hour,” for the campus radio station, WCWP.
The Pioneer: What is a major project you’re working on?
MC: My major project is getting my radio show together on myWCWP.org. It’s going to be called ““Savage Hour.” You can check me out on Mondays nights from 6 to 7. It’s an actual live show online and on air at 89.7FM.
TP: What will you be discussing on “Savage Hour”?
MC: A variety of things actually. I’ll be doing some major music news, some of today’s entertainment news, and then a little bit of wrestling ‘cause I’m a huge WWE wrestling fan. I call it “savage” because I feel that best represents my personality.
TP: When did you discover that you were a big wrestling fan?
MC: Since I was five years old! The first match I ever watched was an Undertaker match, and from there on I fell in love with watching wrestling.
TP: What are your hobbies, besides radio and wrestling?
MC: I also like to write; I’m currently writing a fan fiction right now about wrestling and life. It’s a novella. It’s a little on the creepy side but then again, it’s a fanfic so it can be anything I choose, right? It’s not out yet so stay tuned for that.
TP: Where are you from exactly?
MC: My family was from China, but I was born here. I moved once from [Manhattan] to Queens when I was two years old, and then again when I was about eight or so, I moved to Syosset.
TP: When did you first get involved with radio and WCWP?
MC: Actually, I started going on the radio when I was in high school when I was in my sophomore year. I started doing it with a friend of mine and from there I developed a love for it, and I couldn’t get away from radio and what radio was all about, so I decided to make that my career [choice].
TP: What’s your plan for “Savage Hour”? How do you plan to get your audience?
MC: I have an Instagram page set up that you all can follow: @djmigd.wcwp and you can [go there] and get the latest news and updates.
TP: How long is ““Savage Hour”” going to be?
MC: It’s an hour long show and it’s going to be on Mondays, so for those who need Monday stress relief, that’s what I’m there for!
TP: Do you plan to have any guests on your show or do you plan to do this solo?
MC: I’m actually doing this solo right now, but guests are welcome. Just let me know in advance and we’ll try to make that work. You can email me at: djmigd.wcwp@gmail.com.
TP: Who are your wrestling heroes and radio heroes?
MC: My wrestling hero would be Roman Reigns. I like his strength and I like the way he owns what he’s doing. [As for radio heroes], a few like Ryan Seacrest for one. I followed his journey pretty closely. There are a lot of things we all can learn from him. And Elvis Duran, because I like the way he puts his show together and the way he goes about it with guests and all, so I picked up a lot from that as well. And he’s had a long way before getting his own show so that’s awesome and inspiring!
TP: What advice would you have for anyone, especially for any student, who wants to get into radio?
MC: Just get used to the environment of radio, because the [environment of radio] is actually very unique and it’s something you either like or don’t like. There’s really no “in-between” with that. And once you’re comfortable with the environment, you really start to get used to everything that goes along with it. And it really just comes down to enjoying the show, making it your own, and being yourself, because radio is the one opportunity where being unique [and/or] di erent is accepted.
TP: So what do you think wrestling has to offer for all of us?
MC: Quite a few things. One, even though wrestling can be fake, it is unique in its own way. For me it was a stress-relief thing, so we can all use it for the fun and pleasure of it. Also, it’s just something great to get your mind off of other things, like to escape life. Another thing is, wrestling offers a whole new way to look at life and people, and their characters. From wrestling, one can easily “align themselves” with characters within a storyline and relate to them which is the really cool thing about watching wrestling.
TP: How does LIU Post feel for you as a first-year student?
MC: You know, it feels great! LIU is very welcoming, everyone here is awesome, and people are super-sweet. And I’ve totally got a whole new group of friends from the Be the Change Club; a lot of the group members are also friends of mine. So, to say I am enjoying it here so far is an understatement because I am more than enjoying it—I am loving it, here at Post!

It began in the bathtub. After years of dealing with the haunting childhood memories and reprecussions of abuse in his foster home from the age of 3, David Hinchliffe, an adjunct English professor, revealed to The Pioneer that he is ready to recover.
“Looking back, I was somewhat like an emotional prisoner – trapped in a dysfunctional home in which no love was expressed to me,” he shared. Hinchcliffe experienced the “quieter, often underappreciated form of abuse,” when his foster guardian – he doesn’t use the term “mother” – neglected him and failed to care for his needs. “I felt like a thing,” he said. “Separate from ‘others’ who I thought of as ‘normal.’”
Hinchcliffe was abused in the bathtub by his foster guardian until he was 11 years old. This lead to a severe terror of water. “I confess that to this day I still get nervous, grip the car’s steering wheel more tightly,” he said, sharing his anxiety with driving over spans of water.
His foster guardian was only the beginning, as Hinchcliffe was abused by her grandson, who was two years older than him. He was just 13 years old when the grandson attempted to rape him, but Hinchcliffe somehow found the strength to fight off his advances.
Other members of the household – Pop, the abuser’s husband, and Jean, her unmarried, disabled daughter – were co-conspirators in the abuses. They stood by and did and said nothing, Hinchcliffe said.
Hinchcliffe utilizes his artistic creativity to explore his journey of recovery from abuse and to give hope to survivors of abuse. Hinchliffe wants to use his story to educate the world about post-traumatic stress disorder. “I consider the phase I’m now in [to be] the ‘healing phase.’” Hinchliffe perceives that his creativity will be used more through speaking, though he’s open to various avenues of creativity, whether through a book, a blog, or a podcast. “It’s all evolving,” he said.
The healing phase is complex for Hinchliffe. “It’s both extremely joyful and can fill me with a sense of contentment and gratitude for surviving and thriving and still being around to explore and expand and grow. Yet also challenging, to my emotions, to my way of dealing with myself. We have a mantra in the trauma community that says, ‘Be gentle with yourselves.’”
Hinchliffe coped with his experiences through music, sports, and nature. For abuse survivors, he advised involvement in the arts. “For anyone trying to survive, I highly suggest they get into the arts and anything that has [them] moving. It’s really helpful. It’s hard to explain.”
Hinchliffe also had some words of advice and comfort for survivors of abuse. “I think the first thing is don’t put too much pressure on yourself to do anything except to keep on going. When you are ready, maybe to talk about it and find the resources that help you, like a good therapist, a support group, even something online.” He advises survivors that when they are ready, to try to explain to loved ones as simply as possible, with as little emotion as possible. “You are a deserving, growing plant, and pay attention to the details of all that,” he said.
Regarding recent allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, including other allegations, Hinchliffe expressed certain caution about change. “Change is glacial, in my opinion; so I’m happy to see more discussion, more attempt at openness; but we have a ways to go.”
As for why abuse victims wait to report abuse, Hinchliffe stated that memory of trauma is not like other forms of memory. “The memory is in the body, and it affects the body. But the limbic brain, where memory is normally stored, is not [conscious] of what it feels in the body and what the event was. I think that’s why people take so long to report. They don’t have the language and they don’t have the perspective as to what happened to them.”

Thanksgiving has officially kicked off the holiday season and there are just a few more weeks of classes in the semester. Students are excited to be with their family and friends, finish their final exams, and eat their hearts out. Here are five tips on how to do this the right way:
Being careful with leftovers.
Food safety, the discipline of preventing food borne illness, is a huge influence on a person’s overall health; food poisoning can be preventable as long as leftovers are taken care of efficiently. According to the Centers for Disease Control, turkey should not be left out for more than two hours (even when cooked). The meat should be cut off the bone and all of the stuffing should be removed from the turkey if it is being saved. The leftover turkey, once refrigerated, should be thrown out after four days, unless it has been frozen.
Trying seasonal, fun activities to get you on your feet.
There are many ways to celebrate the holidays with family and friends besides eating and watching holiday movies. Burn off the extra calories by going ice skating in an indoor rink or outside, hiking, or skiing and snowboarding as the season progresses. After supporting Post sports, be sure to stay and exercise at the Pratt Recreation Center (open until midnight on weekdays and 5 p.m. on the weekends), there are free group classes throughout the week, personal training offered, a pool, and an indoor track. “Over the holidays I get exercise by running on a treadmill in my house and if I don’t feel like running I go to a yoga class with one of my friends,” said Rachel Vellis, a freshman criminal justice major.
Finding the healthy alternatives.
While there are exceptions to eating certain foods during the holidays, like turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes, there are ways to find alternatives and substitutions to make the healthier choices. For example, rather than egg nog, try vanilla chai tea; by itself, it contains little to no calories, fats, and cholesterol. Rather than taking extra desserts, grab another helping of vegetables.
Balancing stress the right way.
Eating a balanced diet, drinking enough water, and exercising helps to keep you happier, and less anxious as finals week approaches. Rather than “eating your feelings” at the dining hall which will just make you feel worse, take a break from studying to prepare and plan your meals and snacks. Keep your mind off of all that is on your plate; go for a run around campus or take a free yoga or pilates class offered throughout the week. “Whenever I start to feel stressed, I lace up my running shoes, plug into my music and run until it all goes away,” Lexi Zaino, a junior marketing major said.
Controlling portion sizes.
While it’s important to enjoy yourself over the holidays, it is also important to recognize moderation and not overindulgence. Rather than getting full plates of second and third helpings, or too many desserts, remember to eat enough to suffice your hunger, so that you’re full, but not feeling sick.
With Thanksgiving already behind us, this holiday season is going to go fast. Setting goals for yourself as well as making healthy choices will affect you greatly in this stressful time of year as well as mentally, emotionally, and physically in the long run.

When you are trying to live a happy and healthy life, it can be difficult if those surrounding you constantly put you down. Realizing that certain people are not good for you can take awhile, but when you come to this realization, it may become necessary to step back and befriend others who bring positive light into your life rather than a negative presence.
For some people, it can be easy to just simply cut someone out of their lives, but for others it can be a struggle. Many factors about their relationship come into play. This person may have been in their life for many years or if may be a family member. Putting up boundaries with the toxic person can be a start. You can start by not allowing yourself to hang out with him or her as much as you might usually do. You can contact them less and distancing yourself from them.
While removing them from your life, do not be scared to not be nice about it. Toxic people can be manipulative and try to persuade you into giving them another chance. In reality, people like this do not often change so do not continue to give them chances if they are not showing any attempt to change. The scene from the movie “She’s The Man” when Amanda Bynes breaks up with her ex-boyfriend because he puts her down for wanting to try out of the men’s soccer team and has repeatedly belittled her infront of many people. She handled the situation like a pro and removed him from her life right then and there.
Ending relations with anyone close can be hard, whether it was a healthy one or not. Remind yourself that keeping the toxic people close to you will never allow you to be truly happy and that is the goal. In the long run, it is for the best to surround yourself with positive people. By joining different clubs on campus that you are passionate about, you can find people with similar interests. You can also reach out to people within your major, considering you already have common interests.
You want people in your life that will support you and guide you. If you are having trouble in your life, you want to be able to talk to friends about it without worrying that they will guide you in the wrong direction or shame you for feeling a certain way.

Danny Schrafel (‘08) is a member of the Long Island Gay Men’s Chorus. He joined in September and performs as a tenor, the second to lowest vocal range in the chorus. The Long Island Gay Men’s Chorus is a not-for-profit organization that delivers musical performances to inspire and to provide everyone with greatness from the LGBT community.
Having studied journalism and history, Schrafel did not have much experience in theatre; his last performance before joining the chorus was back in the fifth grade. It wasn’t until he started singing at karaoke nights when others continually told him he had a natural talent for vocal performance.
Despite lacking the same amount of chorus experience as his peers, Schrafel wasn’t nervous to sing in front of a crowd. “Once the first couple of words come out of my mouth, the blinders go on and I’m good,” he said. Schrafel was encouraged to join the chorus during a game of bowling with the Monday Night Fourplay League. “There were a couple of guys in the league that I’m very friendly with who are very active with the chorus, passing flyers out,” Schrafel said, “They planted the seed in my head.”
The Long Island Gay Men’s Chorus recently performed their movie-themed cabaret event “Hooray for Hollywood” which featured songs from “The Wizard of Oz” and “Dreamgirls”. Schrafel sang David Bowie’s “Starman” and described it as, “singing 5,000 words,” due to the copious amount of lyrics.
Their next event, “Treasured Memories”, is a holiday concert on Dec. 15 at Cathedral Incarnation in Garden City. There will be another performance on Dec. 16 at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship at Stony Brook University. Tickets are $25 and can be purchased at www. ligmc.org.

The Call of Duty video game franchise has been around for 14 years. There are 13 games in the series. The most popular games in terms of sales are Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, released in 2011, and Call of Duty: Black Ops, released in 2010.
The franchise’s popularity began decreasing when the new games became overly-complicated and lost touch with the realism that the fans loved. The appeal of Call of Duty was the great story mode and awesome multiplayer gameplay option. Later on, the stories became boring and the multiplayer, dull.
Then, on Nov. 3 2017, Call of Duty: World War II was released and was highly rated by video game and entertainment media companies. It has an interesting story mode and included the mechanics of the original games that fans have come to know and love.
Students had great things to say about the new release as well. “I love how balanced the game is with different class, and HQ was the best addition to the game; it adds more realism.” Matthew Faulkner, junior digital design major, said.
“I really like the limited mobility of no jetpacks and also how well-themed the game is; it feels very real,” Liam Hendricks, sophomore environmental sustainability major, said.
The game takes place during World War II. The player is a United States soldier in the first infantry fighting in the western front in Europe during the last leg of the war. The first level makes the situation real; it goes from being just a game to the player realizing that the events depicted in the game actually happened. It makes the experience very surreal and somewhat saddening knowing that people experienced the actual events. The game does a great job of giving the characters humanity and making them relatable. The video graphics are also impressive.
The multiplayer gameplay setting is interesting and simple in this new rendition of the game, and it maintains the intensity and competitive feel that the old games had. It has traditional warfare without jet packs, drones or bionic dogs. It is a clear-cut first-person shooter.
The game still has its problems. One of them is that many of the multiplier maps are simple, small and dull. Another is the microtransactions which allow users to purchase virtual goods in the game.
Overall, I would rate the game a 4/5. It brought back everything the players wanted but still has more to work on when it comes to the microtransaction and the simplicity of some of the maps.
The game is available for purchase in GameStop and Best Buy stores and online at www.amazon.com.

Director Zack Snyder re-unites the Caped Crusader, Batman and the Man of Steel, Superman, with other heroes after last year’s disaster, “Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice.” This time, Snyder brings in, The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman, (Jason Momoa), Cyborg, (Ray Fisher) and Wonder Woman, (Gal Gadot) for the new movie, “Justice League.” However, can these heroes save the day? 
Snyder has undoubtedly been the most hated director in the DC Universe in recent years. He made the world’s greatest heroes and heroines look like the worst in “The Man of Steel,” when Superman ends up killing General Zod. Superman isn’t known for killing his enemies, so it was a bad idea to have him kill in the first movie. “Justice League” starts off at night showing Batman on patrol in Gotham City. Meanwhile, Superman is still dead, there’s a bomb threat in Paris and a talented football player has been turned into a machine.
Some heroes including Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash, had their debut on the big screen. Between Snyder’s script, Momoa’s stature and the reputation the actor gained from his role in HBO’s hit series, “Game of Thrones,” Aquaman is a complete beast.
Cyborg’s story in the film starts off slowly, as Victor Stone, a young man who had a bright future in football is already half man, half machine hiding from society in his father’s apartment. Eventually, the strong use of special effects and Fisher’s voice, allowed Cyborg to play his part for both the team and the movie.
Popular character The Flash is conveyed differently from Grant Gustin’s character on The CW’s show, “The Flash.” Miller’s character is a lot more childish and overall annoying. While The Flash is supposed to be childish, Snyder’s scripting for him seems like overkill to the point where his portrayal of the character is more of a highly-caffeinated child than a hero.
Gadot returns as Wonder Woman, and her performance is just as great as it was in this summer’s “Wonder Woman” movie. This time, more of the hero’s abilities are put to the test from deflecting bullets with her “bracelets of submission” to using the “lasso of truth” to interrogate the adversary.
Affleck’s portrayal of Batman is absolutely perfect. Snyder was able to bring to life the Batman seen in the comics by his use of gadgets and combat. In previous Batman movies, such as Christopher Nolan’s “Batman,” the character’s combat is very stiff; his grappling gun was nowhere to be found, but Snyder brought everything about the hero to life. Affleck’s Batman is very similar to comic writer Frank Miller’s interpretation of the original character in the story arc, “The Dark Knight Returns” with his stature and suit.
Superman is still Snyder’s Superman, however; audiences finally see what Superman can do in the movie instead of just fly and cry. Ever since “Man of Steel,” fans have been waiting to see Superman’s heat vision, X-ray vision, cold breath and super speed. Snyder’s Superman in the past was conservative as he was reluctant to use anything other than his ability to fly which defeated the purpose of his name.
The film’s plot is almost too simple which left critics and fans angry. However; there are three powerful devices called “mother boxes,” and an unfamiliar main antagonist Steppenwolf is after them with his cliché plan to destroy the world.
“Justice League” struggles to build up suspense since almost every event is predictable and there is too much computer-generated imagery in the wrong places. Snyder took a risk by using all of these new heroes, and it was just too soon. The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg needed their movies first. Aquaman is releasing in 2018 while Flashpoint and Cyborg aren’t hitting the big screen until 2020. “Justice League” is currently playing in local theatres.

Woori, a renowned bank in Korea, chose art professor Seung Lee, director of the fine arts program and graduate studies, to display his artwork in their 2018 calendar.
In 2011, the Korean Art Association named Lee Korea’s best international artist of the year. This led to him exhibiting at art shows around the world, including in Korea, Japan, China, Italy, and France. Lee has had almost 30 solo shows and over 200 group shows. 
Lee arrived in the United States from South Korea when he was 15 years old. His father passed away when he was five, and his mother could not find work in South Korea. As the youngest, Lee could not do much to help their situation. After his aunt married an American sergeant stationed in Korea, his family was able to move to the United States, and without knowing any English, Lee was enrolled in an American high school. “Because I could not communicate verbally, I found myself drawing,” Lee said. “Unfortunate situations made me get to the place I am today.”
Lee recalled his high school teacher collecting all of his artwork and applying to college for him. He could not have done so on his own because he had no one to help him through the process. “This is why I take teaching seriously,” Lee said. His teacher impacted him in a way he didn’t realize at the time. Lee studied at Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, MD.
For the last six to seven years, Lee has used trees as his inspiration for his art work. “I use trees to symbolize certain human beings,” Lee said. He wants to have nature represent his feelings and opinions without forcing them on his audience. “A tree can represent someone in a particular light, but the audience has the ultimate decision to either see his symbolism or just enjoy the tree,” Lee said.
In addition to his exhibitions, Lee enjoys judging art shows and competitions. He has judged for shows including Long Island Museum in Stony Brook, New York; Open Studio by Art Space in Connecticut; Long Island Art League; and the National Endowment for Art. Lee said judging helps him with his teaching. Because he sees various new styles and artwork and immediately talks about it in his classes, he is able to expose his students to recent artwork.
Lee teaches “Drawing and Painting,” to students of all years and leads a faculty-led study abroad course called “Art and Culture of Korea,” to Korea every two years. During his last trip in May 2017, he took ten students for two weeks. They visited historical sites in South Korea and five universities, and his students had the opportunity to exhibit their artwork with Korean students. “It was a fun and real exchange,” Lee said. If there is enough demand for the course, it may run every year.
Lee has been at Post for 28 years and feels grateful for his teaching position. “I just wish that art is more appreciated,” Lee said. “Our society doesn’t realize that art is what is going to leave our legacy behind as humans.”

First, glue six popsicle sticks together in the shape of a hexagon. Once the shape has dried, attach six additional sticks from each inside corner of the frame and connect them in the center. Glue more sticks to the outer edges of the snow flake. Add as many as you like to create an original design. Allow ample time in between each addition of popsicle sticks for the project to dry.
Next, once the entire shape has dried, paint the snow flake a wintery color such as white, red or blue. For more festive are, coat the snow flake in a thin layer of glue and sprinkle it in glitter. Let the glitter settle, and then carefully shake off the excess.
Lastly, tie ribbon or string to your shape to hang up the snow flake, fashioning the perfect D.I.Y winter décor.

After defeating Adelphi University, 3-0, on Thursday, Nov. 16 in Charleston, West Virginia the No. 4 ranked LIU Post Men’s Soccer Team are now the 2017 NCAA Division II East Region Champions.
It took junior midfielder Charlie Le Dula just 22:04 to score the Pioneers’ first goal, along with a second score coming four minutes later in the 26th minute from senior mid fielder Harry Pearse. Stellar defensive play and six saves from junior goalkeeper Oliver Hessner Hansen held Adelphi scoreless.
Senior forward Lukas Ostermann solidified the victory with a 65th-minute goal, assisted by junior mid fielder Vittorio Argeri. Argeri finished with two assists in the match.
The Pioneers, who finished 18-0-2 on the season, became Divisional Champions for the third time in four years. They topped off their season on a sensational 10-game winning streak, outscoring opponents 34-7 in that span.
“Winning the championship is an amazing feeling,” said Le Dula. “To do it against our neighbors is an even better feeling.”
De Dula, a junior from London, England, described the Pioneers’ championship season as a “fantastic” one. The mid fielder is now a two-time NCAA Division II East Region Champion and three-time ECC Champion.
Another year, another successful season from the LIU Post men’s soccer team.
