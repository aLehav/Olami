On Wednesday, March 28, the Student Government Association (SGA), administrators and staff members held a Town Hall for students in the Gold Coast Cinema. Twenty five students attended, and posed questions to staff from the offices of LIU Promise, enrollment services, facilities services, healthy living, athletics, public safety, and dining services.
Ashley John, director of student engagement at LIU Promise; Sara Panarelli, director of LIU Promise; Ilkania Maldonado, director of enrollment services; Roy Fergus, director of facilities; Lynn Schwartz, director of healthy living; Debbie DeJong, director of athletics and recreation; Michael Fevola, director of public safety; and Dave Jagsarran, Aramark’s director of catering services, addressed student questions and concerns.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, facilitated the Town Hall. SGA vice president Olivia Kavanaugh, explained the importance of Town Hall meetings to give students a voice on campus issues. SGA president Giovanna Domingo ensured that all students had a chance to speak and passed the microphone around to students.
Campus Life & LIU Promise
One area of concern involved the administrative offices of Campus Life and LIU Promise. Students complained about the success coaches’ “lack of knowledge of major requirements,” which has resulted
in students graduating late and spending more money on their education. Sara Panarelli addressed this issue. “As academic programs change, we try to look at as much academic information about those changes from the departments. We have increased staff training for the success coaches, so [they] can be more well-versed in specific areas,” she said.
Panarelli encouraged students to be aware of program requirements, to use the online bulletin, and to reach out to the associate directors in the promise office if they need help.
One student stated that Post puts more effort into adding new programs than bettering the programs they already have. Berthel said he “certainly [doesn’t] think that we give less attention to already existing programs.” When there is interest in a program that doesn’t exist, Post staff work to get the program added
to “create a great experience at the university” and to compete with other schools, according to Berthel.
Campus Security
A student requested an increase in security on campus. Fevola, director of public safety, explained that the guards in each residence hall at night are monitored on camera to ensure that they are not sleeping and are paying attention to any suspicious activity.
Post is not a closed campus, but at night there is a guard on duty at the entrance. Despite student complaints, Fevola said the guard booth is not empty, and if students do not see a guard there at night, they should call or email him. “[From] 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m., the gates should be closed and there should be a guard in the booth checking license plates and IDs,” Fevola said. An officer would not be in the booth in inclement weather, when public safety is short staffed, or when there are 100 or less people on campus.
Newly installed speakers near the Tilles Center, Hillwood Commons, the baseball field, and fine arts buildings have been positioned to communicate urgent announcements to students.
Sexual Assault
One student raised the issue of sexual assault, noting that students who assaulted other students are still allowed on campus. The panel did not respond about the status of students who allegedly committed assault on campus.
“We have a partnership with the NY state police, they have a campus division. There was a special investigator here helping public safety,” Fevola said. The NY state police provide public safety officers with Title IX and domestic violence training annually.
Residence Life
Students raised concerns about residence halls. The heating and air conditioning systems in the residence halls was the first. “All of our dorms have heating of course; at a certain time we do cut it off based on the temperature outside, we work very closely with the different departments, facilities included, to figure out the best times to turn the heat and air conditioning off,” John said.
The furniture and cleanliness of residence halls was also discussed. Students are not pleased with broken furniture such as drawers in rooms, dirty showers, ripped curtains, and bugs in the bathrooms. John offered to speak with students personally after the Town Hall to discuss those concerns. Both John and Berthel promised to fix these issues.
John explained that campus life has partnered with facilities services to create ongoing one-year, five-year and ten-year plans for all residence halls. Berthel added that the halls have already begun to be updated, and in many of the halls, there is new furniture, hardwood floors and paint.
A student expressed concern about mold in Brookville Hall, as well as asbestos in Pell Hall. Berthel, who was unaware of the issue, promised to look into it, explaining that there are frequent air quality tests conducted on campus. The health department also visits Post campus regularly to ensure students’ health is not in jeopardy.
Athletics & Pratt Recreation Center 
A student athlete raised concerns about the quality of training with trainers, off-season training for tennis, and indoor tennis courts. DeJong, director of athletics, responded. “More off-season [training] is definitely something we can look into. We have strength trainers that you can work with in-season and out-season, whether coaches are around or not,” DeJong said. This year, all student athletes received a survey that allows DeJong to get feedback about problems that are occurring.
Another student asked for renovated locker rooms and the addition of a sauna in Pratt. DeJong explained the Pratt is made out of brick walls and it is costly to make changes to concrete walls. “But, I did meet with the director of the recreation center yesterday and we spoke about having a strategic plan,” she said.
Another issue in Pratt is the lack of light on the indoor track. DeJong said that they will look into adding lights or windows and work to keep the Pratt modernized and improve the facilities.
Center for Healthy Living
One student wants the center for healthy living to be open on the weekends for emergency counselor sessions. “I am always available and going to public safety is the best thing to do because they know how to reach me; I am on call 24/7,” Schwartz said. She also said that if she is not available, her associate director, Cindy Woldar, is available to help students. Students also want the center to be better advertised through promotion and social media, and for it to be moved to a more accessible location. Berthel said that there have been discussions to move the center, which is now located in Life Science room 154, to a more centralized area.
The panel of staff and administrators promised to look into all of the student concerns. This was the second Town Hall this school year, the first was in the fall.

Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the Tilles Center on Tuesday, March 27 as part of the LIU Global Institute speaker series. Biden tackled foreign policy and national security issues as well as new initiatives to fight cancer. There was an audience of hundreds of students, community members and local politicians, including Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas, Nassau County Executive Laura Curran, and U.S. Representative Thomas Suozzi.
Biden was invited to LIU by former Congressman Steve Israel, the Chairman of the LIU Global Institute, who knows Biden very well. They worked together in Congress when Biden was a senator and also during the Obama Administration when Biden was the vice president and Israel was a congressman. Biden and Israel were drawn together because they both grew up with similar socioeconomic backgrounds, and they both have a strong interest to advocate for the middle class, allowing them to form an “ideological king- ship,” Israel said.
Morgan Kashinsky, a junior criminal justice major, had the opportunity to meet Biden at the lecture, and became emotional. “As a survivor of sexual assault and domestic violence, it was very surreal, validating and humbling to meet former Vice President Biden. He has always and continues to use his position to uplift women, and I was grateful to be able to thank him for his service,” she said.
Madeline Nunley, a senior digital art and design major and member of the honors college, also attended the lecture. “Going to see Joe Biden at the Tilles Center was definitely an experience I will never forget; he gave off such an honest and real sense of himself that it was really beautiful,” Nunley said. “You could really feel how genuine the man was and how he spoke from a place of knowledge. He was speaking with conviction which was really refreshing to hear,” she said.
Vice President Biden began his speech by referring to advancements in technology. “Fewer people over the last 15 years have been killed and/or lost in conflict than anytime in human history [because of technology],” Biden said. He said economic growth, which makes America safer and stronger, has to be modernized to deal with the pressures of the twenty first century. When Biden reminded the audience to stand up and defend the world order for our own safety, stay engaged and “reject this alt-right, half baked nationalism,” he received a standing ovation. “They call it putting America first; I call it putting America alone in the world,” Biden said.
Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin is doing everything in his power to deconstruct that order, weaken NATO, undermine western democracies, and break apart the trans-atlantic partnership between Europe and the United States. Biden warned that without a stable Europe, we are unable to exercise our positive power around the world, and are significantly weakened.
America has made important steps, he said, describing the treasury department sanctions against Russia a few weeks ago, and President Donald Trump’s act ordering the immediate expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats who were identified as intelligence agents, and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle. These actions were taken due to Russia’s alleged use of a nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy living in the United Kingdom.
“We need actions that will alter the Kremlin’s calculus,” he said. In the fifth year of the Obama Administration, Biden’s security team held a five hour meeting with Putin’s security team. Putin then invited Biden to his office. “Jokingly, I stood there and said ‘my lord, it’s amazing what capitalism will do,’” he said. “I stood there, looked him in his eye and said ‘Mr. President, I’m looking in your eyes, I don’t think you have a soul. Putin looked me back in the eye and said we understand one another,’” Biden said.
The audience was not entirely filled with supporters of Biden. During the speech, a heckler began to yell loudly from the front of the auditorium, but he was quickly escorted out of the Tilles Center by security officers.
Biden discussed continued efforts to protect our cyber security. “We need to work harder to reduce the vulnerability and strengthen the resilience against Russian meddling,” he said. He suggested improving cyber maintenance and security by protecting computer networks and demanding transparency.
Another point Biden addressed in his speech is how cancer has personally affected Biden’s family. He talked openly about the death of his mother due to colon cancer, the death of his father-in-law and mother-in-law from cancer, and the death of his son Beau in 2015.
Biden has developed a strong initiative on cancer research. His goals are to create a venture to continue progress in cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and care. Biden believes there is a lack of access to information concerning cancer research. “I can find out what movies are playing in Rochester, New York right now, but I can’t go on a cell phone and find out what experiments are taking place, what is being done in various studies or if you can get into one of these studies,” he said. He talked about IBM Watson, a cognitive computing system designed to support oncology physicians as they consider treatment options with their patients.
Biden closed his talk with his view of Congress. “We don’t know each other. We need to start talking to each other because most of these members are decent people, but they get blinded by all of the attacks on motive,” he said. “You can not run this country institutionally; you must gain the public’s trust.”

Kristina Huderski, a senior broadcasting major, journalism minor, and Jacqueline Escobar, a freshman education major, were awarded Folio Awards by the Fair Media Council on March 29 at a ceremony at the Garden City Hotel.
Both award winners are members of the Pioneer, who were recognized in the long-form feature story category for stories published in the Pioneer. Huderski, the Pioneer’s features editor, won for her story, “Dance Student takes on Broadway,” published on Feb. 21, 2017. The story profiled dance major Rhaamell Burke and what led him to Broadway.
Escobar, who joined the Pioneer as a staff writer during her first semester at college, won for her story, “To Counter Prejudice? Excellence is the Answer: Overcoming Labels,” published on Nov. 14, 2017.
Alumna, Jennifer Shepardson (’16) also received two Folio Awards for work done at her internship with MYLITV.
The Folio Awards are hosted by the Fair Media Council, a non-profit organization that “advocates for quality news and works to create a media-savvy society in a media-driven world.” The event was dedicated to John Kominicki, the publisher of the New York Press, who passed away in December after a brief battle with cancer.
“On behalf of the Fair Media Council Board of Directors and the judges, congratulations to this year’s Folio winners, representing the best in local news and social media,” Jaci Clement, CEO and executive director of the Fair Media Council, said. “The entries were outstanding works of journalism, telling stories that matter and providing the public with the news and information they need to know,” according to the Fair Media Council’s website.
New York Times White House Correspondent, Maggie Haberman spoke at the awards luncheon in a Q&A format with Clement about her experiences covering President Donald Trump, the White House, and her role in covering some of today’s top stories.
Haberman has interviewed Trump in person and has covered him on and off since 2011. “There were only about five of us from the original press core, who stayed with him from the beginning,” Haberman said.
Haberman noted that Trump doesn’t like negative media coverage. Clement brought up Trump’s March 11, 2018 tweet referencing the “failing New York Times” and what he called “a false story” about his displeasure with his legal team on the Russia case. “The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access,” Trump wrote in the tweet. Haberman retweeted Trump, responding “lol.”
Haberman stated that Trump hasn’t changed since becoming President. “He was very anxious about his job, you can’t fake being president,” Haberman said.
Tamsen Fadal and Dan Mannarino from WPIX11 News announced the award winners, while the audience got a sneak peak of the video and audio pieces that won awards.
Winners included WPIX11 News, NBC New York, and CBS New York. LIU Post was the only university which received Folio Awards.
Editor’s Note: Caroline Ryan, the editor-in-chief of the Pioneer, attended the Folio Awards on behalf of the Pioneer.

On Thursday, March 19, facilities services began a reconstruction project of a classroom that wasn’t meant to begin until the end of the spring semester. The early demolition of Pell Hall room LS20 disrupted several classes that were still meeting there. After complaints from students and faculty, facilities services allegedly restored the classroom to its former condition, effective Monday, March 26.
After an investigation of the area in question, the Pioneer discovered that the room LS20 was in fact, not restored.
“That room was slated for construction at the end of the semester – it was a mix up,” Roy Fergus, director of facilities services, said. “There was demolition done there, and we needed four days to reset it – which we did.”
Students questioned why the construction was being done in the first place. “To frame where LS20 ended up having to be reconstructed, we are in fact doing a project that’s important for accreditation purposes,” Fergus said.
The reconstruction project was ordered to begin by university President Kimberly Cline at the end of the semester to create a space for the new veterinary technology program beginning in fall 2018. Space in room LS02 will be reconstructed to be a multipurpose laboratory and classroom for the vet tech students to work in, according to Stacy Gropack, dean of the college of health professions and nursing.
Facilities services is beginning to organize projects for the summer. “The areas identified for vet tech are ready, meaning we have fully vetted the process – we won’t have any more mistakes,” Fergus said.
“The space (LS02) is being outfitted with tables and chairs, countertops and areas for equipment that will be needed for the veterinary technology students, as well as offices for the faculty,” Gropack said. “We will have the most sophisticated equipment to assure that our students will be exposed to the most up to date technology in order to be successful as veterinary technologists.”
The equipment for the vet tech program will include anatomical animal models, anesthesia machines, centrifuges, clinical chemistry and blood analyzers, microscopes, simulation models, ophthalmoscopes, and pulse oximeters.
The construction for the vet tech program and facilities services’ other summer construction projects will begin the day after the Commencement Ceremony. “Our plan is to be ready for the fall,” Fergus said. While the vet tech program will be working primarily out of LS02 and with local animal shelters and pet hospitals, Fergus said that there were other projects set in other buildings for a veterinary science school, but did not disclose which buildings those were.

Students access their residence halls through the main entrances by swiping their student ID cards. Although the residence halls have side doors, using the side doors as an exit is prohibited between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., and students caught using side doors during those hours are fined. The main entrances are a mandatory access point because cameras are in place to monitor who is walking in and out; there are no cameras at side doors.
Yet, many students prop open side doors for easier access. Because this is a security issue, the Student Government Association is working with public safety and campus life to allow side door card swipe access to residence halls.
Residents of Brookville Hall are the first to experience side door access. As of Monday, March 12, public safety has been monitoring side door entry to Brookville Hall in a pilot program. If the program is successful, side door access may be granted to other residence halls.
Brookville Hall residents received an email on Wednesday, March 21 from Campus Life, which stated: “Dear Brookville Hall Resident, this email is to notify you that all residents of Brookville Hall have access to the Southwest Door, facing the Pratt Recreation Center. Please note residents will have access to enter the door between 7 a.m. – 11 p.m. After 11 p.m. no resident is permitted to enter or exit the side doors, regular side door policies apply and a $50 fine will be issued to any violators [anyone who violates this rule]. This pilot program will be monitored by Public Safety and Residence Life for the next couple of weeks. The purpose of this initiative is to decrease side-door propping which is a safety concern.”
With students propping open side doors throughout the day, anyone can walk into a residence hall undetected, creating a safety issue. The Brookville side door was chosen based on the number of student athletes who dorm in Brookville Hall and to allow them a quicker route to the Pratt Recreation Center, according to Giovanna Domingo, SGA president.
The side door access in Brookville Hall is not permanent. Director of Public Safety Michael Fevola and Dean of Students Michael Berthel agreed to give side door access a try, but only after they installed a camera at the exit. “It is still too early to tell if we will expand the program. We will begin to look at the data and get feedback from the Brookville residents next month before making a decision,” Fevola said.
Kristen Olsen, a senior education major, who lives in Brookville Hall, said side door access is a good idea and it could be safer than before. “I think that we should be able to enter through the side door because even when we didn’t have permission to use them, all students used them anyway and propped them all through the day and night. Now that we can swipe in, the door will not have to be propped and now not just anyone can walk in,” Olsen said.
Other residence halls have side doors as well, but whether or not they gain side door access is up to the success of the pilot program.

On Thursday, April 12, LIU Post will hold its fifth annual Relay for Life. The event begins at 7 p.m. in the Pratt Recreation Center. All proceeds raised during the evening festivities will be donated to the American Cancer Society, an organization with the mission to celebrate life by saving one life at a time.
Relay for Life is a team fundraising event where members take turns walking or running around a track overnight to signify that cancer never sleeps. Money raised will be used to treat patients and to continue research for new cures. Last year, Post raised $52,000. Volunteers, students and faculty this year are seeking to replicate this success and continue down the path towards a better world, according to Julia Pagano, residence director and coordinator for Relay for Life.
Fundraising for the cause is the primary objective, but Relay for Life does serve other purposes. The event spreads cancer awareness by remembering those who have lost their ght, those who beat their disease, and those who continue to fight to this day.
According to Pagano, all residence halls, Greek organizations and clubs are involved with Relay For Life. The LIU promise office, Center for Healthy Living, and numerous other departments are also signed up for the event.
Members of the Be the Change club have also taken a stand. “Relay for Life is an extremely important event to me because it is our time to come together as a community to ght back against cancer,” Adam Silverstein, founder and president of Be The Change, said. “It is extremely empowering to see us all come together in support of a cause like this.”
Through it all, the Post community is united, connected by a common goal. “Cancer has affected my family, and I am sure many others,” Pagano said. “I believe if we all work together to raise money and awareness for the cause, a large impact can be made.”
The first lap of the entire occasion is referred to as the “Survivor Lap.” During this special moment, all cancer survivors present take the first lap around the track. This commemorates their personal victories over cancer, while being cheered on by their loved ones who line the track.
Other activities include an opening ceremony, followed by a community walk, keynote speakers, music, games and food. “The evening is a high-spirited event that brings together our entire community,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said.
LIU Post has raised over $150,000 in three years. All students are encouraged to participate and join the cause. For more information visit http://www.relayforlife.org/liupost.

Louis Copertino, a sophomore public relations major, is the newest residential assistant of Riggs Hall as of March 2. Residential assistants are normally chosen by application at the end of the academic school year and are trained over the summer and during new student orientation to prepare for their RA duties. The position in Riggs Hall opened halfway through the semester, after the previous RA switched residential buildings.
“Being a residential assistant was the right decision for me because it is a great way to meet people. I am a social person and love meeting new people. I was looking for more responsibility on campus and wanted to get more involved with campus life and promote LIU Post because it’s a great school,” Copertino said.
Copertino was recommended for the position by Alejandro Lopez, campus life coordinator of Post Hall and the South Residence Complex (SRC). Lopez saw potential in Copertino and believed he would be right for the job.
However, Copertino did not initially want to become a RA due to his “hectic” schedule. A public relations major and sociology minor, Copertino also balances his classwork with being a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE). “Between schoolwork and Greek life, being a RA didn’t seem right for me at the moment. I had a lot of schoolwork, fraternity obligations, and other responsibilities, and it seemed a bit overwhelming to take on such a large responsibility,” Copertino said.
Copertino thought it was too soon in his college career to take on commitments. “I remember I went home for the weekend and spoke to my sister about the opportunity, she was mad that I declined the offer,” Copertino said. Copertino’s sister convinced him that being a RA was a great idea because it would look good on a resumé and that he would learn organization, independence and responsibility. After a week of debating, Copertino accepted the offer.
Copertino underwent a thorough two week interview process. The interview was broken down into sections. “I first met with Joe Vernance, associate director of campus life and Matt Blanar, assistant director of campus life. They asked what would I do in cases of emergencies to test me to see if I can think quick on my feet,” Copertino said. The next part of the interview included discussing his interests and schedule with Ashley John, director of campus life and Michael Berthel, dean of students.
“I remember my first day on the job. I did room checks with RA Heidi, did rounds of checking the halls, and hung up yers for Take Back the Night,” Copertino said. There are a total of six RA’s in Riggs hall. “Even though Louis came mid semester to our RA staff he has already made a huge impact in our Riggs hall community. He is extremely motivated to learn new things and to make a positive experience for all the residents,” Heidi Ritko, a senior digital arts and design major, said.
Copertino has been on duty for about a month and a half. “At this point in time I am very happy that I took the position,” he said. His advice to anyone interested in becoming a residential assistant is to always keep an open mind and to expect the unexpected. “In a lot of situations you have to think quick on your feet, always remain calm,” he said.
Copertino learned the importance of teamwork and how respect and communication with your co-workers is crucial. “I think Louis as a RA is responsible. He takes being a RA very seriously and respects the residents very well,” Brandon Mohan, sophomore and digital art and design major and resident of Riggs Hall, said.
“The best part about being a RA is meeting new people and being social with the campus community,” Copertino said. Copertino hopes to be a residential assistant next fall as well as become an orientation leader.
The application deadline to become a RA for fall 2018 has already passed, but will begin again in spring 2019. LIU Promise sends out in- formative emails to students at the end of February.

LIU Post students have learned that discussions are underway for New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) students to reside in dorms on the LIU Post campus. NYIT and LIU Post are close neighbors on Northern Blvd. NYIT currently houses approximately 300 students in dorms on the SUNY Old Westbury campus. Discussions about NYIT students living on Post’s campus have been progressing throughout the semester.
“From time to time, the university is approached by third parties to discuss opportunities of this nature,” Michael Berthel, dean of students at LIU Post, said. “NYIT has approached LIU about possible residential housing partnerships, but no particulars have been established or commitments been made at this time.”
The benefit for LIU Post students would be possible access to the NYIT shuttle route, which would allow Post students easier and regular transportation to the NYIT Academic Health Center if they are in need of medical advice or treatment.
The Pioneer reported on April 4, 2017 that Post has been without a registered nurse on campus since spring 2017, when Constance Montalbano retired.

Sophomore broadcasting major Nick Mattina took the reins in the WCWP sports department as former sports director Tom Scavetta (‘17) stepped down on March 26.
WCWP Director Dan Cox commended Scavetta’s role in rebuilding the sports department at the campus radio station. “Tom has done an outstanding job rebuilding the WCWP sports department during his tenure and I am grateful and appreciative of his service. Tom leaves the department better than he found it and has prepared Nick for this leadership position,” Cox said in an email to the staff announcing the change. Mattina will be assisted by sophomore broadcasting major Matt Weinstein, who will be the assistant sports director and coordinator of on-air talent for the sports department.
Scavetta was a member of WCWP for 4 years, both while he was a student and after he graduated, working as the sports director for the past year and a half. Scavetta is emotional about the change. “It’s been the best experience of my life, I’ve met a lot of lifelong friends and we took a department from 5 to 20. It wasn’t an easy process, but it was definitely worth it,” he said.
Scavetta’s job as sports director for WCWP helped him develop a new appreciation for business in sports. He plans to earn his MBA so he can direct sports on a professional level, and will attend either Quinnipiac or Sacred Heart in the fall. Until then, Scavetta will work with the New York Lizards, a major league lacrosse team that plays at Hofstra. While there, he will assist in their day-to-day game operations, rotating from sideline work, to the booth, and even sales and retail.
Mattina feels prepared for his new position. He received training from Scavetta on everything from how to handle the department and people to helping staff with critiques to make their broadcasts better. Mattina expects to lead the department by becoming everyone’s friend; he wants the staff to learn from their mistakes and give one on one attention to each and every member. “I think I am going to love this new position; I’ve been ready for it for a while and I am excited to finally take the helm,” he said.
Mattina has always had a love for sports. He grew up watching hockey and always wanted to broadcast just like the guys he saw on TV. At WCWP he is making his dreams become a reality. “I’ve played many sports over the span of my life, like soccer, baseball, hockey and track, but my love for hockey tops everything else. Watching hockey I’ve always enjoyed listening to the commentators on TV or the radio and always wondered what it would be like to sit behind the microphone at any sporting event and now I get the chance to do that at WCWP,” Mattina said.
Weinstein has also worked at WCWP for the past year with both Cox and Scavetta, and he feels he is equipped to help Mattina lead the department. “I think the two of us are going to do a great job alongside a great staff; the sky’s the limit to what we can do together,” Weinstein said. In addition to assisting Mattina, Weinstein will also be responsible for training, selection, talent scheduling, and air-checking of all sports related programming.
The WCWP sports department has grown since Mattina’s start almost two years ago, when there were five members. Today, the staff numbers 20. Although they have grown so much in a year and a half, Mattina is not satisfied. One of his goals is to grow even more, and to broadcast every sport. Now, WCWP broadcasts a select amount of sports a semester, including baseball, softball, basketball, football, soccer, volleyball, and lacrosse. Next year, Mattina would like to broadcast rugby and field hockey, which are two sports they have never done before.
“I’ve been in the driver’s seat for a while and now it’s time for them to take control. I left a path here and I don’t want them to follow that path, I want them to lead their own trail, be their own version of sports directors,” Scavetta said.

Former congressman, Steve Israel, chairman of the LIU Global Institute, has written a new novel, “Big Guns,” that will be released by Simon and Schuster on April 17. According to Simon and Schuster, “Steele brings in the big guns of American politics to defeat Lois: political consultants, Super PACs, and celebrities. Soon, thousands of pro-gun and anti-gun partisans descend on Asabogue, along with an assortment of heavily armed right wing militias and the national news media. Bucolic Asabogue becomes a tinderbox.”
“After every act of gun violence the number one question in America is, why doesn’t Congress do something about it? I wanted to tell the story from the inside. The fealty of so many members of Congress to the gun lobby. The gun lobby’s fealty to gun manufacturers. The manufacturers fealty to their profits. The absurd arguments and hypocrisy I witnessed. It’s all in ‘Big Guns,’” Israel said.
The book is intended for “anyone who likes to laugh at the absurdity of some members of Congress, and anyone who wants a satiric behind the scenes view of why Congress does so little about the issue of gun violence,” Israel said.
The recent mass shootings in Parkland, Florida, Las Vegas, and at the Pulse nightclub have sparked a national debate about gun violence. “After finishing my first comic novel about politics, ‘The Global War on Morris,’ I wanted the second to be about the power of the gun lobby,” Israel said. “I wanted to explain from the inside why Congress offers thoughts and prayers but no laws after every shooting. I didn’t have a story until a real life experience broke: when a small city in Georgia responded to a tragic gun shooting at Sandy Hook with the dumbest law I’d ever heard of: requiring citizens to carry guns. I took the premise and brought it to the US Congress. At the time it seemed so absurd. Now it’s almost a presidential talking point. It’s life imitating art imitating life,” Israel said.
This is not the first novel Steve Israel has written. His first book, “The Global War on Morris,” was released on December 30, 2014. Giving people a new sight to the government and their way of thinking, his new book is sure to spark interest in American minds.
“Big Guns” is available for pre-order at Barnes and Noble and on Amazon for $26.

The Northwell Golden Ticket nursing showcase hosted its 10th annual nursing event at the Crest Hollow Country Club on January 19. This event promoted college nursing students who want a future in the Northwell healthcare system, the largest healthcare provider in New York State. Students were offered an opportunity to be interviewed for summer internships. Many who are selected for these internship get hired as a nurse, due to the nationwide shortage of nurses. Approximately 500 students attended the event and 21 college students were picked for the Northwell Award.
Eight LIU Post students won the award, one of them being sophomore Dana Lovino. “The event started with breakfast. We were then led into a ballroom for introductions from the Northwell CEO, where we were congratulated for being the elite in our classes,” Lovino said.
According to Lisa Garcia, an assistant professor for the school of health professions and nursing, in order to receive an award, students must maintain a 3.0 GPA in their fall courses as well as professional conduct in the classroom. “The nominees were then randomly selected by the past Undergraduate Director, Dr. Lilly Mathew, as we received a limited number of tickets from Northwell. We anticipate that Northwell will provide a similar number during the fall 2018 semester and criteria will be similar. We look forward to our students attending the Norwell Health Golden Ticket event in 2019,” Garcia said.

On Thursday night, March 29, LIU Promise and the Take Back the Night committee hosted their third annual Take Back the Night (TBTN). The mission of this event is to end sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual abuse and all other forms of sexual violence. The event was sponsored by several clubs and organizations including the Student Government Association, The Runway, the Black Student Union, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Xi Delta, BASIC, Be The Change, Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Sigma Delta Tau, Theta Chi, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and NYIT, whose students showed up in huge numbers and purchased TBTN t-shirts. The event was held in the Hillwood Commons lecture hall with over 50 students in attendance. This year’s guest speaker was Staceyann Chin, a poet, performing artist and LGBT rights activist. Chin made it clear from the moment that she stepped on the stage that she wasn’t going to just give a speech and send the audience on their way. Chin was born in Jamaica, but now resides in New York. She read multiple poems that she wrote to the audience. The poems discussed her own experience with sexual assault and how she has been able to live life after being assaulted. The students in the audience listened to each word that came out of Chin’s mouth; at one point she even thanked the audience for being so attentive. Chin was able to empower everyone in the room with her reading. She ended with a poem that reminded those who were assaulted that it wasn’t their fault and that they are beautiful.
“I didn’t think I was even going to come to this event earlier, but I’m glad I did or I would’ve been really upset that I missed Staceyann Chin,” Samantha Jones, a senior criminal justice major, said. “She is so empowering and had me feeling like I could one day conquer the world if I had half of her strength.”
Chin told a story about a day when she was proud to be a mother. Chin and her daughter were sharing an elevator with a man and her daughter looked at the man and said “No one is allowed to touch my vagina.” Both Chin and the man were surprised but Chin agreed with her daughter and said “That’s right.” She wants her daughter to know from a very young age that she owns her body, a message she also got across to the audience at Take Back the Night.
“My mom used to tell me every morning before school, that I’m beautiful and shouldn’t let anyone tell me different. I feel like it’s very important to teach your children at a very young age about self-love and the power you have over your own being,” Elizabeth Dunkin, a sophomore English major who attended the event, said.
In addition to Chin, two performers sang on stage about their experiences as victims of assault. The stage was opened for 45 minutes for those who wanted to share their stories; seven students spoke of their battles. After each person spoke, a march to “take back the night” began at Hillwood Commons and went all the way around campus.
“This is my first time at an event like this. I would like to say a huge thank you to those who put this event together, I was able to gain information to not only help myself but also my friends and family members who may end up needing assistance in a situation like this,” Julia Torrez, a a freshman accounting major, said.

Although we may all be excited that spring is finally starting to show its beautiful face, unfortunately it brings with it a fresh, new season of allergies. That’s right: sneezing, hives, watery eyes and brain fog are right around the corner. Luckily, there are a few things that we can do to lessen the blow to our immune system.
The biological allergy sequence is the same in every one of us. According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the immune system (our body’s line of defense against foreign invaders) activates antibodies to attack whatever foreign matter has entered us, better known as an allergen. After one’s first exposure to an allergen, the immune system ‘remembers’ the encounter and will produce triple the amount of antibodies the next time it identifies this allergen in order to protect the body. This is perhaps why allergy victims often have escalating symptoms as the season goes on.
According to studies done by John Hopkins Medical Center, the body elicits reactions not only to bacteria and viruses, but to man made substances such as perfumes, industrial toxins, smoke, and other environmental irritants. As recorded by the Center for Disease Control, pesticides used in agriculture are likely to increase the torment allergy sufferers endure during this time of year. To combat this torment it’s recommended that we eat only organic fruits, vegetables and meats which will help strengthen the gut lining, the place in which 80 percent of the immune system is controlled.
Eating organic foods, exercising, drinking plenty of water, and incorporating a teaspoon of natural raw honey each day are steps that each one of us can take in an effort to steer clear of those nasty allergic symptoms.

Joe Dator, a cartoonist for The New Yorker magazine, shared insights about his work and artistic process with students and professors during common hour on Thursday, March 28. The lunchtime lecture, held in the Life Science building, was sponsored by the political science department. The room was filled to capacity with political science, journalism, art and other majors.
A graduate of the School of Visual Arts, Dator said that he got off to a slow start in the business of drawing cartoons.
“I got out of school, and I was kind of lost and moved away from [cartoons],” Dator said. “In 2005, when I was nearly 40-years-old, it all clicked in my head and it occurred to me that this was what I was supposed to do.”
Dator’s first published cartoon premiered in The New Yorker in August 2006. Since then, he has had many cartoons in the magazine, with some going viral online.
In one of his viral cartoons, Dator illustrated two children playing with toys on a carpet. The caption reads, “What do you want to do when you give up?”
Another of his viral cartoons illustrates a game show called “Facts Don’t Matter!” Three contestants stand across from a judge, and the caption reads, “I’m sorry, Jeannie, your answer was correct, but Kevin shouted his incorrect answer over yours, so he gets the point.” This “Jeopardy” spin-off cartoon, according to Dator, is a direct nod at today’s political climate.
“I made [the cartoon] political because it was so important to what was going on at the time,” Dator said.
Despite trying to continue to make political cartoons in 2016, Dator said he did not have much success in illustrating Donald Trump. “I was making a conscious effort to do cartoons about Trump,” Dator said. “It just wasn’t working. I started reconsidering my role.”
Dator decided that he did not want to add to the conversation surrounding the President. “I started to realize that a lot of comedy about Trump wasn’t really hurting him, it was just putting more Trump out there,” Dator said. “The endless parades of memes from people who think they’re anti-Trump- it’s not working. [Trump] has normal sized hands, and they’re choking the country to death.”
In reexamining his role, Dator said he decided he did not have to make his cartoons political.
“I think I’m doing something good by just putting some dumb joke out there,” Dator said. “Maybe my role is to be a respite from all that.”
Gabrielle Clark, a sophomore political science major, said she enjoyed the explanation Dator offered of his drawing process.“He was really honest about the process of how his works come to be,” Clark said. “I liked the humor in it.”

On Wednesday, April 4, the U.S. Air Force Concert Band will perform at the Tilles Center at 7:30 p.m. with free admission. “We are very excited to host all military bands specifically because we are able to offer performances to the public free of charge,” William Biddle, executive director of Tilles Center, said. “I think it’s a great service that our government is providing throughout all of the United States.”
This will be the second military band the Tilles Center has hosted in 2018. “Military bands love to perform here because of the great acoustics and because they want to perform for the community,” Biddle said.
The concert band consists of 184 members and performs under the leadership of conductor and commander, Colonel Larry H. Lang. Lang has supervised the musicians since March 2012. He equips, trains and deploys the airman musicians. Prior to the U.S. Air Force Concert Band, Lang led the Air Force Band of the Pacific in Alaska, the Air Force Heritage of America Band in Virginia, the Air Force Band of Liberty in Massachusetts, and the Air Force Academy Band in Colorado.
The U.S. Air Force Concert Band is based in Washington, D.C. and is held in the highest regard in the Air Force as a musical ensemble. The band contains six performing groups: Air Force Strings, Airmen of Note, Ceremonial Brass, Concert Band, Max Impact, and Singing Sergeants. The mission of the U.S. Air Force Concert Band is to promote patriotism, honor past and present soldiers, and represent the United States of America.
The Concert Band and Singing Sergeants perform most often of the six performing groups. Both musical ensembles have appeared on national television broadcasts such as their annual holiday ashmob.
The band will perform selections including, “The Chimes of Liberty,” “West Side Story: Maria & Tonight,” “New England Triptych: Chester,” “A Night at the Opera,” and “Proud to Serve: A Patriotic Salute.”
The staff at Tilles Center are looking forward to hosting such an honorable band. “It’s an United States Air Force band which is world-renowned, it’s an honor to present them to our community,” Vanessa Kellogg, assistant director of marketing said.

The Relay for Life committee hosted a drive-in movie event on March 28 in the parking lot of the Pratt Recreation Center. Audience members sat in the comfort of their cars to view “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” the latest installment of the popular franchise. The film’s audio was channeled via WCWP radio so each viewer could listen to the movie without it being loud enough to disturb nearby residents. “They are all sitting in their cars, this way it’s more personal,” Heidi Titko, a senior digital arts major and member of the Relay for Life committee, said.
Titko organized the event, and she was responsible for selling raffle tickets, serving popcorn and ensuring everything ran smoothly throughout the night. The drive-in was one of the events that makes up Relay week, wherein the Relay for Life committee runs several different events throughout the week to raise cancer awareness as well as funds for research and treatment. Other events included the Fight Cancer Fair on Monday, March 25 and the Easter Egg Hunt that took place in Hillwood Commons on March 28. Ticket sales for the upcoming spring ing concert featuring Jeremih will also benefit Relay for Life.
“Relay for Life is a yearly team-based fundraising event that takes place in over 27 countries,” according to the American Cancer Society’s official site. On campus, the event’s opening ceremony will consist of speeches by one caregiver and one cancer survivor from the community. “It’s something people should know about and have respect for,” Titko said.
Movie goers donated $5 to attend the drive-in screening. Relay for Life will take place on April 12 from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. in the Pratt Recre- ation. All students are encouraged to register a team to take part in the event, or donate money to any of the teams already entered. According to Titko, the school’s goal is to raise $50,000, and this goal cannot be reached without the help of the campus-wide community. Students interested in participating can visit www.relayforlife.org/liupost to join. “[Cancer is] something that happens in the real world,” Titko said, “And no one should fight it alone.”

Life in a bustling city and life in a quiet suburb can contrast as harshly as light and darkness. Senior photography major Matthew Gelfman displayed his work at the S.A.L Gallery from March 27-31. Gelfman’s exhibit, “Suburban Boy,” featured 22 black and white photos taken in Flushing, Queens. The Smithtown resident was born in Flushing before moving to Long Island. “This is a picture of where I could have lived, could have grown up,” Gelfman said. Because his parents worked in and grew up in Flushing, he is familiar with the area. “Even though they were the ones that chose to bring me out to suburbia, they still made fun of me and they called me a ‘Suburban Boy,’” he said.
Gelfman uses his artwork to express the culture in Flushing, and the transitions the area has made in recent years. “It shows the evolution, like how an area can just change completely,” he said. However; the show does not have a racial undertone. “Race is irrelevant to me with these pictures, it’s about the emotion of the individual,” Gelfman said.
His subjects include an array of people of various ages and backgrounds. “It’s about each person; they’re on their daily commute, everyone’s just trying to get by. I’m hoping to show all these different people in this world,” Gelfman said. “We are all the same as much as we are different.”
Gelfman selected 22 photos from approximately 5,000 that he took in Flushing to comprise his exhibition. In the future, he hopes to release a book containing 175 of those photos. From this project, he learned about an area that his family grew up in, exploring the different people and faces that now live there.
“It was a great experience, learning about myself,” he said. “It’s sort of an exploration of the people and myself.”

Almost two years since the release of his last album, “Starboy,” The Weeknd released his new extended play (EP) on Friday, March 30. The EP was a surprise to many fans since the artist did not publicly announce he would drop a new album, but some people expected a different kind of music from the singer. “He’s headlining Coachella on April 13 and hasn’t released any new solo music, so it makes sense why he would drop this EP,” Tiffany Paty, a junior finance major, said. “I’m going to Coachella this year, so this just makes me ten times happier, I have new music to listen to,” Paty said.
The Weeknd teased fans on Instagram in February with a post that showed a notebook in front of a microphone. Written on the notebook was “My Dear Melancholy,” the title of the EP.
“My Dear Melancholy” has a similar sound to his debut mixtape, “House of Balloons,” and his second album, “Beauty Behind the Madness.” It has the dark alternative R&B style that he launched his career with.
Unlike his other albums or mixtapes, The Weeknd didn’t seem to care for any of his radio hits or summer anthems such as “Starboy,” “Reminder”, and “The Hills.” His newest album sounds like an open letter to a former lover or two. Fans on Twitter have been speculating about which ex The Weeknd could be talking about; Selena Gomez or Bella Hadid. “He didn’t drop any names; that’s what makes matters worse. When I try to pin it all on Selena, I listen again and think he’s talking about Bella,” Dorothy Jenkins, a sophomore fine arts major, said.
The opening track, “Call Out my Name,” is reminiscent of The Weeknd’s 2015 hit “Earned it” with a slight twist. On this track, he sings about not being able to leave his former lover, even though he knew she was no good for him, but he still wanted her to need him as much as he needed her. The following track is titled, “Try Me,” and The Weeknd sings about wanting his former lover to leave her current partner for him.
The following track “Wasted Times” might have sparked confusion among fans, because the artist speaks about wasted time with the wrong people, but he doesn’t name anyone. The next three tracks discuss a lover that he would rather be casual with and expresses his will to avoid drugs and alcohol after being driven to them by a previous breakup. “The Weeknd is officially back; no more ‘Starboy, The Weeknd’,” James Baburi, a freshman international business major, said.
The six track EP can be found on all streaming services and purchased on iTunes and Google Play.

It’s not hard to spot the athletes on the LIU Post campus. Either they’re carrying their lacrosse sticks, have hair tied up in a wet messy bun or are dressed head to toe in Adidas, with the Pioneers logo imprinted on their chests.
In 2014, Post signed a five season contract with Adidas and a third party vendor, which is a team dealer. Sponsors give the best deals to the schools that get the most exposure on the national level. Athletic Director Debbie DeJong explained the logic behind it. “When it comes to Nike, Under Armor and Adidas, you get better deals depending on who you are university wise,” DeJong said. “What’s the visibility going to be, and one of the biggest visibilities at least at the Division I level is going to be in men’s football and basketball.” It depends on who you are and the success of the athletic body. The more incentive to buy the merchandise, the bigger the contract.
LIU’s contract with Adidas was chosen carefully to help benefit the most amount of people. “Everyone is biased to Nike, Un- der Armour or Adidas but it’s more about what’s the best thing we can get for our en- tire program, and Adidas at that moment was giving us the best money contract back for what was being o ered,” DeJong said. Adidas had the most striking deal for two reasons: they had a better percentage o the actual retail price of clothes, and based on the total amount spent by the depart- ment, student athletes get a rebate to spend at the end of the year.
“This year, we started to take an allotment from the trade that we get back to give any team or individual that competes on the NCAA level gets an adidas shirt with their sport on the front and the NCAA logo on the back,” DeJong said, “so we’ve been able to use those things to help benefit our programs who have made it to the NCAA level.” The rebate money also helps new teams develop, by getting new programs of the ground with apparel, such as women’s rugby who became an approved NCAA team in fall 2017.
Post has approximately 550 student athletes who bene t from the Adidas con- tract. But, DeJong said, it is impossible to make everyone happy. DeJong explained how Adidas is mainly associated with soccer, whereas a sport like lacrosse is more associated with Under Armour. Sophomore political science major and soccer player, Gabby Clark, is more concerned with the delivery of the kit by the third party vendors. “Our gear never gets here on time, or they seem to mess up the order,” she said.
DeJong thinks the athletes deserve a better deal with equipment and attire. “With the amount of exposure we have on the NCAA level, even though we are Division II and also the amount of sports we have, we can get a better deal in the front end,” she said.
For fall 2019, the athletic department is deciding “whether we stay with Adidas or [move to] Nike or Under Armour,” DeJong said. “We will now shop around for the best contact we can get out of it,” she said.
