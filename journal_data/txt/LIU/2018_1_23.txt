The department of music provides multitudes of opportunities for students to hone their skills playing a wide variety of instruments, as well as many networking possibilities with professionals in the industry. Visiting artists including the Shanghai String Quartet and Berta Rojas will hold convocations for students during the spring 2018 semester, and there are other events and showcases lined up for students, faculty, and other attendees outside of the department. “It’s a busy semester, and aside from our usual ensemble concerts, there are a lot of junior and senior recitals, faculty recitals and three festivals,” Lisa Meyer, production and recruitment coordinator, said. Most concerts are free to attend with a valid Post student ID.
Each semester students and faculty strive to expose audiences to as many eras and styles of music as possible. “There’s such a variety of music from contemporary to jazz and classical, so [students will] get
a really good understanding of the different time periods and genres of music,” Meyer said. She hopes those who attend the department’s concerts and convocations will hear something new and want to hear more of it. One opportunity for this is a convocation held by Veronica Nguyen, senior music major, called “A Taste of Vietnamese Music: Building Bridges through Cultural Understanding” on Feb. 12 at 12:30 p.m. in the Hillwood Recital Hall. “She presented her [honors] thesis last semester, and our chair was so impressed that she asked if she would present it again at a convocation,” Meyer said. “Just the level of her caliber of performance and presentation is so outstanding that she wanted the other music majors to see what they should strive for.” Nguyen will perform as well as present a video presentation.
Another chance to for students to possibly hear music from abroad is at the faculty recital presented by the Feigin Duo. They specialize in violin and piano music and are originally from Russia. Music professor Eugene Feigin will perform with his sister Tatiana Feigin on Feb. 6 at 8:15 p.m. More faculty recitals include Victoria Schwartzman, pianist, on Jan. 26 at 5 p.m., and David Holzman, pianist, on Feb. 13 at 8:15 p.m. These performances will take place in the Great Hall and have free admission.
There are several festivals lined up for the season, including the Tilles Choral Festival Concert on March 28 at 7:30 p.m. and the LIU Post Band Festival Concert on April 13 at 8 p.m. These concerts will
be held at the Tilles Center, visit www.tillescenter.org for ticket prices, discounted student tickets are available.
The Long Island Guitar Festival will run April 9-15. This year marks the Guitar Festival’s 26th anniversary. “Some of the world’s greatest artists are coming to the festival,” Harris Becker, director of guitar studies, said. He has worked with director John Mesh to set up concerts and coordinate scheduling for the five-day event. “I try to keep a certain vision of the festival which has to do with high level performance,” he said, “And I’ve been fortunate to get all these guitarists to play.” Attending artists include Berta Rojas, The Newman and Oltman Guitar Duo and Simon Powis. The festival will consist of various concerts, workshops and master classes. “I hope it [teaches] people the versatility of an instrument; the guitar is used in so many different styles in different countries,” Becker said. Many of the duo performances will be held in the intimate chamber setting of the Great Hall, allowing audiences to hear the nuances of the guitar’s various genres of sound. The guitar has incredible versatility, and it enhances the way people can communicate through their onset of expression, according to Becker. Visit www.liu.edu/gfest for further details.
All Post students are welcome to attend these events as well as those in the department’s convocation series that takes place during common hour in the Hillwood Recital Hall. Solo student performances will be held on March 6 and 26. “It’s always a different variety of music, so if people are done with their lunch they can come and enjoy a concert,” Meyer said.

Taraji P. Henson, popularly known for her roles as Cookie Lyon in the hit tv show, “Empire” on FOX and Yvette in the movie “Baby Boy” is now Mary Goodwin in the Sony film, “Proud Mary,” currently playing in all movie theaters. Controversy surrounded the release of the film as SONY’s promotion seemed lackluster. Despite mixed opinions, Henson hyped up the film on her social media accounts. Some audiences were not even aware of the movie until just before its release. “I’m pretty sure this movie isn’t going to resonate well with a lot of people, or it won’t do the numbers [SONY] thought the movie would do when they made Taraji the lead actress,” Taiquasha Williams, a senior criminal justice major, said. “I can’t turn on my tv and see a black woman as the lead person everyday, so SONY knew what they were doing when they casted her.” Henson’s lead role in Empire also attributes to her success, according to Williams. “I only watched the movie because I started seeing commercials two days ago and realized Taraji is in the movie,” she said. 
The film takes place in Boston, where Mary is a professional assassin and is one of the most renowned hitmen in town. She works with Tom (Billy Brown), and together they kill individuals whose lives have been paid for by high class gangs. While on a mission, she realized that one of her victims left behind a 10-year-old son, Danny, and chose to spare his life. She ends up “raising” Danny for a while, and when he gets hurt, she fully adopts him as her own. From that moment on, it is the two of them against the world.
Finding the people who hurt Danny, and annihilating them became her next and final mission. It would get her out of her undesirable lifestyle, and she was determined to escape alive with Danny. Mary wanted a new environment, so she distanced herself from Tom and made the clear choice to abandon her hitman job forever. Danny coming into her life brought out her maternal skills and her human feelings.
“They could have scrapped the whole movie honestly, it was basically an audition tape for Taraji to get future roles in action movies,” June Carter, a junior fine arts major, said.
The movie overall is very underwhelming and a bit confusing. Besides the obvious plot and all the action going on, the movie doesn’t have much to offer viewers. Henson was the highlight of the movie as a black actor in the lead role. She was able to show why she deserved to be cast in the film, but at the same time, the movie lacked a straightforward and interesting plot. The controversy that surrounded the release of the movie did not help the film’s opening weekend success because the movie came in eighth place on Billboard and failed to reach the estimated gross income of $20 million during the first weekend.
Numbers aside, Henson has been able to open doors for more black women to be cast in action movies. Gabrielle Union will play the lead actor role in the upcoming action thriller movie, “Breaking In,” which will be released in theaters on Mother’s Day.
“I’m proud of Taraji and everything she has been able to accomplish. I can’t wait to see what else she has to offer this year with her career,” Motunrayo Olusa, a senior business administration major, said. “I’m not a huge fan of this movie, but I know she will deliver and if not her, she’s been able to inspire a whole new group of black women to go and do roles that they aren’t regularly seen in.”

The bowling team returned to the lanes for the first time since Dec. 1 at the Westchester Community College Invitational at Farmingdale Lanes in Farmingdale, New York on Jan. 21. Bowling, both a fall and spring sport, faced off against a number of teams including Molloy College, Suffolk Community College, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Westchester Community College in the invitational.
Junior biology major Sarah Busse led the Pioneers with a six-game total of 1,080, including a high game of 235 for a 180 average on the day. Freshmen business administration major Patricia Kelly and freshman nursing major Emily Cavanaugh added six-game totals of 1,067 and 1,053 of their own. Freshman clinical lab science major Pamela Penso added a high game of 183, while sophomore special education major Alexis Kosakavich had a high game of 162.
Kelly and Cavanaugh captured second place in the doubles competition, compiling a three-game total of 1,088, while Busse and Kosakavich finished fifth with a total of 1,006.
Busse and Kelly’s success earned the two bowlers a spot on the all- tournament team for the day.
“I definitely think we could have done better,” Kelly said. “We came in second for the day but could have came in first if we picked up a few more spares. Something the team can improve on is our spares — having a good spare game is crucial in our sport, and it is spares that separate the great bowlers from the weak bowlers.”
The bowling team next travels to Altoona, PA on Friday, Jan. 26 to participate in the Red Flash Invitational.

After a successful season last year for LIU Post’s baseball team, with a record of 32-20 and for the first time having a player drafted professionally for Post’s baseball team since 1994, Head Coach Michael Gaffney has high expectations for the team this season, despite the graduation of some of the team’s big guns. Although last year’s roster was more experienced, Coach Gaffney said that there is a lot of talent on this year’s roster, which will make the upcoming season “very interesting.”
The Pioneers will no longer have Dan Jagiello as their closer. Jagiello was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 34th round of the 2017 MLB Draft. Jack DeCarli, who was the starting pitcher for most of his career on the baseball team with a record of 10-3 last season, has also graduated. Gaffney compared DeCarli’s pitching style to Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Kyle Hendricks because Hendricks doesn’t overpower hitters with his fast-ball velocity, [but he just had command on other pitches like his slider, which is a pitch that curves diagonally when thrown but with more velocity than a curveball which curves downward].
Even though those two players are gone, Gaffney is still more than con dent that this year’s team will succeed because they have new talent and veterans with experience winning after a dominant season last year.
This year’s lineup is well rounded; usually the hitters in the lineup who bat after the 6th hitter aren’t as productive offensively, but for this lineup, their hitters at the bottom end of the batting order still pose a threat because of their speed. Gaffney said they will do something as risky as a bunt but will still get on base for an in field hit.
While Gaffney emphasized offense, he is still able to keep his players sharp defensively. Even though the stats say otherwise, accumulating 65 errors last season, it’s because The Pioneer’s home field is grass, so the ball will skip more, while most teams now have incorporated turf fields which makes fielding easier because turf is essentially just carpet.
Looking at last year’s record, The Pioneers were very streaky, meaning they won around five games straight, lost a couple but bounced back and dominated. Gaffney described that as “peaks and valleys.” This season, he wants to extend the peaks and limit the valleys. There was a stretch when the team lost 8 of 12 games, but they were able to come back from that drought together as a team.
Gaffney expects nothing less than the team he coached last year, which means you, can expect a great season again for The Pioneers. Practice began last week and their first game will be Feburary 16 at Limestone College and their first home game is on March 19 against Adelphi.

The Men’s indoor track and field team had a strong performance behind senior health science major Stefan Adams’ first place 400-meter dash finish at the 36th Yale Intercollegiate Track Classic at the Coxe Cage on Jan. 13.
Adams, of Jamaica, New York, finished with a time of 49.53 seconds in the 400-meter to earn the win while adding a second-place finish with a 22.24 second time in the 200-meter dash. Freshman undecided student Jaelin Hood, of Freeport, participated in the same events, placing third in the 200-meter at 22.87 seconds and fourth in the 400-meter with a 51.26 second finish. Freshman undecided student Jahmel Johnson, of Haverstraw, took fifth place in the 60-meter dash at 7.08 seconds.
Junior Angelo Fradelakis, of Patchogue and sophomore forensic science major Twary McKenzie, of Huntington, led the Pioneer field athletes with two top-five finishes. Fradelakis earned third place in the weight throw with a 12.68-meter toss, while McKenzie came in fifth in the triple jump with a distance of 12.53 meters.
”The 400-meter is my main event, so it felt pretty routine as far as the win and time ran,” said Adams. “As far as the 200-meter, [there] is always room to improve.”

The women’s swim team got back in the pool to compete for the first time since before the winter break on Jan. 11 against Siena College. Statically, Post is the better team record wise with a record of 3-1 while Siena College’s was 2-3, so, how would that affect their performance?
Team member Elizabeth Law, a sophomore physics and math major from Chester Springs, PA, was surprised by her performance in the meet. “I did a lot better than I expected,” she said. Law achieved her best times in the 200 freestyle with a time of 2:01.41 and finishing the 100-yard butterfly in 1:00.85. “On paper, it may seem like an easy win but that does not mean it’s going to be one in reality. We still have to put our full effort into the race,” Law said.
Jessica Argelander, a sophomore childhood education major from La Verne, California, has been a member of the swim team for two years said, “ The break was much needed and I think we all came back feeling better and more energized,” she said. Argelander swam the 50 freestyle in 25.94, the 100 freestyle in 56.20 and the last leg of the 200 medley in 25.02 relay. Argelander felt more confident during going into the meet, “ We could focus on just having fun and swimming fast. We swim faster and better when we’re having fun, plus it was our home pool” she said.
So, The Pioneers were more than ready to get back in the pool, even after a short break. The Pioneers beat Siena College, 123-79, moving their record to 4-1.
