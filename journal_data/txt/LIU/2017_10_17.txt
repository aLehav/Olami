At 11:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 17, the office of Public Safety sent an announcement via email and text message notifying students and faculty that the library would be closed for two days. According to the notice, “the library will be closed effective immediately and will reopen Thursday, Oct. 19 at 12 noon. Efforts are being made to relocate the afternoon and evening classes that were scheduled in the library to other campus buildings. Class relocations will be posted at the library’s entrance. Updates will be emailed through LIU email.” The notification did not state the reason for the closing of the library.
In response to the Pioneer’s inquiries, Head of Public Safety Michael Fevola stated in an email that the library was closed because of wasp infestation. “LIU Post Facilities Staff and a contracted exterminator located a bee’s nest in the attic of the library and took immediate action to eradicate the nest and protect the health and safety of the public. The exterminator began professional treatment to remove the nest and treat the building. The treatment requires that the building is vacated for 48 hours.”
Faculty members with offices in the library were unexpectedly displaced due to the library’s unplanned closing. Classes were reassigned to rooms in different buildings. The Information Technology department was temporarily moved to the Browse store in Hillwood Commons. IT has “spread over what available space we have; they are utilizing the work room and the desk they already have for daily use. So far we’ve adjusted pretty nicely,” Albert Donor, a senior broadcasting major and Browse store associate, said.
Shaireen Rasheed, a professor of education, was the last professor to leave her office when she got word of the library’s wasp infestation. “I just took everything out of my office that I need for the next two days,” she said. “I’m trying to make a makeshift office wherever I can find wifi.” Rasheed has office hours set up for students to visit, she’s been holding meetings in Hillwood Commons. She had to post-pone a Skype meeting due to the lack of privacy available. Rasheed had just enough notice to remove her important belongings from the library so that her work has not been adversely affected by her removal from her office.
According to Fevola, rooms are reserved in Hillwood Commons for students to use as quiet study and computer space. Students who have questions regarding their classroom location may contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299- 2800.
Although the original notification informed students that the library would reopen at noon on Friday, Oct. 20, students did not receive a notice that the library had reopened until 2:13 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 20. The notice sent by Public Safety via the LIU Alert email system, stated that the library had reopened, thanked the community for its patience, and informed students and faculty that the library had resumed normal operating hours.
During this three and a half day library closure, students had to find other places to study, have internet access, and print out work. They were unable to take out books or use the library’s reference services, other than by email. Dean of Students Michael Berthel informed students by email that the library maintained virtual reference services to answer reference, catalog, and database questions via post-ref@liu.edu.
“The library faculty did a great job maintaining the online chat reference and email reference services,” Thomas Walker, associate dean of the college of education, information, and technology, and director of the Palmer school of library and information science, said. 


Students received no further notifications regarding the measures taken to remove the bees.

“Additional precautionary measures were put in place to ensure the continued safety of the community,” Berthel said.

The TV studio in the Department of Communications and Film acquired 1o new Sony NX cameras over the summer. Katherine Dalton, coordinator of the television center and an adjunct professor of electronic media, purchased the cameras from B&H to replace the older cameras that were damaged and outdated.
The new cameras offer better picture quality, longer battery, HD display screen and more adjustable settings. Some of the new settings allow control over the pitch and sound of the internal or external microphone, and are able to go over 1080p. The newer model also comes with more external customization features, giving more options for external microphones, grips, lights and other accessories. Each camera cost $1,700. Dalton stated they plan to buy another eight cameras to replace additional older ones.
The cameras are used for broadcasting classes as well as PTV productions. Students are able to borrow the cameras for class projects and or for personal use with permission. Students borrowing the cameras sign them out from the TV studio in Humanities Hall, and pay a $10 late fee if not returned at the agreed upon time.
Alexandra Sanchez, a broadcasting major who has worked in the TV studio for two semesters, is pleased with the new equipment. “The new cameras are bigger and have way more features than the older ones, making the transition a little difficult, but the difference in video quality makes it worth it. [They] feel more professional,” she said.
The only con with the new cameras are their size. The bulkiness and added weight of the new cameras compared to the older versions, make them heavier and harder to carry around. The size and weight, however, is to be expected with the additional new features.

On Thursday, Oct. 5, during common hour, students gathered to fill their stomachs as well as their minds. Students met with assistant managing editor of Newsday, Maryann Skinner, and human resources professional, Beth Repeta. The experienced professionals provided students with skills from an employer’s perspective, giving insights on the do’s and don’ts of resume writing and interviewing.
Students held onto every word the professionals said; first learning that the purpose of a resume is to present oneself in the best way possible to the employer. Skinner and Repeta told students that before creating a resume, first think about the job that they currently have and to connect it to the job that they see themselves having in the future. The resume is a concentrated description of past and present work experiences; it displays what makes them different to the potential employer.
“Make sure you give the complete package,” Skinner said. A resume should separate one from others applying for the same position. In order to do so it is important to stand out in the first few sentences. Use action words and describe previous work experience thoroughly. “It’s helpful to show the employer what you know,” Repeta said. A bad resume can be the cause of not getting the interview.
Employers are busy and have countless applicants each day. Skinner and Repeta experience this first hand with interviewees, and talked about how they separate the good from the bad. When it comes to interviewing, they told students that researching the company is vital. It is important to know what the company is about and “to show what you know about the company during the interview,” according to Skinner. “Have a good summary of what it is that we do. Practice and prepare,” Repeta said. She then explained how to dress professionally for men and women. It is safe for men to wear slacks, a collared shirt, and shoes, while it is safer for females to overdress and wear a dress. “I find it that females often underdress,” Skinner said.
Skinner advised students to show up to an interview 10-15 minutes ahead of the scheduled time and no earlier or later than that. Showing up early looks like you are eager and are serious about the position you are applying for and also gives you time to fill out paperwork and focus before walking into the interview, said Skinner. “Give a firm handshake and look your potential employer in the eye,” Repeta said. “In the interview be confident, speak clearly, and don’t fidget.”
The interview is not only an opportunity for the employer to learn about the interviewee, but for the interviewee to learn about the employer. “It’s okay to bring questions,” explained Repeta. She suggested asking questions like, ‘what does it take to be successful in your company?’ And, ‘how did others in the company succeed?’ Not only is it useful to ask questions, but it is also wise to be prepared to answer questions. Employers will often ask questions such as: how are you under stress? And where do you see yourself in 5 years? Use your opportunity wisely because the interview has the power to change your career status in a matter of minutes.
What one does after the interview is just as important as what one does during the interview. What helps potential employees stand out from the rest is following up with the company, and thanking them for the opportunity. “I find it nice when applicants follow up with me after the interview and I remember that person,” Skinner said. If the applicant does not hear from the employer, it is acceptable to reach out to the company asking for an update on the status of their application.
Lastly, both speakers told students that social media can have a major impact on the employer’s decision about an applicant’s application. Have a LinkedIn and present yourself in a good light on all social media platforms. Also, having an online portfolio is an important factor employers take into consideration.“If you are working in journalism, you have to be careful about what you post. It must be unbiased,” Repeta said. Be careful of what you post on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram because it could cost you a job.
Having professionals come and talk to students was an enlightening moment for many. Students were able to see where they could potentially go. Many mistakenly overlook the fundamentals of a resume and interviewing, but without being taught how to go about these things correctly, there is no job, there is no career, and there is no success. Students were able to have Skinner and Repeta review their resumes and make suggestions following the workshop.

Twenty eight teams of 140 students raised $312 at a charity dodgeball tournament ran by nine Post Foundations classes in the Pratt Center gymnasium on Thursday, Oct. 5. The nine Post Foundations classes of 20 students each volunteered to run the event, along with the nine peer mentor students who help teach the classes.
Nicole Guillet, a junior education major and peer mentor was one of the nine mentors who helped organized the event. “We had a great turn out – over 25 teams ranging from the Delta Zeta sorority, to lacrosse, football, basketball, and swimming [teams], to game design majors and everyone in between,” Guillet said. “The proceeds are going to Inclusive Sports and Fitness, a gym [in Bayport, New York] that specializes in recreational and athletic activities for kids with disabilities.”
The dodgeball fundraiser was the Post Foundation’s student service learning project for their classes. The event also connected them to this year’s common read, “Look Me in the Eye,” by John Elder Robison. “Look Me in the Eye” is a memoir that chronicles the author’s life with Asperger’s syndrome. The students chose to donate the money they raised to Inclusive Sports and Fitness to benefit kids facing the same struggles the author faced. “It was satisfying to see everyone come together from such different and diverse groups and have fun for a great cause,” Mike Licata, a junior health science major and one of the participating peer mentors, said.
Another participating peer mentor, Samantha Lool, a sophomore health science major, agreed. “The dodgeball tournament brought together so many people from campus and I feel like our freshmen students definitely got a taste of what the LIU Post community is like,” she said.
Danielle Haye, a freshman biology major, is in one of the Post Foundations classes that participated in running the event. “It was really good to meet new people [and] have fun in a setting outside of class. I got to meet other freshmen and that was cool,” Haye said. Melissa Lysse, a sophomore education major, also attended the event. “The dodgeball tournament was fun to watch; it was satisfying to see the different groups come together, compete, and create memories,” Lysse said.
The peer mentors hope to organize another charity dodgeball event next year; this was the first year they held this fundraiser. To learn more about Inclusive Sports and Fitness, visit www.inclusivesportsandfitness.org.

The Student Activities Board, a student lead organization under Campus Life, put together a week of school spirit themed events to prepare for Homecoming.
On Tuesday, Oct. 10, to begin the spirit week, members of SAB handed out green and gold “Spirit Shakes” in the lobby of Hillwood Commons during common hour. Students were able to grab their free shakes along with green and gold bead necklaces for the homecoming football game.

On Wednesday, Oct. 11, SAB hosted its annual color wars event on Riggs Lawn at 6 p.m. Students received free white homecoming t-shirts and green and gold powdered paint to throw at each other. Despite the rain in the middle of the event, students still enjoyed it. “We need more events like this. After a long week of classes, SAB came to the rescue for me,” Coivan Makia, a junior business administration major, said.
The third event of the week was a BBQ on Riggs Lawn on Thursday, Oct. 12. Free food and more homecoming t-shirts were handed out to students, and students were reminded and encouraged to attend the pep rally the following night. On Friday, Oct. 13, SAB hosted a pep rally that offered raffles and games with $30,000 in prizes.
“The pep rally gives everyone a chance to have school spirit and [feel] united,” Novaera Mumnoon, a freshman biomedical science major, and member of SAB, said.
Not everyone thought the pep rally was uniting. “The events were unfair,” Anthony Cavaretta, a freshman broadcasting major, said. “All the prizes went to the athletes because they were chosen to do all the activities,” he said. The pep rally lasted just an hour, yet some students departed early. A carnival kicked off Homecoming on Saturday, Oct. 14, in the parking lot of Pratt Recreation Center from 11:30 a.m. until the start of the game at 1 p.m. The carnival, which had games, rides, food trucks, and merchandise stands, was all open to the whole community. Alumni returned and joined the festivities, including tailgating, before the big game. Hundreds of people attended the carnival, enjoying the various rides and games.
The Student Activities Board holds general staff meetings, which are open to all students, every other Monday during common hour. During these meetings, students can offer suggestions for events on campus. These ideas are taken back to the e-board meetings every Monday for discussion and approval. Students interested in joining SAB can show up to a general meeting, or email Vice President Sarah Fiore at Sarah.Fiore@my.liu.edu.

Professor of Education Shaireen Rasheed published an article titled, “Charlottesville and the Myth of the Neutral Classroom: Racial Literacy in the Age of Trump,” in The Huffington Post on August 18.
In the article, Rasheed expressed her concern for the future of America after the white supremacist march and violence that erupted in Charlottesville, VA in August. Rasheed was interviewed by The New York Times about whether she would be contributing the content of her article into her curriculum this year.
Rasheed, who has been at LIU Post for 17 years, teaches the social, philosophical and historical foundations of education, and multiculturalism. Rasheed and Wendy Ryden, a professor in the English department, linked their English and education courses together to teach students how to create pedagogies of resistance this semester, but have been collaborating for a few years now. The course is offered each semester to undergraduate students.
“We created a learning community a few years back that was very exciting and have been looking for an opportunity to do so again, in which students from different classes benefit from interacting with each other and learning about each other’s’ viewpoints,” Ryden said. “In my World Literature class that is paired with Professor Rasheed’s education class, we learn about the literature of european [culture] and other cultures in order to see differences and overlaps in perspectives,” she continued.
Many college students are fearful after the Charlottesville protests and counter protests that led to the vehicular manslaughter of Heather Heyer. “I heard what happened and honestly I’ve never felt so uncomfortable and scared,” Inal Williams, a senior forensic psychology major, said. “My sister goes to the school that [the protesters] walked on and I cried for hours and hours hoping that she wasn’t hurt or touched,” she said.
In her course, Rasheed aids students in realizing what their roles in society are when it comes to speaking out for those who don’t have a voice and cannot take action for themselves. Rasheed encourages other professors to bring these conversations into the classroom. In her own classroom, Rasheed asked students which roles they played in society. Understanding this role, she said, is important to the advancement and progression of society. “As teachers we have to use the purpose of education to make and shape the best students inside and outside of the classroom,” Rasheed said. “Privilege and race are very important to discuss; we can’t just ignore these topics like they aren’t relevant in today’s society.”
Through bringing the conversation of Charlottesville, and also the Black Lives Matter movement to the classroom, Rasheed has kept students informed and engaged. “I teach masters classes, doctorate classes and also undergraduate students, but the freshmen are my favorite because most of them don’t have the tools to be informed and I’m able to help students who actually want to learn,” Rasheed said. She advised students to keep their hearts and minds open.
Michael Palumbo, a former student in Rasheed’s EDI 14 class, believed that she was a model professor. “[She] always showed me the right path. Even if I was slipping in my ideas, she supported me all the way,” Palumbo said.
“[The EDI 14 course] opened my mind up to a lot of new ideas and conflicts that people have to face that I never had to,” Taylor Laporta, a sophomore childhood education major, said. “[I] realized that the education system has been oppressing students. Her class gave me so much con dence in myself,” she continued.
Not every student was accepting of the curriculum at first. Rasheed had a student who was very resistant when they first met. “A student of mine was particularly resistant to discussing LGBTQIA issues in the classroom. So when a group of my students as part of their final project staged a play based on Mathew Shepard’s story called the “The Laramie Project,” I requested that he be part of it. After the semester was over he emailed me appreciative of the opportunity to be part of staging the “Laramie Project,” as it made him confront his own biases and deconstruct them in a way he that hadn’t experienced before. Making him aware of the importance of being an ally and creating alliances across different groups.”
“Unfortunately, classrooms continue to reinforce a multicultural framework of tolerance, where teachers often are hesitant to condemn issues of racism, sexism and xenophobia,” Rasheed wrote in her Huffington Post article. Rasheed explained that creating a common ground or space for students to be educated and informed has been her secret ingredient when covering controversial topics.
“One of the things she communicated to our class is that it’s important to create environments that accept all different types of people,” Nicole Guillet, a senior English education major, said. “The classroom is supposed to be a safe space, so as teachers, you have to be advocates for the students who might not have one,” she continued.
Every semester before dropping her daughter off at college, Rasheed reminds her to “be authentic.” She advises her Post students to do the same, sharing the mindset she learned from her mentor, Nel Noddings, while studying at Columbia University.
Noddings will give a lecture in the Tilles Center on Thursday, Nov. 9, on “Teaching Controversial Issues.” The College of Education, Information and Technology will host the two- hour event, which begins at 12 p.m. Students and faculty are welcome to attend the free event but must RSVP with Anastasia Karathanasis by email at Anastasia.Karathanasis@liu.edu.

How many of us feel rundown and exhausted at one point or another during the week? It could be recurrent exhaustion upon waking, a mid-day low point, or the inability to recover after a workout. If this sounds like you on a regular basis, you might be experiencing adrenal fatigue.
The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and are responsible for secreting a variety of hormones that respond to all types of stress. Anything that stimulates the body, whether it’s a re alarm, a breakup, a marriage proposal, or even a scary movie, the adrenals are responsible for handling all things ‘stressful’. Since symptoms range from depression and weakness to hyperactivity and muscle cramps, it’s often difficult to pinpoint an adrenal fatigue issue which is why it’s important to find a doctor who’s very familiar with the adrenal glands and knows what tests to order.
Before seeking professional help, you can try to analyze your lifestyle and see if you’re experiencing some of the telltale symptoms that present themselves when a person is suffering from adrenal fatigue. In addition to those mentioned above, another common sign you’re burnt out is craving carbohydrates, sugar and caffeine throughout the day.
Studies done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, show that stimulants in general, including drugs, alcohol, sugar, caffeine, and even things that ‘pump us up’ such as loud music and suspenseful situations, have all been linked to spikes in blood pressure, increase in blood sugar, long lasting feelings of angst, and even muscle weakness. The common denominator seems to be the adrenal glands and the effects of hormones that are produced in times of prolonged and extensive stress.
If you want to avoid the symptoms associated with adrenal burnout, or just feel that you need to relax a bit more, aside from going to the doctor, there are a few natural ways that you can cool down. One includes, oddly enough, going a bit easier at the gym and being sure not to push your body to its max. When you do this, all of your energy is put into whatever exercise being performed, and is being taken away from other parts of the body that could help you maintain proper energy and fight fatigue. You could also try taking up yoga, changing around your weekly schedule so you have more free time, or try confronting your feelings and stop holding in negative thoughts and emotions. Anger, worry, jealousy and fear leave the body feeling weak, confused and drained and are best to be avoided. In a world with so much bad and negativity buzzing around us, it’s important to make sure that we are treating ourselves and our bodies with respect.

Hurricane season took many by surprise this year when Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria hit. Islands like Puerto Rico and Barbuda fell victim to this year’s hurricanes. The hurricanes touched parts of the Caribbean, North America, and even Cuba. Red Cross, Unicef, Tidal, and many other relief groups have come together to raise money and gather food and supplies that will be sent to the countries and islands affected by the natural disaster. While it was hurricane season for some places, Mexico city, California and other places were being affected by earthquakes. The Black Student Union and Runway are coming together to throw a Halloween Social on Oct. 27 to raise money for the hurricane victims.
“I chose to collaborate with the Runway club because they have expressed mutual feelings when it came to raising aid for the victims. We chose to raise money for Puerto Rico because it was the most recent event that happened and many of our members across both clubs have family that were affected by the earthquake,” Motun Olusa, president of the BSU club said.
Jay-Z used his platform, Tidal, to get music lovers and many who were concerned to come out and donate supplies, food and anything they believed would be useful. First he hosted a free Vic Mensa concert which in order for you to attend you had to bring either school supplies, toiletries, diapers, and other supplies that they knew would be of use to those in Puerto Rico.
“I’m a huge fan of Vic Mensa so when I heard he was having a concert, I immediately became ecstatic but to find out it was free and that he would be helping my homeland, Puerto Rico just made things ten times better. I donated nonperishable foods, some school supplies and some clothes I no longer need,” Kenan Browder, a sophomore art major said. Tidal also sent a private plane over to Puerto Rico with supplies and aid on Oct. 5.
“We’re hoping for a great turnout, all are welcome, donations of food and clothes will be accepted. Tickets will be sold and a portion of the proceeds will go towards hurricane relief efforts for Puerto Rico,” Keolani Williams, president of the Runway said. The event will take place on Oct. 27th, from 7p.m. till midnight. Tickets will be sold as follows, one for five dollars and two for seven dollars.

Anyone who knows Sarah Anthony, a sophomore psychology major, knows she is obsessed with her dog, Mango. Now we know why.
Mango, who just turned 11 on Oct. 4, is a white, fluffy maltese with hair that is kept short, especially around the ears, and “a tongue that is way too big for his mouth, so it always hangs out.” The only pet in his house, he lives on a cul-de-sac in New Jersey with the Anthony family.
Originally from St. Louis, Mango has lived a lavish life ever since he was own east. This “sassy” maltese has a strong personality, according to Sarah, who says that he is also “judgmental” and “has his own set of ways.”
Mango’s favorite things to do are urinating on his bed when he’s mad at his family, taking short walks, and getting dressed up and having photos taken of him. He goes to the groomer once a week, and has a photo session each time.
Mango gets upset with Sarah for living on campus and misses her while she is away each semester. He tends to go into her bedroom while she is away and proceed to carry the garbage he finds throughout the house. If Sarah could have one conversation with her dog, she said that she would confront him about his hostility towards her.
However, when the two are together, Sarah’s favorite thing to do with him is “play tag.”
However, he comes to as many field hockey games as he can with Sarah’s mom, Doris, who brings him in a travel purse. He is a big fan of LIU Post and wears his green and gold scarf to the weekend games.
For funny pictures and updates on Mango’s life, follow him on Instagram @mango_mangs !

We react in many different ways during an emergency. It is almost as if a different side of you comes out to handle the situation; you never know how you are going to react until you are in that moment. Many people go into a state of nervousness and freeze up, while others take control and do what has to be done to survive.
Ram Singal, a survivor of September 11, 2001, spoke on campus in the Tilles Patron Lounge on Oct. 12. His talk was sponsored by the Coalition for Conservation and Be the Change club.
Singal has spoken around the world about the important message of taking care of your mind and spreading positive thoughts.
On Sept. 11, when Singal was in the first tower that was hit, a state of calm washed over him and his only goal was to save others. As the panic and chaos around him became so real, he started to wonder why he had not feared anything. He connected his calmness to the fact that he had been practicing meditation for 27 years.
By focusing on yourself and treating your body right, you can control how you handle difficult situations. Singal said during a speech in 2008, “Everyone else speaks of 9/11 as an experience of horror. I saw it as a tale of faith, of conviction, of doing well in life.” Singal uses his experience as a way to enlighten others and show them that you can take a traumatic experience and still find the positive in your life.
Controlling your actions when your feelings become so powerful can help a lot. It takes time and practice, but the outcome can be incredible. For Singal, practicing meditation for so many years helped him in a horrifying situation. Instead of feeling terrified or helpless, he took action and stayed calm.
Focusing on mental health and feeding your mind positive thoughts can have a huge impact on your day-to- day life. If you would like to take up meditation there are classes being held every Monday since October 2nd from 1-1:40 pm in room TF 101 in the Theatre, Dance and Arts Management building here on campus. There is no registration you can just show up.
Having these small meetings to clear your mind and control your thoughts can have a huge impact on you life. Go out of your comfort zone and give it a shot!

On Oct. 11, a poetry reading led by poets Matt Pasca and Terri Muuss was held in the Great Hall. Both writers have published compilations of original poetry and are educators; Muuss works as a life coach, motivational speaker, social worker, director, and performer as well. Their compilations, “Over Exposed,” “A Thousand Doors,” and “Raven Wire” are available for purchase on www.amazon.com. Muuss is currently working to publish her next work, “God’s Spine.”
Being a married couple and familiar with each other’s style of writing, Pasca and Muuss took turns reading and performing pieces in tandem. “We like to see how our poems dialogue together,” Muuss said. The pair also offered writing advice to the audience of approximately 40 attendees, underlining the prospect of finding inspiration. The couple finds much of theirs in family, life experiences and by having visited numerous countries worldwide including Mexico, Central America, Guatemala, Honduras, Greece and Turkey. “Writing is a process of discovery. It’s not a process of transcription,” Pasca said.
Many of the poems Muuss read stemmed from the inspiration of relatives and past trauma; Muuss performed a poem titled “T-Shirt,” that she had written from the perspective of her autistic son. The piece emphasized the different thought processes her son experiences from the rest of the world and explored that mode of thinking. “I was very drawn to Terri Muuss’s poems,” Michaela Fox, sophomore musical theatre major, said, “They embarked into a world that is more violent, more abusive, more aggressive; it’s discomforting for a lot of people but it’s necessary to talk about.”
Pasca’s poetry had more visually descriptive aspects. His poem “The Exact Location of Africa,” depicted an illustration of Mount Kilimanjaro. At the same time, the piece confronted issues of race and cultural ignorance. “What better way to discuss things that make us uncomfortable than through art?” Fox said. Many of the writers’ poems addressed contemporary issues that have existed for centuries.
Muuss’s biggest piece of advice for students interested in writing is to, “Find someone who wants your work to be its best.” The writer is not always the best judge of their own work, according to both Muuss and Pasca. “Not everybody is going to be a good reader for your work,” Muuss said, supporting the idea that everyone has a writing style unique to them.
Dennis Pahl, English professor and current director of the poetry center, said, “I’ve never seen before, a better back and forth exchange of poetry, performance and passion.”

Television personalities Brad Garrett and Rita Rudner will be performing at the Tilles Center on Thursday, Oct. 26. Be prepared to have a night full of laughs with the “queen of snappy one-liners” and the co-star brother from “Everybody Loves Raymond.” Together for one night, these to comics pack a mean set of laughs. Musical group Alibi will open the night with a pre-show concert in the Tilles atrium. The band has a New Orleans style of music that pulls from different genres such as rock, pop, jazz and swing to create their own unique sound.
Brad Garrett has won three Emmy awards and a Screen Actors Guild award for his role in “Everybody Loves Raymond” as the lovable brother Robert. Garrett’s widely-recognizable voice can be heard in over thirty animated movies including “Finding Nemo,” “Ratatouille” and “A Bug’s Life.” His stand-up career has spanned over thirty years; he was one of the youngest comics to appear in “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson” and has performed on Broadway. Recently he opened his own comedy club at MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
“With all that’s going on in society, it’s nice to come together to share a laugh,” director of communications and engagement at the Tilles Center, Shari Linker, said.
Rita Rudner had a different rise to fame. At fteen years old she moved to New York to dance on Broadway, and she has appeared in several musicals including original productions of “Follies”. She developed her trademark style of punch lines in the early eighties. And she was a frequent guest on both “The Late Night with Letterman” and “The Tonight Show.” Her first HBO special, “Rita Rudner One Night Stand,” was nominated for several awards.
“I would definitely be interested in going. Comedy is one of my favorite genres,” Ilana Leviton, junior psychology major, said. The show starts at 7:30 p.m., with discount tickets available to both staff and students.

From Oct. 10 to Oct. 14 the Student Art League (SAL) Gallery located on the first oor of the library presented artwork by graduate MA art student, Meghan Hallock. Hallock displayed 38 ceramic and eight screenprint works to the community with a reception held on Wednesday, Oct. 11 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.
The theme of her showcase was “Blue.” The color is associated with universal emotions and feelings. In Hallock’s vision, blue is like the sky and the ocean, which is connected to stability and truth. “It is something that is very personal,” Hallock said. “But also something we all can identify with.”
Primarily using clay as her medium, Hallock was drawn to screen print because it complimented her detailed and meticulous personality. The screenprints were of colonial-style buildings and homes. Hallock called them “blueprints,” and they represent homesickness and longing for the familiar. “The grays and the blues represent melancholy, the pops of color represent the joy and happiness you get from being home and in that comfort,” Hallock said.
Clay has always been a medium of “continuity and fragility” in Hallock’s mind. She works with porcelain for its “freshness, delicacy, and strength,” which are qualities she finds within herself. “[The waves] are all original and each have their own meaning to them,” Julia LiPuma, a cousin to Hallock, said. The handbuilt and wheel-thrown ceramics took various forms of a wave that embodied emotions ranging from ecstasy to grief, weakness and power.
Currently an elementary art teacher at Port Jefferson Elementary School, Hallock plans to keep producing work that inspires and connects with everyone.

Emily Halper, a junior art education major from Commack, NY is currently spending a semester in Florence, Italy and will be returning in December after departing on Aug. 31. “There’s so much inspiration,” Halper said. She found inspiration in pieces of art at the Uffizi art gallery that most people only see in textbooks. She believes her work to be constantly improving as she spends time abroad, “I think every time I lift a pen or paintbrush I’m learning because it’s really all practice,” she said.
Halper has been learning silk screening and printmaking, processes that deviate from her usual style of work of sketching and painting. Halper is studying at the Florence School of Fine Arts with an intimate class of only eight students. Her favorite piece of her most recent works is a relatively large oil painting of drapery. “I honestly can’t believe I did it. It’s almost three feet by four feet,” Halper said, “It was only my second attempt at oil painting.” The piece took 30 hours to complete.
“With millennials, there’s a lot more contemporary art,” Halper said, “Regarding contemporary art, many people have a ‘been there, done that’ sort of way of thinking because there is always an issue of originality, and with contemporary art, we try to break this barrier of normality.”

“It never gets old, its great to see everyone again,” said Jeff Kroll, who graduated in 1975. Every year for the past 40 years, alumni that graduated from the early 1960’s to May of 2016, have come back to WCWP to do live broadcasts for all of homecoming weekend.
There are around 3 dozen alumni that are on air throughout the course of the weekend. Of the original seven that started the tradition, they all live in six different states.
Jeff Kroll who not only participates in this weekend but is also a key player in the sports department throughout the year as well  explains that, “All the alumni that come back to do this broadcast have earned it.”
Alumni Joel Feltman, who graduated in 1974, explained, “suddenly it all comes back to you, there’s some sort of magic in the air when coming back to station every year.” Joel this weekends events travels from Florida away from his home to come just for this weekend because he enjoys doing it so much. Back when Joel was a student, there was only one studio in the radio station.
There was a barbeque on Saturday Oct. 14 after the victory of the Pioneers homecoming game when they beat Southern Connecticut State University 52-35. Students who are currently enrolled in classes were able to attend the barbeque as well as all of the alumni who were there to broadcast that weekend. Students past and present interacted with each other all weekend and newer students got to learn a few things from the alumni.
The broadcast was from noon on Friday Oct. 13, until Sunday, Oct. 15 at midnight. “[It] Turned out just the way we hoped, the station is a home to all the alumni and it was a lot of fun broadcasting with people we all call friends and family here at WCWP,” Jeff Kroll said, to mark the end of the broadcast for homecoming weekend.
*Editors Note: Andrew Servedio is part of the radio station at WCWP.

The women’s basketball is on the eve of a new season and its members are looking forward to giving their all as they play on the court on Saturday, Nov. 11 against Adelphi University.
Last season, the Pioneer women were 7-11 in the East Coast Conference, but they are expecting to turn that record around with wins in the 2017-18 season. The team takes last season’s record as a springboard to move forward as they are motivated to give their all in future games.
The ultimate goal is to compete in the ECC Championship and take home the win. However, the team members understand that they must make changes before getting to that point.
This season, the team can be more alert offensively and get more quality looks at the basket. The women’s basketball coach, Deirdre Moore, said the team’s goal for this season is to, “show an improvement in the way we play that we hope will be reflected in more wins.” Reflecting on last season, Coach Moore is confident that her team could have easily had a better record. “I can pick several games where we could have been 11-7,” she said.
The group has diligently worked during the off-season, which will hopefully shine through in forthcoming games. “Stay focused on defense and then offense will come!” Coach Moore says to her team. Keeping that same mindset, she believes that the team can and will be more competitive in the ECC this season.
The squad this year has brought back an impressive work ethic and great attitude that will only help their success. “Players want to be here and play their full potential,” Coach Moore said. Senior Kristen Olsen, captain and guard, leads defensively and communicates consistently with her teammates on the floor. When Olsen is on the floor during a game, you will hear her fighting for her team and giving direction.
During the 2016-17 season, Olsen started in 27 of 28 games and had eighty-five in free throws, the most in the team. Olsen also had the second most assists for the team and made 44 three-point eld goals. The seasoned player values teamwork and acknowledges the team’s growth. “I feel like we’re the same team but better, with more weapons and have better chemistry this year, ” Olsen said.
This season, look out for incoming freshmen Natalie Hickman, who plays forward, and Patrice Harding, who is guard. “They have some good incoming freshmen this year and should have more depth in the front court behind sophomore guard Mikaiya Moore and Sasha Patterson junior forward,” Thomas Scavetta, WCWP sports director, said. Coach Moore is excited for what they will bring to the court and to debut their new talent. “This season both Natalie Hickman and Patrice Harding are willing to do whatever they can to help the team be successful, ” Moore said.
The team as a whole is eager and is ready to face its competitors. “I’m very excited, I think we have a lot of potential and I honestly think we will be the team that other teams are going to be scared to play,” Kylie Garret, senior guard, said.
With the great efforts of the players and their willingness to consistently make forward movement, the team will be one to reckon with in the ECC. “The team is moving in a positive direction. We believe we have made improvements to compete in the East Coast Conference and the players are consistent in their desire to play together and be eligible for post season play,” Coach Moore said.
Last season, the team had a younger group but this year brings development, experience and more confidence. “Focus and determination. They want to be successful and are putting in hard work to be just that,” Moore said. It may be a new season, but LIU Post women’s basketball is bringing forth pressure; pressure on the court, defensively and offensively and pressure in practice. Look out East Coast Conference!

Last year was one for the books for the baseball team. They were east coast conference champions, tied the season win record, made it further than any team in school history, and had one member drafted to the LA Dodgers. Will they be able to keep up with their own success this upcoming season?
Head baseball coach Mike Gaffney credits the accomplishments last year to a good senior class. The nine seniors went through a lot of adversity, but improved year-to- year. Senior leadership is something that Coach Gaffney thinks really pushed the Pioneers to the top.
Now that the team has earned respect, they have to stay motivated to go even further this year. The Pioneers are now in fall ball, with a 3-0 record. To keep the same success as last year, Gaffney is trying to see who is going to step up as a leader to play the roles that seniors played last year. He wants his players to realize that they are very talented, but they are not where they need to be yet. “They need to realize that we need to continue to work just has hard as if we didn’t have a winning record and this I think will help with a lot of our success on the eld this season,” Gaffney said.
With 40 members on the team this year, and only four seniors, Gaffney said that some of the younger guys will need to step up and be leaders if they want to be as successful as last season.
Senior Rob Andreoli was the east coast conference player of the year and the eastern collage athletic conference Division II player of the year last season. Andreoli thought that his team could have made it even further in the regional tournament. He feels that this upcoming season will be better. “We were a couple wins away last year from winning it, but like I said before, now that we have a little taste of it, we are really working hard to get back to where we were,” Andreoli said. He also believes they have a bunch of guys who are ready to step up and fill in the roles of those players and be just as efficient.
Gaffney and Andreoli are excited for this season and ready to go even further. Their goals for this year are to return to regionals and win their conference tournament. “But our main goal that any coach will tell you is to get better than the year before. Now that we set our standard so high it’s going to be a little tougher but I think we are embracing that challenge,” Gaffney said.

Growing up, just about every little boy dreams of one day being drafted by a Major League Baseball team. For LIU Post closer Dan Jagiello, that dream became a reality. In Round 34 of the 2017 MLB Draft, the Los Angeles Dodgers selected Jagiello, with pick number 1,030. “Being drafted was definitely a dream come true,” Jagiello said. “Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve been wanting to play professional baseball. Hearing and seeing my name on the draft board was definitely a surreal feeling.”
Jagiello had a fine season for LIU Post last year. He finished the season with a 1-3 record, a 1.93 ERA and 12 saves in 23.1 innings pitched. He impressed scouts with his repertoire of pitches. “Dan’s best pitch is his fastball. It was electric,” Pioneers catcher Anthony Vaglica said. “Jagiello also possesses a changeup and a slider which makes him a very effective relief pitcher.”
Jagiello attributes a lot of his success to his coach at LIU, Mike Gaffney. Coach Gaffney worked closely with Jagiello since he arrived at Post in 2016. “Coach Gaffney was very supportive during the whole process,” Jagiello said. “I know he was talking to scouts for me to put in a good word for me.”The transition from college ball to pro ball hasn’t been easy, Jagiello said. The overall talent of the hitters skyrockets the second you sign your professional contract. “You can tell that the hitters are better overall,” Jagiello said. “Transitioning onto a new team is always different but everyone in the Dodger organization was very welcoming and made the transition easier. They also helped with how to attack batters and throw different pitches.”
It is one thing to be drafted, but not everyone who is drafted gets signed to a contract. That cannot be said for Jagiello, who immediately after being drafted, signed with the Dodgers and began his journey to the major leagues. “I started off in rookie ball in Arizona with the AZL Dodgers,” Jagiello said. “Then I got moved up to Low A in Midland, Michigan with the Great Lakes Loons.” In the four months since being drafted, Jagiello is 2-1 with a 3.91 ERA and 31 strikeouts in 25.1 innings. He has registered three saves in his first four attempts.
Being drafted by the Dodgers, one of the most storied franchises in major league history, is something that Jagiello does not take lightly. The Dodgers organization has included legends such as Jackie Robinson, Sandy Koufax and, Clayton Kershaw. “I’m very proud to be a Dodger. Everyone in this organization is very proud to be part of such rich history,” Jagiello said. He will continue his journey to the MLB in April, when the 2018 season begins. He will begin the season as a member of the Low-A Great Lake Loons of the Midwest League.
