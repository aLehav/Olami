From February 19-21 and 25-28, the Post Theatre Company will present “Bernarda Alba” at the Little Theatre Main Stage. “Bernarda Alba” is, “an all-female musical based on the play ‘The House of Bernada Alba’ by Federico Garcia Lorca,” according to Heather Drastal, general manager of the Post Theatre Company.
“This intensely theatrical musical chronicles the growing awareness on the part of Bernarda’s five daughters that there is a new world apart from the one imposed by their domineering mother. As they seek to embrace their individuality and see that their dreams for the future don’t mesh with Bernarda’s restrictions, the daughters must ask the question: do they limit the possibilities of life’s journey by accepting their mother’s repressive moral codes?” Drastal said.
Meghan Gratzer, senior musical theater major, explained that the musical was chosen as a production because “we have a lot of strong, powerful women in our department and the faculty felt this was the perfect group of women for a production like this.” Gratzer, who is also starring in the show, is very excited about taking part in the production.
“It’s really awesome to get the opportunity to be in a show like this for my last semester. This process has been absolutely incredible; this cast is so erce and the production team is absolutely amazing,” she said.
Emily Banks, a junior musical theater major, will play the role of Martario in the production. Banks complimented the camaraderie between the members of the company. “We are all there for each other on the stage and o and we are like one big family,” she said.
Banks stated that the Post Theatre Company is a great organization for students to join because “students are able to fulfill their passion for theater, the productions are student run and we can show off our own work and the work of others.” As for the benefits of the company, Banks explained she likes seeing her fellow peers perform on stage and grow throughout their involvement in the organization.
Freshmen in the musical theater and acting programs will have a chance to show off their talents for the first time at the First Year Showcase from April 8-10. “The First Year Showcase gives freshmen the time to shine,” said Nancy Quintana, a senior musical theater major. “This is their introduction to the department since they don’t participate in the Post Theatre Company during their first semester. So for the First Year Showcase, freshmen are able to act out scenes or musical numbers on stage.”
The Post Theatre Company puts on student run theater productions throughout the year. Through the company, students are able to take on all roles of a stage production, including acting, directing and becoming crewmembers. Past productions during this academic year have included “Venus” in October, “Twelfth Night” in November and “Gifts of the Magi” in December.
Gratzer took part in the production and spoke of the relationship between the Tilles Center and the Post Theatre Company. “I was in ‘Gifts of the Magi’ at the Tilles Center and it was really exciting for Tilles and PTC to create something exciting together.”
In addition to “Bernarda Alba” and the First Year Showcase this semester; two thesis projects: “It All” by Abby Slocum and “Unless” by Laura Chamberlain and Cameron Clay will be performed March 4-6, and “Over and Over” by Anna Betteridge in April.
Drastal believes that all students should see at least one performance that the Post Theatre Company puts on. “We are doing a lot or original work that cannot be seen anywhere else, much of it generated by students,” he said. “It is contemporary, relevant and accessible to student audiences. We also bring in professional artists (directors and designers) to work on the productions, so you are seeing cutting edge, professional-grade theater, directed by NYC directors, right here on campus.”
Tickets can be purchased at the Post Theatre Company Box Office, which is open every performance day and remains open an hour and a half before curtain. To reserve tickets, email post-ptc@liu.edu or call 516-299-2356. General Admission is $10. Students and senior citizens are $5 with an ID and there are discounts for groups with more than 10 people.

Abbath; he looks like he could t seamlessly into the lineup for KISS. He acts like in a childish, almost satirical way, but yet the man is a black metal icon. He and his former band, “Immortal,” have never been a part of the “murder, church burning” controversy that surrounded the genre in the 1990s. Rather he became a cult icon in the world of metal because he has never taken himself or his band and music too seriously.
Now, Olve ‘Abbath’ Eikemo has gone solo. It sounds just as cold and good as his former adventures to the “kingdom cold.”
The album, conveniently titled “Abbath,” is his first attempt by himself since he started in 1990. The album starts off with conventional, fast paced groove in two big sounding tracks. Dissonant chords over rumbling drums and grim vocals make out the tracks, “To War!” and, “Winterbane” before it is slowed down. An acoustic guitar plucked briskly, in what sounds like a huge hall. It’s quiet, and the guitar echoes off the walls. It is cold.
The plucking is disrupted by the fastest and loudest track on the album, “Ashes of the Damned.” Fast paced drumming, and even big band horn sections is evident, before the album continues into a more conventional few tracks. Not as intense or “atmospherical,” but just as heavy. It feels like a break in between intervals at the gym. It’s needed and appreciated.
Shortly after, we’re back at it. Intense and heavy. The latter half of the album is where “Abbath” sounds the most like old “Immortal.” Contrasts in tempo, volume and cadences characterize the rest of the album.
It does not seem like Eikemo misses his old bandmates. He thrives alone. The self-titled album has a cold soundscape that “Immortal” fans are familiar with, but it is not the same. It is something new and refreshing. It’s as if Eikemo has a new boost.
“Abbath” is out now on Season of Mist. He is also currently on tour and comes to New York April 12, at Webster Hall.

For this year’s Oscar nominations there are 20 contenders for acting awards, and every single one of the nominees is white. Not only that, all films that had a “black theme,” have been completely overlooked for the best picture category. This makes some of us wonder, is this really about having talent, or is this something minorities should, perhaps, take personally?
Well, many have already answered this question. As soon as the nominations came out, many took their frustrations to Twitter where the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, from last year, was brought back to life.
I was never one to really question who was part of the Academy, or one to care for the Oscars, really. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always watched them, but I never really paid attention to who got nominated or not. The Oscars have become more boring to me as every year goes by. However, this hashtag has definitely gotten my attention and led me to do some research on my own.
According to a study done in 2012 by the Los Angeles Times, Oscar voters are nearly 94-percent Caucasian and 77-percent male, meaning that blacks are close to 2-percent of the Academy and Latinos are even less than 2-percent. This study also showed that only 14 percent of Oscar voters are under 50-years-old. In other words, if the Academy itself isn’t diverse, how diverse can their top picks really be?
This is the second year in a row that all the Oscar nominees are white actors. Movies with black themes did receive recognition, but the recognition they received were for the white people who contributed to the movie, meaning that the black directors and actors were completely ignored.
In light of this, filmmaker Spike Lee, along with Will and Jada Pinkett Smith have announced that they will not be attending the ceremony, and honestly I can’t blame them. I understand that some movies may be considered better quality than others, but to completely ignore diversity for two years in a row in the nominations is pushing it.
Everybody has his or her own taste in film. I might like “The Notebook” whereas somebody else may like “The Wolf of Wall Street.” But when a group of individuals who share similar qualities, (white older males), are the ones choosing what movies are the top picks for the year, and all the movies that involved races that were not white are not even considered, it truly makes me wonder.
Senior broadcasting major, Jeniel Terrero, feels very strongly about this topic and he is quite proud that people are shining light on an issue that to him, is rarely brought up.
“We live in a generation where people are becoming aware of issues and are taking a stand on it,” Terrero said. “The Oscars is an issue that I’ve been following because as someone of color I believe that there is a lack of representation in Hollywood.”
Terrero feels that people of color very rarely get recognized, and if they do, it’s usually because they’re serving a stereotypical role. However, Terrero does not believe that the problem is with the Academy. “It’s really about the lack of substantial opportunities given to people of color,” he said.
Data from a study done at the Bunche Center at UCLA shows that in the year 2013, over 80 percent of the lead actors in a theatrical film were white whereas only 17 percent were black.
As college students, some may think this issue is not really something they should care about, but Terrero believes that students should because this doesn’t only happen in Hollywood. “This problem also reflects real life job opportunities, or lack of them that are offered to people of color,” he said. “As someone who wants to work in the media, I feel like I have to work twice as hard to make sure that my work speaks for me and lands me a job that isn’t based on my ethnic background.”
The hashtag #OscarsSoWhite is one that should be taken seriously by not only the Academy, but the entire movie industry. It’s 2016, and it’s time to start sharing roles and actually bring in diversity into Hollywood; diversity that is not only recognized when minorities are playing stereotypical roles.

As we find ourselves currently surrounded by political talk in this presidential election year, I can’t help but think that there are still people out there who are afraid of using the term “feminism” or who don’t believe that there still is such thing as gender inequality. Although a lot has changed from the past, starting with women being able to vote and holding top leadership positions in government and business, we still are searching for the equal treatment we deserve.
Some opponents to feminism believe that the goal was already achieved with the feminization of the workforce. They see modern feminists as man-haters who are just looking to benefit their own sex. In fact, many women find themselves afraid to say they are feminists because of the misconception that is tied into this term. Supporters of feminism, though, believe that this movement is all about, not only social, but also economic equality of sexes.
I think it’s important to understand that feminism does not mean hatred towards men; this is a misconception that should be cleared up. In 2014, actress and Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Women, Emma Watson, gave a speech for the HeForShe campaign in which she spoke about this misconception. Watson acknowledged that many women don’t want to be associated with this word because it is viewed as not only aggressive and anti-men, but also unattractive.
In her speech, Watson stated what the modern feminist movement is looking for. “I think it is right I am paid the same as my male counterparts; I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body; I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life; I think it is right that socially, I am afforded the same respect as men.”
We are constantly seeing gender stereotypes, where the woman is sensitive and fragile and the man is strong and emotionless. Watson addressed how men are affected by this just as much as women are. Most young boys must keep this stereotypical view of masculinity and not break the status quo. However, there have been some changes and a lot of women and men now understand what the word feminism actually means. Some politicians, including President Obama, claim to be feminists.
So much more can be done today. Women and men can both break down gender stereotypes and be able to be who they actually are without being afraid of seeming too masculine or too feminine. Men won’t have to worry about keeping their emotions bottled up for fear or seeming less masculine, and women will be able to be seen as equals to men.
I am quite glad that we are starting to see this change by having female leaders and CEOs. Senior public relations major, Marisa Kofmehl, thinks that it’s great that women are taking on these powerful positions, for the sake of coming generations. “I think the most important [reason] is that it would open a lot of doors for young girls. They would see that they don’t have these barriers set in place by gender stereotypes,” Kofmehl said.
Yet, despite these advances, according to the American Association of University Women, an organization that empowers women, the pay gap in the U.S. hasn’t shifted in a decade. A woman with the same amount of preparation and education—sometimes even more than a man—gets paid 22 percent less, which proves gender inequality still lingers in our modern society.
I do not believe that we have achieved gender equality in 2016. Although we must follow in the footsteps of the suffragist movement, I still believe we have a long way to go to reach a society where there is no gender inequality. Getting rid of the pay gaps between women and men could be a first step; two people who are equally qualified to do a job should be paid the same no matter what gender they are.
Women and men are different, yes, but that doesn’t make one more important than the other. Both sexes should be seen as equals, and I believe one day this will happen. I do believe it’s important to point out that feminism isn’t about women only; men should be included in this movement too. Equality involves all of us and people shouldn’t be afraid of wanting this in their society.

Honey Roche, a senior business administration major, is a midfielder/defender for the women’s lacrosse team. Roche was a member of the 2013 National Championship team and made the NCAA All-Tournament Team in 2014. Last season as a junior, Roche scored 28 goals and notched eight assists. She looks to lead the Pioneers to another memorable season.
Q: What influenced your decision to come to Post?
A: I knew I wanted to come to Post the second I stepped on campus. I loved the campus, the lacrosse team, coaching staff and just the overall atmosphere at the school. I knew it was the right fit for me.
Q: As a senior, how do the younger players look up to you as a leader?
A: I try my best to lead by example both on and off the field. I put the team first and I’m always there for my teammates. I hope to be someone the underclassmen can look up to.
Q: Can you describe the feeling of winning a National Championship back in your freshman year?
A: Winning the championship my freshman year was the most unbelievable experience. It’s honestly hard to put it into words. It was an amazing way to start off my college career and I would like nothing more than to end on that same note.
Q: How did learning from players like Jackie Sileo and Co. help you grow and develop on the collegiate level?
A: I have played with some incredible alumni, including Jackie Sileo, BC Drost, Bridgett Soares and more. They taught me so much about life and lacrosse and continue to support our team. It was a privilege to be able to play with them.
Q: What would you say is your biggest goal this season after you guys weren’t given a bid into last year’s NCAA Tournament?
A: I think our biggest goal this season is to focus on ourselves. This is a new year and a new team. We can’t look back on our past success or failure and we can’t look too far ahead. We are just taking it one day at a time and I am very excited to see what this team can do.
Q: How does being a midfielder/defender help you see all aspects of the game on both offense and defense?
A: Playing midfield helps open my eyes and understand more about the game. [Coach] Meg continues to teach me all the little things that help me see the field better and anticipate the next play.
Q: What is the strongest asset of your game and why?
A: I think the strongest asset of my game is my passion. I love the game of lacrosse, sometimes too much. I always push myself to my limits and encourage my teammates to do the same.
Q: How long have you been playing lacrosse and what inspired you to play?
A: I started playing lacrosse in second grade. My older siblings all played, so I couldn’t wait to get on the field. I quickly fell in love with the game and couldn’t get enough of it.
Q: Do you have any other interests or hobbies?
A: I enjoy playing basketball and spikeball. I always like to try new things (and I usually do that with my siblings) like skydiving or riding in hot air balloons.
Q: What is your favorite part about playing lacrosse?
A: My favorite part about playing lacrosse is just going out there and having fun. That’s easy to do when your teammates are your best friends. We make the most out of every practice and love just messing around on the field.
Q: Who is the one person that you most admire?
A: The person I admire most is our old assistant coach, Alyssa Kildare. She has taught me so much about both life and lacrosse. I still keep in touch with her and reach out to her for any advice I need.
Q: What is your most significant moment as an individual in college?
A: When I think of my experiences throughout college, I don’t consider it an individual effort. Every success and accomplishment has been because of my teammates. Even if it was something off the field, they were the ones pushing me to do my best. My most significant moment as an individual was the day I joined the team, and ever since then it’s just been about us as a whole.

Despite putting up 87 points and nearly erasing a double-digit deficit with under a minute left in the fourth quarter, the Pioneers fell to Molloy College by a score of 95-87 on Wednesday, Feb. 10, at the Pratt Recreation Center.
With time running out, the Pioneers trailed 69-59, but rallied to make a game of it. Senior forward Nyasia Davis was the sparkplug who ignited the offense late; scoring seven of the 12 points in a 12-2 run by the Pioneers to force overtime.
In the overtime, neither side gave an edge. Key baskets from senior guard Khea Gibbs and junior forward Melsha Messam propelled the match into another extra session. In the second overtime, Gibbs got the Pioneers off to a solid start, but Molloy answered back with an 8-0 run to put the game on ice.
Davis finished with 26 points and 15 rebounds (both season-highs), while Gibbs added 23 points, five boards and five assists. Molloy was led by six double-digit scorers; with senior guard Alexia O’Connor being the top gun with 21 points on 6-of-7 from the floor.
The Pioneers looked to bounce back on Saturday, Feb. 13, when they visited Queens College. Sophomore Queens guard Madison Rowland had other plans though, as she put up 25 points to go along with 13 boards, four steals and three blocks. Rowland and Co. won by a score of 67-50.
The Pioneers played a solid first half and were led by senior guard Jalyn Brown who had seven points including one shot from down town at the break. At intermission, the Pioneers held a 27- 25 advantage.
In the second half, Queens put the game out of reach with a combination of great defense and good shots. In points off turnovers in the latter stanza, Queens held a 25-2 upper hand and they also held a 12-2 advantage in fast break points. Queens cruised to victory, due in part to a 12-2 run to open the fourth quarter, which put the game out of reach.
For the Pioneers, Gibbs was the high scorer with 13 while Messam ended up with nine points and seven rebounds. The Pioneers, led by head coach Deirdre Moore, will try and get back on track on Friday, Feb. 19, when they visit Daemen College. Tip-off is set for 6 p.m. from Amherst, N.Y.

Despite a 20-point effort from Molloy guard Curtis Jenkins, the Pioneers (14-10) survived a last-second scare as they held on to beat Molloy College (6-16) on Wednesday, Feb. 10, 60-57, in an East Coast Conference battle at the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y.
With just 27 seconds to go, sophomore forward Hunter Powell cashed in the go-ahead put-back lay-up to give the Pioneers a 56-54 edge. Junior guard Jared Hall eventually put the game to sleep as he knocked down four straight free throws, snapping a five-game skid.
In a closely contested game, the Pioneers used the three-ball to gain momentum in the second half and take a 54-47 lead. Senior guard Akosa Maduegbunam provided a spark off the bench, draining two of his three trifectas during that stretch as guards Devon McMillan and Aary Bibens were both sidelined, leaving the Pioneers thin in the backcourt.
Molloy refused to go away quietly as they responded with a 7-0 burst of their own with 2:31 to go in regulation. Senior guard Brandon Williams who tallied 18 points for the evening, splashed in a pair of free throws to tie the game at 54 apiece.
Hall continued his breakout-campaign for the Pioneers, logging 24 points and nine rebounds. Senior guard Dillon Burns racked up 12 points, eight assists and four boards. Junior forward Greg Dotson scored a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.
Defensively, the Pioneers held the visitors to just 27 percent shooting from the field and only 24 percent from downtown.
The Pioneers returned to the floor on Saturday, Feb. 13, where they came up short against Queens College (8-12) in another ECC tilt, 76-65, at Fitzgerald Gymnasium.
Although the Pioneers trailed throughout most of the game, they eclipsed an 8-0 spurt to tie the game at 42-all at the 13:54 mark of the latter stanza. Dotson paved the way with three consecutive baskets and Burns buried a jumper to even things up.
However, Queens re-fueled themselves and pushed the pedal to the medal, taking a 65-53 lead, pulling away from the visitors.
Queens guard Simon Green finished with 20 points off the bench to lead all scorers. For the Pioneers, Burns collected 13 points before fouling out. The visitors struggled from the field, shooting just 33 percent and 16 percent from downtown.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and his Pioneer squad now drop to 9-7 in ECC play and look to rebound Friday, Feb. 19, versus Daemen College in Amherst, N.Y. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.

The baseball team got its season underway on Saturday, Feb. 13, in Gaffney, S.C. as it played a set of games against Limestone College. The Pioneers dropped both of those games by scores of 4-1 and 5-2.
In game one, the Pioneers plated their first and only run curtesy of three wild pitches. Limestone evened up the game in the third inning on a run-scoring single, and one inning later they seemed poised to do more damage. With the bases loaded, Limestone added one run, but the Pioneers turned a key double-play to escape the threat. Limestone scored an additional two runs in the fifth and six innings thanks to wild pitches.
Junior pitcher Jake DeCarli took the loss, his first of the year, while tossing 4.2 innings, allowing three earned runs and striking out five. His counterpart, sophomore southpaw Anders DeShields, went seven frames, giving up one earned run and fanning five Pioneers.
In the second game, both teams got on the board early. After sophomore outfielder James Cohan led the game off with a single, fellow sophomore outfielder Rob Andreoli sent him home after he swiped second base. In Limestone’s half of the inning, they liked the Pioneers style of play and did their best imitation of it. After a walk and steal of second base, Limestone plated a run on a double to even the score at one.
In the top of the fifth, Andreoli connected again and notched his second RBI of the game with a double, which tied the game at two. In the fifth inning still tied at two, the Pioneer defense committed three errors which directly led to three runs; the big blow being a two-run home run by freshman infielder Chase Allen, which made it 5-2 in favor of Limestone.
Limestone got another strong outing from their starting pitcher, as senior pitcher Bryon Munsterman logged 6.1 innings and struck out eight Pioneers in the process.
Mike Gaffney and the Pioneers are back in action on Friday, Feb. 26, when they play St. Edward’s University in Austin, Texas at 1:30 p.m. The Pioneers play their first home game on Tuesday, March 15, against American International College.
