 The Pioneer’s Co-Editor-in-Chief Jada Butler is hard at work at her internship with Vice.com this summer in Brooklyn. Butler is an  Editorial Intern for Vice’s issues desk, covering a range of topics from transportation, environment, health, inequality and more for a national audience.
“I’m learning so much about media and news coverage on a national scale, and how to pitch a story that could reach a broader audience,” Butler said. “Vice is cool because it’s  a media company that isn’t just reacting to change, but trying to be a  part of that change in society and evolve their narrative to meet that  same energy that their audience wants in their news.”
