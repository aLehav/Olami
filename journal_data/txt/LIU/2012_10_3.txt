On Tuesday, September 25th at 10 p.m., two LIU Post students were arrested on campus for allegedly selling and possessing a substantial amount of the drug known as Ecstasy. According to the Nassau County Police Department, Frank Catalano, 20, of Brooklyn and Ryan Sloane, 20, of Westbury were arrested by the department’s Asset Forfeiture Unit. 
Both students are members of the Post baseball team. Sloane is a junior business major at Post and a pitcher for the Pioneers, and Catalano, also a junior business major, is an outfielder for the team.
The two students are being charged with a number of felonies, including second and third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, second-degree criminal possession of marijuana and fifth-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance. The students were arraigned in the First District Court in Hempstead on Wednesday, September 26th.
Catalano and Sloane as well as their coach and lawyers did not respond to the Pioneer’s multiple requests for comment. According to Dr. William Gustafson, Associate Provost for Student Success, “We cannot comment directly on matters of student records or student conduct proceedings. LIU Post students who are members of our Athletic Program are also responsible for upholding the conduct policies of the Athletic Department and the NCAA.” The Pioneer staff will continue covering this story and will be posting a more detailed version on the Pioneer website.

The LIU Post Pioneers men’s soccer team has climbed to number one in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America Division II National rankings. It is the first time in the history of the program that the Pioneers have been ranked number one. 
The Pioneers are one of two teams in Division II that are still undefeated. Gannon is the only other team that has not lost a game. 
For both the players and coaching staff, the number one ranking is an acknowledgement of all their hard work. “It’s a great feeling, to finally get paid for the hard work we have put (in) the last months,” said junior captain Eirik Bjoernoe. 
“It is an awesome feeling to be ranked number one,” added head coach Andreas Lindberg. “And a testament to our players and staff that we are doing something right.”
The Pioneers have out¬scored opponents 30-9 this season, with leading scorer sophmore Elvind Austboe accounting for eight goals this season. The pioneers also have the sixth ranked offense in Division II.
But, despite the early success both Bjoerno and Lindberg know that there is still plenty more to accomplish. 
“We know we haven’t accomplished anything yet and we are only half way through the season,” Lindberg said. “We have a lot of work left to do and our ultimate goal is to make it back to the NCAA tournament. Once there, anything can happen.”
Bjoerno added: “We have a lot of unfinished business to take care of and we know this puts an even bigger target on our back.” 
LIU Post has several tough matches coming up with several top teams in the region, which includes a game against number six ranked Umass Lowell. Their next game is on Wednesday, October 3, against Mercy College.

You know fall is here when everything tastes like pumpkin, the temperature noticeably drops, the day becomes night quicker than expected, and the box of scarves and jackets (the one you thought you had left behind to forget), needs to be dusted off. Some people experience the fall just as a reminder that the dreaded winter is closer than it has been in a year, and legs and arms need to be covered up yet another time. Some of us descend into fall depression. No matter how hard we try to steal what is left of the warm weather, it is slowly strolling away from us. It is out of our control, which is something we have to realize. However, fall depression is possible to avoid.
Research suggests that some people lack energy and feel depressed during the fall because they do not get exposed to the sun as much as they do during the summer. Sunlight increases the production of endorphins and serotonin in your brain. With this in mind, you do not have an excuse for not getting out during the day. Try to do homework or eat outside on sunny days. 
Research also suggests that staying active, as well as getting enough sunlight, releases the “happy”-hormones in your brain, which is going to make you feel better even after working out one time. Re¬member, all students have free access to the Pratt. However, there are other ways to stay in shape. Hiking is a great way to do so, especially now with the colorful fall scenery. The Sunken Forest in Fire Island is a beautiful area to try, perfect for long walks or jogs. Drive to Sayville and take the ferry to Fire Island from there. Taking walks in general is good for body and mind, even if it is just around our campus. 
Wear the fall – it has beautiful colors, so why not play with it and dress like it? Try brown, red, orange and other warm colors. Put on your favorite scarf, jacket, jeans and sunglasses. Buy magazines, get inspired and check out this season’s trends. This gives you a reason to shop for new clothes. If you feel good on the outside, the inside will follow.
Fall is the season for pumpkin lovers, and this is something Starbucks appreciates. Their seasonal favorite coffees are now served, so stop by and get warm with a delicious cup of Pumpkin Spice Latte or Salted Caramel Mocha (the Chai Tea Latte is also a favorite, although it is served at all times of the year). These drinks could please a seasonally depressed soul. 
Speaking of pumpkin, now is the time to go pumpkin picking. Gather a group of friends, pick pumpkins at a farm, and then carve and paint them later. It may feel corny because you are not a kid anymore, but surprisingly enough, doing things you used to do when you were younger is actually very fun and it brings back good memories. 
Halloween is coming up, so why not decorate your dorm? Assign a couple of hours with your roommate to do so. Go to Target or a Halloween store and find as many decorations as you would like, and before you know it, your room will be ready. Again, doing kid stuff brings back good memories. 
“I’m not a big fall-fan, but I do think it’s better in the U.S. than in Norway,” said Mathilde Laderud, a junior International Studies major. “It’s warmer here than home. I also like that I don’t have to feel bad for not doing anything inside when it’s raining outside, which it often does in the fall.” 
“Fall and spring are my favorite seasons. It’s not too cold, but cold enough that I can wear warm jackets, and on cold nights, spend time with friends inside,” said Maiken Prestmo, a sophomore Political Science major. 
To sum it all up, learn how to love every season by finding out what you can do to make it better.

You’re walking into Hillwood and you pass the front desk, you know that if you have any questions you can stop there and ask, however, have you ever noticed the glass windows directly across from the desk? Behind those windows, is home to the Center for Student Information, which is another important tool for students at LIU Post to take advantage of. At CSI you can be assisted with any of your Post related questions, whether it be about your MyLIU account, how to register for graduation or anything else you may not be sure about. However, many students seem to not know about this handy department. 
Jason Pistorino, the Associate Director for CSI, explains exactly what it is that they do. “We want to be a useful source for all students at Post.” There are so many things that the CSI office can provide assistance with, one of the main ones currently being handling iPad pick-ups and payments. And that is only the tip of the iceberg. “We can also teach you how to get into blackboard and everything that is MyLIU related; it’s what we specialize in,” Pistorino continues. No appointments are ever necessary either (unless you are scheduling an iPad pick-up), so whether you need to print an assignment quickly or ask a question, CSI may be helpful to you.
CSI has only been open for a few years and the department is constantly working hard to make it as student friendly as possible. Inside the office you will find couches, a big screen TV, plenty of iPads and even a couple of computers — all there for students to take advantage of. Currently, there are even plans to make it a bit more “visually friendly” for students. According to Pistorino these plans include creating a fun, colorful mural on the walls, as well as anything else that would make the environment more appealing to students. “I think the plans to make it more visually student friendly are great and I want to be involved as much as possible, my friends come in here all the time and they don’t really know how relaxing it is. I think a better image would help us out,” says sophomore Kathryna Gonzalez, an arts management major, who is a student employee at CSI. These plans would be helpful, agrees sophomore Anya Kurkina, a journalism major. “I didn’t know students could just go and hang out. It seems like the couches are just for them, you see a lot of the same people in their all the time, it doesn’t always seem very welcoming.” Although, Kurkina was pleased with the fact that picking up her iPad was easy and didn’t take very long. 
The freshmen are first exposed to CSI and what it offers during freshman orientation. Also, students that have iPads from Post have a CSI app on their homepage, which they can click for more information. As a part of the CSI department, there is a gaming lounge upstairs in Hillwood with consoles such as x-box available for students to use. Throughout the year there are tournaments held and it can be a great place for students to go unwind and have some fun. The third part of the department includes a computer lab, also located upstairs in Hillwood, that students can use anytime for as long as they want. In the computer lab you can print 10 black and white pages for free, after that they are 10 cents apiece, or 25 cents for color. The fax machine in there is also available for students. During midterms and finals, print amnesty is offered. 
With all of these useful tools being offered, it is a shame that many students do not know about CSI. Senior Kim Cruz, an electronic media major was one of those students that wasn’t aware of the department. “CSI… as in the show?” Kim wondered. Sadly, there are many more students whose minds go in a similar direction when asked about CSI. However, once students are informed about all that is offered they are more than keen to take advantage of the services. Kim Poncet, a freshman childhood education major says, “I would like to learn more about CSI and what they can help me with.” Gonzalez also adds, “Basically, we’re a tool that LIU Post provides and students should really take full advantage of it, any concerns, worries, or information they’re not sure about, come here and we’ll give you the best answer we can.” For more information on CSI go to www.csi.liu.edu or just pop in and visit Jason Pistorino or Coordinator, Jennifer Polis.

On Saturday, September 29, the LIU Post Pioneers football team suffered their second consecutive loss of the season. The Pioneers lost in overtime, 31-24, to the Edinboro University Fighting Scots. The Pioneers fell to 2-2 on the season while the Fighting Scots improved to 2-2. 
With the score locked 17-17 deep into the fourth quarter, the Pioneers managed to orchestrate a 10-play, 70-yard drive that would break the tie. Sophomore quarter¬back Steven Laurino fired a 28-yard touchdown pass to redshirt sophomore wide receiver Kamron Palmer to give LIU Post a 24-17 advantage with 31 seconds remaining in the game. 
However, the Pioneers were unable to walk away with a win despite the clutch touchdown late in the game. After electing to squib the ensuing kickoff, the Fighting Scots were given solid field position starting at the Pioneers’ 47-yard line. Following an intentional grounding penalty by Fighting Scots quarterback Cody Harris, things seemed bleak for Edinboro. On third and long, Harris heaved up a prayer that ended up being caught by Fighting Scots sophomore wide receiver Devin Ghafoor for a 35-yard gain. And just like that, Edinboro was given new life and had one last chance to force the game into overtime. On the very next play, Harris connected with senior wide receiver Marcus Johnson over the middle from 12 yards out to even up the score, 24-24. 
The Fighting Scots received possession first to begin the extra session. Harris and the offense would continue their momentum as they would need only two plays to find the end zone and put the pressure back on the Pioneers offense. Once again, Harris found Johnson for a touchdown, this time a 20-yard strike gave the Fighting Scots the advantage. 
As per overtime rules, the Pioneers were given possession of the ball, but they had to score a touchdown to extend the game. Unfortunately for the Pioneers, they were unable to move the chains and came up empty, losing a heartbreaker by a final score of 31-24. 
In the loss, the Pioneers suffered their first turnover of the year when Steven Lauri¬no threw an interception early in the second quarter. For the game, Laurino went 21-38 for 232 yards and one passing touchdown. Laurino also lead the team in rushing as he carried the ball 19 times for 86 yards and a touchdown. Kamron Palmer led the Pioneers with four receptions and 47 yards to go along with the fourth quarter touchdown. In addition, senior tight end Pat Fitzgerald caught a touchdown pass which gave the Pioneers their first points of the game. 
The defense of the Pioneers struggled all afternoon trying to stop junior quarter¬back Cody Harris. He came into the contest with a completion percentage just below 70 percent, and he only improved that number once he was done with the Pioneers. He completed 27 of his 34 passes for 381 yards and three touchdowns, while throwing zero interceptions. 
The Pioneers will try to bounce back off the tough loss next week as they face the Shippensburg University Red Raiders (5-0) on Saturday, October 6. It will not be an easy task as the Red Raiders have averaged scoring over 53 points per game this season and have beaten opponents by an average margin of 34 points per game. 
Tune into 88.1 FM or WCWP.org to hear all the game coverage. Pregame is at 12:30 p.m. and kickoff is scheduled for 1:00 p.m.

The women’s soccer team coasted past the Warriors of Nyack College on Wednesday, September 26, with a 5-2 win on the road. Freshman forward Susanne Vistnes led the Pioneers offense with one goal and three assists for the game. Vistnes added yet another three goals in the game against St. Thomas Aquinas College on Saturday, September 29.
The Pioneers have shown in earlier matches that they have a strong offense, led by Vistnes and junior forward Alexa Niciforo. When the Pioneers traveled to Nyack College, Niciforo and Vistnes kept leading the way. It took only 14 minutes before the two of them linked up for the first time, when Vistnes found Niciforo in front of the goal to get the Pioneers on the board.
Only seven minutes later, the Warriors equalized, but the Pioneers answered twice before halftime. Senior captain Prudence Rydstrom and junior midfielder Lauren Bischoff added a tally each to give the visitors a two-goal lead going into halftime.
The Pioneers did not waste any time in the second half when Vistnes served freshman mid¬fielder Hanna Westerling for the Pioneers’ fourth goal, while Vistnes added the fifth herself. The Warriors scored another with 13 minutes remaining, but the Pioneers easily held on to their three-goal advantage to seal the victory at 5-2. 
The game was never a real challenge for the fifteenth-ranked Pioneers. They held a 16-11 shot advantage, and senior goalkeeper Nicole Fierro only had to make four saves to earn the win. 
Junior captain Karina Rizzo played outstanding defense for the Pioneers, and added two assists to move the Pioneers to 7-1-1. “It was a great win for us. We were expected to win, and it was good to put the game away early on,” Rizzo said after the game. She pointed out a couple of factors helping to make the team successful: “The fact that we are able to get up for the games together and fight hard all game long, gives us an edge compared to other teams in the region.” Moving forward, the captain calls for the same attitude from her teammates. “We need to take care of each game individually in order to be successful and achieve our goal of being champions, both in the region and in the conference.”
The Pioneers continued the road towards their season’s goals on Saturday, September 29, when the ECC match-up against St. Thomas Aquinas College was moved to Brookville, due to in¬clement weather in upstate New York. The girls took advantage of being on home turf, but the game was even at 0-0 by halftime. 
The Pioneers only used two minutes of the second half to get themselves on the board. Vistnes netted her first goal of the evening after a great pass from junior midfielder Jeanine Ambrogi. Vistnes found sophomore midfielder Solveig Bjordal to make the score 2-0 in favor of the Pioneers. Vistnes would later add another two goals herself to put the Pioneers ahead 4-0. 
The Niciforo sisters combined for the next two goals, with freshman midfielder Jackie Niciforo finding her older sister, Alexa, on the fifth goal. In addition, Jackie Niciforo scored a goal to wrap up the game at 6-0. 
“It was an amazing feeling to score my first hat-trick in college, and I’m so proud to be a part of this team,” Vistnes said after the game. 
The Pioneers are now 8-1-1 for the season, and return to action on Wednesday, October 3, against Mercy College for another ECC game. The game is at Dobbs Ferry, and kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m.

The LIU Post women’s volleyball team now has a 10-9 record after losing to Roberts Wesleyan College and defeating the College of Saint Rose on Saturday, September 29. 
In the first match against the Roberts Wesleyan Raiders (6-8), the Pioneers lost in straight sets 3-0 (20-25, 22-25, 14-25). The first two sets were tightly contested between both sides. The Raid¬ers and Pioneers were knotted up at 19-19, but the Raiders would go on a late run to take the first set. In the second set, the score would again be tied late as the teams were even up at 18-18. Once again, the Raiders breezed through the final few points to take a two set lead. The third set was not as competitive as the first two as the Raiders won it 25-14 to win the game. Senior middle blocker Lisa Delfs led the team with seven kills, and freshman libero Rachel Ringor led the team with 13 digs. 
In the second match of the day, the Pioneers would bounce back from the loss with a five-set win against the College of Saint Rose Golden Knights (8-5) by a score of 3-2 (15-25, 25-19, 12-25, 25-16, 15-12). The Pioneers and Golden Knights would alternate winning and losing the first four sets of the game, but the Pioneers would win the decisive fifth set by a score of 15-12. Delfs once again led the Pioneers with 10 kills while junior middle blocker Makamae Namahoe and junior middle hitter Susy Cricchi each had eight kills in the win. The Pioneers also had three players with double figure digs including Namahoe with 16, freshman outside hitter Harlee Meyers with 15, and sophomore setter Lulu Centro with 10. 
The next matchup for the Pioneers is on Thursday, October 4, at home at 7 p.m. against the Queens College Knights (2-13).

The LIU Post Pioneers men’s soccer team downed the Saint Thomas Aquinas College Spartans 4-1 on Saturday, September 29th to continue the team’s perfect season. The Pioneers moved up to number one in the division two national rankings on Tuesday. 
The Pioneers are now 9-0 on the season and 4-0 in East Coast Conference play. 
LIU Post jumped ahead early in the game, scoring the opening goal just five minutes into the match. Freshman back Johan Wallin scored off a rebound shot in front of the net to make it 1-0 Pioneers. The Spartans answered back less than a minute later to tie the game at one. Senior forward Brendan Flynn got the equalizer off a cross from senior forward Joseph Conolly. 
The game would be knotted at one going into halftime. The Pioneers held an 18-7 shots advantage heading into the second half. 
The Pioneers would continue to pressure the Spartans and eventually they would hit pay dirt. In the 67th minute, senior forward Andreas Olson finally put one past the STAC goalkeeper and gave LIU Post the lead once again. Six minutes later, the Pioneers added to that lead when freshman midfielder Per Forgaard scored to make it 3-1. Junior captain Eirik Bjoernoe put the nail in the coffin when he blast¬ed a shot from 18-yards out to make it 4-1 in favor of the Pioneers. 
The Pioneers finished the day with a 36-12 shots advantage and forced STAC keeper Andrew Tartara to make 14 saves. Junior goal¬keeper Marco Jorgensen had to just make four saves for LIU Post. 
The Pioneers will look to extend their undefeated season when they travel to Mercy College for an ECC Matchup on Wednesday, October 4th. This is the first, and only, matchup with Mercy this season. LIU Post last saw them on October 15th, 2011 when they defeated them 1-0.
Wednesday’s contest begins at 4 p.m.

This Sunday night, I, a Long Island girl, was officially from Brooklyn. Well, according to Jay-Z that is. “Everybody’s from Brooklyn tonight!” the rapper proclaimed as he stood on stage on Sunday night, September 30, during day three of his concert series at the new Barclays Center, in the rap¬pers hometown of Brooklyn. This concert series can be described as a tale of two stories coming together. The Barclays Center is now officially the home of the Brooklyn (formerly New Jersey) Nets, and Jay-Z is a part owner of both the arena and the basketball team. What better way to christen the new building other than to perform for his hometown? 
Jay sported a black and white Nets jersey with his last name “Carter” on the back and the number 4, representing both his and wife Beyonce’s birthdays, as well as baby girl Blue Ivy’s name. 
The concert started off with a brief history of Jay-Z’s story, during which he stated, “We are in the middle, in the midst of a historical run in Brooklyn, New York City. We finally got our own franchise and I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the Dodgers wanted to play on this very site…they were going to play on this very land.” It was a very chilling and deep moment for the audience, who were reminded not to let anyone get in the way of their dreams. “I know that if you see me standing here,” Jay-Z went on to say as he pointed to the very stage he was talking about, “I know that you know it’s possible to achieve great things.” Jay-Z went on to introduce late inspirational rappers from Brooklyn such as Biggie and then went into his set. 
The crowd got riled up as Jay rapped to hits such as “99 Problems” and “Brooklyn Go Hard”. The noise, the energy and the blue laser lights all contributed to the incredibly exuberant atmosphere. If I had to make one change? Perhaps, more big screens for the people sitting towards the back of the stage to look at. We can’t all afford to be seated on ground level and the view just wasn’t too great in the upper levels. 
Jay-Z ended with his “Forever Young” hit and the crowd sang and danced along, leaving with a feeling of pure joy. Well done, Jay, well done.

I have watched Grey’s Anatomy for nine seasons now and this is the first time I can honestly say that I absolutely hated the season premiere. It was so morose and depressing that at one point it was actually hard to watch. Last seasons finale was tragic enough with Lexie Grey dying in the plane crash. Now they killed off Mark Sloan, who was one of the funnier characters on the show; not only did they kill him, they made you watch as the life support machines were turned off and his heart very slowly stopped beating. The entire episode you can’t help but want to cry for Callie, as they lead you to believe that her wife, Arizona, died as well. It’s not until the last few minutes of the episode that they reveal that she’s alive but had to have her leg amputated and won’t leave their apartment. 
Derek is a hot mess and can’t operate. He tries but ends up dropping his surgical instrument on the floor and walking out of the OR. Cristina ended up in some nonsense hospital in the mid west with doc¬tors she can’t stand. She also couldn’t bring herself to fly since the crash. Meredith’s interns now know her as “Medusa” and Bailey’s new nickname is BCB standing for booty call bailey.
Although I hated every second of this episode, I’m anticipating this coming week because they are going to show what happened to the group while they were stranded in the woods after the plane crash.

Paul Thomas Anderson belongs to a select group of American filmmakers who have a pronounced and controlled authority in their work. He writes characters that are down on their luck, who are gray and mischievous, and who are addicts, morally unsound and chaotic. Protagonists are virtually nonexistent and are instead replaced by shady anti-heroes. There is a looming sense of liquid anxiety in his films, dragging the viewer into the current, shoving their heads beneath the murky water, and allowing them but a gulp of air every few scenes to placate their willingness to survive the experience. Anderson is a cerebral director who challenges the audience in several ways. The main challenge in Anderson’s latest installment, The Master, is to just stay in your seat. 
This film is definitely not for everyone. The Master is the type of film that does well at film festivals (and it did) and caters acutely to viewers who have the patience for European-style character studies. The key word here is patience. Several people walked out on the film with looks of confusion and anger. Some were so fed up with the film that they were openly vocal about their disdain before leaving the rest of us in our daze. But with a little patience and a bit of extraneous thought, you may dissect from this film a unique experience that departs from the norms of American cinema, and takes you to places that are both uncomfortable and refreshing all at once.
The Master has widely been hyped as fodder for the Academy Awards, but even with its interesting story of futility and faith, the intangibility of the plot at times may be crippling in the race for Best Picture. This film instead finds its greatest potential in acting, writing, cinematography, and musical score. Anderson has written freshly commanding characters for The Master, characters who dominate the world they live in with very forceful personalities, set unto the cacophony of Johnny Greenwood’s musical score. Green¬wood worked on Anderson’s 2007 film There Will Be Blood and carries on in the creation of chaotic scores that swerve neatly from anarchic beats to sweeping string arrangements.
Phillip Seymour Hoffman shows his acting chops as the self proclaimed 1950’s poly¬math, Lancaster Dodd, whose life is loosely based on the likeness of Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The character is self-righteous, forcing his cause upon others as total truth, despite its absurdities. Hoff¬man’s group of believers include Amy Adams as Mary Sue Dodd, whose constant presence on screen besides her husband speaks volumes, and who is likely to receive a nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her efforts.
Lancaster Dodd is the titular “master” who seeks to tame the alcoholic vagrant and U.S. Navy veteran Freddy Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) with the mystic teachings of “the cause.” Phoenix is brilliant as the violent and twisted alcoholic. You can almost smell the liquor on his breath when he is on screen, his drunken and sexually frustrated encounters with the world involving the viewer in an arduous game of believe versus disbelief. We are left to wonder if there is any truth at all to the story of Freddy Quell, who declares himself a liar, and whose spirit, sunken as it is under the weight of post-war America, is ultimately that of a vagabond sailor. If you take the challenge, and indeed sit down for this film, you may be surprised in more ways than one.

After the release of Skyrim by Bethesda in November of 2011, the first expansion for the game was released for X-Box 360 and for PC in August. Dawnguard introduces a lot of new items such as armor and weapons as well as new areas to explore, with twenty-two new quests that include both story-related and side quests. 
Dawnguard is a powerful vampire clan, Vampire Lords in the game, who have obtained an Elder Scroll which contains information on how to blot out the sun for good. The sun is the vampires’ main weakness. How¬ever, the vampire hunters wish to eradicate the vampires and stop their plans. As the player, you can choose either side of the battle.
Both sides have interesting quests as well as great perks to help you in battle. If you choose to be a vampire lord, you transform into a sinister looking demon-figure. When I saw the transformation, I thought it looked pretty cool but, I was hoping for something more scary and I felt their wings were lacking. It’s really annoying how the sun makes you weaker and if you don’t feed on enough blood daily, people start to fear and hate you. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view. The vampires in the game have always had a lot of issues like this which makes sense because, duh, their vampires. You bite enemies to take their life energy and drain their power. As you get stronger, the more abilities you have such as summoning gargoyles. 
As a Dawnguard vampire hunter, you gain new armor and weapons like a crossbow, which you can enchant and upgrade like other weapons in the game. You gain rank and can gain armored trolls to aid in battle temporarily. 
There is a lot of new content in the game, not just quests. The werewolf, which was already available, has been updated and now has its own skill tree. So if you loved being a werewolf, you can now upgrade and customize the attacks of your werewolf form, such as summoning ice wolves to aid you in combat and upgrading your strength to epic proportions.
There are new creatures in the game like death hounds, a mount that you gain in a quest that’s an undead, skeletal horse, and dragon bone weapons. You have no idea how awesome it is to roll into the near¬by town on an undead horse with a sword made from dragon bones while slaughtering everyone.
This is one of my favorite games to play and now that there has been even more awesome content added such as epic quest lines, it only got better. This expansion is great for anyone who is playing Skyrim already. I must give this expansion a nine out of ten!

Located off the pristine Andaman Sea, Phuket is Thai¬land’s largest island and one of the world’s most popular beach destinations that offers a rainbow spectrum of spectacular vacation sights from blue lagoons and pink sunsets to orange-robed monks. The country’s main source of income is tourism, though agriculture also plays a key role. The island city made headlines back in 2004 after suffering from a tsunami caused by an Indian Ocean earthquake. The waves destroyed several highly populated areas in the region killing up to 5,300 people nationwide. De¬spite these difficult times, Phuket maintained their high standards and continues to be a booming cosmopolitan town that offers a multitude of affordable accommodations, as well as a variety of different shopping and dining destinations. 
Airlines: Traveling to Phuket International Airport by plane can be somewhat of an ad¬venture for tourists coming from all over the globe. The trend is for many tourists to come through Bangkok catching domestic flights via Thai Airways, which run regularly through the day, seven days a week. Several other airlines fly to Phuket like United Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Asiana Airlines, and China Airlines. No airlines fly direct from United States to Phuket. 
Hotels: With the well-known Thai hospitality, Phuket hotels services are guaranteed to be part of the holiday experience. From modest to majestic, from guesthouse to five-star resort, from beachside bungalow to city center hotel, accommodation choices are reflected by their differing prices. Popular hotels include Holiday Inn Phuket, Le Meridien Phuket Bach Resort, and Dusit Thani Laguna. Patong Beach, with its lush tropical land¬scape, is the oasis of calm that sits at the heart of one of Phuket’s most vibrant and popular areas, making it the perfect location for an enjoyable holiday with friends or family in an ultra-convenient location. 
Attractions/Sightseeing: With its glittering temples, impressive scenery, idyllic beaches, and friendly locals, Phuket Island is immensely rewarding to those who take the time to explore its attractions. Renowned in the Kathu District is Patong Beach, the lively shopping and evening entertainment district that trans¬formed a quiet fishing village into a bustling town in a short period of time. From bars to live music to discos, cuisine from all over the world is available in its restaurants. Not to be overlooked is the fine bay and two mile stretch of beach that promises excellent swimming and snorkeling. Among the major attractions in the vicinity are Phuket Water-Ski Cableways, Kathu Waterfall, Loch Palm Golf Club and Tarzan Jungle Bungee Jump. At the northern end of Patong Beach is the wilder, undeveloped Kalim Beach, an ad¬venturous stop for travelers looking to get away from the crowds. Covering the northern half of the island, Thalang District has a number of attractions including Thalang National Museum, which has a display of ancient artifacts and exhibits relating to the famous 1785 Battle of Thalang. Also in the area is Wat Phra Tong, home of the golden statue of Bud¬dha that emerged from the earth many years ago. A must-do in Phuket is a walk in the old part of Phuket City, around Thalang, Dibuk, and Krabi roads. The beautiful architecture along these roads will take you back to the charm of a century ago. This area provides a less expensive alternative to the west coast beach resorts. Phuket Town is the administrative center of the island and offers a ton of things to see, including Phuket Aquarium, the Phuket Butterfly Garden and Aquarium, and the Phuket Orchid Garden and Thai Village. 
Cuisine: Thai food, as exotic as it is, needs no introduction. Visitors to Phuket will be overwhelmed by the variety of food and dining experiences that awaits them. Phuket is especially acclaimed for its seafood, southern specialties such as curries with coconut milk, and the fantastic range of fresh fruits available here. For lunch, forget burgers, sandwiches, and chicken nuggets. Thailand has food that arrives just as fast but is much fresher and tastier such as Kway Tio (noodle soup), Pad Thai Goong (Thai fried rice noodles with prawns), Pad Kapow Neua (stir-fried basil with beef), Pad See Iew (noodles in soy sauce), and Kao Pad (fried rice with a choice of meat or seafood). One other “must try” while you’re in Phuket is Kao Niow with Gai Yang (sticky rice with barbecued chicken). Aside from the local food, you can find a range from Italian to Middle Eastern to Indian and Japanese cuisine. In addition, wine has become readily available with some restaurants now featuring creditable wine cellars. Places to eat vary from road¬side noodle stalls, air-conditioned restaurants, open air restaurants with great views, or fast food out¬lets. You won’t go hungry!

Have you ever met someone and thought instantly to yourself, “Wow, you definitely cannot be trusted”? Only a few brief statements need to be exchanged and you immediately know the guy standing in front of you is a sly, cunning, smooth talker. They have a certain air about them that exudes cockiness and self-indulgence. However, at the same time, you can’t help but to find yourself intrigued by this person. Ladies, do not succumb to the curiosity. Run!
Easier said than done, I understand. These boys are usually annoyingly good looking. On top of their appealing exterior they are exceedingly charming. They subtly flirt with you while simultaneously poking fun at you so you walk away from the conversation, no matter how long it is, wondering if he was actually interested or just being a jerk. Let me clarify this puzzling mystery for you: he is a jerk. There is no question about it. He is just covering up his vileness with a debonair exterior.
Don’t get sucked into the vortex that is this type of guy. I get it; they blur your sense of control and common sense with their peculiar ways. It’s almost as if they temporarily disconnect the logical part of your brain and replace it with mush. There is no possible way to be friends with this person. Once you’ve caught their interest, there’s not stopping them. You’re probably thinking to yourself, what an idiot, just ignore the guy and problem solved. So wrong my friends. 
You cannot simply ignore the guy. You can even go as far to be blatantly mean in your responses to his numerous advances (because trust me, he’s not going anywhere). He will just take this as you playing hard to get and keep on flirting. He will most likely laugh when you become fuming mad at his constant making fun of you, sometimes rendering you absolutely speechless.
If you find that you cannot help yourself (as many females can¬not because we want to believe that we can turn the jerks into the good guys that they will never be) you will end up chasing them. They pull the switch on you. As soon as they realize that they’ve got you, they start ignoring you a little bit at a time so you’re the one calling and texting. But when you see them in person they are just as charming as ever, further messing with your head.
There really is no good outcome to this situation. It’s going to end up with you realizing that this guy honestly sucks and being heartbroken because you couldn’t turn him into your prince charming like you had originally planned. Well ladies, you’ve been warned. If you sense that this person is an ignoramus from the start, stay away. It’s not worth the head-ache it will inevitably cause you.

As Election Day approaches, we repeatedly hear the names Mitt Romney and Barack Obama being mentioned in the media. Their proposed policies have spread like wildfire to the ears of the citizens of the nation; and so have the names Joseph R. Biden, Dem. and Paul D. Ryan, Rep.
Although the Vice President contenders aren’t stirring up as much controversy as in 2008, when Sarah Palin was the Vice Presidential candidate for the Republican Party, Romney’s choice of Ryan as his running mate was a bold decision. As Nate Silver wrote in a New York Times article in August 2012: “[Ryan] is also more conservative than any Democratic nominee was liberal.”
Paul D. Ryan, who is 42 years old, is currently serving his seventh term as U.S. Congressman for Wisconsin’s first congressional district. He is the Chairman of the House Bud-get Committee, where he works to bring fiscal discipline and accountability to the federal government, and the House Ways and Means Committee, where he claims to work on simplifying the tax code and making healthcare more affordable and accessible for Americans.
As a Congressman, Ryan has made a variety of proposals in his “Path to Prosperity Budget,” that he claims can cut spending by $5 trillion dollars if passed. In his budget, he discusses taxes, debts, healthcare, spending, national security, size of government and deficits. He states that he would cut spending and repeal the President’s current healthcare plan by ‘taking power away from the government and put patients in control.’
But, according to FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, Ryan “accused President Obama’s healthcare law of funneling money away from Medicare at the expense of the elderly. When in fact, Medicare’s chief actuary says the law substantially improves the system’s finances, and Ryan himself has embraced the same savings.”
On the other hand, Joseph Biden, who is 69 years old and the current Vice President, is running for a second term with President Obama. Biden began his political career as a council member for Delaware’s New Castle County Council, shortly after graduating from law school. Then, at the age 29, Biden became the one of the youngest people elected into the United States Senate, according to the White House official website, WhiteHouse.gov. Biden is a U.S. Senator representing Delaware for 36 years, Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 years, and has been recognized for his work on criminal justice issues such as the Violence Against Women Act, as well as foreign policy.
Biden’s plan for America was shown when he worked with President Obama to implement the American Recovery and Re¬investment Act, also known as the stimulus bill, worth $787 billion dollars in February of 2009. This law was passed in order to save the country from its financial burdens, a similar goal to Ryan’s proposed budget.
But, many Republicans, who claim that it failed, have scrutinized the stimulus law. Yet, according to an article in the New York Times updated in March 2012, “Republicans have derided the 2009 stimulus as a failure, the consensus among economists has been that it helped stave off deeper job losses and sup¬ported a modest recovery.”
The depths of discussion of Vice Presidential candidates and economic policies have only scratched the surface. To hear more about the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, tune into the First Presidential Debate on Wednesday, October 3rd at 9 p.m. and the Vice Presidential Debate on Thursday, October 11th at 9 p.m. Because the Vice President is one step away from the Oval Office if any¬thing should happen to the President, we must research carefully and be fully informed about both the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates when we vote on November 6th. For more information concerning the truth about both political parties and the policies they propose, please visit FactCheck.org or, Pulitzer Prize winning, Politifact.com. The choice is ours. Vote 2012

Fall is upon us. Halloween is right around the corner. Scantily clad pirates, football-players-turned-zombies, and ghoulish college professors will become a normal thing for that small window of time that we endure every year. But we have a bit of sand left in the hourglass left before that transformation is complete. What are we to do as we wait? Why not watch some pulpy horror flicks? 
Let’s start with a word we all (kidding) love: vampires. These pale-skinned blood-sucking folk have endured decades of change. There are countless variations of vampires in movies ranging from the sparkling Cullen to gore-loving monsters. With that in mind here are tops picks for the genre. 
Let the Right One In (2008) is a Swedish story (yes, it has subtitles) and refreshing take on the genre, chronicling the relationship between a bullied little boy named Oscar and his newfound love, a girl named Eli who happens to be a vicious killer and vampire. Filled with mystery and lots of blood, this movie definitely stands out for its characters, who are darkly written into a world of long nights and strange romance. If you don’t have the patience for subtitles (shame on you!) there is also an American remake Let Me In (2010). 
Other notable mentions for the vampire genre are revolutionary oldies such as Nosferatu (1922), Dracula (1931), and Vampyr (1932). Those akin to modern fare may enjoy Cronos (1993), Daybreakers (2009), or 30 Days of Night (2007) as well as franchise starters Under¬world (2003) and Blade (1998). 
The «slasher» genre essentially started with the staccato strings and chocolate syrup blood of Alfred Hitchcock›s Psycho (1960) but lives (or kills?) on today as a somewhat spotty platform for cheap thrills. That being said there are also some interesting slasher fish in the sea of blood (mostly from college students on road trips, yikes!). Several films that defined the slasher, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Halloween (1978), and My Bloody Valentine (1981) maintain remakes and sequels galore. Check out the old versions before you write off these titles, you may be surprised. Recent films of interest include The Strangers (2008), Last House on the Left (2009), and the genre-bending Cabin in the Woods (2012). 
Ghost flicks include Insidious (2010), The Others (2001) and the mystery-thriller The Sixth Sense (1999) in it’s roster. Poltergeist (1982), The Shining (1980), and the original Amityville Horror (1979) paved the way for the paranormal, while foreign forces like The Orphanage (2004) from Spain send chills from across the Atlantic.

As college students, we do not always have the kind of disposable income required to drop $100 on a lipstick like our favorite celebrities. However, that does not mean that we should have to sacrifice quality for price. As a matter of fact, I have encountered many drugstore makeup products that are far better than their high-end counterparts. After an extensive amount of research, ahem…watching an excessive amount of YouTube beauty videos and spending a ridiculous amount of money trying things out, I have painstakingly created an everyday makeup routine, of drug¬store makeup only, for under $40.
Foundation: My all-time favorite drug¬store foundation is Revlon’s ColorStay makeup ($11.99 at Ulta). This foundation is available in two different formulas based on your personal skin type: combination/oily or normal/dry. This foundation feels very lightweight but it has a buildable coverage to hide virtually any imperfections. Another great feature of this foundation is the wide color range that suits virtually every person’s skin tone.
Concealer: My pick for concealer is e.l.f.’s Essential Tone Correcting Concealer ($1 at Target). Not only does this concealer cover even the most stubborn of blemishes, but it also camouflages and brightens dark under eye circles. This is perfect for those of us who want to look a little more awake for those dreaded 8:00 a.m. classes.
Powder: Using powder after foundation and concealer increases the staying-power of your makeup, provides further coverage, and reduces shininess. If you have dry skin, you may want to skip this step, but if you have oily skin, you will love me forever! I highly recommend Rimmel’s Stay Matte Pressed Powder ($4.99 at Ulta) in either translucent or the color of your skin tone. Simply dust some on with a fluffy brush and you are good to go.
Blush/Bronzer/Eye Shadow: This was the biggest challenge for me when I devised this makeup routine. Eyes Lips Face (e.l.f.) is a very inexpensive cosmetics brand found in Target. In some cases, you get what you pay for, but in this case, with the e.l.f. Studio Contouring Blush and Bronzing Powder com¬pact, you are getting impressive quality at an affordable price. You could use this as three steps in one. First, sweep some of the blush onto the apples, or tops, of your cheeks. Next, dust the bronzer on your cheek bones, your temples, and your chin creating a sunkissed glow. Finally, pop some of the bronzer on the crease of your eyelids as you would an eye shadow to add some dimension! 
Mascara: I believe that Mascara is very important because it really defines and accentuates your eyes. My mascara of choice, Almay’s Get Up and Grow mascara ($6.99 at Target) is a recent addition to my own make¬up routine. Even though my eyelashes are below average, this mascara makes me look like I actually have nice ones. It is a very dark black formula and does not clump. Blink your eyes over the mascara wand then wiggle from root to tip to create the perfect look.
Lip Gloss: The world is your oyster when it comes to drugstore lip products. Being that this is supposed to be an everyday makeup routine, I wanted to keep it simple with a nice lip gloss. My recommendation is NYX’s Mega Shine Lip Gloss ($5.49 at Ulta). However, you really can¬not go wrong with any NYX lip products. This gloss is not sticky or goopy. It effortlessly glides on to wear by itself or over your favorite lipstick.
Drum roll, please…the final total for this routine is $38.45 plus tax. There you have it, ladies…a full face of makeup and all for under $40. Enjoy!

Fall means more than back to school and falling leaves: It’s time for new and returning TV shows. Colder temperatures are the perfect excuse to curl up under a blanket in front of the television. Here is a glimpse of some new series to check out, from reviews and channel websites online:

Men Respecting All Women and Women Appreciating Real Men (MRAW and WARM) organization’s Toy Drive, in Hillwood Commons September 25 to 27, collected money and toys as donations for the children at St. Jude’s Research Hospital. 
“We wanted to give something back to the community,” said senior Psychology major and president of the club, Angela Calise. The mission was to make kids happy, and raise awareness around the club and the cause among students on campus, according to MRAW & WARM member Ivanna Fortunato, a junior Digital Arts and Design major. 
This wasn’t the first Toy Drive hosted by MRAW and WARM. The last one, in 2010, collected toys for the same organization. After student feedback, this year’s toy drive welcomed money donations as well. Ac¬cording to MRAW and WARM members Beatriz Vacaela and Alba Rodriguez, a lot of students wanted to help last time, but they didn’t have toys to bring. “This year they are able to give money, and then we´ll go out and buy the toys,” they explained. 
The organization was happy with the outcome, and hopes to make it a monthly drive, so more students will have an opportunity to donate. “We definitely will make a difference in a child’s day when they receive a toy unexpectedly,” Calise said. 
The MRAW and WARM organization aims to help everyone, throughout the year – not only during holidays. The club focuses on respect and appreciation for all people, both men and women. “This year we wanted to start out early, so we can help as many as possible,” Calise said. “I think a lot of students see us as a feminist club, but we are not,” she said. “We just want to help people.” 
The MRAW and WARM weekly meetings have a regular attendance of around 15 students, but Calise said that there are a lot more people involved in the club. For students who want to contribute with donations, or join the organization, send an e-mail to mraw.warm@gmail.com, or at¬tend their meetings Wednesdays at 12:30 p.m., in Hillwood Commons room 114.

LIU Post has been recognized as one of the top 15 percent of military friendly colleges in the nation for the third time by G.I. jobs. LIU Brooklyn also made the list, which can be found at www.militaryfriendlyschools.com. 
G.I. Jobs sends out surveys or questionnaires to see how United States colleges are servicing their veteran students. 
“For us to be identified [as being military friendly], it’s a real honor to say the least because other schools are not in the top 15 percent,” said Adam Grohman, Veteran and Military Affairs Coordinator for LIU Post. 
Post’s participation in the Yellow Ribbon program is one way that the school stands out by being military friendly. There is a cap on the amount of money the government gives to a veteran student attending a private university. Veterans who have served a minimum of 36 months of active duty service after September 10, 2001 are eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program at Post. The Yellow Ribbon program works with the veteran’s assistance program to help finance the rest of the tuition for veterans who are eligible for the full percentage of the G.I bill, along with their dependents, that the government doesn’t cover. Many schools have Yellow Ribbon programs with their own rules and regulations. 
“We are very open with our yellow ribbon program and we are very supportive of it,” Grohman said. Grohman stated that the faculty and staff play a large role in making the campus military friendly. He said he works with the approximately 103 students (including veterans, veteran dependents and people working in the reserve) who use veteran’s education entitlements at the college and has seen the faculty and staff working well with the veteran students. For example, if a veteran student wanted to take three credits over the summer and nothing was available in their department, the chair and faculty would work with the student to find them a solution. 
“I’ve been to three different schools and by far this one was the easiest to assimilate to because Adam [Grohman] is a particular person to go to handle all your needs, versus having six or three different agencies and you have to go and figure it out…that made it 10 times easier to facilitate me coming here,” said Charlie Taylor, veteran graduate student. 
Taylor had some “feelings of alienation” when he first came back from Afghanistan. He said that he was older than many other students in his classes and was used to different responsibilities and cultural norms. He refers to the change as a “culture shock” because, according to Taylor, “ [when] the culture is a little bit different than what you’re used to you’re going to have to figure out what people are all about, figure out what makes everyone tick, and adapt to the social norms.”
Taylor feels that transitioning from the military to college is like a career change or a lifestyle change—and sometimes even both. He adjusted to the change by getting involved on campus by joining clubs with other veterans because they understand what one another is going through. The first club he joined was the Vets Club at Suffolk County Community College, where he started after his homecoming from the military. 
“It’s an awesome program. I think it is incredibly military friendly,” Taylor said about Post’s veteran assistance program. Taylor said that it may be helpful if there was a veteran guidance counselor because “many times we get a little more comfortable talking to a vet.”
Post has a club called Veteran Students United (VSU), consisting of veterans, members of the military and non-veterans. Grohman said that it “is a vibrant group of students.” The club hosts an activity called Veteran’s Appreciation Week every November, which coincides with Veteran’s Day. 
“What it does for me person¬ally because I’m an alumni to Post as well, it really makes me want to say what is it that we can do to be even better…If anything I think it raises the bar and it also means that we have to continue to look for ways that we can remain in that top percentage,” Grohman said. 
VSU is a club that is great for all students, not just veterans alone. Many students studying for careers in social work take advantage of the club so they can learn how to speak with and help veteran students. If you are interested in taking part in supporting the transition for veterans to LIU Post, join the VSU club on Wednesdays during Common Hour.

Do you know where your bottles and cans go on campus?
You toss that soda can or water bottle into the recycling bin and you feel pretty good about doing your part for the Earth, right? But have you ever thought of where it goes after that?
The recycling bins that you see around campus are maintained and staffed by members of the LIU Post Recycling Program. These students work as Environmental Assistants. They are in charge of sorting and cleaning all of the bottles and cans that get tossed into their assigned recycling bins. They are then picked up by our Facilities Services Department and brought to a central location where they are stored until our carter, Jamaica Ash, comes to pick it up.
But did you know that New York is a “bottle bill” state and most cans and bottles have a 5 cent deposit on it that you can redeem at a grocery store like Pathmark? The Environmental Assistants separate these bottles from the rest of the non-deposit recyclables and these get taken to Pathmark and cashed in. All of the money that is raised from the LIU Post Recycling Program then goes into a scholarship fund.
Since 2010, the recycling program has been raising money for the scholarship. In April of 2011, the program awarded $250 to the winner of a Sustainable Essay Competition. In April of 2012, the program awarded $600 to the winner of a Sustainable Creative Expressions Contest. That was a result of recycling exactly 17,000 bottles and cans.
Please help the LIU Post Recycling Program beat last year’s amount by recycling all of your cans and bottles. After all, it might just be YOU that wins the scholarship this year in April of 2013. For any questions regarding the scholarship or the recycling program, you can contact Raheem Barnes at LIUPostRecycling@gmail.com

At the end of May, the Facilities Department and WCWP, the campus radio station, worked together to put a ramp at the front entrance of the WCWP building, making the radio station handicap accessible. 
According to Frank Gallow, Trades Manager of the Facilities Department, it was necessary to install the ramp because the station has a handicapped student enrolled for classes this fall. During its 47 years of being on the campus, this is the first time the building has ever had the need for a handicap ramp. The project started around the end of last spring semester and was completed by the start of the first summer season. 
According to William Kirker, Director of Facilities, the ramp cost approximately $15,000 to construct and the funding came from the LIU Post Facilities maintenance bud¬get. “We continually evaluate ways to improve access for people with disabilities to all campus facilities,” said Kirker. “The campus consists of more than 50 building with hundreds of entrances, and bringing them all into ADA compliance at the same time would be prohibitively expensive. We strive to prioritize.” 
The American Disabilities Act, ADA, is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person’s disability and that includes entrances to buildings. The act, unfortunately, did not come into effect until 1990, 25 years after the radio station was built. 
In recent years, accessibility ramps have been built at the Great Hall, Riggs Hall, Nassau Hall, Kings Hall and Queens Hall,” Kirker continued. 
“The front of the building looks amazing,” says Director and Manager of WCWP Dan Cox. “We actually had the student as an intern while he was in high school. The way he would enter was through the side emergency door which is at ground level.” 
When the student, Charlie Moerler, a freshman electronic journalism major, decided to enroll full time at LIU Post, his parents made a request for the ramp, and it was constructed within the semester. “I think [the ramp] makes my life so much easier,” said Moerler. “All the other buildings are really accessible too.” 
Professor Maura Bernard, who has been teaching at the radio station since 2005, has been suffering with a disc problem in her back for almost two years now. Bernard has to have the assistance of a cane and found it a bit difficult accessing the building until the ramp was put in place. 
“The radio station was never one of those buildings you couldn’t get into if you were handicapped,” said Professor Bernard. The emergency exit at the east entrance is at ground level, so for certain cases the secretary would disarm the exit and you can enter that way. “We always knew the ramp was in the works… It just makes it that much easier, it gives you more independence.” 
There are other buildings on campus that are still not fully handicap accessible, including the Little Theater. According to Heather Drastal, General Manager of Post Theater Company, they want nothing more than to update the facility and to improve accessibility. 
“There have been a few instances where I was called in advance and we were able to accommodate disabled patrons in the theatre, but the bathrooms are definitely not currently accessible, and the University is definitely aware of that,” said Drastal. “In fact, I’ve been informed that the Little Theatre is on the University’s building refurbishment list… My hope is that our building is coming up in the queue. In the interim, I try to offer the best solutions possible to disabled patrons who want to come see performances!”

We may only be one month into the fall semester, but spring registration begins on Monday, October 15. For an optimal schedule, William Polaski, Senior Associate Director of Academic and Career Planning, encourages students to plan ahead and register online. 
“I always do it online only because it’s easier. Once registration starts, I make my schedule so I can get all the classes I want to get into,” says junior public relations major Michael Lagreca. 
One of the benefits of being able to register early for the spring semester is to be able to see how your personal and class schedule will be next semester. Polaski explained that early registration helps the academic departments as well: “There’s also an advantage to doing it early in that departments know how many students are registered for courses so if a cancellation happens, it can happen sooner rather than later so people have time to adjust.” 
For that reason, senior criminal justice major Brian Rojas sees a benefit in registering for classes later. “I think it’s better to register later in the semester only so I don’t have to deal with cancelled classes and re-do my entire schedule to fit one class.” 
If you decide to head to Kumble Hall right now, chances are you’re going to be given an appointment with your advisor pretty late in the fall semester. There are only 15 full time advisors in the Academic and Career Planning department and their schedules fill up quickly. Before online registration was available, registering for classes was early enough so every student had a chance to meet with their advisor. Polaski thus advised that students should make their schedules online through their My LIU Student Center and go to an advisor afterwards to make sure that the schedule will lead towards graduation. 
Polaski recommends that students check the academic requirements page and check the school’s website to figure out what classes to take for their major. The academic requirements page shows you all the classes you’ve already taken and how many more credits you need to graduate. Each department’s website has its own degree requirements that you need to fulfill in order to get a degree. They tell you how many credits you need and the GPA you must maintain. 
The program of study is an overview of your major and the typical sequence of your classes for the next four to five years. The Academics and Career planning website (www.liu.edu/cwpost.academic.aspx) offers information for the degree requirements, program of studies and course descriptions for you to compare to the “Academic Requirements” page on you’re My LIU Student Center account. 
Registering early for your spring classes online is one way to make sure you get into the classes you want. Senior education major Jacqueline Klingler does exactly that: “There have been too many times where I don’t get the schedule I want or I end up taking a class I don’t really need so now I make sure I meet with my advisor to make sure I’m on the right path towards graduating.” Advisors are there to plot and plan your road to a successful path towards graduation. 
To make an appointment with your advisor, call 516-299-2746. If you don’t know who your counselor is, visit the Academic and Career Planning website: www.liu.edu/CWPost/StudentLife/Services/Counseling.aspx. The office hours are Monday through Thursday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Dr. Reginald Gale Ross joined LIU Post on June 11th as Associate Provost/Dean of Admissions. Ross says he replaced Ms. Joanne Graziano as Assistant Provost for Admissions. Graziano is now Associate Provost for Student Financial Services. Ross says he is currently wearing three hats, Dean and temporarily in charge of freshmen and International Students until he finds a replacement. David Follick, who was the Director of Freshmen Admissions, left for a job at St. John’s University. Ross is currently looking for one person to be the director of both freshmen and International Students. “My role is to make sure the processes are working the way they should be, if they’re not, I fix it,” Dr. Ross said. The Dean of Admissions have to come up with ways to get students interested in their university, analyze many statistics on students attending their university and those who leave and make sure the entire admissions department is running smoothly. He says he oversees a staff of about fifty workers in admissions. Ross has set goals and plans to improve enrollment.
Dr. Ross explained his plan of specific steps get students interested in attending LIU Post. “The idea is to continue to shape the enrollment by admitting students who are likely to succeed here,” he said. Dr. Ross hopes that this plan will be active by mid-October. “The first role is evaluating and improving the business plan,” Ross said. He says he think this plan will make a huge difference and will be less work for advisers. “Make sure we connect with students here who intend to get their degree here,” he said.
The steps to the plan to get freshmen interested in Post are as followed. Dr. Ross says they sell Post’s wonderful campus life by using different channels such as the LIU website, print materials, walk-ins, open house, transfer events, admissions fairs and high school visits. The next step, which is all done online, is the inquiry acknowledgement letter which includes the student’s personal counselor’s information, a view book and an invitation to apply, said Ross. “The idea is to respond back as quickly as we can, not answer but acknowledgement to personalize the relationship,” he said. The financial aid information and fact sheet is next, Ross said. 
The students now have to respond either yes or no to the invitation to apply. If they respond yes and complete the common application, they get an online confirmation right away, said Ross. After one day, they receive an acknowledgment letter and after two days they receive an email from their personal counselor, he said. The counselors will see if the student completed the check list to apply and see if they qualify for any scholarships. A postcard, stating that if the student ever wants to apply in the future to contact LIU Admissions, is sent to the students who reply no to the application invitation, Ross says. 
He says there is a ton of analysis and statistics involved in his work since each area of students’ application process are different. Freshmen, transfer, international and graduate students, all experience a different application process with specific requirements. 
Dr. Ross also has plans for years into the future. He said he is creating a strategic enrollment management plan this year which is a three year plan. Ross says Post currently does not have one and that this plan is critical. “The entire campus has to be involved, Admissions, Recreation and ISS, to make solid predictions what the campus will look like in the future,” said Ross. Hopefully, the predictions are close to the target, he says. This plan evolves the development of new academic programs and students will be recruited for the strategic enrollment management plan, Ross said. 
Dr. Ross was born in Charleston, South Carolina and moved every year until his second year of high school when he settled into New Orleans for high school and at Xavier University in New Orleans. He said he while in college he commuted but he then moved to New Jersey to live on campus while as a graduate student. Ross said he attended Stevens Institute of Technology where he completed his Masters of Science and Ph.D. in Applied Industrial / Organizational Psychology.
Before working at Post, Dr. Ross worked at three other colleges: Bloomfield College, Montclair University, and Coppin State University. Ross was Associate Professor of Psychology and Associate Vice President for Enrollment Services at Bloomfield College located in Bloom¬field, New Jersey. Ross was Dean of Enrollment Management and Retention Services at Montclair State University located in Montclair, New Jersey. His most recent job was Vice President for Enrollment Management at Coppin State University located in Baltimore, Maryland. He was also a teacher in Industrial Organization Psychology for eleven years before that. Dr. Ross now teaches College 101 at Post. “It (Teaching) makes you feel good, makes you feel like you were part of their journey,” Ross said. 
He says he loves working on a college campus because he gets to see important bench¬marks in people’s lives all the time. “The person you are the day you first walk in (to college) and 15 weeks later, is a completely different person, much more confidant,” Ross said. 
Dr. Ross said that when he interviewed at Post in April, he picked up a copy of the Pioneer. He says that he likes the fact that Post has an active newspaper. He says his past universities he worked at struggled with keeping an active newspaper. Ross said the amount of students at Post is the perfect size because it is right in the middle. “Post is an interesting place, I want to learn more about its history and have an official tour with the campus historian,” said Ross. He says he picked Post because he wanted to be close to his house in New Jersey and he liked the beautiful campus. 
Ross has an apartment in Port Washing¬ton and goes home to New Jersey for his wife, Joanie, every weekend. They do not have any children. Ross says he likes Port Washington and Brookville because the scenery of nature and trees remind him of his home in New Jersey. “LIU is the greenest campus I ever been on its beautiful, also the biggest campus I ever been on,” said Dr. Ross. 
He says that his co-workers have been very welcoming. “Folks over here in Mullarkey Hall have been the best, very helpful and very unafraid,” Ross said. Ross spends 65% of his time at work in meetings and he says it really stresses him out at times. He has many tasks to complete and little free time. “It’s nice to have a nice, normal, everyday conversation with people, it takes the stress away,” said Ross. His weekly work schedule is booked up with meetings, briefings, conferences, meetings over lunch, class and his cabinet meeting, when all Directors and Associate Directors that report to Dr. Ross meet.
“I’m looking forward to a very fruitful, productive, busy semester; I think it will be a good one,” said Dr. Ross.
