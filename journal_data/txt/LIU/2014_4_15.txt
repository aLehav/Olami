On March 22, 1994, grunge bands and commercial pop artists sat comfortably on the Billboard Top 200, the American music industry’s chart standard for album popularity. Mariah Carey, Nirvana, Boyz II Men, and Pearl Jam were all enjoying popular releases that year. Kurt Cobain killed the popularity of ‘80s heavy metal with the release of “Smells like Teen Spirit,” and the metal genre itself was just “uncool.”
However, there was one, hardworking band from Texas that refused to lean toward accessible alternative aesthetics, Pantera, and that year they released a record that would withstand the test of time.
“A kind of aesthetics of thud… the real art smolders in the noise itself,” an excerpt read from Rolling Stone’s May 19, 1994 issue, reviewing Pantera’s seventh album, “Far Beyond Driven.” Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars, and it is considered to be the most extreme record to reach number one on the Billboard 200.
Twenty years after their release in 1994, the group is defunct due to the fact that their guitarist, Dimebag Darrell, was tragically shot and killed on December 8, 2004, at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio. But the band’s legacy lives on, along with their influence.
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of their milestone record, the remaining members of the band reissued the album with a double disc set on March 25. One disc includes the original 12-song track list, and the other is a live CD that was recorded at the now famous “Monsters Of Rock” festival in 1994 at Donington Park, England. In an interview last month with Rolling Stone regarding the album, Vinnie Paul, the band’s drummer, said they played 312 concerts that year – a testament to their work ethic.
Much like the two previous albums, “Far Beyond Driven” followed Pantera’s similar formula. They bust out mind-numbing, groove-based guitar licks; combined with their thundering rhythm section comprised of bassist Rex Brown, mix it with machine gun-like
drumming by Vinnie Paul, and have vocalist Philip H. Anselmo use his hardcore influenced vocals to create almost an hour of in-your-face, heavy metal.
Three of the albums’ four singles are fan favorites, all of which became live set staples. “I’m Broken,” is a bluesy number, with Dime’s signature low e-string chugging, and a steady-paced head-banging chorus that is sure to get stuck in your head.
The next single, “Planet Caravan,” was a Black Sabbath cover off of their “Paranoid” album. The cover can be seen as a curve ball for fans, but it serves as a well-deserved break from an album that’s the furthest thing from being tame, and gives the song a nice, southern feel.
“5 Minutes Alone,” is a song you want to get up and mosh to: in the car, at a hockey game, at the library, anywhere. The song was written in response to an altercation that occurred at a concert before the recording of the CD. The incident involved a fan that kept flipping the bird to the stage. Apparently, he wasn’t satisfied with the performance, even though, according to Paul, there were 18,000 screaming fans enjoying the gig. Ultimately, rabid, but faithful, Pantera-fans gave the guy a beating. Lawsuits came next and the band wrote a killer song.
“Becoming,” the bands final single from the record, is a crowd- pleaser, filled with Dimebag’s screeching whammy pedal and Paul’s legendary heavily triggered kick drum pattern. Paul and Dimebag just steadily jam this one through and work their magic.
To this day, metal-heads still blast the record and understand its importance, even at our LIU Post campus. Chris Maffei, class of 2013 Post graduate and production director of the WCWP radio station, commented on the seminal album. “It’s a case where the cream rises to the top. It’s groundbreaking, and it couldn’t have happened to a better band at the time.” Maffei continued, “It looks like a greatest hits album, but it’s not.”

On April 11, 12, and 13, the Post Theater Company premiered their new production, “Out Loud: The First Year Showcase,” at the Little Theater Main Stage. In the production, first-year theatre majors at Post were able to demonstrate their skills – and boy, did they impress. 
To start off, there were obviously flaws. No production is perfect. Some scenes either dragged on, had a lack of direction, weak characters and writing, and surprisingly shaky acting. However, the positives were able to rip through to make the production as a whole, great. 
LIU Post has some ridiculous talent. One shining star, Emily Locklear, gave the best performance of the show, with a dark tale about the redundant and depressing world. It was absolutely beautiful: the haunting, powerful, and all-out performance given. She has a talent that might not be topped, and she most definitely will be on stage accepting an award some day. Along with Emily, other great performances included Emily Ann Banks, Michael Luka, Victoria Giambalvo, and Max Radel. 
In terms of scenes, there were some that seemed to just be fillers, including the finale, which was an “artsy” tale of empowerment, and having a voice that had the full company. However, there was a great mix of comedy and drama. The highlight was Just Another Day from the musical, “Next to Normal.” It had such a powerful presence and was goose bump-worthy.
Actors Olivia Lodge and Robbie McGrath proved to have great timing, which is the key to comedy. They give a great laugh and truly make their characters their own, especially Lodge who has a very strong stage presence. 
It’s amazing how one show can demonstrate what an incredible group of actors we have on campus. This show was something not to miss out on, and with these actors present on campus, future shows will be brilliant. A single show has never been so pleasing. 
There is one complaint though – tuition at Post is quite, quite expensive and the lack of microphones for the showcase was unacceptable. How are we not able to afford essential equipment for this department?

From Billy Joel to Brand New, the Long Island music scene has generated a huge fan base that flocks to concerts nearly every month for their respected artists.
In the public’s search for venues, some people may have been to the well-known theatres like Nikon at Jones Beach Theater and The Paramount, while others trek out to smaller gigs, such as the 89 Music Venue or Vibe Lounge. However, on Saturday, April 12, a homecoming show for Long Island natives Iron Chic played at the unique “DIY” venue called The Wood Shop.
For those unfamiliar with the term, a “DIY” stands for “do-it- yourself.” Located in Copaigue, The Wood Shop gets its name from the building in which bands play inside – it is a literal wood shop. Kitchen furnishings are littered along the corridors; the walls are decorated with wood samples, and the entrance to where the bands play is behind a thick showroom curtain.
Upon entering the DIY venue, the one major question that may have been on minds of those first seeing The Wood Shop: where is
the stage? Decorated with Christmas lights, a large “The Wood Shop” banner, and reflective letters hung from the ceiling, which read “AWWW YEAH,” the kitschy DIY created its own version of a stage by illuminating a crevice of the room.
The first few bands to play, Per Capita, Scout, and Haverford, drew a minimal crowd. Taking inspiration from the bands Title Fight and Tigers Jaw, the openers sadly left the audience in a lulled state of being – no jumping, no excitement, nothing.
Somerset Thrower, the openers to Iron Chic, managed to spark some interest, but much of the crowd’s concern belonged to the Long Island punk royalty. Sweaty and unapologetic, Jason Lubrano, lead singer of Iron Chic, commanded the 500-square foot room and belted out “Cutesy Monster Man,” off their previous album, “Not Like This.”
After coming home from their debut-record’s tour, the crowd seemed pleasantly surprised by the lack of “The Constant One,” as they played merely two songs. The entire set list comprised of early LP’s, and mostly “Not Like This” kept the crowd alive as everyone in the room swayed, head-banged, and jumped their way towards the band.
Iron Chic ended on a high note with “Time Keeps On Slipping Into The (Cosmic) Future,” and the crowd bellowed tremendously, leaving the sound to reverb through the walls and out into the streets. Iron Chic is set to tour the UK from the end of April to the end of May. If you follow the Long Island punk scene, this was surely a homecoming that was not to be missed.

During an offensive onslaught in the first 30 minutes of action, senior attacker Jackie Sileo amassed eight of her nine points (2 G, 7 A). After outscoring Molloy 12-0 in the first half, the no. 1 ranked Pioneers would go on and secure an 18-4 victory on Saturday, April 5th, at Hickox Field in Brookville, N.Y.

Sileo played pitch and catch with freshman midfielder/defender Cara Douglas early on as they teamed up on a pair of goals. The
Green and Gold had another dominant showing as they outshot their opposition, 33-13. After commencing the later stanza with a 6-1 run, the Pioneers (12-0) took an 18-1 lead and sealed the deal with the Lions (6- 5).
Senior attacker Samantha Losco had another strong performance, posting a five-point outing (4 G, 1 A). Freshman attacker Stefani Vagelatos, and senior attacker Morgan Chiarenza collected four points apiece. Senior midfielder Katie Rotan tallied up three points (2 G, 1 A) along with six ground balls.
The Pioneers played with great discipline and never slowed down on both ends of the field. Junior defender Kali Maxwell won six draw controls and forced one turnover, while freshman midfielder Connor Bird picked up five draw controls. Senior goalies Katie Hannan and Renee Schwartz totaled seven stops for the Green and Gold between the pipes. Their counterparts, Caroline Winters and Laura Vetter, made 12 combined saves for the Lions.
Led by head coach Meghan McNamara, the Pioneers would continue the damage as they decimated Bridgeport 18-3 on Wednesday at Hickox Field in Brookville, N.Y. The top-ranked Pioneers jumped ahead to another quick start, converting on all five of their first five shots within the first seven minutes of the play. LIU Post (13-0) established the
tempo of the game from the opening draw by mauling the defense of the Purple Knights (1-11) with a 27-3 advantage in shots by halftime to go along with a 13-1 lead.
The Green and Gold shone around the lights of Sileo, who led the charge with 11 points, recording season-high eight assists. Sileo
also recorded three goals to add to her total. Senior Morgan Chiarenza racked up four points (3 G,1 A), and Losco continued her impressive season tacking on two goals and three assists, giving her a career-high 56 points for the season. Sophmore midfielder/defender Honey Roche also chipped in, scoring her first goal of the season at the 23:50 mark during the second half. The Pioneers continued to demonstrate their balanced attack, as ten players had at least one point.
Overall, the Pioneers were just as stellar defensively by controlling the game on both sides of the ball. Communication was key defensively, as senior defender Melissa Rohr, senior goalie Katie Hannan, and senior midfielder Katie Rotan helped the Pioneers in forcing 20 turnovers. In addition, the Pioneers won the ground ball battle (24-11), dominated on draw controls (15-8), and shots (38- 9). Bridgeport goalie Megan Carney collected 14 saves in the cage.
After the game, Sileo mentioned that her teammates helped her a lot in becoming the NCAA›s all-time leading scorer across all divisions. The majority of Sileo›s points have came from assists, which goes to show how hard-working her teammates are who helped her achieve this milestone. Sileo also said that in order to win the East Coast Conference, the Pioneers will have to stay hungry and play with intensity for the entire 60 minutes. Sileo is continuing to enjoy her success as she hopes her and her fellow seniors go out with another national championship.

On Saturday, April 12, the Pioneers met their match after the team endured a nine-hour bus journey to take on Mercyhurst University at Tullio Field, in Erie, (P.A.). Despite junior midfielder Connor Drost scoring a game-best five points off the bench, the number 11 ranked Pioneers (6-4) narrowly fell to the number four ranked Lakers (8-2), with a final score of 9-7.
In spite of the end result, the game provided 60 minutes of sheer excitement. Tied 1-1 at the end of the first quarter, the Lakers scored three unanswered goals, two of which occurred in a 45-second stint, to kick start the second period. Senior attack man Brandon Thomson capped the spurt for the hosts with a man-up tally at the 8:57 mark.
However, the Pioneers reeled off three goals of their own to conclude the second half, and went into the second intermission tied at 4-all. Sophomore midfielder, Anthony Berardis, bookended the run with goals, while sophomore attack man Matty Beccaris sandwiched it with a marker on the extra-man opportunity.
The Ping-Pong action between the two teams resumed in the third quarter before Mercyhurst, which maintained a dominant 17-of- 20 (85 percent) on face-offs, pulled away in the fourth period. During the final 15-minute stanza, the players on the host team scored goals, keeping LIU Post off the scoreboard. Green and Gold did, however, manage three shots on net, but the Lakers’ senior goaltender Michael Grace – who made an impressive eight saves throughout the game – stopped each of the attempts.
Additionally, Berardis notched a hat trick during the play. Senior attack man/midfielder Connor Mackay, along with junior attack man Chris Caiazza, chipped in a goal apiece. Sophomore attack man Ryan Slane also dished out an assist; and in his third appearance of the year between the pipes, sophomore goalkeeper Adam Winne denied eight shots from making the scoreboard.
Head Coach John Jez and the Pioneers return to action next Saturday, April 19, when they face NYIT at noon.

On Tuesday, April 8, the Pioneer softball team (currently 27-5) took the field against the Bears of NYIT in the “Battle of the Boulevard.” The Green and Gold never trailed the Bears once during the day, cruising to two victories at a clip of 7-2, and a 10-0 shutout in the second game.

In game one of the doubleheader, freshman first baseman Kayla McCoy and senior outfielder Alexis Gonzalez were on board for a three run blast by senior shortstop Nicole Hagenah. The three run homer came in the first inning, and the Pioneers looked to add more in the upcoming innings. In the second inning, McCoy extended the lead to 4-0 with a RBI double. After a short two run inning by the visitors, the Pioneers were back at it again as sophomore designated hitter Paige Swantek cleared the bases on a double, giving her squad a 7-2 lead. Senior pitcher Liz Weber earned her 12th win of the season going five innings only giving up one earned run.
In game two, the Pioneers struck early again, scoring five runs in the first inning. McCoy got the Pioneers on the scoreboard with a solo home run, her second home run of the season. A pair of doubles and a single led to four more runs coming across for the Pioneers as they jumped out to a quick 5-0 lead. Freshman pitcher Ashley Martin logged five innings of one hit ball, and gave up no runs while striking out two. McCoy led the charge against the Bears as she went 5-7 for the day, including a double and a home run. The pitching as a whole was also stellar, allowing only two runs on six hits.
The Pioneers took the diamond against the Molloy College Lions on Thursday, April 10, in Brookville, N.Y. The Pioneers split the doubleheader, losing the first game 12-4, ending their impressive 20 game win-streak.
The second game was tightly contested as both teams jumped on each other early, scoring two runs in the first inning. The Lions got one of their runs on a throwing error and tacked on another run via an RBI single by junior second baseman Brenda Lee. The Pioneers answered the visitors’ early push with a two run shot by Gonzalez.
Lions’ senior shortstop, Nicolette Sinagra, nailed a two run shot over the centerfield wall to give her team a 4-2 advantage. Sinagra’s homer was answered by a three run shot by junior catcher Aly Dzierzynski. With the game tied at five in the bottom of the sixth inning, the Pioneers grabbed the lead when junior outfielder Catherine Havens connected on the go ahead and, ultimate, game winning single, plating the sixth run of the game. The Pioneers got the 6-5 win despite having three errors. Their pitching held up as Weber got her 13th win of the season and sophomore pitcher Quincy Lewis shut the door for the save, her fifth of the season.
On Sat. Apr. 12, the Pioneers returned to action to play the Mavericks of Mercy College from Dobbs Ferry N.Y., and the Pioneers gave up a grand total of one run as they swept the two game series.
The Pioneers sent out freshman pitcher Ashley Martin, getting all the run support she needed when sophomore third baseman Maria Palmeri drilled one over the fence for her third homer of the season. The Pioneers added two runs in the sixth inning via a Dzierzynski two run homerun, and they added four runs in the seventh frame to put the game out of reach. Martin went the distance, pitching seven innings and striking out 10, resulting in her 10th victory of the season in the 7-0 final.
The second game was more of the same for the Pioneers, as they cruised to a 5-1 win. The Green and Gold struck first again, scoring a run in the second inning on an error by the Mavericks. The Mavericks tied the game on an RBI groundout in the third inning. In the top of the sixth, LIU scored four runs, three of which came from a Dzierzynski home run. The Pioneers ended up winning 5-1, and took both games conveniently.
The Pioneers continued their busy weekend with a double dip on Sunday, April 13, against the Cougars of Caldwell College. They traded wins with the Cougars, losing the first and bouncing back in the second game.
The Cougars jumped out to an early three run lead in the first inning, and made it 4-0 in the second inning. Sophomore first baseman Brielle Reighn had an RBI and two runs in the first two innings. The Pioneers answered with two runs in the fourth, but the Cougars shut the door on any hopes of a comeback as they won 5-3.
The second game was more of the same for Caldwell, who struck early with three runs. Looking to respond, Dzierzynski hit a three run homer and gave the Pioneers a 4-3 lead. Infielder Maria Palmeri added an insurance run late in the game with a solo homerun, and the Pioneers cruised to an 8-4 win as Martin got her 12th victory of the season.
The Pioneers next sets of games are scheduled for Thursday, April 17, against the Purple Knights from the University of Bridgeport. First pitch is set for 3 p.m. in Brookville, N.Y.
