The winter season of 2013-14 covered LIU Post in plenty of snow, often making it difficult for students to commute to campus. With the warmer weather arriving, students still find it difficult to commute; even though the snow that blanketed Post has melted, the campus is littered with potholes that have been left behind.
Potholes, which are natural cavities in the ground due to the erosion of rock from water, ice, and salt, have been a major problem not only around campus, but also throughout the New York area, because of the winter weather conditions.
“The potholes [on campus] are an inconvenience,” said Megan Calvente, a senior Art Therapy major, “especially the one on the road beside the football field. In combination with the speed bumps, it’s difficult to commute to the art buildings,” Calvente added.
“It’s a pain,” said Georgios Metskas, a senior Geography major, when he spoke about the pothole right outside the Northern Boulevard entrance to Post. “Every time I exit from campus, I feel as if my car bumper is going to scrape up against the road and end up getting scratched. I feel like someone will bottom-out there eventually,” he added.
“There were a lot of potholes, especially on the main roads,” said Bill Kirker, director of Facility Services at Post. Kirker explained that while “hundreds” of potholes have been fixed this season, they continue to reopen due to the rain and snow. As cars drive on the roads coered in ice and salt, it also creates more potholes. Kirker said that Facility Services has plans to repave the roads around campus before commencement in order to even out the roads from both the potholes, as well as those who have temporarily been fixed. “The time it takes depends on when we can get a contractor to repave the roads,” Kirker said.
When asked if any students have reported flat tires due to the potholes, Kirker stated, “No flat tires were called in.” As for any potholes remaining unfixed that students should be aware of, Kirker explained the ones prompting an issue were “already fixed.”
As for the pothole right outside the entrance of Post, Kirker explained that it couldn’t be repaired by the Facility Services Department. “The pothole is considered on Northern Boulevard, meaning that the state has to repair it, since it’s their property.” He reassured students that while the university cannot repair the pothole itself, they have been trying to bring the state’s attention to the issue for some time now.
“Potholes aren’t just an issue on campus, they’re everywhere” Kirker added, reflecting on all the potholes he has seen across different roads on Long Island. “It’s terrible!”

A representative from the North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System, the third largest non-profit, secular healthcare system in the country, and the largest on Long Island, spoke with students on campus on Thursday, April 3, about jobs in the health care field. 
Gregory Saukulak, the Manager of Strategic Sourcing at LIJ, spoke to a large audience of mostly Health Care majors in the Kahn building during common hour. “We are the number one employer on Long Island,” said Saukulak. “The health care field includes health centers, labs, physician offices, ambulatory services, tertiary hospitals, nursing and rehab centers, homecare and hospices, and assisted living,” he added.

 
“What we’re doing as a health system is pulling all together under one umbrella so that we can service the patients and their families. This aspect is very important to the future of health care because of the changes that are happening right now, including an aging population, an obese society, shortages of doctors, and emerging consumerism, among others,” Saukulak said. “One of the things we’re going to wind up seeing is that patients out there have a lot more choices in health-care services, so customer service is going to be one of our main focuses,” he added. “The size, the diversity of services, and the rate of growth are what make our facility unique.” 
“We have affiliations all around, besides the hospital, within our network,” Saukulak added. “All of which allow us to provide not only continuous care for our patients, but also a multitude of services that individuals may need throughout their lives, and the care that they need for their health.” 
Saukulak informed Post students about the unique attributes of LIJ. “We see about four million patients a year, and we have the largest fleet of ambulances in the Northeast right now,” he said. “Our system includes 17 hospitals and a variety of medical centers, and continues to expand. It employs approximately 47,000 people in a variety of areas, not just the medical professions,” he added. NSLIJ is the largest private employer in NY State. 
Job opportunities in the health care industry seem to be the most stable form of employment compared to some other jobs out there, and the New York State Department of Labor expects growth in this area over the next decade. 
Working for a hospital system is not just for Health Care majors; students in business or information technology fields can also partake in this type of work. 
The nursing field, in particular, give a lot of opportunities. There will be a nursing shortage in the near future because 75 percent of nurses are over 40, according to Saukulak. Specific “growth areas of demand are nurse practitioners and physician assistants; they can do anything a doctor can do from an ambulatory setting. There is also a need for home health care aids, physical therapists, occupational therapists, lab techs, as well as professionals in medical coding and billing. The more specialized you are, the more valuable your skill set is, especially if you are a medical practitioner or a physician assistant,” Saukulak said.
“During the hospital’s recruiting process, we identify candidates through opportunities posted through our website (lijcareers. com),” Saukulak said. He encouraged students to set up a profile and sign up for job offers through the website, so that one can receive emails about jobs that matches with what one is looking for. 
“Once we identify a potential candidate, a recruiter views their resume and conducts a phone or a Skype interview to determine if they’re a potential fit for the role,” he said. “It takes 45 minutes to an hour for an interview. If it makes sense to move forward, we send you to the hiring manager. If the hiring manager wants to see you, we schedule a face-to-face interview with him. After an offer is given, the candidate goes through a background check and fingerprinting,” Saukulak explained. 
The hospital system offers internships as well as paid positions. “Applying for internships can be different depending on the program that the student is in,” Saukulak said. “In most cases, internship opportunities and all guidelines can be found online. In other cases, the student should check with his or her department, especially
if an internship is built into the academic program. There is also opportunities for students to volunteer at the hospital. Those positions can be found online, as well.” 
“I already work at LIJ hospital in a psychiatric research clinic, and I do data entry and assist with certain things such as preparing biological samples. It is a volunteer job and my title is a ‘visiting scholar,’” said Stephanie Rubenfeld, a junior Psychology major. “I love working at LIJ. It is a pleasant and friendly environment, and I have gotten great experience,” she added. 
“I heard about the LIJ recruitment event and went because I am interested in pursuing a career in the health care field. The more information I know now, the better chance I will have in the future of getting an internship or job,” said Greg Salanitro, a freshman Health Care Administration major, and added, ”Everyone should take advantage of any speakers that come to Post because they can learn a lot of valuable information and even talk to the speaker after the lecture.”

On Friday, April 11, the Forensic Science and Chemistry departments, and Forensics World, hosted an LIU Post CSI Challenge. Forensics World, an organization that creates interactive educational programs for students, collaborated with LIU Post to host this year’s 14th annual CSI event. The event, held in the Pratt Recreation Center from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., brought together 26 high schools that competed against each other to win first, second, and third place prizes. LIU Post students were given the opportunity to get involved as volunteers.
The CSI Challenge is an event held for aspiring forensic scientists and students interested in the field of law enforcement, to learn about the ins and outs of solving a crime scene investigation. Students who participated in the event were given a scenario that involved a murder case and were asked to solve the case in teams. Step-by-step, they solved the case by collecting forensic evidence, interviewing witnesses, and even presenting their evidence to a mock court.
“Culinary shows are very popular today, so what we did was to create a scenario that had to do with a chef’s competition, where one of the chefs gets killed,” said Dave Tricamo, the Executive Director for Forensics World USA. “It’s exciting this year because we’ve partnered with LIU Post to host our 14th annual event here in the Pratt Center,” Tricamo added.
LIU Post was one of many sponsors to help make this event possible, providing Forensics World with the event space. Around 500 students from 26 high schools all over Long Island, including East Meadow High School, Islip High School, and Long Beach High School, were given the opportunity to learn, as well as use a series of forensic techniques in order to solve the mock crime. Law enforcement workers also attended the event to help evaluate and critique the scenario as it went on.
Police officers, detectives, and forensic scientists all helped deciding which would be the winner, and provided them with a series of trophies and prizes.
Students who wish to learn more about law enforcement or forensic science have the opportunity to gain their education in such fields at Post. LIU Posts College of Liberal Arts and Sciences offer a Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science, as well as a Bachelor of Science, Masters of Science, and Masters of Arts Degree in Criminal Justice.

LIU Post’s campus radio station, WCWP, will host a party on the rooftop (top of the outside deck) of Hillwood Commons during common hour on Wednesday, April 23.
There will be live-band performances by Post students Trish Torrales, Rafe Tangorra, and Joe Voce, who will be doing covers of rock songs, and a live DJ will also be present. Free food vendors will be available, including heroes, and giveaways will be distributed throughout the event. This type of event has never been hosted by the station before. “We are celebrating the semester. We’ve accomplished a lot in terms of new programming, a new website, and a lot of new members, so we want to throw a big party,” said Christina Kay, an alumni of LIU Post and Assistant Station Manager and Program Director of WCWP. “It’s also a little bit of a send off for our seniors, many of whom have been with us for their entire journey here at LIU Post,” Kay added.
The party is for all Post students, not just those involved at WCWP. “It’s a celebration for everyone completing the semester. We want to be a part of not only everyone’s semester, but also their journey here at Post. It’s more of an ‘until next time’ kind of thing, and also a reminder that no matter where students or faculty go during the summer, we are here 24/7 to entertain,” Kay said.
“This event is a great way to end the semester and definitely a nice addition to spring fling,” said Zach Parker, a junior Broadcasting major and FM Radio Engineer at WCWP. “We are hoping for a great turn out and for everyone to have a really good time,” he added. 
“We are hosting this event to promote our radio station and put on a fun event for the students of LIU Post. Everyone is invited to this event and should come. It will be a great way to end the semester, and there will be music, food, and giveaways,” said Will Bruner, a sophomore Broadcasting major, host of WCWP’s “Ain’t That Country,” and sales representative at WCWP. 
“Can’t wait to play with Trish Torrales, a fantastic singer and guitarist. She is such a rock star. Our goal is to keep the crowd entertained. This is an event not to be missed,” said Rafe Tangora, a junior Broadcasting major, member of WCWP, and drummer of the band. Trish Torrales, a junior Broadcasting major, singer and guitarist, and host of “Ain’t That Country” on WCWP, added, “The party should be a huge hit. I am so excited to perform and engage with the student body.”

Social media has become an outlet heavily used by both high school and college students everywhere. We use it to share memories with our friends, create posts, and upload photos, – but do we really think about the consequences of our actions on our social media accounts? Sure, social media is great for networking with peers, sharing status updates about our daily lives and exciting nights, but what happens when the content we post jeopardizes our opportunities of landing a job? 
Students are not the only ones who use social media, although we sometimes forget this. Large and small companies, as well as other institutions, use social networking not only to keep in contact with their current employees, but to learn about potential employees, as well. Students in college who use social media for their own personal use, as well as entertainment, may be under scrutiny by future employers and college campuses.
Today, students use social media for their personal agendas. Social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram make it easy for students to share photos and status updates, as well as connect with other social media outlets. The connectivity of all these sites makes it easier for students’ information to be readily available for anyone to see.
When applying for a job, employers look for someone who will represent their company in the best way possible. The employee whom they choose must fit a certain standard they would like to uphold. The simple misuse of a social media outlet, such as the use of vulgar language or posting images of a night out getting drunk, may cost a hopeful applicant the opportunity to get the job. Of course, there are other factors that play a role in getting a job, such as extra- curricular activities, volunteer work, recommendations, and prior work experiences.
“I made a new Facebook account when I came here to America, but I only have 10 friends,” said Zoey Zhu, a Business Administration graduate student. “If I apply for a job here in America, I would like to keep my account very clean. I know that jobs look at your accounts for poor behavior.”
Questionable imagery or behavior on a social media account may be something that an applicant must explain to whomever it is they are hoping will choose them for a career or scholarly opportunity. 
“I do not upload lots of pictures of myself on Facebook, and I choose not to have certain social media accounts,” said Tatsuto Shibata, a sophomore Business major. “When I begin to apply to jobs, I would not like to have to answer about a bad or drunken photo taken of me years ago.”
For prospective college students, and college students expecting to graduate, it is important that they evaluate the content they upload to their social media accounts. To post photos of friends and events are great, but the images that are posted play a very important role in what employers think about potential employees and their chances of being hired.

Having a college degree is a vital asset to possess before entering the workforce, but due to the high cost of such a degree, many students are forced to take student loans, adding stress to their lives years after college.
For junior Education major Kristin Esbin, her main concern is the time it will take to pay off her student loans. Esbin sees the practice of taking out student loans as something that a lot of people have to go through, and deal with, step-by-step. “I have other things to worry about, too, besides my student loans,” she said.
There is often a minimum payment requirement that has to be met every due date – sometimes every month. Kimberly Toledo, a freshman Photography major, said that her primary concern was the limit on payment plans. “I’m concerned if I’m going to meet that limit,” she said.
As a freshman, there are limits to what you can earn at a job. “I do have a job now, but it’s no way near paying [back] thousands of dollars for this school,” Toledo said. In Toledo’s case, it is her mom who pays for her student loans at the moment. Another concern for her is what happens if her mother can’t pay for the loans.
“I don’t think so,” was Toledo’s answer when asked if taking student loans to go to school was worth it. When asked why she did it anyway, she said, “Cause I have to.” She feels pressure from society to get a degree in order to get a job. “High school, college, job,” she said.
Rachel Zerah, a junior Psychology major, is free of student loans. “I came in with a lot of scholarships,” she said. After her scholarships, Zerah pays about $6,000 a year to attend Post. For graduate school, however, Zerah will have to take up student loans. Her worry is, “How long it’s going to take to pay [it] back,” she said, which is a similar concern shared with many others. As a junior, Zerah has been thinking about grad school, and the thought of taking up loans scares her a bit.
Julie Baumgarten, a senior Broadcasting major, does not get any money from the school, and has had to take student loans. “Sad, broke, and scared,” she said, when asked about her feelings on her loans.
With loan payments of more than $1,800 a month, Baumgarten said, “I don’t know how I’ll be able to pay that back, even if I do get a full-time job.” With the end of her college career fast approaching, she describes thinking of her student loans as “really scary.”
Baumgarten said that she didn’t think it was worth paying so much money to go to Post. When asked what she thought the school could do to help students with the outlook of expensive student loans to repay, she said, “Stop raising tuition.” She added that the school could give out more scholarships and grants.
Ashley Martucci, a junior Elementary Education major, said that she thinks about her student loans a lot. Yet, she is hopeful that she will get a job right after graduation. When thinking about her student loans and the future, Martucci said, “It just stresses me out.”
A lot of students have to lend money, and many of them worry about how they are going to pay them back, and how long it will take. Student loans give students who don’t get other financial support a chance to get an education, but having to pay all of it back is a source of concern. Educational institutions can help by giving out more scholarships, grants, and making tuition affordable.

On April 2, Lu Zhao, a graduate student in the School of Counseling, was elected as the new President of the International Student Union (ISU).
Each of the three candidates gave five-minute speeches to international students, voters, and current affiliates, including KSA, CSSA, TSA, the Indo- American Club, and the Vikings on March 26 about why they wanted to be selected president, and what they aspired to do as such.
Zhao kicked off her speech by saying, “Sorry, I just got back from work,” and won the election. Zhao currently has an internship at Roslyn High School as a school counselor on Mondays and Thursdays from 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. “I really love to communicate with students and people around me; I feel very happy when I can help other people,” she said. She referred to counseling as the art of language. She believes the way you deliver your speech defines who you are.
Zhao ran for the position because she has gone through multiple difficulties as an international student during her past three years at Post. “Orientation for new students was really helpful, but once school started, I soon felt isolated because I had big English problems, didn’t know anything about school, and I was scared to ask for help,” she said.
She explained that it was a sad time, during which she lost her confidence. “It could have been better if I didn’t hesitate to ask people for help.” She added, “I know so many students who feel the same way as I felt before, and I understand those feelings. I want those people to know that there are so many people who are experienced, knowledgeable, and willing to help them. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to be President of ISU.” Zhao said that she also wanted to devote her time to school, and to develop her resume.
For her future plans as ISU president, Zhao wants to hold an event that both domestic and international students can get excited about. She said, “Homecoming is catching my eye. There are many international students who go to watch students play, dance, and sing, but I want each person to get involved.”
Zhao worked with CHATS for two semesters in 2013, and realized there was always the same group of people who attended international events, and that international students shy away from joining events that domestic students organize. Zhao hopes to change that situation. She is ready to apply her own experiences that she had learned, both socially and academically.
On April 10 and April 17 after work, Zhao will join the ISU meetings for her training. “Last week (April 10), I was at the meeting to observe, and then got trained by two advisors: Professor Laslie Bai and Graduate assistant Trista Yang Lu,” Zhao said. They discussed responsibilities and expectations with Zhao, e-board members, and international students.
Current ISU President Stephanie Trieu, a sophomore Art Therapy major, will join in Zhao’s training. Trieu will complete her term as president at the end of the spring semester. “For me, ISU is not just a club. It is a union between students not from any one country, but numerous countries and regions. We share different lives, and ISU allowed me to glimpse into the world of others,” Trieu said.
Trieu is enthusiastic about her successor and the rest of the ISU team. “For the new ISU, I have great faith that the new e-board will surpass my expectations. I am sure they will expand ISUs doors to many more students from other countries, and I look forward to their work,” Trieu said.
As a club, ISU hopes to be a center of opportunities for students to meet people from all over the world, and to learn from one another.

LIU Post is a community with culture and customs from all over the world, which is a source of both learning and culture shock for many of the international students on campus.
Shekofeh Gholamreza is a sophomore Business Administration major, with a Management minor. She is an international student from Gothenburg, Sweden. Gholamreza found that the U.S. would be a great place for her to study when she was visiting New York. She fell in love with the city, and decided to make the move in the fall 2013. “I felt like the U.S. is a great place to study business,” she said.

There were a lot of new things she hadn’t experienced as a tourist, but things she would have to face in everyday life as someone who lives in the U.S. “People were different, mostly; I guess my biggest shock was when random people just came up and started to talk to me and were kind. Americans are more open, and strangers may initiate a conversation with you or compliment you,” Gholamreza said. “I guess in Sweden we mind our own business; we read our own paper and listen to music on the train, not minding other people,” she said.
Another big shock for Gholamreza was the American food habits. “There is a lot more processed food and fried food,” she said. This is not the case in Sweden, but she likes the availability of places to eat. Restaurants and cafes are more spread out here than in Sweden, and she likes that everything is available “around the corner.”
The uncertainty and excitement of leaving your home and travelling to a new country to study can be uncomfortable, according to Gholamreza. She found a big help in the International Student Services (ISS) on campus. ISS hosted international student orientation right before school resumed in fall 2013. At the ISS orientation, the international students got to know the campus and each other before the American students arrived. She found great comfort in knowing that there were other people in the same situation as she was. “We were able to help each other through the first tough weeks,” she said.
Another shock for Gholamreza was, “College life in general,” a challenge shared by both American and foreign students. Gholamreza’s best experience so far has been getting to know all the different people with all the different backgrounds, something easy to find on a campus with so many international students. She said that she has made several American friends by attending school clubs, such as Delta X, and playing intramural soccer. “By getting to know one or two Americans, you become friends with their friends, and your friendship circle starts to grow,” she said.
One important step in adapting to the American way of life has been Gholamreza’s American friends. “I have learned [so] much about their culture and language, and they have made my adaption to the culture a lot easier, and it has been a lovely experience,” she said.

For some, a bucket list is a rite of passage that is individualistic in nature. A bucket list takes a person’s innermost desires and goals, and compiles them into a list to be completed before they die. One might believe that this is a morbid reminder of death, but for some, a bucket list is an exuberant reminder to live, not to just exist in a world of complacency.

“To be honest, I never saw a bucket list as being a list of things to complete before you die,” said Danielle Sposato, a sophomore English Literature major. “I see it [as] more of a plan for life. My whole life is a bucket list.” 
Sposato’s bucket list used to have an entirely different meaning before she met her boyfriend, which by itself was a completion
of the most important part of her list. “One of [my] major [goals] was love. It is kind of weird to think that love is an
accomplishment. It used to be a dream for me. I am only 20-years-old, but I have always fantasized about soul mates and all of that,” Sposato said.
Now, instead of viewing a bucket list as a list of things that she wants to do, Sposato looks at it as an opportunity to make memories with her boyfriend. “Because of him, my bucket list has been altered. That’s what is so interesting about bucket lists; they aren’t permanent,” she said.
However, for some students like Candice Licalzi, a senior Fine Arts major, a bucket list is a reminder to find out more about the world and to become as educated as she can with the time that she has on Earth.
“My bucket list is to understand why certain things happen,” Licalzi said.
“To find out why people behave the way that they do. I want to be able to travel to places like Hiroshima and Egypt to better understand the world. You only live once, so why not be able to see the whole world?”
For Licalzi, traveling is the central focus for her bucket list. The experiences will allow her to broaden her horizons by exploring all that the world has to offer. “At the end of my days, I could say that I learned something; I saw the world, and I don’t have any more questions,” Licalzi said.
Many students at LIU Post put traveling at the top of their lists, or mentioned getting married or falling in love. Natalie Sorge, a junior Public Relations major, couples both of these areas in her list that contains 177 things to do before she dies. Sorge has already completed some of her items, including riding the London Eye, a giant ferris wheel on the south bank of the River Thames in London, and traveling to Barcelona, Spain.
“I really want to swim in all of the Great Lakes, visit all of the Disney parks all over the world, go to Vegas for my 21st birthday in July, and visit Ireland,” Sorge said.
Much like Sposato, Sorge’s bucket list also focuses on love. As Sorge pointed to the promise ring on her finger, she revealed that one of the most important things on her bucket list is to get married to her boyfriend and to have their honeymoon in Santorini, Greece. One thing that human beings are bonded by is the fact that we will not live forever. For some, a bucket list might seem like a silly activity. However, for many, it is a reminder that the time we have on this earth is limited, and we should make the most of it.

It is a late night TV change of guard. The announcement that David Letterman will retire from the “Late Show” in 2015 – presumably sometime around when his contract is up in August of the same year – truly signifies the end of an era in late night TV. When rival host Jay Leno retired from “The Tonight Show” in February, the biggest question was when Letterman would follow suit. The answer is out there now.
“I phoned [Leslie Moonves] just before the program,” Letterman explained on the April 3 broadcast of the “Late Show.” “And I said, ‘Leslie it’s been great. You’ve been great, the network has been great, but I’m retiring.’”
The 66-year-old late night veteran will go down in history as the second greatest late night talk show host, only behind Jonny Carson. Letterman, in fact, was the handpicked successor for Carson before NBC gave “The Tonight Show” to Leno in 1992. It later came out that Carson would even send Letterman the occasional joke to use in his monologue.
It wasn’t just his connection to talk show royalty, but his wit and humor that set him apart in the world of late night TV. In 1996, he was on TV Guide’s ‘50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time’ list.
“It’s saddening [be]cause he’s a funny guy and you don’t want to see him go,” said Joe Voce, a senior Electronic Media major. “But he’s been there for 30-40 years. All good things must come to an end.”
Like other greats, Letterman had his critics; especially when it came to his, at times, unenthusiastic demeanor. Some would even say he was mean at times.
“I’m not trying to sound mean, but I always felt that Letterman was a little bit of a mean guy,” said Jake Scotto, a junior Broadcasting major. “He never seemed to be too into what he was doing.”
But maybe that was the charm of it. Even his retirement announcement was something that was casually announced as if he was describing what he had for lunch that day.
His replacement, Stephen Colbert, – who CBS announced would take over the show – won’t be anything like Letterman, and that’s not a bad thing. Late night TV appears to be transitioning to a younger demographic. NBC’s schedule has a pair of hosts who have brought some of their shtick from Saturday Night Live to late night. It will be interesting to see what Colbert will bring to the “Late Show,” considering the personality he perpetuates on his Comedy Central show “The Colbert Report.” 
“It’s definitely getting younger,” Voce said about the new core of late night hosts. “A lot of the old guys are gone now.” Scotto added, “Letterman and Leno were more serious guys in certain situations. I feel like Fallon, Conan [O’Brian], Colbert, and [Jimmy] Kimmel [are] more laid back. They’re goofier and it seems they’ll do more fun things… Especially Colbert and Fallon.”
