Major League Baseball has approved Hedge fund mogul Steve Cohen as the new owner of the New York Mets. Cohen now owns 95 percent of the team, purchased from the Mets’ previous owners, the Wilpon and Katz families. 
Cohen, who previously held a minority share of the team, released a statement thanking the league and other executives for allowing him to take this step forward into the Mets’ front office.“I am humbled that MLB’s owners have approved me to be the next owner of the New York Mets. Owning a team is a great privilege and an awesome responsibility,” he said. “I would like to thank the owners and Commissioner Manfred and his team for welcoming me to Major League Baseball.” 
Recent Post alumni, Ryan Kraut, has been a lifelong super fan of the Mets. He says he’s been waiting for a change like this for a very long time. 
“ It’s going to be so nice to have an owner that not only will properly run the team but will spend money to improve it,”Kraut said. “It is finally a new era in Mets history, and I couldn’t be more excited. I never thought this day would come.” Kraut is excited to see what kind of talent Cohen will bring to the organization. “Steve Cohen has more money than the next three richest owners COMBINED, and I can’t wait for the spending spree to start,” he said. 
Previously, the Wilpon and Kratz families were dubbed “The coupons” by fans after continually underspending for a major market franchise. Both families struggled financially after being linked to the Bernie Madoff scandal in 2008. 
Sophomore broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher agrees with Kraut that this switch in ownership will be great for the team. 
“To see a switch in ownership from a group of owners who seemed to take the easy way out of things, to see an already interactive understanding owner in Cohen is great. It seems he’s truly invested into the Mets for the love of the game and not for personal gain,” Boettcher said. “I also love to see how interactive he is with the fans and his players with his funny one-liners and important team press conferences. Overall, Cohen seems like a breath of fresh air and a step in the right direction for the Mets.” 
Cohen has purchased the team for $2.4 billion. He has also said he will donate $17.5 million to New York small businesses and increase the Mets Foundation’s donations in the coming years. Cohen also has plans to reinstate pre-pandemic salaries for New York Mets employees.

Football, an American classic, has been played on Thanksgiving day since 1920. NFL and college football have historically hosted games on Thanksgiving day and usually have various teams that play throughout the day. 
This Thanksgiving, the NFL teams that had played were Houston Texas at Detroit Lions and Washington Football Team at Dallas Cowboys. This year, College Football was thrown to a halt due to Covid-19 and Universities precautions to make sure everyone is safe and healthy. 
 The Texans Vs. The Lions game was 41 to 25, with the Texans holding the win, and the Washington Vs. Cowboys game with a 41-16, Washington getting that win as well. As many sat down to enjoy their Thanksgiving meals, they had the chance to relax and watch the games, and give their opinion on how they thought the games went and their opinions on the winning teams. 
Brandon Cossaro, a junior, was not as excited for the games this year compared to previous seasons. “Although I watch the football games on Thanksgiving every year, this year I did not sit down and get into them,” Cossaro said. “With everything going on in the world, I decided to spend a little more time with my family and focus on being together than separating and going in the other room with the guys and watching the game.” 
Cossaro is hopeful next year will allow for a much better circumstance. “Covid-19 has impacted the sports world tremendously and has led to many changes and honestly made this Thanksgivings’ games unenjoyable,” he said. “I did read the outcome of the games and was not too surprised with the teams who took the win, but I am hopeful that possibly next Thanksgiving I will be able to sit down and watch an intense football game with my family.” 
Will Snelders, a junior, was also more focused on family this Thanksgiving.“I didn’t watch the games this year for the first time because my nephew had come over, and I was focusing on spending time with him and playing fun games like football and having a catch of our own,” Snelders said. “I was home with my dad as well, and he hates the NFL currently because he doesn’t like what the players are doing with all of the BLM and stop police brutality stuff because it hits home with him.” 
Although many are hurting and missing sports tremendously this year, people had taken a break from what was happening outside of their homes and within the sports world to sit and try to enjoy their first Thanksgiving during a national pandemic with their loved ones.

The MLB offseason can be a stressful and exciting time for those passionate about the team’s outcome that they are rooting for. The bartering, trading, and signing that goes on during the offseason can elicit many feelings for those who are paying attention, as fans of all 30 Major League clubs have an emotional stake in what tactics their teams take to set themselves up for the upcoming season. 
Since we are  in New York, many of LIU’s students have a vested interest in the New York Mets or Yankees. Jason Glickman,  a senior Broadcasting major and Mets fan, is skeptical of their ability to go the distance. “I hope they win the world series, but I know they’ll disappoint me.” 
The disappointment expressed by Mets fans seems to be a common sentiment. Eddie McQuade, a senior sports management major, said that he is a “Mets fan (sadly)”. McQuadefeels that with Steve Cohen in charge, there is much more potential 
“Now that Steve Cohen is the new owner, I think there’s going to  be a lot of changes, and some have already occurred. Cohen already cleaned out the front office, which I’m happy with because I thought Brodie trading for Diaz and Cano set the team back five years,” he said. “I remember saying when the rumors were floating around regarding that trade, it would be a mistake.”
 It is clear that Met’s fans are not enthralled with the decisions made by the team, However, it does seem that the Met’s have made somewhat of a dent in their reputation and made some positive changes for this upcoming season.
As for the New York Yankees, it seems similar feelings are in the air amongst fans. Anthony Cavaretta, a senior broadcasting major does not think the Yankees will do much this offseason.“Probably nothing and just resign everyone and try again next year,” he said. Though Cavaretta was disappointed with the team’s decisions, he did share some hopes for the Yankees’ improvement. “I would like the team to build a better pitching rotation, as that is the last piece we need to win a championship,” he said.
The two New York professional baseball teams disappointed their fans so far during this offseason. However, all three fans seem to remain optimistic about their team’s future, so long as they make the right decisions. The season starts up again in April. Around this time next year, we will know if these predictions were accurate.

This NFL season has been different than any other before, with COVID and many injuries around the league. One thing that has stayed consistent most of the season is the NFL power rankings. 
For almost all this season, the Kansas City Chiefs have been ranked at the top, with the Pittsburgh Steelers coming in at two for a couple of weeks. The rest of the rankings have switched it up from time to time, as the Seattle Seahawks were once top 5 but fell to 13 in this week’s rankings after a bad loss to the Rams. Coming up on the half-way point of the NFL season teams are beginning to show who’s real and who’s not. 
The New Orleans Saints come in at number three but just placed starting quarterback Drew Brees on injured reserve with broken ribs and a collapsed lung which makes their future uncertain. The Baltimore Ravens fall to number six after losing to the Patriots fighting for a playoff spot with a 6-3 record. At number 11 is the Miami Dolphins, who have hit a stride since inserting Tua Tagovailoa at quarterback, and Brian Flores is squarely in the Coach of the Year conversation. The Tennessee Titans at 14, the Cleveland Browns at 15, and the Minnesota Vikings at 16 are all teams with big aspirations and big running games but haven’t lived up to it yet. Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers land at number 19, which might be high for this team.
The Chargers have a rookie of the year candidate in Herbert but are 3-16 in one-score games since last season. One of the biggest drop-offs this season has to be the San Francisco 49ers at 21. The Niners have had too many injuries to come back from as they crawl to the finish line. At the bottom of the rankings is no surprise, with the New York Jets at 32, Jacksonville Jaguars at 31, and underwhelming Dallas Cowboys at 30 fighting for the number one draft pick. 
Though these power rankings change every week so how much will they change during the second half of the season? Eddie McQuade, a senior sports management major, thinks the power rankings could be quite different as the season goes along. “I’ve noticed the Vikings are starting to make a nice run, so I think it’s only a matter of time before they jump the Bears. I also think the Dolphins rebuild is surprisingly strong right now, but I’m not sure if they’re ready for that next step yet,” he said. “I also believe that New Orleans losing Brees and starting hill is going to cost them the second seed, while the Seahawks defense will be their downfall in the first round of the playoffs.”
McQuade thinks the NFC East has been even worse than he would’ve thought. “I think the winner of the NFC East is gonna be 6-10, and whoever wins the NFC East shouldn’t be allowed to host a playoff game and most likely will get embarrassed by four touchdowns,” he said.
Elise Person, a senior journalism major thinks, the only undefeated team left in the NFL is just getting started. “I think the Steelers are going to make a real strong push during the playoffs. They’re making a strong run right now and I don’t see their momentum slowing anytime soon,” she said. Elise also is disappointed in the NFC East with one team in particular. “The Eagles were a total let down this year. I had really high hopes for them especially once we had some break out players from the practice squad,” she said. The Eagles are spiraling right now and it’s a total disappointment of a season.” Regarding the playoffs, Elise is not confident the Eagles will go far. 
“If the Eagles do make the playoffs, there is no way they win their first game. They can barely hold their own in the NFC East. There is no way they can compete outside of their division,” she said. If one thing is for sure, it’s that the second half of the NFL season still has a lot left to offer.

The Long Island University Basketball teams are working hard despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic. Ty Flowers and Brandy Thomas received All-NEC awards going into the playing season. While this isn’t the first time being awarded, both players are still grateful and excited about the upcoming season.
Flowers, a Redshirt Senior, is a key component to the Men’s team. He started all 32 games last season and set career highs in scoring, blocks, rebounds and assists. “I’ve gotten an award every year I’ve been here but this one means a little more because it’s a First Team, and in the past years, it’s been Second or Third Team,” Flowers said.   
Brandy Thomas, a Junior on the Women’s team, has earned other NEC awards in her years at LIU, but All-NEC means even more to her. “I’m grateful for being named preseason All-NEC, but it just makes me feel very humble. I really want to get a ring for my team this year, so I’m happy to receive the award, but it’s not about me,” Thomas said. She started 25 games and was ranked second in the NEC in rebounding last season. 
The Northeast Conference announced the 2020-21 basketball schedules with COVID-19 modifications. They will keep an 18-game regular season, and travel games will be played on back-to-back days against the same opponent at the same site. Along with that, the NEC will mirror the Men’s and Women’s schedules.
Undoubtedly, both players are excited and eager to get the season underway. Flowers’ goals for the season are to be named Player of the Year and win the championship. “We just want to take our competition to the next level. You can’t do that without playing games, so we’re just trying to get out there and play. We’re excited and Hungry,” Flowers said.  
Thomas is looking forward to getting back on the court with her team and has goals to get a championship ring this year. “It’s just excitement. Being happy with wins, when we win, and even the downfalls when we lose, just being with the team, and getting that feeling and adrenaline back from playing,” Thomas said. 
Conference play will begin on Dec. 8, with each team playing three or four times in December. After the holiday break, the NEC schedule will resume on Jan. 7.

Long Island University has added Women’s Gymnastics to the athletic program in 2020. Head coach Randy Lane recently hired two assistant coaches, Hallie Mossett and Lauren Martinez. Mossett and Martinez are both decorated athletes, with high levels of experience. 
Mossett spent her first four years at UCLA as an athlete with her final year being an undergraduate assistant coach on the 2018 National Championship team. She was named Pac-12 specialist and freshman as well as First Team All American. Lane also coached Mossett in college.
Mosset is determined and goal-oriented going into this position. She also hopes to contribute her skills with technique, dance, choreography and performance.  “One of my goals is to encourage these women to be the best athletes and people they can be in hopes that they will make the most of their collegiate athletics experience and learn a lot of great life lessons,” Mosset said. 
Martinez competed at Michigan, where she earned Big Ten Champion both as an individual and with her team before graduating in 2018. In 2017 Martinez was named a NSCA All-American for her work in strength and conditioning and earned the team’s Most Improved Award. She was also a volunteer assistant coach at Rutgers before coming to LIU.
Martinez is excited to use her experience while coaching to help improve every athlete’s ability. “My goals as a coach are to remind these young women how fun our sport is, and there is more to life than just gymnastics. I hope to help these athletes reach their full potential within this sport as well as help guide them into becoming the young women they are striving to be once their career is finished,” Martinez said. 
The team is fairly young, with 16 freshmen and four transfer sophomores. Lane is excited about the growth and development that can take place as a team. He also focuses on goals and individual success.
“I believe that setting one’s sights on a goal will push each individual to do their best. If I can help an athlete understand that their success should not be compared to anyone else’s goals or success, then I have helped them achieve their individual self-confidence and contributed to their growth,” Lane said. 
The Sharks Gymnastics team will compete in the East Atlantic Gymnast League in their opening season as an athletic program.

As the fall semester comes to an end, spring registration for Post students to select classes began Monday, Nov. 9 for most students. Post opened up registration for students to look at all of the classes being offered this spring and sign up for which ones they want to be in. 
Junior special education major Payton Napoli, who is focusing on history education, had a hard time signing up for the classes she needs to graduate.
“I only had four options for history classes to take, which I had already taken three of and needed a total of 20 credits to graduate with the history focus,” Napoli said. “I also had difficulty finding education classes for the spring semester especially being that the ones offered were very limited and only had times during my other classes.” 
Napoli will be doing both in-person and online classes next semester.
“My professors have chosen to do half remote and half online, which I actually would rather be in person for all of them. I think I learn a lot better being in person with a professor than on Zoom which can have a ton of technical issues and is harder to understand the material.”
Many students were disappointed with the lack of course options for next semester.
“I thought that [Post] did not provide enough class options for students for the spring semester,” sophomore veterinary technology major Sarah Henderson said. “While I understand that it is difficult to offer all classes right now due to COVID-19 staff shortages, I still think that they should offer enough classes to cover all major and minor requirements so that students do not fall behind in their studies. I did not have any issues with registration, except for that some of my vet tech classes were scheduled at the same time for some reason, but this issue was resolved.”
Students will be behind their graduation schedule if the unh does not offer enough classes for each major and minor.
“For vet tech majors, they did not provide any class options for some of the requirements that we are required to take next semester,” Henderson said. “By not offering these requirements, most people in my program are falling behind as we are not able to fulfill our four year plan here. Additionally, my equine minor has not offered any classes that I can take. Over the last two years, they have only offered the same class, meaning I cannot take any other classes I need in order to fulfill my minor by the time I graduate. It is very frustrating, as I do not want to fall behind in my studies, but I may have to drop my minor simply because the school is not offering any of the classes.”
Sophomore musical theatre major BrayLynn Willis had an easy time making her schedule, but still had problems with courses getting filled up too quickly to make her ideal schedule.
“Class selection went better than usual for me,” Willis said. “I got an email from my promise coach the week before registration opened, so I was able to prepare exactly what I wanted to take next semester. Unfortunately, the classes I am in fill up quickly, so I wasn’t able to build my schedule the way I wanted to … I registered at noon on Monday and all but two or three of the classes I wanted to register for were closed. I am now unable to take one of the classes that fills my WAC and CMA requirements this upcoming semester because of scheduling conflicts. I wish there was a way to alleviate that problem, but at this point, I’ll just have to take the class a different semester.”
While some people claimed they had difficulty getting in touch with their Promise coaches, all coaches had available times to meet via Zoom once registration opened.
“My Promise coach is really great about getting in touch with me and helping me set up my schedule for this upcoming fall semester,” senior physical education and health major Cassie Zangerle said. “It’s definitely harder on both ends to navigate everything remotely, but in these times we don’t have a choice so I’m just really trying to make it work.” 
As an education major, Zangerle expressed her concerns with social distancing impacting her courses next semester.
“My major concern with the spring semester is with my student teaching,” she said. “I just don’t know what’s going to happen in regards to being remote or in-person. COVID has added many extra stresses that were never an element before.”
With the pandemic still around, some students debated whether or not they would return to campus.
“I am planning on returning in person next semester,” Willis said. “I believe college is about the training, not about the grades. My career will not be based on whether or not I passed my classes, but if I can actually apply what I’ve learned. I just don’t think online learning can provide the same training or quality of education as being in person. Despite what’s going on in the world, I have to come back in order to feel like I am getting what I am meant to be getting from my college experience.” 
While it has been a different experience for students registering for the spring semester during a pandemic, students are excited to see what next semester brings them.

On Oct. 31, New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo updated COVID-19 guidelines that permit out-of-state travelers who come to New York to opt to “test out” of the mandated 14-day quarantine previously established. 
“We’re going to a new plan given the changing facts, and the experts suggest we shift to a testing policy,” Cuomo said. “We bent the curve of this virus by following the data and the science, and we are continuing that approach with these new guidelines.”
Effective Wednesday, Nov. 4, out-of-state travelers may, following a mandatory three-day quarantine, on the fourth day of quarantine seek another COVID-19 test. If both the original test taken over the previous three days of the quarantine period and the fourth day test come back negative, the traveler may exit quarantine.
The Nov. 4 policy changes affect members of the campus community attending from out-of-state.
 Out-of-state sophomore health science major Miranda Ruiz shares her thoughts on the updated policy allowing for a briefer quarantine experience. 
“I like not having to stay in quarantine for a whole two weeks. However, I know that those two weeks are necessary for determining whether or not someone is infected with COVID-19, so it’s a little worrying,” Ruiz said. “I don’t feel as though it’s as effective as the two-week quarantine, because most symptoms don’t begin showing themselves until after a week and also most people with COVID-19 are contagious for around 10 days.”
Out-of-state sophomore musical theatre major Hannah Winston also shared her thoughts on the pre-spring semester quarantine mandate. 
“I believe it will give us as students time not only to settle in, but just to be safe before we are all exposed to each other again when classes start up,” Winston said.
Students attending from outside of New York State share their prospects of returning to campus in the spring 2021 semester. 
“I plan on coming back for the spring [2021] semester,” Ruiz said. “I don’t intend on wasting the money I paid for room and board. I also think attending class in-person is more effective.”
 Some students have personal motivations for returning to campus in the spring 2021 semester. 
“I do plan to come back for the spring [2021] semester because I have siblings and family back home and their school situations could be different or change again from being in-person to online,” Winston said. “I also am coming back just so I can still be able to work and focus on my own individual environment.”
Post requested payment for meal plans during the four-day quarantine required in the spring 2021 semester. 
Some students that are required to take part in the four-day quarantine share their thoughts on the meal plan payment.
 “I understand what they are trying to do with this option because people quarantining need to be able to have access to food, but it will depend on how much it is for me to figure out my options,” Winston said. “As of now, I don’t know if I will be purchasing a meal plan or not.”
Other students are concerned about the quality of the meal plan and how it will be handled during the quarantine. 
“I hope that the delivery of the meals is better than the fall [2020] quarantine. I was constantly forgotten about and my meals would be brought late,” Ruiz said. “I will likely buy the meal plan just because it is more convenient, but only time will tell.”
Out-of-state students are generating alternatives to the meal plan should they choose to opt out.
 “A plan for me could be either a delivery service or finding a friend on campus with a car to go and grab food/meals and/or groceries before the term starts,” Winston said.
This prospective alternative to purchasing the meal plan is shared by other out-of-state students. 
“If I opt out, I will buy groceries and just make my own meals,” Ruiz said.
Updates to what will happen next semester at Post are sent through student emails from President Kimberly Cline and student affairs whenever decisions are made.

Netflix dropped a new show, “Emily in Paris”, on Oct. 2, and it has gained popularity on social media platforms such as Tik Tock, Instagram and Twitter.. Lily Collins stars as American Emily who gets sent to France for work, and how she navigates Parisian culture and the change of lifestyle. Soon, as Emily learns to adjust to Paris, she finds herself becoming a social media influencer through her Instagram @emilyinparis; although not picked up through the initial title this is supposed to be a play on words “Emi-lee in Par-ee. ”
Many students found themselves fascinated with the show and the introduction into French culture. Freshman criminal justice major Anna Hughes said, “ I liked that the show  took place in France. I’m very into other cultures and languages and want to visit other countries as much as possible which is really why “Emily in Paris” drew my attention.” 
The French aspect definitely drew in viewers, just as Emily being an Instagram influencer; Alexa Cohen, freshman education major said, “My favorite part of the show was getting an insight into the french culture and seeing how Emily made a living off of social media.”
Sophomore musical theater major Sara Wally, “I’m really conflicted about the show because I both loved and hated it. I feel like it had a really great cast, I love Lily Collins but the writing was very mediocre. I couldn’t tell if the show was meant to be satire or not but it’s definitely one of those shows that you love and hate too.”
Wally was disappointed in the clothes too, “The fashion was very Rue 21, i’m not even gonna lie. Not all of the outfits were bad but some of them were pretty questionable. For a show about fashion and marketing I was expecting better.”
However, many critics online argue the feasibility of Emily’s life in the show. Some argue about how she lived there for so long and never adapted to a bit of French Culture, or how unrealistic her Instagram fame was in correlation to how many followers she was supposed to have. Other’s saw the stereotypical portrayal of the classic ‘French attitude,’ as cliche.  Freshman biology major Brianna Tribble said, “Many of the French characters definitely were very standoffish and rude to Emily when she first arrived in Paris, really highlighting the trope of French snobbiness.”
Sara Wally said, “The way that french came across was very stereotypical and I don’t think it was in any way realistic. Like I said it was almost a satire and almost campy.”
Tribble felt the best part of the show was the romance, “My favorite part of this show was probably the love triangle that was going on, it definitely made things interesting and kept my attention.” 
Hughes, Tribble, and Cohen all recommended “Emily in Paris” to other students, “ It is only one season and is really easy to get into,” said Cohen. Hughes even got her roommate to watch. 
“Emily in Paris” recently got renewed for a second season that should premiere sometime next year.

Podcasts are another platform for the spread of ideas and information and they are gaining popularity among college students at a rapid pace. A podcast is an episodic series of spoken word digital audio files that a user can download to a personal device for easy listening. You may have been exposed to podcasts by the infamous Joe Rogan, who has over 12 million monthly listeners. There is a podcast for everything: sex, love, psychology, science, comedy, conspiracy theories and more.
A very common podcast amongst college students is the “Call Her Daddy Podcast”. Originally recorded and edited by Alex Cooper and Sofia Franklin, but recently only featuring Cooper and her guests. “Call Her Daddy” is a raunchy and brutally honest podcast covering the realities of sex, love, and dating in modern times.
  Nursing major Brianna Marschall, is a fan of the podcast. “It is just like a normal conversation with your best friends. It’s extremely empowering for women. They share their own stores humorously and in an open way, which gives others the leverage to have confidence in their own lives,” Marschall said. “Some may not think that “Call Her Daddy” isn’t for them and that’s totally fine because there is a podcast out there for everybody, but at the end of the day Alex Cooper helps to empower her massive fan base of college aged girls and up to live more confidently.” 
  Business management major Julia Towne also decided to give the podcast a listen recently. Towne said. “I listened to the “Call Her Daddy” podcast because my friend recommended it, and it was pretty funny.” The “Call Her Daddy” podcast is hit amongst college students. The humor and advice in it seems to be the main attraction point for this podcast. 
Another podcast that students are listening to is “The Sip.” This podcast is hosted by Ryland Adams and Lizze Gordon. “The Sip” features stories about pop culture, hot topics, and mouth burning celebrity gossip. Sports management major Michaela Zabicki is a fan of “The Sip.” “If you like light hearted/regular conversation with the occasional guest and some laughter to take some seriousness away from your stressful days, I think you’d like it,” Zabicki said, “ It’s a good way to just get my mind off of some stressful things during school and just listen to a conversation as if I’m a part of it as well.” 
In these unprecedented times where we may be looking for new forms of entertainment, it is clear that for some folks that podcasts are filling that spot. They offer comedy, advice, news, as well as general entertainment. If you are looking to listen to a new podcast, you can easily access them on Apple Podcasts as well as Spotify.

On Oct.30, Trippie Redd dropped his highly anticipated album, “Pegasus”.  The artist announced his album back in March, and fans have been impatiently waiting ever since.  
“I’ve been waiting to hear this album for months.  I’m a huge fan of Trippie Redd, so I expected this album to be good, ” said junior acting major Daniel Leach. 
Leach loved the album cover art Trippie used and  appreciated the detail and design put into it. 
“I think the album cover is super cool and intricate.  I really like the positioning of Trippie in front of the pegasus, as well as the starry sky in the background, but that might just be because I have an obsession with outer space,” Leach said.
 “Pegasus” is much longer than Trippie Redd’s other albums, with 26 songs. 
“I was shocked and excited to see how long the album was when it came out.  I was not expecting that since most of his albums range from 12-16 songs.” Said Leach.
With a plethora of songs to choose from, “Excitement” gained popularity quite quickly on social media platforms, specifically Tik Tok.
“I think ‘Excitement’ is probably one of the most well-known songs on the album.  It was blowing up on TikTok for a month or so.” Leach said.
However despite the length and anticipation,  “Pegasus” wasn’t a fan favorite for some listeners
“Life’s A Trip was definitely better than Pegasus. I know a lot of other fans agree that this album lacked personality,” Leach said. “ Out of 10 I’d have to rate it about a 7. It was alright, and of course I loved it because I’m a fan of Trippie Redd, but it was definitely lackluster. I don’t think it’s anything to go crazy over, but it’s nice background music especially if you like his style.”
Pegasus is available on multiple music platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and other popular streaming services.  If you enjoy Trippie Redd, fans’ opinions say it’s worth a listen.

Ariana Grande released her sixth studio album on Oct. 30.  The album told the story of Grande’s maturity through herself and experiences gained over the years of her musical career.  The album spoke to a different side of Grande, one that was introduced as a new sound.  “Positions” is the reconciliation of the self, in this case, of Grande. Grande spoke on themes of growth through pain and loss, and the heights of joy derived from pleasure and love.  The elements of the album are still familiar to Grande, her high tones, softs mhm’s, and eccentric beats gave vision to her lyrics.
“Positions” spoke to a new, mature set of fans that Grande has garnered over the past few years thanks to collaborations with well-known artists like Nicki Minaj, A$AP Ferg, Major Lazer, Victoria Monet, Normani, Future, Childish Gambino, The Weeknd, Ty Doll $ign, and Doja Cat.  Leading up to the album, Grande has been in the public eye for her relationship with Pete Davidson, the loss of Mac-Miller and a terrorist attack at one of her shows in Manchester.  The core of “Positions” revolves around taking tangible pain and making something from it.  The end message of the album is to own your pain, to let it make you stronger and to take more control of more areas of your life with this added strength.  
“She’s coming into a new style of music,” senior psychology major Alissa Vitale said. “Ariana has a combination of Hip Hop, R&B, and Pop all into one album.  This was a smart move because I feel this way, she could incorporate interest from all of her fan groups into one, great album.  Throughout her studio album collection, you can see her begin to grow and dabble with sounds.  This last album is the cherry on top.  On “Positions”, I feel like she literally wanted to show everything that she’s mastered and learned thus far.  As it is a goodbye to her first studio album collection, she introduces us to what she has in store for us.”
Aside from the self-awareness factors of her album, Grande speaks on her maturity through her sexual freedom, love, and self-sustaining strength. Riddled with sexual innuendos and references, Grande’s album celebrates the fact that her sexuality and sexual life is owned by her, showing she’s not afraid to take control and take things at her own pace. 
“This is a new Ariana,” senior Jayden Greensgrove said. “ Of course, I’ve grown up with the Disney star, more so known for her Disney channel work and minor songs.  I’ve always seen her in that little girl Disney light, even as she worked more and more with other artists.  I feel like this album, “Positions,” really displayed her growth and maturity!  Some of the lyrics had me yelling in agreeance, “Okay Ariana!”  She really showed her range with this album.  Even I was having flashbacks and love-dovey memories of certain ex’s I dealt with.”
“Off the Table,” a song made in collaboration with The Weeknd, spoke to the feelings of moving on, picking up, and learning to accept the love you deserve for yourself.  The lyrics sung between the two acts as a conversation between two lovers, deciding when it is the right time to enter a relationship.  On Grandes end, she was still picking herself up from her previous relationship, learning how to move on and accept what’s lost.  The new lover, The Weeknd, is waivered by her slow progression into entering this new relationship.  The two harmonized on being ready, and who will still be around when the time is right.  The song falls right in line with one of Grandes main themes of the album.  Learning to let go of what’s gone and deciding when it is the right time to begin anew.  The process of restoring yourself before you can give yourself a way to another person is emphasized, for the fate of the future relationship.  The lessons learned, pain gained, and love lost, all act as examples of how to not repeat that toxic cycle.  
Grande ends her album with “Pov”, a song in which she spent self-reflecting on the progress she’s made.  The song lays out Grande for everything she is, the good, the bad and the ugly.  She reflects over her past choices, experiences, downfalls, joyous moments, and everything that makes her complete today.  “Pov” explores the curiosity that one holds over their partner, the curiosity of why they love them so much.  It seems that if Grande could have a better understanding of all the reasons why her partner loves her so, she will learn to love those things, even what she considers ugly.  Attempting to understand why, the one person that you spend the most time with, wants to spend that amount of time with.  Putting a mirror up against yourself, picking through flaws, insecurities, even strengths trying to figure out why that person can be so in love with just you.  The song ends on a melodic note.  Grande having received confirmation from her partner that he’ll love her throughout all of her imperfections is the reason why she is in his point of view.  
“Positions” introduced a new era of music for Ariana Grande.  An era where she is fully in-touch with the emotions of her music.  A majority of her songs are set to give off certain feelings of togetherness, love, even flashbacks of pleasurable moments due to her playful writing.  This album sets her apart from her five recent studio albums.  This indicates the potential that she is just beginning to tap into.  Just when you think that you can master one field, another door for mastery opens right up again.  Having grown up with her fans, mainly from her Disney days, the album was able to resonate well across listeners.  Most have been through bad relationships, tough decisions, low points, pleasured in new ways, or received love they never knew was possible.  Grande drew on the emotions of the heart and flesh to compromise this album.  Being that love, is an unconscious, non-mediated action, the outcomes can be drastic.  Whether the end may be good or bad, Grande shows you how to pick up and move on, or own it and wear it with pride.
