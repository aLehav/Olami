Diet culture on social media is something that many people have become very concerned with. The concern mainly has to do with the negative effects it has on people, as well as why it is important to recognize that it can be unhealthy to turn to social media for dietary advice. 
Diet culture has to do with what people are eating, what they look like, and tips on how to work towards looking a certain way. Although this can be a very helpful tool when it comes to encouraging others to work towards their own goals and providing healthy and nutritional ways of being on a diet, it can be very harmful to peoples’ mental health at times. 
Many times, people compare themselves to what they see on the internet, even if they are looking at someone with unrealistic body features. Many celebrities edit their photos or photoshop pictures before posting them, and this in turn causes people to see those pictures and work towards an unrealistic body goal. It can be extremely damaging to peoples’ mental health as well, since certain body features are impossible for people to obtain. 
“I think that it is really upsetting that so many compare themselves to what they see online, even if they don’t realize they’re doing it. It can really decrease a person’s self-esteem and I think it’s important that people start to notice all of the false things that are online,” sophomore business major Gabrielle Previti said. 
Many times, especially on TikTok, people will post what they eat in a day. While this can be informative for people to see, what people don’t realize is that everyone eats differently and what one person should eat might not be what another person should eat. People assume that just because something works for someone, it should work for everyone, when that is not the case. 
Everyone is different and everyone has different needs and many think that too many people have lost sight of that. 
“It bothers me when people just copy what someone else is doing because they have a certain goal they’re trying to reach. Individuality is important, especially when giving your body what it needs and I feel like diet culture causes so many eating disorders and people need to be aware of that,” sophomore business major Rebecca Margolin said. 
Eating disorders are a very big concern when it comes to diet culture on social media. 
Since so many people are setting unrealistic body goals and losing touch of what they need to do for themselves, it can cause severe eating disorders and it is important for it to be addressed. 
“I really hope that people start to see how diet culture can be dangerous because it’s just going to get worse and more problems are going to occur,” Previti said. 
Many feel as though if people are going to post their diet advice online that they should do it in a healthy way and let the viewers know that some things work for some body types and other things work for others. People believe that this will raise awareness and prevent diet culture on social media from becoming worse.

Television was invented in 1927 by Philo Taylor Farnsworth. It was a brand new way to entertain yourself. People would watch shows such as “I Love Lucy” and “Happy Days” with delight in order to distract themselves from their woes.
Then came cable television in 1948. Instead of a broadcast signal, television programs were now transmitted to subscribers by cables, as per the name. Those who were willing to spend a few extra dollars each month could now access even more shows than ever before. Shows like “The Walking Dead,” “Breaking Bad,” and “Game of Thrones.”
However, a new era of television is upon the nation: the streaming era. HBO Max, Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, and more. They’re here, and they’re here to stay. A veritable slew of programming for the savvy shopper.
Students have taken notice of the differences between streaming and cable.
“In my opinion, the biggest difference between cable and streaming is the variety of shows and movies that are offered on both, along with the fact that streaming services allow shows and movies to be played instantly. I believe streaming is more cost efficient than cable as long as the individual enjoys the offerings of the streaming service,” sophomore business administration major Brandon Humbert said.
It’s true that with streaming, one can get as many shows as they want, even shows that are no longer airing on television. These shows can be watched on demand. It appears that the days of there being nothing good on television are over. Streaming seems to be a better option than cable.
Tyler Cooper from Broadbandnow shared some interesting statistics on the subject. The average cost of cable is about 45 to 135 dollars a month. The average cost of streaming is about 20 to 70 dollars a month. After the promotional period, cable’s price increases around ten to forty dollars a month. Streaming prices do not rise as often. Cable also has equipment fees, while streaming does not. Cable requires a contract more often than not. Streaming usually requires one as well. Cable has a broadcast and regional sports fee of 10 dollars or more a month. Streaming does not have this fee.
Cable offers 150 to 400, and more, channels. Streaming offers 30 to 95. Cable offers access to premium networks with some plans. Streaming offers the same thing for an additional monthly fee. Cable has an on demand library of mostly reruns, while streaming has an on demand library of original content.
So pricewise, streaming is a better option for students. It also doesn’t charge equipment fees, broadcasting fees or require contracts. It also offers less channels than cable TV, but the channels it does offer are more popular.
There’s another reason why streaming would be more popular among college students. If one wants to watch cable in their dorm room, they have to lug a heavy cable box around. However, if someone wants to stream television, they only need an internet connection.
Evidence shows that streaming is a better option than cable. However, at the end of the day, it’s really a matter of personal preference.

Around the world, there are thousands upon thousands of children that need healthy parents and a healthy home. Luckily, there are a significant number of potential parents looking to adopt and subsequently save the life of a child in need. While at face value this seems like a match made in heaven, adoption agencies fail to mention the toll it takes on your bank account as well as the copious background checks and timetables that affect people’s ability to adopt a child. So much so in fact that it forces many to adopt out-of-country, which can lead to a plethora of other problems. 
According to Adoption.org, there are over 400,000 children in the United States that are part of the foster care system. In 2015 alone, there was a peak of 670,000 children waiting to find a home. So, if there are so many children in need, why is it so expensive to adopt?
“The range for an adoption [with an] agency is from $5,000 – $40,000…with the average being $28,000,” according to Adoption.org. This price is equivalent to purchasing a new car.
“The one thing I know about the adoption process is how expensive it is, and this is one thing I have an issue with, because there are so many children looking for loving homes and so many parents willing to give them that, but money gets in the way of [their ability to adopt a child,]” junior marketing major Karolina Stolarczyk said. 
While there is mild disdain for the adoption process in the United States, the other side of the argument claims that the difficulty to adopt a child is indicative of adoption agencies wanting to make sure the children are placed with the right families.
“The United States adoption process can be long and complicated, but it exists to make sure a family can meet the needs of a child and are fully ready. In the end it is only there to benefit and make sure each and every child can experience a stable loving family,” junior mathematics major Nicole Catanzarite said.
Due to the difficulty many potential parents have in adopting children in the United States, there are some who choose to go outside the country to adopt a baby, which can be a pressing topic. The programs facilitating out-of-country adoption are often religious, and therefore have no requirement to be regulated. This means that the possibility of adopting a child who was taken from their parents is heightened. Although this precedent exists, students on campus are unaware of these practices overseas. 
“I don’t see an issue with going beyond the US borders because this also helps the kids in the [other] countries to get into good and loving homes,” Stolarczyk said. 
Whereas many are uninformed about overseas adoption practices, the consensus is moreso universal on the topic of the adoption process becoming easier and less expensive.
“I think it is harder to adopt in the United States because it is in high demand. But I believe the challenge and complexity of the system really deters who is and isn’t ready to create and provide a family for a child,” Catanzarite said.
Although the adoption process in the United States is pricey and extensive, those on campus believe it is necessary in order for the children to find the right homes. 
“I wouldn’t want [the children] to go into an abusive home that doesn’t care about them, I think it should be slightly easier but also not easy enough that adults can take advantage of the system,” Stolarczyk stated. 
With the current guidelines of adoption sometimes being complicated enough to deter parents not committed enough, there are still opinions about pricing and difficulty that individuals at Post would like to see change.
“The money is always the factor that messes things up. if money wasn’t such a big issue, I feel as though a lot of loving parents would take these children into their homes,” Stolarczyk said.
In today’s capitalist society, money is always the obstacle for assumed happiness – adoption process included. 
“A couple who wants to start a family but cannot financially afford going through the process then providing for a child under that financial strain is unfair. The process should be less on money and more on who can and wants to provide a new family for a child,” Catanzarite said. 
There are several ways to spin the adoption argument. Some can say that the process is too pricey, while others say the process is in place for children to find the right homes with the right parents. Some can say it is easier and smarter to adopt a child internationally, while others refute the idea based on their perception of out-of-country adoption agencies. Nevertheless, it should be a priority not only for the United States, but the world to find homes for these innocent children.

It is now week seven of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and it has been quite the disaster. There are now over 1600 civilian casualties and Russian President Vladamir Putin shows no signs of slowing down. Between train stations and civilian apartment buildings, the uncertainty makes it hard to guess their next move. The Ukrainians have held on though, leaving everything on the line as they frustrate the Russians and put up the fight of a lifetime.
Graduate advisor of political science and professor Dr. Michael Soupios gave his honest thoughts on Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine.
“Putin is an autocrat, he’s subsured the parliament, the constitution, the legal system, the court system, rule of law in Russia doesn’t exist anymore it is whatever Putin says it is and the same goes for the information and facts they are also unfortunately whatever Mr. Putin says they are,” he said. “He is concerned about his own loss of power and the last thing he wants is an independent legitimately Democratic and prosperous Ukrainian State.”
When talking about why Putin could be doing this, Soupios mentioned his egotistical mindset.
“This is about an interest on the part of Vladimir Putin in maintaining his own power and that’s what this whole thing is about in my opinion,” he said. “He is an autocrat, and power is a very seductive thing, the more of it you have, the more of it you want and this guy can’t get enough. This is the same pattern of the logic of a Joseph Stalin, the logic of an Adolf Hitler, and all of these other expansionist type leaders. There is also a term called Revanchism, what that means is one country wanting to regain territory it used to control but no longer controls. I think Putin is a revanchist and would like to reestablish much broader borders in terms of what used to be the Soviet Union, and that is something you can not allow because it will destabilize everything. You open up the risk of a much larger conflict. We let this man get away with too much in the 90s and are reaping the harvest in another bloody mess.”
Recently Ukraine announced they discovered a mass grave in Bucha, just outside of Kyiv. Soupios gave his thoughts on potential war crimes broken by Russia.
“There were standards laid out, and Russia is a signatory to these standards, the Geneva Conventions, and I don’t think beyond much reasonable doubt that they have violated the hell out of these conventions,” he said. “You’re not supposed to be bombing unarmed civilian populations, not supposed to be executing prisoners, not supposed to be using violence as interrigation, and theft and rape which we’ve heard is apparently going on, these are all clear cut violations of the conventions.”
Soupios gave an explanation to how the sanctions put on Russia could affect things in the country.
“In the long term, 3 months 4 months 5 months the sanctions will be very painful. Right now they still have an economic reserve on the ground and the people are being told they need to tighten their belts because this is a just war on their part, they’re defending their national integrity and all the misinformation,” he said. “So in the short term the sanctions won’t be effective enough for a regime change where people are really unhappy, but if this goes on month after month it would be another story. Russia has one asset economically and that’s the petroleum and natural gas industry. The funny but good description  is that Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country, the whole economy is a single factor economy which makes it very vulnerable.”
Soupios gave his predictions on the outcome of the conflict.
“I think in the end Putin loses,” he said. “Again it’s going to take time but the world will increasingly hang in there. In the short term we have to be much more aggressive in supplying weapon systems to the ukrainans, and apparently that is going on and we are sending more sophisticated stuff and the ukrainians are fighting for their homeland their country and are more motivated than the russian soldiers are. I feel badly for the Russian people and the Russian troops. These are young kids that aren’t professional troops who don’t want to be there and don’t know why they’re there. How do you stay motivated with people shooting at you when you don’t even know why they are? The Russian people deserve a better leader than this clown. 
Senior digital art and design major DeAnna Aguinaldo gave her thoughts on the war in Ukraine.
“The whole situation is devastating and horrific, it’s a little surreal to know something like this is happening in our day in age, it’s something you hear in history books,” she said. “Knowing there’s people my age going through this and losing their family members is so horrific. No one wants bloodshed and all this chaos and devastation, I think it’s really hard to control and I would hope the world powers could come up with a solution to stop Putin from any more of this because it is disgusting.”
When trying to think of being in the Ukrainian’s shoes, she mentioned how someone in her family went through something similar.
“My grandmother was from the Philippines, so when she was my age and even younger the Japanese were invading her country,” she said. “I remember her telling me how she felt and her parents had died before any of this happened but she was eleven or twelve going through that and had to take care of her younger siblings and I remember her saying how horrific it was and how they had to hide in jungles. Picturing what’s going on now, which is modern warfare, and modern technology I think that makes it even scarier because of the devastation that can be done in this day and age like nuclear warfare. I don’t know how I would feel, definitely devastated and scared not knowing if it would be my last day.”
When thinking of how this conflict could come to an end, she wasn’t too sure which way it could go.
“I’m not too sure how this will come to an end but if this does continue and Putin decides to go to more than Ukraine and take over more of Europe and maybe even do something with nuclear warfare, the whole world would have to really step in and take extreme measures to really prevent that from happening,” she said. “I think that’s a big worry, I don’t know if it’s really likely but you never know because everything has seemed unpredictable of late and the fact that if this is happening, anything can happen.”
Junior health science Major Miranda Ruiz described her thoughts on the Russian invasion.
“I think that it’s a difficult situation for everyone, especially because a lot of countries want to support Ukraine and Russia is kind of doing things that violate a lot of the agreements,” she said. “This situation has been going on for a long time, so it’s not completely surprising that it happened. I don’t know how it’s going to end up being settled, it’s just a bit of a crazy thing with everything that’s been going on the last few years, throwing a war on top of it isn’t surprising.”
When thinking of the people in Ukraine, she felt empathy while being grateful it isn’t a worry in the US.
“I don’t know if I could ever imagine it because here in America we don’t ever have to have that worry that someone will invade us because of our alliances with Mexico and Canada,” she said. “I don’t think I could ever expect that here, so it’s hard to understand how they feel but at the same time you also feel the empathy of fearing for a loved one or fearing for your family’s safety.”
Ruiz spoke on the fact that while Putin is in control, any settled peace is a hard thing to achieve.
“I don’t know if there is a solution to stop this, being able to sit down and talk is definitely the way to get over things,” she said. “But this has been going on for so long that I don’t know if there really will be a proper way to end it. The violence will most likely end with peace talks, possibly a ceasefire, but with what’s going on and with Putin in control, I don’t see any true peace taking place anytime soon.”

The newest Supreme Court Justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed on Thursday, April 7, after 23 hours of being questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee at her confirmation hearings, making her the first Black woman to sit on the top US court. Brown replaced the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer who is 83 years old.
Jackson was born in 1970 in Washington D.C but was raised in Miami, FL, where she graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School, continuing her education at Harvard University. Then after working as a staff reporter for Time Magazine in 1992-1993, she served as an editor for the Harvard Law Review while working to earn her law degree in 1996 from Harvard Law School. 
Jackson began her legal career with three clerkships, federal judges Patti B. Saris and then Bruce M. Seyla, as well as U.S Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer. After spending a couple years working as a lawyer in private practices after her clerkships, in 2003, Jackson joined the U.S. Sentencing Commission. In 2015, she started serving as a federal public defender in D.C, and representing detainees held by the U.S. in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Then, in 2009, President Obama nominated Jackson as vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission and was confirmed in 2010. 
Along with Jackson being confirmed, President Biden fulfilled a promise he had made on multiple occasions during his campaign, that nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court was something he was looking forward to. 
“And everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity, no matter what, no matter who they are…I’m looking forward to making sure there’s a Black woman on the Supreme Court, to make sure we in fact get every representation,” Biden said during a Democratic presidential debate on Feb. 25, 2020.
The next day, he mentioned it again at a press conference.
“As president, I’d be honored to appoint the first African American woman to the court because it should look like the country. It’s long past time,” he said. 
Professor of political science and pre-law advisor Jeremy Buchman mentions that Jackson’s impact will make a difference demographically.
“She represents a first and there’s great value in having her experiences and it’s valuable for people to see someone in power like that, it makes them think “I can do that too”,” Buchman said.
Not only will Jackson be the first Black woman on the bench, but she will also be the first public-defender to serve as a Supreme Court justice, as well. Her experiences with being a public defender has caused a lot of disagreements with the parties on the committee. Republican Senator from Arkansas, Tom Cotton, received criticism for his remark implying that Jackson will sympathize with the views of some of her past clients, including the detainees at the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba.
“You know, the last Judge Jackson, [Justice Robert Jackson] left the Supreme Court to go to Nuremberg and prosecute the case against the Naziis, this Judge Jackson might have gone there to defend them,” Cotton said on the Senate floor Tuesday, April 5.
Buchman thinks that Jackson will actually make a difference but with time, and one of the reasons being because of her history with being a public defender.
“I do think she will make a substantial difference, not so much immediately in the ideological breakdown of the court, it’s a pretty solid 6-3 conservative majority now, and her replacing Stephen Breyer isn’t going to change that,” Buchman said. “But to me, her impact comes in two ways: one is demographic, and the other part has to do with her background as a public defender. This is a professional experience that is not found on the Supreme Court and it gives you a very different perspective as to how the criminal justice system works.” 
With Jackson now becoming the 116th Supreme Court justice, showing the most bipartisan of the couple recent Supreme Court nominee votes that have been seen. Amy Coney Barrett had 52-48 votes, two democrats in favor of her, and Michael Cavanaugh with only one democrat voting in favor of him. Jackson’s final vote tally was 53-47, with three Republicans joining all of the Democrats in favor for her to a lifetime appointment as a justice on the Supreme Court. With one of the Republicans being Sen. Mitt Romney from Utah.
“I have concluded she is a well-qualified jurist and a person of honor. While I do not expect to agree with every decision she may make on the Court, I believe she more than meets the standard of excellence and integrity,” Romney said in a statement clarifying his support on Monday, April 4.  
Prior to Jackson being confirmed as a justice, only five women and two Black men have served on the Supreme Court. With Jackson being the first Black woman to serve, history is in the making. President Biden mentions how honored he is to be a part of this significant moment of history in a Tweet on Thursday, April 7 after Jackson’s confirmation was announced.
“Judge Jackson’s confirmation was a historic moment for our nation. We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible Justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her,” Biden said in the Tweet.
