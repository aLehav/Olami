Planning for this year’s Spring Fling kicked off at the beginning of the spring semester. The Association for Campus Programming (ACP) is currently making arrangements to book and host events for the annual Spring Fling week and concert.
Students received an email in the beginning of February with a list of suggested artists for this year’s Spring Fling headliner. Attached to that list was a voting poll. Based upon the results, ACP will determine who they will invite for the concert. ACP does everything they can to satisfy students’ wishes for the concert.
When they can’t book the artist receiving the most votes, they move down the list from their poll until they find an artist who is available to perform.
ACP received a budget of $75,000 to $100,000 from the Student Government Association (SGA) to book an artist that will attract a majority of students for this year’s concert. Sarah Knapp, a junior Sociology major and member of ACP, said that ACP searches for artists who are popular enough to appeal to students, while also focusing on up and coming artists to remain within the budget. “We take into consideration the cost to book them, as well as how many tickets they will sell once they’re here. Student appeal also plays a factor. We want to attract attention to the concert and the artist performing in it,” Knapp said.
Two different emails with different options were sent out to students. The first email was sent Feb. 9, and consisted of artists from the hip hop and R&B genre. Because students wanted more diversity, and some artists were not available, ACP sent out the second email with different options. Overall, the options included artists such as The Weeknd, Tinashe, Panic at the Disco, Gavin Degraw, Jason Derulo, and Wiz Khalifa.
Students have mixed opinions on this year’s options. Simone Severe, a junior Criminal Justice major, was not too enthusiastic about the changes made in the second email. “When the first email was sent, I liked the options that were given because there were artists such as Migos, 2 Chains, or Wiz Khalifa, that I was excited about seeing live. When they sent out another list that changed the first set of artists, I honestly didn’t like any of the new options,” she said.
Carlos Abreu, a junior Marketing major, was also disappointed about one change that was made on the list. “I was excited about seeing The Weeknd, so naturally I was upset when he wasn’t included [on] the new list.” However, Abreu does not feel completely let down by the changes. “Some of the artists that were suggested were likeable to some extent, but I would have liked for other up and coming artists to have been considered.”
Like Abreu, other students do not believe there is enough diversity in the new list of options. “I know it is probably really hard to get popular artists, but I would like there to be more variety in the genres available,” said Korey Hennegan, a junior Computer Science major. “In the first email, I voted for Mac Miller and Schoolboy Q, and for the second I voted for Alesso. I thought there was a good range of artists on the first list. Not so much the second list,” Hennegan said.
Although there have been complaints among students about the Spring Fling options, Spring Fling is all about the atmosphere, according to Severe. “I have gone to both Spring Fling concerts during my time as a student here, which were both fun. In my first year, I went to see Miguel perform, and in my second, I saw Big Sean and Jhene Aiko, which I enjoyed the most. Both concerts were able to set [a] different type of mood for the crowd, but both were still entertaining.”
Abreu, who has never attended a Spring Fling concert during his time as a student at Post, also agrees that the atmosphere is what makes or breaks Spring Fling week. “Although I have never attended a Spring Fling concert, I would like the entire week of Spring Fling to consist of not just of one thing, but several different events and activities; it will be spring after all, and the campus should be more lively and busy,” Abreu said.
Knapp confirmed that ACP will be hosting several different events during Spring Fling week. “None of the events we’re planning are final [yet], and are subject to change, but students can possibly expect a barbecue, a party, and/or a comedy show.”
As of now, ACP cannot confirm the date Spring Fling week will take place, or when they will reveal the artist selected for the concert, as ACP is still working on negotiations. “We book the performer when the Tilles Center is available. Once we have decided on an artist, we place a bid and wait for them to accept or reject the offer. If they accept, then we finalize plans; if they reject, then we continue searching,” Knapp said. She also mentioned that they will keep students informed through social media and flyers around campus.

From March 9-15, LIU Post students will be on spring break. For some, it is a time to either go home, or go on vacation. Other students will be staying in the dorms. What will be open for them on campus? And what will be closed?
The Campus Life staff, including all resident assistants, is working throughout the week. Also, all student services departments will remain open during regular business hours, according to Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life.
Here is a breakdown of other hours:
Dining Hours (March 7 to March 14)
 Winnick Hall – Closed
Hillwood Commons Café – Open Saturday, March 7, to Saturday, March 14
8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Monday, March 9 to Friday, March 13
8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
All other food service facilities will be closed for spring break.
Pratt Hours:
Saturday, March 7 – 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Sunday, March 8 – 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Monday, March 9 to Friday, March 13 – 7 a.m.- 7 p.m. Saturday, March 14 – 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Sunday, March 15- 10 a.m.-9 p.m.
Athletic Games
LIU Post is hosting our Conference Basketball Championships during the break. We won’t know if our teams will be in these games or what time they would be playing until after their quarterfinal games on March 4, according to Berthel.
Saturday, March 7 – ECC Semifinal games (men and women) at Pratt noon – Women
2:30 p.m. – Women
5 p.m. – Men
7:30 p.m. – Men
Sunday, March 8 – ECC Championship (men and women) at Pratt noon – Women
2:30 p.m. – Men
Some students feel that the limited food-related options during the break are problematic. “It stinks for students on campus who can’t go home, and don’t have a car,” said Jessica Rashbaum, a junior Digital Arts and Design major. “[Hillwood Commons Café] closes at 6 p.m., and Winnick is closed. Students who are staying on campus without a car will have to spend a lot of money on [food] delivery all week long.”
“I didn’t know that Winnick wasn’t going to be open [during spring break],” said Megan Draghi, a junior Childhood Education major. “[Hillwood Café] is going to be open, but it’s a bit of walk, and it’s pretty cold outside.”
“Aramark has extended the hours of Hillwood Cafe to remain open until 7 p.m., Monday through Friday, during spring break. They indicate a variety of grab and go options available for students,” said Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students.

LIU Post has recently implemented a Digital Early Warning System, which alerts students of their poor performance in classes. Faculty members can report student progress to a portal on My LIU, which automatically sends a message to the student and the student’s success coach or enrollment services counselor.
According to Lori Knapp, LIU’s Deputy Vice President of Academic Affairs, this system is meant to increase student awareness about their performance in classes. “It is understood in higher education that student persistence and retention are linked to engagement and early success in the classroom,” said Knapp.
Although this system has been in place since day one of the spring 2015 semester, it was used university-wide for undergraduate students in the fall of 2014. In addition, a smaller pilot program ran in the spring of 2014. According to, Abby Van Vlerah, the Dean of Students, the online system replaces a paper system of warning notices that was in place in a few departments, such has athletics and the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP).
Throughout the course of the semester, there are several points when a professor can flag a student. There is no specific grade that causes the warning to be sent, but faculty members can report a student based on participation, attendance, assignments, and midterm progress.
Benjamin Gerdes, Assistant Professor in the Media Arts Department, is one of the professors who has used the new system. So far, he has only used the alert system for the attendance aspect. Gerdes believes that the system is not perfect, but has the potential to be of assistance to a student.
“It would probably be very difficult to develop a progress system for all classes, but in general, it’s good to have a progress marker,” Gerdes said. The only drawback, according to Gerdes, is the limited feedback that the professor can send to the student and academic counselor.
Senior Broadcast major Yaritza Abreu agrees, and thinks a larger amount of feedback would benefit the students. “I would prefer a descriptive comment; I don’t want an operator telling me I’m failing,” said Abreu. Abreu is indifferent to the delivery of the message, but believes it is beneficial, saying, “It gives students a chance to pick up their slack.”

LIU Post is hosting the first blood drive of the spring 2015 semester on March 3 and 4. The blood drive will take place in the lower level of Hillwood Commons between 8:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. The Office of Campus Life is coordinating the blood drive with the New York Blood Center.
The goal of the drive is to collect 700 units of blood. “The New York Blood Center holds three blood drives over four days each semester, and one to two additional times in the summer,” said Jennifer Low, the director of Marketing and Advancement Operations at LIU Post.
Donations vary, but usually the single days have between 30-60 donations, and the two-day drives in October and March get between 150- 200 donations. Senior Political Science major Melissa Jean plans to donate. “I encourage people to do it because it’s a half hour out of your day, it saves lives, and it’s nice to give back,” Jean said.
To be eligible to donate, you must have photo ID, be a minimum weight of 110 pounds, between the ages of 16 and 75, and you cannot have gotten a tattoo in the past 12 months. Students should eat well and drink lots of fluids prior to donation.
To schedule an appointment to donate, or if you would like more information on the blood drive, contact Campus Life at 516-299-2800. If you have any medical questions, call the New York Blood Center at 1-800- 688-0900. To volunteer at the blood drive, contact Campus Life Coordinator Arianna Livreri at Arianna.Livreri@liu.edu, or visit her office in Hillwood Commons room 217.

On April 22, LIU Post is hosting its third annual “Post and Beyond” showcase, an event that provides graduate and undergraduate students the opportunity to present their own research to their peers. The event will be held in the Tilles Center, and is open to all students who wish to attend.
The one-day showcase features PowerPoint and poster board presentations created by students to explain their own independent research on a topic of their choice. With help from a mentor, typically a faculty member or an independent mentor, students present their research work. Students from outside the university may attend the showcase, as well. By asking questions and viewing the conducted research in person, undecided students or those having second thoughts on their career choice can find an area that interests them.
“It is similar to a poster session held at a professional research conference. Students attending may see a [profession] that they would like to be involved in,” said Glynis Pereyra, the Assistant Dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, and the organizer of the event.
According to Pereyra, students must take certain steps to have their work presented at “Post and Beyond.” First, they must fill out an application on the “Post and Beyond” section of the website, www.liu.edu/CWPost/Academics/Research/PostBeyond. This application includes all the basic information such as first and last name, student ID, and of course, the subject of research that the student wishes to present.
“These applications are reviewed by a committee of faculty.” Pereyra continued, “and if the committee believes the student should revise their proposal for research, the students are asked to revise the proposal.” After receiving approval from the committee, the student, with help from their mentor, begins the research. The seven to nine week period between approval and showcase day (which varies since some project ideas are approved before others) is grueling, as students are asked to provide extensive research on their topic, while at the same time adjust their research into a brief but detailed presentation. On showcase day, “Students and faculty attending the event get the chance to see the hard work and the important work that our students do throughout the process,” Pereyra said.
Ismael Nehhas, a sophomore Chemistry major, attended the “Post and Beyond” event last year. “The program really helped me see where I was at when it came to my career choice, and sort of [re]affirmed to me that chemistry was the right choice for me in large part because of the chemistry presentations on display at the event.” Sal Greco, a sophomore Chemistry major, showed his appreciation for the event. “I think it’s awesome that students go out of their way to showcase their findings with other students.”
Twenty-nine students participated in the showcase last year, with topics ranging from American history, to the branches of science, Western literature, and politics. Although no students have applied for this year’s “Post and Beyond” program yet, Pereyra said that students have until March 8 to register. “I remain optimistic that we won’t just match our number of attendees from last year, but we will surpass that number,” she said.

Amy Freedman, a Professor of Political Science and International Studies, received the “The United States and Southeast Asia: Past Legacies, Present Issues and Future Prospects” Borg Research Award at Columbia University.
Freedman, along with two professors from Columbia and one from Seton Hall University, submitted a proposal to the Borg Foundation for more money to develop further programs at Columbia on U.S. – Southeast Asian relations. This award is accompanied by a $321,000 grant that will be used over the next three years to host two conferences at Columbia with two post-doctoral researchers.
The goal of this award is to relate past experience to present issues in the field of U.S. and Southeast Asian relations. Winning the award was important to Freedman because it ensured she would be connected with scholars around the world who researched in the same field as her.
Freedman’s freshman year in college was a tough adjustment since she realized how hard it was to make new friendships, however by sophomore year, she declared her major in Political Science. At Barnard College, she was given the opportunity to discover what she was interested in by taking many classes that were not core requirements. Her favorite courses were those focused on Asia.
“I am most interested in current, modern questions, and trying to understand questions about democracy and human rights,” she said, explaining her major. Throughout college, Freedman explored different jobs, still unsure as to what she wanted to pursue in her future.
Following college graduation, Freedman spent several months traveling around Southeast Asia to continue her research: mostly in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and China. She was given the opportunity to interview government officials, other professors, and people in these countries.
“It was a very humbling process because I was asking other people to share their experiences with me, and I couldn’t pay them in return, other than buying them breakfast or a coffee,” Freedman said about her experience in Southeast Asia. “It was also an exercise in deference, respect, and being appreciative that people will share their time and knowledge with you.”
Freedman is the author of several published books about her research. The first book she wrote, published in 2000 and titled Political Participation and Ethnic Minorities, was based on her dissertation. She studied ethnic Chinese minorities and the way they organize themselves in their community to assert and protect their interests. She provided examples from her research in Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as case studies in the NYC China Town community, and a Chinese community in Monterey Park, Calif.
“The thing about writing academic work is that it is research based, and very few people will read it,” Freedman said. Although she enjoyed researching, she didn’t exactly enjoy writing, as this was less of a creative project. The dissertation took close to two years to complete, and editing it into a book manuscript brought the project to a total of three years.
Freedman worked at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania for ten years, while her husband worked in New York. They had a commuter marriage and wanted to change that, so Freedman left her job to come to LIU Post and teach International Studies and Political Science. Freedman pegged Chinese politics as her favorite class to teach, mostly because the students come in knowing very little about China.
“China is the only place where you will see two hundred years of change happening so quickly,” Freedman added. “It is the most mind- boggling place to study in the twentieth century.”
Freedman has created an open environment for her students to grow as individuals. Mark Satira, a senior with a dual degree in Political Science and Public Administration, said that Freedman was able to make complex topics easy to comprehend and interesting to learn about.
“Dr. Freedman also nominated me for a fellowship with the Center for The Study of the Presidency and Congress… and I was chosen to represent Post for this year,” Satira said. “This experience has really helped me gain more insight into this [field].”
Mona Kristiansen, a senior Political Science major described how hard it is to pick just one of Freedman’s classes as her favorite since they were all very interesting and engaging in different ways.
“[Dr. Freedman’s] International Relations class is the reason I chose to major in Political Science, because it made me realize how interested I am in international relations,” Kristiansen explained.
Satira was given the opportunity to research with Freedman for his current research.
“The work I did with her was very rewarding, and the experience has recently helped me get an internship position in the city,” he said. “I attribute a lot of my growth and maturity in my academic and professional career to the opportunities she has provided to me.”
Freedman is currently on sabbatical, researching nontraditional security threats in Southeast Asia, including threats from climate change, migration, food security, and the spread of new infectious diseases.

Models, designers, celebrities, but most importantly, new and unique clothes, are what make a successful Fashion Week. It’s officially the season of fashion in New York. London and Milan have already had their own Fashion Week, while Paris, starting on March 4, will be hosting the last fashion week of this season.
New York’s Fashion Week (NYFW), which was sponsored by Mercedes-Benz, ran from Feb. 11-19. Not even the cold weather could get in the way of what some people think is one of the city’s biggest events of the season. Designers took over the city with amazing runway shows that took place in many different locations, including Lincoln Center and studios around the Big Apple.
Ralph Lauren, Carolina Herrera, Michael Kors, and Marc Jacobs were just a few of the biggest designers that were present at NYFW. Celebrities including Gwen Stefani, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Beyonce, and many more, were there in the front rows attending one runway after the other to catch the latest trends.
It was very clear that fur was one of the biggest trends at NYFW this year. Not only on the runway, but also looking at pictures of the street style during the week; a lot of models and fashionistas who attended were sporting fur. Whether it was a fur coat or fur used on another article of clothing or accessory, fur was doubtlessly a key characteristic used by designers Ralph Lauren and Zac Posen.
Some fashion-forward students on campus are supporters of this new trend.
“I really love this new trend of fur. I think it makes an outfit look fun and interesting,” said Marianna Scalise, a junior Psychology major. “I’d rather people use faux fur, but other than that, I think this trend will be a big one for the rest of the winter as well as for the fall,” she
added. From the runway pictures on the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week website, viewers will find that most of the colors that were used by designers were not like the pastel colors or bright colors that have been used in the past. Instead, designers stuck to more neutral shades that they complemented with accessories. For example, designer Lucio Castro used the color that is referred to as Desert Sage, which is a greenish-gray color. Castro used this color for the pants and shirt, but added a pop of color by adding an electric blue jacket.
Ileana Lado, a junior Psychology major, usually keeps up with Fashion Week every year. “My favorite designers of this year were Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and BCBG Max Azria,” she said. “Some of the trends I saw on the runway that I feel are already very popular this season is turtlenecks and wide brim hats.” Lado also saw many designers incorporating ‘70s fashion into their lines, with flowy maxi dresses, vivid and abstract prints and wide leg pants.
From the entire week, Scalise felt there were two standout items. “Coats and boots, I feel, were the biggest thing I saw from all the Fashion Week craze,” Scalise said. “I love the ankle boot or the combat boots, which I saw a lot of in pictures from some of the runways. They are just the perfect shoe to really wear with any outfit, perfect for the winter and the fall.”
The biggest models of the week included Kendall Jenner, Karlie Kloss, and Gigi Hadid. But what actually left an impression was the diversity of models that participated in the shows.
“I saw that one of the biggest designers like Desigual, Nina Perdomo and even Kanye West, involved a big diversity of models,” said Kaity Lopez, a junior Criminal Justice major. “Actress Jamie Brewer made history by participating in Carrie Hammer’s show as the first model with down syndrome to walk during NYFW, which I think has to be one of the best things that happened during that week.”
Many shows involved transgender models, according to Lopez. A model with a skin pigment disorder and a teenager who was formerly paralyzed also participated in the runway shows. “Kanye West also had a lot of male and female models of different races and body types in the debut of his Adidas line,” Lopez said.
Scalise believes that NYFW was a success and she has been keeping up with fashion week in other cities, as well.
Lado agreed, “Fashion has always been a big part of NYC and I believe they always do a good job when the season comes around, with all the new fun trends that were displayed. It was a great week indeed.”

For the first time ever, the LIU Post cheerleading team will be competing at the National Championship Level. The team will compete in the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) College Cheerleading Championship in Daytona Beach, Fla., from April 9-11.
Thirty members of the team will compete against college teams from all around the nation representing their universities’ different divisions. To get invited to nationals, the cheer team had a cheer camp instructor fly in from Oklahoma to teach the team the material, and evaluate how well they preformed.
The cheerleaders practice a minimum of 12 hours a week, and also practice at events such as sports games, community service activities and tournaments at which LIU Post athletic teams participate. The team works on game-day skills, tumbling, stunts, jumps, routine, stretching, and or conditioning.
Right now, the team is in the process of choreographing the routine and practicing to prepare themselves for the competition. They are focusing on doing various exhibitions and performances to help them feel more comfortable and confident with the routine. The last performance the cheerleaders had in was during the televised games for the women’s basketball team on March 1 during half time.
“Being on the team gives you a sense of teamwork and unity,” Said Tia Henderson, one of the cheerleaders. “We have a lot of skills and potential and we are going for first place. We have had our ups and downs but we are a family and I wouldn’t trade them for the world.”
Coach Katelin Townsend has led the cheerleading team since just this past summer. “My favorite part about coaching is watching the athletes overcome obstacles not only in cheer but also in their academic/ personal lives,” Townsend said. “Being an LIU Promise Coach, I have gotten to know many of my athletes on more than just an athletic level. Teaching them to set goals and strive to be a better version of themselves is very fulfilling.”
The cheerleading team is hard at work to raise money for their trip. The total cost of the trip is $30,000, but their goal is to raise another $15,000-18,000. To help fundraise for the team’s participation in the national championship, you can access their Go Fund Me account at gofund.me/LIUPostCheer, or you can purchase a Spirit Calendar Fundraiser. This $10 calendar has pictures of the cheerleaders in various places on campus.
Townsend, along with the assistant coach, Matthew Blanar, took pictures and created the calendar themselves, and then sent it to a printing company to have it made. Each cheerleader is responsible for selling 30 calendars, but anyone who is looking to buy one and does not know any of the cheerleaders may purchase one in the LIU Promise Office, located on the second floor of Hillwood Commons.
The team is also starting a FanCloth Fundraiser in which anyone can purchase LIU Post-themed attire. The attire can be purchased by filling out a form from one of the cheerleaders or visiting the Promise Office. To find out more information regarding the fundraisers, you can contact Coach Townsend at Katelin.Townsend@liu.edu.

Michael Capobianco is in his last year in the Environmental Sustainability master’s degree Program. He has taken numerous online courses for fun through the University of West Florida to enrich himself in GIS.
Capobianco says his nerdiest confession is that he regularly browses the Help menu in arcMAP (the most popular GIS software), because it acts as a sort of encyclopedia for the program as well as providing general information about GIS.
He is currently learning Python, the scripting language used in GIS, and he wishes to incorporate GIS into his career. As his master’s Capstone Project, Capobianco is utilizing GIS to develop a solar heating plan for the Shinnecock Indian Nation in Southampton.
Please describe your Master’s Capstone Project.
For my master’s Capstone Project I am working on developing an alternative energy proposal for the Shinnecock Indian Nation of Southampton. I am specifically focusing on solar heating. I have been down to the reservation a few times to visit their museum as well as the Wikun Village, which is a recreation of what life was like for the Shinnecock in the past. I am heading down to the reservation this week to meet with more tribal members and continue my research.
Why did you choose to work with the Shinnecock Indians?
I’ve always had a keen interest in Native American topics, so being that the Shinnecock are the closest tribe geographically, I’ve spent time at their museum and annual powwow. They also drew up a climate change adaptation plan which really appealed to me and my interests. I’ve grown to admire their culture and the effort they put into educating people about themselves. I think it is important for non-Natives to remember that Native Americans are still here and not historical relics or mascots.
Once you finish your project, do you plan on putting your Capstone Project into action?
I would love to. Part of my project focuses on the economic impacts of implementing alternative energy systems on the reservations, which will explore funding. If the funding is there, and more importantly, the Shinnecock want to pursue the plan, I would love to see it in action.
What made you interested in GIS, mapping, and cartography?
I have always loved geography, which led to an interest in mapping and cartography. From a young age, I was enamored by maps. I still regularly get lost on Google Maps, checking out different parts of the world. I was not aware of GIS until I started the master’s program in Environmental Sustainability here at Post. In the two years since I was first introduced to it, I have grown fond of its power and capabilities, as well as its ability to allow us to visualize what would normally just be bland data.
Did you always know you would go into this field?
No. I started college late and majored in history. Halfway through my bachelor’s, I decided I wanted to add some natural science courses. The one in particular that led me to this field was called “Geology of National Parks.” I decided that I wanted to get into a field that blended hard, natural science with public policy, which is exactly what this program does.
What do you plan on doing with your future? Where do you see yourself working?
The future is both exciting and scary. The environmental field is growing, which is great. I’m not a 9-5’er by any stretch of the imagination, so I hope to piece together a career. My perfect career would blend teaching at an adjunct level, working/researching in the field to some degree, and devoting some hours to an environmental non-profit.
Eventually, I’d love to get out to the Pacific Northwest and do research on the Cascadia Subduction Zone and its implications for the coast… maybe for a PhD.
What was your favorite class?
I am really loving the class I am currently taking with Professor Kennelly, GIS Applications. We’re learning about remote sensing and processing digital images in GIS. The project that I’m most looking forward to is one coming up in a few weeks. Our task is to identify and report on an open access GIS software package. I’m excited about it because while ArcMap is really beautiful and diverse, it is also extremely expensive at $100 per year. So, I think it’s really important to find open access GIS software and I admire Professor Kennelly’s intuitive thought on including this project in the course.
Do you think GIS could have prevented the last Ice Age?
Assuming technology and populations were the same as today, I think that GIS would have been helpful in planning for the movement of continental ice sheets and glaciers. This would have helped in relocating at-risk populations to areas not impacted by the ice. For these same reasons, I think GIS is crucial in planning for climate change related events, such as rising sea levels and storm surge vulnerability in areas (like Long Island) impacted by stronger tropical storms.
If you had a chance to live anywhere for four months to pursue your passion for mapping, where would you go?
If my project with the Shinnecock is successful, I’d like to take it and apply it to bigger tribal areas, like the Pine Ridge Reservation (Oglala Sioux Tribe) or Rosebud Indian Reservation (Rosebud Sioux Tribe), both in South Dakota.
If you had a time machine, which explorer would you want to go back in time to meet?
Well, this is a loaded question. I’d meet Columbus and keep him in Europe. I’d convince him to go home to Genoa and tell him tales of the Taino and other Arawak people, who would go on to survive and thrive in the Americas as a direct result of him staying home.
What would the ideal environmental action hero be?
I think the hero would be a woman, preferably of color. She would not only do things like encourage recycling and energy efficiency, but she would also teach children to read, learn, and research on their own. She would teach them to rely on the scientific method for answers and teach them the importance of respecting all living things.

Patrick Kennelly is a full time professor who teaches the traditional Earth Science courses and GIS (Geographic Information System) in the master’s program in Environmental Sustainability. Kennelly is the co-director and online instructor in LIU’s Online Mobile GIS App Development Certificate Program.
When Kennelly is not teaching, he is the editor of the journal Cartographic Perspectives, and is on the editorial board of The Journal of Maps and The Cartographic Journal. He has also published his research in cartography in numerous other publications.
Tell us a little more about GIS.
GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems. It is basically the computerization of mapping and how to make maps using digital data. The class I teach for graduate students is called “Mapping Environmental Data with GIS”. People in the Environmental Sustainability program take this class as one of the requirements to learn the technology needed to map environmental issues and environmental sustainability.
What is an example of a project a student has done using GIS?
One example is research done by Carole Ryder, a former student, mapping remnants of the Hempstead Plains, one of the few natural prairies east of the Allegheny Mountains. She used GIS technology and satellite imagery to see where there were small bits of vegetation left over from before the settlement of Long Island. Her research results were written up in “Newsday.”
What have you done with your knowledge in GIS?
With GIS, one focus of my research is on how to represent mountainous terrain so that it looks three dimensional on maps. I have published a lot of articles on this as well, in several different journals. Some of my research is about taking old historical techniques and figuring out how to computer automate them.
What was one of your favorite projects with students?
One of my favorite projects with students and GIS was mapping the Wifi signal strength around campus. Kiichi Takeuchi in IT developed an application which we used to measure the strength. The students collected thousands of readings around campus with iPads and created hotspot maps. Students were able to do everything from collecting data and analyzing the data to develop heat maps; heat maps show where something is weaker or stronger.
What did you do before becoming a full time professor at LIU?
Before working at LIU Post, I worked for Montana’s geological survey and was responsible for all geologic mapping in the state. I was in charge of the survey’s GIS lab and managed the collected data in the GIS. Before that, I worked for an environmental and engineering consulting firm in Portland, Ore., as a GIS project manager.
What experience have you had with cartography journals?
I am the editor of Cartographic Perspectives and on the editorial board for some other journals. I am very involved in the society NACIS, and first I was asked to review other people’s articles. From there, I was asked to become the editor.
Why do you think it’s important that people study cartography and earth science?
I think it’s important because as quantitative thinking and critical thinking are important, spatial thinking is equally important. Cartography used to be a field used only by experts to make maps. Now people from all different fields are able to make exciting, interesting maps about many different things.
Growing up, did you always know you wanted to go into this field? 
I always loved the lay of the land, topography, so it doesn’t surprise me that I ended up in this field. I also have a background in geology and I like to explore rugged areas and look at rocks.
What is your favorite map?
My favorite map is from an early exploration of Western America, an early mapping effort of the area around the Grand Canyon. It was made in 1858, titled “Rio Colorado of the West.” If anyone wants to see an original copy, you are welcome to stop by my office in Pell Hall!
In your opinion, what makes a map beautiful?
I think a good map makes you stop and think. It lets you see an area in a way that you haven’t really thought of before.
If you could map anything in the world, what would it be?
I would just want to map mountains. Even in my academic research, I always pick a place where I have been and map it. I have made maps of the Grand Canyon, Mount Hood, and Mount Rainier. I would visit it to get an impression of the place, and use data from the internet to make the maps using GIS software.
I use my maps solely for academic research. I like to look at methods to reproduce historical methods of mapping. For example, one map I made was more of an example of using artistic technique, rather than cartographic technique, using cross hatching to map mountainous areas. It was even selected to be in a cartographic exhibit at the Harvard School of Design!

Spring Break is upon us, a much-needed recess for the students of LIU Post. Between the everyday stress of classes and work, a week off from school is a vacation in itself. Not all spring breaks carry the same stigma as the 2013 movie “Spring Breakers,” starring Selena Gomez. Some students at Post may be off from school, but still carry the responsibility of working, playing sports or seeing their families.
A week off from school creates free time for students. While some choose to go on a vacation or lay up in bed during spring break, other students opt to work and earn some extra cash.
Kaitlin Veygel, a junior Broadcasting major, said that she will be spending her week off working as a nanny for two young girls. Veygel has been the nanny for these two girls for the past three years. Although this may seem like a routine gig for Veygel, this year has definitely brought on some challenges, making this spring break a bit more difficult.
The girls are nine and three years old. The younger of the two was recently diagnosed with a heart condition, which requires more attention than before. With the new responsibilities that come along with watching a child with special needs, Veygel will have her hands full with the two girls over the break.
Some students who are on athletic scholarship at Post, or simply dorm from out of state, are all too familiar with airports. Shelby Townsend, a sophomore Journalism major and member of the golf team, will be one of those students spending Spring Break traveling. Her first trip will be with her teammates to North Carolina for a golf tournament.
After the tournament is over, Townsend will be headed to Florida for the remainder of the break to spend time with her parents.
Personally, I have never had a crazy spring break in Cancún with friends and end the trip with no recollection of our travels, returning home with one less friend than when I left; nor do I plan to start, at least not this semester, anyway. For me, spring break is about relaxation from school. Ideally, I would have off from work as well as school, but a week off from one stressor is fine enough with me.

Looking down at your syllabus, do the butterflies roaming around in your stomach make you feel sick? All you want is to get over this time period. Well, we are back in the midterm phase: a nightmare for all the students who are not good test takers.
Midterm grades are often responsible for a strong percentage of our grade and therefore students strives to give their best and suffer through panic attacks until it’s finally over. Worse, midterms are a huge downfall for students who are not good test takers. There are many students who perform very well in class and can manage to finish all their assignments, but have a phobia of taking tests. Many students believe they can do better in class if they didn’t have to take any midterms.
“When you’re taking your test, you feel so nervous that even if you have the correct answer, you start doubting yourself, which messes up your answer,” said Viren Khuller, a senior Business Management major. Lack of time becomes another issue during midterm week. Many times midterm dates crash with other assignments, which make it difficult for the student to concentrate.
“I feel like the timing for the midterms really affects other coursework, as usually all papers and assignments are due at the same time,” said Zaroon Ahsan, a senior Finance and Marketing major.
Anxiety is another reason why students become worried during midterms. Many students go through physical problems such as headaches, diarrhea, and excessive sweating, which increases their heart rate, according to http://www.anxietybc.com.
They also go through emotional problems such as depression, excessive feelings of fear, and need of crying. All of these symptoms interfere in their studies. Anxiety creates a signal in the mind that makes the brain unable to retrieve what’s stored in memory and often causes difficulty in demonstrating your knowledge on the test, according to the same website.
“I think a midterm is like a miniature final, but just as much stress,” said Marcus Scott, a junior Health major.
Whether it is a pop quiz or midterm, a lot of students go through major stress to get over it. We should always think of an exam as a way to find out how much we have learned individually. Remember to always strive for progress, not for success. If you don’t progress, you never succeed.

Spring break has come, which is only a phenomenon in England, meaning that it doesn’t exist back home. Alcohol, sex, loud music, and the freedom to do whatever I want were only things I could dream of, but it’s now becoming a reality! From London to New York, and now to Acapulco, where I’ll be spending spring break – how nuts is this?
For many of us who live in England, we don’t have exotic places surrounding us like you Americans do. Wales, Ireland, and Scotland don’t count as exotic destinations, right? No, I didn’t think so! About the most exotic you get in Glasgow, Scotland is a needle and a bottle of whiskey, which I guess may appeal to some readers. I’m joking! (Although I don’t think my Scottish friend Camo would be impressed of my analogy of his home city).
The opportunity to travel to places such as Florida, Cancun, Barbados, the Dominican Republic, or Acapulco is very rare for college students, so being close enough to afford such a trip is amazing! I am sure it is the same for many of us international students. Because we are so lucky to have the opportunity to go somewhere amazing – since we are young and it’s spring break – get out there and have an absolute blast!
This week has been full of ghastly midterms and tedious essays, so when YOU go, wherever that may be, find that equilibrium we spoke about last week and go wild, party, have fun; enjoy the nudity, alcohol, and loud music!
Remember when you return, it’s straight back into the swing of school, work, and studying, so don’t be that one student finishing an essay that’s due the Monday after spring break. Make sure that’s not on your spring break to-do list!
As I spoke about last week, stress is something that will catch up to you, and you will regret not having that rest. Therefore, we have to remember, for our own health and well being, to have an amazing break, right? This is what the time off is designed for: to make sure we, as students, don’t burn out or exhaust ourselves.
Take spring break 2015 by the scruff of its neck and have a fantastic time. You may not party every night during the days you are away, but make sure you’re appreciating your surroundings, and the people you are with – not that macroeconomics book, which could bore Scrooge himself!
If you guys don’t have the luxury of going away, there are still some cool things you can partake in over the break. Now that the weather is improving and the marvelous sun is making an appearance, the vast beaches Long Island has to offer really do become an option.
Of course, going to the fantastic setting of Manhattan is also a viable choice. Another quirky and interesting outing Long Island has to offer is its many breweries; there are so many to choose from, and learning the history of the booze you binge every weekend would almost make it a must to drink!

“Pink Freud,” a two-hour music concert, held in the End Zone in Hillwood Commons on Feb. 18, attracted a large crowd of students. This is the first time this event has been held, and was a collaborative effort between the Music Industry club, and the Psychology club.
Salvatore Ciulla, a sophomore Arts Management major with a concentration in music, formed the Music Industry club on campus in Dec. 2014. “The club’s goal is to raise money and awareness [for] artists, and to give a platform to under-promoted artists at Post,” Ciulla said. The goal for the collaboration was to “raise awareness [for] our clubs, and to show that we exist. The event had an amazing turn out,” he said.
The Psychology club is a philanthropic club, whose goal is to raise money and awareness for the psychology community by hosting events on campus. Jessica Kozakowski, the President, and Emily Smith, Vice President, met with Ciulla to plan this event. Emily Smith, the Vice President of the Psychology club, explained how the idea came about. “I met Salvatore in January this year during the leadership retreat. He told me about his new club, and we decided to collaborate to showcase [Pink Freud],” Smith said.
Daniel DeMarco, a junior Biology major, also met Ciulla and Smith at the retreat, and planned the event with them. DeMarco was joined by his two friends Ivan Poveda and Tyler Murphy, who do not study at Post, as the night’s musical act. The trio played acoustic/electric guitar and sang at the concert. They performed covers, such as a mash up of Taylor Swift’s “Blank Space”, Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA,” and The Black Eyed Peas’ “Where Is The Love.” DeMarco said they all had a lot of fun with the Black Eyed Peas hit. “It really came together well.” DeMarco, Poveda, and Murphy have played music together since Dec. 2013. “We are passionate about music and write songs together, talk music, encourage one another, and share great pleasure of getting to perform with each other.” DeMarco said. “I’m very fortunate to have the opportunity to perform and work with talented individuals bursting with creative energy.”
DeMarco found his passion for music when his parents introduced him to bands such as The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin. It fueled his desire to create music. “It’s an incredible feeling being able to write a song for yourself, and to have other people [relate] to it. I think it’s even more rewarding when individuals can see and feel the emotions that go into a musical performance,” he said.
The trio can be seen at open mic nights at coffee and tea lounges in Huntington and Wantagh. They have also planned another collaboration with
Ciulla and Smith for a second Pink Freud concert, which will be held in April.

The spring and summer seasons are a common time for music festivals. Music festivals such as Coachella, Vans Warped Tour, Electric Daisy Carnival, Boston Calling, and Bonnaroo are hosted outside, making the weather play in on the experience. Each festival has a different lineup, and attracts different groups of people, depending on their preferred music genre.
Coachella’s line up has a larger range of genres, from AC/DC to Drake. It is one of the most well-known and popular festivals to occur each year. With their wide range of artists set to perform, Coachella attracts a larger audience than other music festivals. Coachella, which takes place over two weekends, will take place from April 10-12, and from April 17-19 in Indio, Calif. Tickets for Coachella have been on sale since May of 2014, and are sold out.
Compared to other music festivals, Boston Calling will be smaller, but equally impressive. Some of the artists expected for this spring’s Boston Calling include Grammy winner Beck, Marina and the Diamonds, Vance Joy, Halsey, and Jack Black’s band, Tenacious D. The event will be held May 22-24 in Boston. Tickets are not yet sold out and passes range from $50-$75 for one-day, $135 for two-days, and $175 for all three- days. VIP passes range from $150 to $375.
Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) features electric dance music (EDM), and in previous years had headliners such as Calvin Harris, Martin Garrix, and Zedd in their lineup. This year, EDC will be on May 23-24 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Tier one passes for EDC are currently sold out; however, tier two passes are still available, and cost around $250. VIP passes for EDC cost more, ranging between $350 and $375. The line up has not yet been announced.
Much like Coachella, Bonnaroo’s line up has a wider variety of music than most music festivals, ranging from Mumford and Sons to Deadmau5, and caters to a larger audience. Tickets for Bonaroo are available for $325, and VIP passes are $1,525. Bonnaroo will be held in Manchester, Tenn., from June 11-14.
Vans Warped Tour caters to a different audience; their lineup tends to feature more pop rock, and hardcore rock music. In previous years, the lineup has included All American Rejects, All Time Low, and Kings of Leon. This year’s lineup includes Asking Alexandra, Boy Meets World, and RiFF RAFF, a rapper best known for his song “Tip Toe Wing In My Jawwdinz.” Vans Warped Tour, which travels across the country, will come to Jones Beach Theatre on Saturday, July 11. Tickets cost $52, but VIP passes are available for anyone who donates a pint of blood at select blood donation centers.
“It was the greatest experience ever,” said Mariel Bourie, a freshman Music Education major. “Meeting new people and getting to hear fantastic new music is truly something I will never forget,” Bourie said.
Tickets for the festivals can be purchased online on www. ticketmaster.com or straight from the festivals website.

Entering her eighth season as head coach of the women’s lacrosse team, Meghan McNamara has placed herself among the finest coaches in all of Division II women’s lacrosse. Winning two National Titles with the Pioneers in 2012 and 2013, McNamara is seeking her third National Championship in four years.
What are your goals and expectations for this upcoming season after your tremendous season last year?
A few of my goals are for our team to come together, get better every day and every game that we play, so it’s a step-by-step process for us. We just want to keep succeeding and we’re focused on our first game. Right after that we’ll focus in on our second game on March 4. Our long- term goals are winning the East Coast Conference Championship and getting back to the National Championship, but right now we’re just taking it one game at a time.
How do you feel about your new breed of talented players taking the places of players like Jackie Sileo, Katie Rotan, and Melissa Rohr?
I’m really excited for them to have this opportunity to excel. A few of them played with our senior class last year, so for the younger talent coming in to be able to step into their roles and have that opportunity to continue their tradition and legacy really excites me.
Since this is a younger team from last year, how has the team chemistry been thus far during practices and scrimmages?
The team chemistry has been great. All the players get along with each other and they hang out off the field. They push each other, they’re all very driven, and they love the game of lacrosse. The younger players coming together last season was great because now this is their team.
What’s the key to maintaining the high level of play from previous seasons dating back to the 40-game win streak from 2012-2014?
I think the players have more in them, and pushing them past their potential of where they are is key. It’s keeping those athletes unsatisfied.
The key to success is having that love for the game and letting them enjoy it because it’s about their journey and getting better with their teammates. So just remembering that the game is awesome and what you put into it is what you’re going to get out of it.
How did it feel to win ECC Coach of the Year for a third straight year?
It’s an honor, but every time I receive coach of the year, it goes out to my team and staff. My players and I wouldn’t be where we are without our staff. It’s a unit, so that’s what makes this award awesome.
What’s your favorite part about coaching?
The growth of the players and seeing them improve and come together as a family. That’s why I’m there; for them to reach the unknown and see how growing from that and the excitement along with the opportunities they’ve been exposed to. I think that’s the best part and its great watching these young women and seeing them grow.
Is there a team motto you and your players follow?
There [are] a few that have been in our tradition and our family since the program started. It’s obviously to do work, start the game strong and remain dominant throughout all 60 minutes. Our team motto changes every year so I can’t give away this year’s, but the passion behind the work has been very important.
How has your incredible success as a coach and former player rubbed off on you as a person?
I’m hoping that I’m still very open-minded because I was taught to be very creative, keep instilling and changing the game, take advantage of the people surrounding you, learn from them and keep growing with all my players and staff I’ve been surrounded by, along with my former teammates that are coaching and my experiences from my former coaches and bosses. Just enjoy the game!

This week, the men’s lacrosse team traveled down to Florida to take part in the North Florida College Lacrosse Face-Off at St. Augustine High School. The first of the two games took place on Friday, Feb. 27, and saw the Pioneers stroll past Saint Leo University 15-6.
To add to his thunderous start this season, junior attacker Matt Bellando scored an impressive game high six points. Junior attacker Matty Baccaris and senior midfielder Connor Drost notched three goals each while junior attacker Ryan Slane added two of his own. The stats on the defensive end showed that there could have been even more goals, but Saint Leo goalie Dave Moore had an impressive game-high 16 saves, highlighting the prowess of the Pioneers attack force.
The second game of the weekend came on Sunday, March 1, verses Lynn University. It was again the combination of Bellando and Drost who topped the goal tally for the afternoon as the Pioneers combined for a 13-10 win.
Although the score line suggests a very close affair, until the final seven minutes of the match-up the Pioneers led 13-4, giving Lynn a long way back if they were to try to steal the win. Not without effort however, as the final seven minutes saw six Lynn goals. Despite a last ditch effort from Lynn, the Green and Gold owned a 37-28 advantage in shots, a 32-25 edge in ground balls, and won 15-of-27 face-offs, topping off a successful road trip. These two wins on the road served as the Pioneers third and fourth of the season.
Although off to a flying start, the Pioneers return to action for a re- match of last years NCAA Division II semi-final verses ECC foe and close neighbors, Adelphi University. The match will take place on Saturday, March 7, at Garden City, N.Y. Faceoff is set for 1 p.m.

Coming off National Championships in 2012 and 2013 and reaching the National semifinals last year, the women’s lacrosse team enter the 2015 campaign ranked fourth nationally in the IWILCA Division II Preseason Top-20 Poll. With the departure of several seniors, the Pioneers are now a much younger team consisting of several fresh faces.
The Pioneers (1-0) flipped open the book of the 2015 season on Saturday, Feb. 28, as seven different players scored for LIU in a 16-3 crushing defeat of Holy Family University (0-1) at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
Although the Tigers recorded the first goal of the contest, the Pioneers tallied 11 consecutive goals to secure a comfortable 11-1-cushion heading into halftime. Senior midfielder Jenna Pierro and junior defender/midfielder Honey Roche each collected three goals and one assist during the streak. Red-shirt sophomore attacker Emily Delaney racked up two goals and two assists, while sophomore midfielder Connor Bird pitched in with two helpers.
LIU Post dominated the entire first half and demonstrated excellent teamwork by sharing the ball, which gave them a huge advantage in time of possession. The hosts outshot its opposition 21-4 and held a 10-3 edge in draw controls during the opening stanza.
Bird netted two goals in a span of 4:34 to kick-off the second half, which completed her four-point outing. Roche and Delaney both finished with a game-best four goals. Sophomore defender/midfielder Cara Douglas registered her first goal of the year at the 17:41 mark of the latter stanza.
Pierro and Delaney both had terrific performances, each scoring a game-high six points. Roche totaled five points and one caused turnover while Douglas and sophomore attacker Stefani Vagelatos both had a three-point showing, scoring one goal and dishing out two assists. In her first collegiate start, junior goalkeeper Kasey Kephart made two saves between the pipes. Freshman netkeeper Olivia Kirk denied three shot attempts in the cage.
For the Tigers, junior midfielder Paige Settar had all three goals, but LIU Post had the ball on the visitors’ end of the field for a majority of the game, limiting scoring chances for the guests.
“We couldn’t wait to get back out there and Holy Family has improved in several areas,” said Meghan McNamara, the Pioneer head coach. “They have a lot of returning players who have had a tremendous impact on their team.”
McNamara and her squad open up East Coast Conference play today when they clash with Molloy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. The opening draw is slated for 3 p.m.

On Friday, Feb. 27, the women’s basketball team (17-11) honored three graduating seniors when they hosted the Daemen College Wildcats (11-15). Junior center Nyasia Davis turned in a career performance as the Pioneers bested the Wildcats by a score of 70-65.
Davis earned her 16th double-double of the season, snagging a career-best 20 rebounds and pouring in 17 points. Not to be outdone, senior guard Chelsea Williams dropped a game-high 29 points and brought down 11 boards for her first double-double of the season.
The Pioneers jumped out to a quick 6-0 lead to open up, but the first half was a back-and-forth battle that ended up being that way until the halftime horn. At the break, the Pioneers led 33-31.
In the second half, the Pioneers were powered by the three-ball and big shots from senior guard Ashley Castle and junior guard Jalyn Brown. With just over three minutes left to play, sophomore guard Essence Casey hit a lay-up to give the Pioneers a lead they wouldn’t relinquish. Casey finished with six points while Castle added nine of her own.
On the same night, the men’s basketball team (16-12) also honored their seniors and then played host to the Wildcats from Daemen College (18-10). The Pioneers were led by an incredible display of shooting from the field and cruised to a 79-56 victory.
The Pioneers jumped out of the gate quickly and grabbed the early lead, but the Wildcats battled back to draw within four. With the score at 18-14, the Pioneers went on a 25-6 run to grab a commanding 43-20 advantage. The home team dominated down low, forced a lot of turnovers, and got a lot of second-chance opportunities. That’s a recipe for success.In the second half, the Pioneers built their lead to as much as 29 points and were in cruise control until the final horn sounded. For the game, senior guard Isiah Stokley had a game and season- high 19 points while senior forward Tyuan Williams had 18 points and six boards. Senior guard P.J. Torres totaled 14 points, seven rebounds, and seven dimes, as well.
The next slate of games both teams came on Sunday, March 1. The Pioneers concluded their 2014-2015 regular season with a matchup against the Redhawks from Roberts Wesleyan College and the game, which was broadcasted nationally on the CBS Sports Network, proved to be a good one for LIU as they earned a hard fought 69-61 victory.
The Pioneers were once again led by Williams, who scored 25 points, dished out seven assists, and brought down five rebounds while Davis posted yet another double-double with 15 points and 15 rebounds. Castle added 16 points and eight boards, as well. The Pioneers led for most of the first half, but an 8-0 run by the Redhawks to close out the half cut the Green and Gold’s lead to 30-23 at halftime.
The second half was much closer, as the visitors trimmed the deficit to a mere one point multiple times. Brown drained a three pointer to put her squad up four points and clutch free throw shooting down the stretch from Williams and Castle preserved the victory for the hosts.
Next up for Coach Deirdre Moore and the squad are the NYIT Bears in a play-in game for the East Coast Conference Championships in Old Westbury. Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. tonight.
Later that day, the men’s basketball team played host to the Roberts Wesleyan College Redhawks (10-16). Torres totaled 13 points, but his most important basket came with seven seconds left as he drove and nailed a running jumper to give the Pioneers a one-point lead. A three pointer that was off the mark by the Redhawks gave the Pioneers a great win.
The Pioneers played a very well rounded first half, shooting 50 percent from the field and playing great defense. The Green and Gold forced 15 turnovers and held the opposition to a field goal percentage of just 39 percent. At the break, the Pioneers led 40-29.
The second half was much different though, as the Redhawks began to find their rhythm and play cohesive basketball. They improved their shot selection and got out in transition more often, which led to easy baskets at the rim.
Junior guard Mike Stone led the charge in the second half for the Redhawks with nine points and three assists. The Pioneers countered with junior guard Devon McMillan who matched Stone in points in the half.
From the 3:17 mark, the scoring changed hands five times. The Pioneers led by one when the Redhawks nailed two free throws to put them ahead. Then senior forward Charles McCann converted on lay-up to take the lead back for LIU. The Redhawks however, answered with a bucket of their own to re-take the lead at 64-63. The Pioneers turned to Torres and he delivered with a huge basket to give the Pioneers the one-point gritty victory.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and his squad return to action when they take on the Lions from Molloy College in the play-in game for the East Coast Conference Championship. Tip-off is also set for 7:30 p.m. tonight.

Baseball is right around the corner. That’s right, teams have already reported to spring training in Florida and Arizona and one can smell spring right around the corner.
There is a lot of optimism by many fans in the New York area for this upcoming season because it may in fact be the season where the Mets overtake the Yankees in on-field production and winning. The back-to-back seasons of missing the playoffs hasn’t gone over well with the fans in the Bronx, and meanwhile, the Mets have built a quality club one town over built on young starting pitching.
With Cy Young candidate Matt Harvey, last season’s Rookie of the Year Jacob deGrom, and the improving youngster Zack Wheeler, the Mets have a solid core of starters that can take the league by storm and carry them to their first division title since the 2006 season.
The pitching will be there all year for the boys from Queens barring injury, but the big questions lie in the hitting. Can David Wright bounce back from a rough 2014 campaign? Will Lucas Duda show the same power he did last season? Can Curtis Granderson find his home run stroke from 2012? How will Michael Cuddyer adjust to his new team and new ballpark?
The questions are all legitimate, but one thing is for certain: the Mets will need consistent and timely hitting to be in contention and be there in October. Perhaps the most important hitter to the Mets success will be second basemen Daniel Murphy. The table setter sported a .290 average last season and scored 80 runs on a team with very little productivity behind him. Murphy will look to build on his 2014 season and lead the Mets to new heights.
After missing the playoffs for the second straight year, and without their beloved captain Derek Jeter, the Yankees are in uncharted waters. The Yankees, once the epitome of every team in baseball according to some, have now fallen into mediocrity (or at least by their standards).
Offensively, the Yankees are led by a group of veterans who are at crossroads in their respective careers. Mark Teixeira has been injury prone over the last couple of seasons and he wants to find his 2009 form, (his initial year with the Yankees). Carlos Beltran will look to rebound from an injury plagued down last year while Brian McCann will try and put it all together with a year under his belt in the Bronx.
Perhaps their most consistent hitters patrol the outfield in Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner. Both players can easily score 100 runs and swipe 50 bases, but the key will be staying on the field, as both players have had injury problems over the last two seasons.
I would also be remised if I didn’t mention the most polarizing athlete in New York, Mr. Alex Rodriguez. What kind of production will the soon to be a 40-year-old third basemen/designated hitter/former steroid user provide? Nobody knows, and that’s a scary thing when the Yankees have over $25 million committed to him for another three years.
The suspect aging offense is part of an overall theme for the Yankees as their pitching staff is more of the same. With a less dominant C.C. Sabathia, who is coming off knee surgery leading the pack, the Yankees staff isn’t the sharpest tool in the shed. Following C.C. is the much talked about Japanese phenom Masahiro Tanaka, who is coming of a tear in his UCL. After him comes the young duo of Michael Pineada and Ivan Nova, both of whom are not strangers to the disabled list. If the Yankees can hang their hats on one thing, it is their pitching at the end of games. The Yankees pen is headlined by flamethrower Dellin Betances who struck out 135 opponents in 90 innings last year to an ERA of 1.40. Andrew Miller, Adam Warren, and Esmil Rogers round out the stacked relievers in the Bronx.
Both the Mets and the Yankees have a lot of questions surrounding their franchises and those questions will have answers when the season gets underway in early April. Baseball is here… are you ready?
