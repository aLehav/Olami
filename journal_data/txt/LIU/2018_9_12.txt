Doctor Panos Mourdoukoutas, chairperson of the economics department, argued in an editorial published by Forbes.com on July 21, 2018, that Amazon would be an effective replacement for libraries. In the article, which went viral, he suggested that with the rise of “third places” such as Starbucks and streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, libraries are no longer the only important place to receive the services they have rendered.
“Amazon have created their own online library that has made it easy for the masses to access both physical and digital copies of books. Amazon Books is a chain of bookstores that does what Amazon originally intended to do; replace the local bookstore,” Mourdoukoutas wrote.
The article angered readers and has since been removed from the Forbes website. Mourdoukoutas did not respond to The Pioneer for comment.
“Public libraries are important for those who don’t have access to the Internet and I personally think holding a real tangible book in your hand is better than something on the Internet,” Sarah Fiore, senior psychology major, said.
“The only person I think could speak from the heart and say or imply that libraries are a waste of taxpayer money is one with no heart,” J Fordsman, a sophomore psychology and criminal justice student, said. “They [public libraries] are a staple of life for the lower and lower-middle class. To outsource such a valuable asset to a soulless, corrupt corporation like Amazon is like signing the death warrant for all lower and lower- middle class in the United States.”
University President Kimberly Cline responded to the editorial in a letter to Forbes on July 26, five days after its posting. In her letter, she wrote from her childhood experience that libraries are invaluable.
“I can say without hesitation that I would not be the person I am today if it were not for my library and the librarians who nurtured my imagination,” Cline wrote. “While times change, today’s libraries and librarians are performing an equally vital service for the next generation of young minds.”
Michael Morea, the director of the Gold Coast Public Library, defended public libraries as valuable services that are in fact quite cheap.
“Amazon is a great source for people to get things, but libraries are more than just a bookstore. We do provide these materials, we save the community money by providing these materials. For every item that we purchase, more than one of us uses it, so we save money in the aggregate by spending less per use than by each of us needing to purchase the material individually on Amazon,” Morea said.
“There is space for both of us. The library is still an important place for the community to be able to come together, to pool their resources and be able to save each other money for learning, recreation, lifelong learning, and more,” he continued.
Morea noted that Amazon is helpful for providing items immediately, but that it has a cost. “If I’m looking to sample new authors, discover new materials, trying to do research and I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for, paying for every single bit of that use gets expensive to me as an individual.
Here in Glen Head, our residents pay ten dollars per hundred of their assessed tax value. Many of taxpayers pay less than a $100 per year. We do feel that we provide our services at a reasonable price.”
Many Post students utilize the campus library frequently.
“I feel more focused when I’m [at Post Library] and it’s like a change of scenery to do work, instead of just staying in my room. There’s always people there to help with anything, and the text line is really helpful,” Taylor LaPorta, a junior elementary education and TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) major, said.
Rachel Portnoy, a junior education major, has good things to say about Post’s library.
“I feel the library is very useful. It helps me a lot when writing my papers and doing projects for my classes,” Portnoy said.

Academic departments throughout the university were consolidated over the summer, with multiple departments merging under one chairperson.
In the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS), the political science, history, economics, and sociology departments have been combined, and will now share one department chairperson instead of four separate chair people. The English, philosophy, and foreign language departments have also combined into one. In the College of Arts, Communication & Design, the music department has merged into the department of theater, dance, and arts management.
Dr. Amy Freedman, former political science chairperson and professor, who left the university over the summer and is now a professor at Pace University, said that consolidation efforts began with the appointment of the new dean for CLAS last year.
“When [Dean of the CLAS, Dr. Nathaniel Bowditch] started at LIU last year, he immediately identified that many of the CLAS departments were quite small,” Freedman said.
“He told us that he felt having departments with three or four faculty members made no sense, both from a financial standpoint and from a programmatic one. He convened many chairs meetings to discuss consolidation within CLAS.”
Freedman said that department chairs, with one or two exceptions, were not on board with the consolidation plans.
“In March or April, [Bowditch] told us that instead of departments merging with one other department or two, that in Hoxie Hall all four departments [political science, history, economics, and sociology] would be merged. Faculty will get together at the start of fall semester to choose a chair for this combined unit,” Freedman said. “We have filed a grievance with the union regarding this, but I doubt it will get far.”
As for the effect on students, Freedman said that the plan will not be student-friendly.
“I fear that there will be a fair amount of chaos this semester, as it is unclear who can sign off on things, and who will interface with students, advisors, and admissions,” she said.
Dr. John Lutz, a professor of English and newly elected chair of the consolidated English, philosophy, and foreign language department, differs from Freedman in his view of consolidation.
“I began speaking with the philosophy chair, and I kind of liked the idea [of consolidation]. I actually think that this change will be good for humanities on campus,” Lutz said.
Although the departments have already consolidated, students on campus were unaware of the changes.
Gabrielle Greco, a senior music major, said that she hasn’t heard anything about
the consolidation of her program. However, she said that if consolidation occurs, she would be nervous for the state of her department.
“I’m a music major. I don’t know any [faculty] in theater,” Greco said. “The music department is tight knit. We know everyone in it who could potentially be chair. Having someone not in the music department [become chair], someone who doesn’t know our schedules and needs, could be dysfunctional.”
Philip Atkins, a sophomore history major, echoed Greco’s fear. “I’d be pretty disappointed [if consolidation occurred]. I don’t feel that the subject’s needs would be adequately met,” Atkins said. “[The departments] would be better split, each focusing on one area.”

“Greek life – I really believe there is a home for everyone on our campus,” Joseph Vernace, LIU’s associate director of campus life, stated. This fall, a fifth sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, will join the campus Greek organizations.
The instillation of Kappa Kappa Gamma
into LIU’s Greek life is currently underway. While sororities and fraternities do not have their own houses, students interested in KKG can apply to live in the South Residence Complex, where they will live among other members of Greek organizations.
KKG, like the other Greek chapters on campus, requires applicants to have at least a 2.5 out of 4.0 cumulative grade point average. Students who are a part of Greek life have to be enrolled full time, taking at least 12 credits every semester.
In addition to being academically successful, future KKG members must agree to abide by LIU’s 4 values: fellowship, service, leadership, and scholarship. Once accepted, sisters are expected to complete at least 10 hours of community service, and raise $2,500 towards a national cause.
There are no recruited members at the start of the semester, but KKG will come participate in Greek recruitment with the other fraternities and sororities on campus.
Although TV shows and movies often depict Greek life negatively, with examples of hazing gone wrong and racism, the office of campus life works to negate that perception.
“Within LIU Promise, [we] always push [Greek life members] to challenge all the negative stigmas. We take a lot of preventative measures when it comes to reducing the risk of hazing environments. We always preach the importance of inclusion within their organizations,” Vernace said.
KKG will be open to all female students, regardless of their creed, race, sexuality or economic status.
While the university does not offer money to economically disadvantaged students who are interested in Greek life, KKG is a national organization and may offer scholarships or grants for prospective students.

The Writing Center has a new home on the second floor of Humanities. During the summer, the Writing Center moved from Humanities 202 to a larger space in Humanities 223, the former offices of the foreign language department.
Mary Pigliacelli, the director of the Writing Center, said her main concern was the space. “We were hoping to get a little more space,” she said.
“We will sometimes have several sessions at once, and will have to work on top of one another.”
Anthony Heider, a second year employee and second year grad student for theater at the Writing Center, is pleased with the new space. “This room will provide a lot of opportunities for tutors and students not to feel overcrowded when working together,” he said. “The last room was nice, but much smaller, which some could see it as a good thing though,” he added.
The Writing Center was created to help students with their writing demands, such as essays for a class or scripts for student films. A large number of students visit the center, especially during midterms and finals.
With the new space, Pigliacelli will conduct weekly or bi-weekly workshops for students to get a better understanding of their writing skills and techniques. The first workshop was held on Tuesday, Sept. 11. workshops are open to all students.
Finding the new space won’t be hard. “I’m going to have signs in the hallway directing people to us,” Pigliacelli said.
The Writing Center is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m on Tuesdays and from 10 a.m to 4 p.m. on Fridays. Students can call 516-299- 2732 or email Post-WC@liu.edu for more information and to schedule a session.

The resident assistants of each dorm on campus prepared to greet incoming freshmen, preparing three weeks before orientation. They were trained to assist new students beginning their college educations.
Yadiel Corporan, an RA of Post Hall, said he recognized the significance of the position. “One of the biggest things that stood out to me was the importance we play in [the new student’s] transition from high school to college,” he said. “Just being able to answer their questions and provide friendly communication shows them what they are in for and the opportunities coming their way.”
The RAs worked as orientation leaders for the new students. After the freshmen moved in, they were divided into cohorts, each directed by two leaders.
The cohorts were led from session to session by their orientation leaders, participating in ice breaker games and other scheduled activities.
“With the free time we had, we played games as often as possible,” John Vituci, Queens Hall RA, said. “I got to build a great rapport with my kids in my orientation group. Go cohort seven.”
The RAs also filmed an introductional music video to the upbeat song “All Night,” by Icona Pop.
“The video took approximately two weeks to film, as it involved moving to various areas around campus,” Louis Copertino, Kings Hall RA, said.
The orientation leaders performed skits at the end of Orientation Idol, led the freshmen in ghost tours around campus, and supported their respective cohorts in the Pioneer Games.
Adam Silverstein, Riggs Hall RA, said he did everything in his power to make the event memorable for cohort 10.
“As orientation leaders, we try our best to keep up a fun, energetic, enthusiastic spirit, help the new students get comfortable with the school and get them to want to be involved and engaged on campus,” he said.
Silverstein made it very apparent that facilitating a new student body does not stop after orientation. “We make it known that we are always here for the freshmen if they ever need anything after Orientation is over,” he said.

LIU Post welcomes eSports and one of its most popular games, “League of Legends,” to campus this semester.
The program has gained so much public attention that university athletic departments have started to offer it. Although it is an entirely new concept for LIU Post, Athletic Director Debbie DeJong said the school will follow what other conferences are doing. eSports will compete in the same NCAA conference as the rest of LIU Post’s traditional fall athletic teams.
DeJong said that the eSports program will provide “the non- traditional student athlete” with “a way to compete.”
The program is new and therefore will start out small, with no scholarship money. However, DeJong is positive that since the school already knows that there are students interested, that scholarships will be a future element to the program.
The Korean eSports Association, first launched in 2000, and started to grow in popularity around 2010. The purpose of the association was to bring skilled, eager gamers to a larger platform where organized competitions could take place, hopefully working towards becoming a nationally recognized event.
eSports, as it is commonly known, stands for “electronic sports,” and provides an opportunity for gamers to connect and partake in online gaming competitions.
The popularity in competitive and high-level gaming at the collegiate level caught the attention of two students taking part in the “Gamers: Design Your Own Video Game” program at the Summer Honors Institute at LIU Post during the week of June 8, 2018. Matt Linn and Mark Mitri both agreed that eSports will give college students a great opportunity and is something “out of the ordinary” that may help people find their interests.
As for the potential success of the new program, Linn said that it really depends on individual skill level. Mitri agreed and added that the effort put in is also a variable, but overall there’s an equal opportunity for every player.
Neither student said that they would consider joining an eSports program when they get to college. Mitri and Linn believe that it’s “not particularly smart to join now” since it’s so early in its development at most schools.

Recent renovations have been completed on Brookville Hall, one of the resident buildings located on the east side of campus.
Built circa 1970, Brookville Hall is relatively new compared to the rest of LIU Post’s campus, with most buildings constructed around the time of Post’s founding in 1954.
Despite being newer than other buildings, according to Beth Funfgeld, the service response coordinator for the Department of Facilities Services, the building isn’t perfect. Brookville had a common set of issues that were reported by students to the Department of Facilities Services, including clogged drains, dying door lock batteries, and tripped fuses.
Funfgeld, who receives every concern about the residence halls, has never had a general com- plaint about the quality of life in Brookville Hall.”The building as a whole — that’s in good shape,” Funfgeld said.
Though incoming resident hall students will experience improvements to their dorms this fall semester.
“Renovations were made to do what’s best for future and present Pioneers,” Matthew Blanar, associate director of campus life, said. “Our updates in the hall are really just to make sure we’re providing for our students and giving them the amenities they need here.”
As soon as Brookville residents moved out after the spring semester, the Department of Facilities Services got to work.
The tile floors on the first level of the building were replaced with polished hardwood floors, an extra lounge was created in place of an old office and has been furnished with new couches and a flat screen TV, the resident assistance office was put in a more accessible area, and more vending machines are slowly being added.
As Blanar puts it, these recent renovations help “bring students together to kind of create that community within the resident hall that [staff members] always strive to build. Everything will be set, ready to go for when they come in the fall.”

Former U.S. president George W. Bush will speak on campus on Thursday, Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. in the Tilles Center as a part of the ongoing “Conversation with a Congressman” series. The event is hosted by former congressman Steve Israel, who is head of the LIU Post Global Institute. President Bush will give a lecture on “the challenges facing our nation in the 21st century and the power of freedom,” according to the Tilles Center website.

Last year, the Global Institute brought former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, and General David Petraeus to speak on campus. Danielle Oglesby, the Chief Operating Officer of the Global Institute, said the events had “very large student turnout.”
Dr. Amy Freedman, former chairperson of the department of political science and international studies, described the Global Institute as a welcome addition to LIU Post.
“The Institute certainly brings more recognition, prominence and awareness to LIU,” she said.
Freedman also detailed the benefits of the Global Institute that are directly felt by the students.
“Bringing these well-known, powerful people to speak on campus definitely engages students and opens their minds, I think,” Freedman said. “I hope it makes them look beyond just the borders of the United States.”
The Global Institute, housed off campus at University Center, was founded in January 2017 by former Congressman Steve Israel. The institute hosted United Arab Emirates Consul General to New York, Majid Al-Suwaidi, for an “Executive Breakfast” on Wednesday, Sept. 5. Congressman Tom Suozzi of New York’s third district, which includes parts of Long Island and was once represented by Israel, will speak on Monday, Sept. 17 in another “Executive Breakfast.”
Spaces at the Executive Breakfasts are reserved for paying members of the Global Institute and their guests. LIU faculty may receive open invitations as space allows. The cost of an individual Global Institute membership ranges from $1,000 for the most basic package to $100,000 for a deluxe corporate sponsorship package.
The Global Institute will also host its second annual State of Anti-Semitism conference on Thursday, Oct. 4. The keynote speaker will be Timothy Snyder, author of “On Tyranny.”
The inaugural conference, held last year, featured leading Holocaust scholar Dr. Deborah Lipstadt of Emory University, Israeli Consul General in New York Dani Dayan, LIU Post Campus Rabbi Yaakov Gruenstein, and former Congressman Steve Israel. Just as with the Executive Breakfasts, members of the Global Institute receive priority access over any LIU students or faculty to the conference this fall.
LIU students can purchase $15 tickets for the Bush event from the Tilles Center Box Office. Tickets will also be distributed free of charge to various LIU faculty and departments, from whom students may be able to receive free tickets.

The Coalition for Conservation club has new pumpkins and sunflowers growing in the campus garden. Students in the coalition worked over the summer to care for the garden to prepare for the harvest this fall.
Both the pumpkins and sunflowers were planted in late June, and will be used for ornamental purposes. The sunflowers will be harvested this month, and the pumpkins in late September into October. Various lettuces, kales, mustards, radishes and spinach were also planted in the summer.
“The purpose of the Post Student Garden is as a forum to teach about where our food comes from and for students to get a hands- on experience growing vegetables and eating fresh, organic food straight from the garden,” said Vic DiVenere, associate professor of geology for the soon-to-be Department of Biology and Environmental Science, and the club’s faculty adviser.
“The greens grew the most between May and July. We would usually have a club member or Dr. DiVenere stop by two to three times a week to water the entire garden, and harvest the greens in the middle of the week. In mid-July, the pumpkin plants, marigolds, and sunflowers started to sprout, and have since then been blooming full of color,” Grace Kim, a freshman nursing student and one of the Coalition’s members, said.
The Coalition has high hopes for the use of some of the garden’s plants. They plan to harvest and eat the plants, teach others how to grow them and share recipes using the home grow veggies.
“In the near future, it would be ideal to have the club market the harvested produce from the farm and have them sold and provided to Post students, faculty and to our dining halls for use in on-campus dining. Hopefully, we will continue to add new varieties of fruits and vegetables to diversify the garden into a greater edible landscape,” Kim said.
The goals for the club are to promote further student engagement, maintain the farm during the cooler seasons, lessons on the science behind soil irrigation methods, pest management and other ways to educate the student body about preserving the earth.
The garden is located east of the Facilities Services and Public Safety building.

The common read is an annual piece of literature assigned to incoming freshmen. The new tradition aims to connect members of the incoming class and inspire involvement among the campus community,
Dr. John Lutz, chairperson of the English department, helped start the tradition in 2012.
“Every year before the incoming class comes in, we get together a group of faculty, staff, and students, Lutz said. “We usually have about a dozen [book] possibilities, we narrow them down by reading them.”
The common read is meant provide the freshman class with an experience allowing them to connect with their peers.
“They are making a difficult transition from high school to college,” Lutz said. Group assignments and discussions will be a large part of the curriculum, and students will participate in a service project to conclude the experience.
In previous years, the freshman classes have read pieces such as “Look Me in the Eye” by John Elder Robison, who came to speak to the students about his experiences, and “The Pursuit of Happyness” by Chris Gardner. The selection for 2018, “Just Mercy,” by Bryan Stevenson, is Dr. Lutz’s favorite common read thus far.
“Just Mercy” details Stevenson’s life as a young lawyer fighting for innocent people’s freedom from the criminal justice system. The author is currently involved with enacting lynching memorials in the southern United States, something Dr. Lutz appreciated. “He has done an enormous amount of good work,” he said.
“We look for books that have some kind of relevance to the world and that are going to present students with a unique experience,” Lutz said. The committee aims to choose pieces that depict a character overcoming obstacles or encourages readers to look at the world with a different perspective. In this case, students will be asked to take a deeper look into the criminal justice system and the issues that lead to incarcerating members of society.
The LIU faculty hopes this piece empowers and impacts the incoming freshman class. “[We want students to] embody good characteristics and virtues that will make the world a better place.” Ashley John, interim Director of Campus Life, said.
“I think this book could be an instrumental piece in encouraging civic responsibility amongst students,” John concluded, “You are our future.”

One may describe the scenery at LIU Post as something straight out of a movie, and this statement isn’t far-fetched. The campus is sought after by location scouts to be the setting for TV shows such as Madam Secretary, Blindspot, The Blacklist, Royal Pains, The Following, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, along with movies such as The Rewrite. These productions have provided unique opportunities for students, especially those majoring in film.
“Our mission is always to give our students what we call experiential learning and hands-on experience, so as a result they could participate by either covering the story, or interviewing an actor, or even playing in a scene,” Rita Langdon, executive director of strategic partnerships and campus operations, said.
Film students gain useful skills by taking part in a professional filming process, and working with widely-known actors such
as Kevin Bacon, Hugh Grant, Idina Menzel, Marisa Tomei, and Whoopi Goldberg will look impressive on resumes.
“It’s not uncommon to have famous actors walking around eating lunch with our students…you have students who want to learn about the filmmaking industry, how TV shows are produced…” Langdon said. Some students are paid to act as extras.
The campus has varying locations that could depict a wide array of film settings. “Maybe [scouts are] looking for an athletic scene so they like the fields, or maybe they’re looking for mansion scenes so they like our mansion, or they’re looking for hospital scenes because we have the nursing simulation lab,” Theresa Duggan, director of conference services, said. The campus’ stables were used to depict the Irish countryside in “The Blacklist,” and the simulation lab set a hospital scene in “Royal Pains.”
The filming has had a positive impact on many students. Even if they aren’t majoring in a field related to film production, seeing well- known actors around campus can be a treat for anyone.

Editor’s note: This series will follow the summers and semesters of the returning members of the Post Theatre Company.
Few students are lucky enough to start college knowing what they want to do. For many students in the musical theatre department, their goals are set. Heading into senior year is daunting for all, but for Post Theatre Company’s (PTC) upperclassman, it’s when their hard work begins to pay off. For one senior musical theatre major, Paul Bakey, the coming semester is going to be a huge one.
Bakey explained that attending Post wasn’t on his radar in 2014 when he auditioned and applied for schools. It took a chance meeting with a Post representative to rocket this school up in his ranks.
“I was cornered in an elevator with Logan Dewitt, who was at that time a freshman at Post,” Bakey said. “She said she was recruiting for LIU Post and I thought, well I’ve never heard of that place and mentally checked out.”
Despite this, he ended up auditioning for LIU Post. David Hugo, Bakey’s freshman acting professor, told him about the program and his interest in Bakey. “
After talking to [Hugo] about it, and doing some more research, the school quickly shot up to one of my top choices,” Bakey said, “and when I got the acceptance letter is was almost a no-brainer!”
Bakey is well-acquainted with the PTC stage. After having performed in several of PTC’s productions, Bakey reflects back to his first casting in Trojan Barbie at the beginning of his sophomore year.
“I was a little nervous because I was making my PTC debut, the first show of the season.” He wanted to make a lasting first impression on the freshman class.
Bakey took on a keystone role in Spring Awakening last year playing Moritz.
“I’m just really proud of that role, it was a dream role of mine and I’m so happy I got to take on that challenge last year,” Bakey said.
Looking forward to his senior year, Bakey will be making his directorial debut assistant directing Ellen McLaughin’s Iphigenia and Other Daughters’ on the mainstage during the fall 2018 semester. “I’m really excited to be on the other side of the table,” he said, “it’ll be really nice not to have the pressure of being on the stage.”
With the “real world” of acting just around the corner for Bakey, he does see his time at Post as incredibly fruitful and is thankful for all the opportunities PTC has provided him with.
“All of our main stage directors are usually guest directors who are working in the city, great contacts!” He said. This past summer Bakey was a member of the Woodstock Playhouse in upstate New York, run by Post alumni Randy Conti.
Senior theatre production major Katherine Keaney speaks of Bakey’s success both on and off the stage. “It’s hard being a musical theatre major, so being successful in this program is not only a reflection of his talent but also of his time management,” Keaney said. “Most MT kids are taking 20 plus credits a semester.”
As for the future, Bakey is uncertain as to what it may hold.
“My first love is theatre and performing, that’s all I ever wanted to do,” he said. “But I don’t want to limit myself to just performing.”
Bakey advised freshman PTC members to trust in themselves and their ideas. He suggested that if one trusts in their process, that’s where the magic will happen.

Following the success of numerous films by the Marvel Cinematic Universe over the years, Insomniac Games has created a new PlayStation-exclusive game entitled “Marvel’s Spider-Man.”
The game is a third-person role-playing game where you explore a more gritty and dangerous version of New York City while trying to defeat a gang called “The Demons.”

The story of “Marvel’s Spider-Man” is not based on the current Spider-Man portrayed by Tom Holland. Instead you play as what looks like a mix between Andrew Garfield and Holland – but that’s subjective.
In most super-hero games like “Deadpool,” you don’t get to play as the hero’s alter ego. However, in “Marvel’s Spider-Man,” there are parts where you play as Peter Parker and another version of Spider-Man later on.
Visually, the game looks beautiful. Insomniac Games made sure that you were able to swing from the Financial District in Manhattan to Harlem and everywhere in between. One of the things the game allows you to do is explore New York City. This is encouraged by rewarding experience points whenever you take photos of New York City’s famous landmarks, such as the Empire State Building.
In the movie, “Captain America: Civil War,” Spider-Man is given a suit that shows more of an elastic, woven texture and in “Marvel’s Spider-Man,” Insomniac Games made sure that this was present in the game.
The mechanics of the game are very similar to the “Batman: Arkham” series developed by Rocksteady Studios. Like the Batman games, Spider-Man is equipped with many gadgets and the combat is seam- less; punching one enemy flows perfectly into landing a backflip kick onto another.
After playing the game for hours, some of the missions can become a bit redundant. A common theme in the missions is stealth, so you’ll find yourself swinging from lamp posts and avoiding flashlights more times than not, but the cutscenes afterward usually make up for it.
The cutscenes surprise you every now and then; there are quite a few you wouldn’t expect to be there, like Parker’s date with Mary Jane Watson. The subject during the scene has little relation to the game’s main story, but Insomniac Games added the scene in there for fun.
While the storyline in “Marvel’s Spider-Man” gets tangled up at times due to redundancy, the overall graphics and visuals will make you want to swing all around New York City after a long day.
“Marvel’s Spider-Man” can be purchased on the PlayStation store digitally or at any game retailer.

It’s official, a March issue of Psychological Science, an on- line journal that accepts articles from doctors around the globe, confirmed that those who dwell over stressful situations and reflect on hardships regularly have more chronic health conditions throughout their lives.
The journal reports that their health negatively affects them or holds them back on a daily basis. While there’s no way to eradicate stress completely, there are factors we have control over, such as the foods we eat. That can help keep stress hormones, namely cortisol and adrenaline, low and by extension keep cells healthy and thriving.
Our body turns the foods we eat into fuel, but what many people often forget is that the body also uses food and its components to synthesize hormones that lead to immunity, metabolic rate and mood. For example, warm oatmeal as well as other complex carbohydrates, like whole grain bread and sweet potatoes, increase levels of a neurotransmitter called serotonin in the brain. This chemical is mainly responsible for mood, but it also affects appetite and sleeping patterns.
Another important component of food is its vitamin and mineral contents. For example, foods that have a higher amount of the mineral magnesium, such as spinach, brazil nuts, and quinoa, allow the body to combat muscle tension.
This may lead to less severe and frequent head aches, and may also help the body relax after times of stress.
What we as 21 century dwellers often forget is that fast food isn’t necessarily real food. Most of the in-and-out joints around these days use nutrient deficient beef and chicken laced with hormones and pesticides as well as vegetables that were grown on nutrient stripped soil. If fast food restaurants are your go-to, not only will you need to invest in larger pants, but you’ll find yourself feeling non energetic, sleep deprived and unfulfilled, since that type of food is simply
a form of quick lived energy. Instead, we should aim to include more omega-3 rich fish and nutrient dense nuts and seeds into our diets as a double edged sword against illnesses. Omega-3’s will protect the cardiovascular system from the negative effects of prolonged stress, while minerals from nuts and seeds will allow the body to maintain energy levels and aid in the elimination of harmful substances in the body.
Food is medicine, and once we begin viewing mealtime as
a time to build up our body’s defenses, everyday stresses and obligations will become easier to handle and cravings for sugar, caffeine and other stimulants will slowly disappear. After all, humans weren’t designed to need a 4 p.m. cup of coffee to get through the day. The foods we eat should be enough to sustain us and if they’re not, a diet adjustment may be in order.

And just like that, we are back! I hope you all enjoyed your summer and are ready to take on the school year. Each semester gives us the opportunity to be a better version of ourselves. I know we end up falling back to the same old routines, but I want to challenge you to share your ideas this year. But what exactly do I mean?
A common thing I’ve heard recently is, “Don’t be shy, that was exactly what we were looking for.” This has not just been said to me, but to others as well. We get nervous to speak up about ideas that we have because we don’t want to be wrong. So, we let that fear of being wrong hold us back from achieving things or even inspiring others. It can happen at work, in school or even during an interview.
Something important for everyone to understand is that even if you say something you believe isn’t inspiring or important, it could be to someone else. Your small piece of advice to someone could have been the life changing news they needed to hear. Even I have read a sentence in a book and said to myself, “This is exactly what I needed to hear today.”
That is why it is so important to believe in yourself and your thoughts. This can also help when you are at a job interview or at school. When the person interviewing you or your professor asks you a question, you might become hesitant about your answer. But once you reply, they tell you that it was exactly what they were hoping to hear! Have more courage in what you are saying.
If you are someone who is kind, compassionate and wants the best for others, then you have a beautiful mind. People with beautiful minds inspire others with what they have to say. The next time you have an idea that you believe will help the situation or that can help others, please speak up. You never know who you will inspire and that can give another person the courage to speak up, as well.

“The great thing about rowing is you don’t necessarily have to be an experienced rower [to] teach rowing,” athletic director Debbie De- Jong said. During fall 2018, LIU Post will introduce both women’s and men’s teams for rowing.
“Being a part of not just the rowing team but any other sports team gives you a sense of team, a coach, and a mentor,” DeJong said.
DeJong has a passion for rowing, and wanted to bring it to LIU Post.
“I have been in [an] institution of tremendous rowing at Rutgers and I was in a Division II institution that had rowing; I think they are great athletes who work hard,” she said. “I think anytime we can open up an opportunity at our campus to compete outside of the classroom is a benefit to the institution.”
The process of creating the teams did not take very long, DeJong said. In any sport, she said, “I think we look at opportunities that are in the area. We look at what is offered regionally from grassroots to high school and think about [whether] students [would] be interested in them, [if] it is a growing sport we could have, and who we would compete against in the region.”
DeJong hopes to have an NCAA women’s varsity rowing team in the future.
“Rosters usually go large for a rowing team,” DeJong said, but it “all depends on how many boats of eight compete and how many boats of four compete, and it would also depend on how many players we get.”
St. John the Baptist and St. Anthony’s are two area high schools that offer rowing teams. DeJong said that they will be starting their recruiting process this fall and as they need more players, they will also start looking nationwide.
Rick Hamilton, associate director of recreational sports, said LIU Post has had a crew team for many years.
“The club rowing team has been in our department for a number of years. From about 2002-2011 the team was fairly competitive. Since then the numbers have fallen off a little bit but we always hope to bring them back,” Hamilton said. “Getting student athletes [is] always the most important thing. Finding committed students that will represent the school well and sell the program to others is what [coaches] look for while making a team,” he added.
“I would be happy to start with four boats right away,” DeJong said. The rowing team will most likely be competing and practicing off the river and body of Oyster Bay. There will also be drylands for practice where the team can practice with “erg,” an indoor rowing machine that can be used on land, as well as run and lift weights. “
The process of bringing rowing to LIU Post has not been difficult, stated DeJong.
“There were not many obstacles. We have the support from our administration to start rowing. I think trying to find the perfect coaches is going to be a big piece of it and getting the word out that we are open- ing up an opportunity for both the men’s and women’s side, and doing something competitive is going to be the biggest obstacle or goal going forward.”
DeJong also said rowing is known to be a very expensive sport. The school currently has four rowing shells and ergs.
“We will start with that [equipment], and if we grow, then we need to go to administration and say we need three more boats. It will be a great thing if we need three or four more boats.”
As for the team’s future success, DeJong said her goal is “always succeeding academically,” not just for rowing, but for all student-athletes.
“I think graduating in four years and getting a degree from LIU is also a big piece of winning,” DeJong said, “but I think on the water it would be to row a successful program and compete on a national level.” Students interested in signing up for rowing can contact DeJong at debbie.dejong@liu.edu.

Last season, LIU Post’s football team held a winning record of 8-2. The record is good for most teams, but this season, the Pioneers want to be more than just good.
Head coach and defensive coordinator, Bryan Collins is expecting a tall order to be fulfilled in the 2018 season.
“An .800 winning percentage is a good season to most [other college football teams], but our goals here are to win the conference championship and get into the national championship game,” Collins said.
Master’s student and wide receiver, Deon Mash was also not satisfied with last year’s results.
“Last season seemed to be a good season to the fans, but it was quite disappointing to everyone on the team,” Mash said. “While we are happy to win as many games as we did, the goal was to make a run in the NCAA playoffs.”
Even though the season just began on Saturday, Collins already knows that we will see more seniors on the field this year than last.
“We have a nice mix of incoming players – we have 47 freshmen and a good number of walk-on players,” Collins said. “As I look at this senior class, I think almost all of them are starters for us, which is unusual, but we’re glad that the seniors have stuck around for all of these years.”
If the Pioneers want to win it all this year, that means there are some things that need to be worked on in regards to their gameplay, but Collins looks for his team to be mindful of everything, even off the field.
“In order to be a successful football team, it’s all about accountability and I think nowadays it’s hard to have that sense of accountability for others, whether it’s in the dorms at 11 p.m. where the coaches aren’t present, or in the weight room,” Collins said.
The Pioneer’s celebrated their first win of the season Saturday, Sept. 8, winning 33-8 vs. American International. Their next home game will be on Saturday, Sept. 22 at 1 p.m. at Bethpage Credit Union Stadium.
