The event, held in Pell Hall room 105 from 12 p.m.- 3 p.m, included a hands on demonstration with lenses, a short presentation about the lenses and free giveaways. The presentation was open to all majors.
Allison Rufrano, an adjunct professor of photography, organized the Tamron event with a colleague and alumni. She had suggested adding the university to Tamron’s Mobile Educational Tour. “It [Tamron] is a great job resource for photographers interested in sales,” Rufrano said.
Caroline Bert, a senior photography major and president of the photography club, has attended many events. This one, she said, was different from others. “Tamron will be providing the students with information about the new technology their brand has to offer,” Bert said before the event.
Bert found the event to be beneficial to her career as a photographer. “Whenever there is an opportunity and someone is able to bring more information to us, it is our responsibility to come ready to listen and grow,” Bert said.
Rufrano encourages students to attend the events regardless of their majors. “Photography is a universal medium,” she said. Anyone interested in optics gained “great insight at the event,” she added.
The photography program in the art department holds several events each year. A new photography club on campus will also be planning more events with an open invitation to all students.
At the invitation of the art department’s photography program, Tamron, a Japanese optics manufacturer, held a presentation about the latest photography technology on Monday, Nov. 6.

The room was packed; students and faculty filled room 109 of Humanities Hall during common hour on Oct. 26 as they waited for Dimitra Kessenides, special projects and news editor of Bloomberg BusinessWeek. This was the journalism program’s second lunchtime lecture of the semester, co-hosted by the political science department.
Kessenides was undecided throughout her college career about what she wanted to do with her life, like many of the students in the audience. She explained that once she realized she wanted to meet people, learn about their lives and work on stories more directly, she recognized she wanted to pursue a career in journalism.
After college, she went to graduate school in journalism, landed her first internship and then her first job at American Lawyer magazine. She said that she owes a lot of her success to this job, which she described as one of the best experiences in her professional career. “A lot of stuff can seem tedious when starting out at an entry level position; inevitably you are the person who is going to have to support senior reporters or editors by doing more research, doing fact checking, having to go and find things, and you might not have your name attached to the end product in those first couple of years,” Kessenides said.
She reminded the students of various majors in the audience that even though some jobs might not be everything they hoped for, they should take the job anyway. It could be the one experience that gets them to exactly where they want to be.
Aside from speaking about her career, Kessenides spoke to the audience about ways to be successful in the field of journalism. These tips were very useful to the students in the audience; they all gave Kessenides their full attention. “Every point of your career and who you meet is especially important,” she said. Kessenides explained that networking and experience is critical. “Broad experiences are good for exposure,” Kessenides said. In her career, without her first job experience, she may not have been able to do some of the things that she can do now. For example, because of her job at American Lawyer, she is now able to cover stories about the law without having gone to law school. That experience from her first job opened doors for her.
Kessenides also stressed the importance of internships. “Go out there and start working,” she said. No matter what kind of internship it is, it can help. They help with making connections and getting noticed, which are the building blocks to a career. The audience left the room with their questions answered and many tools they can use as they set foot in their professional careers.
The journalism program’s last lunchtime lecture of the semester will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 14 at 12:30 p.m. in Humanities, Room 109. Bruce Bergman, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, will explain the recent BLS projections that from 2016 to 2026, 11.5 million jobs will be added to stimulate the economy. He will tell students how to access the latest BLS information on job trends and career resources. The lunchtime lectures are open to students of all majors, free of charge.

A ribbon cutting ceremony for the new campus garden located in front of the Public Safety building was held on on Tuesday, Nov. 7 at 12:30 p.m., postponed from Tuesday, Oct. 31.
The garden, which was created by the Center for Sustainability, is a collaboration between Dr.Vic Divenere, professor of earth sciences, and the Coalition for Conservation club, which promotes conservation and sustainability. The garden will act not only as a service learning project for student volunteers, but will also provide fresh grown fruits and vegetables that promote sustainable and healthy food options.
The ribbon cutting ceremony featured six speakers and refreshments prepared by the campus nutrition club; these refreshments featured ingredients being grown in the garden. Attendees had an opportunity to try some of the food grown at the garden. The first speaker was Erica Ferrara, a junior geology major and president of the Coalition for Conservation club. Ferrara welcomed all guests and introduced them to the campus garden.
Divenere spoke second. “Do you know where your food comes from? Most of us don’t know where it comes from or where it’s produced.” He went on to explain, “what we are doing is to address where our food comes from and to have healthy food to make healthy people.” Divenere expressed the plans to expand the garden next semester and his hopes to tie the garden in with academics. “Ideally we want this to grow into a significant part of our program of environmental sustainability,” he said.
Jennifer Rogers-Brown, a professor in the sociology department, spoke next. Rodgers-Brown spoke to the sociological aspects to the garden and food justice.
Justin Poly, the campus chef from Aramark, was the fourth speaker. Poly praised the students who have developed the garden and spoke to the community aspects of growing food. “The idea of farming isn’t about the cultivation of food, it’s about perfecting and cultivating the human spirit,” Poly said.
Speaking after Poly was Bhavani Jaroff, a local natural foods chef and food activist. “I’m happy to see this garden here and I really do hope to see it grow,” Jaroff said. Jaroff runs a local chapter of Slow Food USA, an organization that promotes local food and traditional cooking; Jaroff also owns iEatGreen, an organization that provides resources to promote sustainability. Jaroff also spoke about food, farming and its interconnectivity to our health.
Last to speak was Scott Carlin, an earth science professor and director of the Center for Sustainability. Carlin spoke about the importance of sustainability and the campus garden. “All of our speakers have talked about our relationship to the ground,” Carlin said. “Sustainability is about health. Healthy people, healthy planet.”
The plot of land the garden sits on has been provided by the Facilities department along with electricity and water for the garden. Facilities also built a shed for the storage of farming tools. Funds for the garden’s seeds and tools are being provided through the Coalition for Conservation’s budget. “We have been growing a variety of different salad greens, carrots, beets, and radishes. All things that don’t necessarily need to be cooked so we can give them to students,” Ferrara said. “All the veggies are going to be growing into winter as well so we will be having a continual harvest.”
The club members devised a five year plan for the garden and hope to expand it enough to support a mobile market they can bring to needy Long Island communities. Club members hope to see their produce eventually used in campus eateries as part of a larger collaboration with campus food provider, Aramark.
Aramark would be open to having food grown on the campus garden served in the Winnick Student Center, according to Poly. He specified that it could be used in a theme night and remarked that other campuses that have Aramark food service have served food from their respective campus gardens before.
Students work on the farm every Friday. Any students who are interested in volunteering on the farm, can email: Post-coc@my.liu.edu for more information.

Happy November, here’s to another Happy Halloween come and gone. Hopefully some of you checked out ‘Blood Manor” at the Nassau Coliseum, but if not, it’s likely that you went to a party or had a celebration of some sort. No matter the case, you all were probably exposed to candy, and rightly so! A once a year candy spree is fine, right? Well, yes and no. Some of you may be shocked to find out some terrifying truths about Halloween and candy eating.
According to a seven year long study done by the University of Colorado and quoted in 2016 by Seth Gregory at FOX 31 news, Denver, the Halloween season has lasting effects on the waistline. Whether it’s candy from going trick or treating yourself, candy from a party, or any leftovers from Halloween night, the average child, ages 8-12, gains around 2.2 pound from Halloween candy each season. Considering that one pound is 3500 calories, this means that a whopping 7700 extra calories are being consumed and leading to weight gain most often in the belly area.
What happens to the metabolism of adults over time? That’s right, it slows down. So who knows how much weight that would mean for us? Just to give an idea, a fun size MilkyWay bar is 77 calories. While none of us are going to go and eat 45.5 MilkyWay minis in one day, if we take to indulging in five MilkyWay mini’s per day after Halloween, it will take just NINE days to gain one pound. That can escalate very quickly, especially considering that Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s are right around the corner, and who’s really going to turn down a piece of Grandma’s apple pie or seconds on Thanksgiving Day?
Now that certainly does not mean that we should deprive ourselves of any Halloween treats; that would just be cruel. 2014 studies done by the Institute for the Psychology of Eating show that depriving ourselves of indulgences here and there actually encourages binge eating behaviors and increases depression and irritability.
So instead, try to adopt some of these tips for beating away the real scary part of Halloween.
– Don’t keep candy in plain sight. Try throwing a piece in your school bag, console of your car, on your night stand or in a closed jar. This will stop you from mindlessly throwing a piece in your mouth every time you walk past. Open bowls can be a danger zone!
– Keep a regular eating pattern. Eat proper meals with carbs, ber, protein and fat before going for a piece of candy. That way you won’t over eat because you’re hungry; it will be a well deserved after dinner treat.
– Ditch the candy that you don’t LOVE. Having a lot of different types of candy around tricks you into thinking you can have another piece because there’s so much there! Only keep your absolute favorites.
– Actually look at the candy wrapper and its nutrition panel (if it has one). Keep in mind that we often consider low fat candies to be better for us, but what companies that boast about low fat candies don’t tell you is that the liver converts some sugar into fat! Choose candy that has lower sugar, trans and saturated fat content. These are less likely to cause spikes in blood sugar and rapid weight gain.
Finally, think about the fact that the satisfaction factor that candy elicits on the brain (an increase in dopamine, the body’s pleasure inducing neurotransmitter) lasts for a total of three minutes. If you don’t absolutely love the taste of a candy, put it down!

With the fluctuations in temperature these past few weeks, students are finding it difficult to know what to wear.
“On Monday I was wearing a t-shirt dress and then on Wednesday I had to put on a pair of UGG’s and a sweater,” Lilian Esedebe, a sophomore criminal justice major said.
“I was so conflicted on what to wear to class the other day, I looked at my weather app and it said 41 degrees but by 3 p.m. it would rise to about 67 degrees. Picking an outfit was hard because I knew for the first half of my day I would be cold. I ended up settling on a pair of sneakers, jeans, and a sweater,” Renee Adams, a senior photography major said.
On campus fashion has varied from students wearing long cardigan sweaters to some wearing leather jackets. “Every fall I have to get a new leather jacket, the color may not be different from the last but I have to get a new one. I believe the best item to own in the fall is a leather jacket,” Jarrett McKnight, a freshman undecided major said.
“I wasn’t always a fan of bomber jackets but for some reason this fall I’ve fallen in love with the trend. They go really well with my outfits and they’re extremely warm and comfy for the fall weather,” Coivan Makia, a junior international business major said.
Some students are even trading in their sneakers and slippers for rainboots, or knee high boots. With the way the weather has been the past couple of weeks, boots for all occasions are a necessity. “My girlfriend forced me to buy a pair of hunter boots for myself this fall because she said she was tired of seeing me wear sneakers out in the rain. I don’t think it was my worst investment, but for 140 dollars I think I would’ve found a better pair of rainboots for a cheaper price,” Martin Armstrong, a junior biology major said.
Overall with the weather changing pretty fast, winter clothing is something that should be on your radar when you go shopping the next time, long coats, heavy jackets, sweaters and boots!

Vulnerability tends to prevent a lot of us from pursuing something we want. We prefer to not have others look at us as helpless or not capable of achieving something on our own. Whether it is asking for a promotion at work, trying out for a team or simply raising your hand in class when you don’t understand something. What can you do to overcome this obstacle that is holding you back?
The first thing to realize is that most people feel the same way you do. Putting yourself out there for others to critique and judge can be a difficult thing to wrap your head around. You need to remind yourself that you are not alone. Although you might not be happy with it when people critique you or your work, it is often constructive and well-meant and really helps in the long run.
Being able to handle the judgment of others can only make you stronger. People are always going to have something to say about what you are doing, but being able to handle it will allow you to put yourself out there more. By going out and actually asking for the help you need overcome the negativity. Stay true to what you are pursuing, no matter who says what.
Many famous people have failed before they became anything. They used their failure as a platform to improve their work and continue toward their goal. Dr. Seuss was rejected 27 times by different publishers before he got his first book published. Movie director, Steven Spielberg was rejected twice from University of Southern California film school. Also the Beatles were told they would never have a shot because guitar bands were no longer a thing; soon enough they signed with a record label and became one of the more beloved bands in history. These people were told no and turned that into a yes by never quitting and improving themselves.
People will tell you no, but you need to find the courage to persevere and change that no into a yes. Continue on the path toward what you want because the more you fail the more grateful you will be once you succeed.

Professor Andy Wallace, a professional in the game design field, has been teaching students at LIU Post coding, game design, and computing for three years, since the undergraduate program was introduced. Wallace wears two hats; he is a mentor to students going into the field and also a game designer himself. With a background in computer science and design technology, Wallace designs small indie games for PC, Mac, IOS, and for old-school arcade cabinets. He prefers designing smaller games to designing for large game companies. One of his indie games was actually shown in the Smithsonian, he said.
Wallace explains coding as “a collection of ones and zeros” that creates something when processed in a machine. “These machines can be asked to do machine tasks,” Wallace said, reiterating the fact that his work is digital and completely based on computers. Wallace has created multiple games, such as “Extreme Exorcism” and “Particle Mace,” as experimental, indie projects which can now be bought and played by anyone interested.
Despite Wallace’s background in computer engineering, he makes his work extremely easy to understand. “Any piece of data can be treated as another piece of data,” he said. Wallace’s work shows just how versatile game design can be. His current project, “Bleep Space,” generates new cards for the game “Magic the Gathering” by computing and creating images and quotes completely virtually. This game will be shown and players can use these new cards at an event in New York City as soon as he finishes the design.
In the classroom, Wallace prides himself on “graduating students who can find a place in the industry.” He wants the students from his program to both use their skills to have fun and also to be useful in the business world. Wallace said he knows many students will not go into smaller game design like him, but instead want to work for larger game companies, and so he hopes to prepare his students for any path in gaming. Wallace said the difference between the two is that in his design, he works on all aspects of a project. At a larger company, the tasks are split up and the games a more collaborative effort. Wallace said the best part of teaching in the game design program is “playing games by students. People make really enjoyable work.”
In his classes, students design many games themselves, and Wallace says this can bring joy to the grading process. His students have created projects that are actually playable and fun to use.
Nicholas Frank, a freshman in Wallace’s game design course, says his teacher’s instruction has helped him grow as a game designer. A game designer and coder before entering college, Frank said that “[Wallace] understands people in his class and he’s very qualified. I took Java in high school, and what Wallace teaches in one class is what it took us months to learn in the past.” Wallace’s teaching stems directly from his work in the field. “He plays games and he makes games,” Frank said, “and he starts off with a very good curriculum.” Despite being a freshman, Frank says taking Wallace’s class has already incredibly improved his game design skills.
Wallace’s work in game design can be seen at andymakes.com.

Graduate art therapy students are presenting original work in an exhibition titled “We Can’t Find the Words” opening Nov. 16 in the sculpture building.
The reception will last from 6 to 8 p.m. and will showcase the work of 25 artists. Since many of them aspire to become licensed art therapists, they must first learn to access their own emotionally difficult experiences and work towards healing themselves through their own art. “Every art-making experience is personal for artists and all artists have worn a thorn or two in their side,” adjunct graduate professor of fine arts, Anncharlotte Tavolacci, said. “This course examines how we can investigate those thorns to come up recreated.”
Elizabeth Jordan, second year graduate student, will feature a mixed-media piece inspired by a trip she took to India and Africa. The piece is comprised of pencil drawing and a photography collage that depicts people next to a “big sci-fi-fi type rhino from Jurassic Park,” Jordan said. The people appear to be completely unphased by its presence. “My topic is mid-life transition, as opposed to mid-life crisis,” she said. The theme focuses on life when people are between the ages of forty and sixty. “As we start to age, our bodies start to get older, understanding about mortality begins to come into play,” Jordan said. She believes this is a time to redefine oneself and adjust to abrupt changes, and she wishes to help people better maneuver through it effectively.
Jordan completed her master’s last year and is currently taking a break from the commercial art world to immerse herself in the art therapy degree program. “I was really wondering what to do next, and just by chance a friend of mine had a stroke,” she said, “This is one of those things that we have to deal with.” She started working with him in making clay-based art and started thinking about those with neurological ailments will live the rest of their lives.
Jaime Terracciano, second year graduate student, is showing work inspired by her fear of sharks. In it, she illustrated herself with a shark’s dorsal fin wearing a red bathing suit. “I did the waves to symbolize being swamped by my fears of sharks,” she said. Originally, Terracciano intended for the red suit to represent blood, but after conferring with classmates, it’s resemblance to a life guard’s uniform has come to stand for safety. “I probably just want to feel safe in the water, instead of afraid. “[My experience] has been really nerve-wracking,” Terracciano said, describing preparing for her first show, “I made so many drawings that I didn’t know which one to choose. But in the end it was a good opportunity to become really creative.”
Kemika Jindawong, first year graduate student from Thailand, drew her inspiration from how she portrays her own emotions. One piece she will be displaying is a clay mask. “I want to find my happiness, and how to turn from sadness to happiness,” she said. “I want to make a really happy face, and when I worked with my mask, the result looked really sad.” This taught Jindawong that she cannot hide her sadness and has to accept it as part of herself; the theme of her work is titled “Self-Acceptance.” Jidawong’s other piece will be a watercolor painting.
Previously, Jindawong has done a show in Thailand about sensory perception. She drew portraits of 100 different women to make up the exhibition. Her pursuit of art therapy is greatly fueled by the students she teaches at her studio in Thailand. Some of the students have ADHD, emotional stress, or aggressive tendencies, so working on art helps with their concentration. “I want to help them with my art.”
Jay Barba suffered a head injury in 1989, hospitalizing him for three months, so his art is inspired by his recovery. “I couldn’t recognize my mother, I didn’t know the alphabet, I forgot everything,” he said, “It most seriously damaged the part of my brain that controls verbal function, so I couldn’t speak clearly.” Once he realized he wasn’t having a nightmare, he had to push himself to get everything back. Barba still considers himself to have had a “happy ending” since he was able to recover more successfully than his fellow patients, “I was only seventeen, so I was still producing new brain cells,” he said, “I was one of [the hospital staff’s] favorite success stories.”
“I feel like I’m finally focused; It’s refreshing and exciting,” Barba said, commenting on his experience in class. He describes his art as introspective; his piece “My Thoughts” will be displayed during the exhibition. “It shows how lost I was and how I felt I was facing insurmountable challenges,” he said. He wants his work to push people to succeed.
A wide variety of projects will be featured, each inspired by a different person’s life and made of multiple different media. “All of them are intended to evoke a sense of catharsis,” Jordan said. The works are a way for the artists to seek pleasure, relaxation and a deeper understanding of themselves. This is in preparation to work as therapists who will have to help clients uncover things in their subconscious. “This is a tough class because we really have to be ready to come head- to-head with topics that we haven’t explored in- depth before,” Jordan said.
“Everybody has their own fears but we can overcome it, and art is a great way to express those things,” Terracciano said.

Sharon Papp’s “Inspirited Introspection” art exhibit was featured in the S.A.L gallery from Oct 31-Nov. 1. It was partially comprised of recyclables with vibrant colors, feminine motifs, and spiritual images. Though she does not follow any specific religion, Papp draws her inspiration from spirituality, and believes that art helps her find her true and higher self.
One of her pieces is based on her work as a teacher at Mill Neck Manor, a school for deaf children. She combines her knowledge of sign language with her spirit animal, the raven. In the piece, a young girl does the sign for “patience” and the raven is drawn towards her. Legs in the center of the work walk towards “wholeness and healing.”
Papp’s work comes entirely from her spiritual journey, and she said this begins with feminine energy. “The feminine, the flower, the root are all incredibly important in my works,” she said. In one piece, a woman resembling Papp meditates while cross-legged on the floor, and a raised shell-like material sits in the lower center of her torso, representing feminine root energy driving her forward.
When asked about how feminine energy translates into today’s society, Papp stressed that more must be done to create a more equal world. “There’s still a struggle to find equality. There are small steps that help us to rise up, but there needs to be more done,” she said
In addition to celebrating femininity, Papp’s work focuses on finding her own spiritually. “Part of your spirituality is accepting who you are and sharing your experiences with others so they are able to accept themselves,” she said.
More information about her art is available by emailing thegypsiesattic@gmail. com.

There’s been an awakening in the Post Theatre Company as theatre students prepare to perform Frank Wedekind’s “Spring Awakening,” premiering on Nov. 10 in the Little Theatre. Stephen Davis, the director, is a professor at Saint Lawrence College in Bronxville, NY. The cast consists of 24 sophomores, juniors and seniors.
Although the adapted version of “Spring Awakening” put to music by Duncan Sheik is more of a rock concert; the LIU Post version is quite different. “The original production was a mashup of a Broadway show and a rock concert; this will be a more expressionistic, whimsical acoustic version of the show. It is ours,” Davis said. “The elements the show explores will be greatly devised by the cast, making most of the work completely original. This entire process has been a team effort. Every voice is heard, and every idea is explored. It’s a very exciting way to create a piece.”
‘Spring Awakening’ is a story of relationships, between adults or parents, and children, and how society affects the growth of youth,” Ervin Gonzalez, senior musical theatre major, said. The musical explores the concepts of sexual awakening, rebellion and self-discovery as teenagers come of age in a repressive society.
On a recent day, the cast rehearsed a piece from the original soundtrack in the Theater, Film, Dance and Arts Management building. The round shape of the stage was outlined by tape on the floor so the actors could adjust to the performance area. The students showed great chemistry with each other, the scene being rehearsed showed themes of sexuality and authority and the students were not afraid to emphasize each moment.
“We all get along very well,” Christina Kroell, senior musical theatre and film major, said. “The production team created a very open and honest space for us to work in.”
“Spring Awakening” will run Nov. 10-12 and 16-19 in the Little Theatre Mainstage. Showtime is 7:30 p.m. with 3 p.m. Sunday matinees.

On Nov. 10 at 7:30 p.m. Long Island band Blue Oyster Cult, also known as B.Ö.C, will perform at the Tilles Center. Prepare for a night of hard rock music. The band Jefferson Starship will open the show with a performance in the atrium.
Blue Oyster Cult will be performing some of their classic songs. With music spanning over three decades, they are a hard rock blues band that began their journey in Long Island in the late 60s’. After a few breakups and setbacks, the group practiced and had the occasional jam session at an old house near Stony Brook College, according to Mike Themistocleous, assistant manager at Tilles.
As time went on, the sessions became band practices, and a new group was formed in ’67 with members John Wiesenthal, Donald Roeser, Albert Bouchard, Allen Lanier, and Andrew Winters. “I think it would be a good show to bring my dad to since he’s a big 80s’ rock fan,” freshman theater management major and Tilles employee, Kelly Coar, said.
The band Jefferson Starship stems from the hard rock group Jefferson Airplane. Some of the songs that they have performed are “Find Your Way Back” and “Jane”. “I expect there to be a tremendous turnout, because B.O.C are Long Island natives and a popular band,” Armando Zazueta, guest services manager, said.
Blue Oyster Cult’s most famous songs include “Godzilla”, “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper” and “Burnin’ for You”. They have sold over 24 million records worldwide and 7 million records within the United States. “As a music fanatic, hard rock may not be one of his favorite genres, but I can acknowledge that B.O.C has made some good songs over their career,” Paris Dickinson, junior theater major and Tilles employee, said.

From themed tee shirts to Halloween costumes, the 2016 Netflix series “Stranger Things” has influenced the pop culture world. The series takes place in the 1980s and follows a group of boys who lose their friend, Will Byers (Noah Schnapp), due to supernatural forces. They try to save him from a separate world referred to as “the underground.” Season two was released on Oct. 27 on Netflix and is nine episodes filled with thrill and suspense. Characters uncover secret government experiments and various other unsettling realizations in this thriller.
Paul Evans, senior broadcasting major, spent his day off due to the power outage on Monday, Oct. 3o, binge-watching both seasons of the show. “I see [“Stranger Things”] becoming as popular as “The Twilight Zone” series; they both have a large following of many age groups,” Evans said, referencing the 1959-1964 tv program. “It’s a good way to distract yourself from all the depressing events happening in society currently,” he said, “You get invested in the plot.”
Kristen Guadagna, a senior art therapy major, balances school, work and a social life but still finds streaming the series convenient for her schedule. Guadagna watched the second season of “Stranger Things” in two days. “It’s a rather short series, so students would have time to watch an episode or two between schoolwork,” she said.
Nicole Wojnicki, senior broadcasting major, watched season two in three days due to her busy schedule. She finds the series to be unique. “They always end the episode on a cliffhanger. The story draws people in,” Wojnicki said.
Aida Enamorado, senior international studies major, believes the reason for the series’ success is the decade it takes place in. “[The creators] really pay attention to detail–the clothes, the music, the games, everything,” she said. “It’s something different than other shows available.” Enamorado loves the mystery and unpredictability of “Stranger Things” and encourages other students to watch the new season. “The soundtrack is amazing, there is a strong female lead character, references to movies and shows we all know and love are there, and there’s something for everyone,” she said.
Season one, consisting of eight episodes, and season two are available to stream on Netflix.

It’s been three years since British singer Sam Smith released his debut album, “In the Lonely Hour.” In 2014, Smith’s album debuted and was able to garner success not only in the UK, but also in the U.S. It earned Smith six Grammy nominations that year, and he won four of the awards including Best New Artist and Record of the Year.

A year later in December of 2015, Smith released a remixed version of “In The Lonely Hour”, featuring John Legend, Mary J. Blige, ASAP Rocky and more. After all of his success worldwide, it seemed as if Smith disappeared and was nowhere to be found for three years. “I was scared he wasn’t going to release anymore music,” Ashley Dugue, a sophomore biology major said. “Some artists only release one album and they’re satisfied. If that’s what he was planning, I still would have been happy for him but I’m a really greedy fan; I need new music,” Dugue said.
Predictably, fans were overjoyed and sent social media into a frenzy, when Smith sent out a tweet simply stating “4 days,” on Sept. 4. Fans didn’t know what to expect with this new single because of Smith’s absence both on social media and in the public eye. “Sam Smith has a special place in my heart because he has helped me heal from one of the worst relationships I’ve ever been in,” Melanie Oswego, senior business administration major, said. “I’m a bit scared because he just left and never said what he was going to do, and here he is with new music. Don’t get me wrong, I’m extremely excited, but I hope he doesn’t disappoint,” she said.
The single, “Too Good At Goodbyes” was released on Sept. 8, and with it, Smith reminded his fans why they fell in love with him in the first place. The song was definitely inspired by his hit song “Stay With Me,” but not too much that would make you second guess whether he was able to make new music with a different sound. The song is based on a recent breakup; Smith is coming to the realization that he is getting better at letting go without being as hurt as in previous times.
The next single released was “Pray” on Oct. 5. Timbaland and Jimmy Napes co-produced the song for Smith. The song has gospel and hip hop influences. Smith used this song to express his deep concern for the world we live in. The album was fully released on Nov. 3 on streaming platforms and retail stores, including Target, Best Buy, and Walmart. The album sounds like a couple of chapters ripped out of Smith’s diary. Smith speaks on coming out, accepting himself, failed relationships, God, and how he plans to move on from where he is now. The standard album has 10 songs, while the special edition has 14 songs. “No Peace” is the only song on the album that features another artist, YEBBA. The song describes all the things they would do for their partner to ensure that they are safe and happy or they won’t be at peace with themselves. The title track can be found on the special edition. Smith explains why all the negatives in his life have become the thrills of his life.
Overall, the album definitely showcases a more vulnerable and relatable Smith, but does not scare the listeners away with content that may be too harsh to the ear.
The album is available on streaming platforms and at major music retailers. Smith has also announced that his world tour will kick off next year in Sheffield, England on March 20 and end in Calgary, Canada on Sept. 13.

The women’s soccer team advanced to the ECC championship final against Mercy College by defeating Bridgeport, 1-0, on Wednesday, Nov. 1 in a home game at the Pioneer soccer park. The win improved the team’s overall record to 15-2-1. Junior Andrea Huntzinger scored the lone goal in the victory. Junior goalie Hillevi Eklow made two saves, recording her 10th shutout of the season. The Pioneers out shot Bridgeport 20-5 throughout the game.
Huntzinger, who led the Pioneers to the win, said that determination to move on to the ECC Championship Final was riding with the team the entire way. “We were determined to do whatever we had to do to win and get to play another game on Saturday,” she said. “That meant playing our game to the best ability we could.”
LIU Post’s ECC championship final took place on Saturday, Nov. 5 at 1 p.m. also at home. The team lost, 3-0, against Mercy College. Now with a 15-3-1 record for the season, the members of the team await their future in the NCAA selection show to see their seeding in the NCAA Division II Championship.
The Pioneers struggled to find the back of the net all during the final game, going 0-for-3 on shots on goal and 0-for-9 on total shots. Mercy College struck first, with a 19 minute goal, along with back-to-back goals in the 37th-minute. It was smooth sailing the rest of the way from the Mercy Mavericks.
Though they fell to Mercy College, the Pioneers have gone 6-2 over their last eight games, dating back to their 4-0 victory over Queens College on Oct. 11. The team is still considered to be dangerous heading into the NCAA Division II Championship.
The selection will air on Monday, Nov. 6 at 6 p.m. on NCAA.com.
