Cameron Clay is a junior Musical Theatre major. Although he was a competitive swimmer growing up, he left the water for the stage in high school. The summer after high school graduation, he began his cirque arts training in the SkyGym Atlanta studio. In Fall 2012, Cameron moved to New York from Atlanta to attend LIU Post. After his freshman year, however, he left the university to pursue his passion for cirque arts, working a variety of jobs in order to train with Aerial Arts NYC. In September 2014, he returned to LIU Post to finish his bachelor’s degree.
What made you start acrobatics?
I saw the Cirque du Soleil show Mystère in Las Vegas and was completely blown away. While I was watching, I kept thinking, “I could do that. I’m going to learn how to do that.” When I got home from the trip, I found a training studio on the other side of Atlanta from me. After the introductory class, I was hooked.
What is a normal day of training like?
I’m lucky enough to learn from some trainers who have either been part of a Cirque du Soleil cast or have worked closely with the company. My main focus is aerial silks and static trapeze. When I was able to train regularly, I would alternate classes throughout the week starting with an hour of stretch and flexibility, followed by an hour or two of another class: silks, trapeze, or conditioning. Other aspects of training include being aware of what you eat throughout the day and listening to anything your body is telling you.
Which was your favorite Cirque show to be in?
I haven’t been in a full cirque-only show yet. I performed at the Tilles Center Collage Concert in Spring 2013 and was able to use my silks in Post Theatre Company’s Big Love last semester. Silks are basically the two fabrics that you have to climb up and do combinations with. There are two types: the hammock and the regular silk apparatus. The hammock is just one silk and it is easier because it is more stable. There are no cables or harnesses; you just have to hold on and tie foot knots to stay in, if need be.
Do you plan on doing freelance acrobatics on the side?
This skill is great because of its versatility. In recent years, there has been a surge of activity in the world of cirque arts. This means there are a lot more opportunities opening up for freelancing. I’m going to be pursuing this further after graduation.
What is your favorite ‘trick’?
I love drops on the silks and my favorite is probably a variation of the double star drop with a hip key launch. Basically, you start all wrapped up at the top of the silks, leaning parallel to the ground, before launching yourself backwards into a fast, exciting drop.
What are your plans for the future?
It’s hard to say exactly what will happen after graduation. I plan to audition as much as possible and will be training as I do so. Within the next few years, I plan to move to California and while I’m keeping my options open, I’m definitely keeping an eye on the Circus Center San Francisco cirque company.
How did you get involved with the Cirque?
I picked up on things quickly and discovered a passion for the art. When I started at LIU, I bought my own silks apparatus and brought it with me to keep up with it as much as possible. At the end of my first year at Post, I auditioned for the intensive program for Circus Warehouse in Queens and was given a spot, even though I was a novice compared to the other students. I planned to join the company soon after leaving school, but that was not meant to be and I’m very happy to have chosen the company I ended up with. I am currently with Aerial Arts NYC. I do stretch and flexibility classes, silk choreography classes, static trapeze, and some contortion classes. I am with this company mainly for training and seasonal showcases.
Who is your favorite acrobat, if you have one, and how has this person inspired you to become who you are today?
There are many acrobats I admire; one of my more recent favorites is Tom Ball. I draw inspiration from the storytelling in his work and the acting he incorporates into his performances.

While I was watching my British news show, the reporter said in a flustered voice, “England has had flurries of snow all night!” My Mum told me it stopped after around 12 hours. As she said this, I couldn’t help but scowl while looking out of the window at the snow I have walked through for the past two weeks. I said to them, “yeah, still very snowy here in New York!”
While many of you may think of me as an old, scrawny Michael Caine, who says “Bah! Humbug!” you are wrong. In fact, I love the snow. The snowball fights, the crisp crunch of newly laid snow; it’s great. And the first and second day of snow even made the ‘exotic’ town of Hicksville a sight for sore eyes. However, this freeze and constant flurry of snow is now at the stage of ice and ‘slusk’ (like many of our Scandinavian friends may say), which are beginning to make the long walk home and through campus a very stressful voyage.
I am not alone. Ian Jonson, a freshman Undecided major from Sweden, hasn’t stopped complaining ever since the melting of snow began.
“I hate when the snow melts, slusk just gets everywhere!” Jonson said. For the first time, I would probably agree with a Swede!
Being an international student from England, I am not used to the severity of the snow here in New York, or the briskness of the cold. It’s nuts! I guess the Swedes and the overwhelming number of Norwegians are all used to this (because they live in igloos and have coats made out of yetis, right?). But, overseas students from China, India, South America, and also England, are at a disadvantage. While they are still settling in with the move from home, and not having their friends and parents nearby, they are compelled to join forces with the winter freeze of New York. It can really make you feel homesick.
So, how do we deal with our first snowy and arctic weather experience here in N.Y.? Well, a pair of boots. These are essential: great in the snow to get through it safely, as well as having the grip to sustain the killer instinct of ice, preventing an embarrassing and frankly dangerous fall; obviously a bear- like coat, which keeps the warmth in; a bobble hat is also very useful in this penetrating subzero weather. Another thing that has become an excellent addition to my ‘winter collection’ is a snood! All of the Scandinavians — which I claim are my friends but who probably can’t stand the sight of me — have these amazing cold repellent garments. I definitely recommend a snood**! And, of course, although Valentine’s Day has passed, you can always get a companion who likes to cuddle and use them as warmth!
**snood — noun
1. an ornamental hairnet or fabric bag worn over the hair at the back of a woman’s head.
2. a wide ring of knitted material worn as a hood or scarf

For students who’ve been attending LIU Post for a while, the commute around campus can be an easy one, once you get used to it. However, what about the students who are adjusting to their new ground?
With winter break over, a new spring semester is upon us, and this year’s freshman class is just starting to learn its way around. Given the faulty circumstances of bad weather and delayed openings, how do the current freshmen feel about Post?
 
Radiology major Sarah Kang is truly having a great time at Post with all that the university has to offer. “The first half of my year was fun, especially since I was on the soccer team. It always made my day busy, and I’m looking forward to finishing this semester with a decent GPA,” Kang said.
The same goes for Business Management major Abraham Orenstein, who seconds Kang’s notion of positive vibes and good times. “I met all sorts of people and have awesome friends. I’m looking forward to hanging with my friends again, [but am] not looking forward to taking Spanish class, which I struggle with,” Orenstein said.
“My favorite thing to do at Post is to hang out with my friends in the rec room,” Orenstein added. “We play all sorts of card games, like ‘Magic, the Gathering’ and ‘Hearthstone.’ ”
Academically, Orenstein also favors the tutoring center, as it helps him do better in classes that he struggles with.
Kang, on the other hand, takes pride and fun in our Athletics Department and the teams that make it all happen, the Pioneers.
“My favorite things about Post are the sports games, and how exciting they can get,” she said, revealing that her most highlighted moment came with her fellow soccer team members when they qualified for the NCAA tournament.
Unlike Kang, Orenstein doesn’t necessarily have a single, highlighted moment, but he does have something important to say.
“My least favorite things about Post are mainly the hours of all the food places on campus,” Orenstein said. “I used to eat dinner late, but Winnick closes so early, especially on the weekends.”
As for me, personally, I remember freshman year like it was yesterday. From day one, I sensed a great community vibe, and everyone was really friendly and willing to help. I had great professors, great friends, and great experiences. For the entire new freshman this year, I have this to say: be sure to have fun, and enjoy every moment that you can. However, at the same time, don’t be afraid to ask for help, because there will always be someone there for you.
Are you a freshman for the 2015 academic semester, welcome to Post! If not, then welcome back! If you have any suggestions or comments for The Pioneer, your campus newspaper, please email us at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

“I feel that if there is a mandatory requirement [for all students], it shouldn’t be emailed to us since we get so many emails a day; it could get easily overlooked.”— Elizabeth Panzica, junior Art Therapy majorOn Feb. 2, 2015, the university issued a mass-email to all Post students, stating that every student, regardless of academic year or major, would have to take a newly-constructed, mandatory online course on sexual assault prevention.
The Haven online course is the result of a partnership between Long Island University and EverFi, “which helps students develop critical life skills such as alcohol abuse prevention, sexual assault prevention, and financial literacy across the country.”
The course was made easily accessible to students, through their ‘My LIU’ accounts, the same day it was announced via email. Due dates for both sections of the course (Feb. 24 and April 14), were posted in the notice, along with a ‘passing exam score,’ which is the minimum-grade that students would ultimately need to pass the online course.
John DiMartino, a senior Information Technology Management major, believes the course is unnecessary in the long run.
“This online course was poorly formulated,” DiMartino said. “[It] does nothing to teach anyone any information that they didn’t already know, or that they could have looked up in a textbook or online source.”
DiMartino also commented on the subject matter and content of the course, admitting that sexual assault is a topic that rightfully should be addressed. However, he said that holding an online course is not the way to do it.
“I don’t think a course is the way to go about addressing this issue,” DiMartino said. “[It] and would be better served in a lecture- based presentation that people can go to without being graded. More people would take it seriously in this manner, and would benefit more to learning the facts than taking an online course that isn’t well put together in the first place.”
Senior Digital Arts major Gerard Gilmartin agrees with DiMartino.
“This course they made seems just random, and out of the blue,” Gilmartin said. “Not only for me, but for other students, as well. Not many students are going to have much time, because a good amount of students have projects for their own individual classes and midterms are coming up.”
Like DiMartino, Gilmartin believes in other ways of spreading awareness of serious subjects on campus, suggesting that inviting a guest speaker during common hour, or simply handing out information via handouts are better methods.
I agree with DiMartino and Gilmartin. Upon receiving the email, I was very confused at first. However, after reading it thoroughly and analyzing it, I found it a little unnecessary, but more so, rather abrupt and impromptu. I believe it was an unfair decision to send out the email a little while before midterm exams, because it decreased the chances of a student to be able to properly prepare for it.
If you’re a student and have any questions about the online course, you can contact Jean Anne Smith, LIU Post’s associate dean of students, at her LIU email, jeananne.smith@liu.edu.

“I was driving stick in a green VW Beetle,” read one of the poems, during one of the Poetry Center’s frequent readings on Feb. 11. Susana H. Case and Anthony DiMatteo, professors respectively of Behavioral Sciences and English at NYIT, were the poets featured in the first reading of the semester. Their subjects were varied; from travel, to marriage, and rock- and-roll.
The event started with Case reading from several of her publications, the latest being “4 Rms W Vu,” mainly touching
the subject of human interactions and relationships. Her poem used a New York City apartment and its different rooms as metaphors; for instance, the storage room as a metaphor for memories. “Be my abode. My foundation wall. Mud block and concrete node-press,” read one of Case’s poems.
DiMatteo, a Pushcart Prize nominee and publisher of several chapbooks (collections of poems), started his session with a rap-inspired poem about cupid, inspired by the approach of Valentine’s Day. DiMatteo’s works have been featured in several publications, including College Literature, Avatar Poetry Review, and The Cortland Review. His latest book, published on Jan. 29, of last year, is called Beautiful Poems, and has received positive reviews from critics.
The Poetry Center, a part of the English Department, has several more poetry readings planned for the spring semester, which is listed at the bottom. Dr. Joan Digby, director of the Honors College and a professor of English, stated that the readings this spring will be full of nationalities and cultures from all around the world, including “A Celebration of Chinese New Year” on Feb. 19, where Leslie Bai, a fellow English professor and translator of Chinese classical poetry, will read and hold a workshop related to the celebration. In March there are two readings, which will feature poets from Japan, India, Trinidad, and Long Island.
The Poetry Center is also having a competition, in collaboration with the English Department. Students and alumni are encouraged to submit poetry and short fiction stories. There are several categories, including graduate student and alumni, with prizes in each of the categories. This is the 49th Annual Poetry and Fiction Contest. The deadline is Feb. 24. For rules and more info, contact Professor Digby at Joan.Digby@liu.edu. The winners will be announced on the 47th annual Poetry Awards Night, where there are readings and the winners are praised, on April 14.

On Feb. 24, rock band Led Zeppelin’s 1975 double-album, “Physical Graffiti,” will be the next recognized LP to get a supreme- package release, joining reissues of the band’s first five albums last year.
Like the previous reissues, this deluxe album will be available in a range of formats, from a simple re-mastered two-disc collection, to a super deluxe box on both CD and vinyl, containing a 96-page hardcopy book, download card, and art print. It’s understandable that former Zep groupies or those who practice monthly “Zepethons” would probably add this package to their rock shrine. Is it too late for the younger generations to start embracing “Zepplemania?”
In 1968, while The Beatles’ hit “Hey Jude” peaked on the Billboard Top 100, Zeppelin’s lead guitarist, Jimmy Page, held the band’s first rehearsal. After a couple of minutes, he realized the magic that started to brew beneath floorboards of a record store on London’s Gerald Street, where the band was practicing. The story goes that the band played just one number, “Train Kept a Rolling,” and immediately the creative energy was there. The raunchy guitar riffs bellowing out
of Page’s Gibson instantly complimented Robert Plant’s limitless vocal range, raising their talents to new heights where only giants could see. Drummer, John Bonham, and bassist-keyboardist, John Paul Jones, also rightfully played a critical part in the accomplishments of the band. For the band, they needed polarization to be in sync, and their diverse backgrounds miraculously brought them closer together.
Each of these musicians had an unusually rich and varied archive of influences to draw from. While many British rock bands seemed to focus on more traditional, one-dimensional visions, Zeppelin had a privy guitarist whose prowess feasted on anything from hard blues to Indian music. Zeppelin’s vocal front man from Birmingham, Robert Plant, tackled anything from soul to west coast psychedelic during his local pub gigs.
Later on, Plant would drop lyrical nods to J.R.R. Tolkein’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy in Zeppelin songs, some a bit more obvious than others. From the 1969 Led Zeppelin II album, the song, “Ramble On” clearly references the epic trilogy when Plant screams, “Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair, but Gollum and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her.” Even the best Zeppelin song of all-time, – despite what Rolling Stone claims – “Stairway to Heaven,” plays with “LOTR” words. 
Last year, when Page began to unearth the collection of Zeppelin albums, he knew that this music would never be cast off into musical Mordor, and still retains a viable omnipresence in the genre of rock-and-roll to this day. Now, with its 40th anniversary and reissue approaching, “Physical Graffiti” will remind audiences just how creatively risky the band really was. This album could even be regarded as the one “synopsis” album of the Zeppelin discography, featuring a palate of their signature music styles over the years.
One of “Graffiti’s” songs, “Ten Years Gone,” refers to the story about a pre-Zeppelin Plant making music, and a lover of his trying to pull him away from that. As Plant recalls, she bluntly says, “It’s me or the fans.” Fast-forward 50 years later, Plant is still performing live and headlining for major festivals, including at this year’s Bonaroo and Sasquatch, while Page continues to elevate the rhythmic pulse of Zeppelin and Paul Jones tours with Dave Grohl under the super group title, Them Crooked Vultures. When you look to the west, the late Johnny “Bonzo” Bonham could be seen driving the beat, and providing the backup vocals to Joe Crocker’s cover of “With A Little Help From My Friends.”
The reissued “Physical Graffiti” drops on Feb. 24.

While “50 Shades of Grey” was released in theaters on Feb. 13, just in time for Valentine’s Day, is watching it with your significant other the best gift in store? Poor acting and lack of chemistry, combined with sexual activity and promiscuity, led to much controversy upon the release of the film, based on the popular erotic romance novels by E. L.
James. At first glance, the film is complemented by nice cinematography and music – a definite eye catcher. Within the first few minutes, college student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is introduced to young, wealthy entrepreneur Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), having to interview him for her school newspaper. From the moment they meet, a lack of chemistry between the actors is evident, making future scenes awkward and uncomfortable for the viewer to watch.
In addition, the movie is filled with a series of clichés. For example, Ana is made out to look like the socially awkward ‘Plain Jane’. When she is summoned to Christian’s office, she falls flat on her face while opening the door, thus representing an awkward, innocent young woman, in contrast to the domineering, experienced Mr. Grey. Furthermore, the meeting scene was filled with poorly acted sexual references; for example, Ana asks Christian if he is gay while chewing on a pencil with his name on it and batting her eyelashes at him.
There is a failure in the story to develop a realistic intimacy between the characters. Within the first fifteen minutes of the movie, it was as if the two had known each other for a much longer time; Christian appears at the hardware store Ana works at to buy rope, masking tape, and cable ties. These are things she presumed he would use for house projects when in reality he uses them in his sexual playroom. In this scene, and many others, there is a lack of substantial conversation that would help develop the characters and the story.
Instead of meaningful interaction, the characters engage in sexual references and flirty small talk, all revolving around sex. For example, Ana tells Christian to use coveralls during his home projects. He responds that he would rather work sans clothes – another sexual reference most people who have just met would not say. Christian saves Ana from a bike nearly hitting her in the street, saying, “I am not the guy for you. You should steer clear of me.” Inevitably, the female protagonist can’t stay away, and she ends up crawling back to him and his lair of sexual preferences.
Eventually, Ana becomes so enthralled with him that she can’t leave, and yet she never signs the contract he has all “submissive” – women who agree to have sex with him – sign. The contract gives Christian consent to do whatever he wants to Ana sexually. When he brings her in his helicopter for the first time and straps her in, he says, “No escaping now.” This foreshadows the future scenes in the playroom, where he binds her for sexual activity. Ana is consistently tied up without her consent, demonstrating why this movie is seen as controversial.
Ana agrees to be his submissive without signing the contract, and tells Christian that she refuses to be whipped and put in pain. Despite her complaints, she is whipped. He teaches her to be an obedient sex slave, doing everything he demands from her. When she refuses to sign the contract, Christian shows up at her apartment, binds her to the bed, and consensually violates her. “50 Shades” thus implies that it is okay for women to be submissive to men and their desires.
This movie also gives people the wrong idea about sexual pleasure. Christian relates helping poor and impoverished hungry people to the hunger he experiences when he craves someone sexually – this is not the wisest correlation to make, nor one that promotes a truly healthy relationship. The screenwriters chose to demonstrate his lust for someone over true love, which further affirms the abusive elements of this film.
This movie also demonstrates emotional abuse. Christian is not very nice to Ana, especially with his consistent mood swings, and she becomes emotionally scarred after he guilts her for demonstrating emotions of love towards him. “50 Shades” doesn’t leave the viewer with a settled opinion about love. Rather, it exposes the viewer to sexual and emotional abuse, abuse that the screenwriters attempt to normalize.
Finally, the movie opens and closes with a rainstorm, symbolizing the cleansing of Ana’s soul. In the beginning, the cleansing is the foreshadowing of her losing her virginity, and by the end, the cleansing of her sins in her consent to sexual activity with Mr. Grey. There is good closure to the film, but with this closure comes a cliffhanger, one that most likely means there are more films to come, following the book trilogy.
Overall, the film did have some good qualities, such as the music, cinematography, few bursts of traditionally romantic scenes, and closure that is somewhat satisfying. However, the negatives outweigh the positives. The film lacked substantial conversation, character and story development, focusing mostly on sexual innuendoes. The lack of chemistry between the two actors made it even more unattractive to watch. “50 Shades of Grey” is fifty shades of not worth your time.

On Wednesday, Feb. 11, the men’s basketball team (12-11) decimated Mercy College Mavericks (7-14), 85-57, in an East Coast Conference tilt at the Pratt Recreation Center.
After starting the contest on an impressive 24-8 run, the Pioneers never looked back. The hosts shot the ball efficiently all night long, as they finished above 49 percent from the field and 40 percent from the three-point range. On the side of the ball, the Mavericks couldn’t put multiple possessions together and get going while the Green and Gold kept the pedal to the metal.
Sophomore forward Greg Dotson collected 18 points, seven rebounds, five blocks, and two steals while senior guard P.J. Torres knocked down 16 points in 19 minutes of action off the bench. Junior guard Dillon Burns racked up 11 points and dished out six assists, and junior guard Chris Orozco tallied nine points, five boards and a pair of steals in the victory, as well.
The Pioneers returned to the floor Saturday, Feb. 14, where they fell short to ECC rival St. Thomas Aquinas College Spartans (16-9) by a final score of 68-64 at Aquinas Hall.
Trailing 36-30 at intermission, the Pioneers came out on a 13-3 burst in the opening five minutes of the second half, giving the visitors a slim 43-39 advantage. Burns buried a three-pointer to tie the game during the run, which shifted the momentum in favor of the Pioneers.
From there on, the two teams traded buckets, until the Spartans tied the game at 53 apiece. Over the next four minutes, the hosts managed to grab a slight edge. Although the Green and Gold hung around and kept the game tight, the Spartans iced it thanks to a pair of free-throws via freshman guard Shaquille McFarlane at the six-second mark.
Dotson and senior forward Tyuan Williams each recorded a team-high of 15 points and crashed the glass for eight rebounds in the defeat. Burns finished with 14 points, three assists, and two steals. Torres had another solid showing with five points, five assists, and three boards.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers will look to bounce back when the return to action today. They will finish up their two-game road trip in Rockville Centre against Molloy College. Opening tip is set for 7.30 p.m.

All-Star weekend has come and gone and the final leg of the season-long race has commenced. With less than half of the season to go, this is when the true contenders emerge and roll their momentum into the playoffs. Unlike last year, when the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs were destined to meet again in the finals, there are several legitimate teams from each conference who have a chance to make it to the finals this year.
The East
• It might be a little early to say for sure, but recently Derrick Rose has begun to show flashes of his old self. Over his last two games, Rose has scored 53 points on over 50% shooting, while only recording two turnovers. The Chicago Bulls are a contender even if Rose doesn’t play like this, but when he does, Chicago has an opportunity to come out of the Eastern Conference.
• Since their 19-game winning-streak ended against the New Orleans Pelicans, the Atlanta Hawks finished 3-2 headed to the All- Star break. It is obvious that Jeff Teague, the first-time All-Star, is driving the train with his aggressive style of play along with a great group of supporting players such has Mike Scott, Dennis Schroder, and Kyle Korver. With Atlanta’s great record, the only thing left to prove is, will this unselfish strategy continue in the playoffs?
• Last, but not least, the Cleveland Cavaliers and LeBron James have finally began to look like the offense that many people believed they could have over the last couple of weeks. LeBron and Kyrie Irving have seemed to develop a chemistry that allows the offense to run smoothly without impeding each other’s space. On the other hand, Kevin Love has taken a backseat, but who doesn’t when LeBron James is on your team?
The West
• Although the Memphis Grizzlies don’t hold the top spot in the western conference, they appear to be the most legitimate contender. The core with Michael Conley, Zach Randolph, and Mark Gasol have been through several deep playoff runs over the years and are likely to make another one this year. The addition of Jeff Green goes a long way in adding athleticism, but is still not the scorer or the athlete that Rudy Gay was.
• Don’t look now, but the lowly Oklahoma City Thunder have finally crept into striking distance of the 8th seed. The Thunder have won three straight games going into the break, and are only a half game back of the Phoenix Suns. Three of their next four opponents have losing records, which keeps the window for their playoff chances wide open.
• The San Antonio Spurs are not done yet; they have won seven of their last ten games heading into the break. Despite the Spurs winning games, Kawhi Leonard has struggled over his last three games, going 11-for-41 from the field. The Spurs are arguably the best coached team in the league and have a lot of veterans and, as history tells us, you can never count them out.
The season is far from over and higher seeds are still up for grabs. It will be interesting to see if Cleveland can begin to show signs on the defensive side of the ball as they have on offense. While in the west it is almost a guarantee that the standings will continue to shuffle until the season’s final days.

On Wednesday, Feb. 11, the women’s basketball team (14-9) defeated the Mavericks from Mercy College (8-15) to win their third-straight East Coast Conference game. Their 72-59-victory was powered by the reigning ECC Player of the Week, senior guard Chelsea Williams, who poured in a game-high of 23 points in front of the Pratt Recreation Center faithful.
The Mavericks got the scoring started on the afternoon, but after that it was all Pioneers, as the Green and Gold went on a 20-2 run in the game’s first seven minutes, dominating in all facets. They kept their lead for the rest of the half and extended their cushion to 23 points via a lay-up from junior guard Quanisha Ratley. The Pioneers headed to halftime, up 41-26 on the scoreboard.
In the second half, the Pioneers didn’t let their foot off the gas, as they maintained a double-digit lead throughout the latter stanza. The Pioneers dominance was due in part to their tireless work on the boards. They out-rebounded the Mavericks by ten and were led by junior center Nyasia Davis who grabbed 14 boards. To go along with her 23 points, Williams dished out eight assists, grabbed four rebounds and blocked five shots. Senior guard Ashley Castle added 11 points to help out the cause.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Feb. 14, when they traveled to Sparkhill, N.Y., to face off against the Spartans from St. Thomas Aquinas College (11-14). The visiting Pioneers got behind the eight ball early and couldn’t recover, losing by a score of 77-69.
Following the opening tip, LIU started the game off very sloppy, missing three field goals and committing four turnovers. Trailing 6-5 early, the Spartans made a statement on their home court with a huge 17-0 run that set the tone for the rest of the game. The Pioneers committed four more turnovers during that span and the hosts held a 45-28 edge at halftime.
The second half was more of the same for the Pioneers, as they were never able to chip away at the lead and gain momentum. A few 5-0 spurts were answered with buckets by the Spartans, which eventually put the game out of reach.
For the game, red-shirt senior forward Jessica Little had a team-high of 15 points while Williams scored 13 on her own. Davis added 11 points and eight boards while Ratley chipped in with ten points. As a team, the Pioneers never really got going offensively, explaining their low field goal percentage of just 34.
As for the Spartans, sophomore guard Samantha Burden had a game-high of 18 points and grabbed six rebounds while freshman guard Jenna Erickson poured in 17 points. The Spartans felt it from long range, as they shot an even 50 percent from deep and also shot close to the same percentage from the field.
Head Coach Deirdre Moore and the Pioneers will try to rebound from their loss as they take the court today against the Molloy College Lions. Tip-off from Rockville Centre, N.Y., is scheduled for 5 p.m.
