 This pumpkin-spiced time of the year is when many recall, and rewatch some of the most classic horror movies in cinema history. This year, an unexpected newcomer has revealed itself, from the shadows and jump scared millions of people across the globe. The movie serves as a brutal wake-up call surrounding a visceral and real problem our society currently and continues to face. “It’s fascinating, it’s ultimately scary to think we are constantly being manipulated by technology that people invented,” said senior English major Julianna Orlassino. “The idea that addiction and consumerism were part of the intentions, not necessarily maliciously, but inherently for the sake of profit.”
“The Social Dilemma”, released on Sept. 9, focuses on the unintended consequences social media and technology has had on the world. The film discusses the severe, and unintended consequences that social media, and blue light screens, have caused for our youngest generation, as well as those who are on their way out of this world. These alarm bells are being rung by the same people who unintentionally engineered the problems we are all facing.
The documentary is filled with confessions from tech giants who created these problems. “It’s expected because in some ways we all know how technology and social media have taken over the world as a means for communication, popularity, consumerism and even addiction. The unexpected part is having people admit to it, laying it all out there for us to see,” said Orlassino
 Speakers in the movie discussed why technology today is so problematic. Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt said in the documentary, “Deaths by suicide in the US are up 70 per cent in older teenage girls compared with the first decade of the century, in pre-teen girls, suicide has risen by 151 per cent.”
 Students were stunned by this information. “What scares me the most is the fact that we all, in some ways, just sit back and let it happen. We’ve become indifferent–passive–settled for what is instead of constantly hoping and striving for what could be,” said Orlassino.
Tristan Harris is the Co-Founder of the Center for Humane Society, and is featured prominently in the film discussing what exactly the problem is. Harris, in addition to several other Silicon Valley giants make viewers aware of consequences such as exponentially increasing suicide rates among young teens, as well as newfound neurological and behavioral changes that are shaping our future society. 
The documentary also focuses on how corporations and technology innovators are very aware of the problem. “We don’t bring phones into our bedrooms, period. Or we don’t bring phones to the dinner table.” said former executive of Facebook and CEO of Pinterest, Tim Kendall in the documentary. This led to the discussion of how social media played a part in the 2016 election. “The news feed [on social media sites] found this very weird pattern, that any post that had this one word in it would always get clicked, always get shared, and always get liked, and get lots and lots of comments, what was that one word? It was Trump.” said Harris in an interview with Bloomberg News hosted by Emily Chang. “That word was a pattern matching signal to the news feed (algorithm) that this is a guaranteed way to get engagement; so whether it was a positive story or a negative story, his name, and his ability to say outrageous things became a self reinforcing phenomenon.”
 Harris points out that social media corporations as well as technology innovators are very much aware of the potential consequences in people’s behavior. The film displays massive chaotic unrest surrounding the events leading up to and following the 2016 Presidential Election. The purposeful censoring, augmentation and removal of information created hostile environments for advocates on both sides of the political aisle. 
These facts alone speak volumes about the nature of social media and the consequences that developers themselves are aware of, but their customers are completely in the dark about. On Oct. 30, 2020, Harris appeared on “The Joe Rogan Experience”, where he told viewers that “The Social Dilemma was seen by 38 million households in the first 28 days”, and Harris goes on to guess that the actual viewer count is more likely to be close to the 40-50 million range. Tackling very serious subject matter such as teen mental health, and the unintended ramifications of having our lives broadcasting for millions to see, this movie was extremely thought-provoking.

The Northeast Conference Commissioner Noreen Morris recently announced the 2021 championship cancellation for Indoor Track and Field due to COVID-19. The championship event was scheduled for Feb. 19-20 at Ocean Breeze in Staten Island, New York. The NEC council decided canceling the event was the most cautious action to assure the safety of student-athletes. The lack of ability to reschedule, indoor gathering restrictions in New York, and maintaining social-distancing guidelines also played a role in the decision. 
The absence of a championship undoubtedly affects athletes. Tara Hernandez, a senior on the women’s track team, is upset about the decision. “Not having a championship affects us physically and mentally. We are all now training without the main goal of most of every sport, which is the conference championships,” she said. The team is now training for the spring season and making sure to stay healthy. 
Destyn Harding, a senior on the Men’s track team, was devastated by the announcement. “My initial reaction was an extreme disappointment. I realized that I would not only be able to compete in my senior season indoor championships, but I would have never competed at an NEC Indoor championship,” he said. “I was injured during the championship last year, and I was not able to compete, so having this happen two years in a row makes it worse.” 
Team members are disappointed that their first or last championship opportunity has been canceled. “People are upset because they are unable to compete in their first or last indoor season.  But we are trying to be positive and look at it as more time to improve and stay healthy for the outdoor season,” Harding said.  
Despite this troubling decision, the conference athletic administrators provide athletes with competitive opportunities for the Spring semester. The NEC Outdoor Track & Field Championships are scheduled for May 1-2.

On Tuesday, Oct 27, the Los Angeles Dodgers cemented themselves in history as the 2020 World Series champions. A team defined by resilience, the Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays four games to two, avenging their 2018 and 2017 World Series defeats to the Boston Red Sox and Houston Astros.
A meaningful title in more ways than one, the 2020 season was an important one for MLB fans after the cheating scandal centered around the Houston Astros that rocked the 2019 offseason. MLB opened an investigation that confirmed the Astros illegally used a camera system to steal signs during the 2017 regular and postseasons; a season that ultimately ended with the Astros defeating the Dodgers in a nail-biting seven game series.
Senior Arts Management major Brianna Saverino was thrilled with the result.
“Once the Yankees were out, all I cared about was seeing the Astros not win,” she said.
Some critics of the championship point to a shortened regular season as a reason to put an asterisk on the result, however Sophomore broadcasting student Joseph Lonegro disagrees with this sentiment.
“I wouldn’t put an asterisk on this season. Every team had the same opportunity,” he said. Twenty Nine other teams lost just like every other year.”
The championship breaks a 32 year title drought for the Dodgers dating back to 1988, and is the 7th championship in the teams history.
With the season finished free agency began on Sunday, Nov 1.

Post will be moving to remote learning after Thanksgiving break on Nov. 30 until the start of the spring semester on Feb. 1. Students were informed of the schedule change by an email sent out by Chief of Student Affairs Michael Berthel on Tuesday, Oct. 27, six days before in-person classes resumed on Monday, Nov. 2.
The spring semester will consist of social distancing protocols such as daily self-checks and requiring masks in public spaces and will also be suspending breaks such as Spring Break and President’s Day.
In the email from Berthel, Post claimed to be keeping students updated with information regarding changes on campus as they occur.
“It has been important for us to communicate with you regularly and share information as it becomes available,” the email said. “While we understand that the need to adapt and change is a necessity throughout this pandemic, we remain committed to keeping you informed every step of the way.”
Some campus residents were shocked by the news.
“I couldn’t believe what I was reading,” sophomore veterinary medicine major Sarah Henderson said. “I wish the school had told us in advance that this would be happening because I know so many other schools that told their students this before the semester even started.”
Other residents were not surprised. 
“I wasn’t really that shocked to be honest,” sophomore musical theatre major Sara Wally said. “I kinda saw it coming because I knew Thanksgiving break would be really hard for out of state students to go home and come back.
Residents are now rushing to make plans for the rest of the semester.
“I already got my plane ticket,” sophomore musical theatre major BrayLynn Willis said. “I’m from Colorado and I’m not going to wait until last minute to go home. It’s not worth it to stay on campus.”
Wally is planning on going back home to Oklahoma for Thanksgiving and staying for the remainder of the semester. She was disappointed about staying home during the last three weeks of classes.
“I wish they would have allowed in-person classes to be an option for students,” Wally said. “That way the students who weren’t going home for Thanksgiving could continue to take classes in person I think in a lot of ways it sucks for those students.”
Henderson is from Washington state and worries about the time difference.
“When we went online last year, my 8 a.m.’s became 5 a.m.’s,” Henderson said. “I already know I am going to have a hard time re-adjusting to online classes so everything being earlier is going to stress me out.”
Henderson further spoke about how some of her classes are completely unable to be online.
“I paid to take horse-back riding lessons and they’re going to be canceled,” Henderson said. “It makes me think of all of the arts and hands-on veterinary classes that can’t be online.”
Wally worries about theatre classes online.
“I’m pretty much used to online classes by now, but it doesn’t make online theatre classes any easier though,” Wally said.
Students are trying to be understanding of the school’s decision due to the circumstances of the pandemic and recent spread of over 60 cases on campus since Oct. 14.
“There’s nothing we can even do about it,” Willis said. “It’s shocking and it’s natural to feel misled. I’m sure a lot of students would not have paid to live on campus if we knew we would lose so much of the semester. It’s a complete waste of money and time. However, I think given the circumstances and how so many people will be traveling for Thanksgiving, LIU is stopping a potential outbreak on campus.”
Students hope that classes will return to being in-person next semester, but the email from Berthel did not state whether in-person classes will resume next semester.
 “I’m grateful that they [will probably be] in person,” Wally said. “I’m hoping that we have learned from everything that has occurred this fall and we won’t have any repeats of parties and a rise in cases. I hope that the school will continue to enforce the rules and CDC guidelines and students who chose to break them will be reprimanded.”

Celebrating Halloween was different this year because of the pandemic. Holidays such as The Fourth of July and Easter, as well as birthday parties and other social gatherings, have already been affected by social distancing guidelines and personal decisions to stay home during these times. As COVID-19 cases rose in the U.S., people debated how to spend Halloween.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised against traditional trick-or-treating this year.
“Many traditional Halloween activities can be high-risk for spreading viruses,” the CDC said on their website.
Their website states that door-to-door trick-or treating, trunk-or-treating, indoor parties and haunted houses are among the riskiest Halloween activities when it comes to preventing the spread of COVID-19. 
Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo said that trick-or-treating would be allowed on Halloween. People were still expected to follow the CDC’s social distancing guidelines for holidays. The CDC recommended lower risk activities such as carving pumpkins with family or friends at a safe distance or doing a Halloween scavenger hunt where children could walk around and admire Halloween decorations at a distance. Other low risk alternatives were having a virtual Halloween costume contest, or having a Halloween movie night with family. A good moderate risk alternative to normal trick or treating suggested by the CDC was participating in one-way trick-or-treating, where individually wrapped goodie bags were lined up for families to grab and go while continuing to social distance. 
In previous years, most students would gather for Halloween-themed parties. But this year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most students opted to make other plans. Whether it was because of travel restrictions, group gathering restrictions in NY and on campus, quarantine, or just being cautious of the virus, there were several factors that impacted Halloween plans for college kids. 
Junior musical theatre major Shelley Dean kept staying safe to be her top priority this Halloween. 
“I think COVID has obviously changed my plans for Halloween, as it has changed every plan I’ve had for the past seven months,” Dean said. “Normally, I would see a lot more people, maybe go out, but this year I’ll definitely be doing my best to keep myself and everyone around me as safe as possible.”
Other students chose to celebrate with their roommate in their dorms, and some still chose to attend parties despite the risks.

Two students, in conjunction with the Promise office, are starting a podcast about being Resident Assistants. Jack Tomlinson, a junior physical and health education major, and Nick Del Buono, a junior secondary education major, are co-hosting “Beyond the Residence Halls Podcast,” which will first drop on Nov. 3. 
“Nick and I both came up with the idea of a podcast one day when we were just talking. We both knew coming into this semester due to Covid-19, RAs wouldn’t be allowed to hold in person RA programs. So, in an attempt to create a program that would interest people and be fun to host we realized we could just do exactly what we were doing in that very moment, talking, except the only difference now is that we film it,” Tomlinson said.
“We actually got the idea from RA Nick Jordan in Brookville hall. As we were all brainstorming ideas to do virtual programs, he brought up this idea for a podcast and I texted Jack right away,” Del Buono said.
The podcast may be titled about resident life, but it is meant for all students. “I believe our podcast offers a variety of content that although geared towards the general LIU student it still holds elements that can make the experience more direct for the viewer,” Tomlinson said. 
“Beyond the Residence Hall” will be hosted on the LIU Promise instagram page the first and third tuesday of each month.  
Podcasting is an easier and safer way to get to connect with other students. “Personally, I love podcasts, I find them incredibly informative and entertaining. I also believe they allow for a more intimate relationship with the host. Which is the overall goal as an RA, to build trust and comfortability with your residences, except now we can do it with not just our residences halls but the entire campus as well,” Tomlinson said. 
“Jack and I are doing our production together. We are experimenting with ways to get the best performance,” Del Buono said. 
As an RA, Tomlinson is always looking to build a relationship with his residents. “As an RA all I can ever hope for is to be able to develop a safe and trusting relationship with my residences so that they feel comfortable to come to me with any situation no matter that magnitude. With the help of our podcast, I am hoping for the same opportunity with the entire LIU Shark Nation.”

Michaela Fox (‘20) has published a book based on her missionary work experience. Entitled “Denim Apron,” the book is a fictional story based on true events that Fox experienced while working at the Sanctuary in Lourdes, France.
As president of the Newman Club, Fox had the opportunity to travel with the campus minister to serve with the North American Volunteers, a Catholic organization who help take care of the seriously ill and disabled.
“The title, ‘Denim Apron,’ is meant to be a sort of double entendre, I suppose you could say,” Fox said. “Denim is an iconic, American staple in fashion, and aprons are very feminine. Denim Apron is, in this way, a unique way of saying “American woman.” It is also the affectionate nickname given to the main character, Arden, by other nurses and volunteers from within the piscine (baths), as she wears the only denim apron of all the other volunteers, who each simply wear a blue, cotton apron. This is an element of the story that was based on real events, as I wore the only denim apron available when working in the baths, and one day, a piscine matron actually called me “Denim Apron.”” 
When talking about the book and the story line behind it Fox describes it as “three love stories in one, which is purposefully reflective of the Holy Trinity from Roman Catholic Dogma. The book details the journey of Arden Bradley as she falls in love with herself, another man and ultimately, her God.” 
What really helped Fox accomplish completing this book was “the feeling, deep within my chest, that I was meant to write it. I felt called to it. I could never shake the feeling that part of the reason I was there that summer was to be inspired to write this book.” Fox’s advice to new writers would be “to not give up. Keep going, and keep on writing. Take your necessary space to breathe and find silence and never rush your process, but don’t quit. Especially because it is your story, and you have every right to unashamedly tell it. Be honest, be true, be imaginative.” 
“Denim Apron” is available now on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited and available as a paperback on Amazon.
