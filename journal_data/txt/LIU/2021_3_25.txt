Sunday, March 14 was the 63rd annual Grammy Awards, this year the ceremony was aired differently due to the ongoing pandemic. The show had some performances which were pre-taped and others that were live, but this also was the first Grammy’s in over 40 years that was not produced by Ken Elrich who was in a swarm of controversy over allegations that the Grammy’s was following a rigged system. 
Dozens of artists such as Nicki Minaj, Halsey, the Weeknd who boycotted this year’s awards have criticized the awards including Zayn Malik who took to twitter on March 9 and said
“F— the Grammy’s and everyone associated. Unless you shake hands and send gifts, there’s no nomination consideration. Next year I’ll send you a basket of confectionery.” 
Malik then followed up on twitter the night of the ceremony saying his tweets were “not personal or about eligibility but was about the need for inclusion and the lack of transparency of the nomination process and the space that creates and allows favoritism, racism and networking politics to influence the voting process.” 
Former bandmate from One Direction Harry Styles was up for two nominations for Best Pop Vocal album for his second album “Fine Line” and Best Music Video for “Adore You,” Styles also opened the ceremony with a performance of his single “Watermelon Sugar.”
Some students agreed with Malik and the other artists who have called out the award show.
 “I think the Grammys are overrated and outdated, I’ve seen people I’ve never even heard of in my life winning awards, and actual talented artists get no recognition. I start to think they do it for the reaction of people,” senior broadcasting major, Jason Glickman, said.
Jahaila Harley, a junior nursing major, had the same sentiments as Glickman but watched it anyway. 
“I do think the Grammy’s definitely has a system behind it that has ulterior motives but I still watched this year’s awards as a distraction, Beyonce looked amazing,” she said. “I remember watching when Nicki Minaj was snubbed and Kanye in 2016 so I definitely agree with Zayn, artists have been saying this for years.”
The star studded event had some big wins, such as Megan Thee Stallion who took home Best New Artist, Best Rap Song for Savage Remix and Best Rap Performance with Beyoncé by her side. Meg and Cardi B also took to the stage for a late night rated performance of their hit song “WAP”  which got a lot of buzz. 
Both Beyoncé and Taylor Swift made history last weekend Beyoncé becoming the most awarded artist in Grammy’s history with 28 awards accredited to her, surpassing bluegrass singer Alison Krauss who previously held the title. Beyoncé was awarded Best R&B Performance in honor of “Black Parade” which was released on Juneteenth in honor of Black power and resilience. 
“As an artist, I believe it’s my job to reflect the times, and it’s been such a difficult time,” Beyoncé said in her acceptance speech.
 Taylor Swift made history by becoming the first female artist to win Album of the Year three times. Swift was awarded Album of the Year for her quarantine album “Folklore.” 
Doja Cat’s futuristic performance of “Say So” received a lot of praise, as well as Dua Lipa’s performance which fans loved. Senior broadcasting major James Waldhof was surprised by some of the wins and losses, and performances. 
“I’ve never listened to Dua Lipa before but I have seen older videos of performances by her and I was shocked at the improvement in her live performances, he said. “I was really impressed. I was also happy that Kaytranada won for Best Dance/Electronic album because I had gotten into his music last year and it is nice to see him get such a high recognition.” 
Overall, the night wasn’t too disappointing for casual viewers like Harley. 
“Besides some of the performances, I wasn’t disappointed with some of the wins this year in the categories I care about. I was disappointed that Chloe X Halle didn’t win for the two nominations they had because I really thought Ungodly Hour was one of the best albums to come out of last year. “

The Grammys is a music awards event where many celebrities style themselves in designer and extravagant looks in order to stand out on the red carpet. Some celebrities that attended the Grammys in-person this year include Megan Thee Stallion, Lizzo, BTS, Bad Bunny, Harry Styles, Jhené Aiko, Taylor Swift, and Beyoncé. 
Artists this year wore outfits from brands like Balmain, Gucci, Christian Louboutin, Louis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabbana, and Schiaparelli. Students found that some celebrities were fashion hits, while others were flops at the Grammys.
Noah Cyrus wore a white Schiaparelli Couture gown. 
Freshman English major Walker Timmins is a fan of Noah Cyrus, but didn’t like her outfit. 
“I really like Noah Cyrus, but I just couldn’t get behind her outfit. It looked like she was surrounded by bedsheets,” Walker said. “The actual dress itself was a nice, simple white dress, but the rest of her outfit looked like bed sheets.”
Each of the members of BTS wore different Louis Vuitton outfits. 
Freshman education major Matt Daniels liked how each member showed their own style in their outfits.
“I thought their outfits were really cool,” he said. “I don’t listen to their music but their outfits really stood out to me. I loved how some of them had pretty traditional-looking outfits and others didn’t. One had an oversized jacket, some wore dress shoes, and others wore sneakers. Each of their outfits was unique, and they looked really great as a whole group.”
Jhené Aiko wore a pink dress by Monsoori, with jewelry by Sydney Evan. 
Junior broadcasting major Jules Martinez has been a huge Jhené Aiko for six years, and loved Aiko’s outfit. 
“I think she looked gorgeous, she always does,” Martinez said. “Her pink dress was so beautiful and classy. She was one of the most elegant-looking artists at the Grammys this year.”

The Rainbow Alliance is introducing the “Every Dorm a Worm” fundraiser to spread some joy around campus. The popular toy “Squirmles,” otherwise known as “Worm on a String,” are available to purchase via Venmo from now until Friday, April 2. All proceeds from the fundraiser go to The Marsha P Johnson Institute, a group that supports Black trans people and is currently aiding in covid relief efforts.
“This year, and likely for multiple years to come, we’ve decided to send our charity donations to The Marsha P Johnson Institute, and the page on their donation page could explain more than I ever could,” senior game design major and Rainbow Alliance president Nicholas Frank said. “We hope to donate as much as we can to stop breeding grounds of hate and empower Black trans people, and we hope to have a larger virtual event later in the year for donations that we hope to get out more information about soon.” 
These nostalgic critters come in a variety of colors and can be delivered with a message for two dollars. Each purchase also counts towards a raffle where a lucky student can win a massive five-foot worm on a string. Worm purchases are not limited to students, however, students must be on campus for a dorm room delivery or to participate in the raffle. 
This unique fundraiser was an idea from Frank himself. He wanted to hold this fundraiser for some time now, and he is delighted to finally share these worms with the public during his final semester. Many people have connections to these toys and with midterms on the horizon and no spring break, now is as good a time as any to give someone a fuzzy friend. 
Sophomore Art Education major Loredana Citizen was happy to support the fundraiser. 
“I remember the first time I saw a worm on a string. I was in third grade and a fifth-grader was using one,” Citizen said. “She made it look like this was squirming through their fingers and it was a magical experience. Then in college, my roommate had some worms on a string which rekindled my love for the silly creatures.”
Students can follow @liupostrainbowalliance for updates on the fundraiser and to receive information on future events.

The Biden administration has promised to implement a gentler and more open system for foreigners who wish to come to America to start a new life, a stark contrast to the previous administration’s stance on immigration. 
On President Joe Biden’s official website, there is a stated promise to end the “unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants.”
However, the Biden administration now deals with an uncontrollable surge in migrants at the border. 
As of Monday, March 15, over 100,000 migrants have been apprehended at the southern border, including around 15,000 migrant children, many of whom are unaccompanied. 
“We can’t keep up,” border patrol agent Juan Rossi said in an interview with CNN. “This is the biggest surge we’ve seen in 20 years, and it’s time the administration does something about this.” 
In an interview with ABC, Biden discouraged migrants from trying to enter the U.S., especially those with children. 
“I can say quite clearly: don’t come over,” Biden said. “We’re in the process of getting set up. Don’t leave your town, city, or community.” 
When asked how Biden plans to deal with the situation at the border, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki conveyed to reporters that Biden is tackling the problem head-on. 
“I would say that his focus is on developing solutions, pushing his team, encouraging his team, to develop solutions that will expedite processing at the border, that will open more facilities that will ensure kids are treated with humanity and also treated safely.” 
When Psaki was asked as to whether or not the current situation would signal to Central American migrants that the U.S. is open to mass immigration, Psaki dismissed such a connection. 
“I wouldn’t make a direct connection,” she said. “I would say it’s just something where we want to make sure that our system is prepared for to manage the process effectively and smoothly.”
Some students are confident that the current commander-in-chief will be able to find a solution to the problem. 
“I’m sure that Biden will be able to solve the problem,” freshmen political science major Brendan Palmice said. “Trump was all about yelling, but Biden can calm down and look at a problem without all the racism and fear mongering.” 
Sophomore history major Michael Filone agreed with Palmice. 
“I wouldn’t trust Trump to deal with this issue,” he said. “The situation at the border only got worse when he was in office. So much for ‘Build the Wall’ and having Mexico pay for it.” 
Other students, however, expressed concern about Biden’s inability to properly navigate the situation at the border. 
“Biden’s message is essentially ‘let them all in’,” junior English major Hunter Parisi said. “Does he not know there’s a pandemic going on? Who knows what these people have. We’re full. Go away.” 
Senior history major Patrick Scangarelo agreed with Parisi. 
“I love how all the Democrats are now blaming Trump for the problem at the border now,” he said. “If they let him go forward with his immigration policies, I bet we wouldn’t have this issue. Do we even have a country anymore?” 
As of right now, Biden has not stated any plans to go to the border, and the administration has refused to call the current situation a “crisis.”

Is Mr. Potato Head no longer a mister? This spud sparked outrage when Hasbro officially announced they will be dropping the “Mr.” from their toy brand “Mr. Potato Head” on Feb. 25. Hasbro’s statement confused many, and as tweets started flooding in, facts about the name change became misconstrued. 
The Potato Head brand is not dropping the “Mr.” as a result of public scrutiny, the Potato Head packaging may have a new logo, but the Mr. and Mrs. titles are not leaving the individual toys. The company decided to alter the name to better reflect the brand and promote their new toy the “Potato Family Pack.” This product, planned to release in the fall, includes blank slate potatoes with a plethora of pieces so children can have more variety with their creations. Without the set genders, the potatoes can be changed to better reflect modern day families. 
Freshman art therapy major Olivia Glusic, initially heard about the potato head debacle on the news and was surprised by the removal of the “Mr.” 
Glusic believes people are upset about the change simply because it seems unnecessary. This opinion was shared by sophomore speech pathology major Beau Braun.
“There was already a Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, and they are both husband and wife. Why get rid of the Mister? It just made no sense,” Braun said.
Braun, along with many other students, were not aware that it was the company altering its name, not the individual toy.
“I guess if they’re keeping the toys’ names the same, just changing the company name, then it makes a slight difference,” he said. “They aren’t changing something that didn’t need changing, it’s just a rebranding.” 
Freshman fine arts major Camila Lausso, didn’t mind the change.
“[It’s the] same product, just a shorter name. It’s still the same toy kids can enjoy, it seems kinda pointless to get worked up over something like that.” Lausso said.  
Sophomore forensic science major Kayla Gonzalez heard about the name change from her parents who were complaining about the rebrand. 
“I think people are upset that many things are changing to be more gender-neutral, and they fear it’ll negatively influence their kids somehow,” Gonzalez said. “It’s ridiculous because it’s a plastic toy.”
She noted the fact that the brand is still differentiating their toys by Mr./Mrs. Potato Heads and Gonzalez struggles to understand why people remain upset. 
“People only hear [or] read what they want to, especially if they already have similar views on other topics,” Gonzalez said. “I think they just want to start arguments and get their point across without having all the facts.”
