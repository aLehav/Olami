On Thursday, Sept. 30, the music department was given breaking news: the music education major is being frozen. This means that any incoming student at Post may not choose music education as a major, but the students who are already part of the program will be able to finish out their degree.
More news came for other arts students soon after. On Oct. 8, students in the department of theatre, dance and arts management received word that recruitment into the dance and arts management programs would freeze after this school year. 
With programs freezing, students are left wondering if they should stay at Post and what the future holds for their education.
“We got an email from Dr. McRoy who is the director of music education. He wasn’t beating around the bush at all. He just said ‘unfortunately the school has decided to freeze the music education major,’” sophomore music education major Ally Perticone said.
A large majority of the students found out this information while they were in chorus class.
“We were in chorus and everyone’s jaws dropped. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. After all the time and effort we put in,” senior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung said.
The music education majors and their faculty have worked hard to build their program.
“I want the administration to know that people are hurting. It’s not only us, it’s also the faculty. I feel very bad for everyone in my department, especially the faculty because I know how much hard work they put into this. I see the hard work that everyone puts in,” sophomore music education major Mike Shapiro said.
Students in the program thought that  all of their hard work and effort was paying off, especially seeing as the university advertises the music program on various media platforms.
“I think it’s just really unfair. The school portrays their music program and all the opportunities we have here as this great big deal, which it is,” Perticone said. “It’s a really good program we have here. But I hate that they portray it as something bigger than it is. If it’s so great, why are they getting rid of it?” 
There is even a banner on campus stating that Post was rated the best music school on Long Island.
“This program is so near and dear to me and to watch it be ripped away from future students is heartbreaking,” Sottung said.
Some students hope that others will join them in trying to fight for their program, while others think there’s no chance of restoration.
“When they took away the Fine Arts Center (FAC), we were able to advocate for ourselves and help restore the program by having the school put practice rooms in Hillwood. So, I think if we really get the word out and talk to higher administration to fight for our program, it might help,” Shapiro said.
“I personally think that fighting for it isn’t going to work. This is not something we can change their minds on. I don’t think it’s worth trying for,” Perticone said.
The next steps for the music program are unclear at this time, as students and faculty alike continue to grapple with this sudden change despite the decision that the school’s administration made. It’s clear the music community on campus is still strong, and will continue to focus on their craft as long as the school’s administration allows them to.
Students from the dance and arts and administration department are also fighting for their programs.
Junior dance major Abby Steinke recalls all of the opportunities she has received through Post’s dance program.
“We’ve had the opportunity to see companies and work with artists that are high calibre. We’ve been able to choreograph ourselves, like I’ve gotten to choreograph and make my own artistic voice show,” Steinke said.
Steinke says that the Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC) is like a family. She doesn’t think she would be the person she is today without it.
Steinke and the rest of PCDC found out Friday Oct. 8 that their program was to be frozen at the end of the year.
“I was shocked,” Steinke said. “The first thing I wanted to do was be like, okay what can we do to stop it? I’ve been emailing administration, and I messaged the theatre company to email them. I think strength in numbers really works. I think if everyone has something to say about it, then they should listen.”
Steinke has some ideas on how to get the campus’ attention, other than emailing.
“We’re thinking of doing some video things, maybe some flash mobs. The dance program has a big presence in the department, but we need to make that known to campus,” Steinke said.
Steinke believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on this decision. She says that last year the dance program was meant to bring in 13 new students, but ended up only bringing in three. 
“I think we need a chance to grow as a program through the pandemic and not getting a chance seems unfair,” Steinke said.
Steinke’s next steps are getting as much attention as possible from as many people as she can.
“Email your president, email Promise, email your dean, email our dean, email chairs; email anyone you can. These programs are important and they are bringing more people to this school. They are bringing culture to this school, arts to this school,” Steinke said.
Steinke urges the administration who is cutting these programs to listen to the students.
 “Please listen to the student body, please listen to what we have been sending you, please reconsider the freeze,” Steinke said.

After spending almost an entire school year virtually on Zoom, this year’s student government association (SGA) is working towards an enjoyable 2021-2022 school year for students.
Many students stayed home due to the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing guidelines, so this school year is imperative for students yearning for a fun year that is in-person again. The SGA is hard at work making improvements for a better college experience this year. 
The SGA president is senior business major Robert LaPollo. LaPollo spent his days at home until being active in Greek life and student government, which prompted him to become more involved on campus. He grew more interested by participating in Greek life, which led to his involvement in other areas. “I walk around campus and see things that need to be changed, I hear from my peers, and it’s really cool to be able to do that and be in a position where you can have those conversations with the right people and make that impact,” LaPollo said.
LaPollo has held various leadership positions, so taking on the role of SGA president was not unusual for him. He has previous parliamentary leadership experience at Phi Sigma Kappa, where he is currently vice president, which led to him running for SGA president.
As president, LaPollo is prepared to address several concerns of students on campus.
The first issue that SGA worked to resolve was the reopening of the Pratt recreation facility. 
“People pay a lot of money to be here, and they believe they have the right to use the gym, and we (SGA) agree,” LaPollo said. The virus’s spreading has been significantly reduced since last year; however, the gym was only accessible to student-athletes during a planned lift. At the same time, the nearest gym outside of school is 30 minutes away. Many students have expressed their annoyance with the gym being closed. Therefore, LaPollo has had daily talks with the university to resolve this issue on campus. The fitness facility has finally opened to all students on campus as of Thursday, Oct. 7. Students can now access the gym Monday through Thursday from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m., Friday from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m..
The next priority for SGA is to improve the food quality at Winnick Dining Hall. With a lack of dining alternatives on and near campus, students believe that the dining quality at Winnick and Hillwood needs to improve. Students have also voiced dissatisfaction with the food not being properly cooked, the lack of options and the limited hours. SGA is collaborating with AIRMARK and the administration to achieve better food quality. As Winnick closes as early as 8:00 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, SGA is seeking to expand the hours the dining hall is open because they recognize students’ schedules differ significantly.
Aside from SGA campus goals, LaPollo has a few personal goals he hopes to achieve as president. He is excited to become more involved with everyone on campus. 
“My main goal on campus is getting students to understand what we do and getting them to understand we have the ability to make a difference and we are always here to represent them,” LaPollo said. He intends to accomplish this goal by engaging in one-on-one talks with students. In addition, he wants to build relationships with other clubs on campus, notably The Tide.
SGA intends to have a “meet the SGA event” at The Shark Bite, where students can meet members of the student government. Furthermore, students will have the opportunity to ask the SGA any questions they may have regarding campus life, or voice any concerns they have.
SGA also wants to hold a student awards event next semester. Students on campus would contact SGA and nominate students who they feel deserve recognition for their contributions to the campus. This event has never been done before, and it is in the planning stages.
SGA is an organization that wants students to know they can count on them to be the voice of the students. They would love nothing more than to serve as the student’s connection with the school. 
“People used to come to SGA for their concerns and problems in the past, but access is becoming more and more difficult now that we are back in person,” LaPollo said. “We want to let everyone know that if you have an issue or a need, please come to us [SGA].” 
If students have any concerns or issues they want to address, or want to become involved in organization, email SGA at post/sga@my.liu.

According to the American Cancer Society, one in eight women will develop breast cancer within her lifetime. The prevalence of this cancer spawned a movement, known as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, lasting the entirety of October to promote education about early detection and screening. This month, in support of this international campaign, The Student Body Boutique is having a “Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign”, where students who spend 20 dollars or more in the store this month will receive a free breast cancer awareness scrunchie. 
Sophomore fashion merchandising major and head of merchandising of the Student Body Boutique, Anna Johnson, reflected upon the upcoming event.
“[The campaign is] a time when you can identify with other people who have gone through the struggle of having someone in their family who has breast cancer.” 
The campaign is more than just a promotion of early detection and testing, but rather, an opportunity for conversation and empathy. 
In 2016, Johnson’s life changed when her aunt, Apryl Roberts, was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. She now faces regular chemotherapy and an onslaught of daily medications which have stripped her of her once very active lifestyle, yet this diagnosis has not taken away her spirit. Johnson describes her aunt as “the badass with breast cancer” and “the strongest person [she] knows.” 
Johnson’s personal experience with breast cancer is her greatest motivation for involvement within this event in order to empower women to start conversation and educate themselves upon early detection. She adds that it is the goal of the Student Body Boutique to truly uphold and advance the values of these culturally relevant movements. Moreover, the Student Body Boutique intends to promote those same beliefs among their customer base and educate them with regard to the significance of their campaigns. 
Junior musical theatre major Hannah Winston’s grandmother passed away on Oct. 11, 2016 from breast cancer.
“She was diagnosed with stage four, and it spread to her leg. She was so scared of losing her hair, but she never lost it,” Winston said. “She was a big smoker. One of the first things we did when we found out we helped her quit smoking cold turkey. We got her nicotine patches and fumigated her house. She came and lived in our house for a bit. It was good to have her there. She fought really hard. We were fortunate to have her with us for as long as she was before she passed.”
Winston’s family became advocates for breast cancer awareness, she recalls having her grandmother’s name on her volleyball shirt for pink-out games in high school, and attending numerous fundraising events to support cancer research.
“It has instilled a lot of community in my family. It’s important to support people when they need it most,” Winston said. “If you’re a woman, you need to get tested for breast cancer. You need to be proactive, or you will find out too late. It’s too important to not be on top of.”
When the overabundance of merchandise dawning pink ribbons are cleared from the shelves of stores, media presence of the disease begins to dwindle and October comes to a close, it continues to be the responsibility of men and women alike to promote awareness. It is key to understand one’s risk factors pertaining to sex, age, family history and race. Although it is not likely for the students of Post to develop breast cancer, as its primary victims are women ages 55 and older, an understanding of signs, symptoms and prevention methods may be of support to those individuals whose loved ones suffer from breast cancer. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms can vary among affected individuals, or may not present at all. Symptoms include lumps on the breast or underarm, pain, abnormal discharge, morphological changes and irregularities of the skin, including redness and dimpling. 
While there are many irreparable risk factors including age, genetic mutations, extended hormonal exposure due to early menstrual periods, family/personal history and previous radiation therapy, there are methods of risk reduction. The CDC recommends maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, limiting alcohol, breastfeeding and corresponding with healthcare professionals regarding the risks of inherited changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, as well as the risks of hormone replacement therapy and birth control.

Throughout the start of the fall semester, a contagious cold has broken out on the Post campus. This has sparked concerns over the infamous COVID-19 virus. While some students have tested positive for COVID-19, others are experiencing similar symptoms from a common cold. 
  “I started to feel sick right after I found out one of my sorority sisters tested positive for COVID-19,” junior musical theatre major Renée Hamilton said.
Some students in Hamilton’s sorority started feeling sick after attending school in-person for the first time in a while.
“I was nervous to go back to school in person because I knew it would spark COVID-19 cases on campus,” Hamilton said.
Her symptoms were eerily similar to that of COVID-19.
“I had a terrible cough, runny nose, scratchy throat, a constant headache,” Hamilton said. “Every symptom you could think of for COVID-19. I wasn’t the only person sick though, my entire suite caught the cold.”
Hamilton’s roommate, senior health sciences major Mikaela Strub, also caught this cold. The two were tested multiple times for COVID-19.
“Renee and I both got rapid and PCR tests,” Strub said. “Luckily, they both came back negative, which was a sigh of relief. But we still had an annoying cold to deal with.”
Missing classes due to illness has caused some students to fall behind in their classes.
“I was extremely worried that my teachers were going to give me a hard time about being on Zoom instead of in-person, “ sophomore art therapy major Olivia Glusic, who also caught the common cold, said. “I only missed three days, but I fell behind on my class work and needed to ask for extensions and extra help.”
With COVID-19 rules and regulations still up in the air, it is a time of uncertainty for most. The Biden administration recently released a vaccine mandate for all federal workers. For those who are unvaccinated, they must be tested for COVID-19 weekly.
“I think it’s a fantastic idea to have all workers be vaccinated or tested a lot,” Hamilton said. “I know it would make me feel a lot safer if everyone on campus who is unvaccinated got tested weekly.”
Hamilton was not the only one who felt this way.
“I think weekly testing for those excused from the vaccine would be so helpful for our campus community and it would really keep everyone safe,” Strub said.
Some students are concerned that there is not currently a nurse on campus.
“We absolutely need a nurse on this campus. Students are in need of medical attention daily, and especially with the pandemic, I believe a nurse and medical staff are absolutely a necessity for a college campus,” Glusic said. “Being sent to Urgent Care or NYIT does not cut it.”

First time college students create expectations in their head about what college is going to be like years before they actually get to college. Students see many of the positive aspects about being on their own, but being away from home for the first time is an adjustment that takes some getting used to. Now that the school year is nearly a month in, freshmen that are living on campus feel adjusted to college life. 
Choosing which college to go to can be difficult, especially when a student is leaving their home state. Freshman biology major Madysen Bradley from Colorado chose Post for multiple reasons, but mostly because of the challenge that Post brings. 
“I chose LIU because I felt like I could get a very well rounded experience,” she said. “I wanted something academically that would challenge me but not overwhelm me, and I feel like LIU gave that to me.” 
Being away from family is what’s making the adjustment to college life so hard for Freshman Kira Sanchez, who is majoring in nursing and also from Colorado.
“I think I’m adjusting well. Though there are many times where I definitely miss home, life here has been extremely fun and all the people I have met have been so welcoming,” Sanchez said.
Students can participate in extracurricular activities, becoming a student athlete and joining clubs to fill gaps throughout the day and make friends. Freshman Karsyn Foster majoring in health science is on the gymnastics team at Post and really enjoys it. Leaving her home in Texas was relatively easy for Foster 
“I was not nervous to come to college, I was more ready to be here than anything. For the last four years I had been dreaming of becoming a D1 gymnast and the time was finally here. The 28 hour drive was definitely not fun, but spending that last little bit of time with my parents before being here alone was very nice. I do miss my family, but I don’t think I’m ready to go home quite yet, especially to the Texas heat,” she said.
Over time, college prepares students to become more independent for their families before they are living on their own.

The U.S. has had a long-winded, cross-millenia spanning occupation of Afghanistan; from Seal Team 6 assassinating terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden in May 2011, to more recent issues surrounding the newly established Taliban control over the country.
The U.S.’s decision of withdrawal from Afghanistan ended a nearly 20 year occupation of the country, as well as one of the longest wars that the U.S. has been involved in. Occupation first began after the attacks by militant Islamist terrorist group al-Qaeda on Sept.11, 2001. Now, after the bombing of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, the U.S. evacuation sought to retreat both military troops and threatened Afghans. This has left Taliban rule with sole power over the country. With this, many issues arise with the terrorist regime’s take on government.
Taliban control of the country could mean an end to a basic education for Afghan women. Since the initial overthrow of Taliban rule by the U.S.in 2001, Afghan women have had the right to an education. Women who were educated were able to hold a wider range of professions than women under Taliban rule. New professions that women could pursue included those in business, medicine, law and government. Under current Taliban policies, women are unable to attend school.
“When schools reopened Saturday for grades seven through 12, only male students were told to report for their studies,” a New York Times article said. “The Taliban said nothing about girls in those grades, so they stayed home, their families anxious and uncertain about their future.”
For students, this is rather polarizing news. As current students undergoing the process of seeking higher education, many can’t imagine a situation in which they would be unable to continue their own learning.
“I think it’s definitely not good,” sophomore business administration major Stephanie Sheridan said. “Obviously women, children and everyone should have the right to go to school and do what they want. I personally haven’t heard a lot of media coverage on it. I wish there was more so I knew what was going on.”
Students are wondering why they haven’t heard more on this subject.
“I hear about [news] from Twitter and Instagram, and it’s just the way that young people get their news nowadays. On campus, we don’t have cable, so social media is how I usually get my news; trying to find a reliable source online is really difficult,” junior acting major Allison Vallario said. “Instagram and Twitter, and all of these clickbait [articles] are trying to draw certain crowds to certain opinions.”
Taliban spokesman and acting deputy minister of information and culture Zabihullah Mujahid said that they are working on providing transportation for a better educational environment, and that classes for women in grades seven and up should continue soon.

Kanye West released his highly anticipated tenth studio album “Donda” on Aug. 29 after multiple delays. The album was preceded by 3 listening events – the first two held at the Mercedes-Benz stadium in Atlanta and the third at the Soldier Field in Chicago. 
However, upon the release of Donda and fan excitement, West took to social media to claim the album was released without his approval.
The listening events served the purpose of gaging public opinion of the music and making alterations accordingly before officially releasing the album to the public on streaming services and physical mediums. 
Although it was unpredictable and erratic, students on campus enjoyed the “Donda” release process and all of the visuals and performances that came along with it.
“Kanye has no obligation to anyone but himself to release the best music he is capable of making, that being said, I don’t mind the unpredictable schedule, in fact, I’d rather him not put out an album each year merely for being formulaic or predictable,” senior communications major Dante Della Porta said.
“I thought the release parties and the whole stage setups were really cool as well,” sophomore veterinary technician major Kaitlin Cucolo said.
Students on campus believe West’s irregular album releases make him a better creative and other musicians should consider following in his footsteps.
“I think every artist can afford taking a break, and having their projects gradually exposed and worked upon,” Della Porta said.
“It’s a good idea for artists to get an honest opinion of what fans like and don’t like and the opportunity to know and correct mistakes,” Cucolo said.
One month after the release of “Donda”, Kanye West made changes to the album on streaming services. As pointed out by a reddit user, the changes are the replacement of KayCyy on “Keep My Spirit Alive” and Chris Brown on “New Again” – both replaced by West himself and the Sunday Service Choir. More minor changes include changes in the mixing and mastering of “God Breathed”, “Come to Life” and  “Jail Pt. 2.” 
This is not the first time West has made post-release changes to his music – he did the same with his albums “The Life of Pablo” in 2016 and “Ye” in 2018. 
“In the months to come, Kanye will release new updates, new versions, and new iterations of the album. An innovative, continuous process, the album will be a living, evolving art project,” West’s label Def Jam said about “The Life of Pablo.”
West has stated that he believes his albums are “living, breathing, changing creative expressions.” However, students on campus share differing views on West making changes to music after it has been officially released to the public.
“People constantly forget that the artist’s legacy is their legacy, not your experience of their legacy. So I think if artists themselves feel as if that’s worth it, they should do so,” Della Porta said.
Other students disagree with the concept of artists making drastic alterations to music after fans have already listened and enjoyed it.
“I don’t really think that’s a good idea. If I love a song, I don’t get why you would do that,” Cucolo said.
As for the changes West made to “Donda,” students again shared opposing views as to whether they made the album better. The removal of Chris Brown caused the most outrage. Brown himself has shared his disapproval of his minimal involvement on the final version of the album calling West a “whole hoe” in now deleted social media posts.
“The one with Chris Brown I was upset about because I loved Chris Brown on the song with Kanye. I’m sad about it, but I guess with the first release he didn’t get to release all the creative thoughts in his head, ” Cucolo said.
However, other students fully believe West should fulfill his creative vision, no matter the backlash, and are happy with whatever West decides is the final product.
“This is Kanye’s album, not an album Kanye made for you. He makes it because there will be someone somewhere who likes it for what it ends up being, and not for what it was at first,” Della Porta said. Since its release in August, the album has been certified gold by the RIAA and amassed close to 200 million streams – across all streaming platforms – on its first day. “Donda,” including all the changes, is available to listen to on all streaming services.

After over one year of distance, zoom, and a virus keeping campus’ only improv troupe apart, they are back together. No Control had their last in person performance on Feb. 14, 2020. Since then, they have been making students laugh over zoom and from well over six feet apart. 
Similar to many clubs on campus, No Control has been abiding by strict rules in order to keep everyone in the troupe and the audience safe. 
Everyone performing is required to receive a negative COVID-19 test at least 72 hours before they perform, and all members of the troupe are staying at least ten feet away from audience members at all times. 
With these rules in place, No Control members can perform without masks, something that has not happened nearly anywhere in the world since the beginning of the pandemic.
Senior theatre arts and international relations major Matthew Sporrer has been a part of No Control since his freshman year. He is ecstatic to be back performing on a stage.
“The reason that I did theatre for so long was the audience, so then losing that aspect was really hard, but then bringing that back, I just can’t wait,” Sporrer said.
On top of senior members such as Sporrer, the troupe has also added two new members this semester. 
“I’m looking forward to seeing how our new members grow and develop because they’ve had their rehearsals but they’ve never really seen what this is. I am also excited to see the freshmen and sophomores sit in the audience,” Sporrer said. 
This will be the first in person performance that any freshman or sophomore will have been able to attend, as all No Control and Post Theatre Company shows were filmed or produced on zoom last year.
“As much as no theatre really works over zoom, Improv works even less. Because improv is 100% reliant on being in a room with each other, and being able to quickly respond to each other and play off of one another,” Sporrer said. 
Sporrer is excited to be in a room where wifi and connection issues won’t be a problem.
Other members of No Control are specifically excited for the energy a live audience brings during an improv show.
“Improv is so interactive with the audience, it’s really a conversation between you and the audience, more than any other show I would say. They are directly involved. They are asked, “What is the show you want to see?” masters business administration student and No Control member Steven Prestia said.  
Prestia joined the improv group his sophomore year of undergrad, and has seen it grow throughout the stages of the pandemic. 
“It’ll be good to get that catharsis out yet again for this coming year,” Prestia said.
Prestia is ready to perform, and cannot wait to get to the other shows that No Control has in store for this year.
Throughout this transitional period, the co-presidents of No Control have been finding ways to prepare their troupe for an audience without the physical presence of one. 
“For half the troupe this is their first time in front of other people ever, and so we told them all that we could, and prepped them with all the games but ultimately, we just have to put our best foot forward,” senior acting major Steele Whitney said.
Whitney makes up one half of No Control’s leaders, along with his co-president Jordan Horne. 
“We’re showing everyone what we can do. We’re trying to highlight our two newest members. It’s really about bringing back the laughter and good times that we used to bring to LIU,” Whitney said. 
Whitney is finding ways to balance safety and entertainment with the troupe during this time. By following all of the university provided rules, he feels confident that the troupe is being as safe as possible.
“We’re actually doing more than Broadway in some ways as they are closer to the audience than we will be,” Whitney said. 
As for the future of No Control, Whitney is looking forward to upcoming performances and having fun with the troupe once again.
“We want this semester to be about getting the troupe to a place of comfort in front of an audience and remember for ourselves what that feels like so that way next semester we can really knock it out of the park,” Whitney said.
If you missed Saturday night’s show, be on the lookout for upcoming performance announcements. Sporrer, Prestia and Whitney promise the next show is one you won’t want to miss.

Post biology professor emeritus Bill Schutt released his newest novel “PUMP: A Natural History of the Heart” on Sept. 21. Schutt is a vertebrate zoologist and author of six nonfiction and fiction books. 
On Thursday Oct. 7, Schutt held a book signing event at Post in the Krasnoff theater. He also gave a presentation on several of the many stories his book follows from the recovery and exhibition of a blue whale heart to the industry based around the blood of horseshoe crabs, accompanied by illustrations by Patricia Wynne that are featured in the book.
After finishing his previous book “Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History”, Schutt was presented with a list of potential topics for his next non-fiction book, one of which was the heart. Schutt expressed that he was initially hesitant to pursue such a topic that has been written about many times before. However, after some research, he began to look at the topic in a different light.
“I probably looked at it for a week or so, and the stuff that I found just blew me away. There was so much intriguing history. There were interesting examples in the animal kingdom, like Antarctic ice fish with anit-freeze in its blood,” Schutt said. 
Schutt worked on his book for approximately a year and a half. Traveling to places like Toronto and researching while also teaching at Post full time. 
In April 2014, the bodies of two blue whales washed ashore off the southwestern coast off the island of Newfoundland, Canada. One of the hearts of the whales was recovered and later displayed in the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. The recovery and preservation of the heart is documented in Schutt’s book. He was able to travel to Toronto to see the heart himself, as well as interview the curators and scientific assistants that performed the recovery.
“The exhibition [in Toronto] of that blue whale heart had closed, so [the blue whale researchers] had crated it up and put it in this big warehouse. They broke it out for me, so I was able to see this thing. When I saw it for the first time I’d seen pictures of it, but it was in a big exhibition hall. To be able to walk up to it just was amazing,” Schutt said. 
However, while some topics covered in his book about the heart provided experiences such as seeing the blue whale heart, according to Schutt, were a bit more difficult to approach.
“Some of the topics were difficult. Baby Fae was difficult. That was a transplant of a baboon heart into a desperately ill infant in 1984 and that whole story got mega press back then,” Schutt said.
In 1984, a surgery was performed by Dr. Leonard Bailey on an infant known as Baby Fae with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. In an attempt to save her life, a baboon heart was transplanted in place of her own damaged one, making her the first infant subject of a xenotransplant procedure and first successful infant heart transplant. 
“When the media got hold of the Baby Fae story, it just became huge and even though Baby Fae died twenty days after the surgery, which is truly tragic, the ramifications of that surgery just improved medicine tremendously. There were no donor hearts of neonates, so after that media blitz, when [people] had desperately ill babies that died, they had [the infants’] hearts donated. Bailey did upwards of two hundred infant heart transplants over the next twenty years. There was never another baboon transplant. So, that was a difficult topic to approach, but ultimately it turned out to be a positive story,” Schutt said.
While writing his book, Schutt also experienced the typical editing process of leaving behind a section of his research that he enjoyed.
“I wrote this whole chapter about this Aztec warrior who gets captured and he gets marched up to the top of this pyramid. Then the priests lay him down and then they open him up and pull his heart out, and that’s how I was going to explain the difference between a neurogenic heart which the horseshoe crab would have and a myogenic heart where the beat is coming from within the heart itself. My editors were afraid that if I had this really cinematic scene, then it would sort of interrupt the flow of the book, so it got the boot,” Schutt said.
While the Aztec scene was cut, the final draft still kept the informational section about the horseshoe crab and its neurogenic heart. Schutt even used it as an example of his presentation in the Krasnoff theater to demonstrate how different organisms have circulatory systems that are much different than a human’s, but still work just as efficiently. Schutt stated that out of the several main points he’d like his readers to take away from his new book is the idea that just because other organisms function anatomically and physiologically different from humans doesn’t mean they are necessarily primitive.
“A lot of people look at hearts in the animal kingdom and sort of look down on them because they’re not the spectacular four-chamber beauty that we hold… Even though there are all sorts of different ways to get this job done, which is to circulate oxygen and carbon dioxide and waste and nutrients, they all work, and they all evolve to do these jobs and they do them very well.”
Schutt continues to research and share his knowledge with readers and is currently working on a book about teeth. He says that he wants to pursue another fairly common topic similar to the heart that he would be able to research and have strange takes on.
“If you look at dental history, it’s crazy. A lot of my friends are paleontologists and most of what we know about ancient animals is based on teeth. Whether it’s now climate or diet or what type of animal this was and what its feeding behavior was,” Schutt said.
The book is expected to be finished in May and get released sometime next year.

In honor of one of our society’s most beloved cult classics, Oct. 3 is known as “Mean Girls” Appreciation Day. 
In 2004, the world was introduced to Cady Heron and the infamous group of tyrants that we all love to hate in the blockbuster must-see, “Mean Girls.” This film became an instant classic for young women around the world. 
“Mean Girls” became a pioneer of ‘chick-flicks’ by exposing the true toxic culture behind a realistic high school experience. Young women everywhere found themselves laughing at the quick-witted humor of the film’s outrageous characters, all while relating to their struggles of being in high school. 
Over the years, “Mean Girls” became an iconic film for fans to obsess over in many ways. From the bold outfits, to the ‘fetch’ catchphrases, all the way down to the suggested humor, “Mean Girls” evolved into a culture of its own. 
After being released over a decade ago, the film remains just as relevant and popular as it was in 2004. 
“Personally, I feel it’s stayed relevant all these years for many reasons. It’s amazingly funny all while showing viewers a glimpse of how some highschool girls and highschool life can really be. Girls all over the world wanted to look like, act like, and even in some ways be these girls. It just really impacts fans because it gives us real life situations that we can all relate to,” junior psychology major Anastasia Hernandez said. 
“Mean Girls” has earned an iconic spot in our society for several reasons. It’s reputation for teaching young adults relevant life lessons about growing up in an American high school culture was a major one. 
Throughout the film, we follow junior exchange student Cady Heron. Heron experiences the best and worst that high school has to offer she even shows viewers about living in the consequences of her actions. 
“At a young age, “Mean Girls” showed me how social dynamics can impact us and even help me put all the ridiculousness of life’s petty dramas into perspective. It showed me what I didn’t wanna do. I loved this movie growing up because at the end we even see how you don’t need to be popular or pretend to be something you’re not just to fit in,” Hernandez said. 
Throughout this 90 minute film, viewers are introduced to some serious life lessons that are articulately camouflaged with comical lines and hysterical situations. It’s the memorable moments like these that viewers carry with them when the movie is over. 
At some point, each character delivers a jaw dropping line that fans still quote 17 years later. Viewers have incorporated the characters’ banter into their everyday lives. Fans have even adopted some of the characters’ absurd rituals and rules. These culturally diffused jokes have even become the way fans choose to celebrate “Mean Girls” appreciation day every Oct. 3. 
“‘On Wednesdays we wear pink’ is one of my favorite moments in the movie, and it always stuck with me because of how funny it was. So every October 3, it’s only right,” Hernandez said.
Fans are given many moments like this to remember the film by; whether it be an outrageously conceded secret from Gretchen Weiners, a cruel comment from Regina George, or all the truthful tells from Damien and Janis Ian, fans are never let down when it comes to quotable moments to remember this 2004 hit classic. 
So every Oct. 3, remember to pay tribute to some of the film’s characters and never wear hoops (those are Regina’s thing), remember the girls world rules for Halloween and always wear pink on Wednesdays.

 Professor of film and acting at Post  Robbie Tan played Billie Ross, a character in the HBO miniseries “Mare of Easttown”. The series was nominated for 16 Emmys this year and won four.
“To see the show was a part of the Emmys, it was very surreal,” Tann said. 
Tann started his fourth year of teaching at Post this September, and wasn’t quite sure how students and viewers would react to his part in the show. 
“The fact that people did get into it was incredible and to see those actors be commended for their performance, it was really special,” Tann said. 
Senior musical theatre major Ricky Dobbs was surprised to see his professor on television. 
“It’s really interesting to pull up a TV show on HBO Max, and then turn around and take a class from someone we just saw on TV,” Dobbs said.
Dobbs values Tann’s knowledge and experience working on a TV production, and says that it gives him a unique perspective as a professor. 
“He speaks from first-hand experience most of the time and provides us with scenarios from his own journey in class. He blows our mind constantly revealing industry tricks in the filmmaking process,” Dobbs said.
The actor and professor takes pride in preparing his students for their careers in the constantly evolving field of acting.
 “I do a lot to transition students from having a theater focus for the majority of their time at the school into this whole new territory of TV and film,” Tann said.
Students appreciate Tann’s incorporation of television and film directing into his teaching. Senior acting major Steele Whitney is grateful for the opportunity to learn from someone who is so knowledgeable.
“He is teaching us a lot about the art of film acting, and it is really great that it all comes from his first-hand experience,” said Whitney. “It is really exciting to be so close to someone who deserves all the positive attention.”
Dobbs echoed Whitney’s feelings and has been very receptive to Tann’s approach to teaching. 
“Every class he is putting us behind the camera to help give us a look into how a film set may be run and to help us learn the craft of TV acting because it differs so much from the theatre training a lot of us have been focusing on for the last three or so years,” Dobbs said.
Tann emphasizes that he is hoping to savor this moment while also looking to the future as an actor. As he reflects on his journey as an actor, he stresses the importance of perseverance. 
“When people graduate there’s thousands and thousands and thousands of actors; if you can just hang in for 10 years, your odds are going to be significantly better because lots of people are going to quit, lots of people are going to give up,” he said.

The Sharks started their 2021 football season on the road against three elite opponents, as they faced the Florida International University Panthers, the West Virginia Mountaineers, and the Miami Redhawks. In each of these games, the Sharks were outmatched. All these matchups happened on the road against powerful teams in conferences of the FBS, while the Sharks compete in the Northeast Conference(NEC) of the FCS, so the Sharks knew these games would be an uphill battle. Luckily for the Sharks, they got two bye weeks before facing their first NEC opponent, the St. Francis Red Flash. 
Weighing in on the last few games, Junior cornerback Tariq Snead believed that they played better than many fans might believe.
“When you actually watch the film, we played a lot better than the scoreboard showed,” he said. “The film actually showed a lot of promising things.”
The star defensive back also stated that the last three games will help them when they start conference play later this season. 
“These last three games gave us a lot of experience against better opponents,” he said. “The teams in our conference aren’t going to be as fast and physical as the teams we just faced, so that experience will help us a lot when we start playing teams in our conference.”
Snead also expressed his optimism regarding the changes the Sharks plan to make heading into their NEC schedule. 
“After the last few games, we were able to change up our defense in terms of personnel and schemes,” he said. “I think that if we focus on the stuff that has worked for us so far this season, we have a great chance of beating St. Francis and going on to compete for the championship.”
Snead and the Sharks are confident that they will bounce back after their start to the season. The 0-3 LIU Sharks made their return to the NEC when they faced off against the 1-3 St. Francis Red Flash on Saturday, Oct. 9 at DeGol field in Loretto, Pennsylvania. 
In an Interview with WCWP campus radio, Head Coach Jonathan Gill confirmed he and his team were looking to make the right adjustments heading into kickoff. 
“We reflected on all the same types of things we started the year with. Hustle all the time, and playing with great energy. We want to be very physical when we have the opportunity to do our job,” he said. “That’s what we set forward back in august and we continue to make progress on a daily basis.”
With all the non conference action over, Gill continues to push the same way every game and not take any opponent differently. 
“Every week is an opportunity to test yourself and see where you are as a football team, anything in life you’re gonna have good streaks and bad streaks. We obviously had a streak that wasn’t too successful, we were overmatcheiped and that’s gonna happen in football sometimes,” he said. “I think there’s some positives that came out of it and I look forward to the boys using some of the things that were positive and building off those things and the things that weren’t positive gave us a lot of things to work on.”
LIU is the last team to play an NEC game, as they started their season with three FBS opponents followed by two weeks off.  According to Gill, scouting your opponents must stay consistent even under these circumstances. 
“I don’t think it plays to an advantage or disadvantage. At the end of the day people are scouting film like we are, and all our opponents played at least one non conference game,” he said. “Every time you put on the film it’s your resume, and a chance to scout your opponents, make your coaching adjustments and decide your game plan from there.”
After all the time off, Gill states his team is ready to start attacking and make a push in the NEC.
“I think the boys are anxious to get playing again. It seems like it’s been longer than two weeks, but regardless of who the opponent is we want to give it our all and come off the field with a victory,” he said. “Every football game is like a tug of war with two sides and whichever side executes their game plan will come off with the victory.”
The game did not go as planned for the Sharks. While they got off to a great start, it would be a rough game against the Red Flash. 
On the Sharks second drive, they were able to go down field to the Saint Francis 6 yard line, where Paul Inzerillo would convert a 23 yard field goal, giving the Sharks a 3-0 lead. This was the Sharks first lead of the season, and just about all they would get as the game took a turn from there. 
On the next drive, Saint Francis’ wide receiver Josh McGrigg scored a 49 yard receiving touchdown, which opened up the scoring for Saint Francis and gave them the lead 7-3 with 3:39 remaining in the first quarter.
Saint Francis would go on to score 48 unanswered points, until the Sharks scored a touchdown on a Paul Shemar 6 yard run with 7:48 remaining in the 4th quarter. Two plays into the Red Flash’s next drive, Tobee Stokes would score on a long 74 yard run, making the score 55-10 with 6:46 remaining. 
McGrigg would also have two more touchdowns on special teams, including a 59 yard punt return, and a 94 yard kick return, an exceptional day all around for the Red Flash graduate student. 
LIU looks forward to next week’s game against the Merrimack College Warriors on Saturday, Oct.16. Merrimack and LIU have been rivals for a long time going back to when LIU was the Pioneers. They competed together in Division II in the NE-10 conference, and moved up together in 2019 to the NEC. Since their Division I start, Merrimack and LIU are 1-1. The Warriors won their first matchup in 2019 24-10, and the Sharks took the edge in the shortened season this Spring, winning 31-20. Merrimack is 3-3 on the season, and 0-2 in conference games this season. This will be LIU’s homecoming game, and their first home game of the season. They look to turn around their 0-4 start, and get their first win against a familiar opponent. This is the first game since 2019 that LIU will have fans and students in attendance to watch.

There’s a new hockey team heading to Seattle, WA. Complete with a blue ocean theme, this team will fit right in with the Seahawks, Mariners and Sounders. 
The Seattle Kraken will begin their inaugural season on Oct. 12 against the Las Vegas Golden Knights. The last time Seattle had a hockey team to cheer for was in 1975. The Seattle Kraken are the long-awaited successors to the Seattle Totems.
In Dec. 2018, the NHL granted approval to Seattle Hockey Partners to form an expansion franchise. In July 2020, the name “Seattle Kraken,” along with the logo, was introduced to fans. 
The Seattle Kraken will compete as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference. Their home stadium is Climate Pledge Arena, formally known as KeyArena. Amazon purchased the naming rights to highlight their goals with the environment. 
Fans in Seattle are getting excited for the first major hockey season in the city since 1975. 
Lifelong Seattle resident Emily Baker is looking forward to the moment the Kraken begin their highly anticipated first regular-season game. 
“I am extremely excited about it honestly, I’ve been meaning to get into Hockey since high school, and I was going to just pick a team from Canada and just start rooting for them,” she said.
Baker is ready to have a home team to root for and feels this was the motivation she needed to truly get into the sport and feels lucky to know what it was like to grow up in a sports-centered environment. 
“No matter what team it is, we’re always blindly supportive. We’re the kind of people that show up to enjoy the sport,” she said. “I think Seattle is just incredibly supportive, no matter what team it is.” 
Baker hopes that the support from fans will be enough to get The Kraken through their first season successfully. 
“I feel like our location is surrounded by a lot of cities that love hockey, so that’s promising based on our location alone,” Baker said.
“It’s nice to finally have an NHL team. I know that after we lost to the Sonics, KeyArena needed a new home team to rally behind,” fellow Seattle resident Chase Mellinger said. 
Baker and Mellinger were both shocked yet satisfied when the NHL announced the team’s name last July, and are happy with the color schemes and designs of the jerseys and merchandise.
“Kraken is a great name. The colors are great, in my opinion. I know some people were a little mad about the name, but I think it’s fitting,” Mellinger said. 
Baker feels the new colors perfectly balance what the other Seattle teams already have while adding a unique modern touch.
Baker is looking at the broader picture and hoping this new team will mean something great to her city.
“I feel like this brings a new era to our town, a new appreciation for something that we didn’t have before,” she said. 
While Baker and Mellinger have an inside look at the Seattle Kraken, students on campus are watching this new team build itself up from across the country. 
Junior broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher is a long-time hockey fan and is following the news on the league’s newest team.
“They have a good future set up with a lot of young prospects and some veterans,” Boettcher said.
Boettcher is a New York Islanders fan and feels energy with professional hockey is unmatched anywhere else.
“The fighting is interesting, and it’s very entertaining. The playoff atmosphere is nothing compared to any other sport besides maybe football,” Boettcher said.
Boettcher does not feel the Kraken will produce at a high level right away and thinks it will take some time before they become a team to be feared.
“Personally, I don’t think they’re going to be a playoff team like the Golden Knights were. I think they’ll be competitive, but I don’t see them making the playoffs,” he said.

Post Theatre Company (PTC) debuted the first show of the season on Friday, Oct. 8. “Everybody” written by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and directed by Galia Backal, featured nine performers pondering the question many have: what happens when we die?
Sophomore musical theatre major Ren Mummert was excited to play the character Love in “Everybody”, and said that the show was one of the best experiences of their life.
“Everybody is about your journey through life and at the end of it, what you get to take with you when you die,” Mummert said. “It’s a beautiful satirical look at the way people live their lives. It also makes you question the way you treat yourself and other people and why you do. At the end of the day, no one escapes death. All you are left with are the good and bad things that you gave to this world. I’m so grateful for this show because everyone in this show is so interconnected, I made some of the best friends that I’ve had in a while through this show. We truly bared our souls to each other and we are connected in a way that is so meaningful that I think we will always remember each other with the utmost respect.”
Due to social distancing protocols during the pandemic, Mummert had never experienced an in-person performance with PTC.
“I went into theatre because I love nothing more than affecting an audience and feeling the physical energy in the room shift throughout the course of the show. That is something virtual theatre can simply never match,” they said. “To be on a stage again in the lights and without a mask on (tested and vaccinated) was surreal. It made me remember why I love what I do so much.”
While “Everybody” had four cast members with permanent roles in the show, five students played “somebodies”. The “somebodies” played a different role in each show, and had to memorize the entire script. 
“It was really stressful and hectic to memorize almost the entire script,” junior musical theatre major Hannah Winston said. “But it was interesting to get different roles each night. It was so surreal to see how unexpected life and death is because we weren’t able to plan which role we were going to play. It made our roles so much more real to us because we weren’t really playing people. We wanted the audience to be able to see themselves in the characters. Seeing how each actor played each different character was important to show the true meaning of “Everybody”.”
While Winston enjoyed all of the characters she played, the character Everybody has a special place in her heart.
“As terrifying as it was, I felt like I personally could play Everybody how I wanted to. It was me talking, I was the vessel for the content,” she said. “It was different in me than any other cast member playing Everybody. We could connect with that role through ourselves, which is so important in acting.”
Along with the first show of the PTC season, PTC had its first “toast” for the cast and crew members of “Everybody”. Toast is a PTC tradition after the opening night of each production in which the cast and creative team are commemorated for all of their hard work towards the production.
“I felt very happy and celebrated during our toast,” Winston said. “Bringing back live theatre to campus felt very special.”
Mummert agreed.
“It felt so wonderful to be recognized and to be able to recognize the other amazing people who work on our show,” they said. “Sometimes, the tech crew doesn’t get as much limelight as they deserve, and it’s so important that we take that time to celebrate them. It also felt like a celebration of rebirth. Theatre had just come back after what felt like an eternity, we were all rejoicing in what we had once again.”
