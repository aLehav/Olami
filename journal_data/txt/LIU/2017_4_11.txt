On Friday, April 7, the LIU Global Institute hosted Adam Schiff, the U.S. Representative for California’s 28th congressional district, in a conversation on global policy and current events.
Congressman Schiff, a Democrat, is the Ranking Member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which began hearings last month on Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Former U.S. Representative Steven Israel, the chairman of the LIU Global Institute, invited Schiff to the Brookville campus to offer his perspective on current events.
About 40 people, including students and faculty, attended the program. Israel opened the talk by outlining five global trends that will develop over the next 30 years. In the year 2040, it is stipulated that 1.2 billion people will be added to the population, there’ll be the largest growth of the elderly due to advanced medical technology, 60 percent of the world’s population will live in cities, mostly everything will be made by robots as the result of accelerated technology, and world powers will fight wars not over borders or ideologies, but over resources, such as food and water. Schiff then offered his intel expertise, which was followed by a brief Q&A session.
The main issue that Congressman Schiff addressed was the U.S. military strike on a Syrian airbase the evening of April 6. The airstrike was launched in an effort to combat chemical attacks that killed dozens of civilians earlier in the week. Israel mentioned that Schiff was informed of the attack just minutes before he was set to appear on “The Rachel Maddow Show” that night.
“It proceeded to be a momentous day in the institution of Congress because the Senate leader used the nuclear option [to gain approval of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee], and effectively turned the Senate into the House, and that wasn’t a good thing,” Schiff said.
The Democratic Congressman described that the military strike on Syria abdicated congressional power to declare war, another example of how the Trump administration is executing a broad interpretation of the Constitution, resulting in a “terrible confluence of interest.”
“We’re now using [the] authorization to use force against those responsible for 9/11 against a different group, Isis, that didn’t even exist at the time and indeed has been at war with Al Qaeda,” Schiff said.
Congressman Schiff also discussed U.S.-Russia relations, stating that the existing tensions are not a result of conflicting economies as in the past, but rather conflicting governments. “Putin is at the vanguard of an autocratic movement around the world, and the pushback against those forces has always been a coalition of Western democracies led by the United States, and right now the leadership of that is very much at risk,” he said.
Schiff described Donald Trump as Russia’s “dream candidate” for U.S. office, someone who would disparage NATO and do away with sanctions if elected, encouraged Brexit, and talked eagerly of other countries leaving the European Union. “It’s the perfect way to take down the American democracy, and discredit the whole idea of democracy around the world,” Schiff said. “And there is the danger.”
The Congressman stressed the importance of Americans understanding exactly how the “Russian cyber onslaught” influenced the 2016 election. “They’re very sophisticated in their media, in how they use paid media trolls and bots so that they can [manipulate] social media [so] the stories that are critical of a candidate they don’t like rise to the top.”
Schiff and Israel answered questions mostly regarding President Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin, his accusations against Susan Rice, and his fervent tweeting tendencies.
Whereas Schiff said that past presidents would have renounced Russian interference in a U.S. election, in Trump’s case it was invited. “How can we accept foreign involvement in our election and not repudiate it?” he asked.
The LIU Global Institute offers members of the university community access to global and national leaders in many facets of American government. Student-leader events are designed to facilitate discussions about top, pressing issues in order to deepen students’ understanding of global issues. Future Institute speakers will include Trump presidential transition team member Jim Woolsey, General David Petraeus, Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and former President Bill Clinton.

Returning to Brookville after a six game road trip, the women’s lacrosse team honored former players Trish Moran and Jackie Sileo during Sunday’s 17-3 win against the Roberts Wesleyan College Redhawks by retiring their number 11 jersey during the halftime ceremony. Head coach Meghan McNamara said that the retiring of number 11 “meant everything. Those players are legacies just like their teammates. To honor them for their contribution was incredible and they created a great environment here.”
McNamara explained the impact Moran and Sileo both made on the lacrosse program during their time at Post. “Trish Moran helped create the mold that would define the ideal athlete in the women’s lacrosse program. Whether on the playing field or at practice, she displayed a relentless toughness and hustle that will never be forgotten. Jackie Sileo is the most decorated student-athlete in our program’s history. She is the all-time NCAA points leader not just in Division II but in all three divisions.
The 8-1 Pioneers got off to a quick start by scoring the game’s first two goals in under ten minutes. With the Pioneers controlling most of the first half, the 6-8 Red- hawks only scored once and were held to nine shots on goal. The team was led by senior elementary education major Connor Bird and freshman Alyssa Mallory, both of whom scored four goals. At the end of the first half, the Pioneers led Roberts Wesleyan by a score of 8-1.
The second half was once again dominated by the Pioneers, as they scored nine goals and spent a majority of the half on offense.
Bird tied sophomore business major Ryan McKinney for the team lead in goals with 25 and earned her team leading thirty-second point with a goal in the final three minutes of the game.
Speaking about the team’s win at the end of the game, McNamara said, “it was very nice for the team to go out and push hard, we were hungry and put the ball in the back of the net. It was nice for us to get a win today.” The Pioneers finished the game with 17 goals and improved to an 8-1 overall record and a 4-0 record in the East Coast Conference.
The Pioneers’ next game is against the Queens College Knights on Wednesday, April 12 at 4 p.m. at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville.

The School of Health Professions and Nursing will hold its first annual Interprofessional Education (IPE) Student Event on April 18 from 12:30 to 2 p.m. in the Hillwood Lecture Hall. Students and faculty members will work together to understand the goals and responsibilities of a health care team.
The event will include 350 students and 35 faculty members from 10 of the department’s programs. The students will be divided into teams of 10, with each team receiving one faculty facilitator. Each team will be given a case study of a hypothetical situation that a health care team might have to deal with, and the team will have to coordinate, identify the conflicts, and learn what each person’s role in the case would be. “The purpose of the event is for students who are enrolled in health profession programs and other programs to work together as a team in the academic setting,” Dean of Health Professions and Nursing Stacy Gropack said. “So that when they go out and work in their actual practice setting as practice professionals, they’ve already had that experience.”
Gropack said students at the event will also learn about professions and disciplines they aren’t pursuing. “This event is designed to allow students who never met each other to work together in a team,” Gropack said. “So a nursing student will learn what a social worker does and what a nutritionist does so they can understand better how they can work together for the best of the patient,” she explained.
Each case study was written by the faculty of all of the different programs for a more diverse experience. Laura Prager was on the planning committee as the Nursing Department’s representative. “It was necessary for us to compose an interprofessional team of faculty experts on the planning committee that represent the various majors the students are studying here at LIU Post,” she said.
Students no longer can join at this time, but Gropack said they will extend this to other students in the future. The School of Health Professions and Nursing also plan to make this an annual event and do more events like this in the future. “This is a new initiative for LIU Post,” she explained. “The reason we’re doing this is because this is how the health care system works.”
Gropack said that between getting the faculty on board, training the faculty to be facilitators, creating the case studies, and organizing the students into groups, the planning for this event took over a year. “The IPE Planning Committee met multiple times to work through the logistics of the event to provide the students with a valuable and meaningful experience,” Prager said.
For more information about this event and future IPE events, contact Gropack directly at stacy. gropack@liu.edu or at 516-299-2486.

On Friday, March 31, Alpha Epsilon Phi hosted its second annual Pearl Gala for pediatric AIDS in the Tilles Center Atrium. The sorority raised $2,285 , all of which will be donated to Alpha Epsilon Phi’s national philanthropy, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS foundation. “This was a charity fundraiser in which we had dinner/dessert buffets, live entertainment, 30 raffles, and presentations,” Mallory Schiff, a junior childhood education major and co-chair of national philanthropy for the sorority said. The fundraiser had live music by duo Lennon and Katie, a Long Island based acoustic duo who performed at the event for free. A trunk show from local boutique Vanilla Sky in Roslyn was also featured. Some of the most popular of the 30 raffle baskets included three tickets to a New York Knicks game and a lottery ticket tree. Companies such as Pandora, OtterBox, Panera and Applebee’s also contributed raffle baskets.
“EGPAF is an organization we are proud to support and represent,” Heather Felix, a freshman public relations major and national philanthropy co-chair of the sorority, said. “While the main purpose of the Pearl Gala is to raise money for pediatric AIDS, we also wanted to make it a priority to tell people about Elizabeth Glaser’s story and how her foundation impacting the lives of children suffering from HIV/AIDS.”
Elizabeth Glaser got HIV during a blood transfusion and without her knowledge she passed it onto her kids. After her daughter passed away from AIDS, Glaser started the foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing HIV/AIDS in young children and eliminating the disease through treatment and research programs.
“This is one of the biggest events we’ve had to date and we were so happy to share it with our LIU Post community. We’d like to see the tradition of the Pearl Gala continue so we can raise more awareness and funds each year,” Schiff said.
Schiff and Felix made speeches in front of the crowd of around 135 people at the fundraiser. Schiff spoke about Elizabeth Glaser’s foundation and Felix spoke about Elizabeth Glaser’s life.
They both gave credit to their sorority sister Fallon Boyle, a senior public relations major, with coming up with the idea last year, but the sorority decided to make it an annual event. Schiff and Felix organized the event this year.

On Monday, April 24, the Writing Center will host its third annual Write-In from 12:30 – 3 p.m. on the second level of Humanities. Taking place right before the study days and exams week, this event will provide a relaxed environment for students to enjoy the company of friends, enjoy snacks and coffee while completing final papers and assignments.
Mary Pigliacelli, director of the Writing Center, is hopeful this international tradition can become one of Post’s traditions, as well. “Writing is hard. You sit alone and struggle. We want to make writing a social opportunity where students can feed off each others’ energy, bang out papers, and fight against procrastination,” Pigliacelli said.
Finals week is filled with assignments, papers and tests, putting a great deal of pressure on students. Pigliacelli emphasized that this event is not to add pressure on students. Instead, it is an event with space for students to focus on any assignment that needs to be completed with a support system, if desired.
Writing assistants will be available to offer a helping hand if students are struggling with brainstorming ideas, organizing papers, making citations, grammar questions, along with any other general writing questions. Each assistant values helping students be the best writer possible.
Kaycee Grancher, a soon-to-be graduate of the English masters program, has been working in the Writing Center for two years. Not only has working in the Writing Center helped others, it has also helped her with her own writing. “Working with students has given me a better understanding of grammar and terminology,” she said. “[Grammar] is something you never really think about, but then when you are teaching it to someone, you need to know the terms and need to relearn them which I think is really helpful.”
Grancher’s colleagues, Gabbi Battiloro and Kainat Cheema, who are also graduate students in the English department, agree with her. Their positions in the Writing Center give them a confidence boost, which they hope to give to those who visit their office. “Honestly, that’s our main goal,” Pigliacelli said. “We encourage students to read their work and listen to their words, which is so basic when you think about it,” Cheema said. “It really does help them understand who they are as writers.”
The Write-In will be centralized in the Writing Center, Humanities room 202. Tables in the hallway will have food, creating a social setting. Humanities computer lab 200 will be available for this event, as well as room 217B, which will serve as a “quiet room.” No registration is necessary for students interested. The Writing Center is open every Mon. through Thurs. from 9am to 7p.m. and Friday’s from 10a.m. to 4p.m. Appointments may be scheduled, but walk-ins are welcome. For questions, contact the Writing Center at (516)299- 2732 or post-wc@liu.edu.

Association of Finance Professionals (AFP) meets every Thursday during common hour in the trading floor room, located in the lower level of the library. The club meetings serve as a venue for students with interest in stock trading and financial markets . “What we do is teach students how to analyze global markets and propose investments to peers with confidence,” Robert Williams, a senior international business major and president of AFP, said. “The skill sets and confidence you learn in AFP you can transition to the real world.”
Ray Pullaro, assistant dean of the college of management has been helping students and faculty revive this once defunct club. “I got here in June of 2015, at the time I was really happy to find that the university was making the substantial annual investment of managing the Bloomberg terminals,” Pullaro said. “I was also really happy to find out that one alumni had donated money to make students active [LIU-iF] investors,” Pullaro said. “The club talks about investment, markets and ideas.” Before joining LIU, Pullaro was the managing director for Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, which was responsible for over $32 billion in assets.
Long Island University secured donations from alumni to establish the LIU-iF, a student run investment firm that was launched in spring 2016. On April 4, several students who are members of the AFP club and LIU-iF met with Steven Hornstein, an LIU Post alumnus and member of the Board of Trustees for Long Island University. Hornstein is a top market manager in NYC.
“We met with President Cline, deans from the College of Management and Steven Hornstein to discuss the incorporation of the student investment fund along with policies and risk management and the growth of the fund,” said Williams. “It was a promising meeting with Mr. Hornstein and he is looking to possibly play a larger role in the club and LIU-iF.” Before the meeting, Hornstein spoke to the AFP club to discuss recent market activities, future investments and students portfolios.
The AFP was defunct last fall, and has made a resurgence this semester. “They weren’t focused as much on stock markets and trading as we are,” Williams said. “Our revamped trading floor, enthusiasm for stock markets and resources of the Bloomberg terminals and experienced professionals in the field like Dean Pullaro created the perfect opportunity to have a pro markets club.”
Membership in AFP is open to students of all majors and currently stands at 15 students, an increase from the seven students who re-launched the club in January. To qualify for membership in the student investment fund, LIU-iF, students must take Finance 32 or show proficiency in investments while holding membership in the AFP club. Students involved in LIU-iF are encouraged to execute investments with the funds donated by alumni.
Junior public relations major Andrew Taylor joined the club in February with the recommendation of his friend. “We invested in stocks previously and it was a nice and fun environment where ideas flow naturally,” he said. “The club is an intellectually-challenging club that is open for all to learn and enjoy the stock market.”
“What I see the club doing is making students more educated and more interested in the stock market. Through Dean Pullaro’s mentoring I believe new opportunities will open for the club with investors, making the club even bigger,” Taylor added.

Martin Sajdik, the ambassador and permanent representative of Austria to the United nations in New York will speak to students and faculty on Tuesday, April 18 at in the Hillwood Cinema. Ambassador Sajdik visited the campus earlier this year to meet with Dean Robert Valli and the Executive Director of Grants, Internationalization, and Sponsored Programs, Dr. Al Posamentier. Posamentier then introduced Sajdik to Kay Sato, director of The Hutton House Lectures. “Upon our meeting, the ambassador immediately agreed to return and present a lecture [at the university] in the spring,” Sato said.
The ambassador was “originally selected by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to engage Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s president Petro Poroshenko in a conflict-solving dialogue,” Sato said. The ambassador will “speak to us about that experience and where the solution process stands today [in addition to] what impact the newly elected U.S. administration might have in ending the bloodshed,” Sato said.
Audience members will be able to ask the ambassador questions after his presentation.Light refreshments will be available for audience members throughout the lecture.

Summer is a time to catch up on sleep, lay in the sun, and binge-watch the shows you missed during the semester. Having no papers to write or tests to study for is a well deserved reward at the end of the spring semester. What could make a student trade sitting on the beach for sitting in a classroom?
Students take summer classes for a variety of reasons. “Students can utilize the summer sessions to speed up their academic progress, complete core requirements to make more room in the fall semester for major courses, or catch up on any academic requirements they may have missed in previous semesters,” Kaitlin Montijo, a promise coach, said. Alex Mitchell, senior dance major, graduating after three years, took summer courses “in order to get all of my core classes done in three years.” Without the summer credits, “I wouldn’t have been able to graduate,” Mitchell said.
Resisting summer fun while living at home instead of living in a dorm was something Mitchell had to face. “I definitely had a lot of moments where I would’ve rather been at the beach or hanging out with friends. I found it hard to concentrate at my house; there were a lot of distractions, one being the nice weather.” Class intensity was also difficult as a semester worth of coursework was crammed into a short session.
Aside from speeding up the academic process, students also take summer travel courses. “This is a great option for students who want to travel abroad and still gain that valuable experience without committing for a whole semester.” Montijo said. Emily Bivona, a junior dance major, received approval from the sociology department to participate in a trip to Iceland led by sociology Professor Brian Sweeney from June 3-13. “I was so excited to see the email notification from the dean of students telling me I was approved,” Bivona said. “Not only is this my first study abroad experience but also my first time leaving the country. Finances made it difficult for me to do so, however; traveling with a group of people outside of my family and being part of an educational program makes it all worthwhile.”
Summer sessions have their pros and cons. Opportunity to advance academically and travel is offered, but a homework-free break may be jeopardized. Mitchell said, “The fact that the sessions are shorter is a blessing and a curse because you do have a lot of work to do during those weeks but once it’s over, you walk away with the credits you need to get you where you need to be.”
Three summer sessions, each lasting six weeks, are offered from May 15 through August 25. According to the school website, “Classes are available during the morning, afternoon and evening from: 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.; 1:15 to 5:15 p.m.; and 5:30 to 9:30 p.m., and run Monday through Friday.” “Students can take up to six credits per summer session,” Montijo said. To enroll, students can contact their promise coach or academic advisor. If preferred, students can enroll online.

With less than three weeks until graduation, many seniors have mixed emotions. Graduation is a bittersweet moment that leaves many happy and others sad. Some students are excited for the future, and others are just not quite ready to leave.
As graduation approaches, students begin to think back to the very first day they walked onto campus. Life as a freshman is very different than that of a senior who will soon be job searching or going to graduate school.
Seniors are able to celebrate their last hurrah together during senior week. Together, friends can decorate their caps and or dance the night away at the senior formal. Finally, on May 5, the senior class will come together to receive their diplomas and celebrate the hard work they have put in the last four years.
What emotions are seniors feeling? Panagiotis Sacoulas, an information technology major, is both excited and sad. “I am sad because most of my friends are graduating and I won’t see them every day like I used to. I am also sad that I won’t be able to participate much in the activities I did as a student here,” Sacoulas said. Sacoulas is fortunate enough to be starting a full time job working for I.T. on campus once he graduates. “I am happy though because I am blessed to have gotten a job with the school, so I will be here continuing as member of the LIU family,” he said.
Klara Berggren, a senior public relations major, is excited to graduate. Berggren is from Sweden, but has extended her visa for an extra year to stay in the U.S. and work. Berggren plans to stay in New York for the summer and work at a soccer camp in the Hamptons. Then, Berggren will hopefully move to Los Angeles in the fall and get a job at a public relations agency or production company.. “I am beyond excited to graduate from Post in a month. I’ve probably had the best three years of my life here, but I am ready to see what the future holds, and I feel like I am more prepared than ever,” Berggren said.
Brittany Mitchell, a senior broadcasting major, also has mixed feelings about graduating. “Graduating is an amazing yet nerve-wracking feeling. There’s something beautiful about closing one chapter and starting a new one, but it’s still sort of scary stepping into the unknown,” Mitchell said. She is looking for a job and hopes to one day be an assistant producer or assistant writer, and then become a producer.
Seniors, you have little time left to make college memories. Make sure you make them count!

James Di Michele, a sophomore business administration manager, created his own clothing line, called KQ about three weeks ago. The name “KQ” comes from the king and queen cards in a standard deck of cards. The theme of the brand is playing cards, reflective of Di Michele’s affinity for poker. He started the business on his own as a result of a class project in his fashion merchandising class during fall 2016. “We had to create a clothing brand, and I created this not expecting it to be a real brand, but decided it was a cool idea.” After designing the logo and putting it on the first couple of products, Di Michele researched and found a website named Printful.com where the clothing could be made for him. “I just posted there, [employees] make it, and they ship it to the customers,” Di Michele explains. “They take a small fee but it is well worth it considering I do zero work and can focus on schoolwork, advertising, or designing more.” He sells mostly hats and tee shirts.
While he doesn’t make the clothing himself, Di Michele is in charge of every other element in running the business, “I do everything. I design it, I put it on the site, I fix all the issues, I designed the website; it’s all me.” The style is meant to be very universal and casual, and his target consumer base is mostly college students as well as anyone who genuinely enjoys card games as much as he does. “Poker is one of my favorite things to watch,” Di Michele said. Gambling for enjoyment was something he grew up with, so the concept of cards holds a special significance and serves as his inspiration towards developing his brand.
“The brand is only about two and a half, three weeks old,” Di Michele said. His costumers have been mostly friends so far. He gains a profit from all of his sales, and so far, the amount he’s earned just about matches the manufacturing costs. Di Michele hopes to grow the business substantially so that by his graduation, it will be a well-known brand. “Right now, it’s more like a startup.” Currently, 13 products are available for purchase on his website, KQApparel.com.
“There aren’t a lot of dedicated card game clothing brands, and the ones that do exist mainly are those that run online casinos,” he explained. These products are more advertisements than independent clothing lines, so Di Michele hopes to be one of the first to create a brand that adheres strictly to the concept. Eventually, he wants to expand his business into retail stores. “I have no training in fashion design. It is just something I am passionate in, two of my favorite things are clothes and art,” Di Michele said. He began with painting on plain white sneakers.
Di Michele’s advice for people looking to start their own clothing line is to, “Start with a theme. Have all of the products be tied together in some way. And then once you have a good customer-base with that theme, expand into something else.” All of his designs reflect the logo he has created through the colors red, black, and white. He explained, “It makes the brand more recognizable.”

With finals week approaching, homework starts piling up, assignments increase, and students go to the library to study intensely. What makes finals week special is that it is the crescendo leading up to the climax right before school ends and is the only thing separating students from summer. But how will students deal with finals week? How will they cope with homework and assignments, and can they handle it?
The general consensus is that students are able to handle finals week and all that it entails. Senior English major, Erika Parks said, “I think I’ll be able to handle it pretty well. I’ve gone through [the process] a bunch of times. So I’m used to it.”
For seniors who have been through the finals week process it may be easy, but for some freshmen it can be more of a struggle. Cara Kennedy, a freshman pathology major said, “It’s going to be really hard, so I’m just gonna go to the library and study a lot.”
In addition, some suggest taking breaks when needed. Taking breaks allows you to relax your mind and take a breather. “[I’ll] probably study hard and try to take a break when I can,” said freshman, music education major, Amanda Avdoulous.
Another way of handling finals is to set aside time to study and plan accordingly. “Make sure you set aside ample time to review any material you have to, and that way you’ll stress out less,” said Burcu Altintas, a senior psychology major. Keeping a planner or putting reminders in your phone is a good way to keep yourself organized so that you can plan out your study time and outside activities.
The common thread in all these student opinions is an emphasis on studying and a confidence that they can handle it. This finals week can be handled with a lot of studying, some breaks in between, and organization.

Music department faculty members Susan Deaver, Dale Stuckenbruck, Veronica Salas, Maureen Hynes and Heawon Kim, who make up the Pierrot Consort Chamber will perform on Thursday, Apr. 13 inside the Great Hall at 8:15 p.m. The performance will mark the 31st anniversary of the group’s.
“The Pierrot Consort gives a series of concerts each year – two during the school year and during the LIU Post Chamber music festival in July where we are all the main faculty members,” Susan Deaver, an adjunct music professor said. The group will be playing chamber music by German Baroque composer, Telemann, and French opera composer Delibes among many other classic pieces, Deaver said. The members of the group collaborate together to decide what pieces to perform. Once the members of the ensemble “suggest repertoire” the group starts rehearsing the works. Deaver’s favorite part about the group boils down to the bare essentials of the music. “Performing together and playing chamber music.”
The consort was formed in 1981 “originally modeled after the instrumentation of Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire and has always been dedicated to performing new music as well as the standard repertoire,” according to the university website The Chamber group has performed in many places along the east coast, including the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut and the Stockbridge Chamber Concerts in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Admission is free for all to attend.

The LIU Post chorus and chamber singers are performing in their last concert of the semester at the Interfaith Center on campus on April 14 at 8 p.m. The chorus will sing a number of pieces, starting with Six Nocturnes by W.A. Mozart. “This beautifully expressive cycle, sung in Italian, covers the gamut of interpersonal human emotion in typically Mozartian fashion,” Marc Shapiro, director of choral studies and associate professor of music, said.
The chorus will also perform three German songs from the 19 century, Belsazar by Robert Schumann, Erlkonig by Carl Loewe, In der Nacht by Johannes Brahms. “The first two of these songs are “story songs,” meaning they are extremely dramatic, or frightening,” Shapiro said.
The first song, Belsazar tells the tale of a hubristic ruler whose overcon dence and greed lead to his downfall and death; Erlkonig is a famous German narrative involving a “child-catcher.” Brahms’s In der Nacht is a soulful nighttime meditation on life’s meaning and purpose.” The chorus will end with a spiritual Plenty Good Room. Shapiro decided to end with this piece [because] “this spiritual has such an inclusive and hopeful message, and musically it is a rouser!”
The Chamber Singers will sing excerpts from a cycle called “From an Unknown Past,” by the American composer Ned Rorem; and two groups of English “Glees,” which are the 18-19 century equivalents of community music-making,
“The Chorus is larger than the Chamber Singers, and its repertoire tends toward larger-scale works for chorus and instruments that enable them to collaborate with The Cecilia Chorus of New York at Carnegie Hall and The Tilles Center. The Chamber Singers have a different repertoire focus. Many students participate in both groups. They find the experience is important to their musical and personal growth,” Shapiro said.
The show will also present a number of “coffee house” acts. Individual students will present current work, including art songs by the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla, music for marimba, and a variety of contemporary pieces.
Veronica Nguyen, a junior vocal performance major, who participates in both groups has been practicing for the performance since the beginning of the semester. Nguyen is most excited for the “coffee house” performances because they show a variety of different acts that really showcase students work outside of singing. “I encourage students to attend because if you don’t know about this kind of music, it’s a good way to get exposed to it,” Nguyen added.
Tickets are $10, $8 for seniors. Admission is free for Post students with I.D. Both ensembles are open by audition to any member of the LIU Post Community: any student, faculty member, administrator, or other worker. Anyone who may be interested in joining can email director Marc Shapiro at mark.shapiro@liu.edu.

After an impressive showing at the Roadrunner Invitational, freshman distance runner Jeffrey Reyes was named East Coast Conference’s Men’s Track Athlete of the Week April 4.
Reyes, a pre-med major, won the 800 and 1,500-meter run, crossing the finish line at 1:59.72 and 4:07.58, respectively, while also running the third leg of the 4×400 team that finished in third.
Earlier in the year, during the indoor track season, Reyes exceeded everyone’s expectations when he captured the East Coast Conference title in the 1,000-meter run while still recovering from a pulled hamstring. Reyes said he pulled his hamstring in his right leg, and also hurt his right knee, in December while working out.
Reyes said that overworking himself something that he has to work on. “Coach Buckley always encourages me to run faster, run better, but also not do too much because I’m the type of person who likes to work out a lot,” Reyes said, referring to Kevin Buckley head coach of all running teams at LIU Post.
Buckley, who is in his first year as head coach at Post, was the one who recruited Reyes from Bay Shore High School last year. “I didn’t know where to go, and Buckley just came out of nowhere and convinced me to come here,” Reyes said.
Reyes actually started his athletic career with football, only running competitively to gain speed for football. It was his sister Jasmin, who is just 10 months older than Jeffrey and a freshman on the University of Buffalo cross country and track and field teams, who introduced him to competitive running. After a successful winter and spring track season during his freshman year of high school, Reyes dropped football after his to focus on running full time. Some of his accomplishments during his four years at Bay Shore include: league champions three years in a row in spring track, qualifying for States his senior year in the 1,000-meter run, and also qualifying for nationals during his freshman and senior year in the 1,600-meter run and spring medley relay.
Reyes has continued his success in all three competitive running sports for the Pioneers: indoor track and field, outdoor track and field and cross country. He has actually cut his times during his first year on campus, and he credits Buckley for his continued success. “He’s always telling me less is more,” Reyes said. “When I’m feeling down, he’s always bringing me up and pushing me.”
Stefan Adams, a senior runner for the Pioneers, said that although Reyes has performed well, he knows he can still do better. “He works hard, probably harder than anyone else on the team,” Adams said.
As for his next three years at Post, Reyes said he hopes to eventually qualify and win nationals, as long as he can stay healthy.

The baseball team welcomed East Coast Conference rival University of Bridgeport for a twin bill on Saturday, March 8 at the LIU Post Baseball Field. The Pioneers fell 12-3 in the first game, but bounced back in the second game with a 2-1 victory to salvage a split.
In the first game, sophomore pitcher James Varela took the hill for the Pioneers and held Bridgeport to only one run through the first three innings, but ran into trouble in the top of the fourth inning. A walk, single, and error loaded the bases with nobody out, and Varela would yield a two-RBI single to the next batter. He was able to limit the damage, though, only allowing one more run in the inning, but Bridgeport led 4-0.
The Pioneers found themselves down 5-0 by the bottom of the fifth. After junior shortstop Joe Spitaleri scored on a wild pitch, senior outfielder Kenny Daley followed with an RBI triple to score junior outfielder Rob Andreoli, and Daley would later score on a wild pitch of his own. The Pioneers scored three runs in that inning to close the gap to 5-3.
But the game got away from the Pioneers later, as Bridgeport added three runs in the eighth and four more in the ninth to blow the game open to 12-3, putting it completely out of reach.
Things were much better for the home team in the second game, though. “We just needed to completely forget that first game and focus on the next game,” said junior shortstop Joe Spitaleri. The Pioneers’ offense struck early when Daley singled home a run in the first inning. The home team would strike again in the bottom of the fourth, as sophomore infielder Sal Geraci singled home another run and put the Pioneers up 2-0.
That would be all the Pioneers needed behind sophomore pitcher Brian Kavanagh, who was making his first appearance of the season after missing the first month with a minor arm injury. He pitched 6.1 brilliant innings, stifling Bridgeport and not allowing a run until the seventh inning.
“He was very impressive but that’s what we expect out of him,” said Spitaleri. “He’s a work-horse and we knew how badly he needed to be back there.”
A walk, two wild pitches, and an RBI single in that seventh inning were what ended Kavanagh’s day. Senior relief pitcher came in afterward and shut the door, getting a ground ball double play to end the game, which only went seven innings.
“The conference games are very important,” said sophomore in fielder Jimmy Mendyk. “We want to win early on to gain some ground in the standings and gain some momentum.”
The split put the Pioneers at 13-12 on the season, and 4-3 in the ECC. The Pioneers’ next home game comes in a non-conference tilt on Wednesday, April 12 against East Stroudsburg University.
