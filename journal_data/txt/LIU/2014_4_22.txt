Dear Professor Drastal,
We have received the letter that you sent to Pete Barell, the Pioneer’s Arts & Entertainment editor. We are thrilled that you are reading the Pioneer and took the time to contact us. Our writers, photographers, editors, copyeditors, layout editors, and other staff put so much work into every single issue, as we know your students do into your productions.
The writers are given the opportunity to write for all sections of the paper. So, for example, a writer may cover news one week, arts the next, and sports the next. Writers are not assigned to write reviews every week, even if they prefer to cover the arts, because the Pioneer is a training ground and launching pad for future journalists. They get real experience in all areas of the publication, which helps them get jobs upon graduation. Our section editors work hard with the writers to make sure that all stories are fair, balanced, and properly reported. Of course, there are times when there is disappointment with a story, from readers like you, and from us as well.
However, we are all students, and constantly learning and working to improve. As for not covering the Theater Department in the future, we are sure that, as a creator like us, you value the free speech rights of the Pioneer as much as we value your rights to create.
Thank you for your constructive criticism. We will share it with all of our writers and editors, and hopefully they will all benefit from it.
Sincerely,
Dorianna Valerio Editor-in-Chief, The Pioneer

Hey all,
I am very sorry for the disappointment. While our writers are entitled to their own opinion, we constantly provide feedback to be more specific and constructive. Unfortunately we were not able to have a particularly theater savvy writer attend the event. But he was the only one who was available, and this was much wanted coverage.
The feedback we sent him was fulfilled to a degree, but since we are short of staff (especially for this section) I felt we could not cut the piece altogether. Sometimes I do large rewrites for pieces, and I always try to work extensively with the writers. On this occasion we were not able to do as comprehensive rewriting as usual, being a weekend event (our usual first draft deadline is Thursday) and because I was distracted with another commitment this weekend. But I know this is no an excuse.
As you know, we are student newspaper, having a wide variety of writers of varying skills and knowledge. We try our best to be consistent, but sometimes we are not.  We are constantly learning and trying to improve.
I will keep in mind these shortfalls in reviewing. Next semester I will have an assistant, so we will have a much better peer review system. We will also try to cover rehearsals and behind-the-scenes more closely. After all, these are students and we want them to succeed. We will avoid compromises of writer selection, and of peer review and feedback in the future. As a student, I have taken this lesson and take responsibility.
I hope we can continue our relationship.
Best,
Peter Barell

Hi Pete,
I just read Michael’s article about the First year Showcase in The Pioneer, and frankly, I was surprised. While I appreciate you sending a writer to attend, may I ask if he is an arts writer? Does he have any background in or experience with theatre at all? The piece struck me as a nod to people he knows or is friends with, lacking any real substance. It was not well-structured and many of the claims, both positive and negative, lacked validity.
If Michael had spoken with anyone involved or done any research he would know that the “filler” scene was actually a demonstration of the department training, a method of acting which is movement-based training that is unique to the LIU Post undergrad program. This “filler” is, indeed what will set these actors apart when they work professionally.
Additionally, if he knew anything at all about the space and theatrical acoustics, he would understand that it is completely inappropriate and impossible to mic the actors in this space without creating so much feedback that it would make the show unbearable. Criticism regarding actor’s articulation and projection would be appropriate. Criticism linking tuition rates with the lack of microphones used in the production is not.
Any time that a writer from the Pioneer has covered our shows in the past, they have attended a rehearsal and spoken with people from the company about the structure and the process in an effort to better understand context. I welcome any criticism grounded in an understanding of the creative process through articulate and thoughtful writing. This piece, however, was poorly structured and not well thought out, lacking any realcoherent throughline. if this is the sort of piece you’re planning to publish about our work in the future, please don’t bother. I am happy to talk with you further about this, if you so desire.
Best,
Heather Drastal
General Manager, Post Theatre Company
