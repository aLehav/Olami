It may not be football season just yet, but there is plenty of action going on at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. While the New York Jets are working on putting together its 2014 roster, the Flight Crew (the Jets’ dance and cheer team) is hosting auditions for this season’s cheerleading team. Kirstin McDonough, a senior Health Science major and a four-year member of the LIU Post Dance Team, is now in the final round of auditions with hopes as high as her kicks.
The Jets’ Flight Crew auditions consist of three rounds: preliminaries, semi-finals and finals. Saturday, March 29, and Sunday, March 30, marked the beginning of the tryout process. Cuts were made each day in order to find the 40 girls who will be inducted into this year’s Flight Crew. 200 girls auditioned. Of them, 102 made it to the semi-finals, and only 63 made it to the final round, which will take place on Thursday, April 10.
McDonough is one of the 63 contestants headed to the finals. McDonough tried out for the crew last year, but was cut in the semi- finals round. She used last year’s cut as motivation to work even harder this year. “The biggest struggle with preparing for auditions is time management. I have to balance school, dance, work, and being able to train and work out. It isn’t easy,” McDonough said.
“Tryouts went great this year,” she added. “I attended one of the three prep classes offered before tryouts and received a boarding pass.” The boarding pass enabled McDonough to skip the preliminary round and go directly to the semi-finals. “Being able to skip that was a relief, but [it] meant I was [entering a] harder competition,” she said.
Auditions for semi-finals were held on Sunday, March 30, in the Lexus Club at MetLife Stadium. The day began with a brief introduction, followed by a choreographed routine the participants would perform for the judges later on. After learning the choreography, the cheerleaders were given plenty of time to rehearse and get ready to perform.
“I’m really excited about this group. I’m probably more excited about this group of finalists than I have been in a while,” said Denise Garvey, the director of Flight Crew, in a recent interview with a Jets spokesperson.
“They’re always tough because you know how badly people want to be a part of the team,” Garvey added. “It’s always hard, and you just hope that they can use it as a learning experience, and if they really want it, they’ll grow and develop…as…performer[s] and come back [stronger next year].”
McDonough did just that. “It was hard to walk in feeling confident after last year’s auditions, but I’ve trained 10 times harder, and I know that I have what it takes. It feels so incredible and wonderful to see my hard work finally pay off,” McDonough said. “I feel thankful knowing that I made it to finals, but I know that the competition isn’t over just yet.”
On April 10, McDonough will perform the routines that were taught at the semis, as well as a 90-second solo in which she will showcase her own style of dance for the judges.
“She really deserves it; she is always training and working so hard. I know if she makes it onto the team, she will be a great teammate and asset [to] the Crew,” said Ashley Munford, a junior Education major and member of the LIU Post Dance Team.
“I know she has what it takes. She has the look, the body, the strength, the skills, and the showmanship,” said Alyssa Clarkin, an alumni LIU Post Dance Team member and close friend of McDonough. “I believe that Kirstin will make it through the final round with no trouble at all, and if she doesn’t, I know that she will work even harder for next year’s auditions; nothing will stop her.”
“I feel like it’s anybody’s game,” said Garvey about the competition. “We have a lot of retiring cheerleaders, but that doesn’t mean that anybody is safe.”
“I’m genuinely excited for finals; I really think I have a good chance of making the team,” McDonough said. Her journey to become a Jet Flight Crew member began a year ago and now it all has come down to one final round.

The Commuter Student Association (CSA) held its first Commuter Appreciation Week, on Monday, March 24. The CSA is a club that helps commuters get involved and form lasting friendships at LIU Post. The club holds events on and off campus.
CSA decided to sponsor Commuter Appreciation Week because “it is important that commuters feel like a part of the LIU Post community, just as every student should feel,” said Rita Iosefson, CSA president and a senior Education major. “We want to make students aware that the commuter population is significant at our school, and we are hoping that Commuter Appreciation Week makes these students feel recognized,” she added.
There are about 4,000 undergraduate stu- dents at Post. More than 80 percent of these students are commuters, according to Student Life.
“Since the commuter student population is so prominent, it is important that they feel just as at home as the resident students do,” said Erik Arnesen, CSA Special Events co-chair and a junior Education major. “I often hear commuters saying that there is nothing for them to do around campus, so this week is made especially for them.”
The CSA is one of the five largest clubs on campus, having over 150 students on their mailing list and about 5o members that attend their weekly meetings.
The CSA along with advisor Jamie Dresher of Student Life Leadership and Development created a six-day schedule of events on and off campus for all students to participate in.
The week began with “Make Your Mark on Long Island,” an event that allowed students to mark the location of their hometown on a map of Long Island. The map was drawn on Hillwood’s Fishbowl windows. Over 100 students participated in the event, leaving the windows full of color and marked with over 20 towns.
The week of events continued with an American Automobiles Association (AAA) Driving Emergencies workshop at 12:45 in the Gold Coast Cinema. Students were informed on what to do incase of a vehicle emergency, and a representative from AAA spoke to about 15 students in attendance.
There was also a Carpooling Information Table set up during common hour and an Ice Cream Social event on Wednesday. Both events took place in the Hillwood Lobby.
The week came to an end with the “Commuter Hot Cocoa” event, which was held in the Hillwood Courtyard at 8:30 a.m. There was also a laser tag trip that attracted more than 15 students who got transporta- tion and two hours of laser tag for the price of $10. “All the students who attended had a great time, and we would love to include this event again next year,” said Nicole Cunningham, CSA’s Public Relations chair and a senior Education major.
There was also the weekly CSA Trivia with Twice as Nice at 8 p.m., on Friday in the End Zone, and afterward, Disney’s “Frozen” played in the Gold Coast Cinema. The 2013 film brought in big crowds, and students were offered free nachos, hot dogs, churros and French fries.
On the last day of Commuter Appreciation Week, CSA organized its eighth “Bowling for A Cause” event at Syosset Lanes with the Circle K club. The event was open to all students and their families, and more than 50 people attended. Students were able to enter to win raffles and other prizes. Each year, CSA donates the money raised at its bowling event to a new cause. This year, the proceeds were donated to the Elimi- nate Project, which is an organization run by Kiwanis International and UNICEF to reduce maternal and neonatal tetanus. When the night was over, CSA had raised $570.
“We are thrilled that so many students came out to our weekend events,” Iosefson said. “The turnout has been great. As an e-board, we have worked incredibly hard all semester to make this week great, and it all depended on the support we got from the campus community,” she added. CSA now plans to turn the Commuter Appreciation Week into a tradition.

LIU Post will host the fourth annual “Many Faces of Family Violence” conference on April 11, from 8:15 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., in Hillwood Commons. The conference is free and open to the public, and will focus on child trafficking and the impact on the victims’ families.
Human trafficking occurs in places all over the world, including the Unites States.
A 2011 report by the U.S. State Department, titled “Trafficking in Persons Report,” calculated that 27 million men, women and children are victims of human trafficking. Approximately 41 percent of sex trafficking victims and 20 percent of labor trafficking victims are American citizens, according to the Polaris Project, a non-profit, non-governmental agency that works to combat and prevent human trafficking.
Human trafficking can be described as modern day slavery. It involves the controlling and exploiting of human beings for profit. Victims of human trafficking are trapped physically, psychologically, financially, or emotionally by their traffickers and are seldom granted their freedom.
Women have been discovered as domestic workers in homes in Maryland and New York, and human trafficking victims have also been found working in restaurants, hotels, nail salons, and shops in both small towns and large cities.
“Human trafficking and the international sex trade encompass issues that violate the basic principles of social justice and human dignity,” said Dr. John Imhof, commissioner of Nassau County Department of Social Services and adjunct professor of Social Work at Post, as he explained the relationship between social work and human trafficking issues.
“Since the social work profession is committed to poverty reduction, empowering vulnerable populations, and eliminating gender-based oppression, it is essential for social work practitioners to be knowledgeable about global sex trafficking from both global and specific [local] perspectives,” he added.
“The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) has issued several policy statements on human rights, refugees, child welfare, and cultural competence which all speak to the issue of human trafficking,” Imhof said. “Furthermore, NASW promotes a professional mission of enhancing human well-being and devoting particular attention to the needs and empowerment of people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty; [these people] largely represent the population of human trafficking victims,” he added.
“Human trafficking is a worldwide epidemic, especially affecting women and children living in countries facing serious issues with poverty and malnutrition,” Imhof continued. “However, human trafficking and sexual exploitation also flourish in those countries that historically have had little regard for the basic human rights of women and children, and an absence of laws and punishments against human trafficking permits human trafficking to flourish out of control.”
Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano’s Task Force on Family Violence, the Social Work Department, and the School of Health Professions and Nursing at LIU Post will host the “Many Faces of Family Violence” conference.

The International Student Union (ISU), a multicultural organization that aims to foster growth and inclusion of the entire international student population at Post, presented a “Tastes of the World” demonstration in the lobby of Hillwood Commons during common hour, on Wednesday, April 2.
“Tastes of the World,” gave Post students the opportunity to experience different world cultures from the perspective of international students. The demonstration was part of a series of events for International Student Recognition Week. Students from India, Japan, China, Korea, Sweden, Norway, and Taiwan cooked signature dishes from their respec- tive countries for everyone to try.
A table in the lobby featured dishes ranging from Taiwanese bubble tea to Swedish cinnamon buns. About 50 or so students attended the free event, and a few faculty members also stopped by to try a bite.
The food offered at “Tastes of the World” included: Taiwanese sausage, kokosbollar, haw flakes, White Rabbit creamy candy, chocolate-coated biscuits, soft flour raisin cake, vegetable biscuits, silang green onion thin cracker, white heimm, strawberry French pie, Gen Je pie, kameda potapota yaki (rice cracker), onidako (kameda rice cracker), samosas, and Gulab jamun.
“I think it is a great way for students to experience different cultures; food is the best way to do this,” said Kiren Mykoo, a senior History/ Political Science major from India.
“I am happy that a lot of Americans are interested in different countries, and that my American friends can experience Korean culture,” said Nomi Park, a freshman Health Science major from Korea.
Vibeke Aarstad, a senior Accounting major from Sweden, agreed. “I think it is a great experience for the stomach; it also educates our fellow students about our cultures,” she said.
Tomoko Motoyama, a freshman Public Relations major from Japan said that she was excited to “represent her country,” and that “everyone was able to get a taste of Japanese culture.”
An international fashion show was also held as part of the International Student Recognition Week.

Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE), a fraternity waiting for official national recognition as a legitimate chapter, held a fundraiser on March 26 at The End Zone, in Hillwood Commons. Approximately 50 students attended the event, which raised money for Relay for Life, a 12-hour, overnight event that aims to raise money and awareness for cancer research.
From 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., students were entertained by live music provided by fellow students. Eric Simonson, a junior Marketing major and fundraising chair for TKE, was pleased with the attendance.
With its stage and a PA system, the sports bar allowed students to bring their own instruments and amplifiers to perform in front of the audience. The six student acts ranged from acoustic sets to duet covers. “I’m doing all originals and covers tonight,” said Daniel DeMarco, a sophomore Biology major, as he prepared for his solo acoustic set.
Daniel Shinn, a senior Computer Science major and TKE member, announced all the performers before they arrived on stage and even provided his own parodied a cappella version of Drake’s hit song, “Hold on We’re Going Home.”
Raffles also took place, which included prizes such as four passes to Adventureland and two tickets to see “Bring It On,” courtesy of the Tilles Center. All the proceeds went to Relay for Life.
Post will host its first Relay for Life event on April 25, on the Great Lawn, beginning at 5 p.m.
The raffle, according to members of TKE, did not raise a lot of money. When asked why, the members were not able to comment. However, Joey Figueroa, a senior Psychology major and president of TKE, claimed that the event was a success in other ways. “I would definitely call it a successful program in terms of publicity.”
According to TKE.org, Tau Kappa Epsilon was founded in 1989 at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Illinois. The international fraternity has over 270 active chapters and colonies located throughout the United States and Canada. When it receives official recognition, it will become LIU Post’s sixth fraternity on campus, joining Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha Psi, Lambda Sigma Upsilon, Lambda Upsilon Lambda, and Phi Iota Alpha.
In its Feb. 25 issue, The Pioneer reported that Theta Chi was still only a colony and it remains as such. Like Theta Chi, TKE is on its way to becoming a nationally recognized chapter. In order for students to create a specific Greek chapter at Post, Student Life and Leadership Development must approve it.
“I’d like to thank everyone who came out and supported not only us, but Relay for Life. I think we had a really great and successful night. We look forward to putting on more events that people can come and enjoy,” Simonson said.

The spring semester comes to a close in less than a month. With finals, assignments, and papers due, this is the time when most students stress out. For those who never got back into the swing of things after a snowy start to the semester, here are some tips to help you prepare for the final weeks of classes.
The first and most important thing students must do is to prioritize their commitments. Students will have an easier time studying by making extra time for it, and should put off any unnecessary social obligations, and trim their work schedules. A few strategically placed extra hours can make the difference between doing “okay” on finals and doing “fantastic.”
Some students have that one class, or multiple classes, where the final is based on the readings that he or she has never read. Remember that book you purchased two months ago that is collecting dust? Start reading it now. By reading the material early, students can become more familiar with the content over the next few weeks, and will not have to cram and cry the night before an exam. Start by reading a couple of chapters per week, and split the chapters up into sections. Highlight what you don’t know so you can focus on that material.
Papers are not always fun to write, and sometimes can take a lot of time to complete. For students who need help with research, grammar, or anything else, seek help in the LIU Post’s Writing Center. They work one-on-one to help develop essays by brainstorming, planning, editing, and revising.
The Writing Center is located in Humanities Hall, Room 202 and is open Monday through Thursday from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and on Fridays from 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
Students can contact the Writing Center at (516) 299-2732 and through email at Post-WC@liu.edu.
“I have gone to the Writing Center multiple times this semester to work on my English essays,” said Ryan Kelly, a senior Business Administration major. “I’m more of a math guy, so writing is not my strong point, but working on my essay with someone else helped me get an A and finish the assignment quickly.”
During finals week, the library, or any quiet place where students can focus on schoolwork, is a great resource. “I live in the library towards the end of the semester,” said Ashley Parker, a junior Psychology major. “With all the work I have, I need to be in a space that has no distractions in order to study.”
Students have many different techniques and tricks to help them prepare for finals week.
“My best study tip would be to highlight in different colors so that your notes are organized,” said Brittney Cataldo, a senior Early Childhood Education major. “I also make flashcards to help remember terms, and before I even begin studying, I make a list of the material that I want to go over and wh[en] I will study it, so I won’t spend too much time on the same [material].”
Exams begin on May 2, so students can alleviate the stress by starting to plan now. Organization, planning, and good time management can take away much of the stress of the dreaded finals week.

With graduation only a few weeks away, Roni Badrian, the as- sistant director of Career Development Services, provides students with tips on acing an interview. “The interview starts once your resume is out,” Badrian said. In order to prepare for the interview, Badrian advised candidates to follow these steps:
1) Research the company. Make sure to be knowledgeable about ma- jor aspects about the position.
2) Know how to get there prior to the interview and who will be interviewing you.
3) Dress to impress. Men should wear a suit or dress pants, a blazer, a button-down, and a tie. Women should wear a suit or dress pants, or a long skirt and minimal accessories, and should carry a small clutch/bag – no big purses. Women are also advised to have tidy nails.
4) On the day of the interview, get there 10 to 15 minutes early. Bring a pen, copies of your resume, a list of credible references, and educa- tion transcripts.
5) Make sure you cellphone is off — not on silent or vibrate.
6) Be friendly. Make sure to smile and say hello.
7) During the interview, show confidence, personality, and enthusi- asm and make sure to have a firm handshake, keep eye contact, pay attention, and listen carefully.
8) Speak slowly and clearly, and pause if you need to collect your thoughts. Avoid saying, “um.” Also, remember to maintain a profes- sional posture — do not slouch.
“An employer will probably ask you questions regarding situa- tions where you showed signs of teamwork, leadership, or relationship building skills. Make sure to have an appropriate answer,” Badrian said. Badrian also suggested asking “at least one or two questions at the end of the interview. It will show that you are engaged. When closing, a good question to ask would be: ‘When can I be expected to hear from you?’” she said.
“I think it is important not to be intimidated when applying for jobs or going on interviews,” said Kevin O’Lear, a junior Broadcasting major. “Go with an open mind and a positive attitude; it will help you feel more confident and less nervous,” he added.
“Being prepared is key. If you come unprepared, it shows, and your chances of being hired are diminished,” said Rebecca Young, a sophomore Business Management major.
“There are so many people applying for jobs, and even if you don’t seem original, you might still have a chance of getting the job if there are many positions open. However, if you appear to be disorga- nized or ignorant and if you are late, you won’t get the job, no matter how many slots are open,” Young added.
LIU Post Career Services is located in Kumble Hall on the sec- ond floor in room 200. For more information, contact Badrian at roni. badrian@liu.edu.

At LIU Post, there are separate floors for male and female students, and co-ed living is not permitted in dorm rooms. Co-ed living allows men and women to dorm together.
According to a 2009 USA Today article, titled “Colleges are Allowing Co-Ed Dorms,” over two dozen colleges across the United States allow students of the opposite sex to dorm together.
Some students insist that they should be allowed to room together regardless of gender. Although some colleges in the US have permitted co-ed rooming, many parents, students, and officials assert that the traditional policy is necessary to regulate student behavior.
Will co-ed living be enabled at LIU Post one day? What about co-ed floors?
“Based on our physical layouts (bathrooms) we are limited in options. If suites become available, this would allow us to further explore co-ed living,” said Jessica Hayes, associate dean of Students and LIU Promise.
“We share the same interests, go to bed at the same time, and have similar study habits,” said Tyler Malloy, a freshman Biology major. “But the only difference between me and my best friend is that we are different gender[s]. Co-ed floors should be permitted. I have a ton of friends who are girls.
Sometimes a male and female friendship is less likely to cause drama.” Shantel Graham, a senior International Studies/Business
Administration major, opposes co-ed dorming. “This is my fourth year living on campus and I have enjoyed my privacy. Personally, I think girls and boys floors and rooms should be kept separate,” Graham said LGBT rights advocates say that traditional housing arrangements, which require that roommates identify as the same gender, are antiquated and unfair. 
“When my mom went to Ithaca College there were co-ed rooms and floors. If it were up to me, I would enable co-ed dorms. My mom had a great college experience, and co-ed living allowed her to establish better relationships with the people in her building and on her floor. It is important to be able to interact with all people regardless of gender, race, or any other stereotype” said Jennifer Shepardson, a junior Broadcasting major.
Although LIU Post has not closed the book on co-ed living; more and more colleges across the US are permitting co-ed rooming, including Cornell, Ithaca College, Columbia University, Fashion
Insitute of Technology, New York University, Stanford University, The University of Michigan, Dartmouth, Brown University, The University of Pennsylvania, Oberlin College, Clark University, and California Institute of Technology.

Procrastination – as college students, we know what it is and we all claim to be victims of it. Although some might think of it as a virus, this unorthodox way of life doesn’t seem to deter others. I’m fairly certain that the majority of students here at LIU Post, as well across the nation, would certify themselves as masters in the field. Procrastination is doing and not doing certain things needed to accomplish a task at hand.
So why does procrastination happen? 
Well, because we let the power of persuasion take over our minds, convincing us to think about or do anything other than the work that is due. Even the less hygienic students among us would more than willingly jump in the shower, and the more sedentary students would decide to go for a spontaneous run to avoid the horrific feeling of being drowned by a task that he or she has already been putting off.
I’d be lying if I said that I don’t do it myself. As a matter of fact, I did my fair share before writing this article — thanks to Chris Brown, I’ve become hooked on his new “Loyal” music video, featuring Tyga and Lil’ Wayne. So much that I’ve resorted to repeatedly watching it online, fantasizing about being one of the extremely lucky backup dancers. But back to reality, which sadly for most of us, is procrastination. You might even be reading this article in a procrastination-induced state.
I believe that procrastination varies for every individual; what one might consider procrastinating, another might not. Two Post students exemplify the difference.
According to Meghan Brazier, a sophomore International Business major, procrastinating is normal for college students,
yet it varies depending on the person. “I’m one of the people who procrastinate a lot. I’ll do anything besides work; catch up on television shows, browse all sorts of social media, and hang out with friends.”
Courtney Delehanty, a junior Health Administration major, attempts to fight the battle of procrastination. However, she is aware
of the reason why her procrastination arises. “I will find myself procrastinating when I’m struggling with an assignment, so then I’ll take a small break, because when I go back to my work I tell myself that I’ll be able to figure it out, even if I don’t,” she said.
“My problem is that the small break is never as small as it’s meant to be.” At least for Delehanty, the intention is positive and productive.
“I do try to get things done but I will procrastinate when I know the work isn’t due soon. If it’s crunch time, I’ll procrastinate until then by visiting my lovely neighbors. Also, I find myself doing more reading assignments after I procrastinate, because I need to feel like I’ve done something somewhat useful,” Delehanty added.
Brazier and Delehanty are only two students among many that actively or unintentionally procrastinate.
But is there a cure to this time-consuming “activity?” I encourage you not to procrastinate your life away, because who knows what benefits may arise from keeping yourself motivated and being able to master time-management? Amid the most important period of our lives as college students, our future is in our hands, so why should we waste it? Limit your procrastination time and discipline yourself.

The International Students Union (ISU) hosted a Karaoke Night at The End Zone, in Hillwood Commons, on Tuesday, March
31.
Approximately 30 people attended the 8 p.m. event. A majority of the participants were Post international students, singing in their own language. The event aimed to promote world culture and unity, with music as a way to connect people from different countries. This year marks the first time the event was held, but more are considered for the future, according to Alanna Hynes-Gur, vice president of ISU.
Lei Zhang, a graduate Accounting major, sang a popular Chinese song called “Zuo Bien” by the female singer Duong Thau. “I chose ‘Zuo Bien’ because it is very popular among the Chinese,” said Zhang. “I was the first one to sing, so I also wanted to cheer up everyone by singing a popular song.” The song means “Left Side” in Chinese. According to Zhang, the song is about how the heart is on the left side of the body, and how girls try not to let boys hear their heart beats. It is a soft and slow love song.
Other students sang songs from other countries. Kevin O’Lear, a sophomore Broadcasting major, sung his favorite Japanese song “Pon Pon Pon” by Krary Pamyu Pamyu, with another student from Japan. O’Lear found the song on the blogging site, Tumblr. Alexander Benjamin Conley, a freshman Music major, sang a song by Stevie Wonder. “I sang [Wonder’s] ‘I Just Called to Say I Love You’ because I really love Stevie and it’s such a nice song,” Conley said.
ISU made use of The End Zone by utilizing the elevated stage, big televisions, and microphones. Students who were eating dinner at The End Zone also joined in on the karaoke. The event was a way for American and international students to get to know each other in a fun setting.

Leon Reid IV has come a long way from being a typical graffiti artist kid to a professional public artist. He tries to keep comedy in his work, and his work affects the people fortunate enough to see it.
Reid’s upcoming project is a collaboration with Ryan Seslow, who has been teaching students about graffiti and street art at Post for three years. The artists will start a year-long public art project during the fall 2014 semester, which is part of the Public Art Festival organized by the Art department every year.

The two artists plan on creating an excavation site, where outdated technology such as old computers and music devices will be displayed as artifacts; showing how quickly technology changes and becomes useless. This project is open to all LIU post students who wish to participate in the process, as well as see how public artists work, and what their procedures are. In January 2015, they will present a Street Art and Graffiti show at the Steinberg Museum of Art.
Reid has gone by three different names throughout his life: “Verbs,” “Darius Jones,” and currently, his real name, Leon Reid IV. One might wonder why all the names and all of the changes. Reid is a street artist, also known as a public artist. The reason for having different names was to distinguish his different style shifts throughout his artistic career.
“Verbs” was used during the beginning of Reid’s career, after he saw the word on the shirt of a stranger. When he was about 15-years- old, he started his graffiti with friends, allowing him to explore his individuality, while simultaneously being part of a group – an important part of adolescence. Living in Cincinnati, the group would wait for trains to pass by in the train yard and tag their names on them, hoping they would be seen in different states, like New York.
One of his friends was more into the art than the words, and this sensibility influenced Reid in addition to the influence of his first girlfriend. This change in views birthed the alias, “Darius Jones.”
“Darius Jones” was more about the content, not the name; this was his entry into his street art phase, deviating from his earlier graffiti style. A lot of the new pieces were interactive and inspired by their locations. One of his works was in view of a very busy bridge, reading, “Honk if you love graffiti,” which many people obliged. The metal shop at the Pratt Institute, where the artist studied, allowed him to learn new techniques he later applied to his street art.
Jones and his friends learned that if they put on a hard hat, an orange reflective vest, and carried around a cordless hammer-drill, they could get away with installing almost everything during the day. In his flower series, Jones had flowers growing from concrete. This series was inspired by his amazement of how something as soft as grass could penetrate concrete.
In Britain, Jones and his friends adapted by changing their vests from orange to lemon yellow, as well as keeping their voices low in order to not rouse suspicion. While in the U.K., Jones noticed there were a lot of security cameras everywhere, so many that some of them ended up watching each other. Because of this, he had the idea to place two fake cameras facing each other, as if they were watching themselves.
Eventually, “Darius Jones” became just as limiting to Reid as “Verbs” once was. Under the “Jones” moniker, Reid was able to get away with some things, but many of his ideas were still too big, requiring permissions and funding. So, Reid left behind his two aliases and took on a legal, professional role with his birth name. Reid’s first legally permitted work was parking meters that were turned upward, eating leaves instead of quarters. Reid had to convince people both to let him build as well as fund these sculptures. This shift required the artist to use words as a tool to find backing. One of these newer pieces, entitled “Free as a Bird,” was done on top of a prison building. It showed a turkey vulture whose talons were padlocked to the building, trying unsuccessfully to fly away.
Reid and Seslow are currently seeking donations to help launch their latest project, Technophemora, to be installed on the LIU Post campus from September 2014 to April 2015. The installation will feature an archaeological site filled with dated technology cast out of concrete, like a hardware graveyard. The artists are seeking $9,550 for the project, which will be in collaboration with LIU Post undergraduate students studying visual art and archaeology. Donations will go towards the casting and mold making process: rubber molds, liquid concrete, and rewards such as artwork for the donators. These donations will also help determine the size and extent of the installation.

Multi-platinum selling artist Gavin DeGraw took his “Make a Move Tour” to The Space at Westbury, on Thursday, April 3. He fired off a repertoire of new and old hits to the excitement of the audience. People of all ages had found their way to the Westbury venue, which offered both standing and seated tickets – all of them sold-out.
DeGraw entered the stage to the intro of “Make a Move,” which is also the title of his latest album, as well as the ongoing tour. It was clear that we were up for a night of non-stop singing along, as the crowd seemed to know all of the lyrics.
DeGraw continued with his new song “Heartbreak,” and the old hit “Chariot,” and it did not take long before the standing crowd had turned The Space into a dance floor.
The 37-year-old musician grew up in South Fallsburg, New York, and seemed happy to take the tour to his home state. Throughout the show, he interacted with the audience, shared anecdotes about his songs, made jokes, and took pictures of himself with the crowd.
DeGraw has established a devoted fan-base since his breakthrough, which appeared clear as his decade-old songs from the “Chariot” album caused just as much excitement with the audience as his new songs. “Some of you don’t know me, and some of you might know me too well,” said DeGraw, tongue-in-cheek, to the enthusiastic crowd.
It would be an understatement to claim that DeGraw’s last album has been successful since its release in October; before the year-end, it reached number 10 on the U.S. Billboard 200 list, and at least half of the 11 songs have been frequently played on the radio since, including “Best I Ever Had,” “Who’s Gonna Save Us,” and “Different for Girls.”
DeGraw released his first album, “Chariot,” in 2003, which included hits like “Follow Through,” “Chariot,” “Belief,” and “I Don’t
Want To Be.” The latter was also the theme song for the popular television drama series “One Tree Hill,” which he occasionally appeared on. The album went platinum in 2005. Since then, DeGraw has
released four more albums, therein his 2008 self-titled album “Gavin DeGraw,” including the tracks “In Love With a Girl,” and the 2011 album “Sweeter,” with songs like “Not Over You” and “Soldier.”
This year, DeGraw had the honor of opening for Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden, as the artist has established a residency at the venue. To honor Joel, DeGraw shared a nostalgic memory of his teenage- self going to a Joel concert, followed by playing his own version of Joel’s “She’s Always a Woman.”
When DeGraw left the stage after an hour-long parade of old and new hit songs, the crowd chanted him back, and – to its vocal rejoicing – was offered an encore in the form of “Not Over You.”
Janne Eeg, a sophomore International Studies major and a 22-year-old Norwegian Gavin DeGraw fan, jostled to the front of the T-shirt sales table with close to a hundred other fans after the concert. While trying to get ahead in the crowd, she excitingly explained that she has listened to DeGraw’s music for several years now.
“The 14-year-old girl in me was so present tonight,” Eeg said, laughing. “It was so incredibly awesome,” she added, before finally reaching the sales table, and purchasing a Gavin DeGraw tour T-shirt.
During the spring, DeGraw will continue to travel with the “Make a Move Tour” through the country. In the summer, he and his fellow singer and friend, Matt Nathanson, will head out on a mutual U.S. tour. Meanwhile, DeGraw will continue to open for Joel in Madison Square Garden, and at other locations.

The character of Captain America has been an icon of patriotism, heroic stoicism, and naturally, Marvel Comics for nearly 73 years. The first big screen debut of “Captain America: The First Avenger” raked $65 million on its 2011 opening weekend in North America alone, according to Imdb.com.

“Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” was released on Friday, April 4, and was the second installment of the Marvel series. It grossed $37 million in North America on opening day, according to Forbes.com. If that doesn’t scream American nationalism in movie culture, consider yourself a propagator of HYDRA. However, what brought audiences together for the first “Captain” movie, might be the reason why other fans shy away from “Winter Soldier.”
Reprising his role as Steve “Captain” Rodgers, Chris Evans
(“Not Another Teen Movie”) once again captivates the audience with his performance as the leader of the Avengers. This time, the story follows Cap, as he and the Black Widow, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson (“Her”), investigate a hostage situation involving S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives and a secret satellite operation, which threatens humanity itself. Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson (“Pulp Fiction”), also returns as a more prominent character, unlike previous films where he was more or less a figurehead.
While the reoccurring actors do their best, and are successful in their roles, it is newcomer Anthony Mackie (“The Hurt Locker”), as Sam “Falcon” Wilson, who steals the show.
His quick and witty banter, along with being a rather useful sidekick, make him and Evans a winning combination. Sadly, this humor is not dispersed evenly throughout the film, which makes dialogue between the characters seem dry – even forced at times.
Along with the lack of jokes throughout the film – making a two-hour long movie seem even longer – “Winter Soldier” is a much darker picture than its predecessor. One of the villains of the movie, the obvious Winter Soldier, does not read comical; unlike Red Skull from “First Avenger.” The character seems all too realistic, making for one of the most threatening villains in Marvel movie history thus far. Not only does the movie give off darker undertones, the atmosphere of the movie is hard to read at times. This may be due to the lack of lighting around certain characters and scenes, which alludes to an ulterior motive of that character. Nevertheless, if you have trouble seeing the film, you surely will not have trouble hearing it. “Winter Soldier” is jam-packed with explosions, guns, and hard-hitting punches that will rattle your eardrums.
If you decide to see “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” go for the characters – stay for the action. However, here is a fair warning: The plot does become a tad convoluted, and with a dull script, it can be hard to pay attention. “Winter Soldier” attempts something outside of the normal, family-oriented films Marvel Studios puts out, while also trying to appeal to the hard-core fans.
“Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is in theaters now.

On Saturday, March 29, the Pioneer Men’s Lacrosse team, the no. 9 ranked team of the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (currently 5-2), squared off against the no. 15 ranked Griffins of Chest- nut Hill College (3-4). The East Coast Conference clash featured an epic comeback by the Pioneers, overcoming a four-goal deficit at halftime to win 10-9 on enemy turf.
It seemed to be the Griffins day early on, as they scored five un- answered goals in the second period. Senior attackman Michael Mel- nychenko, and sophomore attackman Michael Plaia combined for four of the nine goals for the Griffins, pushing their lead to 6-2 at the half.
The third period was a different story, as the Pioneers came out more aggressive, out-shooting their opponent by 10 points, which helped narrow the deficit to 7-5 heading into the last frame.
Post sophomore midfielder Anthony Berardis tied up the game at seven with two goals in the fourth period, giving him three for the match. The Pioneers took a two-goal lead with just over five minutes remaining in the game, giving them a 9-7 advantage. The Griffins, however, scored twice in the final minute of the game to tie it up at 9-9. With just over 30 seconds on the clock, sophomore attackman Matty Beccaris scored the go-ahead and eventual game winning goal for the Green and Gold.
Senior defenseman T.J. McAndrew caused three turnovers in the game, and also accounted for the assist on Beccaris’ game winning goal. The Pioneers won 11 of 21 faceoffs and converted on two of the five extra man opportunities as well.
Coach Jez and his squad are back in action on Wed. Apr. 2 when they travel to Merrimack College. Game time is set for 4 pm.

Having climbed one more spot in the National Fastpitch Coaches Association ranking from last week, the no. 22 women’s Softball team continued their winning streak in their two East Coast Conference double-headers on April 3, and April 5.
On Thursday, April 3, the visitors from St. Thomas Aquinas College earned the first point of game one, but did not manage to hold on to it very long. Once senior batter Nicole Hagenah blasted one ball over the fence, the Pioneers took over the game. With a continuous flow from Hagenah, the runners were able to reach base after base to gain an advantage over STAC.
In the limelight, freshman Melissa Peet hit her first collegiate homerun. The Spartans from STAC tried to force back into the game, but to no avail. Finally, the Pioneers, with Hagenah at peak, swept the first game, 6-3.
In the nightcap game, the Green and Gold exploded from the start, and gained a handful of runs in the first inning. Again, Hagenah had a perfect run, as she was counted for a three-for-three game, which led to two runners-batted-in (RBI’s); Hagenah hit safely, and the on- base runner was able to make it to home plate.
After two innings, LIU Post was up 6-0, and despite an attempt in the third, St. Thomas Aquinas never came close to advancing. The Pioneers won the second pitch of the day comfortably, totaling out STAC 14-4.
On Saturday, April 5, the Pioneers hit the road to face Queens College in Flushing, N.Y. It seemed as if the short drive was not fully out of their system when the game started, since the QC Knights took advantage of the situation. In an explosive manner, the opponents from Queens acted as kings of the battlefield, as they fought themselves up to a 4-0 lead in the first inning.
For the first time this season, the visitors’ perfect record was at stake. However, the Green Machine woke up, and turned the game around. In the end, the Pioneers swept the Knights off the feet in the opening clash, with a score of 6-4.
The second battle of the day differed very much from the opener. It was all about the individual duel between the pitchers, since both teams had a hard time scoring to begin with. Not until the fourth inning did Post score their first point, but thereafter, the Pioneers were unstoppable, scoring six runs in a row. The final count shone 6-1 on the score- board, and the Green and Gold remains unbeatable in the East Coast Conference so far.
The Pioneers will hit the road again to face Mercy College in a double-header in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., on April 12. The opener is sched- uled for 2 p.m.

Trailing by a tally five minutes in, the Pioneers (10-0) took a 7-1 lead over Roberts Wesleyan College on Saturday, March 29, in an East Coast Conference match in Rochester, N.Y. Senior midfielder Katie Rotan led the charge, scoring three goals within the eight minute burst. 
Senior attacker Jackie Sileorecorded another eight-point showing, scoring two goals and six assists. Sileo’s performance put her only four points shy of breaking the NCAA’s all-time scoring record. Junior midfielder Jenna Pierro also played a very strong game, netting three goals along with three helpers. The Pio- neers worked together as a cohesive unit, as senior attacker Morgan Chiarenza and freshman attacker Stefani Vagelatos were both forces, finishing with five points apiece. Junior defender Kali Maxwell and freshman midfielder Connor Bird set the tone of the game by winning 10 draw controls combined. Senior attacker Samantha Losco also chipped in with a hat trick and three draw controls. 
The Redhawks (4-7) refused to go away, as Cassley Jackowski closed the gap to 8-4 with 1:36 remaining in the half. However, the Green and Gold’s Vagelatos and Losco found the back of the pen in a 26 second span, giving the Pioneers a 10-4 lead heading into the intermission. 
The Pioneers never looked back as they pulled away in the second half, scoring eight of the first nine tallies, leading them to a 19-6 victory. The Green and Gold dominated in shots (37-14) and draws (21-6). Post also held a slim edge in ground balls (19-17) and was a perfect 12-12 on clears. The Pioneers were also efficient on free-position shots, going three-for-four. In the cage, senior goalie Katie Hannan recorded six saves. Her counterparts Victoria Link and Paige Higgins, combined for 11 stops. 
After the game, Morgan Chiarenza mentioned that the team needed to stay positive and not look into the past. She thinks the Pioneers need to continue to grow in every aspect by building on their strengths and weaknesses, which could eventually lead the team to the national championship game. Chiarenza’s hard work has paid off, as she and her teammates are getting to where they want to be as the season comes to a close. “Choice not chance,” Chiarenza said.
The top-ranked Pioneers returned to action Wednesday, April 2, where they edged out their archrival, Dowling, 14-9 at Golden Lions Field in Brookhaven, N.Y. The Green and Gold received a huge lift from Sileo, who amassed eight points and became the NCAA’s all-time leading scorer across all divisions. Sileo had a total of four goals and four assists, boosting her career total to 505 career points, which surpassed former record-holder Ashley Hansberry, who accumulated 500 points at Divi- sion III Curry College from 2008-2011. 
Although Sileo had a career day, the Pioneers (11-0) trailed 4-3 early on. However, they scored three unanswered goals to take 6-4 lead at the intermission. In the latter stanza, the Pioneers started out by going on a 6-1 run, led by senior attacker Losco and freshman attacker Vagelatos, who scored two goals apiece during that juncture. The Pioneers would go on to secure their 34th consecutive victory. 
Senior midfielder Rotan collected two points (1G, 1A), six ground balls, three draw controls, and caused three turnovers. The Pioneers put up a wall defensively, as junior defender Kali Maxwell caused seven turnovers, picked up six grounds balls, and four draw controls. In addition, senior de- fender Melissa Rohr and junior defender Emily Hanifan each scooped up four ground balls. Hannan made seven saves while her opposition, Tina Fey, had 11 saves in the pen.
The Pioneers outshot the Golden Lions, 31-19, and held the advantage in ground balls, 24-17. Dowling won the draw control, 14-11.
