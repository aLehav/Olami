For the 2014-2015 academic year, LIU Post has created a new administrative office to oversee all aspects of campus life. Previously, the Office of Student Life & Leadership and the Office of Residence Life have operated separately, each with its own director and staff. This summer, those two departments have been merged into one department called Campus Life, under the leadership of Michael Berthel, the new Director of Campus Life.
Campus Life is a new way of thinking about the student experience at LIU Post,” said Michael Berthel, who joined the university in 2010 as an Associate Director at the Office of Student Life and Leadership. “Our goal is to make sure that students are enjoying their time on campus, and that includes their time in the residence halls,
at campus events, and in our clubs and Greek organizations. Student Life and Leadership and Residence Life worked closely in the past, and we wanted to formalize that partnership in order to build a vibrant and exciting campus life for all of our students.”
Berthel stated that the main motivation behind making this change was the desire to create more of a team approach in engaging students; as well as addressing all of the needs and interests of students on campus, and creating new initiatives that will benefit everyone. Under this new concept, Residence Hall Directors will now be called “Campus Life Coordinators,” and they will be focusing on providing programs, services, and opportunities that will make attending Post memorable for both residential students and commuter students alike.
“First, I want to make sure students understand the new model and how it will benefit them and the campus community,” said Berthel. “But my main goal, and the goal of our entire office, is to create a vibrant student experience. By focusing our efforts on the student experience as a whole, rather than looking at it in segments, we will be able to better serve all Post students.”
The combined office will now consist of 11 staff members, who will all be based in Hillwood Commons. In August, the Office of Residence Life was moved from Post Hall to the second floor of Hillwood, just above the Office of Student Life.
While Berthel is energetic and eager to start the new academic year as leader of the combined departments, student opinion is varied. Some claim that this is the just the change that LIU Post needs to rejuvenate the campus, the students, and the efficiency of the administration, while others are cautious about its benefit to students.
“I think that homogenizing Residence Life and Student Life into one is a really smart move,” said Katie Gambino, a junior Journalism major “I’m a fan of everything that makes the service of students simpler and easier.”
Others, however, claim that this change was necessary due to the onslaught of various members of the administration quitting, including former Director of Student Life, Alerie Tirsch, and the former Director and Assistant Director of Residence Life, Jennifer Fuoco and Sean Lazarus.
“I’m not so sure about this whole new Campus Life thing,” said Melanie Spina, a junior Sociology major and Journalism minor. “It was hard enough for [Residence Life and Student Life] to serve students before when they were separate and had even more people working for them. Now, with even less employees and only one department, I worry that it won’t be efficient.”
Although Spina is not resistant to change at Post and remains optimistic that it could possibly be a positive change for the campus, she has reservations about the outcome. Only time will tell if this new Campus Life office will transform Post into a more efficient and student- oriented campus.

On Wednesday, Sept. 3, LIU Post officially re-opened its gates to students. About 1,600 students, including the vast majority of the 15 varsity sports teams and a large percentage of the international student community, moved into the campus resident halls, ready to get this upcoming semester underway. Despite the big move-in day, Director of Campus Life, Michael Berthel, informed The Pioneer that not all student dorms would be open for the fall semester.
According to Berthel, Queens Hall and Kings Hall will not provide housing for students this semester. Kings Hall was closed last year due to a drop in student enrollment, thus Facilities staff took the opportunity to renovate the residence hall by removing carpet, installing new flooring, and painting the dorm rooms and common lounges. Although in 2009, Queens Hall was closed and underwent similar renovations yet re-opened the following year, the residence hall will close again this semester. Additionally, Riggs basement will no longer be available for housing as it is officially the new practice area of the men’s wrestling team. Nassau’s basement will also be closed due to renovations.
In spite of the closure of these halls, Berthel stated that the same amount of residence halls is open this year as last year because other dorms were also closed. “The only difference is that we opened the South Residence Complex (SRC) this year, which was closed last year. This was because students wanted a suite-style [accommodation] and we wanted to accommodate that and offer a different housing option for students.”
The Director of Campus life also announced that SRC is open exclusively for upperclassmen students. “We heard from students who wanted to open SRC and take advantage of suite-style living, and we were happy to offer that.”
According to senior Psychology major Nadia Fernando, the re- opening of the SRC will be a huge social boost for the school. “During my freshman and sophomore years, when the suites were open for both students and student athletes, there was certainly more of a community feel on campus.” The suite-style accommodation allowed up to eight people in double rooms to live together and to share a common living area as well as a semi-private bathroom. “It was a great way of making instant friends and there was always something going on.
Although LIU Post faces a dramatic decrease in enrollment this year, the majority of the five additional sports teams that have been added to LIU Post’s Varsity Athletic Department (which include men’s wrestling, women’s fencing, women’s golf, and men’s and women’s indoor and outdoor track and field) are expected to live on campus. The Residence Life Department, which moved over the summer from Post Hall to the second floor of Hillwood Commons, is confident that they can accommodate any student who wishes to reside on campus.
When asked if Queens Hall and Kings Hall would possibly be available to students by Spring 2015, Berthel stated: “We review the needs of our residential community each semester to determine if we need to re-evaluate which buildings we are using….The demand and needs are always changing.”
To help encourage a sense of hospitality and community in the residential halls, the Campus Life staff assigned students based on their interests and preferences. This includes athletic involvement, Greek affiliation, and academic major. Berthel added, “Each of our residence halls form a unique personality based on the students that live in
them. It easily allows everyone to find [his or her] home in one of our halls.” Post, Riggs, Nassau, Suffolk, and Brookville are traditional-style dorms, providing two, three, or four-person rooms that open into a common hallway, where residents in each hallway share a large common bathroom.
However, Suffolk and Nassau offer more specialized options. Suffolk Hall is a traditional-style hall designed for 24-hour intensified study for students who prefer a quiet, academic-centered environment, which is why it’s popular amongst Honors students. Unlike the other residence halls, Nassau offers the additional benefit of long-stay accommodations over vacations and in between semesters, thus the dorm is known to house international students, those who work on campus, and those who register for classes during the winter semester, as well as winter athletic teams.
With the opening of Nassau, Suffolk, SRC, Brookville, Riggs, and Post for the fall semester, the students of LIU Post who reside on campus had moved in by Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2014.

This fall, LIU Post instituted an innovative program called the First Year Service Experience, which was open to all incoming freshmen. The program, run by the Office of Campus Life, offers students an opportunity to better themselves and their time at LIU Post, mainly through meeting other students, getting involved on campus, and kick starting their college careers.
Students volunteered for the program, and were tasked to become more involved with school activities. Samantha Gottlieb, Assistant Director of Campus Life and Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, were the administrators behind this program and led the First Year Experience.
The First Year Experience was not a required part of the transition into Post, and was completely voluntary and only open to students graduating with the class of 2018. Students were encouraged to sign up both during the summer and during orientation. 22 freshmen participated in the First Year Service Experience. The program was new to LIU Post this year, yielding a small turnout for student volunteers.
The program lasted two days, from Sept. 1 to Sept. 2. On day one, the participants were able to get to know each other better in a community setting. That night, the students had a program barbeque and an ice cream social. All of the commuter students stayed overnight in the dorms to build a stronger relationship between the residents and the commuters.
Day two consisted of a hands-on-service project at multiple locations in New York City. Students were put into groups and serviced the poor, hungry, and homeless at different locations throughout four of the five city boroughs.
Christopher Scally, a junior Information Technology major, wished he would have known about the experience: “Although I am a junior, I wish I had the chance to do this First Year Experience as a freshman when starting here at LIU Post. It seems like a fun way to help out and get to know more people both on and off campus.”
The service portion of the First Year Service Experience was organized through the Youth Service Opportunities Project (YSOP). The participants visited four different sites and did different service work at each of these sites. One of the groups went to Jan Hus Presbyterian Church on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and organized a clothing donation, and helped to distribute food to a food pantry.
Another group of students gardened and cared for the grounds at the McKinley Children’s Garden in Queens. A third group went to Trinity Lutheran, where they cooked and serviced a soup kitchen and handed out food to the hungry. The last group of participants went to Masbia, a restaurant-style soup kitchen in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where students prepared and served dinner to people later that night.
“We anticipate the volunteer number only getting larger as we continue to run the program year after year,” said Berthel. There were also six upperclassmen students that helped guide the new students through the program and to the various sites around the city. These upperclassmen volunteered to help out with the program, and provide assistance to the younger lowerclassmen.
“We received a lot of positive feedback and cannot wait to do similar programs throughout the year,” Berthel added. Berthel stated that the program was an oveall success, despite the small number of students who participated, and that it achieved its goal of uniting students together, both commuters and non-commuters, for a good cause.

When Dr. Kimberly R. Cline took office on July 1, 2013, she became LIU Post’s 10th president, as well as the first woman to hold the position. She came into her presidency overseeing a school that was combating low enrollment, and one that was featured in an Aug. 2013, Forbes magazine article, titled, “Is Your College Going Broke? The Most and Least Financially Fit Schools In America.”
The 2013 article claimed that LIU had been running at an operating deficit for the last three years. Cline stressed that the ongoing changes are meant to create a better collegiate experience for students. “We want to focus on making sure that we’re providing a student-centered university, where students are first in our minds all the time,” Cline stated during the July 31 interview.
One way Cline has tried to improve the university is by expanding the correlation between what students learn in the classroom in relation to what they will experience in the real world.
“The student run businesses that we started last year are an effort to marry up all the base that happens in the classroom, to real life work experience,” Cline said. “If we have more student-run businesses on campus, [students] can actually participate in the development of a business, they can help run the business, and they have something on their resume that other people don’t have.”
This new experiment in student entrepreneurship started on Nov. 12, 2013, with the opening of The Student Body Boutique, a clothing store on the second floor of Hillwood Commons. It was the first student-run business on any LIU campus.
The Post Treat Shoppe, which sells baked goods and candy, is another student-run business that opened on the first floor of Hillwood on Jan. 29, 2014. The End Zone, a non-alcoholic sports bar that sells pub style food, was also added to the first floor of the Commons, becoming the third student-run business on campus. The End Zone’s grand opening was held on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 2, 2014.
Cline said that additional businesses are in the works for the upcoming 2014-2015 academic year. “We’re going to open a high-tech store that is going to be sanctioned by Apple. It is going to be a working laboratory, so if you have an issue with your computer, [or] if you want to ask [a] question, you can go in and they’ll be right there. ” The new tech store will replace The Head Quarters computer lab, which was located on the second floor of Hillwood Commons near the Steinberg Art Museum.
Cline stated that Bethpage Federal Credit Union is opening a bank on the second floor of Hillwood as well, replacing the Nassau Educators Federal Credit Union (NEFCU). “They’re going to hire students, and if the [students] do well they [can become] future managers and employees of the bank,” Cline said.
The opening of a BFCU branch on campus is part of a larger deal between the university and the bank. On March 19, 2014, LIU Post announced the credit union’s corporate sponsorship to the tune of $1.5 million for the naming rights to Post’s renovated football stadium. The new stadium opened this past weekend on Saturday, September 6.
Despite the many changes in operations and personnel made during her first year in office, Cline hopes to accomplish a lot more during the upcoming year. “We want to start a PR marketing firm, and we want to start a student incubator firm that focuses on high-tech companies [and] app development.” Dr. Cline believes high-tech development initiatives should become an essential part of LIU’s academia.
Cline’s vision is a work in progress, and she feels her first year in office has been a productive one. “I think we accomplished a great deal. Just having the community come together and work on a strategic plan that’s going to chart our vision for 2020 is really important,” Cline said. “When we’re talking about who we want to be, I think we want to make sure that we’re providing great value for our students, we want to make sure that we are providing an excellent education, and we want to try to keep ourselves affordable.”

The partnership announced during the Spring 2014 semester between Bethpage Federal Credit Union (BFCU) and LIU Post resulted in a new stadium, as well as a new bank on campus. BFCU will open a branch on the second floor of Hillwood Commons. The grand opening is planned to take place sometime this fall, with “a tentative mid- October target date,” said Rita Langdon, executive Director of Campus Operations and Strategic Partnerships.
Students at Post can expect to get all their banking needs fulfilled, according to Langdon. “The Bethpage Federal Credit Union facility will be a full-service financial institution on the LIU Post campus, offering a complete line of products and services. Students, faculty and staff will be able to open accounts, apply for loans, and attend financial literacy seminars,” she said. Also, the ATM fee will be waived, according to Langdon. BFCU will replace the previous National Employees Federal Credit Union (NEFCU) bank that resided in Hillwood Commons until last December.
The opening of the BFCU campus branch is just the beginning of a new partnership between the university and the bank. BFCU sponsored the $1.5 million renovation of the new stadium, and has been given naming rights, according to an article published in The Pioneer on March 26, 2014.
Langdon said that the new bank will work with LIU Post’s Promise program and employer relations to offer internship opportunities for students. “Bethpage Federal Credit Union offers a paid summer internship program to Long Island college students,” she said.
Student reaction to the new bank opening on campus has been favorable. “I think it’s good because we still need a place to cash our checks if you don’t have a card, and it helps a lot on campus because we don’t have another bank here,” said Junior Psychology major Brittany Burgos, a junior Psychology major. Burgos hopes that the employees are patient. “I think customer service is very important,” she said.
Senior Forensic Science major and Chemistry minor Samantha Coppola agreed: “It’s nice [that] it’s going to be on campus so you don’t have to leave to do your banking. [I can use the] ATMs, I can go in and talk to somebody about my banking account, or deposit and withdraw money.”

With the commencement of the Fall 2014 semester, LIU Post introduced significant changes regarding student stipends. Students with bigger positions within LIU Post clubs and organizations, such as the Student Government Association (SGA), the Residence Assistants (RAs), The Pioneer, and the Association for Campus Programming (ACP) will no longer be compensated for their work on campus.
According to Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students, the decision to eliminate stipends was based on discussions between the SGA and Campus Life Leadership. Dean Van Vlerah said that these stipends have previously been funded through student activity fees, which LIU students pay each semester.
“Ensuring a fair, equitable and balanced practice is an important and ongoing process that guarantees th[e] students’ funds are utilized in the best possible ways, and to provide the most benefit for all students,” Dean Van Vlerah said.
However, there are rare exceptions to the new “no stipend” policy. The SGA president, as well as students at the campus radio station, MYWCWP Radio, will continue to receive stipends for their work. Since MYWCWP is part of the LIU Post School of Visual and Performing Arts, and therefore is not considered a club, student activity fees do not fund these stipends.
“WCWP is a department of the School of Visual and PerformingArts from which we receive an operating budget that includes funding for a limited number of part-time staff and student budget positions,” said Dan Cox, Director of Broadcasting at WCWP Radio.
“We also raise money through underwriting of programming on our public radio service, WCWP/88.1fm, and advertising we sell on our student radio station, mywcwp.org,” Cox added.
Dianne Zoppa, Director of Public Relations at LIU Post, confirms that the station’s operating budget from the School of Visual and Performing Arts is also funded by students, through student tuition fees.
“We are pleased, through LIU’s Career Services, to provide many opportunities for on-campus jobs that a student can secure at Post to gain valuable workplace skills, earn money while still at school, and make the professional connections they need to launch their careers,” Zoppa said.
Zoppa added, “Therefore, you will find students working in the Tilles Center, at the radio station, in the library, and across campus, making students one of our largest employment groups.”
When The Pioneer reached out to students affected by the new policy, none of them were willing to comment on the stipend cuts, as it would tarnish their reputation.

On May 19, 15 members of the Newman Catholic Community on campus embarked on a weeklong journey to Tijuana, Mexico. The trip was part of an initiative called “Builders of Hope,” which works in conjunction with Esperanza International (esperanzaint.org), an organization that builds dignified housing for the needy populous of Tijuana County in Baja California, Mexico.
“During the week, the Newman members worked on one home,” said Father Ted Brown, the campus priest and faculty advisor of the club that led the expedition. “They dug the trenches for the foundation, put in the foundation, and put in a nine-foot high retaining wall to prevent the home from sliding into a canyon.”
“While on the worksite, the family receiving the home works next to us, and cooks the noontime meal for us. We mix with the [local] people. About half the [Newman] group could speak Spanish, so communication was easy,” Brown added.
This is not the first time that the club has done community service abroad in Tijuana: “This is the 13th trip for us,” Brown said. “Over the years, we have worked on 27 homes, and changed the lives of 27 families. We have a commitment to the people. By going back to the same neighborhoods year to year, trust builds up. We have made a difference in one the poorest sections of Mexico,” he added.
When asked about their experiences on the excursion, Post students who participated in “Builders of Hope” had much to say about the spiritual and intellectual growth the trip merited them.
“Ever since I was a high school student I’ve always liked community service and [helping] those in need,” said Miguel Montalvo, a senior Broadcasting major. “[W]hen I heard about the trip from Father Ted, and how it was an international service project helping [to] build communities for the poor…, I knew this was something that would interest me, and be a great experience.”
“All week you put so much effort and labor into this project, and by the end of the week you actually see everything you’ve done pay off,” said Christina Scozzari, a senior Broadcasting major. “You see the structure of a home for a family, and the emotional impact it has on them. Even though it was only a week, you develop such a special bond with these people that is unexplainable and yet so special,” Scozzari added.
“If you have never [left] your home, your neighborhood, or your community, this trip is for you. It allows you to open your mind about your surroundings, and may give a purpose to your life,” Stanley Edmond, a senior Political Science major, said.
“The most rewarding part of the experience is at the end when you see all that the team has accomplished together without even having previous construction experience, and the faces of the families and children who you are building the house for is priceless,” Montalvo added.
“I would most certainly encourage anyone to go,” said Scozzari. “You grow as a person, you make new friends and memories you won’t ever forget, and you experience the heart of Mexican culture. You experience the harsh reality of the poverty they live in, but [also] the warm hearts of the people, and that’s what will have you coming back year after year.”
Father Ted already has plans for next year’s trip to Tijuana: “We will start recruiting early in the semester. Last year, [the club] raised about $5,000, [which covered the program fee], so most [of the students who went this summer] only paid for room and board ($200) and airfare.”
“The service trip fills up very quickly, [and the] meeting for the trip begin[s] late in the fall,” said David Armas, a senior Sociology major and the student coordinator for next year’s “Builders of Hope” trip. “The upcoming trip [takes] place on May 23 to the 30. Information is available at liupostcatholic.org. Click on ‘outreach’ and then ‘Builders of Hope’.”
“[This trip] is an experience that changes the lives of so many people, including the volunteers,” Armas added. “I’ve come to learn so much from them including the humility of living a life not [based on] materiality, but [rather] one based on love and camaraderie.”

After the spring semester ends, we all know that summer break is something to look forward to in order to relieve stress, encourage relaxation, and just kick back and have a good time. Sounds like the perfect thing for a student, especially after a long year of tests, homework, and papers. However, does all that time off during the summer also encourage academic laziness?
According to an article by Nick Chiles, published on Aug. 27 in “The Hechinger Report,” a nonprofit newsroom focused on the most important topics in education today, it absolutely does.
“If children are not intellectually stimulated during the summer, if they don’t do reading and other activities to keep their brains firing at optimal levels, they will need weeks —if not months —to get back up to speed in the fall,” said Chiles.
Summer represents many things, but it also signifies a decline in academic presence. Therefore, it was given the name “the summer slide.” With the term, Chiles dives further into detail, revealing the extent of how bad academic deprivation during summer vacation can get.
“An argument can be made that summer slide is the most severe, under-addressed problem in the American education ecosystem. After all, fixing it would mean stomping on the American idyll of lazy sun- drenched days. Summers are the precious amber of so many childhoods. Year-round schools? That would be like desecrating apple pie,” Chiles stated.
Does summer slide affect college students as well?
Senior Electronic Media major Connor Vogt is not so sure. “I worked 10-hour days over the summer, but I would always read when I got home. I try not to get too academically lazy over the summer because then it’s harder to get the brain going once classes begin again,” Vogt said. “If I do get lazy, I try to snap myself out of it quickly.”
Sophomore Broadcasting major Richard Renelique, on the other hand, admits that he gets lazy in the summer. “I definitely do become lazy after summer vacation, because I am taken out of the routine of studying and handing in assignments,” he said. “My brain adjusts to
the endless possibilities of free time, and makes me have absolutely no desire to do schoolwork.”
Renelique, though, is optimistic about getting back into a school routine. “To get back into routine I will need to remind myself of my goals and remember how rewarding it is to work hard.”
In case you find yourself as one of the students still in a daze trying to readjust to school, here are some tips to help you get back into routine. Provided by ‘lifehacker.com,’ a site known for providing “tips, tricks and downloads for getting things done.” Here are some to remember this semester:
1. Start your day right: well-rested and with a good breakfast 2. Get started early
3. Plan your day and week
4. Start with small stuff you can check off
5. Tackle your e-mails in order of importance
Summer vacation can recharge many students, especially
after countless, sleepless nights of homework and studying. However, remember that it is also important to maintain the flow of brain activity. Whether it would be working during the summer, or treating yourself to some episodes on Netflix. After working hard on a goal, it is important to keep your brain stimuli healthy and ready for the upcoming school semester.

The LIU Post men’s soccer team was selected as the preseason favorite to win a third-straight East Coast Conference crown in 2014 in a coaches’ poll. The Pioneers were the unanimous favorite to land the top spot based on their track record in the last few seasons. The Green and Gold have won two straight ECC Championships, three in the last five years, and last season they spent four weeks as No. 1 in the country.
The Pioneers took their preseason accolades and went into battle against the Owls of Southern Connecticut State University on Thursday, Sept. 4. It was the first match of the season for both sides. The Owls did not waste any time on offense as they scored just 72 seconds into the contest. Sophomore defender Alex Soriano sent a cross to the middle
of the field where fellow sophomore forward Kevin Joslyn was able to head the ball passed the LIU goalkeeper. The goal made it 1-0, putting the pressure on the Pioneers early, as they would have to climb out of an early hole.
Freshman Owl keeper Noah Veronier kept the explosive Pioneers offensive off the board, posting his first career shutout at a collegiate level. The Pioneers’ best chance to score came late in the second half, as senior forward Eivind Austboe got behind the defense and was able to get off a shot that sailed over the crossbar. The goal early in the game stood as the Owls defeated the Pioneers 1-0.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Sept. 6 to face the Panthers of Adelphi University. The Pioneers exploded for five goals, four of which came from Austboe. Austboe and company wasted no time getting the scoring started, as they scored the fifth-fastest goal in NCAA Division II history just nine seconds into the game. After a second goal late in the first half by Austboe, the visitors pushed their lead to 2-0, and were in great position to take the victory.
The second half was more of the same from the Pioneers. Austboe sent his third shot passed the goalkeeper, making it 3-0. A little over
two minutes later, freshman forward Jason Lampkin found the back of the net off an assist from Austboe. The goal was the first at the collegiate level for Lampkin. The exclamation point for the Pioneers came when Austboe scored his fourth goal of the contest off a precise pass from junior midfielder Matias Ruiz. The goal made it 5-0, which was the final score in the contest.
As a team, the Pioneers dominated the Panthers as they outshot them 14-5, and doubled them in shots on goal. Junior goalkeeper Jesper Malstrom made three saves and kept the Panthers off the board, earning his first win as a Pioneer.
Coach Andreas Lindberg and the Pioneers hit the field next on Thursday, Sept. 11, when they travel to Bridgeport, Conn. to take part in the Purple Knight Classic, hosted by the University of Bridgeport. LIU will square off against the Warriors of Merrimack College at 4 p.m.
