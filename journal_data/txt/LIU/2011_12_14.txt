The semester has come to a close. Have you had time to go over what you wanted to achieve this semester? Have you met your goals? Well, one can only imagine the number of objectives we’ve set out to accomplish. But, how successful are we in achieving these aspirations?
Graduate students, as well as others, are relieved that the semester is over. Some might agree that most graduate students’ goals consist of maintaining a well-balanced work ethic in order to stay on top of school work and extracurricular activities. In spite of these general assumptions as to the aspirations, the Pioneer took a look at what graduate students on campus had to say. Daniel Lindenmeier, who is pursuing a Master in Business Administration degree, said that one of his goals this semester was to “keep [up] with my classes while working for IT and balancing between the two.” Although this seems like a practical goal, do you think he met it? Lindenmeier affirmed that, “I would definitely say so it worked out well.” Lindenmeier also added that this semester, “[I wanted] to keep up with current events in the business field since I graduated with a B.S. in Information Technology.” Has he met that objective? “I definitely feel like I met that goal with a lot of help from professors here.” This semester, Lindenmeier also had other tangible goals, such as “keep[ing] myself organized.” Like his other goals, Lindenmeier believes that he “did a lot better in that too.”
Other graduate students have laid out different objectives to be accomplished this semester. For example, Tristan Barsky, a student pursuing a Doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology, after graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in English and Research in Psychology, said that “orienting myself to the university” was a primary goal. Barsky added, “I’m from Montreal, and I never lived in New York.” Does he think he has achieved his goal? “Yeah, I think so. [It was] easy to get through because it’s all centralized in one campus.” Another goal Barsky shared was that he wanted  “to meet academic expectations of a doctoral program, since I went directly for my doctorate after my [undergrad].” With regard to his progress in meeting that goal, Barsky said, “I’ve been pretty successful in completing coursework and doing everything effectively.”
Other graduate students agree that excelling in school is a priority. Gabe Jiang, an Accounting major at the Master’s level, said that his major this semester was to “get a higher grade point average because my grades were not good last semester.” On assessing whether he achieved his goal, Jiang stated, “I think I did a better job this semester, and I also found a part-time job.” Kaiqi Wu, another graduate student studying Management Engineering asserted that this semester, he “wanted to finish his thesis” after going through repeated revisions. Has he met his goal? Wu said, “not yet…I hope so.” As can be seen, setting personal goals allow individuals to find themselves and are important for time management. In need of a more balance life? Get a fresh start next semester! The choice is yours.

As the winter season sets upon the C.W. Post Campus, students can look forward to scenic snowfalls, chilly weather, and, unfortunately, cold and flu season. With the potential for germs to spread rapidly throughout residence halls and classrooms, it is imperative that sick students seek medical attention. The health professionals at the Student Health and Counseling Center, otherwise known as the Infirmary, can assist students with their medical and psychological needs.
“If we can handle what students have with the resources we have here, we do,” stated Sylvia Barton, R.N., the Associate Director of Medical Services at the Student Health and Counseling Center. “If not, we have three local hospitals nearby that we can send you to.”
Housed in the basement of Life Sciences/Pell Hall in Room 154, the Student Health and Counseling Center is open Mondays through Fridays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the fall and spring semesters and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the winter and summer sessions. It is staffed by primary care physicians, a gynecologist, a psychiatrist, counselors and nurses, all of whom are bona fide, experienced medical professionals.
Primary care doctors at the Student Health and Counseling Center examine both ill and injured students, diagnose their conditions and treat them with medications if they are able to. If students require more thorough examinations, the doctors on campus refer them to local specialists who can better care for them
“We have limited medications here. We are a dispensary, not a pharmacy, so we dispense the medications that our doctors require,” stated Barton. “We don’t fill prescriptions if you bring them to us from other doctors; we aren’t a pharmacy. But, most medicines we have here cost less than the co-pay you’d pay at a pharmacy.”
In addition to the primary care physicians, the gynecological staff assists female patients with routine exams and provides birth control prescriptions and condoms if needed. For students who do not have insurance or do not wish to use their insurance for certain tests, such as pregnancy blood tests or throat cultures, Barton says that students may pay cash for the tests, and nothing regarding the tests will be sent to their homes. “Everything is confidential here,” she said. However, these tests must be paid for upfront, and they must be paid for via cash or check, as the Infirmary is not equipped with a credit card or debit card swipe machine.
As for students who are suffering from academic or personal stress, relationship troubles, depression, anxiety, low self-confidence, nutritional dilemmas, or are suffering in the wake of a rape or an assault, among other troubles, counseling services are available to offer assistance to students to help them work through these hardships.
According to Barton, the most common reasons students find themselves in the Infirmary are because “they think they have colds, and in the winter, many of them get rhinitis [an inflammation of the mucous membrane in the nose] because of the dry, winter weather. We also see stomach viruses, especially last winter when it was going through the dorms.” She continued, “We’ve also seen more complicated conditions, like asthma and things of that nature.”
While the services at the Student Health and Counseling Center are extensive, many students on campus have little knowledge of the Center’s existence, particularly commuter students who rush to and from campus throughout the day.
“I didn’t even know we had an infirmary, and I don’t know where it is,” said Filomena Pascarella, a senior Elementary Education major.
Other students are aware that C.W. Post has an infirmary, but they have rarely, if ever, utilized its services. “I know that the school has an infirmary, but if I were sick, I would go to my regular doctor because that is more convenient for me,” said Nicole Mylonas, a senior Marketing major.
A junior English major in Professor Ryden’s Creative Nonfiction class, who wished to remain anonymous, added, “I went there like once for condoms. They’re cheaper there.”
Despite this, however, Barton insists that many students walk through the Student Health and Counseling Center’s doors each semester. “It used to be chaotic,” she said. “That’s why students need to make appointments to see the doctors now. But, you don’t need an appointment to see a nurse.”
While it would seem that the Student Health and Counseling Center does its best to aid students, junior Allyson Reynolds, a Childhood Education major, begs to differ. “The Infirmary is not good at all,” she said. “I went there my freshman year because of a pain in my stomach and a cough. They told me it was a sore throat and that my stomach hurt from coughing. I went home later in the week to my doctor to find out that I had a stomach ulcer and mono. I will never go back to the Infirmary.”
For students who are under the weather and can’t get home to their own doctors or counselors, however, the Student Health and Counseling Center may be a good alternative, especially during finals week.
“If you’re having test anxiety, especially now, during finals, you should come see a counselor. There’s no reason to be so stressed that you’re pulling your hair out,” said Nurse Barton. She also reminds students that flu vaccinations are available for $10 in the Infirmary and that it’s not too late to get them.

Throw away your plastic water bottles and replace them with your reusable water containers instead because Post is continuing its installments of hydration stations throughout the campus.
In October, the Pioneer featured efforts that were being made to make Post a more sustainable campus.  So far, there have been two hydration stations installed at the Pratt Recreation Center and one recently installed in Pell Hall.  A hydration station is a touch-free bottle refill system that also purifies the water.   Elkay, a company that installs the stations, reports that more than 150 colleges and universities have installed them.   If installing these stations was not enough to encourage students to use reusable water containers, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education claims that several colleges, including Stony Brook University, New York University, the University of Maryland, and Stanford University have banned bottled water in their dining halls.
Associate Professor of Geography Dr. Scott Carlin has his students collect information, such as the costs and benefits of the systems, and pitched the idea to the Provost.  “This is part of a national movement,” affirmed Carlin.   “We are just starting to see these appear on college campuses.  They will become a much more obvious part of daily life in just a few years.  We should call attention to the fact that, as a campus, we are ahead of the national curve (and Long Island’s curve) in installing these devices.”
The hydration system keeps track of how many bottles have been refilled.  So far, there have been just over 19,000 containers refilled in the Pratt and 1,637 in Pell Hall.  The stations not only reduce the use of plastic bottles, but they also save students money so that they do not have to buy water bottles at machines or campus stores.
In the future, Carlin and his students hope to see the hydration stations installed in each of the main buildings on campus and eventually in the dorm buildings.  Senior Childhood Education major Helene Bruckner is a student in Professor Carlin’s Conservation of Natural Environment Resources course.   “We need to come together as a community and take the first steps towards becoming more sustainable because we are the future,” Bruckner stated.  Bruckner is among many students of Professor Carlin’s who are collaborating to make our campus more eco-friendly.
Senior Geography major Abrom Shepard was part of the hydration station project last semester.  “I feel that the hydration station is probably one of the best investments Post has made to prove that it is aiming for a more sustainable campus.  I feel proud to have been a part of the project and hope to see more installments on campus.”

On December 1st, Showtime, the network that debuted hits, such as “Dexter,” “Californication,” and “Nurse Jackie,” participated in a World AIDS Day celebration. As a part of its marathon, the documentary “Sex in an Epidemic,” by Media Arts Department Professor Jean Carlomusto was aired.
“Sex in an Epidemic” is a historical account of the varying social, sexual and political reactions to the disease’s spread and the way it transformed how Americans thinks about sexual practices, with the creation of the “safe sex” concept.
“The documentary has resonance,” said Professor of Media Arts and Director of the Television Center Jean Carlomusto. “We are talking about HIV prevention at a time when over 50,000 new cases are happening every year. That doesn’t have to be. The drugs can make you sick; they can cause complications, and they are going to be a lifelong hassle to maintain your drug treatment.”
World AIDS Day, established in 1988, is held yearly on December 1st. It is an opportunity for people to unite in the fight against HIV, to show their support, and to commemorate those who died. According to World AIDS Day, an estimated 33.3 million are infected with HIV worldwide. It is one of the most destructive pandemics in history, which has led to over 25 million deaths.
“One of the reasons I made this tape was for my students,” said Carlomusto. “I don’t think it is easy to imagine how bad it was not too long ago. I got the idea for the project when I started working as a volunteer at Gay Men’s Health Crisis in 1985. I used Final Cut to cut this piece and that is exactly the technology I teach. The camera is similar. The technology that I work with is essentially the technology I teach advanced students.”
C.W. Post Information sent out a campus-wide email on December 1st, informing  students and staff about the showing. However, Showtime is not available on campus; a subscription is necessary. Subsequent airings will continue on Sho 2, Showtime Showcase, and Sho Women throughout December and January.
“I am pleased that Showtime chose to air it,” said Carlomusto. “Because the film has some sexual content, it was a little bit harder to get onto a PBS. My only regret was that not everybody has Showtime. My distributor, Outcast Films, arranged the deal. They showed it to Showtime; Showtime expressed interest and gave me a letter of agreement. Basically, my job once I got that letter of agreement was to secure the rights and to get all the necessary insurance for it to air on cable. It was a summer of hell. I love the creative part of making films, but if you are going to show a documentary, especially for broadcast, you have to make sure that you have proper licensing for your footage.”
Although Carlomusto had the idea to make the documentary since 1987, she did not actively start making the tape until about seven or eight years ago. Much of the material came from her archives.
“It’s a pleasure to work with someone who follows her passion and gets to pass it along to her students,” said Adjunct Professor of Electronic Media and Coordinator of the Television Center, Katherine Betka. “After all these years, I am still learning from Jean. I am sure our Broadcasting students feel proud that their full-time faculty members work hard in their fields and get to show their work on such a big platform.”

The Long Island University rebranding is well on its way, with a new logo set to debut next semester.  Aside from the logo, L.I.U. will have a new social media identity, new merchandise and an expansive ad campaign, which will take effect on January 1, 2012.
The University rebranding, which became public after the Pioneer first reported on the issue on November 2, 2011, has been widely talked about by students, alumni, faculty, staff, administration members, and others.
While this semester is nearing its end, L.I.U. prepares to unveil the University’s new image within a matter of weeks. However, due to conflicts between the marketing and launch schedule and the Pioneer’s printing deadline, the new logo is not available, said Rita Langdon, the Associate Provost and Director of Public Relations for the C.W. Post Campus.
Apparel and other merchandise, such as, but not limited to, mugs, book bags and baseball caps, will feature the new L.I.U.- Post logo and will be available at the start of the semester, which is January 17, 2012.
The merchandise will be sold in the campus bookstore and on the Barnes and Noble website. “The bookstore will provide a nostalgia section with ‘C.W. Post’ apparel for interested patrons, such as alumni,” said Langdon.
The semester will begin with a brand launch party, which, according to Langdon, will be an event hosted by the Provost’s office for students, faculty and staff members. The party will be hosted during common hour and will introduce the new logo and promotional items. The campus will give out free t-shirts and prizes with the new logo. No exact date for the event was provided.
As for attending the event, senior Sociology major Josh Stieglitz said he wasn’t sure he would; however, he added, “The changes really don’t affect anything. It’s just going to be something missing.”
Beginning on the first of the New Year, the new University logo and images of students will be seen in Times Square, Herald Square, the Theater District, Long Island Rail Road platforms, L.I.R.R. cars, New York City subways, bus shelters in Suffolk and Nassau Counties, newspapers, kiosks in area malls and in high traffic areas.
The ads will feature the success stories of students and alumni from all of the L.I.U. campuses, said Kim Volpe-Cassalino, the Assistant Vice President for Public Relations for Long Island University. “[The ads] will capture the promise of an L.I.U. education and provide a strategic framework in which to highlight student achievements, celebrate faculty in their roles as scholars and educators and reinforce the notion that every unit of the University is an integral part of one of the largest private universities in America,” Volpe-Cassalino added.
According to the information provided to the Pioneer, Post’s social media and web pages will feature key elements of the branding campaign, including links to TV commercials, print ads, campaign-themed interactive elements and the new logo.
As of January 1, 2012, the new social media sites will be www.facebook.com/LIUPost and www.twitter.com/LIUPost . The LIU website will have the new logo on every page, and student and alumni success stories will be added to top-level pages.
As for physical changes to the Post Campus, “The school colors will remain gold and green, and the east and west gate signage is scheduled to be updated during the spring semester,” said Langdon.
In a statement, Provost Dr. Paul Forestell said, “L.I.U. – Post is proud to share its growth and quality education through a forward-looking and impactful branding campaign.”

The Office of Residence Life sponsored a gingerbread house-building event on Tuesday, December 6th, at 8 p.m. in the Hillwood Fishbowl. The event was another way for students to earn points for their dorms for the cereal bowl competition.
The competition is a series of events that students who dorm can participate in. Each event earns them points. At the end of the year, the dorm with the most points is awarded a trophy.  This event involved members from each dorm making a gingerbread house from scratch.
The Fishbowl was packed with students trying to earn points for their dorm. It was competitive to see who could make the best gingerbread house. Students were provided with supplies to make their gingerbread houses, including cardboard (to place their houses on), graham crackers, food coloring, frosting and candy for decorating.
The event was packed; 100-plus students filled the fishbowl and worked together in groups. They were also being timed. In the last 10 minutes, everyone picked up the pace to finish and add the final touches. When it was over, all the gingerbread houses looked great, and it looked as if everyone had a good time.
Arianna Livereri, an R.A. in Queens Hall, said, “We are here to get more students, both on and off campus involved in student activities. The event is really a good way to get people involved and for students to meet new people.”
For Catherine Andrade, a freshman Forensic Science major, it was an enjoyable thing. “It was fun. It was strenuous because we didn’t have much time,” said Andrade.
Kassandra Thomas, a junior with a dual major in Art History and Fine Arts, also enjoyed the gingerbread hous- building event. “It was fun and interesting. It was messy. It definitely tasted good,” said Thomas.
The yearly event was a big success with the students. It was a way to let loose, have fun, and ring in the holiday season.

“Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cheers; I drink to that. Yeah, yeah…”
No, Rihanna, there wasn’t a party at the bar, but on December 1st, there was one in the Journalism 1 class taught by Adjunct Professor Roberto Soto. Soto brought in a homemade wine to celebrate the birth of his new grandson. Cups, enough for each and every member of the class, which included minors, were placed on the front desk. No one walked out of the classroom, as students were able to help themselves to a drink and pose for class photos and a video, Soto included, which were later uploaded to Facebook by students.
“He didn’t force anybody to drink,” said junior Journalism major Victoria Esteve, who is in the Journalism 1 class. “Half of those people were under age. It was his own wine, too, like soda wine. Technically, he didn’t pour the wine, but he brought it in and enough cups for everybody. His daughter had just had a baby boy. He was overwhelmed with joy, and he wanted wine. He was like, ‘I don’t want to get in trouble for this. I am going to put the wine down, and I will bring the cups out, and you do what you will with that.’ Even though I didn’t learn anything in the class, he was a nice guy. I know he works at other campuses. I hope this doesn’t follow him.”
Students were informed the following week that, after an investigation, Soto was fired, abandoning his classes just days before finals began. After multiple attempts by the Pioneer to contact Soto, he responded, but he would not comment about the incident. There are 32 students in this History of Journalism class, who are depending on getting a good grade in the class.
“We feel really bad for the students,” said Chair of the Media Arts Department Barbara Fowles. “Sandra [Mardenfeld, Director of the Journalism Program] and I are trying to fix it. I can’t talk about the details of the personnel matter, but we are going to meet with the students and work out some kind of resolution, so they can get a fair grade. That’s the main concern for me.”
Mardenfeld has taken over Soto’s Journalism 1 class for the rest of the semester.
“Like any other class I teach, my primary concern is always to give the students a positive educational experience,” said Mardenfeld. “That’s what I intend to do with this course, despite my brief tenure in it.”
The Pioneer has been informed by numerous professors contacted for comment about this incident that a gag order, an order by a court, government, or private institution, restricting information or comments from being made public, has been put in place to prevent them from speaking with the Pioneer about this incident.
The Pioneer contacted the Student Press Law Center about the gag order.  “At the college level, a place that is supposed to be all about academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas, it’s pretty damaging to be known as a haven for censorship,” said Executive Director of the Student Press Law Center Frank D. LoMonte in response to the Pioneer’s inquiry. “It makes people wonder, justifiably, what else the school is hiding. Keeping unpleasant information out of the newspaper is something we associate with North Korea or China or Libya. That’s not the company that any institution of higher education should aspire to keep. In the absence of news coverage, people are just going to indulge their imaginations and speculate, and it’s so much better for the integrity of the institution simply to get out in front of the story and deal with it honestly.”
According to Public Safety, the University recognizes that students are adults and expects them to obey the law and campus regulations. Only those of legal drinking age (21 years of age or older), may be permitted to possess or drink alcoholic beverages on campus.
“The University is investigating an incident involving alcohol that occurred in a classroom on December 1st,” said Dr. Paul Forestell, Provost of the C.W. Post Campus, in a statement released on December 7th. “The University has strict policies regarding the use of alcohol on campus and prohibits its distribution to, or use by, minors. While we are unable to discuss personnel issues regarding individual employees, we are committed to ensuring that alcohol policies are strictly enforced, as well as to meeting the educational needs of our students.”
New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Article 5 § 65-C states that it is lawful for minors to possess and taste alcoholic beverages in class when required for instructional purposes (such as a wine tasting class). This course must be licensed or registered by the state education department. A person under the age of 21 years old may also possess any alcoholic beverage with intent to consume if given by that person’s parent or guardian. Furthermore, according to the New York State Liquor Authority, one may be held liable for damage to property if it is damaged by minors who drank after alcohol was administered. That person may also be held responsible if the minor hurts himself after obtaining the alcohol.
“I was worried about my grade, but not anymore,” said a junior Broadcasting major who is in Soto’s Journalism 1 class. She asked the Pioneer not to publish her name because of concern about her final grade. “The bottle wasn’t in the class photo. He wanted a class photo just to have it. Honestly, I wasn’t offended by it, but I didn’t think it was the right thing to do, seeing as he is a grown man knowing the rules of the school. Even if we are all over age, he would have still gotten in trouble. Nobody said anything about it [when it occurred]. Nobody really hesitated to take what he was offering us.”
Following the incident, students discussed what happened on social media networks. Senior Matt Saur tweeted as NYMoot: “True just found out a journalism professor at my college brought in alcohol to class, and he was fired. Wish I was in that class =/”
“I believe that Professor Soto is a good man who just got a little carried away,” said junior Public Relations major Marisa Anziano. “He wanted to celebrate the birth of his first grandson with the class, which is a nice thought. However, he handled it in the wrong way. The whole situation made me uncomfortable, but, at the same time, he never forced anyone to drink the wine. Those who participated acted independently. It is an unfortunate circumstance, but I feel like administration handled it correctly.”

Well folks, it’s that time of year again. Everywhere you look people are starting to put out their Christmas, Hanukah, and Kwanza decorations, and the stores started bombarding us with the holidays weeks ago. Some gifts are easy to buy, like my little brother is getting some kind of remote control car/boat/helicopter, my sister is getting clothes, and the list goes on and on. But what do you get your boyfriend/girlfriend? If you have been together for a significant amount of time that may be an easy question, but what if this is a new relationship?
How much is an appropriate amount to spend? Is he/she getting something for you too? Where do you even begin? This is completely nerve-wracking. For starters, if you’re unsure if the gift giving is going both ways and don’t want to feel unprepared, perhaps you should bring it up. If you feel uncomfortable asking, stick with something small and inexpensive. I’m not saying to run to your nearest vending machine for a toy. Something like a funny tee-shirt or something with a favorite sports team on it isn’t a bad idea.
I happen to take a lot of pride in my gift-giving abilities. One of my favorite little things to give is a stocking filled with the recipients’ favorite kinds of candy. It’s very inexpensive and it’s a cute to give if you and your guy/girl aren’t too serious. I used to give one to my ex-boyfriend every year and he loved it.
It’s a tricky balancing act; you don’t want to feel stupid if the gift is not reciprocated, and you don’t want to feel awkward if he/she gets you a gift and you didn’t get one for him/her. It’s not always easy to come right out and ask if you’ll be exchanging gifts. You could always try a more subtle approach; just ask what he or she asked Santa for this year and see.

We are now almost half way through December 2011 and January 2012 is right around the corner, which of course means the election is even closer than we all think. The lead up to the Republican primary is in full swing, getting very intense, and the candidates are acting like children. Don’t you just love this time of the year?
In a recent debate in Iowa, a mini side-discussion occurred on stage between candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Perry, names we are beginning to become accustomed to hearing in connection with political mistakes. Perry questioned where Romney stood on a particular healthcare matter, and Romney told Perry he was wrong but instead of ending it, Romney did something that, in all likelihood, has rarely if ever, happened during a political election. Romney offered Perry a $10,000 bet to prove him wrong. Perry wisely did not accept, but the fact is Romney still had the guts to turn a political debate into a gambling session.
Of course there is the chance it was a joke bet, we all do that at some point, but what if it wasn’t? Let’s not kid ourselves, both candidates have enough money in their bank accounts and would have no problem coming up with the money to cover the bet. But it is the lack of professionalism involved in the matter that is of concern. Who wants a president who makes a random bet, joke or not, with another political figure just for calling his views into question.
Let’s focus on Rick Perry for just a second. He is a candidate who doesn’t need any more political mistakes during this election. He has already been known as the candidate who can’t remember his own policies, and is now one of the most hated people on YouTube. His anti-gay video had now received over 300,000 dislikes in just under 750,000 views. To put this in perspective, it crushes the older record of dislikes set by Rebecca Black for her ‘Friday’ music video, which received over 10,000,000 views and only just over 250,000 dislikes. At this point in his campaign, Perry isn’t in a position to question anything. He needs to just sit back, answer the questions he is asked, and hope for the best.
Mitt Romney, on the other hand, is a different story. He has been the front runner in the campaign for quite some time now. This event will probably change that. It is fairly upsetting to think that people who hope to be the next president of the United States of America can just make bets with one another, joke or not. While it could have been a joke, Romney seemed fairly serious in his offer, and even extended his hand to shake on the bet. He did so with a smile on his face that seemed like he knew he caught Perry in yet another embarrassing moment. I, however, think the joke is on him. In an economic crisis, the only time the people want to hear a candidate throwing that kind of money around is if he is donating it to the debt crisis.
Yet another mistake made by a Republican candidate as we get yet another week closer to the primary. At this point it is anyone’s guess as to who will really take the primary, but if all of them keep messing up, I think it is clear who will win in 2012. So to all the Republican candidates out there, here is a bit of advice. Focus on the people and the election, not on humiliating yourselves or your competition. It will only hurt you in the end.

Here’s a scenario: it’s the last week of classes and finals are approaching. A student in your class turns to you and says, “Do you have the notes for the class and what is the final on?” You can’t help but think this student has lost his mind and it is clear that he  hasn’t paid any attention throughout the whole semester. So you ask yourself, “Is it my responsibility to help this student?
Most people can agree that when it gets to the end of the semester, everyone is mentally and physically exhausted. It seems students have more papers to write and tests to study for than in the beginning of the semester. However, if students are studying hard and giving it their all before the semester ends, it is not fair, nor is it right, to give other students the east way out.
Emily Anker, senior Business Management major said, “I think it is very funny, but annoying at the same time, when a student in a classroom has been there and doesn’t pay attention. When a test comes, they ask for study sheets for the answers when they should be the ones doing the work in the first place. Depending on the excuse the person gives, I personally would not help them out because they are lazy and their grade must reflect upon them, not me.”
Keith Apfel, senior Psychology major and Criminal Justice minor added, “One time, someone on the last day of class asked me for all the notes. I gave them to him because I felt bad. This student was never in class, but if it happened to me again, I wouldn’t give someone my notes because they are old enough to be in college and it is not my responsibility.”
Chelsea Serra, sophomore Environmental Science major said, “I have never had a student ask me for notes for a final, but students have asked me for the answers for a test. I didn’t give them the answers because they need to do the work themselves. They shouldn’t bother other people so they can get an A for the class too. I feel people procrastinate to the point where it’s too late to even start studying, but if they actually did their work on time, they wouldn’t be desperate to ask others for the answers.”
“In some of my classes, people have asked to borrow my notes,” said Samantha Osgood, a junior Sociology major, “I don’t feel bad for them when they are sleeping in class and I am working hard. When they ask, I just say no. It’s different, if they actually need help and don’t understand something, then I will give my notes. ”
It is clear most students do not feel comfortable giving away their notes to others who are, let’s just say plain out, lazy. At this age, people should start acting like college students and do the work on their own, not rely on others for a good grade. What you put in is what you are going to get out. Students should realize they are not always going to get lucky and get something handed to them. It might actually be a good feeling if they did the work on their own, which would result in getting a good grade.

Many of us have been in some of these situations:  the class you wish to sign up for is cancelled due to lack of enrollment and now you need a new one; you have apparently been taking the wrong classes and now can’t graduate on tim; or you need one more class to graduate and you never even knew it existed and can’t graduate until next semester. This trend has been growing on campus lately, but why?
For those of you who are new to the campus, a few years ago students used to have to meet with academic advisors personally to register for their next semester classes. Their advisors would let them know what classes to take and when, so they could graduate on time, and then just register for them without any problem. But this is the age of technology and making things simple. To make the lives of the advisors a little easier and less stressful, and so that students have a little more control over what classes to take, everything went electronic in 2009 and now we register online, on our own, every semester.
But how much easier is it really? Now that it’s up to the students to register themselves for classes, make sure they clarify their course load with their advisors, and to make sure they are on top of all their requirements, students have a few choices. One is to make sure to meet with their advisors prior to the registration date and check that they are planning to take the right classes. The second option is to just wing it. This could lead to an increase in the number of students forgetting about a class they need to take, and an increase in students being held back from graduation for a semester.
Well, not everything is the fault of technology. A lot of students register for the right class, and then two weeks before the class is set to begin they get a call saying that it has been cancelled since not enough people registered for it. This causes a major issue because a lot of those classes are mandatory for people’s majors and now need to be pushed back to a different semester. In many cases an alternative can be provided but if it can’t, those people can’t graduate on time if it is during their senior year and it is the only class left they need to take.
While it is true that it is easier to register online by ourselves, it may not be practical due to some of the complications that come with it. Would it solve the problem if we switched back to the old ways? Hard to tell, but we do know the new way has some flaws and difficulties.

Danny Schrafel
Former Editor-in Chief
 
I’m a history nerd.  Then again, to those of you who know me well, that comes as little surprise.
Many a deadline night, I amused myself by jumping into the archives and pulling out random Pioneers newspapers from yesteryear – the first edition after Hillwood Commons opened; anything with the classic Conestoga wagon masthead, a report on Hurricane Gloria that came out the day I was born (Oct. 9, 1985 for those of you keeping score at home), the infamous O.J. Simpson headline, “The Juice Is Loose,” and the list goes on. I also proved something Stephanie Koithan, who now works with Rita Langdon after a stellar run as our features editor, frequently said – “I love you Danny, but you have the attention span of a gnat.”
Here’s the point – when I was asked to contribute in some way to the Pioneer’s 55th edition, I felt flattered and a bit duty-bound. After all, the Pioneer changed my life, and I am forever grateful. Now, here’s the obligatory “Golden Girls” reference (with apologies to the late, great Estelle Getty).
Picture it – Brookville, the fall of 2003. A not-quite 18-year-old, slightly frightened (and much slimmer) history education major arrives on the campus of C.W. Post, eager to begin a new chapter in his life. He has his books, he has his class schedule, and he has his gym clothes for a lunchtime workout at the Pratt Center. The only thing he doesn’t have? Professors.
Yes, friends, much like you did this fall, I arrived to the joyous spectacle of a faculty strike. Professors on the picket line, big American flags at the front gate, the whole lot. Both of my courses for the day bit the dust accordingly, and with little homework to speak of, I wanted something to do with myself. I saw a flier announcing the Pioneer’s first meeting for 2003 and decided to head upstairs and see what was happening. Plus, the free pizza sounded ducky, too.
As it turns out, those professors did me a favor. They gave me a chance to discover something that I would ultimately fall in love with.
If you’re wondering, a college newspaper office is a really, really good place to be when there’s a strike on campus. News is happening, and it’s coming to life before your eyes. And I quickly made friends. One of the editors was an orientation leader I remembered from the summer, and I kind of hung out with her for the first few months at the newspaper, doing odd jobs, picking up a story here and there and learning the basics. I laid out the classified ads for a whole semester on a computer that was so awful and temperamental that we named it “666.” I hear the new computers are much nicer.
As time went on, I got more involved in the Pioneer. I picked up a column and wrote about gay and lesbian issues from the eyes of a college student (note to future authors – if you do such a thing, and I hope someone does, come out to your parents first. It’s good for your blood pressure); started getting more involved with news reporting, became the advertising manager, got promoted to managing editor and was finally voted in as editor-in-chief, which I did for three wonderful years until I graduated in 2008.
All the while, a funny thing happened – I started falling in love with journalism. Initially, I swore I was going to be a history teacher, with this funny little writing thing as a hobby. Then, my plans were to be a history teacher who would do freelance writing on the side. About two years in, I took a journalism minor along with my history education major and started wondering – “Could I do this for a living?” Ultimately, I got the confidence I needed to switch majors, and taking that leap was one of the best things I ever did for myself.
I’ve been working for Long Islander Newspapers in Huntington since the summer of 2008, and I’m frequently reminded why journalism is my calling. Not only do I interact with fascinating, important people every day, I’m able to provide a public service by collecting and disseminating information, keeping politicians on their toes and giving a voice to people who are being abused or neglected by the system, their neighbors, whoever it is. And for me, a kid who got bullied a whole lot from third to ninth grade and spent more than a few moments wishing I wouldn’t wake up the next morning, that’s a wonderful privilege to now have.
I owe the Pioneer a whole lot – for the friends I made, the career track it set me on and the experiences that prepared me well for working in the “real world.” I don’t regret a bit of it – even the heinous Tuesday night production marathons – and I hope each of you have the same good fortune I enjoyed during my time here.

We have all been there at least once, holiday time rushing in and you can’t think of a single place to take your significant other. You’re on a budget, you don’t know where to go, and you have a week to figure it out. Ready, go!
For some, this is easier said than done, but for most of us every year we struggle with this dilemma. Well as difficult as the question seems to be, it is actually quite simple. There are tons of places that you can bring your boyfriends or girlfriends that are simple, close, and in many cases, inexpensive.
The first place you can go is into New York City. Now most people are probably thinking “but that is so expensive!” True, it can be at times, but it doesn’t have to be. Hop on a train to the city, $8.25 for a one-way, off-peak ticket, leaving from Hicksville train station, and end up in Penn Station and just a few blocks away from the holiday epicenter of New York: Times Square. Walk around Times Square and window shop for a while, no need to buy if you can’t, but it can be fun just to look in stores and admire a few things. If you see something you really like, pick it up for you or your significant other. Then head on up just a few blocks to Rockefeller Center, on 50th Street between 6th and 7thAvenues, and go see the tree. This is perfect for that little bit of romance you may be looking for. There are also a ton of inexpensive restaurants all over the city for you to stop into and have a nice dinner together. If you want to spend a little more while in the city, check out the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. It is a fun show for everyone and tickets start as low as $45. You can also look into Broadway shows. Check the paper for what shows are playing and read a few reviews on what’s good and what may interest you.
What about those who don’t want to deal with the cold or do too much traveling? Luckily, we attend a school that is close to a ton of places that are fun, inexpensive, and will really impress your special person. For those just trying to keep it simple, for those who have not been dating to long, or for anyone who just wants to have a good time, try ice skating. Conveniently, there are several places to go ice skating right in Nassau County. Roslyn, Massapequa, and East Meadow are all very close and all have ice skating available to the public. A small dinner out can say a lot; even just a movie date can say a lot, if done the right way.
Now for those of you who have been able to save up a little bit of money and want to do something extra special for the holidays, there are places for you as well. A nice dinner is always a good idea. Places like the Cheesecake Factory or the Grand Lux Café are great places to consider. They have good food, nice atmosphere, and even though they are a little more expensive than McDonalds or Applebees, the meal won’t cost you several hundred dollars. A whole meal at the Cheesecake Factory, including deserts and appetizers, may be approximately $75-$125, depending on the price of what you order.
For those of you who have your own kitchen area, a simple, candle-lit, homemade dinner says a thousand and one words. No matter what you decide on, as long as you enjoy it, you have made the right choice.

With less than two weeks left of the semester, and December 21st just around the corner, we can soon celebrate our winter break. Traveling, working, studying, and relaxing – this is what some of the C.W Post students plan to do for their break.
Sophomore International Business student, Julia Sundström Sandström, from Sweden, will visit Veribier, in Switzerland, for nearly a month of skiing in the Alps and work as a ski instructor. “My family is joining me over Christmas, and we will celebrate a regular Swedish Christmas in our apartment,” she said.
Lauren King, a senior Education major, will spend her winter break at home. She will be celebrating Christmas together with her whole family, sharing a huge home-made meal. Other than that, she is undecided about whether she will be working, going to school, or traveling upstate for a family visit. “I may be taking a winter class so I can catch up on credits, because I have switched my major a few times,” she said.
Graduate student, Dora Bioic, is about to finish her M.B.A. program in Business. She will fly back home to Croatia for the break. “I haven´t been home for Christmas in over three years, so I am super-excited,” she said.  “I will spend some quality time with my loved ones, eat some amazing food, and have fun!” Spending Christmas with her family and friends, her plan is to relax and enjoy some skiing, rather than working, although she will be looking for an internship for next semester. Other than that, she explained, “I will just go with the flow and enjoy every moment I can.”
Esther Birkeland is a junior Vocal Performance major heading back to Norway for her winter break. “I´m going to celebrate Christmas on the night of the 24th as we always do, with my family, grandparents, and my awesome nephew Samuel,” she said. She will work at her uncle´s grocery store while she is home, and is also hoping to have several vocal performances over the break. “My plans for this break are to relax, spend time with my family and friends, work, and just enjoy being home again,” she said.
Bas Beverwijk, from Holland, is currently studying for his Master’s in Public Administration. He will also spend his winter break back home: “I will arrive on Christmas evening, so hopefully somebody has missed me enough to pick me up from the airport,” he said. He is planning to spend time with family and friends, and might also be traveling to visit family in Switzerland. Before he flies back to New York, he will find time for a little vacation on a Caribbean Island: “I will stop for a five-day holiday on Curacao, where my cousin is doing an internship,” he said.

Holiday season is a great time of year for many reasons.  It is the perfect time to curl up on the couch with a nice cup of hot chocolate and watch a Christmas movie or maybe listen to some Christmas music.  An entertaining, classic Christmas movie that is filled with laughter is Elf .The movie is about Buddy the Elf’s journey into New York City to try to find his father.  Since Buddy lived in the North Pole his entire life, he is out of the loop on reality.  Will Ferrell will have you laughing for the majority of the movie.
Another must-see this holiday season is A Christmas Story. The little boy’s mission in order to get his BB gun that he wants for Christmas is a pleasurable one;  this movie is definitely a classic.
Bad Santa, (not a kid’s movie) is my personal favorite.  Billy Bob Thornton plays a miserable, alcoholic Santa Claus, who robs department stores with his little elf friend.  If you are looking to have a great laugh, the extremes that this Santa goes to will absolutely entertain you.
Great family Christmas movies to watch are The Santa Claus, starring Tim Allen, National Lampoon’s Christmas with Chevy Chase, and Miracle on 34th Street.  Jillian Roth, a junior majoring in Psychology said, “Christmas is my favorite time of the year with all of the decorations and lights.  The movies also add to the magic.  My favorite movie is Miracle on 34th Street.  My favorite part is the end when the little girl gets her dream house and family.  It gives children the chance to believe and hope in magic.”
Another way to get into the holiday spirit is by listening to festive music.  Most of the Christmas movies have soundtracks to go along with them.  Chevy Chase’s Christmas Vacation features the holiday song, “Mele Kalikimaka,” by Bing Crosby.  This is a fun festive song that will put you in a cheerful mood just from listening to it.  Mariah Carey’s, “All I Want for Christmas” is you, is one of my personal favorites. Every year around this time, I play the song over and over.  Another great holiday song is “Christmas Time” by Backstreet Boys.  Nsync also has a Christmas album called “Home for Christmas”.  A popular song featured on the album is “Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays”.  Jessica Simpson’s holiday album, “Rejoice”, and Destiny Child’s, “8 Days of Christmas” are also fun albums that are great for the whole family!
Kyle Bossio, a junior Political Science major, has a few favorite Christmas songs.  Some songs that he plays every year are, “I’ll be home for Christmas” by Blink 182, “Exmiss” by New Found Glory, “Wishlist” by The Ready Set, and “Maybe This Christmas” by For All Those Sleeping.
Since the holidays only come once a year, make this season a great one. Watch fun holiday movies you have never seen before.  Listen to familiar holiday music.  Many radio stations have holiday music playing throughout the day, and there are always holiday movies on television.  Happy Holidays!

It’s that time again; time to take into account the events of the past year. There are so many trends, songs, books, movies, and of course, so much news, to keep up with on a day-to-day basis.  Let’s reflect on some of the best things that  happened in 2011.
According to Yahoo, the most searched man was Robert Pattinson, not so surprising, and Jennifer Aniston was the most searched female. E! has a list of top celebrity news including the royal wedding, Charlie Sheen’s meltdown, Schwarzenegger’s love child, and the Kim Kardashian wedding/divorce. Forbes has named Lady Gaga number one on its top celebrity list followed by Oprah, Justin Beiber, U2, and Elton John.
Billboard has named Adele the top artist of 2011. She managed to have two hit singles Rolling in the Deep and Someone Like You from one album. Adele has recently been nominated for six Grammy Awards in the categories of album of the year, best pop vocal album for 21, record of the year, song of the year, best short form music video for Rolling in the Deep, and best pop solo performance for Someone Like You. Following Adele on Billboard’s list of top artists were:
2. Rihanna
3. Katy Perry
4. Lady Gaga
5. Nicki Minaj
6. Taylor Swift
7. Justin Bieber
8. Chris Brown
9. Lil Wayne
10. Bruno Mars
As for flicks, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 came in at number one at the box office, grossing over $ 380 million, Transformers: Dark of the Moon came in at number two with just over $ 350 million grossed, and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 came in third with just under $ 300 million. The Hangover Part II and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides finished out the top five.
In my research, I came across something I found to be quite intriguing. AOL took a poll from its users and came up with “11 Days That Shaped 2011,” http://11in2011.aol.com/. January 8, the Arizona shooting, 19 people were shot and six died; January 25, the start of the Arab Spring; March 1, Charlie Sheen’s “Winning” over 18,000 re-tweets; March 11, the earthquake that hit Japan, caused a 23’ tsunami and resulted in over 22,000 people reported dead or missing; April 29, Prince William married Kate Middleton, 23 million Americans watched; May 1, Osama bin Laden is killed; May 25, Oprah’s last show after 25 years on-air; August 2, the debt ceiling crisis; September 11, the ten-year anniversary of 9/11; September 17, Occupy Wall Street began, 20,000 people “flood” Manhattan; October 5, Steve Jobs died.
The same could be said for any year, but 2011 has really been world-altering. The U.S. broke its record for natural disasters, having 12, the fate of the Arab world is entirely unknown, and the world is facing a debt crisis. Dust off your resolutions, it seems that 2012 has the potential to be just as interesting and equivocal as 2011.

Ashley DeShields
Music has been a part of people’s lives for almost as long as people have been on this earth. It conveys our happiness, our sadness, our anger, and other emotions in between. There is also music for every occasion, including birthdays, funerals, and weddings. As we have evolved, so has our ability to take music wherever we go, from the giant phonograph to the miniscule i-Pod shuffle. People turn to music to block out background noise, and to keep themselves focused.
The most common sight when at the gym or with people who run is the wire running up to someone’s ears. Listening to music when running can help people keep their pace and train for different events. Some students shared with the Pioneer their favorite songs and artists to listen to when they work out. M.P.A. student Bas Beverwijk,  who is from Holland, said his favorites are “Dj Chuckie – Dirty Dutch remix and Swedish house mafia”. It’s easy to understand why the song is upbeat and perfect for running and keeping one energized. Nick Conte, an Art Therapy major, said that his favorite artists when he is working out are “Disturbed, Headstrong, and Linkin Park. I generally like rock music and I generally find myself listening to these artists the most when I am at the gym. I set my pace to the beat of the song and I am able to keep myself focused.”
Not all the music one listens to has to be super up-beat, it can be a calmer pace. Jess Singh, an English Education major, said “my favorite tunes are Esclavo De Sus Besos by David Bisbal, Stereo Love by Edward Maya and Waving Flag by K’naan.”
When it comes to homework, there are really two options that will work – instrumental music or no music at all. Those who choose to listen to music when they study or do homework are using it to block out outside noise and distractions. Just because you are studying in the library doesn’t mean it is quiet. Nick Conte listens to “Beethoven, 90’s vitamin music, and other instrumentals.” Ashley Staib chooses “Generally classical or instrumental jazz, no particular song or artist. I need to listen to songs without words because otherwise I can’t concentrate and I tend to sing along.” Some people are better able to block out noise and distractions because listening to music comes at a cost.  Singh said “I don’t listen to music when I’m studying since it has been shown to decrease your retention overall.”
If you aren’t into listening to Beethoven or classical music, try movie soundtracks that are all instrumental, such as the Lord of the Rings, Inception, Harry Potter, Tron Legacy, or Pirates of the Caribbean.
Since it’s the holiday season, these students also provided their favorite songs for this time of year.  Beverwijk’s favorite is a throwback from the past –  “Santa is coming to town, by the Jackson 5; the King of pop before he went solo, without a doubt a classic that can do no wrong.” Conte chose an edgier side to the holiday season with the “‘Carole of the Bells Rock’ remix and the oh, so hilarious Adam Sandler’s ‘Hanukah Song.’” Some may find the second song crude, but you will get a lot of laughs out of it, as it goes against the grain of the stereotypical holiday songs. Finally, Staib loves the timeless and powerful voice of Mariah Carey for her holiday selection, with selections such as “All I want for Christmas is You”, “Oh Santa”, and “Oh Holy Night.”
Everyone should check out these songs. You may find a new favorite and also see that you are not so different from your fellow students, regardless of whether you know them or not.

Marijuana, also known as cannibis, is the most widely used illicit substance in the world, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). Marijuana consists of flowers, leaves, and stalks of mature pistillate female plants. It is used as a psychoactive drug, and also for medical purposes, but students may also abuse this substance to get high from the chemical compound called THC.
According to a survey of students in 8th to 12th grades that was performed in 2009 by NIDA, 16.7 million Americans aged 12 and over were using marijuana once a month. These numbers have been proven to only increase throughout the years.
The questions now to ask are, “Should marijuana be legalized in New York and should it be used for appropriate health purposes?” This has become a controversial subject throughout the years. In fact, according to Medicalmarijuana.procon.org, the following states have enacted laws to legalize medical marijuana. These include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Washington D.C., Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. In addition, each state has a possession limit, meaning a person in that state is only able to have a certain amount of usable ounces. For example, California allows eight ounces, which is 18 plants. Interestingly enough, 8 of the 10 states that legalized marijuana by 2006 have seen a decrease in teen use from 1999-2006, according to Medicalmarijuana.procon.org.
Most people can readily agree that as you get older, you do and try things, when you know you shouldn’t be doing them in the first place. This is very true on the subject of marijuana. Due to the fact that it is not legalized in New York, this influences more teens to try this substance because the fact that it is “illegal” persuades them to rebel. This is one of the reasons why students and/or teens smoke marijuana. It becomes fun and exciting when they do something they know they shouldn’t be doing
And of course, there are always pros and cons to anything in life. In this example, marijuana poses some positive effects. Marijuana may be used for medical purposes to relieve pain, control nausea, stimulate appetite, and decrease ocular pressure, according to NIDA.  It has been found to cure ailments such as nausea from chemotherapy, lower eye pressure in patients with glaucoma, and relieve symptoms or help treat multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, HIV, migraines, seizures, insomnia, depression, and anorexia, according to Medical Marijuana cure.  However, NIDA also reports that marijuana can cause adverse effects such as hallucinations, disorientations, and sometimes feelings of anxiety. In a study conducted in 2007 by safechoice.org comparing drugs such as alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, heroin, caffeine and marijuana, marijuana scored the lowest in terms of withdrawal, tolerance, reinforcement, and dependence.
In a New York Times article on June 27, 2011, it was reported that a woman named Terry Nelson from Texas, gave another reason for the legalization of marijuana. According to the article, Nelson said that cartel members make 60% of their profit from selling illegal marijuana. Legalizing it will cause the cartel business to not make as much money, which may help will end the cycle and bring the cartel leaders to justice.
A Post senior Business Management major, who chooses not to have her name mentioned said, “I don’t think marijuana should be legalized. I have come to my dorm building numerous times with my parents and they have smelled marijuana. This is not only embarrassing, but legalizing it would cause students to take advantage of this.”
Jazlyn Beltre, junior Journalism major, said, “Marijuana should actually be legalized in New York and other places too. Less people would be smoking marijuana if it were legal because it would take out the fun of doing something that is forbidden. I personally think from experience that drinking is more dangerous than marijuana, which is something that is natural. The THC comes from the plant and from the earth. Alcohol can lead to liver failure or to drinking and driving.” Beltre added, “First of all, some parents smoke marijuana when they are wrong (to do so) and tell their children not to.  The media compares marijuana to cocaine, dope, and crack. Meanwhile, they are all manmade and THC gets you high. The long-term effects of marijuana are not as dangerous. Any type of drug can be abused, but marijuana would be a middle point, between sobriety and complete intoxication. Even though it can be addictive, so are Tylenol, Nyquil, and pills sold over the counter. I don’t think people should abuse it, but it should be available for the people who need it medically.”
Bryan Smith, Assistant Director of Admissions said, “I think that younger people who engage in that type of behavior do so because they see it as a social norm amongst their peers. In the long run, in most cases, I believe it has negative consequences in terms of an individual’s health, academics, and over all well-being.”
The problem with marijuana today is people need to realize it can lead to misuse and abuse. Legalizing marijuana may also trigger pressure to experiment with other drugs. People are thrill seekers. Anything you put in your body can be harmful, whether it is a drug or even an unhealthy food. However, it all comes down to our society wanting to do something that’s prohibited or trying something to “fit in.” It seems the debate over legalizing marijuana in New York is causing more problems than it solves.

By next Thursday, many of Post’s dormers will be traveling home. Some aren’t driving, but going overseas to Europe and Asia. Unfortunately, there isn’t a sleigh or flying car to take you overseas, but here are  a few tips on how to get through road traffic and what to avoid when driving.
For those of us on Long Island who dorm, the best way to get home in the Nassau area is to take those dreaded sidestreets. I really don’t advise any highway driving during the holidays, and since you’re not traveling for hours, suck it up and take the sidestreets. Northern Boulevard is a decent road to travel.  Route 106/107 is a bit dangerous, but it’s fast and easy to maneuver. Hempstead Turnpike is, in my opinion, one of the worst roads on Long Island next to Old Country Road, but there’s not too much traffic on it during the day; it’s only during rush hours that you should  not use it. So avoid driving until after 10 a.m. (which I’m sure won’t be a problem) and from 4:00-7:00 pm.
As far as highways are concerned, the best thing to do if you don’t have a car at school, is to have the ‘rents pick you up and take the L.I.E. home and travel in the greatest invention in the world, the HOV lane.  I would avoid the Northern State and its two lanes; the Southern State literally has traffic 24/7 as well; the Meadowbrook will have all the shoppers; and the Parkway most likely will be packed for a few exits. Other than that, you should be golden on any other highway.
For those traveling into the dreaded city, I would be prepared for a slow trip ahead. Definitely avoid the rush hour times, but there might be traffic that can’t be avoided during other times as well. Wait it out as patiently as you can. If you can avoid the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, the Cross-Bronx Expressway, and the George Washington Bridge, then you shouldn’t go through too much traffic. If you can’t avoid them, check your radio and see how the traffic is moving at the time. If it’s not, use the bathroom before you leave, have enough gas and snacks, and call a friend (using a blue-tooth of course!) and prepare for the trip ahead.
For those of us who commute to school on a daily basis, be prepared, the week before Christmas is literally the worst week when it comes to driving. Every road near a mall will be jammed-packed with cars trying to get in and out at all times of the day. If you want to go out to eat, think again, restaurants will be packed with shoppers kicking back and relaxing. They’re like a disease. I would just stay local, or if you really need to go to the city or Queens, take public transit and avoid the tourists and shoppers who will be circulating out of the malls.
I want to wish everybody wonderful and happy holidays and a very happy new year. Good luck on final exams and projects, and I hope your grades are good enough to show and brag to your parents about. Have fun this break until you come back and do it all over again. Until next time, safe driving everybody!

We all have those people in our lives who take being festive during the holiday season a little too seriously: someone with that hideous Christmas sweater with embroidered reindeer and candy canes that has been picked out for months; someone whose signature red Santa hat is made of a premiere crushed velvet and the white fur-trimmed brim lights up in 10-second intervals; someone whose car has reindeer antlers and a red nose; someone else whose  dog is dressed like an elf from December 1st  until January 2nd; and they’ve all been singing holiday tunes since the day after Halloween.
Now, I am all for decking the halls and being jolly. However, I am not so sure I can rock an itchy Christmas sweater for any occasion other than an Ugly Christmas Sweater party. For those of you who are like me, or those of you who have had a festive intervention, I am here to help you survive this holiday season with plenty of merriment and style as well.
First, pack up your ugly Christmas sweaters in a box and shove them all the way to the back of your closet. If your sweater has ice-skating penguins wearing Santa costumes, perfectly wrapped presents, or any translation of holiday lore, I am talking to you. Ironically, if it is worn to an Ugly Christmas Sweater party, then there is no sweater too ridiculous. If planning to wear one seriously, may I suggest instead a nice plain forest-green or Kelly-green v-neck pullover sweater, a pair of dressy jeans, and nice flats.
Second, any sort of antler hat, or headband should be reserved for holiday parties and the actual day of the holiday only. Putting on a pair of cute reindeer antlers and a little black dress, pumps, and a simple cardigan is a great way to marry fashion and the holiday spirit. Dressing up like Santa every day, unless you work as one in a mall, is a terrible idea. Remember: less is more.
Third, festive jewelry is a great way to make a holiday statement. I picked up from Target a fabulous dark red ring in the shape of a bow that you stick on a present. I cannot wait to wear it on Christmas Eve! Jewelry is the best way to showcase how jolly you truly are. My aunt is the queen of holiday brooches and pins. Take a cue from her and find a nice wreath, tree, or some other jubilant pin to add to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.
Fourth, the more sparkles the better. Adding a dose of sequins or sparkles into your holiday ensemble is like an instant holiday boost. Sequined pumps or flats, headbands, cardigans, or even tops can enhance your cheery holiday spirit. It is immediately recognizable as a special occasion or holiday outfit.
“For the holidays, it really depends on where I am going. I’m not going to wear 4-inch heels just to sit in my aunt’s kitchen, but I would probably dress nicer than I would on a regular day, ” says Brittany Colasanto, senior Art Therapy major.
Senior Business Management major Megan Hallquest says: “I love everything about the holidays. I am the type of person who is in the holiday spirit from December 1st to January 1st. I do not think you can ever go overboard with Christmas and holiday gear. Everything looks so good! I do love dressing up because you can never be too festive.”
The holiday season is all about family, having fun, giving, and being grateful for what you have. As always, if you want to wear the craziest Christmas sweater known to man, wear it! By all means, if you are confident and jovial like Santa, then I implore you to wear your best holiday garb. It is people like you who make this season, and theworld in general, a brighter and happier  place.
No matter what you wear this holiday season, remember to have fun and enjoy. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

“New Year’s Eve” is a movie that came out this past weekend, and I can say that I sincerely enjoyed. As many of you know, this movie was directed by Gary Marshall and is a sequel to “Valentines Day”, which came out in 2010 and was also directed by Gary Marshall.
Even though there is a new plot to the story, it still shares the same format from “Valentines Day.” All of the characters, even though they are very different and are living in different parts of New York City, are connected in some way. Throughout the movie, we see how everyone is connected, and it really shocks you to see this and to see who is connected. The entire movie takes place six hours before midnight on New Year’s Eve, and the audience sees what every different character goes through.
Another thing this movie has is a full cast of very well known celebrities, such as Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Zac Efron, Halle Berry, Hilary Swank, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Jessica Biel; the list is actually quite long. This movie is perfect for this time of year; with Christmas quickly approaching next week, it still has the holiday spirit element to it and also gets you excited for all the New Year’s celebrations.
I recommend this movie because it genuinely makes you laugh a lot, and it also has parts that make you cry. You can see this movie with your family or friends, or even on a date, but, trust me, you wont be disappointed.

Recently, A&E introduced a new special about the 10 bodies that have been found near the Oak Beach community on Long Island. The case has caught national attention and, for over a year, has been investigated by the Suffolk County Police Department. Today, the case is cold, and there are no suspects; it’s a mystery in every sense of the word. The documentary relied all the latest findings and information as of today and theories on whom the killer could be. It has become fact that it is only one killer and not many, as suggested earlier this year. According to the documentary, the person started killing years before; the first victim is suspected to be a woman, known as a prostitute, as well as an infant that was found next to her and believed to be her child. The male body the police also found was believed to have been involved in prostitution as well. Years later, the killer went online to Craigslist to find victims, which soon added up to the 10 bodies that police have found. The killer, so far, remains at large.
The documentary itself was very well done. Many more of the victims’ lives were revealed and a lot of misconceptions and confusions in the case were cleared up. The special shows just how dangerous the dating escorts and sites like Craigslist really are. (It was also said because a lot of the females got sucked up into the business of the online sex trade.) The Internet has made the business much more underground than it ever was and also extremely hard for police to track. It was also revealed that it took months for police to allow these women to be on missing persons databases. There is some discrimination and lack of regard for missing women who are labeled as prostitutes, which is a really terrible thought that police allowed families to remain scared and fearful about their loved ones. The killer was said to be smart, bold, and knows how to leave a murder scene without leaving a single piece of physical evidence. The police had almost nothing to work on in the case.
Overall, it’s a great documentary that I highly recommend watching when it’s on A&E, especially if you’re a fan of mysteries.

Justin Bieber
“Under the Mistletoe”
 
 By Olivia Wicik
The holiday season is finally here, and for the music industry, this means that every artist comes out with his own version of classic (usually, already been done) seasonal songs. I always hear these songs on the radio and when I’m out shopping but never really make a point to go home and download the music. However, when I heard Justin Bieber’s take on holiday music, I was kind of impressed. As someone who is not exactly considered a “belieber,” I really thought the 17-year-old put together an interesting holiday album. He personally co-wrote many of the songs and included such a wide range of genres that “Under the Mistletoe” is truly appealing to so many audiences.
Personally, I love country music, and when I saw that Bieber collaborated with The Band Perry (which sings, “If I Die Young”) on one of the songs, I was instantly hooked. The whole album just has such a “different” feeling than most other holiday albums do. It is not all slow songs; many of them are upbeat and fun, including collaborations with various artists. A fun song that he included is “Drummer Boy,” featuring Busta Rhymes. It is fast paced and a fun spinoff of the classic song that we all listened to as children. Bieber and Busta Rhymes both have rapping parts that are really amusing, but the song still gives you that “Christmastime” feeling. Other artists that are featured on the album are Usher, Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey.
If you’re looking for a different, fun album that features all your favorite holiday songs, I would definitely suggest picking this one up. My favorite song would have to be “Home this Christmas,” featuring The Band Perry, but all of them are amusing to listen to and will absolutely get you into the holiday spirit! This is also a great stocking stuffer or secret-santa gift. Happy Holidays!

“The Big Bang Theory”
CBS
“Our whole universe was in a hot dense state” until Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), and Penny (Kaley Cuoco) became neighbors. Leonard and Sheldon are scientists who work at the California Institute of Technology along with friends Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Rajesh Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar). Penny is an aspiring actress who has picked up a waitressing gig at the Cheesecake Factory. Leonard has had a crush on Penny since the day she moved in across the hall. Penny always seems to date the wrong guy or screws it up when she is dating the right guy. By the way, they both briefly dated, so there is still some sexual lust between them. Howard, who still lives with his mom, is engaged to Bernadette Rostenkowski (Melissa Rauch) a doctor. Meanwhile, Sheldon, who is very difficult to deal with, is dating Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), a scientist like himself, who is awkward when it comes to socializing. Raj lives alone but always shows up to Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment to hang out.
Now in its fifth season, “The Big Bang Theory” divides its time between the male and female characters as they tackle similar problems in completely different ways. When launched in 2007, the show mainly followed Leonard, Sheldon and Penny. It has slowly developed into an ensemble comedy, allowing for all of the characters to interact and grow with one another. With this change, it has become funnier and more appealing as there is more that one can identify with. Most of the characters as so bizarre and unusual; you can’t help being drawn to the screen. Sheldon doesn’t understand sarcasm; Amy taught a monkey to smoke cigarettes, and the male characters are avid sci-fi fans and memorabilia collectors, while the females love to shop.
“The Big Bang Theory” airs on CBS Thursdays at 8 .pm. It has been renewed through the 2013-2014 season.

The C.W. Post Pioneers women’s basketball team lost two straight games this past week, putting them in the middle of a three-game losing streak. The Pioneers lost 76-74 in overtime to the NYIT Bears on Tuesday, December 6th, followed by a 65-62 loss to the Pace University Setters on Friday, December 9th.
The two losses have pushed the Pioneers’ record to 5-4 overall and 0-2 in conference play.
In the loss to the NYIT Bears, the Pioneers shot 43.7 percent (31-71) from field goal range and 26.7 percent (4-15) from three-point range. Junior forward Nicolette Marciniak and senior guard Felicia Joyner both led the team with 20 points. Joyner added four assists and three steals.
A late 9-2 run in the second half by the Bears tied the game at 62. The tying shot came off a free throw made by NYIT’s Cierra Baker. She led the Bears with 26 points, while contributing 14 rebounds, six assists and five steals.
The Pioneers regained the lead and with 14 seconds left in the game; Marciniak made one of two free throws to put her team ahead by two points. With six seconds left, junior center Samantha Kopp was charged with a foul, sending Baker to the free throw line. Baker made both shots and sent the game to overtime.
Overtime was a close matchup with both teams trading the lead. The Bears’ junior guard Rebecca Lynch put the dagger in the Pioneers with a shot made late in overtime, putting the Bears ahead by four points with only a couple seconds left in the game.  The Bears won with a score of 76-74.
Friday brought another tough loss for the Pioneers, this time against the Pace University Setters.  The Pioneers fell behind early, trailing 6-0 two minutes into the game. The Setters maintained their lead, and, at one point, were leading by 11 points. The Pioneers went on an 11-0 run and cut it to a 27-25 lead with 5:43 left in the half.  That was the closest the Pioneers came in the first half to tying the game. They ended the half trailing 41-36.
The Pioneers chipped away at the lead and eventually tied the game early in the second half. Marciniak gave the Pioneers their first lead of the game with 12:56 left. The Setters’ Carol Johnson tied the game at 49 with a layup. The Pioneers regained their lead, taking a 56-50 lead with 4:35 left in the game.
Pace University managed to claw back and recapture the lead. Joyner hit two free throws to cut that lead to a 61-60 Setters advantage. Setters’ junior guard Allison Cleary hit a jump shot to give her team a three-point cushion. Joyner made a layup on the next Pioneers’ possession to make it a one-point game once more. Pioneers’ sophomore guard Kenyatta Sears was forced to foul senior forward Javadifar Maral with two seconds left in the game. Maral hit both free throws to make it 65-62 and secure the win for the Setters.
Joyner led the Pioneers with 21 points in the game. Lutz was behind her, contributing 18 points of her own.
The next game for the Pioneers is on Friday, December 16th, at 6 p.m. against Saint Thomas of Aquinas.
