Mercy College filed a lawsuit in the Westchester Supreme Court against Long Island University and Edward Weis, LIU’s new Vice President of Academic Affairs, on August 13.
In the complaint, Mercy College claims that Weis and LIU committed a “breach of the duty of loyalty, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with contract, misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information, unfair competition and injunctive relief,” resulting in damages of $700,000 to Mercy College in scholarship money and other expenses. Weis and LIU have denied the allegations in the lawsuit.
LIU’s president Kimberly Cline was president of Mercy College from 2008 to 2013, prior to joining LIU in July 2013.
Weis, who left Mercy in May and joined LIU in June, is accused in the complaint of using his connections while he was dean of the Mercy College School of Business to forward information to promising first-year students of Mercy College and students involved in Mercy’s summer program to encourage them to attend LIU Post instead.
“This lawsuit is without merit, and we will address the facts in court,” Jon Schneider, who was LIU’s director of public relations until August and now works as an outside spokesman for LIU, said in an email. Schneider responded to inquiries on behalf of Weis, Cline and university counsel, Michael Best. Best, Weis and Cline did not directly respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the lawsuit.
“While we will not litigate the case in the media, we can say that LIU is very proud that our business school is ranked by the Princeton Review as one of the region’s top business schools and is one of just five percent of schools in the nation accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. With world-class faculty and experiential learning opportunities, we have very high demand from top students throughout our region and the country,” Schneider said.
Schneider added that the university does not expect that this litigation will have any impact on LIU students or faculty.
Mercy College compiles information about prospective students, including SAT scores and high school GPA on a spreadsheet which is used to extend offers of admission to students. Mercy claims in the lawsuit that Weis emailed this spreadsheet to his private email address and contacted those students about attending LIU.
In the complaint, Mercy College alleges that this summer, Chuck Garcia, formerly a professor in Mercy’s Business Honors program, and presently at LIU, “directly solicited two of the registered students on the High SAT list by texting them on their personal cell phones and offering them more scholarship money to attend LIU…” Mercy claims that Garcia would not have access to confidential information without disclosure by Weis. Garcia did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries.
As of May 1, 42 students were registered and accepted into Mercy’s Business Honors program. In the suit, Mercy said by July 20, nine students notified the university of their switch to Long Island University.
According to Mercy, a single student not enrolled in the University costs around $32,252. This sum includes tuition, registration, board and meal plans per year. Mercy claims that the loss of these students has extra weight as they were not just part of the Honors College, but also had stellar SAT scores and academic records.

Dr. Shawn Welnak, assistant professor of philosophy, has recently returned from a year- long sabbatical. During the 2017-2018 academic year, he explored modernity through the eyes of the ancient Greeks in New Orleans, Louisiana. He wanted to translate Homer’s poetry, and aims to write a book on Homer and the creation of the Western mind.

This semester, Welnak continues to ponder similar matters. Many events worldwide concern- ing social figures such as President Donald Trump or Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban create diversity in what people today consider to be modernity. In order to find new ways to understand the world, he turned to Homer and the ancient Greeks.
“My thought was that by turning to the beginning, which also may be accidentally the pinnacle and high point of civilization, I could reexamine that beginning in the hope of finding some way forward, a new way of conceiving politics,” Welnak explained. He finds the ultimate division to be between human excellence and equality, and he believes the Greeks found a balance between the two. “[I want] to find a new way forward by reconceiving the past, or looking at aspects that were not visible to scholars until now,” he added.
“I’ve come to see [the West] as a civilization that, more than any other, has accomplished what Homer calls ‘great deeds,’” Welnak said. He believes in the importance of having a sense of wonder. “Wonder arises in the human soul from perplexity; it is the opposite of the mind of an ideologue who thinks he possesses knowledge.”
Welnak believes his sabbatical has made him wiser. “The last two years made visible things that were invisible to me,” he said. “I’ve been able to take seriously and think through things I couldn’t previously think through with sufficient seriousness.”
Philosophy and politics, according to Welnak, are incompatible. “Custom rules political life,” he explained. “The ground of political life is unexamined common opinion, and the ground of philosophy is the examined life.” 
Welnak is also teaching Business Ethics, and Happiness and the Good Life this semester, as well as his recurring course Philosophy and Film.

The third annual Great Lawn Festival took place inside Hillwood Commons on Wednesday, Sept. 12, and was organized and run by the Student Activities Board.
The event, which was originally scheduled to be held outdoors but was moved inside due to rain, included a live band, funnel cake station, cotton candy, and various activity stations that allowed students to take home a street sign or colorful wax hand mold.
Austin Burroughs, a sophomore psychology major, said his favorite part of the festival was the band. “I would like to see more music-related events on campus,” he said.
Sarah Wong, a sophomore journalism major, enjoyed seeing Student Government Association (SGA) representatives encouraging people to become members. “I would like to see more of the clubs out on the floor during major events interacting with people,” she said. She felt the event could have been longer, as some students couldn’t attend because it was only during common hour.
The best part of the Great Lawn festival for Tom Stafford, a junior criminal science major, was having the popcorn and cotton candy stations, which he described as “genius” additions to the festival. However, he wished there were rain dates for the outdoor events. “I would like to see future events with arcade-themed activities, such as skee-ball and video games,” he added.

A new school year means fresh faces. Freshmen transitioning from highschool to college are adjusting to new responsibilities and changes, but the class of 2022 are here and ready to make their mark on Post.
Imoniri Aghomon is beginning the year undecided, but she is positive about starting her first semester.
It’s her first time away from her hometown, Bay Shore, yet she is optimistic about the opportunities ahead. “It’s refreshing, [there is] so much to do on campus, lots of stuff to get me involved. The teachers give so much support, they want you succeed rather than fail and want you to communicate – the faculty [are] beyond what I could’ve expected,” she said.
Though undecided, Aghomon is considering a major in nursing, influenced by stories from when her mother was in nursing. She also heard rumors of incompetence with some health professionals, so through nursing she hopes to “make a change and give the health profession a new face.”
As an athlete coming from Bay Shore High School, Aghomon has acquired and brought with her extensive athletic awards. With the titles of All Country Shot Put, Weight Throw & Discus thrower in both 2018 seasons, All Long Island Weight Thrower, as well as All State No.1 and No.5 in Discus and Weight Throw respectively, Aghomon is eagerly waiting to start her freshman year of track and field.
Despite her accolades, she holds education as a high priority, and she intends to keep a healthy balance between school, sports and friends while representing The Pioneers in the best way possible.
Aghomon’s adjustment to the social side of college is going smoothly.
“Just from the few days of classes I noticed that the students are really relaxed, we all got to really know about each others strengths and weakness. We are all willing to help each other,” she said.
Aghomon lives on campus and gets along well with her roommate Margrett, who she met early in June.
“Things have to be done before and after moving,” she said. Planning who is getting what and when is important for the move-in process to be quick and easy. She and her roommate had to completely rearrange their dorm room to make the most out of the space they had.
With new experiences ahead and a reignited passion to achieve more, Aghomon is aiming to break barriers both academically and competitively. From the nursing field to the track field, be sure to look out for the Bay Shore High School graduate, now LIU Post freshman, Imoniri Aghomon.

Summer is over and students have returned to campus to begin a new semester. Their return is a time to reflect on both their past accomplishments and future goals for achievement and success.
Julia McCloe, a sophomore musical theater major, has substantial goals in mind. “One of my goals is to get more involved in the Pioneer community. I want to explore all
of the various opportunities available to me at Post,” McCloe said. “I also want to find a way to make student voices heard more clearly when it comes to what goes on at LIU. I sometimes feel as though student opinions aren’t considered when big decisions are made at the University, and I’d like to open up an easier way to communicate with faculty. I’m striving to get higher grades than I did last semester as well.”
 

Lennon Ashton, a sophomore music education major, has high hopes. “I’m really look- ing forward to coming back to Post. LIU Post is a great school with great vibes, amazing students, wonderful faculty, and it’s a place where you really get the most out of your education. For me personally, I’m looking forward to teach music in the future and this place is getting me so much closer to my dream job, and I think this is going to be a successful school year for all of us,” Ashton declared.
 
 
Michaela Fox, a junior musical theater major, intends to explore more of her passions. “I’m really excited for this year ahead. I know junior year is really challenging and it pushes people and I’m ready for the challenge; my main goal is to entirely delve myself into my work, [and] to have more fun than I had in the past. My first two years were this adjustment period and getting used to school, and this year I’m into this groove, I’m into this pattern, and I’m ready to stick with it and keep going and have my method and have my pattern and make it work for me.”
 
 
Juliana Caputo, a junior adolescent education major with a concentration in English, is also hopeful for this semester. “I realize it went so fast and it kind of just hit me when I became a junior, so I’m really looking forward to getting more involved on campus. There’s a couple of clubs I’m hoping to join, and I’m really enjoying my classes this semester. So it’s exciting being back,” Caputo mentioned.
 
 
 
 
 
Matt Goldstein, a senior criminal justice major, says he also wants to be more involved on campus this year. “Right now I’m Vice President of Be the Change, so that means I’ll have a bigger role promoting the club, making sure more people go to events, and making this club bigger and better. And also [I want to] make sure [that I ] go to a lots of sports games, that athletes can come in [to the club] and more fraternities and sororities, and more collaborations with them for events.”
 
 

 
Amanda Jean-Louis, a senior music major, expressed her hopes to meet the challenges that senior year will pose. “Classes are a lot more demanding than usual, as is to be expected, but I will be attacking it with every fiber of my being and I am also going to be really balancing that with a social life and doing exactly what I did before.”

The Department of Theater, Dance & Arts Management is far more than just the individuals acting on stage. There’s a whole other world behind the curtains, filled with late nights and fueled by coffee. Senior theatre production major with a focus in stage management, Katherine Keaney has certainly established herself as one of the faces behind the many PTC shows.
Keaney has been through ups and downs as a member of PTC. Starting at LIU Post as a musical theatre major, Keaney knew that her love for the theatre was for more than just the act of performing, which resulted in her changing her major fall 2016. “I realized I never loved performing; it’s [just] all I knew. At the end of the day I’ve always loved theater as a whole. And the process of taking words on the page and making them mean something,” Keaney said.
She had not heard of LIU Post before 2014; all Keaney knew was that she wanted to be close to the Big Apple. “Post seemed like a very welcoming campus, bright, with a very strong theatre program, with a close approximation to New York City,”  Keaney said. “But also good vibes!”
Like other prospective students, the Boston native attended auditions in the fall of 2014 with Unified in NYC. “My mother was a college counselor, so she insisted I look at the school despite me not wanting to because I hadn’t heard of it before,” she said. “We were in the neighborhood because I was looking at Hofstra, which is a renowned program, and I fell in love the campus immediately.” Keaney’s connection with the other prospective students and professors like Dave Hugo made her decision an easy one. “He (Hugo) influences students, he sets a really strong influence and passion for their students and about LIU Post that is undeniable,” Keaney said.
Spending her last summer working for online last minute ticket app TodayTix, Keaney was absorbed in the Broadway lights and met many of her stage idols. “I did run into a lot of the LIU Post theatre faculty, and like the entire athletic department,” she said.
Senior year has much to offer for Keaney. “It’s really now about honing my craft and getting confident and comfortable in the decisions you made. It’s really the year of taking all you’ve learned and just letting yourself settle and grow, and prepare for the next step,” Keaney said. After graduation, Keaney hopes to travel. “In the long run I want to be a part of art, that includes culture and cultivates what it means to be human, what it means to learn about other places,” Keaney said. “I want to tour, I want to be a part of touring companies rather than settling in New York City.” This semester, Keaney will be stage managing the main stage production of Ellen McLaughin’s “Iphigenia and Other Daughters.”
Sophomore Emily Shoup has worked with Keaney since fall 2017. “She has the most amazing imagination and somehow makes the most boring tasks seem so much fun,” Shoup said.
Keaney speaks highly of her past three years. “The professors really put their all into the students so you develop some really close individual relationships,” Keaney said. “The professors in the tech classes are always talking about past students, and then they’ll meet up with each other, even students that have graduated a decade ago.”
In terms of advice for new students joining PTC, Keaney wishes she had more confidence from the beginning. “Don’t let anyone else define you, just make your own choices and do them for you and you’ll find your way. Don’t stop working and don’t lose sight of the passion, because at the end of the day you’re going to be okay.”
Editor’s note: This series follows the returning members of the Post Theatre Company.

The S.A.L. Gallery unveiled their first exhibition of the year entitled, “Wake Up.” The formal reception was held on Wednesday, Sept. 12, and consisted of artwork by five masters in fine arts (MFA) students. Each student chose a current issue that people need to be aware of as their source of inspiration.
Jessica Hart, a first year MFA student, focused on animal abuse and the killing of endangered animals with her artwork. Inspired by her love for animals Hart used soft pastels and charcoal to draw her two displayed pieces. Hart, who is also an art teacher, hopes that by looking at her drawings people will realize the brutality of animal abuse.
Kathleen Celestin-Parks, a second year MFA student, focused on women’s rights and issues with her artwork. She was inspired by various news stories about topics such as the “Me Too” movement. Celestin-Parks, who is also an art teacher, hopes that by looking at her printmaking artwork, people will realize that someday they might wake up and find that their rights are gone.
Danielle Savarese, a second year MFA student and elementary school teacher, focused on pollution of the earth and oceans as the concept behind her pieces. Inspired by her passion for the ocean and the time she met sea turtles while snorkeling, Savarese hopes that by looking at her paintings people will become more aware of the pollution and the dangers animals face in the polluting world.
Second year MFA student Sharon Papp focused on the enviromment and humans’ wasteful ways with her artwork. Inspired by the plastic vortexes in each of the Earth’s oceans, Papp used mixed media, mostly utilizing plastic bags she found on
the beach. Papp, a special education art teacher in Queens, hopes that by looking at her artwork people will feel a sense of urgency to do something about the planet’s garbage crisis.
Additionally, Farina Bayat’s work was also on display. Her use of calligraphy and India ink gave her drawings a delicate touch.
Those who attended the reception were completely absorbed in the artwork. The room was quiet, but everyone’s thoughts were loud enough to spark a feeling of change within their hearts.

This past week the Post Music Department welcomed a brand new ensemble to its’ extensive repertoire, an all Women’s Choir. Led by Dr. Jennifer Scott Miceli this is the first Women’s Choir that Post has been known to have. But what exactly is a Women’s Choir? “It is the coming together of women singers of all ages to nurture and support one another through music,” describes Miceli, “[The] Women’s Choir will grow the musicianship of each of its’ members and provide an opportunity for expression through song.”
Last spring Dr. Mark Shapiro, the director of Choral Activities, approached Miceli about the creation of the new ensemble due to the recent recruitment of women singers. It seemed like an obvious way to showcase these women’s talents and allow other students, regardless of major, to partake in the team building and creative experience.
Miceli serves as the conductor for the ensemble, and is assisted by graduate student and choir member Courtney Sack, additionally Christine Doré serves as the accompanist. However, teaching the music is a joint effort that all three take part in.
Sixteen women attended the first rehearsal, and the group is now up to 21 members. The group currently hosts two alumni, six non- music majors, 10 undergraduate music majors, and three graduate music majors. The choir is organized into soprano I, soprano II, alto I, and alto II in order to be capable of singing challenging, multi-part repertoire.
“[The] Women’s Choir will be performing a variety of music including contemporary, classical, a capella, jazz, pop, and more” mentions Miceli. This fall the group will be performing Randall Thompson’s Alleluia, Charles Baker’s arrangement of Three Hanukkah Songs, Karen Beth’s arrangement of Touching, Ain’t No Grave Can Hold My Body Down by Caldwell and Ivory, and Aretha Franklin’s Chain of Fools as tribute to the late, great singer.
“I love the fresh sound this ensemble has. It is a group of 21 women who have never concertized together, and we are just loving every second of making music and finding our sound!” exclaims Sack, “I would love for this group to become a staple at LIU. I am graduating in May, so it would nice to come back and see the progress and amazing music this group will be making in the future! I am also excited to get to conduct these wonderful women in performance this semester!”
According to Miceli the group has already demonstrated tremendous potential and she has a particular interest in providing the members leadership roles within the choir. “Music students, and in particular music education students, are encouraged to direct choral warm-up exercises in each rehearsal,” she said.
Miceli finds the conducting process to be “fun, rigorous, expressive, terrifying, and so very gratifying.”
With performances already on the horizon, the Women’s Choir is ready to display its’ talents and high performance calibre. They will be performing with the Long Island Sound Vocal Jazz in the new Krasnoff Theatre (previously Hillwood Concert Hall) on Saturday, November 17th at 8 p.m. In addition, the group will collaborate with the Huntington Choral Society at Huntington High School on Saturday, December 8th at 8 p.m.
Miceli and Sack are elated by the potential and positive response the group has had. “I am so happy with all the buzz this choir is receiving. I am so glad so many women saw our flyers and wanted to join us in song!” Sack commented. “I was extremely impressed by all of the women who came out. We had several non-music majors, and they are very musical, and just love to sing!”
Students interested in joining the Women’s Choir have until the end of the Add/Drop period (Sept. 18) to join. Rehearsals are every Wednesday from 5-7:30 p.m. in the Music Rehearsal Building. If unable to join this semester individuals are more than welcome to contact Miceli and Sack about joining in the spring semester. Contact them at Jennifer.Miceli@liu. edu and Courtney.Sack@my.liu.edu.

If you know somebody with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) or would like to spread the word about a good cause, on Sept. 21, the Tilles Center will host the Creative Aging Mini-Symposium for people of with mobility disabilities.
The Tilles Center does more than house live performances, is accessible and friendly to various audiences, which Stephanie Turner, director of education and outreach at the Tilles Center, said.
“One of our initiatives here is to provide for what we call the ‘underserved audience,’” Turner said. “What we are recognizing is that there are more adult citizens that have limited mobility as well as health related issues such as Parkinson’s.” PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects brain cells that produce dopamine. Side effects include muscle spasms, speech impediments and fatigue.
The Tilles Center has partnered up with the Mark Morris Dance for PD program for the first time to provide a fun way of treatment for the attendees, according to Turner.
“Research has shown that people with Parkinson’s that a very effective treatment is to stay active and make sure that you have that mind body connection,” she said. Admission is free due to a sponsorship from Dance Party For Parkinson’s, a non-profit organization that helps raise money for Parkinson’s research.
The Creative Aging Mini-Symposium will consist of a dance class, luncheon, a screening of the documentary, “Capturing Grace” and a Q&A featuring the Dance for PD program director, David Leventhal, who will also be teaching the dance class.
For more information on the charities, visit dancepartyforparkinsons.org, markmorrisdancegroup.org and danceforparkinsons.org.

Not many of us are accustomed to read- ing food labels before we indulge in a bag of Sour Patch Kids or a cup of yogurt, and many people are uninterested in the ingredients in a McDonald’s strawberry milkshake. However, these snacks, among many other popular items in stores and at restaurants, contain a common additive that is so controversial that it’s banned in other countries such as the U.K.; food dyes.
Odds are that if you read the ingredient list of any food item that has any coloring, you’ll find the names Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2, and other simple colors. They’re seemingly simple but in actuality these colors are cooked up in a laboratory, made up of many hard-to- pronounce chemicals. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has deemed these chemicals “safe to consume in small amounts.”
But just how small is small? This guideline is hard to grasp and even harder to measure since the actual amount of dye in each food product is unknown, as is the amount of dye ingested by an individual each day. Since dyes are often found in more than one consumed product, it can be almost impossible to tell.
Studies performed by the British government that have been published on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website confirm that some studies performed by the FDA regarding food dyes have been found to be inaccurate, since they’re often done on lab rats and are terminated before the animals have the physiological ability to develop disease or illness. The typical length of a funded study is two rat years which equates to about sixty five human years. Many criticize this because unless rats are administered the proportionally appropriate amount of dyes that the average person would consume in sixty five years, it cannot be deemed accurate.
Food dyes have gained a negative popular opinion based on several small scaled human studies. Dr. Warner Beteman, a member of the British government, and allergists from San Francisco, California have performed studies concluding that the artificial dyes Red 40 and Yellow 5 cause hyperactivity and exhibit geno- toxic effects on chromosomes.
Genotoxicity is when chemicals exert a mutational effect on the chromosomes of certain genetically predisposed individuals. The mutational effects observed in studies include the development of cancerous and non cancerous tumors, as well as altered nervous system development and function.
Developing children are the demographic with the greatest exposure to artificial dyes. Since early childhood is the stage of life when
the most important growth and development is occurring, it would seem that this would be the most apparent time to steer clear of food dyes. It’s been concluded in a 2004 European study that cocktails of dyes in products actually have the ability to create synergistic effects, meaning that when blended, negative physiological processes are actually accelerated. Also concluded is the fact that children with ADHD benefited in 73 percent of cases from eliminating artificial colorings, experiencing improved symptoms and decreased need for medication.
While other countries are either required to label products that contain dyes or have eliminated them completely, the U.S. still backs up the claim that dyes aren’t an issue since they’re only “present in negligible amounts.”

According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, major companies and manufacturers such as McDonalds, Mars, Pepsi and Kraft in other countries have switched to natural dyes and food colorings from vegetables.
In the U.K., orange soda is actually colored with carrot and pumpkin extracts rather than a cocktail of yellow and red chemicals.
While more research and concrete studies are necessary in the field of food colorings, it can’t hurt to read food labels and try and control the amount of colorings consumed. You may be surprised to find that the pickles, ice cream, salmon and the salad dressing in your shopping cart are full of a rainbow of controversial colors.

Everything happens for a reason. The good and the bad all come together to lead us to where we are meant to be, but sometimes we get stuck in the bad moments and don’t understand why good things can’t always come our way.
I am guilty of getting too caught up with why certain things don’t go as planned. I get upset and want to give up on my goals, but I am working on being patient and making lessons out of my mistakes.
We are all on a separate journey to achieve the best life possible for ourselves, but obstacles get in our way and cause us to lose the motivation and happiness we need to get there.
It can happen to anyone; your grades could be failing and it can cause you to question if this is worth it, or one bad game in whatever sport you play makes you feel like giving up. As scary as it seems, in order to get to where we want to be, we have to face these challenges instead of dwelling on them. In the end, the hardships we overcome make us stronger and make reaching our goals that much more glorious.
A new way to approach those obstacles is to embrace them and learn from them. Not everything is going to be easy to achieve, but when we take the time to teach ourselves how to approach our goals differently after a loss it helps to improve ourselves. No matter the set back, you need to keep your mind positive through your journey.
When one door closes, another door opens. It is okay to take a few steps back when hit with an obstacle, but it is never okay to give up without giving it your all.

It was a scorcher at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 15 as the Pioneers played against the Adelphi University Panthers for the first time this season.
It was a slow game in both the first and second halves, with the score static at 0-0. It wasn’t until the end of the 67th minute when a sharp pass by senior forward, Emily Miller connected to sophomore midfielder Sammy Bell, to put the Pioneers on top 1-0 with less than three minutes left in regulation.
Prior to the combined effort by Bell and Miller, Miller had drawn a penalty for body contact earlier in the half.
“The penalty affected me slightly; I was more heated than anything because it wasn’t a call I agreed with, but I knew that when I got back in the game we had to step it up with the few minutes that were left,” Miller said.
While it seemed like the Pioneers had sealed the deal by the late goal, the Panthers were given a break by scoring on a penalty shot with over one minute left in regulation.
As the clock dwindled down, there was a brief intermission before overtime, which gave the Pioneers a minute to put together a strategy.
“Before overtime, we all got together and talked about the heart and passion we have. We usually play well in overtime, so we wanted to make sure everyone was composed and confident going into it,” Miller commented.
Overtime ended as quickly as it began as Miller scored the game-winning goal just 58 seconds into the period, assisted by freshman forward, Emma Braeckmans to give the Pioneers the win.
The Pioneer’s next game is Sunday, Sept. 23 at 11 a.m. at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium against Saint Anselm College

Last year, they made history as the university’s first ever women’s rugby team. This year, with six new recruits, strong bonds and leadership will take them through their second season as a NCAA team.
Venture to the practice fields behind the Pratt Recreation Center and hear the whistles and the laughter – it’s the women’s rugby team in the middle of their practice. This semester, the team welcomes 14 players that are new to the sport, something head coach John Royal sees as the team’s biggest challenge. He pointed out two elements that they are working on to improve themselves.
“We are still a work in progress when it comes to fundamental skills and game management,” Royal said. Bella Lubsey, a freshman film major, agrees. “Because we have some players that are fully brand new to the game, we just need to strengthen the general background knowledge of how to play,” she said.
In all team sports, strong connections between players are important, especially in a sport like rugby. Their bonds are one of the team’s biggest strengths.
Frankie Ferrara, a senior health science major, pointed out the team’s strong ability to be there for each other. “It’s a rough sport so you have to be close with your team. We work really well together and we can really rely on each other. Even if it’s outside of rugby, if something happens we are always there to pick each other up,” she said.
Each team member has their own unique background. “How we just all come together is wonderful. Each one of us has something different that we bring to the team, and I feel like that is unique,” Nickala Stephens, a freshman pre-medical science major, said.
Walking in to their second season, Royal has a clear goal. “My goal for this group is to play smart, intelligent rugby [and] to show excellence in the classroom while setting an example of sportsmanship and leadership both on and off the field.”
The rugby team’s season began with a 34-26 victory against Castleton in their season opener Sept. 2, followed by a 36-0 loss against Molloy College Sept. 8, putting them at 1-1 for the season. Their next game is Sunday, Sept. 23, at 12 p.m. where the Pioneers welcome Colby-Sawyer College to their home field.
