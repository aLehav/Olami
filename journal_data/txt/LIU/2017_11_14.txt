Despite the chaos in the world and reports of prejudice in the news, many minorities in the United States – blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and others – are excelling academically in college and thriving in life generally. Too often, we forget the contributions they make in our communities, socially and culturally. It is disappointing to see the rage that they experience when still being labeled as the minorities in our multicultural society. Students often feel stigmatized when labels are placed on them, often because of their socio-economic status. Many overcome the labels, however, soar through this issue and lead by example. Blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities in our communities should not feel like outcasts, because all lives matter.
Pablo Correa, the 2016 salutatorian of Hempstead High School, is a sophomore at Dartmouth College. Although he is undecided about his major, he is leaning towards anthropology, with global health and chemistry minors. He is also on the pre-med track. Before entering college, he was actively involved in his high school, serving as Vice President of the Hempstead High School class, Vice President of Club Truth, President and Refounder of Future Doctors of America, and more. Correa, who was born in Colombia, came to the United States when he was four years old. As high school came to an end, he became determined to face the next chapter of his academic career with determination and excellence. Yet, he felt like an outcast during the college application process. “I can’t say for sure that I have experienced racial profiling, but I have felt like an outsider in many different situations, most of them here at Dartmouth or when I was visiting other schools like Princeton or Cornell,” he said.
Correa has encountered moments when he felt uncomfortable sitting in class in college because he was the only racial/ethnic minority in the room. Yet, he has not allowed this to deter him from academic success. Correa continues to go to events on campus and he makes it apparent that he is a low-income, first generation college student. Correa became actively involved in Dartmouth’s First Year Student Enrichment Program. This program enables first-generation students to become used to the college environment. With the help of the director of the program, he became acquainted with the resources Dartmouth has to offer, which helped him in his transition into the new environment. Correa’s mother reminds him to ignore the connotations placed on him because of his race. He continues to give back to Hempstead High School students by returning to discuss Dartmouth and the college application process.
“While in college, it’s very important to focus on yourself and not where everyone else is at,” Correa said. “I know that’s a very difficult thing to do, but it is also important. The only person you should compare yourself to is your older self.”
Karen Lopez, the 2014 Valedictorian from Hempstead High School, is a senior at Columbia University, majoring in economics. She was born in El Salvador and came to the United States when she was eight years old. She is now happily living in the city. The transition from Salvador to the United States was difficult for her because English wasn’t her first language. As time passed, Lopez practiced English with the help of her third grade teacher. Fast forward to senior year, Lopez realized how challenging the college application was for her. She focused on Ivy League schools because of the need-based financial assistance. The competitiveness of applying to these schools drove her hunger to become intellectually challenged.
“Focusing on Ivy Leagues and coming from a school like Hempstead High School was hard in itself because I found people doubting me. I didn’t have too many people to look up to. I couldn’t speak to my parents about the stress of the process and I couldn’t look at anyone else in my family because I was the first one to consider going to college. This truly tested my perseverance as I questioned myself many times if I was good enough to go to a top college,” she said.
Lopez felt intimidated at first when she visited colleges and it was difficult for her to find her voice in a new environment. She saw that there weren’t many students with her racial background at the top Ivy League schools. This has driven her to work even harder in her school work to show that she can make it in life, regardless of where she comes from. Although it took her a year to embrace her culture at Columbia University, this was the time she needed. She decided to join Latinxs, a student organization on campus. This transformed her whole college experience.
“I realized that while I did like being exposed to different people, I also needed the space to spend time with people who looked like me and who were facing similar struggles. Through this organization, I met some of my closest friends and started to learn a lot from them about Latinidad and what it meant to be trailblazers in our communities,” she said.
Dondre Lemon, a junior journalism major at LIU Post who is black, was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts and moved to the Bronx when he was six months old. The transition from the city to Long Island was difficult for him when he arrived at Post.
“When I first arrived on campus, I did feel different from the other students because the majority of the students were from Long Island and I was a city kid that didn’t know certain topics students would talk about,” he said. Although this took a toll on him when he started at Post, his passion for unity of cultures drove him to become more interested in reporting and journalism. Lemon has demonstrated to professors and others that it depends on the individual, not the color of their skin. People would not have guessed that Lemon was a reporter in the Bronx while he was in high school. He demonstrated excellence by receiving an award for his reporting skills and by publishing two articles with the nor news. Lemon is a staff writer now for the LIU Post school newspaper and the creator of the new PTV- Pioneer news show. He is thankful for the support system that has helped him with his transition to the college environment.
“Almost every professor helped me in some way. A lot of them definitely made the transition easier for me and warmed me up to the campus. I definitely know my success coach helped a lot, making me feel comfortable, if I had any problems; I know I can go to her for anything. Having friends has also helped me, and what makes it better for me is that I am meeting new people of different cultures, which I feel everyone should have in their circle of friends,” he said.
Next year, Lemon will take an editorial position on the student newspaper. He continues to be an inspiration for students coming from low socio-economic backgrounds who may lack confidence in their abilities.
Lemon believes that the negative stereotyping and labeling needs to change. “The first thing I do is tell my friends of color not to classify any group. Don’t say all whites this, or Muslims that. Right now, we need to be together and be united, no matter the color of your skin,” he said.
As a reporter, Lemon wants to show others that they do not have to have a high socio-economic background or grow up in a wealthy community to make it in any career they desire. “If I can inspire one person that they can make it just the way they are, I will definitely feel like I have made a difference in the world,” he said.
Amoy Brown, 2016 graduate of Hempstead High School, is now a sophomore at the University of Albany, with
an English major and journalism minor. She was born in Jamaica and moved to America when she was five years old. Brown has also felt like an outcast in a college that’s predominately white. Growing up in Hempstead, people had expectations of how she is supposed to behave. However, she proves them wrong.
“My skin color is something that I have definitely became more conscious of,” she said. Also with the world today, it’s kind of hard to do anything without thinking about the barriers that race does cause.”
In Brown’s college environment, she has noticed instances in which she was the only black person in her class, but she didn’t let this hold her back. “Just because I’m more conscious of it now doesn’t mean it makes me any less confident in who I am or what I do,” she said
With this confidence, Brown has taken advantage of what the university offers. She noticed how UAlbany celebrates cultures. She found various organizations that help empower people of color like herself. She joined an organization called the Black Theater Production, which promotes the performing arts for people of color. In addition, Brown was awarded a journalism internship with the student affairs media team. She also joined an organization called “Her Campus,” an online magazine where she can express herself.
Tibian Ahmed, a senior at Stony Brook University, was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Ahmed, who is Muslim,
has encountered many instances when she has been racially profiled and has felt like an outcast, especially during her years of schooling.
“As early as elementary school all the way through my now final semester at college. It’s happened at work, my internships, even in personal settings meeting some of my non Muslim friends’ parents,” she said.
At times, in social settings at school, Ahmed has felt tested because of the comments made about her. She noticed how students would take pictures of her and make fun of her while she was sitting in the dining hall. People would also taunt with her hijab. Ahmed was the only girl who wore the hijab at her first school, SUNY Brockport. “People would purposely work in groups of three so that they wouldn’t work with me,” she said.
Ahmed has had uncomfortable situations with professors as well. During her freshman year at SUNY Brockport, students were assigned a 10 page research paper and the professor gave the topics to the students. The professors gave her, ‘Should the U.S Iraq war have started?” She was the only student assigned this topic. She had no choice but to comply with the professor’s request. In order to make this assignment unbiased, Ahmed made sure she asked other students if they thought the war should have started. Towards the end of her presentation, the professor stated her own biased opinion.
Ahmed has encountered other moments when professors would make thoughtless statements about Islamic terrorism or extremism and try to convince her that her hijab is an inconvenience. Also, professors at both colleges she attended have asked her how the process was for her family coming to the United States as refugees. Ahmed felt as if they were committed to setting a low standard for her by assuming she wasn’t American. Ahmed had to overcome these situations on her own because her parents didn’t have the same experiences. Because her siblings are significantly younger, they too didn’t understand what she has gone through. Ahmed also realized the significance of the date September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11. This was the day she placed her hijab on for the very first time, when she was six years old.
Although she has faced criticism, Ahmed used this to elevate herself in school instead. She began interning at CNN. She interned with white men who were middle aged and she noticed how they had a different tone with her as she stepped in to contribute.
“I get it, because they didn’t experience people like me. This is a pattern; this is how they have been taught to think, and it’s a bigger issue. It’s unfortunate, you are at a point where you can think for yourself but they chose not to, people chose not to challenge themselves because it’s more convenient for them,” she said.
Before transferring to Stony Brook, Ahmed became a speaker for the diversity conference at her first school, SUNY Brockport. She spoke out to faculty members and students about her life growing up post 9/11 and her experiences. Ahmed also founded the MSA (Muslim Student Association), which tries to bring a Muslim friendly environment to students, holding events about Islam awareness and reaching out to non-Muslim students on campus about their experiences growing up on post 9/11.
“It’s either I was going to do something to make myself feel like I belong there or just let it get to me,” Ahmed said.
At Stony Brook, Ahmed has become an executive producer for Newsbreak En Espanol and also an EOP success coach to mentor students on time management, critical thinking and writing skills.
“Don’t keep yourself in a bubble – what scares you the most is the most important thing to challenge yourself with,” she said. “You need to be respectful and make sure you are not a part of the problem.”
These students, like so many of their peers, have overcome prejudice and stereotyping by working hard and demonstrating excellence. The issue has not gone away and needs to be further addressed in our communities today.
Until then, let’s continue to work hard and demonstrate that we are all the same. It’s time to stand up and remember we are all dreamers. Let’s make the labeling stop and make America great again in this way.

Members of the Black Student Union (BSU) were in a frenzy when an anonymous note was left on a locker belonging to Catrina Dasque and Laura Raneau. Both Dasque and Raneau are eboard members of the BSU chapter on campus, as public outreach personnel and social chair, respectively.
Dasque, a sophomore biology major, and Raneau, a sophomore undecided, are both commuter students and share a locker on the second floor of Hillwood commons. They posted a  BSU flyer on their locker within the first two weeks of school and have had it up ever since. On Tuesday, Oct. 31, while both students were in class, a note was left by an anonymous person stating the following, “If you’re trying to promote diversity then you shouldn’t title your group ‘black’ and you should use a picture of multiple races. Otherwise you are only emphasizing a divide and separation based on color” with a smiley face at the bottom of the note.
Iyana Loney, a sophomore fine arts major and member of BSU, happened to see the note on the locker during her lunch break. “I just felt like it was ignorant and that whoever wrote it didn’t fully read the flyer, and if they did read it they clearly didn’t understand the concept of it. I also feel that anyone who feels comfortable enough to write a note should feel comfortable enough to show up to a meeting to see what it’s about instead of just judging us from the outside,” Loney said.
Loney immediately made the president of the club, Motunrayo Olusa aware of the note without spreading it on social media and other outlets that could have made the situation even more confusing and complicated. “I commend her for her bravery and smart instincts to not take matters into her own hands and possibly make things sour for us,” Olusa, a senior business administration major, said.
The response from the members of the club was not one of aggravation or hatred but more of a simple welcoming. “BSU has never been a place of hate or division, we make sure that in all of our meetings, programs, events and anything that we put together that everyone knows that all are welcome regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation,” Olusa said.
When the letter was discussed at the following general meeting on Wednesday, many shared the feeling of confusion. “It makes me feel like black people can’t have something for ourselves without some type of judgement or controversy,” Loney said. During the meeting the members discussed ways they could handle situations like this and even how to handle a conversation with someone who has an opposing view when it comes to issues like race, gender and other controversial topics.
“I have been a member of this club for about 3 years now and not once have we mentioned hate for others or even a simple hint of separation. We discuss issues that affect us because we aren’t allowed to speak of these issues within the general population and student body on campus without either being shunned or silenced,” Ishola Duro, a senior business administration major, said.
Dasque and Raneau felt that the person who left the note on their locker should come to a BSU meeting. “Come to BSU and have a conversation with us about it instead of just writing a note,” Dasque said.
Olusa met with their club advisor Nilda Nelson, who also works in the public safety department, after their general meeting, and was reminded that they shouldn’t take matters into their own hands and should continue to exemplify their mission through their daily activities. “BSU was BSU before I got here, it will stay BSU till I graduate, and I hope that our legacy would continue as BSU in the future because of all that we have been able to achieve as an organization, regardless of the obstacles we have encountered along the way,” Olusa said.
The club meets every Wednesday during common hour in the tv room located in Hillwood Commons, all are welcome to join and express their feelings.

The foreign language department published its first newsletter last week. The newsletter featured the experiences of four students as foreign language learners.
The initiative to publish a newsletter was the idea of Jorge Rosario, chair of the foreign language department, with the help of faculty. This is Rosario’s first year as the chair and his primary concern is to promote the foreign language classes and majors offered.
The four students featured in the first newsletter are non-language majors. “It doesn’t matter if you’re not majoring in a language, there is always a chance to learn a language and it will give you an edge on the market,” Rosario said. Non-language majors were featured in the newsletter because, “It’s a way for students to notice the relevance of learning a second language for various careers, to have a better point of view of the world,” Rosario said.
Felipe Inostroza, a senior health sciences major and minor in Spanish, promoted the Spanish minor for health professionals in the newsletter. “The minor offers a strong foundation in Spanish medical terminology,” Inostroza stated. Inostroza contributed his experience to the newsletter because, “I do believe Spanish is a great minor for any career. The Hispanic community is the fastest growing minority group in the US,” Inostroza said.
Thomas Fruehsamer, Post alumnus (’16), chronicles his love affair with a Parisian woman in the newsletter. Fruehsamer begins his story with the line, “A girl who spoke French, a kiss under a gazebo, and a desire to discover together led me back to college.” After meeting a French woman, Fruehsamer enrolled in the Lifetime of Learning program, a program in which alumni can take classes for personal enrichment. Through this program he is able to take French courses in order to “better experience the rich Parisian culture.”
Also featured in the newsletter is Sasha Myrianthopoulos, a senior graphic design major. Myrianthopoulos takes Italian courses because she finds them “fun and exciting to learn.”
Although her Italian courses are not directly correlated with her major, the classes are helping her “grow as a student.” Myrianthopoulos’ advice to students interested in taking a foreign language is, “never be afraid to expand your horizons.”
Lastly, “The Wondrous Horror Story of Zack Cain,” discusses the world literature course, “The Making of a Superhero.” Zach Cain, a junior clinical laboratory science major, took the course to satisfy course requirements, but also because it allows him to, “read and write about enticing themes throughout diverse cultures, languages, and the human condition.”
A minor in Italian can be beneficial to music majors, according to Rosario. Many musical terms derive from Italian and are important for music majors to know for their careers.
In addition to Italian and Spanish, the foreign language department offers majors and minors in French, Japanese, and Russian.
The next newsletter to be published in the Spring semester will feature a student who is learning Russian even though she is of Russian background. She is using Russian language classes as a way to stay in touch with her heritage. “We also have Hispanic students who are born in the United States but want to learn more about their ethnicity.” Rosario aims to create a culturally immersive program which allows students to not only learn a language, but also explore the culture.
The newsletter is being distributed to any student taking a foreign language or World Literature class, as well as faculty in different departments. There are limited amount of copies, but Rosario plans to make more copies available to students and faculty across campus.
This semester the foreign language department will only publish one newsletter, but Rosario plans on publishing two for the Spring.

It can start with something as simple and small as a brown napkin, or replacing a plastic plate with a paper plate or not wasting food. Aramark, the main food provider for campus dining locations including Hillwood Café, Twisted Taco, Subway, End Zone, and Winnick Student Center, includes locally sourced foods in 24 percent of their dishes.
To some students, sustainability means recycling, turning the faucet off when you’re brushing your teeth and not leaving the television on during class. For more than two years, Post’s sustainability committee has worked to drive more focus and student awareness towards healthy living and eating. So why don’t more people know about it?
“There’s waste everywhere, it’s just about being efficient,” Justin Poly, food service director and former executive chef at Winnick Student Center, said. Small steps have been taken towards reducing the amount of waste we produce on campus, like recycling cardboard and fry oil. But with the adoption of the new “Green Thread” program, Aramark is hoping to reach its “20 by 20” goal and reduce the calories on the Winnick menu 20 percent by the year 2020. This year alone, they were able to reduce the number of calories by eight percent, making 30 percent of their main dishes either vegetarian or vegan.
Aramark’s goal is to reduce the environmental impact within their operations and continuously improve their own practices while offering expertise and practical solutions. The two main focuses are source reduction and food donations. Source reduction aims to minimize waste before it’s generated by accurately tracking 100 percent of the food thrown away and not eaten, while surplus food is donated to those in need; this is in partnership with the Food Donation Connection (FDC), a privately owned company that partners with restaurants and food service providers to donate the food to local hunger relief agencies in the community.
The Green Thread approach is derived directly from the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) food waste hierarchy, which aims to reduce waste directly from the source. Whenever possible, Aramark purchases seasonal and responsibly grown and sourced produce. The campus is less than 300 miles away from local produce and community-based producers.
By 2018, Aramark aims to purchase 100 percent sustainable seafood from sources that can maintain or increase production without jeopardizing the ecosystem. Aramark already switched over to cage-free shell eggs in 2015, and will transition completely to liquid eggs, a natural blend of egg white and egg yolk, by 2020.
Looking towards the future, there is still more that can be done. Aramark has several interactive programs to get students more involved. These programs include Recycle Mania, Campus Crunch and “Veg Out” events.
To get involved, students can contact Dr. Carlin with the sustainability committee at Scott.Carlin@liu.edu or Justin Poly at Poly-Justin@aramark.com

Veronika Dolar, who was an assistant professor of economics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at LIU Post for six years, is now an assistant professor in the Department of Politics, Economics and Law at SUNY Old Westbury. Dolar left the university after the spring 2017 semester, when she did not receive tenure.
At Post, Dolar taught introductory courses in microeconomics, statistics, and macroeconomics. “I developed a number of very original courses,” she said. “I did Health Economics, Economics of Obesity. I offered the Fed Challenge two years ago [2015]; this is the first and only time LIU Post students participated in this challenge.” The Pioneer covered the Fed Challenge in its Oct. 6, 2015 issue. Mijail Quintín Mariano, then a senior economics major, was encouraged by Dolar to be the captain of the Fed Challenge team and subsequently got a job as an analyst at the New York Federal Reserve.
Dolar also organized a study abroad program to Slovenia, her home country, during the summer of 2015. The courses were “The Transition Economies of Central Europe,” and, “The Former Soviet Union,” which took place in Slovenia from July 1 through 15.
She also worked with students on independent study projects. “I typically offered a number of independent research studies. A number of my students presented their research at the New York State Economics Association conference, Pennsylvania State Economics Association conference, and at LIU Post and Beyond, [the conference held by the College of Liberal Arts in the spring semester]. Typically, two or three students had a presentation at Post,” she said.
Dolar’s research includes more than 12 peer-reviewed publications in top-tier journals in the field, publications which dealt with economics, nutrition and more. Dolar presented twice at the American Economic Association conference. “Typically people who present there are from the very top prestigious institutions in the world,” she said. “It’s impossible to get your research accepted there.” Dolar stated that she won the LIU David Newton Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2016. Which made the denial of her tenure all the more surprising to her.
“I really don’t know on what basis I was denied,” Dolar said. “There’s no matrix or numbers according to which faculty who did get tenure were better than me. The only exception between me and them were that they were males,” she added. Student enrollment and student major numbers for both philosophy and history – the fields in which two professors received tenure instead of her – are dwindling, she said, while economics has a higher rate. Dolar feels that the university’s decision is an example of “serious sexual discrimination.” Lori Knapp, Vice President of Academic Affairs, would not discuss Dolar with the Pioneer. “Promotion and tenure cases are extremely confidential and individual cases are not documented in any public formats,” she said.
Dolar made contributions to the Honors College in the area of student enrollment. “I was teaching classes there that almost no one previously enrolled in [except for two or three students]. When I taught, within a few days, these courses filled out.”
Outside of her department, Dolar taught in the psychology department, where she worked with Nancy Frye, professor of psychology, and an advanced statistics course in the spring 2017 semester. Students were able to design research studies and conduct analyses based on those studies. “And yet,” she said, “the [university] claims that there is no institutional need for me.”
Michael Soupios, professor of political science and a member of the personnel committee that reviewed Dolar’s file, argued that there was no good reason she was denied tenure. “The suspicion among the faculty was that this was an economic decision, not an academic decision,” Soupios said. Knapp did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the basis of the decision, other than to state that promotion and tenure decisions are confidential.
“The administration referenced at least one economic reason for the denial of Professor Dolar’s tenure,” John Lutz, professor of English and head of the Faculty Council, said. “It was not a question of the university not being able to fulfill the long-term commitments of giving tenure to professors. They cited ‘institutional need’ as a reason. I can’t tell you exactly what that term means because the faculty are still seeking clarification from administration concerning the particulars about how this standard was applied to this and other cases.”
There is a three-step process in obtaining tenure that involves community service, teaching, and scholarship, according to Soupios and Frye, who are both tenured. Dolar said that she met all of these qualifications. “She did her due diligence and lived up to her end of the deal, and she was still denied tenure,” Soupios said.
Tenure is a long-term financial commitment on the institution’s part. “If the institution is not in a position to make those commitments, then a lot of professors will be denied tenure,” Soupios said. “Even if you have a good teaching record, you could be turned down.”
Frye, who observed one of Dolar’s classes, described her as “a very dynamic and enthusiastic instructor,” who “did a lot to help students understand the reason for the material.” Dolar made connections between the material and real-life examples, as well as the implications of it all. “She also taught an advanced statistics course for the psychology department in the spring of 2017 semester,” Frye said. Dolar’s students designed research studies and conducted analyses based on those studies, Frye said.
Though the option to apply for tenure a second time existed, Dolar, according to Michele Dornisch, professor of education, felt that a second attempt would not be worth the trouble. “I think that we, Dr. Frye and myself, believe that the loss of Veronica is a loss for the university community, in particular for the upcoming younger faculty,” Dornisch said. Professor Frye believes that Veronika Dolar was active in the whole tenure process and was very dynamic on the campus. “There’s an effort on campus to do more study abroad courses,” Frye said, “and Veronika had done one of those in Slovenia and was planning on doing it again.” There was also a plan to create a new minor in behavioral economics.
Though the academic community is getting back some of the dynamism that existed while Dolar was on the faculty, Frye said, she also noted that “there’s a certain energy level that’s gone,” and “it’s gonna take some time” for the energy to come back.
Dolar’s transition to SUNY Old Westbury has been smooth. “I feel very happy to be there,” she said. SUNY “basically created a new line for me to go there based on my teaching and research record.”

On Friday, Nov. 10, students from both LIU Post and Brooklyn campuses joined the office of Employer and Alumni Engagement for a Day In the City. The event, hosted by the office of Employer and Alumni Engagement, is the third Day In the City event since the office began the trips in the Spring 2017 semester. In the past, students were able to tour and make connections of some of the large businesses and corporations in New York City, including WNET/WLIW, Barclays Center, and Pathways Omnicom Media Corp in Spring 2017, and Microsoft on October 20. On Friday, 17 students flocked to the Twitter headquarters in downtown New York.
Students were met by host, Lejorn Leys, Twitter college recruiter and Post alumnus. Most of the architecture was expected for a New York office building, brick walls and wood floors. However, there were more abstract designs in the wallpaper that featured ambiguous elements of the city. Twitter has an easy-going environment, with no dress code, an open bar and gaming consoles in the office, and they offered in-office benefits such as showers and maternity rooms.
Leys joined three other speakers, Shelby Clayton, a client account manager, Zachary Heinemann, a research specialist, and Steward Conelius, a client partner that keeps track of the specifics of the company’s success, on a panel discussion with the students. During the discussion, there was a Q&A, and students asked questions ranging from stock prices to most importantly, the application process. The number one aspect of the application that stood out to a lot of students was that the university or college an applicant attended does not appear on the form. At Twitter, the standard is that there is more to the applicant than the name of their school. “At the end of the day, it’s just a piece of paper,” Leys said. The panel ended by encouraging students to apply for internships.
The next Day In the City has not yet been planned, yet both Moreen Mitchell, the university director of employer and alumni engagement, and Joan Yonke, the Post campus director, emphasized that there are more to come.
The office of employer and alumni engagement offers programs and events to students to better help them make connections in their fields during their education, which can benefit them later after graduation. The Future Alumni Committee, a new philanthropy initiative created by the office, will host a “Tradition Tuesday” pizza party to get current students interested in philanthropy in their office located in the old bookstore, on Tuesday, Nov. 21 during common hour. Green and gold attire required. RSVP via handshake.liu.edu.
For more information, visit the employer and alumni engagement office, their table on Tuesdays in the Hillwood Commons lobby, or Handshake.liu.edu.

Fredrick “Rick” Roberts is a junior film major who is better known this year for his Halloween costume as a split spirit.
Roberts found a tutorial on Etsy.com on how to create the spilt spirit costume. Melissa Irwin, the costume creator, stated in the video that her inspiration for the costume comes from the creatures known as “Landstriders” from the cult film “Dark Crystal.” Another inspiration is from the world renowned director Hayao Miyazaki’s work, which includes the animated films “Princess Mononoke” and “Spirited Away.” Roberts, who is fascinated with Miyazaki’s work, was hooked. “I grew up a huge fan of Miyazaki’s work as well, so you can say our inspiration stems from the same place,” Roberts said of the costume maker and himself.
The costume took Roberts hours to make and cost over $200. The supplies consisted of stilts, medical crutches, yards of foam padding, fabric, and an eerie mask. “In my opinion, the eerie mask sort of completes the ensemble,” Roberts said.
Roberts wanted to create his own costume that was extravagant enough to stand out. “I love standing out and hate blending in, so when I saw the costume online crawling across the streets, I just knew that I had to recreate to share with my friends and neighbors on Long Island,” he said.
Roberts wanted kids be awestruck, not frightened by his creation. Roberts considered Halloween to be a performance when he showcased his costume to the campus. “No matter who they were, no matter what age or background, I’ve horrified countless people in my neighborhood or on campus this Halloween. Reactions I got are either fear, bewilderment, or fascination for the costume,” he said.
Roberts won the WCWP Halloween costume contest and was awarded $75 dining dollars courtesy of Aramark. Students attending the rooftop Halloween party stopped to watch Roberts display his costume outside Hillwood Commons. “Love it or hate it, it’s a real sight to see,” he said.
Roberts would like to create another costume using elements from his latest creation that is more inspiring than frightening. Roberts is interested in creating costumes for students and making money doing it. “Anyone who wants to see my work or hire my talents can find my Instagram account where all my projects are documented (@rickrobertsprojects) or e-mail me at rickroberts95@gmail.com,” Roberts said.

Motunrayo Olusa, a senior business administration major from Middletown, New York has been a member of the Black Student Union on campus since she transferred to LIU Post from SUNY Orange in Middletown, N.Y. in her sophomore year.
Olusa joined BSU as a regular member, became treasurer in 2016 and then president 2017. In the past three years the club has held events including Black Excellence, BSU Karaoke, a 90’s social, and game night.
On Friday, Oct. 27, Olusa and her e-board members along with the runway club, ran a Halloween social event to raise money. They were able to raise over 200 dollars, items such as water, clothes and toiletries were donated to help those affected by the hurricane in Puerto Rico.
Q: As the newly elected BSU president this semster, what are some plans you have for this school year?
A: My plan for this school year is to make sure BSU continues to grow and to move in a positive direction through creating a more diverse and inviting environment for those on campus whether they identify as black or not.
Q: It’s 2017 and race is still a huge topic in today’s society; how have you been able to bring that discussion into your meetings without discriminating against others?
A: With the help of my eboard members, we have been able to carefully create discussions that are informational and engaging and relevant to the current events, such as the 2016 election, Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem, the Orlando shooting, the concept of white privilege, identity, and how we can move forward with allies and not enemies.
Q: Backlash against the club and maybe even yourself is something I would assume comes very often, am I right? And if so, how did you handle it?
A: Honestly, backlash is inevitable and in the position I’m in, I have to handle things tactfully and efficiently. I do all this to make sure that none of my members see me react in a way that could possibly affect their perspective of the people on this campus and that we continue to be examples of excellence.
Q: What makes you different from the prior presidents of BSU?
A: I have a bit of an international perspective on things due to my study abroad experience while I was in high school in Nigeria, so it aids in me seeing things than people who haven’t had the experience and that helps me being able to relate to a broader group of people than before.
Q: This year the club is bigger than ever, were you surprised at the turnout?
A: Oh yes! I was certainly surprised at the turnout because we started off as a small club with 10-15 members regularly attending to a present average to about 30-40 members regularly attending this semester. I am grateful for the growth and hopeful that it continues even after I graduate.
Q: As a senior graduating in May, what are some tools you’ve gathered from this club that you can apply into your career and life?
A: The ability to work with anybody regardless of position, race, and background because during my last year on e-board I’ve had to do these things whether I was working with other clubs or campus life. I plan on becoming a corporate lawyer and plan to use the skills that I’ve acquired during my time in college as treasurer and president of this club to navigate through my career. I have also been working on being an example of black excellence for not only my academic life but also my personal life so that those looking up to me can follow on the right path.

Dealing with death in general can be a difficult thing to handle, but the loss of a loved one can change your perspective on life. There is no guidebook on how to get through the traumatic experiences life hands us, but we can do our best to move forward. What we can do is learn from how others have handled it and take it step by step. 
After losing a loved one, you now have to live without them. No longer being able to see them, talk to them or hug them is a huge transition. Another thing you will face is trying to understand why they were taken from you. It can cause resentment and anger about the whole situation, which is common but can become unhealthy. The understanding of why it happened may never truly be answered the way you would like it to be, but becoming understanding and taking a different approach can help.
The anger of not being able to understand will prevent you from healing in a healthy matter. It is okay to feel these harsh feelings; it is only natural that we question why this has happened. If you hold onto it for too long, though, it can affect things in the future. Try looking at the positives. It can be hard to do that in such a situation, but it makes for a happier lifestyle.
If you find yourself getting upset, try remembering the special moments you’ve had if your loved one. Think about how proud they would be if they could only be with you now. Regardless of religion, it helps to feel that they with always be with you or watching over you in a sense. After my mom passed away, I started going through old family photos and watching home videos just to see her smile again. It is bittersweet, but it helps me to still feel connected to her. Other ways to feel better could be writing you feelings in a journal, seeing a therapist to talk things through or even joining a grief group. While being in college during the loss of a loved one you can always seek out a counselor at school.
Being able to apply these methods of dealing with grief to your own traumatic loss can help with your healing process and bring happiness into your life. Trust the process because healing does take time. Be patient with it and continue to bring positivity into your life when things start to get rough. Having a constructive point of view on things when you lose a loved one can have a huge impact in allowing you to move forward, as your loved one would want.

Dr. Barbara Shorter, a professor of nutrition in the School of Health Professions and Nursing, embodies a true role model in her field, in the classroom, and in leadership.
She was raised in Queens and got her bachelor’s degree in dietetics from Hunter College. She found a passion for nutrition when she started going to school originally for nursing, and found herself most interested in nutrition when speaking with dietetic students in her chemistry class.
She went back to school to NYU and Columbia University for two masters degrees. Remaining in the city for her education, she continued at Columbia University for her Doctorate in Nutrition Education (EdD).
As a registered dietitian/nutritionist (RDN), a certified dietician-/nutritionist (CDN), a member of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Urological Association, she continues to work in the field. Not only has she taught at Post since 2001, she also works one day a week in a clinical setting meeting with patients at Northwell Health on the faculty of the Smith Institute for Urology. She also spends time doing research in addition to teaching multiple nutrition classes at Post.
Dr. Shorter is an expert on interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome IC/BPS. She focuses on the effects of food sensitivity on chronic pelvic pain. Internationally known for her landmark research that is validated and published in the Journal of Urology, “Statistical Validation of the Shorter-Moldwin Food Sensitivity Questionnaire for IC/BPS Patients” her work is now used as part of the treatment algorithm for IC/BPS patients. Dr. Shorter’s work has been published for a Springer textbook on Chronic Pelvic Pain, in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the British Journal of Urology, and she has been cited over 100 times for her first article published in the Journal of Urology.
Her passion for nutrition extends overseas, as well. For the past two years during the summer she has brought students to the village of Karatu, in Tanzania, Africa, to teach the Tumaini primary and secondary school students affective nutrition and health. The two-week long volunteer trips have given Post students a chance to make an impact globally, gain experience in the health and nutrition field, and have the opportunity of a lifetime. She will continue to visit every year, because she sponsors a child from Karatu to attend school, and enjoys visiting him. Dr. Shorter calls her trips to Tanzania “a life changing experience.” On the trip, students learn from nutrition that “we don’t recognize how blessed we are, what diversity we have, how many nutritious foods we have and how many wonderful choices we can make. They don’t have a wide variety of many nutritious foods, and often there is no electric or refrigeration. It is really amazing how well people can do with so little,” she said.
In 2015, she received the Long Island Dietetic Association award for Dietician of the Year. The advice she gives to students about health and nutrition is, “Healthy eating can be very pleasurable.” You don’t have to cut out foods you don’t like to be healthy; there are many ways to enjoy tasty foods and a better quality of life.” Dr. Shorter continues to inspire her students every day with her experience and passion for this field.

Some students might find it difficult to encounter a new show with a unique, original style. Hulu’s show “Freakish” presents a high school perspective of living amidst an apocalypse.
Season one, of the monstrous show takes place in a small town at Kent High School. The school and town was built around a chemical plant where many of the citizen worked, but things took a turn for the worst when factor exploded that morning. High schoolers witnessed the explosion and retreated into the school building as the cloud of chemical residue filled the air. After a few minutes passed, they left one by one to search for their loved ones. Eventually the students who remained in the safety of the school realize that their friends and family would be transformed to mutant zombies.
Grover Jones, (Leo Howard) played by Leo Howard watched as his sister became one of the mutants, and slowly realized he was alone. One day in detention, Jones falls in love with one of his detention mates, Violet Adams (Liza Koshy). As they become close, they realize that they have a lot in common.
Diesel (Adam Hicks), is an outcast at school. LeShaen Devereaux (Melvin Gregg) is the basketball athlete of the group, well-known among the student body and loved by his girlfriend Zoe Parker (Meghan Rienks). During the frightening experience, she learns to be independent and fight for herself. Parker also learns that she doesn’t have to be pretty and popular to succeed. Finally, Barrett McIntyre (Tyler Chase) is the nerd of the group, and he seems to know why the plant exploded and remains on high alert.
Season two kicks off with the students learning more about the chemical explosion, and slowly discovering that Grover Jones might be their only way to survive.
“Freakish” is now available to watch on Hulu, with a month monthly subscription. Fees range from $5.99 to $39.99 a month to watch all episodes of season 1 and 2. Get ready to watch for hours as it is a show that will drag you in from episode one.

Thor Ragnarok is an all-around fantastic movie with great action, comedic timing, and superheroes unlike typical comic book heroes. The movie was great from beginning to end. The opening scene was as funny and incredibly put- together. 
From cameo appearances of Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the Incredible Hulk, to new characters such as Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Korg (Taika Waititi), there was the perfect amount of surprises in this movie.
Towards the end of the film, Valkyrie makes viewers love her drunken rage and heroic features. Tom Hiddleston makes his return in the Thor franchise as Loki, the trickster god and Thor’s brother. From his laughable courageousness and his self conflict of being in his brother’s shadow, Loki’s character stands out as one of my favorite roles in this movie. Hela (Cate Blanchett) is infused with bitterness and hatred for the kingdom of Asgard has returned to claim her rightful throne as Thor’s eldest sibling. It is up to Thor and what he calls his “Revengers” to put an end to her terror over Asgard and the universe.
Having seen the film twice, all other Marvel movies pale in comparison to this one. Originally, my favorite Marvel movie had been Guardians of the Galaxy but after seeing this, Thor Ragnarok has become my favorite movie in the entire franchise’s history.
It had me at the edge of my seat with laughter and excitement throughout the entire film, both times. I initially expected it to be a more serious movie like “Thor” and “Thor: The Dark World,” but director, Taika Waititi put a nice spin on preconceived expectations of a Thor film and threw viewers for a loop with comedic genius and action galore.
I give this movie 9.5 stars out of 10. I have watched every recent Marvel movie. This one certainly tops the “Marvel cake.” A certain villain has a cameo appearance after the end credits, and this will help advance the story into the next sequel: Avengers Infinity War.

This Thursday, Post hosted its annual Greek Sing event where members of Greek life compete to put on the best 15-minute musical performance. This year’s theme was Disney, and three different groups competed with modified versions of classic Disney pieces.
First to the stage was Delta Zeta and Theta Chi, with a performance of “Hercules.” Their performance included the songs, “Go the Distance” and “I Won’t Say I’m in Love.” They were followed by Sigma Delta Tau and Phi Sigma Kappa, with their performance of “Peter Pan.” They performed “I’m Flying” and “I Won’t Grow Up.”
Closing the show was Alpha Epsilon Phi and Tau Kappa Epsilon, who performed “Beauty and the Beast,” singing “Be Our Guest” and “Beauty and the Beast.”
Each group presented choreography and a variety of costumes. In “Hercules” Delta Zeta and Theta Chi changed the script to portray Hercules’ transformation into a frat god in order to return to Mount Olympus. In “Peter Pan,” Peter lives in south campus and the pirates take the shuttle. In “Beauty and the Beast,” Belle sees her father though a magic mirror trapped on campus.
In the end, judges deliberated and decided Delta Zeta and Theta Chi’s performance of “Hercules” the winner of Greek Sing 2017.
“As a freshman who comes from so far away, it was awesome to not only work and get closer with my sisters but with Theta Chi as well. Preparing for Greek Sing was stressful, but the end result was so worth it,” Margaret Levin, freshman musical theatre major and member of Delta Zeta, said.
“Long nights, hard work, and a whole lot of glitter…the perfect combination for us to win Greek Sing,” Chance Bianco, junior nutrition major and member of Theta Chi, said. He feels the work put into the performance helped them win.
Lexi Wiesmann, junior political science major, attended the performance. “It was really great to see everyone getting so into it with Greek Week still a semester away,” she said. Greek Sing is the first of many Greek Week events that will be taking place this year.

Senior year is a difficult time for all. What will I do next? Have I picked the right major? Am I moving back home? Before all of these questions can be answered, the college of liberal arts requires all students to submit a senior thesis which gives fourth-year students the chance to further explore and research in their field.
Many students struggle to settle on a topic within their major. For senior, Hannah Spiegel, senior photography major, it was a seamless construction. Spiegel has a minor in sociology, and many struggle to see the correlation between the topics.
For Spiegel, it was clear. Her interest in sociology, fueled by her enthusiasm for photography, helped her settle on her senior thesis. “My project focuses on interviewing and photographing people from all walks of life and asking them questions regarding their opinions on America,” she said. “I photograph each person during their interview in the hopes of capturing the emotions associated with the topics they’ve chosen to talk about.”
She plans to ask participants what they appreciate about the United States, what would they change about the United States and whether they are happy living here. “The three questions I ask are open-ended in order to give my subjects the freedom to respond in any way they wish,” Spiegel said.
The phrasing and style of Spiegel’s questions show their sociological influence. She provides the interviewee freedom to discuss topics ranging from changes to the socioeconomic status of the U.S., to what they love most about the U.S., even the restaurant chain Chipotle.
Spiegel claimed her topic to be slightly selfish. “I thoroughly enjoy hearing other people’s opinions as much as I enjoy trying to figure out why that person would have such a perspective,” she said. When interviewing, Spiegel wants individuals to consider the different viewpoints. “Our society today is very divided, and people are unwilling to listen to someone if their views are different,” she said.
Now in the process of acquiring her subjects, she has already faced some revelations that have made her rethink her perceptions. “I’ll go into an interview expecting to hear a specific opinion based on my subject’s demographic,” she said. “Then I get told something completely different.”
Although no date is set, Spiegel’s photography exhibition is set to occupy the Student Art League Gallery for a week during the spring semester, between February and March.
Her work can be found on her website, hrsphoto.weebly.com, and daily updates are on her Instagram @_hannahsp.

Supplies: 
Cotton balls or pom-poms Scissors
Yarn
Paper
Glue or tape
Fabric
Curtain rod Iron(optional)
First, fold paper into triangles and cut small shapes into the edges. Take a piece of paper, fold the top edge to meet the opposite corner equally to form a square. Open the square and fold it into a rectangular shape. Then, find the bottom edge and fold one side over from the center. Repeat on the other side and fold over the matching edges. Cut off excess paper at the top of the triangle. Follow the design of your chosen template or cut out shapes of your own to make your own design. To make smaller snowflakes, either use a smaller sheet of paper, or cut a smaller triangle before making a design. You can find template designs on www.pinterest.com. Unfold the page to reveal the finished snowflake.
Once you have cut out all your snowflakes, press out creases with a low-cool iron (Disclaimer: Keep iron setting low as to not create any re hazards). On more intricate snow akes, place a piece of fabric over the snowflake as to not damage it.
Next, tie three to four pieces of string along the curtain rod depending on the size of your window. Make sure they are evenly spaced. Cut each piece of string to match the length of your window. Use either glue or tape, attach a pom-pom or cotton ball every four inches for added decoration. Glue or tape the snowflakes evenly along the string.
Lastly, spread the pieces across the window so that the snowflakes are centered. Add as many as you want to fill up your window. Vary the colors of string and paper as you wish.
With these curtains, you’ll be prepared for the winter holidays.

The Pioneers finish off the season on a high note as they defeated Saint Anselm 45-7 on Saturday, Nov 11. The team ended the season with a 5 game win streak making their final record 8-2 on the season.
The game started off with a bang as the Pioneers were the first to score with a field goal that made the score 3-0. The Pioneers held the Hawks to 175 yards in total. Jake Carlock lead the Pioneer defense with eight tackles. Saint Anselm did not score until the end of the third quarter when they passed for a 7-yard touchdown.
Quarterback, Yianni Gavalas rushed for 23 yards in total throughout the game. Gavalas faced the team that he played with prior to coming to Post. He is a four-year transfer from Saint Anselm College. Gavalas said after the game, “We are disappointed as a team not being able to compete in the playoffs. We feel that we are a playoff caliber team. It was a weird but great experience playing at Saint Anselm again. I got to see old friends and make memories with new ones.”
The Pioneers end their regular season 8-2 and unfortunately will not be continuing their season into the playoffs. Hopefully the football team will do better next season and hopefully win another championship in the future.
