The season for men’s basketball has come to a close after Dowling College defeated the Pioneers at the Pratt Center on Tuesday, March 5 in the first round of the East Coast Conference Tournament. The sixth-seeded Golden Lions edged out the third-ranked Pioneers by a final score of  70-64. The only hope the Pioneers had of making the NCAA Tournament was winning the ECC Tournament. The Golden Lions squashed any hope the Pioneers had of advancing.
With just under one minute left to play in regulation, Pioneers’ senior guard Billy Butler evened the score up at 63. However, the Golden Lions closed out the game with a 7-1 run making clutch shots and not allowing the Pioneers to get into a set offense.
The Pioneers played this game without junior forward Vaughn Allen, a 2013 ECC All-Conference First Team selection. Allen, who started every game but one this season and averaged 15.5 points and 8.7 rebounds, was on the bench but did not enter the game at any point.
The Pioneers appeared to have a difficult time compensating for the loss of Allen as the defense was noticeably impacted and on offense the floor was less spread out. For the entirety of the game, the Pioneers essentially used a six-man rotation. The starters along with freshman guard Emile Blackman consisted of the lineups that head coach Chris Casey slotted into the game. Not having Allen in the game further hurt a team that was already lacking depth.
For Dowling, junior guard Leon Taylor was the difference in the game as he buried the deciding shot in the final seconds and finished the game nailing five of his seven shots from beyond the arc. He led all scorers with 21 points.
The final score may indicate that it was a tight game, but Dowling completely controlled the game from the start. Dowling was much more efficient in three-point percentage than LIU Post. The Golden Lions went 12-25 (48 percent) from beyond the arc, while the Pioneers only shot 4-14 (29 percent). In addition, the Pioneers could not capitalize when they went to the free-throw line. The Pioneers were 16-26 (62 percent) from the charity stripe. On the other hand, the Golden Lions did not get to the line as often but nearly made as many attempts as they shot 12-13 (92 percent).
One of the most eye-popping statistics in this game was the assists by each team. The Golden Lions dished out 19 assists and played to win as a team. The Pioneers were unable to get into a rhythm offensively and had seven assists as a team for the game. There was too much one-on-one, isolations and lack of team continuity to be able to get a win over the Golden Lions.
For the Pioneers, senior guard Billy Butler led the squad in scoring with 14 points. Senior guard Tobin Carberry and sophomore forward Tyuan Williams each added 13 points, but it was not enough to overcome the attack of the Golden Lions.
With the loss, the Pioneers’ season has come to an abrupt end. They needed to win the ECC Tournament to be able to enter the NCAA Tournament. The Pioneers end the 2012-2013 season with an 18-9 record.
The victory by Dowling ends a run of six consecutive appearances in the title game of the ECC Men’s Basketball Championship by the Pioneers. Also with the win, Dowling becomes the first No. 6 seed to reach the conference semifinals in the current tournament format.

LIU Post has prepared for two years for the Middle States Reaccredita­tion evaluation team’s visit to campus from March 18 to March 20, 2013. The Middle Sates team will determine wheth­er the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools will reaccredit the University.
Referring to the Frequently Asked Ques­tions brochure, Middle States defines ac­creditation as, “a peer review process used to sustain and strengthen the quality of colleges, universities and other institutions of higher education. In order to earn and maintain accreditation, colleges or universities must demonstrate to colleagues from peer insti­tutions that it meets or surpasses mutually agreed-upon standards.” Long Island Uni­versity has been accredited by Middle States since 1955.
Middle States uses 14 different standards to evaluate universities. Those 14 standards are: Mission and Goals, Planning, Resource Allocation, and Institutional Renewal, In­stitutional Resources, Leadership and Gov­ernance, Administration, Integrity, Institu­tional Assessment, Student Admissions and Retention, Student Support Services, Faculty, Educational Offerings, General Education, Related Educational Activities and Assess­ment of Student Learning.
On February 26, in the Hillwood Lec­ture Hall during common hour, faculty, staff, alumni and students were invited to partici­pate in an open forum to discuss the upcom­ing Middle States visit. During the meeting, the LIU community was informed that the team would use the 14 standards to determine whether the university’s mission and goals are congruent with its measures of performance and use of resources.
According to Heather Gibbs, assistant vice president and co-chair of the Drafting and Oversight Committee for the Middle States visit, the Middle States Evaluation team is chaired by Dr. Jack Varsalona, presi­dent of Wilmington University. The other nine members of the team come from institu­tions throughout the Middle States Region, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mary­land, Delaware and Washington, D.C.
The team will also travel to LIU Brook­lyn, LIU Brentwood, LIU Riverhead, LIU Hudson and nine other unrelated campuses.
Prior to the Middle States Evaluation team’s visit, the University spent two years preparing a Self Study Report. At the open forum, Provost Paul Forestell described the report as “an evidence-based explanation of what we have done, are doing and will do to meet the fourteen standards.”
The report was written and prepared by the Drafting and Oversight Committee, Mission State Committee and five working groups consisting of faculty, staff and stu­dents, according to Kathleen Morley, univer­sity director of assessment. The 109-page self-study report is available online to anyone with a liu.edu username and password at www.liu.edu/About/Accreditation/Middle-States.
Between Monday, March 18, and Wednesday, March 20, the Middle States team will talk to faculty, schedule meetings with students and conduct random question and answer sessions during common hour to hear students’ thoughts about the Univer­sity. Since the review is implemented every 10 years, it is important for the Middle States Accreditation team to hear if students and staff have or have not noticed changes in the University.
“LIU is proud of the collective effort of the university community in producing the written Self Study Report, which provides evidence of institutional quality and effective­ness,” said Dr. Lori Knapp, co-chair of the Drafting and Oversight Committee for Middle States and deputy vice president for Academic Affairs at LIU.
However, Knapp also revealed that, “Typically, Middle States finds that many institutions can show improvement in the areas of assessment linked to planning and resource allocation.” This means that several colleges, lack strategic planning and resource allocation needed to support the development and change necessary to improve and main­tain institutional quality.
According to Rita Langdon, associate provost for Communications, Public Rela­tions and Marketing, “An oral report will be delivered at the exit interview [where the team will inform the campus community on their personal recommendations] on March 20. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education will issue its official public findings in June 2013.”
According to the Middle States website, if LIU Post is not reaccredited the university will not be eligible for Federal Student Finan­cial, grants and funds.
Freshman Music Education and Music Performance double major KaraAnn Leone said “If LIU loses its financial aid; I probably will not be able to attend Post anymore.” With that said, it is very important that LIU is reac­credited after this visit.

On Friday, May 10, 2013, the commencement ceremony will recognize approximately 2,300 students who completed their degrees 2012, January 2013 and those who have submitted their degree applications for May 2013.
Before the spring semester began, President Steinberg sent an email to students, faculty and staff stating, “Many expressed a sense of loss, fearing that the LIU Post identity would be swallowed up in the larger [University-wide gradu­ation] event.” Therefore, the com­mencement ceremony was moved back to the LIU Post campus.
The Great Lawn ceremony has become a shared experi­ence among LIU Post University alumni and current students. “I am glad that graduation is tak­ing place on campus and not at the Barclays Center,” said Keith Jordan, a graduate student in the Digital Game Design and Devel­opment program, who will be awarded a Master of Arts degree. “I have been looking forward to graduating under the tent since the day I started here.”
The ceremony, according to the Conference Services page on the LIU website, includes a formal procession, a commence­ment speaker and presentation of honorary degrees, recognition of the Valedictorian and Salutato­rian, recognition of distinguished alumni and, most importantly, the conferral of 2,281 degrees total. The guest speakers, Vale­dictorian, Salutatorian and Distinguished Alumni Awards are announced between late March and early April.
Recognition of individual graduates will occur at separate college and school receptions after the main reception. During these smaller ceremonies, each graduate will be recognized by name as he or she crosses the stage.
As graduation approaches, seniors are both anxious and enthusiastic. “On one hand, I am excited my hard work paid off, but I am nervous to be out in the real world and begin looking for jobs,” said senior Broadcasting major and Journalism minor Matthew Applewhite. “I hear so many hor­ror stories about young graduates being unemployed,” he added.
“Even though finishing classes is stressful, I am trying to just enjoy my last few weeks of being a college student,” said se­nior Broadcasting major, Robert Hairston. “I can’t wait until May, when I can hold my diploma in front of my family.”
There are 1,260 are graduate students and 955 are undergrads graduating this May. LIU Post makes up the majority of students graduating with 1,996 and 934 of those are undergrads.
According to LIU Post Reg­istrar’s Beth Carson, LIU River­head has a total of 59 students receiving degrees. Out of those students, 49 are graduate stu­dents and 10 are undergraduate students. LIU Brentwood has 160 total students, 149 graduate and 11 undergraduate.
“The total amount of gradu­ates will increase slightly, as we are still receiving some applica­tions,” said Carson.
Business Administration, Criminal Justice and Psychol­ogy have the highest number of undergraduate majors graduat­ing in the May ceremony. The graduate degrees with the most students include the Master of Business Administration in Busi­ness, Master of Science in Medi­cal Biology and M.S. in Library Science and Information.
This year’s graduation cer­emony will be organized by the Conference Services Office, the Office of the Provost, the Office of the President as well as a Com­mencement Committee com­posed of faculty and staff.
“I am coordinating the Commencement ceremony this year, but the reality is that there is a large group of staff and administrators that take part in the planning of the event,” said Carson. Despite the recent changes, the ceremony day and process will be the same as pre­vious years.
From March 26 to April 27, graduating students will be able to pick up their graduation tickets from the campus book­store. However, students must first purchase their cap and gown in order to receive tickets. Seat­ing under the tent is limited and therefore graduating students are only allowed four guests. Graduating students are advised to check the LIU Post website for updates regarding the ceremony.
LIU Post expects 10,000 people to attend the ceremony, including the graduates, family, visitors and LIU Post faculty and staff. The ceremony will also in­clude graduates from Long Island University’s campuses in River­head and Brentwood.
“Graduation is a time of great celebration for the university, our graduates and their families,” said Provost Paul Forestell. “It allows all of us to gather together to salute the academic accomplish­ments of our students.”

February was Black History Month and there were reminders all over campus, but there were very few in the classroom. This is partly due to the fact there are very few African-American pro­fessors at LIU Post. According to the LIU Office of Institutional Research, the diversity of LIU Post students is as follows: 62 percent White; 12 percent Black, Non-His­panic; 13 percent Asian/Pacific Is­lander; 13 percent Hispanic. With such a diverse student population, one question comes to mind: Is the same diversity evident among faculty members?
From the viewpoint of many students, the answer to that ques­tion is no. Few students, other than those who have taken classes in either the music or dance de­partments, can say that they have had an African-American profes­sor during their time at Post. A January graduate from the Music Education program, Christina Montalto stated, “I have to say there are a lot of ethnic profes­sors…. other than white and black. But yeah, outside of the Music department, I don’t think I had any black Professors.”
Junior Adolescence Educa­tion major, Tynesha Jones, seems to be an exception to this rule. She has had two African profes­sors, one for Psychology and another for an Education class. When asked if she thought that African-Americans were under­represented on our faculty, she responded, “Yes, I do think so.”
Senior Public Relations ma­jor, Brittany Scelza, agreed with Jones. Although neither the Uni­versity nor the C.W. Post Collegial Federation, which is the union for LIU Post faculty members, would provide the Pioneer with the number of Black professors at Post, Scelza offered an interesting perspective concerning the num­ber African-American professors on campus. “If you think about it, we probably have somewhere near forty professors during our four years at LIU Post,” she said. “I’ve only had three black profes­sors and two of them are no lon­ger working there.” According to Scelza’s account, African-Ameri­can professors have accounted for 7.5 percent of her in-class experi­ence at Post. In her case, at least, that 7.5 percent is not equal to the 12 percent of the student popula­tion that is “black.”
In its Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, Long Island University declares that it is committed to, “equal opportu­nity in employment and to the opportunity for advancement of all qualified individuals with­out discrimination due to race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, veteran status, disability, marital status or citizenship.” So why is it that certain students experience the complete opposite? Is there failure on the part of the Univer­sity to hire these individuals? Or are there not enough of them out there in the hiring pool of schol­ars to choose from? And if in fact they are out there, is LIU Post an attractive destination for them?
When presented with these tough questions, numerous faculty members and administrators directed the Pioneer to Rita Lang­don, Post’s Associate Provost of Communications, Public Relations & Marketing. Langdon did not provide any statistics about the ethnicity of the faculty at LIU Post. However, Langdon did issue an official statement about the Uni­versity’s hiring practices on behalf of Dr. Jeffrey Kane, Vice President of Academic Affairs for LIU.
In his statement, Kane mentioned that, “Increasing the diversity of faculty is a joint re­sponsibility of the faculty them­selves, the academic deans and the University.” He also stated that it is primarily the faculty’s duty to conduct searches for new faculty members. Amidst teach­ing classes, conducting their own research, and sharing that research with their peers, current faculty members are expected to go searching for new faculty members. How much time can they truly dedicate to searching for new faculty members who aren’t already a part of their so­cial circles?
Dr. Barbara Fowles, Chair­person for the Department of Media Arts, commented on the matter. “I think that the people in the University administration would like to have more minor­ity group members on the faculty and in university administration, but sometimes in order to expand the faculty in these directions, a little flexibility in evaluating their resumes is needed, and that seems to be a stumbling block here.”
Dr. Fowles suggested solu­tion seems to have some merit. In order to become a full-time tenured professor at LIU Post, one must obtain a doctoral degree in his/ her respective field. Accord­ing to data collected from the Sur­vey of Earned Doctorates, which is a federal survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Cen­ter, African Americans accounted for about four percent of all doc­toral degrees earned in the United States during the year 2011.
In compliance with Univer­sity requirements, there are very few qualified African American candidates to choose from. But, does being an expert in a particu­lar field of study automatically mean that an individual is an effective educator? Could there be a case made for “under-qualified” individuals as effective educators?
Once again, Scelza, thought so. During her time at Post, Scel­za has had three black professors, two of whom no longer work at the school. One of the two profes­sors that Scelza was referring to is Dorothy Reed, who she claimed to be, “hands down the most influential and caring teacher I’ve (ever) had.” Reed, who is Black, used to head the Journalism pro­gram, but left the University after being denied tenure. After much research, the Pioneer learned that Reed was not denied tenure purely because of her ethnicity, but rather because she failed to obtain a PhD within the allotted time. When contacted for more information on the matter, Reed declined to comment.
LIU remains committed to, “equal opportunity in employ­ment and to the opportunity for advancement of all qualified in­dividuals,” according to its Equal Opportunity Employment Policy. The more pressing question here seems to be: Has an attempt to recruit some of academia’s most decorated scholars snubbed some of this generation’s most influen­tial educators, hurting students in the process?

Spring break is next week and we all have somewhere to be. Being a college student means money is tight. There isn’t much cash left over after the price of a hotel, spending money and airfare. A road trip sounds like a good idea to save a little cash at first, until you’re four hours in and want to kick your friends out of the car. You may want to look over these guidelines to ensure that by the time you get to your destination with your friends, you still want to spend time with them.
To start, get your car checked. You want to make sure that your car is in great travel condition before you take it out on a long trip. Get the oil changed, check all the fluids and make sure your tires are safe. Remember to put things like a jack and jumper cables in the trunk. There is no bigger mood killer than being stuck on the side of the highway instead of at your destination.
Pool money for gas before you leave (also suggested for toll money). Make a set amount everyone has to put in. Always make the amount more than you think so you don’t find yourself short for gas money on your way home. Doing this will make gas pump visits less aggravating while avoiding the arguments of who’s turn it is to pay. At the end of the trip, any left-over cash can be split between everyone.
The GPS is a great device, but technology is not always the most reliable. Aside from it not having service in some areas, maps are not always updated. Also, if it breaks, gets lost or stolen, you just lost your only sense of direction. Always bring a map. It won’t hurt to have a second set of directions.
Keep snacks in the car. Go shopping with your friends the night before the trip. This kills two birds with one stone: First, you won’t have to stop as much to get food. Just fill a cooler with ice, and put all your food in it. Second, people get cranky when their hungry, so this can eliminate confrontations within the car. Not to mention the money you’ll save not having to buy overpriced food at all the rest stops.
Always use the restroom when you have the chance. We have all experienced that one annoying person who needs to use the bath­room right after you leave the rest area. This also gives you a chance to stretch your legs after being crammed in a car for hours.
Encourage your friends to bring all the technological devices and books that they desire. We all have different tastes in music, and fighting over the radio can be very distracting to the driver. Everyone should bring their iPods, iPads, books, and video games. These are great things to keep people entertained when conversation dies down in the car.
Be safe. Drive the speed limit. You may be in a hurry to get to your destination, but go the pace. A speeding ticket is the last thing you want to worry about after having to pay off an enormous bar tab. Also, keep a first aid kit in the car; you never know what could happen. If you’re the driver and you’re getting sleepy, don’t be afraid to ask some­one to take over for a bit. Always make sure that at least one cell phone in the car is fully charged at all times. You can’t call for assis­tance if everyone’s cell phone is dead.
Have fun with the road trip. Instead of viewing it as a chore, look at it as a part of your vacation. Enjoy the drive with good company. These rules should help eliminate unwanted frustration. Relax, have fun, soak up sun and make the most of spring break 2013.

The winners weren’t the only ones who received a lot of attention at this year’s Academy Awards ceremony on February 24. Seth MacFarlane, the creator of “Fam­ily Guy” and director of the movie “Ted,” hosted this year’s event and left people shocked as he went from one inappropriate joke to another. Some people think MacFar­lane went too far, while others praise him as the best host of all time.
MacFarlane started off the night with some extreme jokes. One of the most mem­orable of the night is probably when he pre­sented the movie “Django Unchained” and made a reference to the scandalous couple Chris Brown and Rihanna. He stated, “This is the story of a man fighting to get back his woman, who’s been subjected to unthink­able violence. Or as Chris Brown and Rihan­na call it, a date movie”. Despite the poor response from the audience for that harsh attack, MacFarlane continued with his racy humor.
When talking about the 9-year-old ac­tress Quvenzhane Wallis, MacFarlane told the audience that she is so young that it will take 16 years until she’s too old for actor George Clooney, referring to his taste in young women.
And so the jokes went on, from saying that no one cares what actresses, such as Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek, say be­cause they’re attractive, to saying that last year’s winner of best actor Jean Dujardin is now old news, to stating that Jews control Hollywood.
However, MacFarlane did not only host with inappropriate jokes. The night’s theme was musicals, and he really kept that part of the show classy… for the most part. His mu­sical number “We Saw Your Boobs,” where MacFarlane pointed out actresses that have gone topless on camera, got a mixed response. Some feminists were outraged, since the Academy Awards should be about acknowledging the art behind the movies, not who showed their breasts on screen. However, he quickly turned it around with the help of Charlize Theron and Channing Tatum. MacFarlane sang while the actress and actor danced in the background, fol­lowed by a musical number with the help of Daniel Radcliffe and Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Andrew Barell, junior Film major, said that MacFarlane didn’t go too far. He believes that MacFarlane’s jokes were not shocking, “There was no point in the show where I was blown away by his offensive language.” He continued, “I think he was calm and collected.”
Galjaar Nerway, senior Film major, agreed. “He’s a very funny and talented man. He has a couple of good shows and he is now a billionaire and he got there all by himself. No one gave that to him.” Nerway stated that MacFarlane’s hosting was en­tertaining. However, he understood why he might have offended people and why people believe he went too far. “People can lose their sense of humor. The mentality that it’s only funny when it’s about other people is why people don’t like him,” he said.
Chrissy Sire, also a senior Film major, says she’s not a fan of MacFarlane, but he did not offend her even though he goes a little too far sometimes. “He didn’t push it further than other things he has done.”
MacFarlane might have gone too far, but his off-color humor and charm pro­duced the Academy Awards’ best ratings in years. Maybe it is time for Hollywood to get off its high horse and let the dark humor peek in a little. His jokes might have been racy, but it might be just what people want.

On February 24, the 85th Annual Os­car Awards occurred at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles. It will be remembered as an evening of many unexpected features. Host Seth MacFarlane entertained with witty jokes, Best Actress winner Jennifer Lawrence fell on her dress and First Lady Michelle Obama announced the Best Picture award from the White House via satellite.
Then there was a limping Kristen Stew­art, best known for the “Twilight Saga,” who presented the award for Best Production Design. Paired up with Daniel Radcliffe, bet­ter known as Harry Potter, Stewart left her crutches behind and limped her way down the stage to the microphone even though she was visibly affected by the foot injury she incurred from stepping on broken glass.
The ceremony’s Best Actress in a Lead­ing Role winner also made a significant entrance. When Jennifer Lawrence was announced as the winner of one of the Acad­emy’s most prestigious prizes for her perfor­mance as Tiffany in “Silver Linings Playbook,” the 22-year-old accidently tripped on her Cinderella-style bone-white dress and fell on her way up the stage. After a short pause, she stood up, excused herself for what she called “a very embarrassing entrance” and gave her many thanks for her first golden statuette.
The Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role went to Daniel Day-Lewis for his inter­pretation of Abraham Lincoln in “Lincoln.” Steven Spielberg’s 150-minute-long movie about one of the most renowned presidents in American history was a favorite to win Best Picture, but instead Ben Affleck and his team behind “Argo” claimed the coveted prize.
Argo, about a U.S. Government agent’s idea to use a fake Hollywood film produc­tion as a cover to go into Iran and rescue six Americans during the hostage crisis of 1979, grossed more than $250 million worldwide since premiering in winter 2012.
A familiar but unexpected face appeared on a large screen via satellite to announce the award for Best Picture. Dressed in a metal­lic sleeveless dress by designer Naeem Khan, First Lady Michelle Obama smiled and ad­dressed the audience from the Diplomatic Room of the White House.
There were well-known faces among the other presenters. Many were Oscar winners from last year, like Octavia Spencer (“The Help”), Christopher Plummer (“Beginners”) and Meryl Streep (“The Iron Lady”). Jennifer Aniston, Sandra Bullock and Jack Nicholson were presenters as well.
Halle Berry, who in 2002 starred in the Bond movie “Die Another Day,” appeared in a metallic body-hugging Versace dress, to introduce a tribute to the Bond movies and the movies’ soundtracks. Shirley Bassey then sang “Goldfinger” from the 1964 movie of the same name and then Adele performed “Sky­fall” from the latest Bond installment. The 24-year-old British singer-songwriter won this year’s Oscar for Best Original Song for “Skyfall.”
The cast of “Les Miserables” performed a song from the musical-turned-movie, based on the novel by Victor Hugo. Hollywood ac­tors and actresses like Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried and Anne Hathaway were among the singers featured. Hathaway also walked home with the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Fan­tine.
And then there was Seth MacFarlane, who was asked to host the Academy Awards in order to attract a younger audience. The actor, voice-actor, comedian and singer who created Family Guy in 1997 and later made box office success “Ted” drew much attention because of his witty jokes. Among them were a song about actresses’ breasts and a compari­son between “Django Unchained” and Chris Brown and Rihanna’s stormy relationship.
The day after the Oscars, the Twitter­sphere, along with numerous media out­lets across America, had MacFarlane in the headlines. Some questioned if he went too far, even playing on sexism, while others praised his ability to lighten up the show.
The 85th Annual Academy Awards was an evening of many unexpected events and untraditional features. The things that usu­ally remain the same year after year did just that. There was the traditional spectacle over dresses, who wore what, by whom and why, the in memoriam tribute to some of the film industry’s most important contributors who passed away in 2012 and some of Hollywood’s elite bringing home the statuettes.

Tonight at 7:00 p.m. at the Pratt Recreation Cen­ter, the Lady Pioneers will hope to continue their season as they host the Saint Thomas Aquinas Lady Spartans in the first round of the East Coast Conference Tournament. The Lady Pioneers (18-8, 11-7) enter as the fourth seed and therefore, will welcome in the fifth-seeded Lady Spartans (13-15, 9-9).
In their most recent game, the Lady Pioneers lost on the road to Molloy College by a final score of 64-57. However, before that, LIU Post had won four consecutive games including a victory over the NYIT Lady Bears who were ranked No. 17 in the country at the time.
The easiest way to describe the Lady Spartans is to say that they are a streaky team. Since the calendar flipped to 2013, the Lady Spartans started on a three game winning streak, followed by a four game losing streak, leading to a five game win­ning streak, and closing out the regular season on a four game losing streak. Not exactly the momentum a team is looking for heading into a tournament, but the Lady Spartans are looking for revenge.
In both meetings this sea­son against the Lady Pioneers, STAC has been smacked around. In the first meeting on January 23, the Lady Pioneers went on the road and cruised their way to a 67-51 victory. Just a couple weeks ago on February 20, the Lady Pioneers once again domi­nated, this time on their home floor, resulting in a 65-41 win.
However, going back to last season, the two teams split the two games and each won on its home court. The last time the Lady Spartans beat the Lady Pioneers at the Pratt Center was two years ago on January 27, 2011 when the STAC edged out a 52-51 win.
For the Lady Pioneers to beat STAC and advance into the second round to face the top-ranked Dowling Golden Lions (23-3, 17-1), the key is to win the battle of the rebounds. This sea­son, when out-rebounding their opponent, the Lady Pioneers have a record of 17-3. Of course, a major reason why teams win games, especially playoff games, is taking care of the basketball. When the Lady Pioneers have committed fewer turnovers than their opponent, they have a record of 7-4. Although limit­ing turnovers is vital, the better barometer to gauge the success of the Lady Pioneers is through seeing the difference in re­bounding.
If LIU Post goes far in the tournament, it will need sopho­more guard Chelsea Williams to step up like she’s been play­ing the final few games of the season. Williams did not play in the season finale against Mol­loy due to an injury, but in three of her last four games she has dropped at least 15 points. In her last game, she had arguably her most impressive and most clutch performance of the season with 19 points (6-9 from the floor, 3-4 from beyond the arc) and nine rebounds against NYIT.
For the season, senior for­ward Nicolette Marciniak is aver­aging 14 points and 9.6 rebounds per game, fifth and fourth best in the conference, respectively. When Marciniak grabs at least 10 rebounds, the Lady Pioneers have a record of 7-4.
Something else to watch out for is the play of junior guard Alexis Peters. She handles the basketball frequently and routinely sets up the offense. In games where she has more assists than turnovers, the Lady Pioneers have a record of 7-2.
The player to keep an eye on for the Lady Spartans is senior guard Shpresa Liharevic. She averages 13 points per night and ranks third in the ECC shooting 38 percent for the season from three-point range.
Tipoff for tonight’s game is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. There will be a 6:15 p.m. pregame on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org. If the Lady Pioneers win tonight, they will advance into the second round and go on the road to face Dowling College on Friday, March 8 with a 6:00 p.m. start time. The championship game is scheduled for Sunday, March 10 at the gym of the highest remain­ing seed left in the tournament with a 1:00 p.m. tipoff.

The women’s basketball team was unable to close out the regular season on a five game win streak, as it dropped its final game on Saturday, March 2 on the road against the Molloy Lions 64-57. With the loss, the Lady Pioneers have an 18-8 overall record, with an 11-7 record within the conference. They head into the East Coast Conference Tour­nament, which begins tonight, as the fourth seed against Saint Thomas Aquinas College (13-15).
Against the Lions, neither squad could get into an offensive rhythm through the first half as the score was evened up at 22 at the break. Both teams traded buckets during the final 20 min­utes of play, but the Lions made the shots when it counted late in the contest. During the final 5:40 of the second half, the Lions went on a 17-8 run, smothering the Lady Pioneers on defense and hit­ting shots on offense.
Junior guard Alexis Peters led the Lady Pioneers in three categories with 14 points, 12 rebounds and four assists. With her performance, Peters regis­tered her first double-double of the season. Junior guard Jalicia Connell was the only other Lady Pioneer in double figures as she added 10 points on 4-10 shooting from the field.
Senior forward Nicolette Marciniak had a rough after­noon, going 3-10 from the floor scoring only seven points; the least she has scored in a game dating back to the sixth game of the year against Pace University on December 8 when she had only five points. Although she struggled shooting the ball, Mar­ciniak hauled in 13 rebounds, which is the eleventh time she has grabbed at least 10 rebounds in a game this season.
The biggest reason the Lady Pioneers did not win the game against Molloy was due to the poor shooting display as a team. The Lady Pioneers went 21-68 (31 percent) from the floor, and had next to no luck from beyond the arc as their 3-25 clip (12 per­cent) would indicate. In addition, the Lady Pioneers also did not win the rebounding battle, which is a key to victory for LIU Post. The two teams actually tied each other with 47 rebounds apiece.
The Lady Pioneers begin the first round of the ECC Tour­nament tonight at 7:00 p.m. at the Pratt Recreation Center against the Saint Thomas Aqui­nas Lady Spartans. Pregame begins at 6:15 p.m. on 88.1 FM and WCWP.org.

The men’s basketball team wrapped up the 2012-13 regular season with a 75-67 win over the Molloy Lions on Saturday, March 2. LIU Post ends the year with an 18-8 overall record and a 13-5 record in the East Coast Conference. The Pioneers’ record was good enough for them to secure the third seed in the upcoming ECC Tournament.
In the win on Saturday, the Pioneers shot 50 percent (25-50) from the field and 52 percent (9-17) from three-point range. Senior guard Tobin Carberry had another solid performance putting up 21 points and contributing three assists. Freshman guard Dillon Burns added 16 points of his own and six assists and junior forward Vaughn Allen contributed 11 points in the victory. Fresh­man Guard Emile Blackman scored 19 points off the bench.
Like LIU Post’s previous two games, the first half was a back and forth battle. Senior forward Vukasin Vlajic put the first points on the board for Molloy 1:20 into the game. Blackman quickly tied the game back up af­ter two-made free throws. The two ball clubs traded the lead five different times and the game was tied three different times.
At the 10:33 mark, LIU Post went on an 8-0 run ignited by a three-pointer by Blackman. The Pioneers reached their larg­est lead of the half with 4:26 left in the first half after Allen gave them a 36-26 advan­tage. But the Lions immediately responded and cut LIU Post’s lead to 39-37 by the end of the half.
Molloy junior forward John Petrucelli opened the second half by tying the game at 39 with a layup. Pioneers’ sophomore for­ward Tyuan Williams and Carberry hit back-to-back shots to give the Pioneers the lead 45-41. But by the 14:26 mark the Lions had roared back to tie the game at 47.
Blackman put them back ahead by two, but the Lions quickly gained control and eventually took a 56-49 lead. However, no lead is ever safe and the Pioneers battled back as the game wound down. Pioneers’ se­nior guard Billy Butler’s layup tied the game for the third time in the second half. The Pio­neers would again take the lead, and again, the Lions found a way to tie the game up.
But, the Pioneers pulled ahead for good off a jumper by Burns, and LIU Post held onto the lead for the final 2:49 of the game to capture the 75-67 win. Now that the season has come to a close, the Pioneers turn their focus to protect their title as reigning ECC champions. Last year, they entered the tour­nament as the number one seed and defeated both Dowling College and Bridgeport.
Ironically, the Pioneers will again open the tournament against Dowling, although this year LIU Post enters as the three seed. Dowling and the Pioneers play on Tuesday, March 5, with the winner will move on to play second-ranked NYIT on Thursday.

LIU Post’s women’s swim team has had a successful season and is coming off an impressive showing at the Metropolitan Conference Meet that took place from Feb­ruary 15-17.
The Pioneers were crowned the Metro­politan Champions over both Division I and Divison II schools. The Pioneers had their way with the individual awards and took home all of them. Junior, Tamara Garriock, was named Swimmer of the Meet, freshman Joyce Kwok was named Rookie of the Meet, and 11th year head coach Maureen Travers was recognized as Women’s Coach of the Year.
The Pioneers won 15 of the 18 events, and finished with a total score of 1298. The colleges that finished second and third were the College of New Jersey and Southern Connecticut State with 1021 and 906 points, respectively.
One of the notable accomplishments during the event, during the 200-yard breaststroke Garriock grabbed first-place setting a new personal best time, as well as school, conference and meet records with a time of 2:17.59.
In the 200-yard backstroke, sophomore Johanna Pettersson took home first place with a time of 2:01.74.
Featured in the 400-yard freestyle relay were four Pioneers: Garriock, Pettersson, Kwok, and freshman Meghan Brazier. The group finished in first setting new school, conference, and meet records with a final time of 3:24.56.
In the 100-yard freestyle seven differ­ent Pioneers competed, but it turned out that Brazier yet again finished in first with her time of 52.67.
“Our team has been working very hard this season,” said senior captain Sandra Luiga. “[We have] held a strong and positive team spirit through every meet and practice which I think is what the LIU Post Pioneers is all about.”

You may have heard about the Triathlon, an event that com­bines three basic sports: run­ning, cycling and swimming. You may also have heard about the Biathlon which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shoot­ing. But, have you ever heard about Chessboxing? No? Well it is exactly what it sounds like, a combination between two of the oldest forms of competition we have seen.
So how does it work? A full Chessboxing match consists of eleven rounds: six rounds of chess and five rounds of boxing in alternating order. The match starts with a four minute round of chess, followed by a three minute round of boxing. The match can be won in three different ways: first, by a knockout or a referee’s decision in a boxing round; sec­ond, by achieving a checkmate, or third, if the opponent’s total of twelve minutes reacting time runs out during a chess round. Warn­ings are issued if a competitor stalls a losing chess game to focus on the boxing. If more than three warnings are given to one player, the opponent wins the game.
Boxing was intro­duced as an Olympic sports by the ancient Greeks as early as 688 BC. Chess originates from India before the 6th century AD. The combination of the two has a much later origin, as the earliest refer­ences to the sports is from London in 1978, when two brothers started Chess­boxing in a regular boxing club. Still, the man who is known for inventing the sport is artist Enki Bilal. He introduced it in one of his comic books in 1992.
The sport is governed by the World Chessboxing Organization and oper­ates under the strapline: “The smartest, toughest (wo)man on the planet”. The WCBO arranged the first World Champion­ship in 2003, and Tihomir Atanassov Dovramadjiev of Bul­garia conquered Andreas Schnei­der of Germany, in the seventh (chess) round. The most recent world champion is Nikolay Sazhin, who won the title in July 2012.
To avoid former boxers to dominate the sport, there is a re­quirement all chess boxers must meet. They need to hold a “Class A” strength as a Chess player. To meet this requirement you need an ELO rating between 1800-1999. This equals a lower expert level, meaning you have to have a great talent for two sports to be able to compete at an internation­al and national level.
If you feel you have what it takes between the ears and in the gloves, jump on the LIRR down to New York City, as there are currently no listed chess box­ing clubs on Long Island. NYC Chessboxing is located in Green­wich Village in Gotham Gym on Washington Street.

Although “Mutant Blobs Attack” came out this past summer, I finally had the chance to play this unexpected gem. “Mutant Blobs Attack” was developed by DrinkBox Studios and it was originally available on the PlaySta­tion Vita, but now has a port for PC on Steam.
It is basically a side-scrolling platformer, semi-puzzle style game where the player is the blob monster. The blob monster is trapped in a laboratory and wants to break out. It gets it’s chance to escape into the backpack of a college student whose class was visiting the lab on a field trip. From there, as a tiny blob, the player travels the college campus, the town and a military base on a rampage of destruction, eating everything in sight. As it grows in size, it eventually eats humans.
The levels require a good understand­ing of the controls whether you are using a controller or your keyboard. At one point, the blob monster has a magnetic field around its body and the player has to use it to scale metal pipes and jump from sections to avoid spikes that can kill it. This requires good tim­ing and precision with the controls. It will not take too long for players to grow accustomed to it. The game even gives players hints and reminders in the easier beginning levels. The graphics are cartoon-like and simple but very charming and colorful. The levels have a lot of variation.
The animation of the monster was done very well and looks just like a blob monster should. I like that at each level, you can play over and over to find hidden blob monsters and get a better score. There are plenty of opportunities to replay levels until you fi­nally get star ratings on them. There is a lot of variety and at some points, the player has to maneuver in the air with magnetic polar­ity using telekinesis to move objects around. The levels are not too long but players cannot save. This means that players must finish the level in order to save their gram, which can be a bit annoying especially if you want to start right back in that section.
Overall, “Mutant Blobs Attack” is a fantastic little game for an affordable price. It is a fun platformer, which uses the 50’s monster theme. This makes the game seem campy and charming, but it also presents a decent challenge. I give this game an 8.5 out of 10. It is available for $7.99 on Steam and on PlayStation Vita.

Reading the Spiderman comics and watching the movies while growing up left me feeling attached to the story and char­acters Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. Because I already had this attachment, I had high expectations for the Spiderman-themed Broadway musical, “Spi­der-Man: Turn Off the Dark.”
How does one make a story that demands many special ef­fects into a musical? I was afraid it was going to be awkward. The set made me think it was going to be a high school musical, not a Broadway show. However, as the story went on, the effects and the acting improved and I finally relaxed.
Reeve Carney interpreted his role as Peter Parker well, making the audience believe he was a nerd without friends and hopelessly in love with Mary Jane. Rebecca Faulkenberry, as the beautiful Mary Jane, was equally good and acted like a love-struck teenager with a twist of her own personality.
The gene-mutated Norman Osborn, played by Robert Cuc­cioli, and his mutated crowd re­minded me a little bit of the band Kiss. Once I looked past that, the acting became more realistic and alive. In fact, his lines were by far the funniest in the show.
Overall, the set was amaz­ing. It featured the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and a bunch of yellow cabs, which gave the audience the feeling of being in New York City. The acrobatics was breathtaking. The actors were swinging and dancing in the air right above the audi­ence’s heads, making me want to either catch a ride with them or hide my face.
The International Student Services hosted the trip to Fox­woods Theatre to see “Spider­man: Turn Off the Dark” on Thursday, February 28. The students were happy to spend the evening on Broadway.
“I thought it was great, and the different Spiderman actors looked hot,” said junior Econom­ics major, Martine Melde, who said she was disappointed she did not receive an after-party invitation.
“I loved it but I wish there was more dancing, more chore­ography,” said junior Accounting major, Vibeke Aarstad.
Overall, “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” was a good show. A 10-year-old boy was sitting behind me and he enthu­siastically called his mother to explain how happy he was. If I was a child again, I believe this musical would have been even better. In other words, it is a great show for parents to take their children to.

Only a handful of films were nominated for Best Picture this year, while thousands more were produced. Here are four films that were not a hit at the Oscars but still deserve some appreciation.
1.) “Moonrise Kingdom” – Nominated for Best Original Screenplay
Wes Anderson’s runaway love story is a refreshingly cute tale that feels nostalgic in a good way. This film chronicles the events on the fictional island of New Penzance before, during and after a “his­toric” storm arrives during one 1960s summer. Anderson, who wrote the film with Roman Coppola, unleashes a cast of characters who parody conventions of love and age as the young manic-depressive Suzy (Kara Hayward) and orphaned Boy Scout Sam (Jared Gilman) run away together into the wilderness. “Moonrise Kingdom” is a fan­tastically humorous display of how a simple plot of two youths can go awry and effectively throw a whole island into frenzy.
2.) “Looper” – No Nominations 
This sci-fi noir film has the right mix of elements that cater to action-lovers and artsy intellectuals alike. Not often do we see a time travel film that interestingly spins the genre, but “Looper” does just that. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a hired killer whose marks are sent back in time from the future. This effectively rids the future contrac­tors of all evidence. While the concept may seem a bit farfetched, this film contained many twists and turns that make it a standout selec­tion from 2012. If you like sci-fi and action, then you will like this movie. If you like sci-fi and action with meaningful characters, then you will love this movie.
3.) “The Impossible”
– Best Actress Nominee, Naomi Watts 
It was no wonder why Naomi Watts received a Best Actress nomination for her work in this film. Adapted from the heart-wrenching story of a family that survived the horrendous 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami is deep in emotional sequences. Watts por­trays a mother who is separated from her husband (Ewan McGregor) and two youngest sons after the Tsunami wreaks hell on their trip in Thailand. Watts and her eldest son, Lucas (Tom Holland) venture to find the rest of their family. “The Impossible” was directed and written by the team behind the Spanish-Language horror film “The Orphanage.” While it is not considered a horror film, “The Impos­sible” is certainty scary and thrilling on an emotional level because of the raw intensity and criticality of the story. Impressive yet was the sound design of the film, especially during the intense sequences of the tsunami and Watts as she screams for her on screen family among chaos.
4.) “Seven Psychopaths” – No Nominations 
Hollywood has produced some introspective work in the past 15 years. Films like “Adaptation” and even this year’s Best Picture-winning “Argo” have displayed a satire of their creators. The film industry sometimes steps back and pokes fun at itself. And with the release of “Seven Psychopaths” came that concept to a new extreme. “Psychopaths” brings us Colin Farrell as a struggling screenwriter named Marty whose newest story collects a slew of maniacal charac­ters he called “psychopaths.” Marty’s best friend, Billy Buckle (Sam Rockwell) is an unemployed actor who lives off the reward money for lost dogs that he kidnaps and returns. Everything goes haywire when a violent gangster (Woody Harrelson) searches for his stolen dog and Marty begins to see his psychopathic screenplay characters literally coming to life. Marty becomes entangled in an escalating mess that makes this film an enjoyable black comedy. This was definitely one of the most fun, quirky and original films of 2012.

Sugar Daddy: An older rich man who gives young women money for companion­ship….Or so they say. Recently CNN.com posted an article covering the topic of the average sugar baby. These are young college women who seek beneficial relationships with older men to help pay their way for college.
One of the most famous sugar daddy websites says that 44 percent of their users are female college students. Have times really become that difficult that college women are resorting to this? For years, people have been going to school, maintaining a social life, working, and graduating with a college de­gree. This is not a safe option to pay the bills.
Meeting random people online is never something that is recommended. There is always the possibility of something going wrong (your safety, their true identity etc.). Also, you can never truly tell what a persons real incentive for meeting up is. For example, the site claims to be companionship for men, and yet it has several different teasing head­lines, some reading: “Spoil them and they’ll spoil you,” “Just looking for a girl who likes to have fun“ and “Lets see where the night goes“. You can even look through some of the members, most of the profiles are written with the insinuation of something more than just companionship.
“It’s kind of like dumb to say that the night is not going to end up in sex. Even if it’s not included that is what they are looking for. They are paying for company, but you got to be kidding, it’s not really just for company. They want something more out of it,” said Sebastian Pascagaza, a sophomore Vocal Per­formance major.
After I read the article on CNN, it was hard for me to believe that this kind of thing was actually going on, and that there was a website publicizing it. Men are really giving out money to have a “dinner date” with wom­en; while women are soliciting themselves.
Simone Costa, a freshman English major said,“ I think its just wrong and disgusting and gross. Young girls should not be doing this just to get money from men, and the men should not be doing this either. Its just wrong and undermining and it should not be al­lowed, they should take the website down.”
“I would not do this. I mainly go about my choices through a criminal justice per­spective because I want to be a cop and I just see this as a form of prostitution. I think they should crack down on this site like it is pros­titution,” expressed Melissa Renner, a sopho­more Criminal Justice major.
Depending on others to pay your bills can cause many is­sues. First, this gives the person who is handing you money lots of control. You may then find your­self in a position having to determine how far you will go for money. Also, you won’t feel that liber­ating feeling of being independent, which may cause your self-esteem to become nonexistent. There are many ways to pay for school, without having to literally put yourself out there.
Brian Harrigan, senior Psychology major said, “Its sad that girls would do that because I guess they feel the need for money, and they need money so much that they are willing to use somebody else for money. They [older men] are just as sad, or even more sad.”
These sites almost don’t seem legal. The man who launched the website, Steven Pasterneck, claims that there is nothing il­legal and that the relationships are mutually beneficial. Pasterneck, being the creator of the site, would of course see nothing wrong with this and his idea of women and rela­tionships seems to be a little off stating in the CNN article, “ I think you can say basi­cally any guy who wants to impress a woman is a sugar daddy.” Well, not all of us feel the need to pay someone to spend time with us, and not all of us chase men for money. Some people do meet, genuinely like and care for one another and enjoy each other’s company.
Is this site really “helping struggling women” like it claims? Or is this just a cleaver way that society has sugar coated a larger issue?

Without a doubt it has been a crazy year for us here in New York; from Hur­ricane Sandy to Nemo. We all have this well-deserved break, but rather than sleep­ing the whole break away there are a lot of productive activities we can partake in as well. Volunteering is a productive way to spend your break. Not only are you doing something constructive with you time, it’s doing something meaningful and meeting new people – all while helping people who can really use it.
Spring break doesn’t mean book a flight to some place warm and party all day. It’s a break for everyone to do something that we all enjoy and getting a break from the normal everyday routine. Anyone can volunteer in their hometowns. Do activities over break like volunteering at a local soup kitchen, tak­ing part in an adopt a highway event, getting involved in fundraisers to raise money for a cause, or even donating clothes and canned food to a local shelter.
LIU Post has had their annual alterna­tive Spring Break program, where students have spent their break in Louisiana, helping out the victims from Hurricane Katrina. Stu­dents have been building homes and helping anyway they can. Jeanette Murray, who is the coordinator for this event said, “Instead of our annual Spring Break trip to Louisiana where we work on homes effected by the hurricanes, we’ve put together a ‘Give Where You Live’ week. So many people in our local community are still struggling with the ef­fects of Super-storm Sandy. If students can spend some time during their Spring Break to lend a hand, it makes a real difference in the lives of people struggling to rebuild and return to their homes.”
Our homes and communities mean a lot to all of us and we can’t forget to think about what has happened in the past few months here in New York. We all deserve this upcoming Spring Break next week, but it doesn’t mean that we can’t also spend some time to help out and volunteer.
Whether you are going away, staying on campus, doing homework or volunteer­ing. Just make sure you enjoy the break and make sure it is a memorable one.

With spring break ap­proaching, students this week are preparing for and taking mid­term exams. Some professors, though, in place of midterms, have assigned students work or projects to complete over the break. Although the use of school recesses for review projects isn’t unheard of, some students op­pose the idea, claiming it defeats the purpose of having a spring recess. The purpose of the distrib­uted spring break assignments is to help sharpen the skills and information that students have developed during the beginning of the spring semester, and to en­sure remembrance once they are back into the class routine.
Joshua Libal, a sophomore Business major with a minor in Music, said, “I don’t think there should be any work given during a break. That’s our time to relax! Giving work over break is like a continuation of school at home. Not to mention, many people go away!”
Others, though, believe it to be beneficial. Senior Annemarie Levakis, a Musical Theatre major, exclaimed, “Personally, I feel that if the work has to do with im­proving your skills in what you’ll be doing for the rest of your life, then it’s definitely a great idea to be productive over break. I also feel that the work shouldn’t be assigned. It should be up to the student to choose whether or not they’d like to do work over break.”
Although being forced to complete assignments over break is helpful in terms of reviewing and exercising the information we are given, it can often spare students a lot of review time once break is over. It would be much easier for everyone involved to encourage students to review their notes over break rather than giving out projects and work. A lot of students of course would not take part in this, but those that are serious about doing well will take the opportunity and others with have to make up for it once they’re back at school. Dr. Barbara Fowles, Chairperson of the Media Arts Department, said, “I used to think break was a good time to give a slightly more com­plex and interesting assignment, but I have learned that if students do assignments at all, they do them when they get back, in a rush. So I try to make minimal assignments- just enough so stu­dents have something to discuss in class when they return.”
As college students, it’s our responsibility to make sure we know the material. When profes­sors enforce mandatory assign­ments over break, it becomes more of a drag and the students aren’t going to perform as well as usual. Dr. Fowles, by acknowl­edging this, allows her students space over break, and utilizes the next week back to reinforce the class material.
Personally, I don’t think we should be given work over break. As a designated time away from school, that should not involve assignments and projects. As I have written, the option for stu­dents to review their class notes and study over break is available to them if they would like. As long as professors honor this break and do not make it too difficult to follow along the week we come back, leaving the break free of scholarly priorities is only fair.

I am back from my two-week hiatus; I hope you missed me. So, I was out with my boyfriend and our mutual guy friend this past week. Just a casual night out for a few drinks. We stumbled upon the topic of differing dating habits. Our friend is the more typical college guy, the love’em and leave’em type. My boyfriend was never like that, even in high school.
My boyfriend and I were in the middle of telling him that it isn’t exactly moral to treat a girl like a princess until she lets you have sex with her and then never answer her texts/calls again. He took one look at my boyfriend and said, “ Why do you have a girlfriend? For the con­stant sex right?” I’m pretty sure my jaw dropped to the floor, looking reminiscent of an old acme cartoon. My boyfriend obviously replied appropriately seeing as I was sitting right next to him.
He said, of course, that is a plus although he would prefer it to be a little more frequent then it is currently happening (what guy wouldn’t). But more then that, him and I are best friends, we enjoy just hanging out with each other; he likes having me around as his constant companion. This time it was our friend’s jaw that dropped. He couldn’t fathom liking someone of the opposite sex that much and constantly want them around.
Is sex really all that 21+ guys care about these days? Is it really the only perk of having a girlfriend? A better question is why do girls con­tinue to fall for these charades?
If you know a guy’s track record and he starts to sweet talk you, why do you go along with it? It starts with the playful flirting, then the dinner dates, the after dinner drinks and then next thing you know you’re wak­ing up next to this guy; that is if he doesn’t give you the boot immediately after he’s done using you for sex. He may not even come right out and tell you to leave. He’ll probably say something like, “I have work really early,” or, “I have an early class, maybe it’s best if you don’t stay.” You’ll sympathize and just leave without even realizing what happened.
After all is said and done you will find yourself calling once or twice or shooting a text saying something along the lines of, “ I had a really good time the other night, what are your plans this weekend?” What do you get in response? Nothing. No text or call back. The worst part of it all, this was his master plan all along and he sees no issue with it. This guy will feel no remorse for doing this to you.
This was the argument we were having. My friend does this con­stantly and thinks it’s awesome that he gets away with it. His logic was, “If it works, why not continue to do it?” Thankfully my boyfriend did not agree with this reasoning and thinks it’s immoral to spend a ton of money taking a girl out and then not continue to date her. I knew I picked him for a reason!

Recently, Long Island University students received an email from Lynette Phillips, vice president for Legal Services, and George Baroudi, University’s chief information officer, warning them about illegal movie down­loads.
According to the Febru­ary 6 email, “The University has received several notices of illegal movie downloads from Warner Brothers Entertainment and HBO.” The email mentioned that students have downloaded mov­ies illegally and LIU Post officials are ensuring that students will not make this illegal move again. The email ended with “Be warned.”
The email informed LIU Post students of the consequenc­es of the illegal downloading of movies that has allegedly oc­curred on campus.
“The email was sent out partially because of President Obama’s push to crack down on online privacy and we were will­ing to assist with this,” Phillips said. “LIU Post was sent letters from companies like Time War­ner and HBO. We have gotten letters from the music industry a couple of years ago because of how students downloaded free music illegally.”
Baroudi did not respond to the Pioneer’s requests for com­ment about his contribution to the email sent to students.
There were mixed reactions from the student body in re­sponse to the email. Some stu­dents felt somewhat intimidated; others did not think anything of it. “Though the email seemed threatening, I still felt indifferent to it,” said Travis Doud, a fresh­man Biology major.
“I’ve never illegally down­loaded anything before and after seeing this email, it makes me never want to download anything illegally [in the future],” said Kathryn Brust, a freshman Busi­ness major.
The email, according to Phil­lips, was not meant to be harsh, “…But we wanted to get the point across in order to help the stu­dents and make them understand how serious this matter is.”
According to the email, the students who have downloaded movies illegally by using the LIU Post computer system have been identified after LIU officials researched the access dates and Internet Protocol, or IP, address­es. School authorities are now questioning the suspected stu­dents who have been identified.
“Individual students are liable for downloading things il­legally. Nowadays it is very easy for a company to find out if their items have been downloaded ille­gally and who downloaded them,” Phillips said.
“Now all they [the movie studios] have to do after finding this information out is reach us and ask about the students. As for the students who have yet to be found, they will be dealt with by Student Affairs. But even though the movie companies haven’t made any major charges yet, the students are still expected to face serious repercussions.”
The federal copyright law states that punishments for ille­gally downloading movies as well as other forms of entertainment include fines of up to $30,000.
The email also stated, “Repeated thefts could result in imprisonment up to five (5) years and fines of $250,000 per offense.” When asked, Phillips, however, was unsure of what punishments the University would give as well as who will of­ficially conduct the punishments.
The music industry has been affected severely by illegal downloading as well. As Phillips and Baroudi informed students in their email, “Ripping music is not a victimless crime—it is theft of royalties from writers and musi­cians, theft of wages from record­ing studio and stage crews and theft of operating monies from companies that subsidize the music industry.”
According to the August 2012 article, “How Hollywood Is Encouraging Online Piracy,” in Scientific American written by David Progue, “Traffic to illegal download sites has more than sextupled since 2009.”
Though this article claims that rates of downloading music and movies illegally have in­crease significantly since 2009, LIU Post students interviewed have said that it is harder to download forms of entertain­ment today due to the entertain­ment industry’s crackdown to stop this illegal action.
“I personally feel that four years ago downloading was much easier. Now it’s much more dif­ficult but now there are forums where you can obtain other sites and info to download,” said P.J, a freshman Business major, who asked that his name not be used to avoid potential trouble with the University.
Even though it is a very hard process, people continue to be able to download things illegally. According to the recent email, LIU Post is now cooperating with Warner Brothers Entertainment and HBO to stop students from illegally downloading on the LIU campus computer system.

This semester, LIU Post’s Academic Career and Planning office is offering Effective Study Strategy Workshops for students who are having difficulty studying and keeping their grades up.
The workshops, which are designed to assist students on the academic and career front, are of­fered several times throughout the semester. The Time Management and Test-Taking workshops have been held twice this term. Other workshops include writing an effective cover letter and resume, exploring careers and choosing a major, going on job interviews and how to effectively search for a job.
The most recent workshop, Effective Study Strategies, was held during common hour in Hu­manities on February 26, with an attendance of about 25 students.
Students received different studying tips during the interac­tive workshop. The hosts, Assistant Director of the Learning Support Center, Gregory Schimmel, Aca­demic Advisor, Heather Delano and Academic Advisor, Daniel Lauterman asked students why they felt they were having trouble. They then recommended different solutions for the problems. For ex­ample, students who have trouble with time management should plan in advance in order to allot the appropriate amount of time to complete their work.
Schimmel enjoys the chance to participate in the work­shops. “It’s a great opportunity to work with the counselors who do such a great job presenting ideas and suggestions to stu­dents,” he said. He added that the workshop is a helpful tool to also help promote the tutoring services on campus.
“I enjoy the team approach in planning these workshops where we can discuss and de­velop new and creative ideas to present important information to students to engage them and help them to self-assess their own strengths and weakness and find what techniques work best for them,” said Delano, who co-facil­itates the Effective Study Strate­gies and Test Taking Strategies Workshop.
Throughout the hour-long presentation, they discussed all of the resources on campus that students can use for help with studying such as Peer Tutoring, the Program for Academic Suc­cess and the Student Health and Counseling Center.
Schimmel is primarily re­sponsible for two areas within the Learning Support Center: PAS, an alternative admissions program, and the Peer Tutoring Program. He is the academic advisor for students in the PAS program.
PAS is a program to assist freshmen who do not qualify for Post’s admission requirements, but demonstrate potential for academic success. The one-year academic program helps students matriculate without restrictions by providing a reduced course load, smaller class size, support services and continuous evalua­tion during freshman year.
The Peer Tutoring Program staff, whom is made up of care­fully selected and trained tutors, who are also LIU Post students, assists undergraduate students with specific subjects, assign­ments or projects.
Each tutor demonstrates exceptional knowledge and skills in a particular subject area. In ad­dition, they can assist with study skills, note-taking tips, time man­agement techniques and test-tak­ing strategies. Peer tutors provide one-to-one assistance as well as small group support. Schimmel selects and trains the tutors while overseeing the day-to-day tutor­ing sessions.
During the workshop, Schimmel explained that there is a Disability Support Service in the Learning Support Center. DSS coordinates accommodations for students who have documented learning disabilities, ensuring equal access to programs and ser­vices and creating an accessible supportive environment.
“Often medical and/or psychological issues can have a negative impact on how a stu­dent performs in class,” said Schimmel. “Should students have a need, it’s important to take advantage of the resources that are available,” he added.
The Student Health and Counseling Center, located in Life Science Building in room 115, of­fers medical, counseling, psychiat­ric and nutritional services as well as drug and alcohol counseling. This service is free and confiden­tial for enrolled LIU Post students.
The biggest challenge stu­dents face, according to Delano is time. “I think many students today are pulled in so many different di­rections and face the challenge of trying to do it all and at the same time get straight A’s sometimes causing high levels of stress and anxiety,” she explained.
Delano says that poor study­ing habits could be a result of a student carrying a full-time credit course load, working part time, being a member of a club or sport and attempting to maintain a cer­tain grade point average to main­tain an academic scholarship.
Improving academics, learn­ing new material and retaining information requires a lot of time, effort and diligence. However, Delano believes it is worth the work: “We hope that these work­shops will provide students with tools for learning and help them become more successful during their college career,” she added.
Delano encourages students to take advantage of all the re­sources on campus such as the tu­toring services, the Writing Center and Student Health and Counsel­ing. “Sometimes a little direction can go a long way. Don’t give up and give yourself enough time to prepare,” said Delano.
Lauterman mentioned that technology is very prevalent in students’ lives. “As technology ad­vances, students need to be made aware of the educational benefits that are out there to help them succeed in their pursuits of a degree. The different educational iPad applications that we provided students during our workshop are just one way to provide them with information,” said Lauterman.
He recommends that students download apps such as Pages, CNN, Black­board, Audionote and Dictionary.
Sophomore Speech Pathology major, Melissa Saldiveri, attended the workshop because she is on academic probation. While on academic probation, it is a requirement to attend all of the study workshops. “I found the different techniques for note taking really helpful and it did give me the push I needed to be more focused on studying,” said Saldiveri.
Sophomore Health Care Administration major Gerard Presta attended the workshop because his advisor said it was a good idea due to his weaknesses in taking notes and studying. “I found it very helpful, I learned different tech­niques of studying and taking notes that I never heard of,” said Presta.
Making more time for studying and re-copying notes, according to Presta, were the most valuable lessons he learned from the workshop. He would rec­ommend this workshop to other students. However, he said that he “felt like they could have added more information on better note taking.”
Dimitra Mpounas, a student in the masters program in Political Science, who graduated from LIU Post in May 2012 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science and Minor in Criminal Justice, has been a tutor at the Learning Sup­port Center for the past four years. Mpounas spoke at the workshop about tips for successful studying.
“One major tip that I would recommend to students is to start studying early for exams, writing papers by budgeting their time. Most importantly, if you don’t understand the material get help as soon as possible,” said Mpounas.
“Every department has its own tutors. This service is free. There are a variety of resources to help accommodate everyone’s needs,” she added.
Students may learn more about the dates and times of the workshops in the Academic and Career Planning office, located in Kumble Hall, or online at http://www.liu.edu/CWPost/StudentLife/Services/Counseling/Events.

As universities embrace the digital age and offer a multitude of online courses, LIU Post only offers three online programs. Two of the credited courses are offered at the graduate level and one is offered for undergraduate students.
Those programs consist of Archives and Record Management and Mobile GIS Application, which are only available to graduate students, and Health Information Management, which is only available for undergrads. As of now, there is no new information as to whether the University will offer more online programs.
When asked about the success of online courses, Dr. Liz Ciabocchi, associate vice president for Instructional Technology and Faculty Develop­ment at LIU Online said, “When done properly, on­line classes can be very effective [educationally].”
According to Ciabocchi, the online courses offered by Post are not tied to specific courses; they are just general courses to fill any gaps. Ciaboc­chi does feel that online courses are not meant for everyone. “[Taking an online course] is a learned habit in itself, just like studying,” said Ciabocchi.
David Shimkin, English professor at LIU Post, agrees that online courses are beneficial in that they are flexible when it comes down to timing. However, Shimkin also believes that online courses take away certain qualities a classroom has versus a laptop.
Shimkin feels that online courses do not compare to an actual teacher standing in front of a student teaching and explaining a topic in every de­tail, answering every question. “Online classes are beneficial because they allow for flexibility when other schedules, such as an in a predetermined classroom course, do not.”
The student body at Post is very diverse in that there are students straight from high school, adults returning to school and transfer students who come to Post after completing a certain amount of credits from another school.
Transfer students need to have a required amount of credits before entering their accurate year at Post. Amanda Celentano, a junior Radiologic Technology major, transferred from Nassau Com­munity College this past year. While Post accepted 53 of her credits, Celentano had to take the rest of the credits she needed online. Celentano also had to take a couple of history courses at SUNY Farmingdale because they were not offered online at Post.
During her fall semester, Celentano took Medical Terminology, an online course, which was offered through Post. This class was a major requirement and a prerequisite, which, according to Celentano, would have set her back if she had traditionally taken the course.
The online courses Celentano took at Farmingdale last summer cost an average of $800 per class. The cost of a certificate in Health Infor­mation Management, which is a 30-credit online program, is $22,000.
The advanced certificate in Mobile GIS Appli­cation costs approximately $2,100 per course with a $360 term fee. The certificate is 12-credit program.
“I would much rather take a classroom course because I feel more like a student,” said Celentano. “I like the feeling of going to school, rather than being on my laptop two hours a day. In my opinion, I believe that online courses require a lot more writ­ing work, which is not my favorite thing to do.”
Celentano believes that students taking online classes must discipline themselves be­cause they are forced to have the responsibility of assignments and due dates. They become the teacher, Celentano added.
For more information on online courses, con­tact the Office of Academic and Career Counsel­ing at (516) 299-2900.

The Long Island Room of Winnick was full of energy and fun on March 2. From 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. the Student Caribbean Asso­ciation (SCA) along with the Student Dance Association (SDA) and TWIce as Nice hosted a fundraiser event called Keep Your Hand Above the Line.
Admission prices were $10 for partici­pants and $5 for spectators. The competi­tion required participants to keep their hand above a line for the duration of five hours or for however long they could last. Everyone who entered was motivated, knowing that there was a $300 Visa gift card waiting to be won.
The proceeds from the competition are going to the Fiver Children’s Foundation. According to Tatiana Marshall, SCAs Vice President, “One of our members was a part of the foundation in her youth and it was dear to her heart. The Fiver Foundation is about giving back to the community and that is what we aim to do.”
Fiver Children’s Foundation is a youth development organization that assists inner-city children from ages eight to 18. The foundation funds year-round mentoring and counseling programs and a residential sum­mer camp.
During the five hours of fun, DJ Sparkx, one of the campuses favorite DJs, provided music for all to enjoy. Not only did he supply music he joined in the fun with a game called “Sparkx says.” Copying the classic Simon Says game, DJ Sparkx had the participants jump­ing, spinning in circles, switching places, and dancing to songs like Cha Cha Slide with his special mixes.
In addition to DJ Sparkx’s music games, general members of the co-sponsoring clubs took part in trying to get students off the wall. The general members of SCA, SDA and TWIce as Nice threw tennis balls for the contestants to catch, passed out waters and snack, and danced all around them. Their joint effort was still not enough to get the participants to quit. At the three hour mark, Dylin Lewis, a freshman with an undeclared major, said, “my motivation for staying in the game is the money; nothing but the money.”
As time went by the competition got stronger. There were timed eating contests which quickly eliminated people. Within 30 seconds students had to chew and swallow brownies, chicken fajitas, hot wings, and fruits. Some could handle the pressure while others fell short and were removed from the game.
Between the eating contests SCA Presi­dent Rockshana Desances asked several trivia questions including campus knowledge and other miscellaneous topics. These questions confused contestants, especially those about sports. Surprisingly, the names of the campus’ residence halls were questionable to some residents!
Four hours had passed and it was down to Irving Derlin Engineer Major at City Col­lege (CCNY) and Post’s own Sophomore Dance major Freyani Patrice. The two went head to head with trivia and menial chal­lenges such as keeping their legs up and only having one hand on the wall. Derlin said, “I didn’t even know about the competition. I just came to visit a friend and I’m just hoping to be the last.” Unfortunately for Irving Derlin, Freyani Patrice proved herself as the winner of the competition.
Freyani Patrice lasted in the competition for four hours and forty minutes and won the grand prize $300 Visa gift card. She was so thankful and said, “I am a commuter so that is some helpful gas money; the rest will go toward my school expenses.”

Eighty tickets were dis­pensed for illegally parking in handicap spots on campus last semester. LIU Post has strict rules and regulations regarding this kind of violation.
On September 24, 2012, Dr. Paul Forestell, LIU Post provost, and Paul Rapess, the director of Public Safety, issued an email to the campus community that stated, “The provision of des­ignated parking spaces at Long Island University for individu­als with disabilities is not just a civic responsibility, but a legal requirement.”
According to the Rehabilita­tion Act of 1973, individuals with disabilities have rights to barrier free access. Additionally, LIU must provide reasonable altera­tions and accommodations for those with disabilities. According to the school website, there are currently about 129 handicap parking spots.
Parking in a handicap space without the appropriate docu­mentation is against the law. All students must register their vehicle with Public Safety. Ac­cording to Public Safety, register­ing with the department allows it to keep track of where additional handicap spaces could be needed.
This could also help elimi­nate illegal usage of borrowed handicap permits, which is when individuals use someone else’s handicap tag. Students who are not registered to park in handicap areas will have the illegal handi­cap tags removed and it will be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles, which will then give additional monetary fines. The campus also reserves the right to tow an illegally parked vehicle.
“The Parking fine [on cam­pus] is $60 and the towing fee is $120, but a storage fee can be charged if the car is left over­night,” said Rapess. “Those fees are between the towing company and the individual owner of the vehicle,” he added.
“I think parking illegally in handicap [spots] is wrong, worse than parking illegally anywhere else on campus. There should be harsh penalties,” said junior Public Relations major, Devan Farrell.
Senior Music Education major, Alessandra Holmes, ex­pressed her thoughts on the issue and explained what she would do if she witnessed someone abus­ing the parking space. “It’s just terrible. Especially when I see someone without a sticker on the car. I think it’s ridiculous. It’s like ‘what are you doing?’ If I were to see it, I probably would say, ‘Why are you parking in an illegal spot that you know your not supposed to be parking in?’ Think of all the others who really need that spot and you don’t. It’s not going to kill you if you have to walk a little bit longer.”
Students who are temporar­ily disabled can apply for a tem­porary parking permit through Student Health and Services, located in Pell Hall. This pass is not for handicap spots, but does allow you to park in faculty/staff parking areas, which are closer to the academic buildings.
You can learn more about handicap parking rules by visit­ing Public Safety’s link on the LIU website. If you see or know of someone who is abusing the use of handicap parking, you are encouraged to report it at 516-299-2214.

Dr. Thomas Demaria, director of the Psychological Services Center, which is the training facility for students in the psychol­ogy doctoral program at LIU Post, gave a speech at the Legislature Capitol building in Connecticut to help those affected by the Sandy Hook shooting.
He was accompanied by students Nicole Nadell and Michele Conti, both from the LIU Post Clinical Psychology doctoral program, on February 22, 2013.
Demaria was asked to speak at the San­dy Hook Advisory Commission by Connect­icut Governor Dannel P. Malloy. The Sandy Hook Advisory Commission is a group of 15 people, including principals, professors, public safety personnel and psychologists, who were appointed by Governor Malloy to make recommendations about public safety, school safety, mental health and gun control for the state of Connecticut.
The goal of the commission is to look at the state policies and procedures for help­ing children deal with traumatic events so the state, and perhaps the rest of the country, can learn from Sandy Hook Elementary where 20 children and six school staff members died on December 14, 2013.
Malloy wanted influential people from out­side of the area because, according to Demaria, the staff in the Sandy Hook school district was feeling emotionally burdened with the tragedy.
A psychological trauma is a stressor that is experienced when people feel their life is threatened. When a person is traumatized, they have frequent flashbacks of the memory because their mind is still trying to process it.
Demaria, who has been a New York State-licensed psychologist for 26 years with experience in schools after tragedies, was asked to speak about psychological trauma. The goal was to find an efficient way to help the children cope with their trauma. Demaria has over 20 years of hospital behavioral leadership experience. In addition, he has won numerous awards for his practice and founded LIU Post’s trauma response team when he came to Post four years ago.
One of Demaria’s topics at the commis­sion discussed how memorials in remem­brance for the children who died should be used to help those affected grieve. “Memorials should be done for children with a sensitivity that should only remind children of what they want to remember. Not all children should have to participate. Sometimes people make mistakes by putting memorials where students can see them all the time and care has to be taken so that children who don’t want to see it, don’t have to see it all the time,” he said.
The challenge with helping children deal with their trauma is that not every child is going to grieve the same way. Demaria, who visited Sandy Hook Elemen­tary in the days after the shooting, saw children running out of the school for recess, many wearing New York Giants football jerseys in remembrance of one of their classmates who was a Giants fan.
Some students show grief externally, while others internalize it, according to Demaria. In order to see how the child is feeling, Demaria encouraged people to observe a child’s artwork, play and writing.
Demaria added that one of the components of helping the children grieve is having everyone in the school prepared to talk to them if approached, whether they are a cafeteria worker, teacher or a janitor.
“Schools are an ideal place for people to learn how to grieve because you have a chance to talk to parents, teachers and staff about the rules for grieving,” Demaria said. “And a lot of times people have a lot of ambivalence or fear about talking to kids about grief but grief is a natural emotion, and schools can treat it like a natural emo­tion just like anger, fear or happiness. Then students will learn how to talk about it and move past it,” he added.
However, adults must be careful about how they explain something to a child be­cause they might unintentionally confuse them more. “Some parents or teachers tell a child that their grandma is sleeping forever when their grandmother died. According to your spiritual belief, your grandma might be in heaven but she is no longer around. Sometimes kids will come to me and say ‘my grandma is asleep forever.’ And I say no, she died,” Demaria said,
“Schools don’t want to use the word died because kids get traumatized but that’s what it is. When someone dies, you tell kids everything stops that makes you alive—you do not breathe, you do not think. Because children will think for example that grand­ma’s trapped in the ground and kids will get frightened by it. We think that’s silly, but kids are very literal,” he adds.
Demaria also said that schools must pay attention to how they recognize anniversa­ries. Some students will react well to sitting in an auditorium talking about it, while other students might be bothered by that. He said that schools should try to be sensitive to the individual wishes of each child.
The biggest obstacle for a psychologist, according to Demaria, is recognizing that “there’s a limit to what you can do [to help].” He added that it is also important to know how much a child can handle so that he or she does not become a victim.
Demaria was in East Moriches, N.Y. after Flight 800 crashed in 1996. He was asked to work alongside the disaster morticians. “I said I’ll work with the disaster morticians as they come out of there but I won’t go in there. I don’t think that’s the place I want to be. And one person said ‘I’ll handle it,’ so they walked in, and 20 minutes later they walked out. They looked sick and they had to be brought off the scene because they weren’t used to seeing that,” said Demaria.
Taking a break, enjoying the weekend and spending time with family are ways that De­maria copes with witnessing so many tragedies.
Demaria said that the staff and students who went back to Sandy Hook Elementary School after the murders are true heroes. “A hero is someone who goes someplace where no one wants to be. Imagine how hard it was for these teachers to go back to that school district and work with those kids. They’re he­roes. Look at these families that have to trust the school enough that they can send their kids back to school knowing that this hap­pened in this school district. They are heroes.”
