On Friday, Nov. 5, no. 5-ranked field hockey rolled over no. 6-ranked Stonehill College in the NE-10 Conference semifinals, 3-0, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
Sophomore forward/midfielder, Emily Miller, had a day to remember. She had a hand in each score for the Pioneers and earned five points in the process. The victory puts the team in its third conference championship bout in the last four seasons.
All the scoring for the match came in a four-minute span in the second half, and that was enough. Miller notched the first goal in the 53rd minute, beating two defenders and the goalie for the opening tally. A few minutes later, Miller was back again; this time she was part of an odd-man rush that resulted in another goal. Sophomore forward/midfielder, Molly Cunha, assisted Miller on the mark, helping the Pioneers move one step closer to victory.
Less than a minute after the second goal, the Pioneers added another goal. Sophomore forward/midfielder, Tarryn Morris, received a pass from Miller and sent her shot past the keeper to triple the Pioneer lead.
Senior goalkeeper, Ericka Parks, earned another shutout victory, stopping all three shots that came her way. During the team’s current six-game winning streak, it has yet to allow more than one goal in a game and has allowed a grand total of two over that stretch.
The Pioneers returned to action on Sunday, Nov. 6, in the NE-10 Conference Championship game against Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. Earlier in the season, the Pioneers dealt Saint Anselm a 2-1 loss thanks to goals from junior defender, Grace Ilias, and junior forward, Kaycee Zelkovsky.
The no. 3 Hawks from Saint Anselm must have felt like it was déjà vu, as the great Yogi Berra once said, as the Pioneers toppled them 2-1 again and claimed the NE-10 Conference title.
Miller carried over her terrific performance from two days earlier and provided the fireworks in overtime when she fired a shot into the cage for the walk-off, game-winning, conference-claiming goal. Assisting on the tally was sophomore midfielder/defender, Julie Gysels. Miller was named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player for her stellar two-game performance.
Miller’s heroics almost were not necessary though. After establishing a one-goal lead in the first half thanks to senior midfielder, Steph Mocerino, the Pioneers held that advantage until the final seconds of regulation when Rose Mooney scored the crushing equalizer. The Pioneers, not rattled, settled down after momentum was snatched away from them and put the winning piece to the puzzle in the back of net just two minutes into the overtime session.
For their role in the Pioneers run to Ne-10 champions, Ilias and Parks were named, along with Miller, to the conference All-Tournament Team.
The Pioneers received a bye in the upcoming NCAA Division II Tournament and will play the winner of the Saint Anselm College and Stonehill College matchup in Easton, Mass.
Head Coach Raenee Savin was excited about making the tournament and also about the opportunity the Pioneers have at a ring. “I’m confident in the work we put in and the focus we have. We continue to take it one day at a time and focus on winning the NCAA semi-final, but this team has a lot of NCAA experience, so it feels pretty good right now,” she said.
The Pioneers’ semi-final game is set for Nov. 18.

After dominating Pace University in its regular-season home finale and climbing to its highest national ranking in program history, the no. 10-ranked football team solidified its place as one of the best teams in Division II with a 64-7 throttling of Merrimack College on Saturday, Nov. 5, in North Andover, Mass. The win improves the Pioneers to a perfect 10-0 record, a first since the 2002 season.
Coming back from a knee injury, senior Jeff Kidd led the Pioneers at quarterback, completing 21-of-30 passes for 266 yards and two touchdowns. He was eventually relieved by redshirt sophomore quarterback, Michael Campbell, who wasn’t too shabby himself, throwing for 74 yards on only six attempts and two scores.
The Pioneer’s offense got going early and often. In the first quarter, separate Pioneer drives were capped off by senior halfback, David White, who ran in from 15 yards out and redshirt junior receiver, Kyle Ward, who scored on a 12 yard pass from Kidd.
In the second quarter, redshirt sophomore running back, the second of the two-headed backfield monster, found the endzone from three yards out to make it 21-0 in favor of the Green and Gold. A few possessions later, the Pioneers went up four touchdowns on connection from Kidd to redshirt senior pass catcher, Shane Hubbard. At the halftime horn, the Pioneers led 31-0.
The Pioneers apparently were not satisfied with a 31 point advantage and in the second half, they changed that in just two plays. Redshirt sophomore defensive back, Kasim Thomas, read the eyes of the opposing quarterback, picked off the pass and took it back 18 yards for a pick-six.
Campbell subbed in under center for a majority of the second half and threw touchdown passes to redshirt junior receiver, Tyler Collins, and redshirt sophomore receiver, Michael Hartgrove. The final Pioneer points came via freshman tailback, Tim Marinan, who scampered 18 yards for six, making it 64-0 at that point in the fourth quarter. A Merrimack touchdown with a minute left spoiled the Pioneer shutout, but nonetheless, the Pioneers dominated seemingly every facet of the game.
The Pioneer’s rushing attack totaled 194 yards from nine contributors. In the receiving department, Hubbard went for six catches, 84 yards and a touchdown while Higgins also had six catches for 56 yards.
On the defensive side of the ball, the Pioneers had four interceptions on the day, two of which went to freshman defensive back Joshua Flowers. Redshirt freshman linebacker, Conor Haverty, had four tackles and a forced fumble in the victory as well.
The Pioneers, led by Head Coach Bryan Collins, will play host to No. 15 ranked Assumption College in the NE- 10 Conference Championship on Saturday, Nov. 12. In their matchup earlier this season, the Pioneers came out victorious 19-18 in large part thanks to a running game that went for 185 yards and a defense that forced three turnovers. Kickoff from Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium is set for noon. The game can also be seen on ESPN3.

Coming off a thrilling 1-0 victory over NYIT, men’s soccer took any drama out of its match against St. Thomas Aquinas College on Thursday, Nov. 3. The team netted five first half goals, eight altogether, in its East Coast Conference semifinal on home ground.
In the first eighteen minutes and change, the Pioneers scored four goals. The opening goal came just four minutes into the contest from senior forward, Jason Lampkin. Ten minutes later freshman forward, Michael Sutton, doubled the Pioneer advantage off a precision pass from sophomore midfielder, Charlie Ledula.
Ledula wasn’t finished there either; he put the finishing touches on the next set of goals coming 70 seconds apart from each other to put the Pioneers up 4-0.
At the half, the Pioneers led 5-0 thanks to the first of two goals on the day from freshman forward, Gianluca Santacruz. In the second half, the host continued its relentless attack, adding three goals. After Santacruz’s second tally, individual marks from senior forward Sean Collins and Alex Ostby rounded out the scoring. The Pioneers outshot St. Thomas by a 22-9 margin, leading to the lopsided scoreboard.
Because it ousted St. Thomas, LIU advanced to the ECC Championship on Saturday, Nov. 5, against Molloy College. Once again, the Pioneers came out victorious, winning 3-0 and claiming the ECC crown for the second straight year with a historic regular season record, 17-0-1.
Like its match against St. Thomas, the team got going early and got on the board with a goal in the ninth minute thanks to a lucky bounce off a Molloy defender and into the goal. The Pioneers offense scraped together the initial tally and held Molloy off the board for the first 45 minutes.
The defense was effective in limiting the opposition to only one shot on goal in the first half, and an additional one in the second half.
The middle of the three tallies came via Lampkin, who scored his second in as many games, and the final goal came courtesy of sophomore back, Nicolai Kjaer Andersen, off a pass from junior midfielder, Harry Pearse.
“We have to keep looking at each game as it comes. It’s knock-out soccer, and we need to play every game like it’s our last,” said senior forward, Sean Collins. “Our season is do or die every game now but it’s very important to focus on one game at a time.”
The Pioneers won the East Coast conference and earned a bye in the NCAA Division II Championship Tournament. The team will play the winner of the matchup between Franklin Pierce University and Merrimack College on Saturday, Nov. 12, at 1 p.m. at the Pioneer Soccer Park.

It’s often the smallest details that matter the most in the life of students. This has proved to be true with a change in Humanities at the beginning of the fall semester.
Besides several other additions and changes made to Humanities over the summer break (new dance studios, removal of DVD players from classrooms, new walkways in front), the change that many students have found most notable was the closing of Aramark’s café in the hallway of the first floor. The cafe was the source of snacks, water and coffee for staff, faculty and students throughout the day. Long lines often waited outside the café in between classes during the week.
The café allowed students to get a quick snack for breakfast or lunch before and in-between classes so they wouldn’t be late. The convenient location eliminated the task of having to rush back and forth between Hillwood Commons and Humanities to get food before class every day, especially during inclement weather.
The decision to close the café was not an easy one, according to Edward Taraskewich, Aramark’s resident district manager. “Our team carefully analyzed the Humanities Café sales and expenses over the last several months and reviewed that data along with LIU administrators,” he said. “Ultimately, declining sales and increasing costs deemed the closure necessary.”
Although he was aware of the inconvenience it may cause for staff and students, Taraskewich did not lose optimism. “The close proximity to both the Bleeker Street Café and Hillwood Commons allows students, faculty and staff in the area to access a greater variety of foods and beverages, which can all be taken on the go to other locations.”
Over the years, students even became friendly with the staff in the café. As the Pioneer reported in 2012, when longtime Humanities Café cashier Joan Lavin retired, students expressed regret. [See Pioneer story http:// liupostpioneer.com/?s=Humanities+cafe ] While some students have not paid much attention to the closing of the Humanities café, others were aware of its departure and said that it has affected their daily school routine. Sophomore health/physical education major Andre Bennett said the shop’s closing initially came as a shock to him. “I was surprised at first. But now, ever since it closed down, I have to walk all the way to Hillwood Commons to get snacks before class,” he said.
Students are not the only ones affected. Barbara Fowles, chairperson of the department of communications and film, and longtime professor, said that the closing of the cafe makes life a bit tougher for students on campus. “In my opinion, closing the little café in Hillwood is another small cut into the quality of life
on campus, especially for students. I’ve seen students that had to run through the rain, and soon they will be running through the snow, to get something to eat between classes.”
Students and staff alike will need to plan their daily routines differently due to the change.

On Oct. 17, sophomore art therapy major Jessica Faiella was involved in a car accident with another student on campus. The accident took place near the Tilles Center around 10 a.m. Public Safety was called to the scene.
Faiella hit her head during the collision, which also totaled her car. She was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, where she mentioned a bump on her neck that she had noticed prior to the car accident.
Upon further testing, the doctors discovered Faiella has stage two Hodgkins Lymphoma. Faiella took a medical leave from school this semester to begin intense chemotherapy.
Maddison Cassese, a close friend of Faiella’s, set up a GoFundMe page to help Faiella’s family raise money for her medical expenses, and to make Faiella a wig made of her own hair. Donations can be made at:

Editor’s Note: 
A Pioneer reporter visited the office of Public Safety to review the campus crime log several times last week. Although a federal law called the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act requires all campus crimes and incidents to be reported and available for public inspection within two business days, there was no record of Faiella’s Oct. 17 car accident in the crime log. A Public Safety representative said if an incident report was filed, they will be adding it to the Crime Blotter, but declined further comment on the matter.

Well into the eleventh week of the semester, campus sidewalk renovations that began in August are still underway, though for two weeks have seemed to come to a pause. The ongoing construction poses as a potential danger to students who may not be watching where they are going.
A majority of the reconstruction outside of Humanities Hall was completed the week before classes started. Yet some areas seemed to have been rushed, according to several students and professors who walk these paths.
The bricks have become loose already and not completely fitted into place, leaving holes and cracks wide enough for a student to misstep and be injured.
“I don’t know why they are still working with students on campus,” said Rachel Schwartz, a junior psychology major.
New construction on the sidewalks and paths around Hillwood and Pell Hall dominates the campus today, tarnishing the aesthetic of the campus grounds. Though it seems that before the Fall Open House for prospective students this past weekend, the issues with the site outside of Hillwood Commons were corrected.
“Work is progressing as expected, and we look forward to completing our current projects while the weather remains optimal for construction,” William Kirker, director of Facilities Services, shared on the timeliness of the project. With the shifting weather forecasts, the completion can only be roughly anticipated.
The construction is part of a regular program of repairs designed to maintain the appearance, safety and day-to-day operation of the campus. The safety precautions for students include caution tape and overturned safety cones and barrels in areas where construction is active. Loose bricks and small gaps in the walkways outside Humanities were filled with compacting minerals—sand or stones, it is unclear—in order to secure the path for passersby and to make it presentable.
According to Kirker, plans are in place to renovate additional walkways this year, and the labor will be from a number of local firms based on a competitive bidding process. “We are pleased to continue enhancing the campus experience for our students and the entire LIU Post community,” he said.

English Department Chairperson and Professor Dr. John Lutz brings an honest perspective to his courses through his teaching philosophy and activities. Dr. Lutz is a Long Island native who also happens to be a Post alumnus. He earned his B.A. and M.A. in English at Post and went on to receive his PhD in Comparative English at Stony Brook University. As chairperson of the English department, Dr. Lutz helps develop the curriculum, and is a guiding hand to students.
Dr. Lutz and the English department are offering many new courses for students this semester. He began teaching a course on democracy and Athens. The course gives students a chance to react to the fifth century Athens by assigning students roles of individuals who lived during the time, and have them form an assembly. This assembly will then tackle issues from that time period through engagement and acting; “role emerging,” is the term Lutz uses to describe the course. It offers a combination of history and philosophy.
In teaching this course, Lutz encourages students to apply human nature and empathy to themselves and those around them. He desires them to be able to put themselves in other people’s shoes and adopt other perspectives. The course is currently open to Honors College students looking for electives. Lutz hopes if and when the class is successful to open it to all students.
Lutz’s classroom style is different from other professors, according to himself. He brings a sense of comfort to his classroom setting. He is very eager about the fact he does not teach his courses in the traditional setting of rows. He alters the room to be set up in a circle to unite students and encourage interaction, describing the setting as less authoritative and more communal. This allows for meaning and a personal connection to the subject.
This setting breaks students off the barriers and shines light on their potential to grow. In addition to this teaching philosophy, Lutz is big on discussion-based lectures. “I am not fond of a lot of lecture. I want students to feel encouraged to start conversation and I can just facilitate when needed,” he said.
Besides teaching the course on democracy and Athens, Dr. Lutz teaches one of the first-year seminars to new students. The first year seminar took on the series “Breaking Bad” and connecting it to characters in literature that “break bad.”
It takes on ethics and literature as the class is currently discussing Shakespeare’s play “Macbeth.” Lutz is the co-director of Post 101, which is the required orientation class for freshmen. In teaching these courses, Lutz is highly satisfied when students are involved and willing to ask questions.
In addition to the new courses on campus, Lutz is working on new projects. He is involved with the learning communities, which link three-credit courses and disciplines together. Dr. Lutz is always looking to improve the core curriculum to help students connect to their personal degrees.

Life. It always has something, just around the corner, ready to smack you in the face. A very unexpected and random smack in the face, I must add. You’ll be having a great time, starting the semester excellently and generally feeling pretty good. Then BANG! Life goes, “oh no you don’t!” And it doesn’t just hit you with one curveball; it will throw dozens at a time.
Life threw me a few Mike Tyson punches during the last couple of weeks. It was just as the ECC playoffs were about to start and during midterms week. As a student-athlete, simultaneous playoffs and midterms are among the things you just have to be able to deal with. On the other hand, what wasn’t in the job description and doesn’t spring to mind when you sign the dotted line to serve the GREENlands of Pioneer country, is all the other things that arose during that busy time.
For me, last week, I had to say hello and then goodbye to my fantastic father and unbelievably brilliant uncle. I then had the complete realization, on the men’s soccer senior day, that my best friends, who I have lived everyday with for the last three years, but who are a year ahead of me, are graduating. And as each one of them ran through the tunnel onto the field after their names were recognized, I couldn’t help but feel the imminence of them all leaving me. “There’s one best friend gone, oh there’s another, and another…” This carried on for what felt like an eternity.
On top of these impeccably timed disasters, by Life of course, I had bad news from home, and the old madness of Love was, once again, giving me feelings like “pulsations of an artery,” as Plato once described. This was completely and emotionally overwhelming, daunting. It felt like I had five or six huge things to deal with all at once! “What the bloody hell do I do?” I asked myself.
A wise man once told me, “Deal with the things you CAN control. And with the things you cannot control, don’t sweat them; you obviously cannot do anything about them.” These were the wise and guru-esque words of my father: a person who always comes to my rescue.
If we all look at what he said, it makes so much sense, right? I cannot control problems at home in England, I can’t control or stop my friends from graduating and moving on with the next stage in their lives, and why should I look at my father and uncle visiting in a negative manner, just because they had to leave? I need to take the positives, and treasure the memories I had with them in the short time that they were here.
However, I can control how I perform in practice and in soccer games; that’s in my hands, how I focus, how I prepare. I can also control the outcome of my midterms and academics. I need to make sure I study adequately, and although we all sometimes feel that we have so much on our plate, if we eliminate the things that we can’t control, then maybe the things that are dependent on US to deal with, won’t seem so daunting after all.
The elimination of the uncontrolled, and LIFE-like problems which each one of us experiences, could provide us all with a lot more clarity. It will also allow us to differentiate, later on in our lives, what is important to stress over and maybe what we don’t have to kill ourselves with.
Next time you feel that ever so frightening and formidable scare of everything hitting you at once, try to think, what can I control? And what is out of my hands? If you have to write this down, do it. I truly believe it will help all of us to calm down, and think logically about our next course of action, rather than allowing it to affect everything we do on a day-to-day basis.

Reflection, critical thinking and the ability to plan ahead are viewed as positive qualities. Critical thinking is supposed to keep us from getting manipulated, resist political propaganda and challenge society’s norms and structures. Planning ahead is supposed to help us make rational decisions and keep us out of future crises in all areas of life.
School is supposed to train us in these areas and our society’s economic system rewards people who have long-term plans and can resist impulsive decisions. But continuous reviewing and questioning of the current situation might be counterproductive.
First, the energy and time spent on analyzing the situation will affect your focus and efficacy.
Second, with reflection, there is a good chance that more opportunities will surface, which can complicate the situation. It has been shown by psychologist Barry Schwartz that more options decrease the satisfaction of a choice after a certain level. That is, too many choices will leave you wondering what making other choices would result in, which will make you view your own choice negatively.
The risk, if you also are a bit perfectionistic, is that you will get stuck with either not making any decisions at all or constantly over-planning, switching tracks with strong belief that the grass is greener on the other side. Either way, the constant reflection will have an inhibitory effect.
It is no wonder that the two processes are usually separated in companies. One unit takes care of strategy and planning, and another unit takes care of the daily work of operations. And even though a company’s strategy and operations have to interact, for a human, the lack of interaction is probably not the problem.
Princeton University professor Daniel Kahneman, who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics, refers to the “experience self” and “reflection self” when explaining that there are two different parts of our minds. These parts can come in conflict and, according to Kahnman, we have to decide whether to maximize the present experience or the future. The things that make us enjoy the present might not be the things that make us satisfied with life when reflecting.
There is no question that mixing up and switching between present time focus and future planning can be problematic. If you limit reflection to certain times and separate it from the daily work, you could stay critical and reflecting but still get the payoff and well being from focusing right now. All you need is to find the switch off button.

Sounds great, doesn’t it? It is difficult to deny the benefits of a college education; it is even more difficult to propose policy changes that could potentially deny access to it.
A few weeks ago, the New York Fed released an updated version of its 2015 study that found a correlation between increased federal aid and rising tuition costs, hinting at causation. Simply put, the more money the government pours into student aid, the more colleges raise tuitions.
In 2015, the Wall Street Journal compared rising tuition rates to the housing bubble; federal student loans allow Americans to borrow at below-market rates without assessing repayment ability or credit.
The analysis echoes former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett’s hypothesis; increasing financial aid enables “colleges and universities blithely to raise their tuitions, confident that Federal loans subsidies would help cushion the increase.” Is that true?
Maybe it is. Let us briefly digress into economic theory. Human capital theory tells us that the more schooling you get, the more skills you earn, and therefore the better you do in the marketplace. On the other hand, signaling theory states that a degree is a signal of aptitude and ability to be a good worker.
Based on Michael Spence’s model, there are high-ability and low-ability workers, whose skills are difficult to observe by employers; thus, they require a “signal.” Within education, the degree is the signal: if you hold a Bachelor’s degree, you are more qualified for a job than someone with a high school diploma. However, federal aid compromises that signal.
As a result of increased federal aid, more students are able to go to college, and thereby attain a degree. When the government makes it easier for all students to get a degree, the degree no longer indicates skill but rather one’s ability to obtain aid; thus, the signal is compromised. As a result, employers increase their standards and turn education into a game of hoop jumping—the more hoops you jump through, the better qualified you are for a job.
Professor Bryan Caplan at George Mason University amusingly illustrates signaling theory with the example of being at a concert and not being able to see. If you cannot see, then stand up and you will see better; therefore it follows that if everyone stands up, then everyone will see better. False. Likewise with education, the more diplomas that are stamped, the more level the playing field becomes, and the more difficult it is to distinguish yourself.
There is no simple answer to this problem. Following the signaling theory, we should eliminate federal funding for higher education. However, that would eliminate the possibility of a college education for those that cannot afford it. Perhaps the answer is to reassess what constitutes an eligible recipient of federal aid.
What do you think?
Editor’s Note: Young Americans for Liberty will be hosting an open forum on college affordability on Monday, Nov. 14, during common hour. Location TBD. Pooja Bachani is part of the YAL club.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity held its first Lip Sync Battle at the Hillwood Recital Hall on Nov. 2. The Lip Sync battle was held to raise awareness for the Children’s Miracle Network.
The Lip Sync battle consisted of three teams: “Tri Chi,” which included three brothers from Theta Chi fraternity; “Deez Nuts,” which included five members of Delta Zeta sorority; and “Xi Notes” from Alpha Xi Delta sorority. Each team signed up to participate prior to performing and were able to pick their own songs and made up their own dance. Some of the songs featured were “Wannabe” by Spice Girls, “Let It Go” by Idina Menzel, a remix of “London Bridge” and “7 Things” by Miley Cyrus.
A raffle was held in which students were able to win prizes such as snacks, a drone, heated blanket, and autographed New York Islanders memorabilia. The event cost $2 to enter. Some of the judges included Mickie Ramson, Matt Blanar and Ryan Day, who all work for campus life.
The event was well received by those who attended. There were approximately 40 people at the event.
Philip Lundgren, Philanthropy Chairperson of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, said, “It’s a fun event, to watch people perform and make a fool of themselves.”
Greg Vavrinec, President of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, was the host of the show. “I might be doing this again in the spring, the turnout was great and I am hoping for an even better turnout in the spring,” he said. “On top of that, we were able to raise money for a great cause.
After the performances, the teams were judged on their performance, costume and readiness. “Tri Chi” took first place, winning a $40 Buffalo Wild Wings gift card. Second place was “Deez Nuts,” and third place was “Xi notes.” Both teams received candy baskets made by the fraternity.
Ryan Gioe, vice president of Theta Chi and winner of the Lip Sync battle, said, “everyone did a really amazing job, but I think what made us win was us just having fun with it. Between Aaron Copper being a theater major and Mehrdad Mohtarami stealing the show with his wig drop. The crowd loved us.”
The Children’s Miracle Network Hospital raises funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals that provide 32 million treatments each year to kids across the U.S. and Canada. Donations go to hospitals around the area that are members of the Children’s Miracle Network. Sigma Alpha Epsilon chose this organization because they are nationally partnered with the Children’s Miracle Network.
“It doesn’t have too much to do with the fraternity, we thought it would be a really fun concept to get people involved to donate to a good cause,” Vavrinec said.
The event raised roughly $100 and went on for about an hour. The fraternity is hoping to bring the Lip Sync contest to campus again next semester with hopes to raise more money.

Known for his award-winning performances on the big-screen, 41-year-old Academy Award Winning Actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, on Oct. 30 delivered a marvelous piece of investigative journalism by way of a documentary on National Geographic Channel, titled “Before the Flood.”
Roughly 90 minutes long, Nat Geo’s cameras followed DiCaprio across the planet. From the disappearing rainforests of Indonesia, to the melting, blackening ice caps of Greenland, DiCaprio inserted himself on the front lines of climate change. The film started when DiCaprio introduced his boyish charm, inviting the audience into his crib that sat below an image by Hieronymus Bosch.
Bosch’s painting illustrates the three stages of humanity’s relationship with Earth. The first image on the left describes a peaceful coexistence between Earth and mankind; it’s a happy medium, a sustainable transaction of give and take. But the second image paints a much different story. Here, Earth is crowded and animals are used solely to serve mankind. Even Earth’s landscape is manipulated, as large manmade structures replace Earth’s natural features.
The last image on the right tells a much different story as Earth’s pristine landscape in scorched. Drained of its natural resources, mankind fights with one another for whatever is left. The animals are all but gone, and the world has entered the abyss: the point of no return.
DiCaprio tied and based his documentary around this image of Bosch’s painting. He kicked off the film by traveling to China, witnessing first- hand how the irresponsible burning of fossil fuels has choked China’s urban residents by way of toxic smog. DiCaprio then met with Indian officials, who explained to him how irregular weather patterns have destroyed farmland by way of flood or drought.
Mired in disbelief, DiCaprio traveled to the rainforests of Indonesia, the last place on earth where tigers, elephants, rhinos and primates all coexist with one another. DiCaprio’s love affair with these lands is short-lived after learning that these forests are burned and destroyed every day and are re-placed with fields designed to produce vegetable oil.
This is a double-edged sword, as when the forests are burned, they act like a carbon bomb and emit tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Who’s profiting off of this? According to the documentary, Pepsico, Smart Ones, and Burger King are some of the corporations behind the operation, reaping the rewards of this carbon catastrophe.
DiCaprio didn’t stop there, as he learned how Greenland’s ice cap is melting at a record rate and changing its color from white to gray, causing Greenland to melt faster than anticipated. He also discovered how cattle produce the greenhouse gas methane, which warms the planet even further.
According to the documentary, all of these factors are destroying our planet. DiCaprio successfully makes the connection that global warming will soon become an economic and national security issue, and how the scarce amount of resources may lead to global conflict.
The film also featured a one-on-one interview with George Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University, who served as a top-economic policy advisor to President George W. Bush. Mankiw explains how a ‘Carbon Tax’ may help cut carbon emissions. He cited the tax on cigarettes and how it led to a decline in smoking amongst Americans. Mankiw also explained how a Carbon Tax doesn’t necessarily mean a tax hike, but rather a tax shift.
DiCaprio also interviewed Tesla’s CEO and Head Scientist, Elon Musk. Musk explained how Tesla’s new electric car and solar panels could lead the way in breaking our carbon addiction. Before the end of the film, DiCaprio even interviewed President Obama and Pope Francis, who both stressed similar sentiments, stating how we must take care of our planet before it’s too late, and how changes in policy can eventually reverse our climatic woes.
The film ends with DiCaprio addressing the United Nations, stating how “scared to death” he was when he learned about the effects of climate change while filming “Before the Flood.” DiCaprio then called the room of world leaders “our last hope,” before walking off stage accompanied by a thunderous applause.
It doesn’t matter if you like or dislike Leonardo DiCaprio, or whether you believe or don’t believe in climate change, this documentary was beyond powerful. It’s an insightful piece, and a journalistic masterpiece.
“Before the Flood” can be viewed on YouTube, Netflix, and NatGeo.com, for free.

Pop and folk music collided in a spectacular performance by upcoming singer, songwriter, and New York-native, Annika Bennett. In a one-room restaurant in Queens called Swing the Teapot, 19-year-old Bennett played 23 songs to a small crowd over the course of a two-hour concert on Oct. 30.
The restaurant quickly filled up with audience members a half-hour before the concert, and soon enough, nearly every chair was filled. Bennett had a personal connection to the audience, as some of her family and friends were in attendance. While playing in front of family may add pressure to an artist while performing, Bennett showed no sign of stress, as she was extremely confident on stage.
One of Bennett’s qualities that immediately stood out was her personality. Between each song, Bennett talked to the crowd by describing her inspiration for the song or telling them where she wrote it. These quick interactions established a relationship between her and the audience, and made everyone feel like they were having a one-on-one conversation with her.
After playing the first song, called “Chore,” Bennett revealed that she lived in Nashville for the summer and co-wrote several new songs with other musicians. Her time in Nashville seemed to leave an impact on her music, as several songs contained a hint of country besides her folk and pop roots.
By building this rapport with the crowd, Bennett allowed her humorous side to reveal itself on several occasions. Before she played “Fire with Fire,” Bennett said that she co-wrote the song with two men in their fifties who were inspired to write parts of the song from past fights with their wives. This resulted in an eruption of laughter from the crowd, as Bennett reassured everyone that this was not the case with her— she’s never had a wife.
Besides writing or co-writing all of her songs, Bennett also plays an acoustic guitar to accompany her vocals. The concert was a mix of Bennett’s old and new songs, where “Cali- fornia” and “A Million Things” are off of her al- bum Seventeen. Others, like “L.A. Time,” were so new that she was still deciding on what to name them. Bennett’s style is a mix of pop and folk music. Despite the differing genres, Bennett made it work wonderfully, and switched between the two or blended them together in a single song.
One of the more effective songs played during the evening was called “I Lost My Heart,” which Bennett wrote before moving to Nashville. This song was very moving to the audience, as several dried their eyes after it was over. With “I Lost My Heart,” Bennett painted a perfect picture of the feelings one gets walking through New York City, and how hard it is to leave it behind.
Another popular song included “Tryna Fall in Love.” Bennett’s pop lyrics and vocals echoed shades of singer Colbie Caillat and created a very catchy and upbeat song. Several other standouts included “A Million Things,” “Eclipse,” and “Marlboro Lane.”
After leaving the stage for the last time, Bennett was persuaded to step back up and play one more song, a cover of the Jackson 5 hit, “I Want You Back.” Her performance in this song was also very impressive for the young artist. She stayed true to the original roots of the song and made it unique to her own style, allowing it to fit in easily with the rest of her repertoire.
While the crowd would clap for Bennett after every song, she received the biggest ovation at the end of the concert. In the hands of other artists, playing 23 songs may have dragged out the concert but Bennett found a way to make each one memorable and kept the crowd thoroughly engaged throughout the duration of the performance.
If this concert was any indication, Annika Bennett has a long career ahead of her and the music industry should prepare itself for the next breakout star on the folk and pop scene.

An Ouija board is not your everyday Monopoly board game. While it may look like a children’s game, spiritualists believe that the board allows the living to communicate with the dead.
“Ouija,” an American supernatural horror film directed by Stiles White, was released on Oct. 24, 2014. Despite receiving low critical scores, the movie was a hit with audiences, receiving $103.6 million at the worldwide box office.
Last month, two years after its original release, a Mike Flanagan-directed sequel was released. On Oct. 21, Universal Studios released “OUIJA: Origin of Evil.” It has nearly grossed over $45 million in two weeks and has received many positive reviews from critics, who have praised the film as an improvement from “Ouija.”

On Oct. 21, Universal Studios released “OUIJA: Origin of Evil.” It has nearly grossed over $45 million in two weeks and has received many positive reviews from critics, who have praised the film as an improvement from “Ouija.”
The first “Ouija” seemed to take place in present times, but “OUIJA: Origin of Evil” takes us back to the ‘60s. A widowed mother, Alice (Elizabeth Reaser), and her two daughters, Paulina (Annalise Basso) and Doris (Lulu Wilson), are busy running a scam; they trick customers into believing they are talking to dead loved ones. Although it is a hoax, Alice is desperate to support her children and truly believes that they are helping people find closure. But in reality, it’s all a lie. After using their own methods, Alice runs into an Ouija board at a store while shopping for home goods and decides to buy it to add as a prop.
While using the board, Doris begins to actually make contact with the dead. Doris makes new spiritual friends and helps her mom with psychic issues. She even finds some money in the walls of the house thanks to a tip from one of her spiritual contacts. Later in the film, we come across Father Tom (Henry Thomas), the principal of the school that Doris and Paulina attend. Father Tom doesn’t accomplish anything when it comes to the family’s battle against the spirits conjured by the Ouija board, although he was asked to help out with Doris as she encounters a spirit within her. Doris’ behavior begins to get strange and unpredictable, leading to horrifying, growing evil revelations.
It is safe to say that “Origin of Evil” is an improvement over its predecessor. It keeps the focus on the family. The production design really helps with the creepy atmosphere. The leap in quality from the first film to this one is impressive.
OUIJA: Origin of Evil is rated PG-13 and is now playing in theaters.

The sixth annual Gold Coast International Film Festival will take place from Nov. 9 through Nov. 15 at numerous locations on Long Island, including two events on the Post campus. On Nov. 9, there will be a screening of the short-film, “Joe’s Violin,” in the Hillwood Recital Hall at 8 p.m. On Nov. 10, there will be the special event, “New York Spotlight Program,” in the Gold Coast Cinema at 11:30 a.m.
The Gold Coast International Theatre Festival was created by the Gold Coast Arts Center, a nonprofit visual and performing arts center in Great Neck, N.Y., “with the purpose of establishing a home on Long Island to showcase the work of exceptional filmmakers and provide the public with an insider’s view of the film industry,” according to the festival’s website.
Focused on the North Shore of Long Island, the festival pays homage to actors, directors, producers, composers and entrepreneurs who lived and found inspiration in that area in the early 20th century. These stars include Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Francis Ford Coppola, and Joan Crawford. The festival aids the Gold Coast Arts Center in its mission of “promoting and supporting the arts through education, exhibition, performance and outreach,” as stated on goldcoastarts.org.
The university became involved in the festival two years ago with the help of Susan Zeig, director of the film program. “I established a relationship with Caroline Sarokoff, the director of the festival, that was facilitated by the SVPA Dean at that time. We started to talk about ways we could collaborate, and last year LIU was able to host the festival’s opening night showcase, which was a night with filmmaker Morgan Spurlock,” Zeig said. “We also put together a showcase of LIU Post student films that the festival promoted and screened with a panel in our Cinema at Hillwood. Those experiences were both very positive. Caroline wanted to try this short film showcase with a panel that includes film industry professionals this year, and I thought it was a good idea.”
Zeig also discussed what benefits the festival provides to students. “Establishing personal relationships with the local film festivals is a valuable opportunity for our students to get their work out into the world. Over the years, our students have won many prizes at LIIFE – Long Island International Film Expo 2016 held each year at the Bellmore Movies Theater,” she said. “This festival showcases feature-length independent films from all over the globe during this weeklong film festival. Last year, one of our short films, ‘My Friend John,’ won best student film. Our students do enter festivals in New York City and as far away as San Francisco, and have had good results, but having a personal connection with a festival nearby can produce long lasting results.”
The first event on campus, the screening of “Joe’s Violin,” takes place on Wednesday, Nov. 9 at 8 p.m. in the Hillwood Recital Hall. With a running time of about 23 minutes, the short film follows the true story of Joseph Feingold, a 91-year-old Polish Holocaust survivor who donates his violin to a local instrument drive. The instrument ends up changing both his life, and the life of Brianna Perez, the teenager from South Bronx who receives it.
Directed and produced by Kahane Cooperman, and produced by, Raphaela Neihausen, the film was nominated for the Tribeca Film Festival Best Documentary Short Film in 2016. After the screening, there will be a Q&A with Perez and her teacher, Kokoe Tanaka-Suwan, as well as a performance by the LIU Post String Ensemble, and invited high school guest musicians from the area, conducted by Music Professor Maureen Hynes. Tickets for the event are $15, but students can buy discounted tickets for $13.
The second event on campus is the “New York Spotlight Program” on Nov. 10 at 11:30 a.m. in the Gold Coast Cinema. Eight short films including, “Last Resort,” “Adija,” “Good Business,” “Subway Love,” “Mired,” “The Tailor,” “We Live This” and “Stop Making Murderers Famous,” will be screened.
After the screening, there will be a Q&A session with the guests, including Lawrence Smith of Mad Riot Entertainment, David Paterson, screen- writer/producer of Lionsgate’s “The Great Gilly Hopkins,” and Disney’s “Bridge To Terabithia,” as well as filmmakers Frank Dale Arroyo, Gordon Grinberg, Neil Holland, Ramfis Myrthil, David Schneiderman and Max Stossel.
This event is free, though it is recommended to reserve tickets at goldcoastfilfestival.org to guarantee entry.
Thirty other films will be screened as part of the festival at Bow Tie Great Neck-Squire Cinemas, Bow Tie Manhasset Cinemas, Bow Tie Port Washington Cinemas, Soundview Cinemas, Bow Tie Roslyn Cinemas, Gold Coast Arts Center and the Port Washington Public Library.

In the midst of an unbeaten streak that dates back to Sept. 17, no. 22-ranked women’s soccer extended that streak with a 2-0 victory against Mercy College on Wednesday, Nov. 2, in the East Coast Conference semifinals at home.
The Pioneers and Mavericks were in a scoreless heat that lasted for most of the first half until Sarah McGarry made a play in the 41st minute. The senior midfielder sent a cross into the box, which eventually made its way to freshman midfielder, Veronica Saager, who headed the opening tally into the mesh for a 1-0 Pioneer lead. That lead held up until the first-half whistle.
In the latter stanza, the Green and Gold were awarded a penalty kick and sophomore back/midfielder, Alice Schonfeldt, converted.
In net, sophomore keeper Hillevi Eklow made seven saves, six of which came in the second half, to earn yet another shut-out. The Pioneers won eight consecutive matches via the shutout and haven’t surrendered a goal since Oct. 8.
The win solidified the team’s place in the ECC Championship game against the University of Bridgeport on Friday, Nov. 4. In that matchup, the magical run of consecutive wins and shutouts ended as the team was hit with a 2-0 loss.
Although the first half featured zero goals, the Pioneers trailed in shots 7-4. That only got worse in the second half, as they were outshot 13-1. The Purple Knights converted on two of those 13 shots and the Pioneers simply didn’t have an answer.
If one team was the Pioneer’s Achilles heel this season, it was the Purple Knights. The no. 7-ranked team has two victories over LIU, both of them by identical scores. The loss drops the Pioneers to 14-3-2 on the season.
“It has been a challenging season for us where we have had stretches in the season where we played really well, and stretches where we have played really bad,” said sophomore forward, Andrea Huntzinger. “But I think I speak for the whole team when I say we are very happy with the results. We’ve learned from and corrected the mistakes we made in our last games and I have the utmost confidence in [us] going to the finals and bringing home the trophy.”
The Pioneers earned a bid to the NCAA Division II Tournament and will play Caldwell University on Friday, Nov. 11, in Garden City, N.Y. In their matchup earlier this season, the Pioneers came out on top, 4-0.
