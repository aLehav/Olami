When I first entered PTW, I was a little bit nervous. I’ve had a not-so-great experience with schools in my life, but I was still willing to give it a go, just because I needed a change in my life. From the first time I entered this class till now, I’ve come to enjoy my time in this special program. The instructors are nice and supportive, the students are fun, exciting to meet, and the atmosphere is nice making it easy for us to learn at our own pace. Never before have I ever stepped foot in such a positive program! 
Let me explain what PTW is. PTW is a new program housed in the CCI office on the campus of LIU-Post. PTW stands for Positive Transitions to Work. It is offered by PBS Consulting to help meet the needs of young adults with developmental disabilities so they can prepare to enter the world of work. 
PTW meets on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9am to 2pm. PTW students range in age from 18 to 30. The application process to PTW is pretty demanding and includes an in-person interview. Acceptance into PTW is about 29% so I am proud of my place here. 
PTW focuses on learning about soft work skills which are so necessary to success at work. We also learn about three fields of career each semester. The goal of the ‘career dives’ is to learn how we can find work in an area we are passionate about. I have learned that people with developmental disabilities have more opportunities than I realized in the adult world. Work is important because you make money in order to support yourself, you don’t get to be a burden to others, and you can broaden your horizons. 
The day in PTW starts with a lively discussion of current events which allows discussion based on both student perspective and needs. We do daily research on current events in order to stay informed about the world and to prepare for participating in this discussion. This is the first time I have ever witnessed a classroom experience where the students were consistently happy and excited for school. This atmosphere encourages each student to participate regularly in current events. 
We have a daily soft skill class where we learn about what they call “soft work skills”; which are behavioral traits and characteristics that are supposed to help you excel in the workplace. Soft work skills are integral to obtaining and maintaining a job or career. 
We explore three deep dives into various career fields each semester. We are also learning to use technology: google slides, google forms, email, email folders, etc. We keep a Google Slide presentation in our soft work skill class. We include information on our assignments or subjects on our Google Slides just to keep ourselves orderly and to have a dynamic history of our learning. Instead of stressful and tight work ethics, the program enables us to learn through consistency and reminders until we engrain it into our minds.
The last part of our day is meeting with our mentors. PTW hosts mentors from the education, special education, social work and speech departments here at LIU-Post. 
During my first year in PTW, I’ve finally learned the one thing I really want to do; write my stories. I’ve always had thoughts and ideas about adventures and cool stories in my head ever since I was a kid, but I couldn’t really pursue my dream due to fear that I was unable to meet society’s expectations. But now I’m confident that this is what I want to do and that I am capable of becoming a creative writer. 
To prepare for writing this article, I’ve interviewed some of my fellow classmates in PTW to understand how they feel about the program. This preparation helped me round out my article so it is inclusive of the inaugural PTW students and does not simply reflect my opinions. 
“I think it’s a great program, it helps people with disabilities, it’s very open to everyone’s beliefs, realities, personal opinions, and sexualities,” – my classmate Tommy said 
“My favorite thing about PTW is meeting new friends, getting to know the mentors and having fun in class,” – my classmate Nora said
Most students believe the program is good, but feel it could benefit from more planning and structure. Some also believed that the mention of politics in the classroom is controversial and should be more limited so as to not offend somebody. Nevertheless, everyone said they enjoyed the program, and that they would recommend it to friends and acquaintances. What they liked the most about the program was meeting new friends and the helpful instructors, mentors, and staff they met. 
Prior to starting PTW, I had a few hang-ups interfering with my ability to work or even maintain friendships. I have learned that I was not alone in this, some of my peers had inhibitions related to friendships too. This is mainly from putting up with the attitude and problems we encountered when many of us have been picked on, judged harshly or misunderstood. Through my participation in PTW, I have grown past my injurious experiences and am different now. I truly recommend Positive Transitions to Work for students and people with disabilities to enter in the hopes of achieving a brighter dream and a brighter future.

“Come on Harry, we want to say goodnight to you,” begins the opening to Harry Styles newest single. 
Styles is back and better than ever. On March 31 at 7 p.m., Styles released a music video to his new song ‘As It Was.’ This unlocked a new era for Harry fans around the world. This is his first song in two years since the release of his last album ‘Fine Line’. It has been a long wait for new music but it was all worth it in the end. 
This new era for Styles is definitely a big change. In his previous albums, his leading singles, “Sign of the Times” and “Light’s Up” were all just singing and walking around the set, but in “As It Was”, students think that he makes a grand statement. He starts with an emotional heart-to-heart with his dance partner as if there is some conflict between them. They dance in circles as if  “Gravity is holding me back” as Styles sings in the song. Towards the end of the video Styles breaks into his own little dance routine feeling free and happy. 
“Harry looked phenomenal in his new video. His love for his music is incredible. His “ballet” dancing just shows that he’s having fun,” freshman at Hofstra University Kaylah Rivera said. “He looks like he is genuinely having fun and he looks the happiest he’s ever been. It makes me so happy to see that he’s enjoying himself and proud of all his work.” 
This is one of Styles most emotional yet powerful songs he has ever released. He sings about personal transitions with lyrics such as, “In this world it’s just us. You know it’s not the same as it was.” 
Fans are already reacting positively to the single.
 “I feel like ‘As It Was’ is going to be THE song of the summer,” freshman musical theater major Grace McNally said.
The video was filmed in London by Ukrainian director Tanu Munio.
“Directing a Harry Styles video was a bucket list dream come true for me as he’s my favorite performer, shooting him was bittersweet as it was one of the happiest days of my life, but on the second day of the shoot, my country Ukraine was invaded so you can imagine the insane emotions we had while shooting,” Munio said in a recent interview. “Me and my team from Ukraine poured so much love into this video and you can see it on screen.”
“The entire time I watched the video I felt this immense amount of love through my screen. The long hugs Harry does with his dance partner makes you feel some type of way. Just the way they connect with each other was just perfect. I can’t stop watching it,” junior at Queens College Lauren Hernandez said.
This is the first real taste we will get of Styles until May 20, when he is set to release his third studio album, “Harry’s Home.”​​ Fans have been invited to his home via this album, which will have 13 tracks with feelings of coziness. There are not a lot of details on the upcoming album, but fans are excited. 
As the album release date gets closer, Styles has been leaving clues for fans on what to expect on the record. There has been a new instagram account created called “You Are Home.” This account has been posting photos since March 19. The posts are pictures of doors opened a little to see a photo in the background. Fans have been saying each photo is a clue as to what each song is about. Some example photos are grapes, the earth, mushrooms, a drawing of a sun and a lamp. As of right now there are 12 doors opened and fans are hoping to get more.
Styles has become a master of mixing pop music with raw emotion and although  his solo career has been launched for about 5 years now, this is just the beginning for him.

On Feb. 27 2022, Pokémon released a trailer for the next mainline game in the franchise, “Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.” Although Pokémon is one of the most successful video game franchises in the world, many Pokémon fans are aware that the series is far from perfect.
Students have spoken out about their hopes and concerns for the new game. 
Junior musical theater major Maple Hunt expects this new game to be better than the previous generation Sword and Shield, which was notorious for not having all the Pokémon in it upon initial release. 
“Although [Sword and Shield] was definitely fun I didn’t play the DLC [downloadable content] so I feel like I missed out on a lot of the content,” Hunt said. 
The mainline Pokémon games have been using the same Pokémon models since its initial jump to 3D graphics in 2013. However, the recent trailer showcased new Pokémon rendering, the added textures make the game look more polished overall.   
After years of controversy surrounding the graphics of the mainline Pokémon games, Hunt has given up on expecting good visuals.  
“I think the jump to 3D was fun but after that it sort of plateaued,” Hunt said.
Junior journalism major Caleb Palmer thinks that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet looks fine for what it is. 
“The Nintendo Switch isn’t the most powerful console out there when it comes to visuals, but for what they were able to work with and from what we saw from the trailer it looks very nice,” Palmer said. 
Gamefreak, the studio behind Pokémon, has a team of only 167 employees as of 2021. 
“Pokémon Scarlet and Violet” is scheduled to release late 2022 and there’s growing concern about how soon this game is coming out. 
“I’m concerned for the people working on it at Gamefreak. They’re definitely doing some kinda crunching there which is really sad,” Palmer said.
  Students believe things should change, not just for the game developers, but for the consumers who will be playing a game that was rushed out the door like the aforementioned “Sword and Shield” game. 
  Junior musical theatre major Cameron Stanek is weary about paying 60 dollars for a game that seems unfinished.
“The gaming industry as of late has had a very bad habit of rushing games in order to make a profit. Pokémon is the largest franchise on Earth, so unfortunately if they choose to, they can afford to cut corners,” Stanek said. 
Despite the controversy, students are still finding things to look forward to. Pokémon games are pretty by the books in terms of formula. However, the new game seems to be straying away from the traditional gameplay. 
  “It seems like these games will have some open world elements from Legends Arceus in them, and I’m very happy that the Pokémon Company is trying new things with these games,” Stanek said.
Another reason to be excited for the game is for the new Pokémon. Just like with every main series game, trainers must choose between three starter Pokémon which will accompany them on their journey. 
For this iteration, students must choose from Sprigatito the grass type cat,
Fuecoco the fire type crocodile, and Quaxly the water type duck. 
“I believe I have chosen the water starter for every Pokémon game I’ve played. However, Fuecoco is amazing and won over my heart very quickly, so I will most certainly be choosing them,” Stanek said.
  As for Hunt and Palmer, they are both on team Sprigatito. Preorders for “Pokémon Scarlet and Violet” are available now.

The NBA regular season has finally come to a close. Although the Nets have clinched a spot in the play-in games for the playoffs, the Knicks have missed the playoffs. After having been the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference after last season, the Knicks failed to follow up on that success this season. The Knicks finished with a 37-45 record overall, which netted them eleventh place in the Eastern Conference. 
The Knicks faced a series of problems throughout this NBA season that caused them not to make the playoffs. Senior communications major Dean Jonnaou commented on the Knicks issues.
“Last season, the Knicks had one of the top-ranked defenses, but their offense was below average,” Jonnaou said. “They let go of a couple of strong defenders in order to bring in offensive focused guards like Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. Unfortunately, this hurt the defense more than it helped the offense.” 
This year, the Knicks allowed an average of 106 points per game, two points more than the team last year. Although that may be expected, they also averaged one point less than they did the year prior, as they averaged 106 points per game this year. 
Sophomore broadcasting major Brady Campbell also shared similar thoughts on the Knicks season. 
“The players have also not played well. Julius Randle is nowhere near the player he was last year, and they rely too much on three-point shooting,” he said. “Their rebounding is also very poor and their defense can use some work.” 
Julius Randle, who was a focal point of the Knicks’ offensive success last season, didn’t have quite the same season. He averaged 20 points per game this season, four less than last season, while also shooting worse from the three-point line this season, going down from 41 percent to 30 percent.
Although the Knicks weren’t able to make the playoffs this season, Jonnaou explained that it may not be a reflection of how the team had success last season. 
“I wouldn’t call last season a fluke, but I believe that management was wrong to expect the minor changes they made to ensure the team would get back to the playoffs. I don’t think the win total this season is an egregious underperformance of the team’s talent,” he said. “If anything, last season the team over-performed, and this season the rest of the conference improved significantly.” 
The Eastern Conference has been a much stronger conference this year than last, with teams such as the Bulls, Cavaliers, and Hornets making it to the playoffs this season despite not making the playoffs last season.
When looking toward the off-season, especially free agency, Campbell believes that some changes need to be made within the Knicks organization. 
“There definitely has to be some changes for next season. I think they should trade Randle despite a great last season. This year it’s been pretty hard to watch, though, as he completely fizzles out by the fourth quarter,” Campbell said. “The team as a whole is exhausted by the fourth quarter, which I believe is part of why they keep blowing big leads. One would think that New York would be a great place to go to, but the team is managed too poorly. Hopefully, they can acquire assets that fit in nicely with players like Barrett, Toppin and Quickley for the future.” 
The Knicks will look to get back to the playoffs when the next season begins.

LIU Athletics recently added two new Assistant Directors of Athletic Media Relations, Donny Chiarel and Olivia Henley. They take on the role of helping all sports teams behind the scenes and making sure that everything runs smoothly. Covering every sport from Brooklyn to Post is no easy job, but these two have worked extremely hard through long days and hectic weekends.
Chiarel, a recent graduate of Wingate University, described how it worked out just right for him to be here at LIU.
“I graduated in December of 2021, but I found the job in August. I applied for it just because I wanted to be in this location and college athletics. Obviously, they didn’t offer it to me because I was still in school, but then December rolled around, and it was still available, so I interviewed, it was the right fit and here I am,” he said. “It’s wild, it just kind of fell into my lap, and the fact that it’s worked out this way and that I’ve been able to get this experience, I can’t really be upset about it.”
Before becoming a Shark, Chiarel was a Bulldog in North Carolina at Wingate University and mentioned how much of a great experience it was.
“I got my Bachelors in communication and sports broadcasting from Wingate University, a small Division II School 30 to 40 minutes out of Charlotte, NC. While I was there, I was very fortunate to get a lot of hands-on experience with the athletic department working in communications and broadcasting on pretty much every sport we had. I had a unique opportunity to do a lot of things in front of the camera and learn what I wanted to do,” Chiarel said. “Being involved in college athletics in a small environment where everybody I interacted with was coaches and athletes, it was very easy to walk into someone’s office or practice and get to know them on a personal level. When you are covering them, it’s cool to see a guy or girl succeed in whatever they’re doing, and that’s one thing I wouldn’t trade.”
Chiarel feels he had an advantage over someone who may have gone to a more competitive school due to more chances at productive work experience.
“I know people who went to school for broadcasting at bigger schools like Syracuse or South Carolina. At some of the bigger schools where it’s hard to stand out, you might fall through the cracks, so that was one thing I wouldn’t ever take for granted,” he said.
When thinking of his time on Long Island so far, Chiarel has made the most of his experience but is still getting used to a long winter.
“It’s been cool. It’s been an interesting transition because I did graduate early, so I technically should still be finishing my degree if I had stayed for the full four years. Everyone’s been really welcoming and kind, and it’s been easy to make friends that find similar interests. The world of sports can look like it’s so big, but in reality, it’s small. There’s a lot of things you can tie to a lot of people in a lot of different places, so that’s always been cool to learn,” he said. “Being in a new place is really exciting. It’s not the same in terms of weather, I’m still not used to wearing a puffer jacket in April, but we’re getting there. It’s been good learning a lot of new things like doing statistics and a lot of the written publications online, and just fulfilling the needs of coaches and players as they come, and it’s been a really fun first step out of college for sure.”
Chiarel spoke about his favorite sport to cover and his goals for the future.
“My heart is always in basketball, I’ve always been a big hoops guy, and it was cool to see our men’s team make a little bit of a run and win a lot towards the end of the regular season. For my goals, I would say, in some capacity, to be in front of the camera, and help operate at a high level in a very credible and well-known department. Whether it’s professional or college, to tell the stories of athletes and coaches because I think there’s a beauty in that,” he said. “Some people may think it’s the same sport all the time, but at the end of the day, no game or athlete is ever the same, so you can find the uniqueness of that and roll with it. As long as I can tell the stories of athletes and promote them in the best way that I can, I would say that’s what comes close to fulfilling the dream. Who knows where my career will take me, but I’m excited for it.”
Olivia Henley remembers how she found the job and found LIU a few years back.
“I’m the Assistant Director of Athletics Media Relations here in Brooklyn. Occasionally, I go out to Post. I found it through a website called CoSIDA, and a few years ago, right after I graduated undergrad, I had a friend who was a volunteer assistant coach for volleyball. When I saw the posting, I decided to head up to New York,” she said.
Henley mentioned her past before making the journey to New York and described her time here so far.
“Before I was at LIU, I was a recent graduate. I just got my masters in April of 2021 and was still working the two part-time jobs I had in Nashville throughout grad school before I decided to come up. I studied sport and administration at Belmont University, and the way Belmont structured that program was that you had to have an internship each semester. I had to take a finance class and a law class so you can get a full background in business, but with a focus on the sports industry,” she said. “My time here has been interesting. I have a lot of support in terms of the coaches’ understanding of the amount of work on my plate. I enjoy the environment, I like being in Brooklyn, and I like having the big city vibes. I lived in Chicago for a while, so coming back to the big city was nice for me, I like interacting with the players, and I don’t have a car, so with softball being at Post, I have to take the team bus, and it’s been a nice experience to interact with the players and see the personal side of why I got into sports in the first place.”
When thinking of her favorite sport, Olivia remembers back to her undergrad years as a reporter.
“As an undergrad, I was a reporter in my junior year. My favorite sport to report on was soccer, and I just loved working with our men’s soccer team. I loved the coach and the players. My favorite sport to work with here is tennis. Some matches can go an hour, and some go 3 1/2 hours, and you don’t know what you’re going to get when you show up,” she said. “I worked with both men’s and women’s tennis teams in undergrad, and I haven’t been involved with tennis before, but I enjoyed it. A sport that I’m looking forward to working with is water polo. I am their contact, and I’ve been to three matches now. It’s super exciting, so I’m excited to dive deeper and learn more about that sport itself.”
Olivia mentioned her dream job, and even though it would take her overseas, she would go in a heartbeat.
“It would probably be athletic communications or sport communications with either an English Premier League team or a Bundesliga team. I speak German, I followed the German National Team before I followed any other national team,” she said. “But also my heart belongs in England, Liverpool is my club, I’m kind of a ‘Do Or Die,’ watch on my phone while I’m at other events, type of person. I worked for Nashville SC when I was in Nashville, it was kind of different because I had never worked for professional sports before, I had worked the collegiate and national side. The environment of soccer is something that I have holistically enjoyed. Everyone’s super laid-back, it’s always a business casual dress for the day kind of thing. We would go play soccer on Fridays at work when I worked at US soccer and I just love that environment.”

Make-up has always been a key element in self expression and art, with many makeup artists rising to fame online testing products and looks. 
Make-up has remained a staple in our ever changing culture; representing a power in which women and men alike can feel free to be themselves. But as much as make-up has symbolized an inclusivity for all people, its marketing tactics are quick to forget a huge population group; hetrosexual, cis men.
“I feel like when talking about more mainstream types of guys, they are going to be like ‘oh, what the hell, what are you doing’, especially in younger men like highschool ages. There’s definitely a stigma against [guys wearing makeup],” sophomore psychology major Aaron White said.
This is quite shocking seeing that it has been a norm in American mainstream entertainment for men to wear makeup since the 1970s. Take for instance, a few of the biggest names of the decade- David Bowie, Boy George, Prince- all wore makeup regularly in concert.
In news, movies, tv shows, all actors and on screen entertainment wear makeup to look appealing for the camera, which seems rather practical when you consider that in many cases, people are watching from all over the world.
“A lot of people might think ‘thats a girly or gay thing to do,’ when I don’t know how people would make that link between makeup and sexuality. It’s really just how you wanna decorate yourself,” White said.
Not only have men been wearing makeup on-screen for decades, they have been the artists behind some of your favorite movie stars as well. Scott Barnes, one of Hollywood’s most well-known makeup artists, said in an interview with Byrdie, “There have always been men as makeup artists. Actually, right now, there are more female makeup artists than ever before.”
And according to statistics from a survey done in 2013 by the Huffington Post, there are a lot more men that wear makeup than we probably think. 
The survey found that 9 percent of men wore foundation, 11 percent wore bronzer, and 10 percent wore concealer. In those regards, it seems that by this point in 2022, makeup for men should be a bit more mainstream in the U.S..
In Eastern countries, such as South Korea, it seems like the industry for men and makeup is, at the very least, more open to the idea. Popular boy-band groups like BTS and EXO are regularly seen wearing makeup in photoshoots and performances, extenuating radiant and blemish-free faces.
Senior political science major Shawn Brown sees the shift in makeup becoming more popular for Korean men as a sign of the times.
“I feel like a lot of popular male artists now are toying with that idea of androgyny, especially with all the k-pop stuff.”
So why does it still feel so taboo for American hetrosexual men to wear makeup?
It seems that the answer lies within age. According to a 2019 Morning Consult survey done on 2,124 U.S. men, the differences found between the youngest and oldest age groups are remarkable.
In the polls regarding the question asking whether they would ever consider wearing makeup, 18 percent of men of ages 19 – 29 responded “Yes, maybe”. In the oldest age group ranging 65 and up, the answer was responded by only 8 percent of males. Going back to that youngest age group, the answer “yes, definitely” was responded by 15 percent, while the answer “no, never” was responded by 44 percent. On the other hand in the eldest group, the answer “yes, definitely” was responded by less than 6 percent and the answer “no, never” by 61 percent.
This difference is more acute in other tolls taken in the survey, such as for the statement “people like me do not wear makeup”, 46 percent of 18-29 year old men strongly agreed, while the toll for all men was 56 percent. Somewhat contradictory to this, in regards to the statement “ I care about my appearance”, 35 percent of the youngest age group strongly agreed, while the toll for all men was 40 percent.
In light of these statistics, it is important to note the differences between the oldest and youngest generations. When talking on the topic of makeup, we can see a huge generational shift taking place in the way men think about makeup. With the progression of time, men seem to get, well, more progressive. Pulling from that aforementioned Morning Consult study, in regards to young men ages 18-29, eight percent responded that they would definitely try makeup, apart from the three percent that already do. Out of the men who answered the survey, 11 percent said that they would try concealer, and 7 percent said they would definitely try lip gloss.
“I think it’s an undeniable fact that every generation slightly becomes more progressive in some sense. I think as generations keep going, they look to attacking traditional roles. I don’t think the pendulum pushes the other way, it continually goes in the way of challenging the norms,” Brown said.
In a time when we are fostering the notion that people should be true to themselves despite social media and public pushback, it feels like a step in the right direction.

Netflix released the much anticipated second season of “Bridgerton” and many fans are reporting mixed opinions on the season.
Back when season one was released, the news that Regé-Jean Page, the actor who played Simon, would not be returning in seasons to come, shocked fans. 
“I remember watching season one and then hearing that Simon would no longer be in the series. I didn’t think that the seasons to come afterward would be as good as the first one, but I think that season two was pretty good and they found a way to make it work,” sophomore business major Gabrielle Previti said.
Although many people doubted the show’s directors, season two received some positive feedback. Some characters seen in season one were not in season two, while there were some new characters brought to the show. 
Edwina Sharma, played by Charithra Chandran, and her sister, Kate Sharma, played by Simone Ashley were among the new characters of season two. Both of these actresses have now become fan favorites.
Instead of focusing on Daphne and Simon’s relationship, as season one did, this new season focuses on the complicated love triangle between the Sharma sisters and Daphne’s brother, Anthony. 
“I think it was necessary to have a complicated love story in this season because it held the viewer’s attention. It is something different than what we saw in season one with Daphne and Simon’s relationship,” sophomore  business major Maria Pochi said.
Many viewers also found Penelope’s storyline to be interesting this season. It was revealed that Penelope is Lady Whistledown   in season one, fans enjoyed watching her character in season two, especially after finding out her identity.
“I feel like all of the different storylines in this season really kept people interested and want to continue watching the show. I think it brought people’s hopes for the show back up since the news that Simon would definitely not be returning was released,” sophomore biology major Elizabeth Lebeshova said. 
Many fans are encouraging others to watch the new season because it exceeded their expectations.
Fans can look forward to seasons three and four of “Bridgerton,” which has already been announced through a formal letter from Lady Whistledown herself.

Money and fame go hand in hand. When an actor’s face pops up on the big screen, there is always the ready assumption that this person makes the big bucks- Hollywood is known to pay in dividends. 
In 2020, the Forbes list for the highest paid actors kicked off with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson holding first, raking in an acclaimed $23.5 million from Netflix that year alone. Ryan Reynolds held second: boasted a total income of $71.5 million. Mark Whalberg falling not too far under, raked in a calm $58 million. 
With the resumes of these Hollywood giants spanning decades in American media entertainment, money couldn’t be coming in faster. Although the allure of wealth and fame might be a draw of the acting industry, the number of those who actually do “make it” and benefit from even moderate fame or fortune is extremely small. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the average on-screen actor brings in a moderate sum of $52,000 annually, taken from statistics reported by the Screen Actors Guild. Furthermore, a great deal of these SAG actors are taking in far less. 
Many actors in the guild make an earning of around $1000 a year; an earning more or less equal to a couple of weeks working minimum wage in New York City. That being said, for actors just starting out in the industry, becoming a success, regardless of skill, is a challenge most cannot overcome. 
A study done by the Queen Mary University of London indicated that a mere 2 percent of actors make a living from the profession, and a whopping 90 percent are out of work and not regularly employed. 
Furthermore, the University’s research showed that “ the total number of jobs in a career is underpinned by a rich-get-richer phenomenon. In other words, the best known actors get the most jobs,” (Queen Mary University of London).
This is a rather heated topic in the media entertainment industry, as actors, actresses, and models who have already become successes, both usually end up taking the higher paying jobs due to their already garnered fame. 
In addition, many times their Hollywood prestige passes down the family tree, with recent controversial Oscars figure Will Smith being a prime example. Both of Smith’s and Jada Pinkett’s children have risen in popularity coming out of their teenage years, successfully breaking into the music industry. Accounting for their success, both individually are worth over $5 million each. 
These so-called “nepotism babies”, have riled up the media for their ease of access to what others so desperately search for. 
“If you’re the child of a famous actor, it’s pretty easy to get your parents to pull some strings, or be the lead in a new movie,” related freshman musical theater major Delia Hartman. “One actor off the top of my head was Ben Platt, his dad was a big time producer and his dad got him into a lot of interesting projects.” 
Although the reasoning behind boosting your children’s career would be the logical choice for anyone in their position, the impact of limiting a coveted job market has generated hefty pushback from social media. 
“Sometimes, it can be frustrating when you see people get roles taken away from them or people who you know have been working for a really long time to break into the industry but are not able to because someone who has some connections gets there first,” Hartman said. 
The controversy expands on the point of there already being a very, very small circle of people who have made it to Hollywood career level heights in the first place. Now, with Hollywood stars culminating heirs to their proverbial throne, that circle only gets smaller. 
“We have a morally imperfect world, so it’s not fair, but it’s how things work,” freshman broadcasting major Isabel Yun said. “Obviously, it is more deserving for those who did the hard work, but it’s not how our world works unfortunately.” 
On the other hand, there is the notion that acting skills, and other skills valued in the entertainment industry do tend to pass on either genetically or through influence from their parents. You can even say that some of these actors and actresses were bred to become talented actors and actresses themselves.
“The example coming off the top of my head is Maud Appatow. . . she comes from a family of incredible artists, and I think she’s incredible,” Hartman said. “She makes a lot of really active character choices. I think Maud is a great example of someone who might have come from privilege but deserves to be where she is.” 
Yet and still, the controversial term “nepo-babies” has become household in many ways, reflecting on the fact that much of the public sees it as unfair. 
“What’s tricky is, when you have nepotism on your side, it’s a lot easier to be in a lot of the right places at the right time,” Hartman said.

Senior musical theatre major Violet Taber can be described in two words; passion and drive. 
Originally from Syracuse, N.Y, Taber decided she wanted to come to Post for the musical theatre program.
“I really knew I wanted to pursue a degree in theatre, I auditioned at a bunch of schools, but it came down to LIU and one other school. It was the first time in my life that I had a gut feeling, and that feeling told me that LIU was the place to be. When I saw the theatre community on campus, I knew I wanted to be a part of that,” Taber said.
Over the course of her years at Post, Taber has become immersed in campus life and organizations inside and out of theatre. Taber is a member of Emerging Student Theatre Artists (ESTA), the campus theatre club.
“I auditioned in my freshman year and got in. Since then I have been in a show every year. I have even directed a show, and have been in so many. ESTA has been my biggest commitment through school. I made so many connections,” she said.
During her time performing at Post, Taber has played many different roles. However, her lead role in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” holds a personal significance.
“I am really proud of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” I got to be in the lead role. It’s one of the only roles in the musical theatre canon where the lead is written to be a trans person. That role meant a lot to me and I am really proud of it,” she said.
Taber also dabbled in writing. She worked for The Tide as a writer during her junior year, and was the co-arts and entertainment editor during her senior year.
“I loved being on the paper, but I had to focus on my career this semester. I love writing, and meeting the other editors was amazing. I have good memories of The Tide,” she said.
Taber is involved in inclusion and acceptance for students. She is a member of Rainbow Alliance, a group on campus dedicated to LGBTQ+ inclusivity for students. She described her passion for the club as a means of promoting community for all of the campus’s LGBTQ+ students.
“I have been a part of Rainbow Alliance. When I went to NYC Pride last year, I saw a bunch of people from LIU Rainbow Alliance who I knew, and it was great. There’s a queer community that exists in theatre, and I worry that other queer students don’t get that sense of community, and Rainbow Alliance gives them that sense of community,” she said.
When Taber looks back on her time in college, she is proud of the journey she has taken as an artist, as well as a woman.
“I am really proud of how far I have come as an individual, and of my personal journey. If you told me that my freshman year, I would’ve laughed. I am proud of how far I have come,” she said.
Taber’s art isn’t limited to her performances at Post, she also writes and produces her own music as Violet Stanza. She currently has 507 monthly listeners, and her songs average over 1,000 listens on spotify. She started making her music during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when she was back home.
“I would say I am a queer independent arist who makes indie pop music for people who fall in love too quickly. I started making music during the pandemic because I was separated from my art. I was acting and doing that from home was demoralizing, and I started making music from home. I have been singing my whole life and once I was able to produce that. It was great,” she said.
Taber released her first song, “Grandma’s Prius,” in Aug. 2020, and has since released three more songs since then.
“I have more coming. Music is the foundation of my art, and I will continue to make it. The music gets about 1,000 listens on spotify, and that means a lot to me. It’s really rewarding,” she added.
Taber plans to move to New York City after graduation, in order to be in the center of Manhattan’s theatre industry. She also plans on trying to get involved in television and modeling. 
“I want to do it all. I am ambitious, I’m gonna move to New York and throw a bunch of cards at the wall, and whichever cards stick I will stick with. I want to be involved in the arts scene as much as I can be,” she said. 
Taber also hopes to do work in the fashion industry as well. She currently works at a clothing store, and hopes to become a stylist in Manhattan.
She shared with me her advice for college students.
“My advice is listen to yourself and trust yourself. When there’s a lot being thrown at you, listen to your body and what it’s telling you. You know you the best. I hope you make that space for yourself, that’s what helped me the most here,” she said.
Lastly, Taber spoke directly to young musicians and artists. Her message: “Go for it.”
“Music takes hard work and dedication, but if you’re passionate, go after it. There’s so many people who are not great at guitar who are touring, and people who are not great singers with millions of listeners and are multi millionaires. If you’re passionate, do it,” she said.
She talked about classism in the industry, and how that has been changing and opening up opportunities for people.
Taber looks back on her time at Post fondly, and is excited to move onto what comes next.
“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs and I’m full of gratitude for the people I’ve met here. I’m ready for the next chapter,” she said.
