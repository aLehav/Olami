LIU Post’s Association for Campus Programming (ACP) had students hyped and anxious for Saturday’s homecoming with a week full of exciting events. Homecoming is a week dedicated to welcoming back alumni and also a time for current students to have fun, socialize, and partake in school pride. The week is very important to Post students for many reasons, and this year’s homecoming proved to be a success.
Jeremiah Aviles, sophomore Childhood Education major, said, “Homecoming is the core of LIU Post because it’s the anticipation of a crazy weekend.”
Main Events
Some of the main events were the pep rally, the homecoming carnival, the homecoming party, and the biggest event of the week was the homecoming football game.
The pep rally was held in the Pratt Center on Friday, Oct. 18. It was an enjoyable time for students to demonstrate Post pride and kick off the weekend. The pep rally consisted of performances by the Post dance team, cheerleaders, residence halls, and DJ S. Whit. The rally was also used to introduce LIU’s soccer, volleyball, swim, and football teams.
There was free food and Post giveaways for all guests. The Pratt was packed and the atmosphere was electric.
Alfred Cabera, sophomore Business Management major, believes that homecoming is the most popular school event throughout the year. “It’s the biggest social event of the year. Everyone participates in homecoming, even people from other schools,” said Cabera. “It’s a chance to meet your peers in a different environment.”
The Homecoming Carnival was a magnificent experience for students, families, and guests. The carnival was held in the Pratt and at Hickox Field at noon on Saturday and continued until 4 p.m.
Admission for the carnival was $15 and included a ticket to the football game and a barbeque lunch. There were rides, games, and club tables with promotions and activities.
Student Thoughts
Jesus Cardenas, senior Business and Film major, has always been excited and anxious for homecoming. “Homecoming has always been a time to take a step back from work and have fun with new and old friends,” he said.
“I’m excited about this year because Post is in a remodeling stage and we can make this the biggest homecoming and start new traditions with a new name,” he added.
The Homecoming Party is an annual celebration held on Saturday night for all LIU Post students and their guests to enjoy. The party has usually been held in the basement of Winnick, but this year it was moved to the Pratt Recreation Center to allow room for a greater audience.
Admission to the party was $5 for students and $10 for guests. Student Life, ACP, and a combination of student clubs and organizations hosted the party. The festivities were well attended and the venue was decorated with LIU Post colors and flashing lights.
Teresa Lisbet Ndong, sophomore International Business major, believes that this year’s homecoming was better than last year’s. “There were more fun activities this year, people seem friendlier, and everyone was having a great time together.”
Football Victory
The most important event of all is the homecoming football game. It’s the most anticipated event of the week, and the most popular. The LIU Post football team the Pioneers brought their “A-game” with them as they shutout Pace University in a 58-0 victory.
“I knew we were going to win, we were focused and ready to demolish Pace,” said Matthew Ferere, a sophomore defensive back for the Pioneers.
Homecoming 2013 was a great weekend for Post students to relax, have fun, and take a break from schoolwork just for a little bit. Most students enjoyed themselves and the Pioneer’s victory helped boost everybody’s energy.

A letter was sent home by Gale Stevens Haynes, provost and chief operating officer, informing students of an increase in tuition for the 2013-14 academic year, about a month before school started.
The letter stated that the university will implement “a modest increase,” a little over $1,200 more than the previous year. Undergraduate students will now be paying a flat rate of $16,185.
The tuition for the 2013-14 school year is now $32,370, without room and board fees. That’s not all; each student is also charged a university “activity” fee of $850 per semester. This money is supposed to go toward campus programming that you may or may not attend.
That puts the grand total for the average undergraduate student at $34,070. Last year the total was $32,862, and in 2009, tuition and fees for undergraduate students was $28,770.
Dramatic Increase
“I think that’s kind of crazy that I didn’t even realize that it increased so much in the four years that I was here,” said Sadie Hofler, senior Social Work major.
However, if you live on campus or have a meal plan that figure is higher. A student who resides in the dorms, depending on their choice of living style, could be paying an additional $6,610-$9,164. The meal plan on top of that could be a charge of anywhere between $3,900-$4,700.
With tuition and fees, the maximum for a meal plan and housing, a student could be paying $47,934 a year to attend Post. This does not include additional charges like health insurance, music lessons, books, and other school activities.
The letter sent by Haynes reports that “To help offset tuition, your institution has allocated $52.2 million in annual scholarship support and financial aid, which is in addition to federal and state aid.”
Aid Eligibility
Students are encouraged to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA) form to determine their eligibility for aid. The United States Department of Education determines eligibility by looking at parents’ income and assets, family household size and the number of family members attending college.
Students are awarded aid that is specific to them. However, there are also many other options available to seek aid elsewhere. Students can learn about federal aid programs, LIU Post scholarships, New York State aid programs, and other sources of assistance at liu.edu/post/finaid.
The amount of aid can vary each year and assistance can be taken away based on grade point average requirements.
Some students do not feel as though they are getting enough help with financial assistance. Marissa Kofmehl, a sophomore Public Relations major, said, “I have one scholarship, and then they were like, ‘good luck on your own.’”
Another student explained the fluctuation of his scholarships. “I’m getting help, but it went down from when I initially started coming [to Post]. They did help me a lot in the beginning, but now I don’t see how [tuition] went up, but I don’t see scholarships reflecting the same increase. ”The tuition increase letter by Haynes also said, “staffers can help you develop flexible payment plans.” However, Hofler said this was not the case. “It took a lot to get them to work with us to try to pay every- thing,” Hofler added.
Student Loans
Not all students will get enough financial assistance to pay for school, and many will have to take out loans. One of the most common companies that students use is SallieMae, which requires a co-signer and an interest rate of 3.17 percent to 9.37 percent.
How much are students willing to pay for an education? Is it worth it in the end? According to a study done by Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, 7.9 percent of college graduates are unemployed. In fact, recent graduates often have difficulties finding work within their major and about half are working at jobs that do not require a degree (research from Center for College Affordability and Productivity).
Troy Mossman, a senior Public Relations major, explained that he does not understand the year-to-year tuition increase, and sees no changes or reasons for the additional $1,200. Mossman concluded with, “This is what people get paid in a year. Middle class families or something under middle class are trying to support themselves and their child going to school at the same time. It’s just not fair.”
Operating Officer Gale Haynes and Joanne Graziano, associate provost of Financial Student Services, have not responded to requests for comment about the recent tuition increase.

Many students are unaware that money has been placed on all commuter students LIU ID cards. All students who are taking nine or more credits, according to Associate Provost Jessica Hayes, were issued $50 dollars on their ID cards. The money came from the students who paid $25 and the other half from LIU.
The money on the cards can be used to pay for food wherever there is a Blackboard scanner. While using your student ID card, students are getting a better dining than by paying with cash, credit, or debit because the ID card allows to students to avoid paying tax.
Regarding taxes on the meals, New York State does not require sales tax with student meal plans.
Similar to a debit card, though, each student has the option to put as much money on their card as they want, and when they use their card, the money is subtracted from the ID card balance.
Student Thoughts
“I already spent my $50,” said Felipe Lourido, a freshman with a Undecided major. “I have to find out how I can get more money on my card.” All full-time commuter students received $50 to get them started, but money can be added by going to the fill machine in Hillwood Commons or by visiting the Bursar Office. This new system was implemented this semester.
Students should be aware that the magnetic stripe on the back of each card is important. If that is left out in the heat or is somehow deformed, then a new ID card will be needed.
When asked about the $50 on his ID card, Ryan Freese, a freshman Education major, said,
“I love it. It’s so easy; I just whip out my card and it’s paid for. I use it for my coffee almost every morning.”
Quick And Easy 
The new LIU cards have also reduced the amount of time spent waiting on lines because of the new tap-and-go process, which allows students to tap their card against the Blackboard scanner.
This process of adding money will continue into the spring semester, and if all goes well into next year, as well according to the LIU website.
For students who are interested in meal plans, a commuter meal plan is something that is also offered at LIU Post. It is a similar plan to those students who live on campus and are required to be on a meal plan.

The month of October is known as Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
This is a time to honor and admire those who are fighting, or have at some point had to fight, the difficult battle against breast cancer. During this month, pink becomes the symbol of strength and hope for these individuals and their families. All over the world, money is being raised to help find the cure, and as college students, foundations everywhere encourage participating in something this important.
How To Get Involved
Raising money toward finding a cure is an important aspect of the month of October. The support and love that is given during this month is what helps those who are suffering from the disease have faith that they will win their battle. By donating to this cause we may make a difference in an individual’s life. If we all work together and keep this fight going, hopefully we will be able to live in a world where breast cancer does not exist.

LIU Post may have standards that set it apart from other colleges and universities. However, like any other university, LIU Post changes with the times as well. The question to ask is: what are some changes that LIU Post students have noticed for the new fall season?
Student Thoughts
Janey Gemmell, a junior Electronic Media major, stated, “Well,
I do know that we have a new president. However, I’ve also noticed a change in the students themselves.” Gemmell continued, “More and more people just keep to themselves. People don’t really hang out on the great lawn anymore. The scene has just changed.”
Meanwhile, other students like Scott Haddock, a sophomore Business Administration major, noticed changes in the look of LIU Post. “I have noticed that they have been doing more landscaping, and there are two big generators outside Humanities.”
Haddock was asked why he thought that was, and he stated, “I think they did that in the case of another hurricane. It would definitely help my classes stay open!” Haddock laughed.
Cara Frank, a junior Electronic Media major, hasn’t really heard much regarding changes at LIU Post, though she did hear one thing
that has other students buzzing about. “All that I really know is that the school is trying to get a stadium built for the football field. That would be awesome,” Frank expressed.
Some students, like Steve Colombero, a junior Broadcast major, have observed a lot about the scenery. “I’ve noticed a lot of changes with appearance to the school with the landscape around campus, and just how everything is either more updated or clean,” he stated. Colombero also reiterated the fact that, “Campus life has definitely gone down as well as enrollment.”
Kat Kazaba, a sophomore Public Relations major, spoke out on changes occurring within the Athletic Department. Kazaba stated, “As a returning student athlete here at Post, the most noticeable change I’ve seen this semester has been within the athletic department.” She also stated that, “President Cline has added a few new sports to the program, which has the Pratt center inquisitive and excited.”
While some aspects of campus life may have gone down, Post is not down and out. Students and staff alike are using their best efforts to keep Post on top, while providing new innovations and staying full of Post pride.

Living on campus can be both pleasant and unpleasant for any college student. However, living on campus this year at LIU Post may just be unbearable. As college students, we depend on our devices to get us through the day. With all the students now using the WiFi at once, surfing the web has become much more difficult.
Routers Now Allowed
Last semester, the Office of Residential Life did not allow routers in any of the dorm rooms. Beginning this year, the rule was changed due to common complaints made by students throughout the dorms about the slow Internet connection.
For the past couple of years, Residential Life has allowed students to use Ethernet. The process of using Ethernet is simple. All that is needed is an Ethernet cord. One end goes into the Ethernet jack located on the wall of a dorm room and the other end just gets plugged into the device. This helped the internet run faster, but could also be frustrating due to the fact that the device could not stray far from the Ethernet jack located on the wall without falling out. With routers now permitted in the dorms, students are now able to connect to WiFi.
Routers Make WiFi Slower
Phil Armato, junior Accounting major, said, “I still use the cord so it’s getting more and more frustrating every time I use my computer. If I want to download something, it’ll take an hour. Even just waiting for a site to load has doubled, maybe tripled, in time. I don’t know if it has anything to do with the new routers, but I don’t think it’s a coincidence.”
Students should not only be concerned about the slow connection throughout the dorms. Every student with a wireless router is required to register it with IT, which monitors the registered router to ensure that your Internet is not being stolen, but some students have slipped through the cracks and are, in fact, stealing the Internet that many are paying for.
With easy access to a student’s router comes even easier access to their information. According to stackexchange.com, if someone is able to access your router they are also able to access the information coming and going from your computer. Students living on campus using registered routers should have a password to prevent this from happening.
Eric Palacios, senior Biology major, said, “You don’t really notice the difference. If you have a router, you can get WiFi and everything seems about the same speed. It’s the students who are still using the wires that are having all the problems.”
Both Residents and Commuters Complain
The WiFi throughout the campus has become just as slow as it is in the dorms. Many commuter students need WiFi to look at Blackboard and e-mails throughout the day on a mobile device, but are having trouble being able to access the LIU Post wireless internet.
Nicholas Sesto, a junior Pre-Pharmacy major, said, “In certain buildings I’ll try to connect to the school’s WiFi on my phone and it won’t even give me the option to do so. I’ll try again a few more times before I just give up. Sometimes it’s just easier to go to the library than to sit there on my phone when it isn’t working.”
With the new routers all over the dorm buildings, and with many of them still unprotected, students are at risk. The Internet has become slower, but the privacy of the students has also become a huge problem.
Not Many Assistance Requests
Nancy Marksbury, deputy chief information officer of IT said, “IT made a step-by-step document available that instructs students on the proper configuration of their access points to the office of Residential Life. We are pleasantly surprised by the small number of requests for assistance. Students appear to be able to follow the directions without too much difficulty. Now in the fourth week of classes, we have fielded only a couple of complaints about slowed internet speeds for both the wired and wireless.”
Password Protection
When asked about password protection for the routers, Marksbury said, “In the year 2013, any account left without password protection invites risk! We are confident that with having properly followed instructions provided by Information Technology, students can surf and engage in online activities with confidence. We remain available to assist with questions that may arise, and monitor network activity to ensure a good environment for all.”
Get Help
Students concerned about privacy or how to password protect a router should contact the IT department. Students can also call or walk into the ITRC located in the library, room 222 on Monday-Thursday from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m., or on Friday from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m., to ask any questions regarding routers.

Happiness is a really difficult topic to discuss, mainly because we all achieve happiness in different ways. Fortunately, I realized this right after I sat down to write, so I was able to take a step back from writing.
I had to disconnect myself from my own “happiness factors,” so that I could attempt to create a universal recipe for happiness that can apply to anyone.
Is there such a thing as complete, 100 percent happiness? When was the last time you were truly happy? Are you happy right now? I happen to believe that it is definitely possible to feel completely happy, but I also think that most of us have not experienced such fortune – for long periods of time at least.
There are many questions that I asked myself when it came to interpreting happiness, like “Can you feel stressed and happy at the same time?” If you can feel stressed and happy at the same time, are you truly happy? Could you be happier than you are right now? And if so, how can you reach that point?
Anyway, I looked everywhere for this recipe to happiness, and somehow it all came to me when I found a poem that I wrote in tenth grade. It goes like this:
“Look up to the seemingly boundless sky.
 Treasure its beauty as the clouds pass by.
 Take a look around, breathe in the fresh air. 
Appreciate the breeze that flows through your hair. 
Listen for the inspirational sounds of life.”
And disregard every bit of strife. Embrace the path, in which you lead For it is solely happiness that you need.
After reading this poem, it occurred to me that you know you’re happy when you wake up, go outside, and everything around you appears wonderful: the people, the weather, the architecture, life in general. But how can we create these feelings? It may seem strange to think that you can teach yourself to be happy, but it is definitely possible. You just have to be more aware of yourself. With that said, I came up with a list of things that you can do to be an overall happier person:
Smile often: Not only is it attractive to other people, but studies show that it is possible that smiling can be a cause – rather than an effect – of happiness. Charles Darwin wrote in 1872,“The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it.”
Laugh: Laughter is a powerful antidote to stress, pain, and conflict. A little laughter a day can legitimately keep the doctor away. According to helpguide.org, laughter helps to protect the heart, relax the whole body, boost the immune system, and triggers the release of endorphins, which are the body’s natural feel-good chemicals.
Recognize the little things: By taking note of the little things around you, like smiling at your friends, helpful gestures, politeness, or even just further acknowledging the cute little cats all around campus, you will be happier for it.
Do things that make you happy: Everybody needs some time to himself or herself. By spending a little time each week to do what makes you happy, you are taking time to release the stresses and obstacles that have burdened you throughout the week.
Give Love: Appreciate those around you, and the love that you receive from your friends, family, and significant others. By showing your appreciation and love for those around you, you will not only feel good about yourself, but you will be rewarded with love and appreciation in return.
No matter what stage of happiness you have managed to reach, you can always be happier.
The recipe is simple.

On Oct. 19, the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts hosted the live stage comedy “Hungry Hungry Games” at its concert hall. With the tag line “The funniest show in the district,” the “Hungry Hungry Games” takes on the treasured film franchise rooted in Suzanne Collins’ novel trilogy.
The Tilles Center atrium was teeming with anticipation before the doors to the Concert Hall were officially open for business. Ticket holders comprised mainly of fandom-struck pre-teens and their parents, as well as fandom-struck teenagers. The attendees then filtered into the Concert Hall once the ‘games’ were ready to begin.
The stage was set simply for the show, with only a large scaffolding piece fixed with ladders and platforms sitting center stage.
A haunting fog blanketed the stage as the lights dimmed. Suddenly, rap music blasted through the speakers as the five-person cast made their grand entrance. The low-numbered nature of the cast required the majority of the actors to take on multiple roles. Two actors had seven characters apiece. The whole show followed the same storyline as the original “Hunger Games,” with one striking exception: head writer Jim Millan’s creations nowhere near resembled the franchise characters (save common tells from the trilogy such as Katniss’ bow skills and Peeta’s artistry).
Aside from having polar opposite personalities, the parody characters had different names from those in the book – my personal favorites being Haystacks Abercrombie taking place of Haymitch Abernathy, and Influenza Babygap taking place of Effie Trinket.
The performance poked fun at what was considered to be the norm in “The Hunger Games” franchise. Viewers witnessed President Snoo self-deprecating the ridiculous behaviors of the Capitol citizens, Gabe be- ing completely obvious about his attraction to Kat, and Cable revealing the tragic reality surrounding the trilogy through his sick rhyme during a tribute rap battle.
The show was intriguing and hilariously funny due to the witty writing team and well placed pop culture references – most notably, Miley’s VMA twerk fest. There was much focus on the little parts that made up Collins’ work, such as hilarious banter between game makers and an inside look at the hive of the lethal crackerjack.
One scene that caused rip-roaring laughter among the audience was the introduction of Cinna’s counterpart, Sinner, who the tributes of District 12 believe is Lenny Kravitz (who played Cinna in the film) in the flesh. Another sidesplitting instant was the character Foxface’s foil, Tonka Bookweenis, experiencing “the womanly change” while competing in the arena, ending with her imminent expiration, and a comedic lament about her “transformation.”
Of course the “simmering sexual tension” between Kat and Peter was explored, where every interaction between the characters made you feel like The Hunger Games crossed paths with your run-of-the-the mill teen dramedy. The “star-crossed lovers” are portrayed as just that right off the bat, followed up with wise cracks from Haystacks and fellow tributes. Picture “High School Musical” with less singing and more killing.
Overall, Millan’s brainchild tickled the funny bone of the viewers. The intimate, highly talented cast showed some serious comedy chops, and the little use of props required a reliance on improving the script and using sound effects, which dismissed sticking to the usual majesty of live stage production. Millan directed his witty script with relaxed professionalism, utilizing little-known names packed with star-quality skill. “The Hungry Hungry Games” will continue their nationwide tour until early May, making stops at other well-known venues along the way.

As the AMC’s “The Walking Dead” gains popularity, more and more people have become interested in zombies and the idea of a zombie apocalypse.
Venues in New York City held several zombie-related events this year. There was the 5K “Run for Your Lives” zombie run, held this past summer, with another held in Brooklyn on Oct. 26 at Floyd Bennet Field. Then there was Zombie-Con, a bar crawl in New York City, where attendees dressed as zombies. Zombie-Con was held on the weekend of Oct. 12 , also the date of “The Walking Dead Escape.”
“The Walking Dead Escape” was held on the Intrepid, an air, space, and sea museum, originally an aircraft carrier, at Pier 84. The event was one night that ran from 7:15 p.m. until about midnight. Fans were sent in waves about every 15 minutes to make sure that there weren’t too many “survivors” in one part of the course. The average group took about 30-40 minutes to complete the obstacle course, based on main events in the show, such as when Rick, who is a very significant character, woke up in an abandoned hospital. It also featured military bases that were taken over by walkers.
Fans had the option to be either a zombie or survivor for “The Walking Dead Escape.” Tickets to be a survivor ranged from $65-$85, with the zombie option ranging from $85-$90. Those who chose to be walkers, as they are called in the show, were required to arrive two hours prior to the wave time to get their make-up professionally done.
If I hadn’t known that it was just make-up, I would have thought they were zombies. That is how good the make-up was. I was a survivor and, even though at some points it was scary when the zombies popped out of nowhere, it was really a fun experience. At some points throughout the course I couldn’t stop laughing because the people that volunteered to be zombies got so into it and looked at you with such blank stares just as they do in the show.
Attendees started in a staged evacuation zone, where military officials said there was a virus outbreak in New York City. Then, the survivors went through what appeared to be the hospital that Rick woke up in during the first episode of the TV series, and from there climbed through school buses, and crawled under other obstacles. Before attendees could get to the water station, they first had to make it to the top of the ship. Since this was an obstacle course and not a race, survivors were allowed to continue to the end of the course regardless of whether they had been touched or caught by a walker.
At the end of the course attendees had to enter a military tent and were scanned with a black light to see if they caught the virus. If cleared, they were sent to the right to continue through, and if they had the virus, were sent to the left and put a red dot on their forehead to indicate being fictionally shot before inevitably turning into a zombie.
This was a one-night event, strategically planned to be the night before “The Walking Dead” season four premiere. It has not been announced yet if they plan on bringing the event back next year, but when looking at their Facebook page, it is easy to see that many who went this year had an amazing time. Event goers do have to be 18 or older to register, unless they have permission from a parent or guardian. If you want to see pictures of the obstacle course you can visit www.TheWalkingDeadEscape.com, which also has links to its Facebook page and Twitter account.

The men’s soccer team remains undefeated after a pair of victories over the Molloy College Lions and the Saint Thomas Aquinas College (STAC) Spartans last week, bringing their record to 14-0.
The Pioneers is currently ranked as the best men’s soccer team in the country, as they hold the number one spot in the NCAA DII National ranking for the third straight week.
The Pioneers hosted the Lions on Wednesday, Oct. 16. Molloy was quick to start, scoring the first goal just over a minute into the game. Over 70 minutes of suspenseful game play kept the Pioneer fans biting their nails on the edge of the bleachers.
With less than 20 minutes left in the game, junior forward Eivind Austboe evened the score with help from an assist by freshman forward Johann Kristjansson. Ten minutes later, Austboe secured the win with a second goal off an assist by freshman back Johannes Forgaard. The less than 10 minutes that remained on the clock weren’t enough for the Lions to come back. Post won the match, 2-1.
The Pioneers then traveled to Sparkill, N.Y. to take on the Spartans on Saturday, Oct. 19. The Pioneers’ senior midfielder Jonathon Watkin was first to score off an assist by Austboe, just over ten minutes into the game. A second Pioneer goal came shortly after by sophomore midfielder Matias Ruiz, off an assist by sophomore midfielder Per Forgaard.
With less than five minutes in the first half, Austboe scored the third Pioneer goal off a free kick. The Spartans finally got on the board with their first goal less than halfway through the second half. Their efforts weren’t enough. Ruiz and junior midfielder Vincent Tavernese each scored goals in the second half off assists by graduate midfielder Tom Bowen and Kristjansson. The Pioneers brought home the win, 5-1.
The Pioneers travel to Waterbury, Conn. on Wednesday, Oct. 23 to take on the nationally ninth ranked Post University Eagles, and then host the Mercy College Mavericks on Saturday, Oct. 26 at 2:30 p.m.

The LIU Post women’s soccer team has managed to keep their good start going, and are now holding a 10-4 overall record, while being 4-2 in the East Coast Conference. It will be a close race to secure one of three available playoff spots.
On Thursday, Oct. 17 the Pioneers took on Holy Family University at home at Roberts Blitz field in Brookville, New York. The game
was only one minute old, when senior forward Jeanine Ambrogi put the green and gold on the board with a shot from the top of the 18-yard box. Ambrogi’s goal proved to be the only goal of the half, but senior forward Alexa Niciforo only used 11 minutes of the second half to double the lead. The Pioneers managed to ride the game out, and secure an important 2-0 win.
Looking at the ECC standings, Bridgeport University seems to be unstoppable, and has won all of their first seven ECC games, but behind the Purple Knights it is wide open. LIU Post alongside Mercy, Roberts Wesleyan, Queens and Dowling are all in a position to make the conference playoffs. The Pioneers took another step towards making a post- season appearance when they dominated St. Thomas Aquinas College 6-1 on Saturday, Oct. 19.
Six different players found the back of the net in the win, while junior back Lauren Bellone had a standout performance, tallying two assists for the night. But it was Niciforo who started off the scoring bonanza when she found the back of the net after 14 minutes.
After that point the goals kept coming. Freshmen midfielders Katie Kingston and Sarah McGarry both added a tally each, and sophomore forward Susanne Vistnes added her eighth goal of the year 62 minutes into the contest. Vistnes now looks forward to the season’s last four games, and is excited about the position the Pioneers are in. “We obviously wish we had won a couple of more games, but we still have the opportunity to decide our own destiny,” Vistnes said.
The first chance the Pioneers have to gain momentum towards playoffs is to beat Wilmington University on the road on Tuesday, Oct. 22, before hosting Mercy College for their senior day on Saturday, Oct 26.
