The first semester back at school is always hectic.  We are forced to recover from a long summer of sun-drenched skin, salty hair and the searing hot excitement for absolutely no schoolwork (not to mention one too many vodka seltzers).  Whether you’re a new incoming student or a veteran senior, the first couple of weeks feel as though you’re running on zero steam; you’re just chugging along completely off balance, trying to find your way in our little community here at Post.
As the third week rolls on by, we just need to take a deep breath.  Most of us approach things at a different pace, some of you might even be completely settled already, but for those of us that aren’t it is important to take each day as it comes. And don’t worry, that everyday routine and easiness will come with time.  Still don’t believe us?  Check out our article on time management.  One of our staff writers gives you a play by play on how to start off the semester right.  Also, another writer discusses the alcohol policy on campus; do you agree with it or not?
Our features section is once again packed with nutritional information and even a profile on the Newman club at Post.  As usual, we ended this issue with many sports updates.  We would also like to apologize for not printing one article last week that discussed the men’s soccer team.  However, this week there are two full stories about the team and how they are coming along this year.
Until next week, enjoy kids!

The C.W. Post Center for Student Information in Hillwood Commons began distributing iPads at 9 a.m. on Thursday September 23.  Freshmen and transfer students lined up to receive their new computing devices with a collection of mixed reviews.
The iPad project, which was initially announced this summer, is aimed to give students access to resources and services anywhere from in their classrooms to any Wi-Fi hotspot. Long Island University has been updating its wireless infrastructure, which has included a high-speed, fiber-optic network, new online programs, and industry leading Web learning software.
Even though the iPad is just one example of a technological enhancement that is supposed to offer convenience and portability, freshman and public relations major Caroline Tabibian has yet to find a use for her iPad when she has a Macbook that offers similar services. “I was kind of mad when they announced we were getting iPads,” Tabibian said.  “I wouldn’t have bought my laptop.”
New students without the accessibility to their own laptops may find it easier to connect with classmates, professors and other staff on campus; take notes in class without lugging a laptop; organize daily assignments and activities; access information at a more accelerated pace and buy textbooks.  “From now on I can download textbooks, instead of buying them and spending money,” freshman and Childhood Education major Kelly Ahearn said.
Professors are allegedly using this new development in education to move more coursework online and into classrooms. “With a few easy swipes on an iPad screen, it would be possible to get students to do things that would be hard for them to otherwise do,” Dr. Arvind Borde, a senior professor of mathematics said. “They can study mathematical behavior graphically by plotting (with ease) two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphs. They can do calculations. They can explore the uses of mathematics via the Internet.”
However, it seems as though not all professors are complying with the new iPad trend.  “I don’t think it’s really going to benefit me that much with school,” freshman Talia Nitka said.  “None of my teachers give assignments on it or say that we are going to need it for anything.”  Even accounting major Nina Reily is having trouble finding use for her new iPad.  “I can’t see myself using it that much in class.”
C.W. Post Provost Dr. Paul Forestell believes the iPad project will be an enhancement to education.  “The wireless device will allow students and faculty to more efficiently and effectively collaborate on the process of learning,” Forestell said.   Only time will tell if this new development will be as effective as administrators and professors believe it to be.

C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University recently suffered a great loss when the life of Professor Paul Gordon was tragically cut short after an automobile accident that took place on the afternoon of Tuesday September 14. He was 65.
Gordon was a resident of Jericho, N.Y. and had been teaching at C.W. Post since 2004 as an adjunct professor in the College of Education and Information Sciences. Steven Silverman, a fellow adjunct professor of Computer and Information Sciences, was a friend of Gordon for 25 years and distinctly recollects the unique qualities Gordon exhibited as a person.
“I was shocked,” said Silverman, “There were about 600-800 people from all over the country that came to his funeral; everybody had a story to tell about him.”
In addition, Prof. Silverman fondly remembers the rare and special relationship Prof. Gordon shared with his students. He did things that you’d think only parents did.  Silverman solidifies that Gordon was a big believer in education when he mentioned how Gordon was there for his pupils.
“Paul flew to South Dakota to see one his students graduate,” said Silverman.  Professor Gordon was very active. He taught chemistry and biology, rode a motorcycle and coached baseball.
“Paul loved teaching at Post,” said Silverman. “He enjoyed helping others and made everyone want to be all they could be. He was made to be a teacher. He was my friend.”
Paul had a large family but no children. “The students were his children and he treated them as such,” Silverman said. A scholarship will be set up in memory of Gordon by his spouse in the Syosset school district.

Post mourns the passing of an innovative and legendary member of campus community
By: Kayla Krause
Editor-in-Chief
 
A CW Post legend and honorary man recently passed away.  Julian Mates, the founding dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts, was a brilliant man and scholar.  He was not only the first dean of Post’s art school, but also an English professor at the university.
Mates certainly left his mark here at CW Post. He will be remembered for founding many events at C.W. Post.  He started the American Theatre Festival, which is an event held each year by the Post Theatre Company.  In collaboration with composer Stefan Wolpe, they composed the campus alma mater “When Evening Falls.”
Not only did he impact the university, but his students and even faculty say his teaching techniques left a lasting impression on them.  Kay Hutchins Sato, an assistant provost to the Hutton House Lectures, was quoted in Newsday saying that, “If he were reading ‘Hamlet,’ you’d believe you were watching it on stage.”
Barbara Fowles, current chairwoman of the Media Arts Department and professor at Post, is Mates’ wife.  Mates also had three children, two daughters; Jessica and Karen, one son; Ethan; and three grandchildren.
On October 10, 2010 at 11a.m. there will be a memorial service for Julian Mates.  It will be at the Interfaith Center on C.W. Post’s campus.

Student success – that was the topic of the Welcome Convocation hosted by Provost Dr. Paul Forestell, on September 22nd.  This was an opportunity for students and faculty at C.W. Post to be brought together, and hear about what the goals of this year are.
The Convocation began with an introduction to the schools newest additions and improvements that were specifically made to enhance communication between students and faculty. We were notified that there are now several flat screen T.V.’s scattered throughout the buildings that will display important information. There is also a revamped radio station, Ipad project, and television center. Paul Forestell was speaking for himself as well as all of his colleagues when he said, “Success rewarded, develops and grows, and the biggest reward is your degree.”
Our fellow classmates produced a video entitled, “What Success Means to You.” The video was their view on what success means, and showed that with the help of each other we can achieve success at C.W. Post. To help the students reach their highest potential, there is a new division of staff that has only one focus and that is, student success. Students are welcomed and encouraged to take advantage of this new division.
David Steinberg, President of C.W. Post Campus, gave a short speech, speaking of Middle States, an organization that accredits numerous colleges and universities, as well as promotes educational excellence. He mentioned how when they come to inspect our school they will not only want to know what we do, but how we do it and prove that it works.
We were then introduced to two students who are the ideal picture of what student success is. They spoke about how C.W. Post got them to where they are today. Coach Collins and Professor Cheryl Halliburton-Beatty introduced Andrew Jackson, a football player, and Rochelle Martin, a ballet dancer. The audience was shown a brief video to see that success is a combination of hard work, effort and fun.
Our orientation leaders ended the Convocation with a song and dance they performed about life at C.W. Post. Following the performance, the raffle winners were announced and claimed their prizes. We were then escorted outside the room where they provided refreshments. Convocation 2010 definitely proved to be a lesson on achieving success here at Post, and now it’s up to the student body to make their futures as successful as possible with the new additions.

Thanks to all of you for jumping on board the Pioneer’s nutritional guide. From last weeks introductory article, I hope you all became familiar with the basics of nutrition and how to leap straight into a healthy regime –dieting and exercising being the two main components. Assuming you all had checked out MyPyramid.gov and created your own personalized daily diet, you are now aware of what foods are best suited for your unique body. Now is the time to really get started and take full advantage of the tips and advice listed in this week’s column Enjoy!
 
First things first: stop skipping breakfast. Nutritionist from all around the world emphasize the importance of having breakfast. A well-balanced breakfast gives your body a nutritional boost to start the day with the energy and stability needed to function properly. By skipping breakfast, your hunger only increases mid-day –leading one to indulge in a fatty snack and/or high calorie lunch.
Attention! Food labels aren’t all what they claim to be. According to the Ghri Nutrition Director Samantha B. Cassetty, M.S., R.D., shoppers must be skeptical of the promises food labels make.  Here are the three “claims” she warns us to be weary of:
“Contains fiber”: This is usually advertised on snack bars, breakfast pastries, and artificial sweeteners. What Cassetty warns us is that these foods are usually fortified with isolated fibers —fibers that do not necessarily offer the same health benefits as the naturally occurring fibers found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans. Get your fiber naturally, not artificially. 
“Made With Whole Grains”: This is another claim we are warned to be skeptical of. “Misleading ‘multigrain’ signals a blend of whole and refined grains. Check the ingredient list and make sure it starts with “whole ___,” with the blank being a grain (like wheat or rye),” Cassety states.
“Has Real Fruit”: Cassetty also warns us that when we find a granola bar with fruit filling, it is NOT real fruit. It is usually an artificial fruit flavoring with an abundance of sugar –missing the array of nutrients and fiber you would get from a simple whole fruit. 
 
Proof! For those who still have no faith in the ability to eat healthy on campus, here are three examples of nutritional and easy meals available to make at both the Winnick and Hillwood Cafe:
Breakfast: one slice of whole grain bread with a teaspoon of peanut butter; low fat yogurt; side of fruit.
Lunch: One scoop of either tuna or chicken salad mixed with your choice of vegetables from the salad bar, all mixed together on a whole-wheat wrap.
Dinner: Salad of your choice with grilled chicken cut on top; vegetable or soup on side.
Dessert: Two apple’s cut and warmed in microwave with honey and cinnamon on top.
Weight loss: For those concerned with weight loss, Cornell University researchers found that one’s surroundings make a world of difference. After surveying 200 dieters, researchers found “that those who altered their environment while chowing down –using smaller bowls and plates, turning off the TV –stuck to their diet for about two more days per month than subjects who tried to change what they ate (more fruit, for example) or their dining habits,” writes Good Health Magazine in their newest October 2010 issue. “Making one big decision –like replacing large dinner plates with smaller ones –is easier than trying to resist temptation every single time you eat a meal.”
Trick-not-treat. As the Halloween season draws near, the temptation of candy is everywhere. It is almost impossible to resist a bowl of candy as you walk into a department or classroom on campus –until we realize how many calories exist in each little treat. However, when we are aware of the calorie content, research proves that we are less likely to indulge. Here is a list of the calorie content in some of the most popular Halloween candies, along with how many minutes it would take to walk each off!
 
 
 
Snickers Miniature: 40 cals, 17 minutes.
Tootsie Roll Mini: 23 cals, 10 minutes.
York Peppermint Pattie Mini: 50 cals, 21 minutes.
Candy Corn mini pack: 50 cals, 21 minutes.
Skittles Fun Size: 60 cals, 25 minutes.
M&M’s Fun Size: 70 cals, 29 minutes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Halloween is not only a time for sweets, but a time for costumes. We all know how much pressure it is to not only come up with a creative costume, but to look good in it as well. One month until the big weekend out, and now is a perfect time to start getting toned.  Hopefully you all checked out the exercise classes given at the Pratt Recreation Center here on campus, but if not, here are some basic tips to do by yourself in the Pratt gym.
Aim for 30 minutes of cardio a day: running, swimming, biking, and/or jump romping. Cardio speeds up heart rate and burns calories fast.
Add weights. Most women are afraid to lift in fear of bulking up or gaining too much muscle, but low weights and higher reps are perfect for getting lean and toned. Men, continue to lift and remember to alternate areas of you body; one day concentrate on arms, legs, back, etc., and never over do it.
Add variety to your routine. Challenge your body with different work outs, intensities and movements. Doing the same routine leads to muscle memory –allowing your muscle to get use to the movements, causing them to no longer be challenged.
Take these tips into consideration this week and please do not give up. Continue to work hard everyday and be more cautious of what you put in your body. Remember to utilize what the campus has to offer by taking full advantage of the Pratt Recreation. If you are more of an outdoors person, take a jog around the football field or take a train ride down to Long Beach and run the beautiful coastline while the weather is still warm!
Until next time, have a happy and healthy week.

Last week at the campus Chapel, the Newman club hosted their annual event, “International Friendship Night.” The president of the organization, Becky Wetzel, confidently led the occasion. The night involved several ice-breaker activities that brought the Newman club members closer to the participating international students. The purpose of the event was to warmly welcome the new international students, mingle with them, and most importantly, introduce them to the Newman club.
The Newman Catholic Community was one of the first clubs here at Post. It was established in 1955 and their values of hospitality, involvement, openness, friendship, and faith haven’t changed. The only difference this year is the expansion of the organization. There are three new societies under Newman: Newman Ultimate Frisbee Society (NUFS), a group that plays Frisbee and other games during common hour and on weekends, the Newman New Media Society, which will be producing a bi-weekly video on various topics, and the Newman Art Society, a group that will hold discussions and creative art forums. These additions are helping to accomplish Wetzel’s goal of being more active on campus. “[We want] to become more visible on campus and to find out students’ needs,” said Wetzel. “So that we can carry out programs that benefit everyone.”
Wetzel‘s other goal this semester is to co-sponsor as many clubs on campus as she can. She finds that co-sponsorship is a useful method in promoting an organization’s message. For example, Wetzel is hoping to have more co-sponsors to aid Newman with their biggest event this 2010: Homeless Awareness Week. Throughout the first week of November, the clubs that will be active in the event will help Newman cooperate with The Interfaith Nutrition Network (INN) to aid the homeless youth.
Lastly, Wetzel aims to get more students involved with the Newman club because according to Wetzel, it’s not just an organization, it’s an experience. “I have seen people change through being in Newman; it simply is a place where you can be yourself and find life-long friends,” said Wetzel. “I think one of our community’s main assets is its ability to empower individuals to be themselves and make a difference in this world.”
The Newman Club meets every Wednesday at 7pm at the Chapel.

According to the Chicago Tribune, a family of a deceased college student filed a lawsuit against Wabash College in Indiana last week. The young student was found dead after a fraternity party in 2008. His family holds the college partially responsible, arguing that the institution’s alcohol policy contributed to the death of their son. Wabash applied what it called a “Gentlemen’s Rule,” which the attorney of the family describes as “vague and ineffective.”  While this case has yet to unfold, the point of who holds the responsibility for the young man’s death may be argued infinitely.
C.W. Post receives its share of criticism for its alcohol policy, albeit, in the other direction. Students often complain that the rules here are excessively rigorous and that they should be reviewed. Yet, if C.W. Post’s administration wants to avoid the mess that Wabash is in, it may be wise to await a federal change of the alcohol laws. Until then, however, there are some peculiarities in our college’s alcohol policy that are worthy of debate.
One notion the Residence Life staff at this school perpetuates is that students over 21 years of age may not have alcohol in their room if their roommates are not of drinking age. To investigate this, I referred to the Student Handbook 09-10. Here is the rule on the matter: “Persons over 21 may possess alcoholic beverages in moderate amounts (see “c” below) in their individual residence hall rooms or suites…” Notice that it says “individual,” it does not mention if the presence of an under-age roommate changes the circumstances.  Since single rooms are not available to the general population at C.W. Post, and the schools reserves the right to pair students with whomever it decides, one could assume that the right to possess alcohol remains for a person of age regardless of the roommate’s age.
There are two points in possible reservation of this. The first: “No person under 21 may acquire, possess, consume or be in the presence of any alcoholic beverage on the Campus.”  The hazy language of this rule should confirm our interpretation of the previous rule rather than contradict it. To “be in presence” of an “alcoholic beverage on campus” leaves us to wonder what that exactly constitutes. Is it in the same room? The same facility? The vicinity to alcohol seems irrelevant as long as it is not consumed in the presence of a person below 21.
The second point is referred to as “c” in the initial citation, which describes the allowed amount of alcohol as “no more than one or two people can reasonably and responsibly consume during a specified period of time.” Again the language is quite vague. Let us however try to define this amount.  For instance, one should “reasonably” be allowed to possess a bottle of liquor. Even though two people can hardly consume “responsibly,” it should be understood that generally people do not intend to drink a bottle of hard liquor in one intensive session.
According to a generic blood alcohol content calculator, a person of 170 pounds, who is a frequent drinker, and drinks 12 beers over 8 hours would have an estimated B.A.C. of 0.097 percent. A study at Virginia Tech describes the symptoms of intoxication at this level as moderate. Judging from this, we may infer that an individual of legal age should be allowed to store 24 cans of beer.
Interestingly enough, some schools have specified the amount of alcohol students are allowed to keep to avoid misunderstandings. For example, Iona College allows its students of age to keep a bottle of hard liquor or a maximum of 30 cans of beer in their room. Even more interesting is the fact that C.W. Post’s rules are so unclear. Even though we have established some theoretical guidelines, any Residence Life staff could claim these our wrong and explain what the rules “really say.”
Reportedly, the right of interpretation spans as far as to authorize the staff to fine students simply for having empty cans of beer in their trash.
There are even unofficial rules in existence only the Residence Life staff knows about. These rules apparently state that Residence Life staff may order students to pour out any alcohol in their possession. Meanwhile, the Student Handbook only says that illegal substances may be confiscated and not returned. This may appear a marginal difference, but one feels quite violated when staff commands you to pour out 30 cans of unopened beer by hand.
The federal laws on alcohol have their own flaws. A few years ago, 120 college presidents signed the Amethyst Initiative, calling for a review of this country’s alcohol laws. The president of our university was not among these, and maybe this is too much to hope for. Yet, I would think that college, founded on liberal beliefs, should at the very least not perpetuate an environment where rules are so vague that students, in every corner, are subject to the authority’s own interpretation of the rules.
The elite colleges aspire to be meritocracies according to Greek philosophic tradition. At C.W. Post, we appear to strive towards an autocracy, where the police make their own laws.

As college students we do not have it as easy as many people believe, sure we haven’t entered the work force full time yet, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t working. School itself is more like a full time job and it can take its’ toll, putting a strain on the body and on the mind.
The easiest solution would be to cut out work and focus on school. For most of us this is impossible, so the key to this balancing act is time management.
The first step in managing time is to plan the time you have. Get a planner or use your blackberry or iPhone to organize your assignments, instead of writing on a piece of paper ripped out of your notebook. Write down what you need to accomplish everyday and what you need to accomplish long-term.  Surely there’s some kind of “app” you can find for that.
Looking at what you have to do and how long you have to accomplish it will help put your time in perspective. Writing your work schedule in your planner will also help manage the time you need to be at work and the time you have for homework.
If you have a paper due in a month make a timeline, set goals of what you want to accomplish each week. It is possible to write a good paper the day before, but only if you do some of the work in advance.
Use the supplies around you to help give you friendly reminders.  Post-its, poster boards, or calendars are decent tools to surround your work area with “to-do” lists.  Plus, the feeling of crossing off an assignment is one of the best feelings in the world.
Studying can be another difficult task, and that has a great deal to do with where this studying takes place. If you get distracted easily, plan for this, tell yourself I am going to focus for 30 minutes and then I can have a ten-minute break.
During your break you can give into distraction and look at your phone or facebook, but then get right back to studying. This break will allow your brain to get rest it will not become fatigued so quickly, and you will actually get more studying done.
Spare time can be rare when you are balancing work and school. When you do have that extra time it is tempting to spend it with friends or watching TV, you do not have to devote all your spare time to school. However there are some down times that are perfect for getting some schoolwork done.
If you get to school early sit in your car and take some time to look over that reading you had over the weekend, or do a last minute read of your notes before a quiz or test. If you get a lunch break at work that could be a good time to do some reading or studying. Doing work during these times can leave you with free time later on to enjoy.
Procrastination can be your worst enemy; so do not let it get to you. If you must procrastinate make sure it is a small assignment that can be done correctly and quickly.
Working and going to school does not have to be stressful, making good use of your time and understanding the way you study and the way you work can help you make the most of the time you have. On that note, good luck this semester guys!

Dear Samantha and Kayla,
I know it has been a very  frustrating beginning  and I appreciate all of your hard work with organizing the pieces to make it all happen.  You have a lot of support and guidance with Ms. Levin as your faculty advisor.  She has been your biggest ally in making sure we have  rectified some of the deplorable  conditions you were faced with.   I know we need to do some more work in the office and I would appreciate your keeping us on task.
 
I just read the first issue and you two have done a great job.  The layout is good, the news editor and the opinions editor have presented very clear and balanced  reporting.  Your sports and staff writers have also  represented well our Athletic teams.  I was excited to see the level of organization and the number of staff you have put to work in such a short period of time.
 
I wish you both a very successful semester and you are off to a great start considering what you were faced with upon accepting your roles.
 
The new face of the Pioneer is very exciting!
 
All my best,
 
-Amy Urquhart
Assistant Provost for Student Affairs

Post’s Healthcare Debate: It’s Not Rocket Science

 
 


First, you wasted your introduction with your crappy analogy to our own healthcare system. We don’t have universal health care and this country is never going to be socialistic. There is no threat of socialism and quite frankly you need to stop obsessing over it. It’s people like you that will never allow socialism to “plague” our country. I remember you in my POL 304 class and you used to annoy me when we were studying Marx. Plus, socialism has worked out great in other countries and so has universal health care. Nonetheless, this is not about America’s health care system; this is about our problem with the doctor only being here a couple hours out of the week.
There is a nurse always here. For most of our minor medical problems, this is the pretty much the only person we need to see. Here is a personal story. On the way to one of my classes, I rode a Razor scooter down Chipmunk Trail, picked up speed at the end of the hill, flipped over the front of the handlebars, and scraped up my elbow pretty much to the point where you could see the bone. Do I go to class bleeding or do I go to the infirmary? I think the choice is obvious. Point is that if you are sick enough or hurt enough that you must see a doctor, then you should be missing class anyway. There is no argument there. If you got the flu, the nurse will give you medication and suggest to set an appointment with the doctor when he is here. Might I remind you that the doctor that works here is the director of the hospital down the road from the school and he volunteers here.
We’re not going to charge students for an around-the-clock doctor. If you get deathly ill in the middle of the night, you simply call Public Safety, the EMT’s come and put you in the ambulance, and they transport you to the hospital 2 minutes down Northern Boulevard. It’s not Rocket Science bro.

Off to a slow start this season the C.W. Post Men’s Soccer team is looking to bounce back from their current 1-3-1 record this week with two games on the road against teams with losing records.
Overall, Coach Lindberg isn’t happy with the start but is expecting to rebound. “The team has played very well at certain times during the year,” said Lindberg, the 2009 East Coast Conference Coach of the Year. “But we’ve struggled as well.”
Lindberg, in his second year coaching at C.W. Post, has already noticed improvement from several players on his squad including graduate goalkeeper, Ed Shone and sophomore back, Chris Leaver. “Both players have stepped up in the spring and have shown they can play at a high level,” said Lindberg. The coach awarded their efforts by naming them both captain this season mostly because of their ability to lead.
The Pioneers have been looking for consistency in their offense, and might have found it in senior forwards Rumen Kerekov, who leads the team in goals and William Lindberg, who has missed two games due to injury yet is the only player with both a goal and an assist.
The goal this year is simple; defend the East Coast Conference Championship they won last year, however, injuries can make it tough to repeat their success. Lindberg has already missed action to begin the season now sophomore back Leron Haywood will miss some time as well. “He [Haywood] got an MRI taken and he’ll be out for at least two weeks,” said Lindberg. “But possibly even the rest of the season.” Haywood was named the MVP in the ECC Tournament just a year ago.
In their last game, C.W. Post went up against Millersville University (3-1-1) on the road and finished in a 0-0 draw in double overtime. Ed Shone had an outstanding game in goal saving four shots and keeping Millersville off the scoreboard.
The Pioneers next match-up will be on Wednesday Sept. 22 on the road against American International College (1-4-1) finishing off the week Saturday at NYIT.

Women’s field hockey suffers tough Loss, leaves bitter taste
By: Heather Norris
Staff Writer 
The CW Post field hockey team came back from their western Pennsylvania road trip with both a win and a loss bringing their record to 5-2 overall, and 1-2 in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference.
Considered the most competitive conference in Division II, counting 7 of the top 10 teams in the nation among its members, Post ranks fifth.
In their first game of the trip on Saturday against the Lakers of Mercyhurst College, freshman forward Carlee Dragon was able to put a goal on the board for Post, putting the Pioneers up 1-0 after the first fifteen minutes went scoreless.  The score remained the same until the final 10 minutes were left to play. Senior forward Amanda Nann stole the ball away from a Laker defender and dodged around the goalie to tally her 9th goal of the season.  Four minutes later Post scored again this time from sophomore forward Mia Paltrineri, solidifying Post’s 3-0 win.
Sunday, however, the Pioneers would not be so lucky.  What should have been an easy game for Post turned into berating by the Rock of Slippery Rock University, a team without a ranking in Division II.  Nann was able to net a single goal for the Pioneers and prevent the shutout, but Slipper Rock scored 4 goals in the first half to beat the Pioneers 4-1 to earn their first win of the season.
The Pioneers desperately need a win and they’ll get their chance this Saturday at home against 7th-ranked Kutztown University. The game starts at 2pm on Hickox Field.

Men’s soccer makes a comeback
By: David Otero
Staff Writer
Regulation time could not hold C.W. Post Men’s soccer team. After three consecutive double overtime matches, the team now holds a 2-4-1 record and are undefeated in East Coast Conference play.
The September 18th game against Millersville University ended in a scoreless tie after two overtime periods. Their next game against American International College on September 22nd also ended in double overtime but not even goals from Joakim Ohlson and Rumen Kerekov could hold the lead as AIC took the game with seven minutes remaining.
“We had a tough beginning,” stated Kerkov. “We started with a couple of losses. Since then everybody has worked hard to get out of this situation and from my point of view the team is now on the right track.”
And it showed. Going into their next game versus East Coast Conference rival NYIT, the Pioneers knew it was a big game and they needed to come away with a win. “We are taking one game at a time,” said senior forward Rumen Kerekov. “But our next game is against NYIT and we need to win it at all costs.”
In their first ECC game of the year, C.W. Post got off to a quick start as freshman back Joakim Ohlson scored a goal early in the first period with the assist coming from junior forward Niclas Dahlin. Trailing by one and with only few minutes remaining in the game, sophomore forward Betim Bajrami received a pass from Ohlson that tied the game at two.
After the first overtime session went scoreless, Bajrami ended the game by hitting the back of the net off a breakaway, handing C.W. Post the dramatic 3-2 double OT victory.
“We had to win this game in order to preserve any chances for NCAA,” said Kerekov. “We dominated the game completely, but we were down 1-2 until the 88th minute. Then we were able to tie the game and eventually we won in overtime. It was a great battle, we played very well and we deserved to win.”
After four successive road games, the Pioneers are finally back home to take on Saint Anselm College who is 1-5-1 for the year (1-3-1 ECC). C.W. Post’s has only played one game at home, which they won 2-0.
This week’s schedule has in-conference games against rivals University of Bridgeport (4-3) and Dowling College (4-1-2). Goalkeeper and Captain Ed Shone said the mission remains the same, back to back ECC titles and an NCAA bid, something Men’s Soccer has never done. “Since we are ranked number one in the ECC, everyone is out to beat us,” explained Shone. “If everyone can have the same collective goal, and work as hard as they can towards it, then results and performances will follow.”

Before the Pioneers battled with Shippensburg last Saturday, I could pinpoint the team’s problems but could not reach the solutions.  Eric Anderwkavich was turning the ball over left and right. Thomas Beverly did not look as explosive as he did in his freshman year. The talented defense was giving up over 200 yards rushing like it was the thing to do. And the special teams committed errors repeatedly.
Sure the solutions to those issues seem straightforward. A player could take time to look over reads, play under control or he could just play tougher. But after these issues came up in Week 2 against California (PA.), they were resurrected in Week 3’s game with Mercyhurst.
So how does a coach get a group of panicking, floundering players to reach these solutions?
He shaves.
Nope, I’m not joking. In my weekly sit down with Pioneers Head Coach Bryan Collins, I posed one of my slick, smile-cracking questions. Little did I know I would get one of the most telling answers of the week.
“I’ve never had facial hair in my life,” explained Collins. “I forgot who I was. So I cut it off and told the team to remember who we are.”
An identity issue! That’s the bridge to the solutions. And Collins played it perfectly.
Instead of verbally accosting the players, or putting them through longer practices, Collins was able to get the improvement without making the players feel like it was a punishment. With that mindset, the players focused on their true identity coming into the year. They were once again a favorite in the PSAC, rather than a letdown. And the changes were obvious.
Anderwkavich was able to lead the team effectively, accounting for three of the team’s four touchdowns. Thomas Beverly ripped off several impressive runs, including a 50-yard rumble and a 21-yard touchdown. The defense only allowed 136 rushing yards. And while Paul Stoltz missed a field goal, there were no blocked kicks, missed assignments or fumbles on special teams.
The 31-14 win over the Red Raiders marked the Pioneers’ return to the dominant squad they originally thought they were. And it’s all because Coach Bryan Collins decided to take a Bic razor to his face. It’s little, spontaneous acts like this that can be a catalyst for a team during the season. Many professional athletes tempt fate with crazy superstitions, in the end its all apart of the game.

Pioneers’ 31-14 Victory Ends Losing Streak
By: Matthew Saur
Staff Writer
The Pioneers snapped a two game losing streak along with picking up their first PSAC East division win in a 31-14 victory over the Shippensburg University Raiders in Pennsylvania.
The game’s first quarter started with both defenses playing tight and getting the best of the offense. Pioneer linebacker Ronnie Modik intercepted a throw by Raiders quarterback Steve Adams at the Pioneers nine yard line to break up a possible Raiders score. Following the interception the Post offense marched down the field but left with the score still at zero after a missed 30-yard field goal.
It took until 3:06 in the second quarter for the Pioneers to finally get on the board scoring a touchdown when quarterback Erik Anderwkavich found an open Darnell Williams for the 21-yard score to give the Pioneers a 7-0 lead. The Pioneers lead would dwindle as the Raiders drove right back down the field and scored with 2:29 left in the first half. With the way both teams were playing it looked as if they would go into the half tied. But after a handoff to Post running back Thomas Beverly that all changed when his 50-yard was good enough to put the Pioneers back on top by seven by the end of the half.
The Raiders would tie the score at 7:49 following an eight play 51-yard drive that ended with a Kevin Marshall rushing touchdown. The Pioneers would respond with their own drive that went for 62 yards and a score again putting Post in the lead. Anderwkavich once again found Williams in the end zone for a four-yard touchdown; the Pioneers never looked back after this drive.
After stopping Shippensburg’s offensive drive, Post had another long drive that ended in a 32-yard field goal to add to the lead.
Solidifying the victory was the Pioneer defense in the second half. Sophmore defensive back Ciwan McCoy intercepted a pass late in the fourth that would lead to Anderwkavich icing the game, running it himself for a one-yard score. Linebacker Billy O’Connor again led the Pioneers in tackles with nine while senior defensive end Xavier Brown recorded two sacks for a loss of 14 yards along with junior Abrom Shepard who recorded one for a loss of seven.
The Pioneers offense once again gained over 400 yards, which included 258 yards on the ground from Beverly, Anderwkvach and Anthony Brunetti who all rushed for over 75 yards.
The Pioneers look to build on this win next week when they travel to West.
