LIU Post students can now grab a bite to eat while watching sports in the newly remodeled Pioneer Room in Hillwood. The Pioneer room was remodeled into a sports bar with nine flat-screen TVs.
The grand opening of the End Zone was on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 2 and was sponsored by the Student Government Association (SGA). Many students attended the party to watch the game and enjoy free food and drinks.
Tamir Dayya, Special Projects coordinator, was busy a week before the currently unnamed sports bar’s grand opening. Dayya, a university employee, oversees all of the student run businesses. “We are trying to give students a late night campus option where they can hang out with food and spend time with friends,” Dayya said. There will be a bar-style menu with options such as hamburgers, wings, salads, sandwiches, smoothies and non-alcoholic drinks. LIU Post students can also use their dining dollars on their student ID cards in the bar.
The sports lounge will play live games, including NBA, NFL, and MLB. The bar will be open from Sunday to Wednesday from 6:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. and from Thursday to Saturday 6:30 p.m. to 1 a.m.
“We are looking for more options to give students to enjoy themselves on campus. We are always open to suggestions, and have the students in our best interests,” said Dayya.
“I heard that the Super Bowl party would be in the Pioneer Room, but I didn’t know there would be a sports bar,” said Anthony Vance, a graduate student studying Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages. Vance was happy about having a sports bar on campus. “I was looking for some place to hang out.” He continued, saying that there are not many things to do on campus after he finishes his graduate classes. “My class ends late at night. I don’t have any place to go eat food. I want to see what it’s going to be like,” he said. “It is a little strange that they don’t have alcohol in a bar but for me, that’s fine. I think it is possible without alcohol,” Vance added.
Daniel Potenzieri, SGA president and a senior Political Science major, also joined the Super Bowl Party. “The good thing about student run business is that 100 percent of profits go back to the students. So 50 percent of the profits will go back to the scholarship fund. The other 50 percent is going to the student run businesses’ start-up fund,” said Potenzieri.
Potenzieri added that when students have ideas for businesses, they can submit a proposal to Dayya for consideration.
Potenzieri believes that the sports bar can benefit students in many ways. He said, “Instead of having to travel to the Broadway Mall in Hicksville, students have nine screens and a good sound system in Hillwood Commons. This place can be used for club programming space, so if a club wants to host the UFC fight, they can have the program [in the bar].”

As students returned from winter break and stepped into the familiar lobby of Hillwood, many couldn’t help but notice the new Post Treat Shoppe under construction. While the doors remained unopened during the first week of classes, curiosity still sparked murmurs from those who passed by its clear, closed doors.
Jesus Cardenas, a senior Business and Film double major, who is also a staff member at the Hillwood Information Desk, mentioned that the sweet shop is actually run by students, so students will be able to work in the new candy store. The store will sell both baked goods and candy, such as lollipops, brownies, cookies, cupcakes, and other popular candies. They also have more healthful alternates such as baked chips, Cliff bars, granola, trail mix and unsweetened candy.
“It’s pretty fun,” said Susan Kelly, a junior Fine Arts major, who works at the shoppe. “It’s been exciting working here so far,” she added.
Student reactions were mixed. Some students felt as though the candy store would be a positive and exciting addition to campus, while others felt as though it was unnecessary.
“I just noticed it yesterday,” said Wolfgang Kovac, a freshman who is studying Math, Physics and Science. “I didn’t hear about any plans to make one like I did for the clothing shop. I’m not a big candy person.”
Kathryn Brust, a sophomore Management major and Fundraising officer for the Equestrian Team, mentioned that she was afraid that this new sweet shop would affect fundraising for clubs and other activities. “I think a different store should be opened instead of a sweet shop, because it takes away profit from various clubs and activities that set up bake sales during common hour in Hillwood. How are clubs supposed to raise money if they are in competition with the new store?” She then suggested the idea of having another food vendor open instead, such as Panera Bread.
The store officially opened on Wednesday, Jan. 29.

Each year, film students at LIU Post register for a group class called Production Lab, with the goal of creating a quality short film around 10 to 15 minutes long. Peers break up into three or four groups, assigning roles such as film producer, editor, cinematographer, director, writer and production designer. The college provides a budget of $1000 to go towards costs such as equipment and casting outside of resources provided by the film department itself. The most recent class, instructed by Professor Susan Zeig, has made strides in fundraising on their own.

“The production is coming along well,” said junior Jessica Reyes, who is producing the sci-fi fantasy film “My Friend John.” “Our crowdfunding campaign with Kickstarter finished recently and it went better than any of us could have imagined. We raised a total of $2,500 and had 85 people back our project.”
The “My Friend John” group consists of writer/director junior Henry Arroyo, producers Reyes and junior Ava Gramin, production designer junior Mabel Santos Haugen, cinematographer senior Andrew Barell and editor junior Samuel Askland Gordon. With an initial goal of $2000, the group maintained an online presence by reaching out to friends and family for support. In the final two weeks of fundraising, the flow of donations was slow.
Kickstarter.com, a site that has been used to raise millions of dollars for independent art projects, requires the target goal to be reached, or else all funds are forfeit. Luckily, a rush of funds came in the last week, pushing “My Friend John” above its goal by $500.
Reyes was happily surprised by the amount of unknown funders who backed the project for $100 or more. “It was a great confidence boost,” she said. “[As a student filmmaker], it’s very easy to feel discouraged or insecure about what you’re doing. Knowing you have so many people on your side pushes you to work harder and get the best possible product you can.”
“My Friend John” is yet to set shooting dates, but is narrowing down casting for their main character, the eight-year-old Gio. The film tells the story of the boy, the abusive relationship with his father, and his imaginary friend John, an astronaut who becomes more real than he thought. “It’s hard enough getting anybody to audition for a student film,” added Reyes, “But finding a child actor who meets our character description has been tough. We are still in the process of looking, but we aren’t a group to give up so easily.”
Despite the hardship, Reyes is confident in her group. “I think our strength as a group is our passion and unwillingness to compromise with anything less than we want,” she said. “It can be difficult at times to have six passionate and opinionated people [working together], but it definitely makes us a better team–we have one goal in mind, and that’s to make a film we can be proud of.”
The group was able to secure a deal with the Cradle of Aviation in Uniondale for the use of a real astronaut suit. “I think for me that was a personal victory,” said Reyes. “It was something that seemed impossible, but now with our project funded, it’s a reality. I guess it’s one small step for us, but one giant leap for student filmmaking at this school.”
“My Friend John” was not the only production lab film to raise money. Already partially shot, using Hillwood Commons and the Kahn Building as locations, the group for the film “Love Less Naked” was able to raise $800 through IndieGoGo. The site is similar to Kickstarter, except that fundraisers are able to keep all of the money given, even if a target goal is not reached. “Love Less Naked” is a satirical romantic comedy short, focused on the awkward college-aged Bert (played by actor Darius Copland) whose idealistic view of love conflicts with his pursuit of his dream girl.
Junior Candace Rizkowsky is the producer of “Love Less Naked,” tasked with resolving logistical issues such as securing equipment rentals, location, and generally making sure the production is working within the confines of their budget. That isn’t to say everything has been smooth sailing. “We hit a major challenge on the last day of our first shooting weekend,” said Rizkowsky. “We were surprisingly double booked for a space with an orchestra.” The group was forced to move from the first to the third floor of Hillwood Commons, rewriting a portion of the script to accommodate the change.
Other challenges have included the weather and camera logistics. Recent snowstorms have altered shooting dates for several student film projects, including those shooting their thesis films, and those in production lab. Consequently, dates have been pushed back, and camera rentals at the film department equipment room had to be reevaluated. “Love Less Naked” will commence shooting from Feb. 7 to 9, in Hillwood Commons.
Rizkowsky is not daunted by the trials and tribulations of film sets and is hopeful for the future of “Love Less Naked.” “We really want to be able to send this film to local festivals,” she said. “I wasn’t really sure at first if we could make it to an accordingly high enough level [of quality] for that, but after seeing the material from our first shoot, I believe we could actually win one. I think it will turn out to be a really good film.”

The 12-hour, overnight event known as Relay for Life is coming to LIU Post this spring. The walk, which aims to raise money for cancer research and patients, as well as spreading cancer awareness, will also celebrate the lives of survivors, remember those who lost their lives to cancer, and unite a community in the fight against the disease.
“The event serves as a large-scale community service project and as a campus-wide program where students can come, have fun, and participate in an LIU Post-spirited event. Students will be encouraged to stay up throughout the night and take advantage of all the events have to offer,” said Michael Berthel, the associate director of the Office of Student
Life & Leadership Development, who is also coordinating Relay for Life.
Although Relay for Life events are popular in communities across Long Island, it has never made an appearance on Post’s campus. This will be the first time the student body and staff are holding the program, and many are thrilled about creating a new tradition on campus.
“I am really excited for Relay for Life because it has never been part of my college experience here. I have participated in the event all throughout my middle and high school years and I look forward to continuing it as a college student. Raising money for those with cancer while having a great time is the best way to tackle it,” said Amanda Gaimaro, a sophomore Speech Pathology major.
Post’s goal is to raise $25,000 or more, according to Berthel, for the American Cancer Society through hosting Relay for Life. Students can join teams with their friends, student clubs, or athletics teams. Students can also start their own team or join an existing one.
The event is going to take place on April 25, 2014 on the Great Lawn. It will begin at 5 p.m., with a ceremony and the activities and events will continue until 5 a.m.

The College of Education, Information and Technology Student Council (CEIT), organized and hosted two non-exclusive open events in attempt to engage the students on any questions they may have about their campus and to get an understanding of their needs and interests. This was the council’s first event they organized and took place on Wednesday, January 29.
CEIT is a student council made up students, faculty, and administration. Matthew Coleman, the president of CEIT Student Council, and a graduate student in Adolescence Education, further clarified the purpose of the council. “Ultimately, we cater to the students and want to provide every student with a voice. We are an open-minded and flexible organization and have received tremendous support from Dean Robert Hannafin [the Dean of the College of Education] and Dr. Vincent Scovetta [faculty liaison].” Coleman continued, “Ideally, the student council will develop a home base for CEIT students. We would like to plan a variety of networking and social events.”
“Meet the Dean!” was the name of the event, and it occurred during common hour in the Pioneer Room. The meeting was geared toward undergraduate students, due to the availability they have during common hour. However, although the meetings were intended for students within the College of Education they ended up serving students of all majors. The second meeting was held on the same day from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., and was hosted in the Instructional Media Center (IMC), located in the basement of the Library. The evening meeting was offered at a later time to fit the schedule of graduate students. However, neither of the meetings were exclusive, both graduate and undergraduate students were encouraged to attend the events. The event was promoted via Twitter, Facebook and flyers around campus according to Coleman.
The common hour event was attended by roughly 60 students, while the evening meeting was attended by about ten. Nonetheless, students who attended the events completed anonymous surveys. Sarah
Naqvi-Syed, a senior English major and secretary of the CEIT Student Council, explained the purpose of the anonymous survey. “We wanted to have an account of what the students are interested in
seeing or learning more about from the CEIT so that the CEIT student council can attempt to meet and address their needs and interests and allow them a way to voice their concerns or opinions, which can then be relayed to their departments,” Naqvi-Syed said.
“We also wanted to allow the CEIT student council to see the students are interested in joining the council (this is the tear-off section which includes their name and email for the $50 raffle, so we can contact them).” During the meeting students received a cookie, and were entered into the $50 raffle once they completed the survey. Naqvi-Syed said that the winners will be revealed this week via email.
At both meetings, Hannafin, the dean of the College of Education, was present and was attentive of the students. “Dean Hannafin sat with students and spoke with them. CEIT student council wrist bands were given out to those interested in joining the council,” Naqvi-Syed stated. “Dean Hannafin spoke individually to students who attended and asked him their own questions and voiced their concerns and opin- ions.”
Hannaffin was pleased with the outcome and the effort of the CEIT Student Council. “I love the energy, I love the willingness to make something better and put the time in, ” he said. Get involved, you’ll enjoy your experience here more.”
CEIT Student Council is hopeful for the future and is looking to make the “Meet the Dean!” event an annual tradition, according to Syed and Coleman. They are focused on spreading the word of the council and establishing worthwhile events for the LIU Post student body. “Overall we had a great turn out of students from many different majors and de- partments,” Syed concluded.

A new semester at LIU Post means a fresh start for all students, a sea of new faces, and a plethora of activities for students to participate in. Cold temperatures and snow fall graced the Post campus at the start of the spring semester, and this year incoming as well as returning students were welcomed back to campus with a snowstorm and class cancellations, as opposed to the Welcome Week students are so used to.
As a severe snowstorm swept the East Coast on Jan. 21, the first day of the spring semester, travel and other activities were interrupted due to inclement conditions. As poor weather conditions worsened, the university cancelled classes and activities, including all the Welcome Week activities.
“This year, because of weather, we had to postpone our Hot Chocolate Social, Dream Catcher Program, and hypnotist,” read an email sent by Malcolm McDaniel, secretary of the Association for Campus Programming (ACP).
Welcome Week during the spring semester is similar to Welcome Week during the fall semester. However, they differ in their attempts to bring students together during the winter months. The activities provided for students include winter related activities, some indoor, as well as outside in the snow, but each activity is fun in its own way. During the start of the fall semester, the weather is much warmer and students are occupied with various activities such as ice cream socials and outdoor activities such as a barbecue on Riggs lawn and carnival games and rides for students to enjoy. Spring Welcome Week does the same with fun winter related activities to keep students engaged with one another in the last few months before the summer break.
Activities, which were cancelled at the start of the spring semester, have recommenced in a timely fashion. To keep things running smoothly and as planned for all students, ACP combined their Hot Chocolate Social and Dream Catcher Program into one night of events. From 7–9 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 30, students were given the opportunity to attend the Hot Chocolate Social, where students were able to participate in games, create personalized iPhone cases, and enjoy cups of hot chocolate.
Activities were then followed by a showing of “The Best Man Holiday” in the Gold Coast cinema, as part of ACP’s movie series.
“I do not dorm on campus, so I don’t know much about Welcome Week, but it sounds like a really fun time for students,” said Andria Lynn Osler, a Public Relations major. “I wish these events were advertised more so that I, as well as many others who may not live here on campus, could partake in such activities.”
ACP has more events planned for students as the weeks progress. Students can look forward to an off-campus trip to the outlets, where they can shop or simply browse the stores, as well as an ice skating trip for those looking to get off campus for a little winter time fun. “We are also looking for possible dates in February to reschedule the hypnotist,” read an email from ACP.
Although the winter cold and snow is brutal, tiring, and makes students want to retreat to their dorm rooms whenever possible, students are constantly provided with various opportunities to have fun and stay active in the warmth of student centers and residence halls. Welcome Week is one way to keep students active within the school community and to help keep spirits high during the blistering cold months ahead.

“It Takes a Village,” a student run organization that works alongside the Division of Student Affairs at LIU Post, and is sponsored by the Post Leadership Advisory Network (PLAN), aids students with textbook costs by providing book scholarships for those who are in need. The “village” consists of student volunteers, faculty, staff, administrators, alumni and trustees who have contributed to the cause through donations.
The organization currently has no budget, and primarily sustains from donations. Textbooks are often an imperative tool needed in order to succeed, but one that many students have found to be a challenge to afford. “Your penny + My penny = Our education,” is the organization’s slogan, according to President Arianna Liverri.
“I was not aware of this particular scholarship, but I am pleased to know that it exists. I think it’s great because it’s for students, by stu- dents,” said Roberta Young, a senior Public Relations major. “The con- tributions and ideas come from our peers, who know firsthand what we deal with at the beginning of a new semester.”
The It Takes a Village Book Scholarship is available to undergradu- ate students enrolled in 12 or more credits. The applicant must have a completed FAFSA for the academic year. A minimum of 2.25 cumulative GPA must be maintained. The applicant must also have a blemish free disciplinary record and should not currently be on academic probation. To be considered as a recipient, a copy of your current class schedule is to be attached to a properly filled out application. A 500-word essay answering the question, “Why should you be a recipient of this scholarship?” is also required.
Students, who were recipients of the scholarship in the past, should explain their reasoning for reapplying and how the scholarship has helped you to succeed academically in their essay. However, in order to be eligible to reapply for the scholarship, applicants must volunteer and contribute a total of six hours of community service to the LIU Post com- munity.
Required eligibility for the scholarship is based upon the appli- cant’s current need for financial assistance. The scholarship reward is reliant upon the amount of donations the program receives. Through fundraisers, more than $2,000 has been raised thus far. A majority of the funds come from the Association for Campus Programming (ACP). ACP organizes campus events to enhance campus life outside the class- room.
There are a limited number of scholarships available to students. Unfortunately, due to limited financial resources, the scholarship will only cover the costs of textbooks for the current semester and may or may not cover your entire textbook bill. Students interested in making a difference are encouraged to become members of the program.
To find out how you can contribute to the organization or for more information contact LIUPostVillage@gmail.com or contact Alerie Tirsch, director of Student Life and Leadership Development, at Alerie.Tirsch@ liu.edu or (516) 299-2800.

During the winter break, LIU Post’s Office of Student Life and Leadership Development sent out a 70-question survey via email to all students. The survey asked for various ways to help evaluate and improve student life at Post. The students who completed the survey were entered into a raffle to win a $150 gift card and other various prizes.
Michael Berthel, associate director of Student Life, responded to questions about the survey that were directed to Alerie Tirsch, the director of Student Life. “One thousand, one hundred and sixty-three students, which is just under 26 percent of our population, responded,” Berthel said. However, the survey was sent out to all undergraduate and graduate students.
Kate Gambino, a sophomore Journalism major, and Chloe Evans, a senior Medical Imaging major, both responded with, “What survey?” when asked if they had completed it.
“I don’t ever check my school email unless a professor tells me to,” said Hunter Stones, a junior Social Work major.
The intention of the survey, according to Berthel, was to capture students’ thoughts, perceptions, and satisfaction with their experience at LIU Post, particularly their experiences outside of the classroom, but the majority of students did not respond.
Despite the low response rate, “We were able to find out a ton of information with the answers we received,” Berthel said.
“The most exciting thing for us was that an overwhelming amount of students are enjoying their social experience and feel connected to student life at LIU Post. In addition, a majority of students are happy with the events being offered. There are plenty of suggestions in the survey for us to work on and some changes that we will bring about as a result.”
“It is going to change the way we look at all of our programs, events, and services. We are going to use it to know what is going well and what we should keep doing, what is not going so well and what we need to change, and what is missing and what we need to add,” Berthel added.
“The Student Life and Leadership Development office shared the results of the survey with 40 of the campus’ student leaders during our annual winter leadership retreat, and it was able to give us some great insight into our programming on campus. The student leaders have put forth a tremendous amount of effort in planning more programs for the LIU Post community during the spring semester,” said Dan Potenzieri, a senior Political Science major and the Student Government president.
Since students requested “more comedians, more movie nights, and leadership workshops,” Post is already implementing these programs for the spring semester. Although some changes may be carried out during this semester, others may take a semester or two, according to Berthel. “The school is constantly talking about what to do next for students and how we can make the student experience better each semester,” said Berthel.
As for the $150 raffle, the winners will be notified this week.

After a month-long break, the campus at LIU Post is coming to life again for the spring semester. Whether you want to attend an event at the Tilles Center, or become a part of life on campus, there is a lot to look forward to this semester.
If you want to laugh, cry, or just be entertained, there is always an event to see at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at LIU Post. The Tilles Center brings programs of every genre right to campus. They are sure to keep you, your friends and family entertained on every occasion. If you are an undergraduate student enrolled in at least 12 credits, then you are automatically eligible to receive discounted tickets for select performances with your student ID. This weekend, if you have a love for Broadway’s theatrical performances then you’re in luck. Kristin Chenoweth, who is well known for her success in film, television and theatre, is bringing Broadway to Tilles on Feb. 7.
“Every ‘Glee’ and ‘Wicked’ fan wants to come see Kristin Chenoweth,” said Chris Russomanno, a junior Accounting major, who is an assistant box officer manager at the Tilles Center. VIP tickets, which include privileges like an exclusive meet and greet, up close seats, limited edition collectible merchandise, and a personal photograph with Chenoweth, are selling rapidly.
However, if you aren’t a fan of Chenoweth, there are still many more events at the Tilles Center for you to attend. Broadway’s popular rock n’ roll musical, “American Idiot,” will take over the Tilles Center on Feb. 16. The highly anticipated “Bring It On: The Musical,” which The New York Times called, “impossible to resist,” will appear on March 30, while on their national tour.
If you’ve ever thought about joining Greek life at LIU Post, this semester is the time to do it. If you missed Meet The Greeks on Saturday, Feb. 1st, which gave students the opportunity to meet the various fraternities and sororities on campus, there are still opportunities to find out more about your favorite Greek organization.
“Joining the fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha was one of the best decisions I’ve made as a young man in college,” said Kareem O’Neill, a senior Forensic Science major.
The Panhellenic Conference for the sororities at Post will take place on Feb. 10 until Feb. 14. This event will allow students to become a part of the sorority of their choice. You must register online in order to be recruited into a sorority at the event. For more information about the conference, students can contact a Greek advisor at (516) 299-2818.
“We want the girls to figure out where they want to go,” said Kate Gambino, a sophomore Journalism and Photography minor, who works with new member chairs, and said her goal is not to promote her personal sorority. Be sure to attend the Panhellenic Conference at Post to find out the true meaning of “college fades, sisterhood remains.”
An event that is highly anticipated by some of the performers on campus is Association for Campus Programming’s Post Idol. Jesus Cardenas, senior Business and Film double major and brother of Lamba Sigma Upsilon, will be the host. Auditions will take place all through April, and the winner has the rare opportunity to open up for the main guest performing at this year’s Spring Fling.
If you have a love for fashion or modeling, the Runway might be the club for you. Cardenas, who is also on the e-board and male coordinator for the club, expressed that he, along with other people in the club, are really excited for the Fashion Show, which will take place on March 2 at the Tilles Center.
Another event that is sure to unite all LIU Post students and faculty is Relay For Life on April 24. It is a 12-hour event from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. that raises money for cancer research and patients. Relay For Life will not only enrich your life, but also the lives of others as you spread cancer awareness, celebrate the lives of survivors, and help raise money to assist in the fight against cancer.
However, if you feel like your interests haven’t been met just yet, there are still many more options that enable you to experience the diversity of Post. Regardless of religious affiliation, you can join clubs such as the Hillel, Gospel Choir or the Pagan club. Jonathan Seltzer, a senior Public Relations major and a member of the Hillel club, expressed his excitement for the upcoming Shabbat dinners being held for students that affiliate with the Jewish faith.
There are over 80 clubs at LIU Post and one of them is sure to be your niche. If you’d like to learn more about the various clubs on campus, information is posted at the Hillwood Information desk.

Many parents drop their college students off at their dorms, drive away and then wonder how long it will be before the phone rings. Hours? Days? Months? To many college students, this is their first real chance at independence and some don’t plan on picking up the phone anytime soon.

So how do students communicate with their parents and balance their schoolwork at the same time without feeling overwhelmed? First, accept the fact that there is no perfect approach for this. It could be a brief text every other day, a phone call on a set day and time every week, or two long letters per month. You’ll discover that a natural pattern of connecting with each other will progress over time.
“I talk to my mom on the phone every Sunday morning around the same time,” said Chloe Evans, a senior Medical Imaging major. “It’s kind of nice to have that routine day and time to talk with her. My mom never demanded that we talk on the phone once a week. It just evolved that way and continued.”
For many students, failing to call home frequently can be a positive development. They are most likely actively engaged in their college life, enjoying themselves and have a full and fun schedule. They may be attending classes, going to campus activities, hanging out with their new friends, or doing homework. All of these are not just normal, but also great signs that a student has made a successful college transition.
However, some students communicate with their parents on a much more frequent basis. “I call my mom almost everyday after I’m finished with class. I mostly call her, she usually will call me on weekends so she doesn’t catch me in class,” said Jaclyn Baum, a senior Graphic Design major.
“I miss home since I live about two hours away. But it is nice to have freedom while living on campus.” Hunter Stones, a junior Social Work Major, said, “I usually talk to my parents about once every two weeks, but sometimes less often depending on how busy I am. My dad joked that he only knew I was alive because of my credit card bills. I do know some people who talk to their parents every day though.”
“My sister and I are both away at college,” said Shannon Reilly, a junior Medical Imaging major. “I call home every few days when I remember and go home about every other weekend. My parents always tell me that they would like to hear from me more, but I enjoy the space. I just miss my dogs,” Reilly added.
“My parents give me my space and I love it. I talk to them on average four times a week plus text messages and it’s no problem. It’s enough to keep in touch but I also have my distance,” said Ashley Munford, a junior Education major.
“My parents are busy. They don’t call me often. I call them often–maybe four times a week. Now it is lunar New Year, so I call all family members for greeting,” Said Tansy Liu, an international Journalism major from China.
“We’re independent adults with our own needs and our own lives to lead. That’s where the guilt comes in,” said Stones, when asked about the need to update his parents about every detail of his college life. “No matter how old we are, we’re still our parents’ children, and they expect to hear from us.”

On Sunday, Feb. 2, 2014, Super Bowl XLVIII took place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This year was the 48th Super Bowl. The competing football teams in this year’s game were the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos. Both the Seahawks and the Broncos have matching records of 15 wins, three losses. The Seattle Seahawks dominated the Denver Broncos, 48-8.
For many college students at LIU Post, Super Bowl Sunday meant parties with big screen televisions, barbecue wings, and talking with friends about the highlights of the game and the best commercials. However, for many other students, Sunday was a day to work or volunteer.
Brandi Tenaglia, a sophomore Psychology major, laughed as she said, “I bathed dogs all day at work [at Petco].” Sean Kearns, a junior Film major, helped those in need this past Super Bowl Sunday. “I worked at Harold’s Soup Kitchen in Levittown. I made the clam chowder–people gotta [sic] eat. They had a radio on, so we listened to the Super Bowl while they ate the soup,” Kearns added. Richie Ciullo, a junior Health Sciences major, also spent his day working. “I work at a pizzeria for which I deliver. I made good money during the Super Bowl.”
However, some students spent the day partaking in traditional Super Bowl festivities. “I went to my cousin’s house in Great Neck for a Super Bowl Party. Some friends and family were there. I was pretty indifferent regarding who won the game–I just wanted a good game,” said Vic Muntean, a senior Business Management major. Louis Salzberg, a Health Sciences major, wasn’t too concerned about the event. “I didn’t make plans,” he added.
“I wasn’t doing anything, really, but I would have rather watched it with a group rather than by myself. I was rooting for the Broncos,” said Gary Malfa, a junior Film major.
Malfa was enthused at the idea that a Manning brother was playing in the Super Bowl and added, “Always root for a Manning brother in the Super Bowl.” However, Peyton Manning, who has had a star season as the Broncos’ quarterback, did not perform to the best of his abilities at Sunday’s game.
The overwhelming majority of students interviewed responded that they would be working through this year’s festivities. Some students responded that they would have watched the game with family and friends.

In college, trying to balance work, school and your social life may leave you wondering how to fit it all in. With the freedom to choose how to spend their time, college students may find themselves struggling to maintain grades and keep up with friends. Every student has wished for more hours in a day, but focusing priorities and learning time management skills can help balance college and everyday life.
One of the most laborious aspects of a college student’s life is academics. Between classes, assignments and studying, the days can become short and a student’s time can become consumed by school. In order to put time aside for things that don’t involve textbooks, budgeting your time can be extremely beneficial.
“I carry my planner with me everywhere and write down all my homework deadlines and work schedule, so I’m completely organized,” said Brittney Cataldo, a senior Early Education major. Scheduling can be essential to succeeding as a college student. With a busy and packed schedule, academics can suffer.
Many students are not only enrolled in school and worried about friendships, but many also have part-time jobs they need to maintain. Setting aside a certain time during the week to work on particular assignments and planning workdays around your most difficult classes can be a profitable solution.
When students put social activities first, it can become more difficult to negotiate school and work commitments. Building a schedule could help ensure that you have time for everything—work, school, and a social life, without feeling overwhelmed by all the different demands.
With the various responsibilities students have, they often can neglect themselves. A student’s own personal health needs, like diet, exercise, and sleep, can be completely forgotten once school starts. “Personally, I put time for myself first. Sometimes in order for me to study or finish an assignment, I need to clear my head. Whether it’s watching TV or listening to music, I just need those few minutes,” said Joseph Marra, a senior Computer Science major.
“Once school starts, I set aside two days during the week when I can work out,” Cataldo added. “Exercising relaxes me and increases my concentration on my homework. It makes me feel refreshed.”
Students who work hard at school and jobs and then manage to squeeze in time for a social life can quickly become burdened by demanding obligations. Complying with a moderation mantra will help students stay sane throughout the semester.

If you had endless amounts of money, how would you spend it? Sadly, that may be a question that we only face in our dreams, and not in reality.
Personally, if I had as much money as the richest person in the world, I would use it to open up a great restaurant in the city. The food would be the best because I would have the best chefs, and the people working for me would know the ins and outs of cooking. In addition to that, I would want to do a lot of traveling and go to a lot of places that many people don’t get the chance to go to. I would love to go to Europe and just travel from country to country because of the rich history that the continent has.
“I would use the money to buy one of my favorite sports franchises,” said Nicholas Laspin, freshman Physical Education major.
“It would be awesome to be the person at the top of that franchise as the owner, and the person signing the checks for the entire working staff at the facility.” Another way to look at it is that in buying a team or franchise, you make a lot of your money back with merchandise, tickets, and food. It is an investment that constantly pays for itself with tons of money coming in the door.
Joseph Ansalone, junior Physical Education major, would have different plans. “If I had that kind of money, I would want to open a huge gym with all the best equipment, best trainers, best everything. There would be sports facilities for basketball, football, soccer, everything.” This relates to sports, but has a different twist to it. In this case, Ansalone is reaching out and doing something that he loves and has a passion for. That is something that everybody wants to do find something that they enjoy doing and doing it for a living, and being able to pass it on to other people.
According to Forbes Magazine, in 2013 Bill Gates was the richest American, valued at $67 billion. However, he was second in the world behind Mexico’s Carlos Slim Helu, who was at $73 billion. If you want to put the amount of money these guys have in perspective, take a look at early industrial America.
If their money was inflation-adjusted to today’s economy, people like John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Cornelius Vanderbilt would all be worth more than double Gates’ $67 billion. Gates’ fortune would be pocket change to these men, the lowest being $185 billion.
So if you had as much money as these people, how would you spend it?

Since 1995, online dating has been growing rapidly and gaining popularity. More and more couples are getting together via social networks and matchmaking websites. According to The Province News, the web consists of about three million active online dating users. However, online dating doesn’t always turn out well, especially if you’re unsure of who you are really talking to.
Online dating can be described as a dating experience that allows individuals to contact and communicate through the Internet. There are many sites on the web in which people can fill out surveys and the website matches them up with another person who matches their survey. People then begin talking online, exchanging numbers and, if they are interested, they set up real dates. However, there is a catch to this; most websites charge a fee in order for you to get matched up. Prices range from $7 to $60 a month, depending on the website.
“I don’t think that you should have to pay any type of money to match yourself up with somebody,” said Abby Brosnan, a sophomore Broadcasting major, who believes that online dating is a scam. “Actually, my grandmother is doing online dating now at eharmony.com, and she was required to pay a fee before contacting her matchmaker.”
Sometimes online dating has proven to work, and a lot of people have found their soulmate. However, online dating is not 100 percent safe, and sometimes there are frauds, predators, rapists, and individuals who pretend to be someone who they’re not. There have been television shows that have caught and exposed these people by showing their conversations and revealing their faces. Some of these shows are MTV’s “Catfish” and NBC’s “To Catch a Predator.”
Toni Barton, a sophomore Criminal Justice major, is also not a fan of online dating. “I definitely wouldn’t do online dating. I see thousands of people a day; I don’t see the need to meet people online.
According to The Global Post, 18 percent of people ages 17–29 use online dating. There are many sites that are strictly dedicated to college students. Datemyschool.com, campushook.com, and universityloveconnection.com are some of the most popular dating sites for college students. Some are free while others cost a monthly fee. However, some students at Post don’t seem to engage too much in online dating. Senior Sociology major Azamat Doszhan also objects to online dating. “It’s not natural,” he said. Doszhan believes that it’s not legitimate.
There are a few reasons why people may participate in online dating. One reason is because they feel more comfortable talking online. Another reason is because it’s a quick and easy way to meet new people. Lastly, there are some people who have been looking for love for a long time and haven’t been able to find it, so a matchmaking site might seem logical to them.
In my opinion, online dating has its pros and cons. I know people who have found lasting relationships after meeting online. However, I also am aware that it is not 100 percent safe all the time. If you’re going to participate in online dating, just make sure that you are careful and know that a person is legitimate.

Although Martin Scorcese’s latest film picked up five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture of the Year, “The Wolf of Wall Street’s” scandalized plot line and depictions of excess in sex, drugs, and stock trading shocked and awed audiences worldwide. 
The movie is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a New York based stockbroker who goes from rags to extreme riches after establishing his own firm and engaging in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street during the ‘90s. The storyline follows Stratton Oakmont’s (the name of the firm) anything, but humble beginnings as Belfort and his partners enjoy an endless parade of mixing business with pleasure in the form of lavish parties, prostitutes, and drug abuse.
Post students have mixed opinions of the film. “It was a great movie,” said Josh Sutphen, a freshman Nutrition major. “[But it’s] definitely [better suited] for adult audiences. Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio were so funny and had great chemistry together. I would definitely see it again,” Sutphen added.
“I thought it was very vulgar and exaggerated with the party scenes and drug abuse,” said Laren Lipari, a freshman Radiology major. “But DiCaprio was perfect in it, he can play any character.” DiCaprio has been lauded for his acting work in the film, winning the Best Actor award at the Golden Globes last month.
“Personally, I’m kind of split on the whole thing,” admitted Tina Marie Bonsangue, a freshman Pre-Law major. “I think it was an excellent movie in one sense because the actors were phenomenal in portraying their roles. DiCaprio had a great transition from naive broker to the face of corruption.”
“I feel it should have been more restricted,” Bonsangue said. “You have immature 17-year-olds, maybe even younger, viewing this movie as nothing but an inspiration, and [they’re] taking [the concepts of] money and power and sex and drugs at a face value rather than [considering] the consequences of what happened. I feel the older generations would appreciate the movie [more] for the actual message,” she added.
“Speaking as a 19-year-old fuddy-duddy, I have a problem when directors feel like they need to add a whole bunch of sex and violence to their films to tell a story–more likely to sell tickets really,” said Jacob Schmotzer, a freshman English and Education major. “While I do not believe films like [“The Wolf of Wall Street”] should be banned or censored, I do wish that more directors would return to the types of movies that were [produced] during Hollywood’s golden age. Films back then were still marketed towards adults, yet they were somehow more intelligent, more tasteful, and certainly more subtle in a way that made you think.”
“The Wolf of Wall Street” has enjoyed blockbuster status since its release back in December, racking up big at the box office as well as collecting numerous distinctions during the 2014 awards season. With this continued excellence following the film’s controversial legacy, it is something moviegoers will be raving and ranting about for years to come.

Coming off of an impressive 29 point victory against Daemen College, the Lady Pioneers (14-5) looked to continue their solid play against the Redhawks of Roberts Wesleyan in their Sun. matinee on Feb. 2.
Early on in the first half, the game was there for the taking as neither team could gain much positive momentum. The back and forth battle continued for roughly 10 minutes as neither team could take control. With the score holding at 17-13 in favor of the Pioneers, junior guard Chelsea Williams converted on a layup. That basket started what became a 22-8 run. During that run, senior forward Shayna Gatling scored five points while Williams and junior guard Ariana Ijaduola both scored four points.
The exclamation point to the Pioneers great first half play was a last second basket by Williams which gave the Pioneers an 11 point lead heading into halftime. For the Redhawks, it was junior forward Chelsea Sanders, who was trying to keep them in the game with 12 points and junior guard Jenna Johnson who had eight points. The first half featured a strong effort down low from the Pioneers as they outscored their op- ponent 32-12 in the paint. The effort also showed on the defensive end as they forced 11 turnovers and converted them in 14 points.
In the second half, it was more of the same from the Pioneers as they continued their stellar play. The second half push was led by sopho- more guard Quanisha Ratley and senior guard Alexis Peters, who each poured in double digit figures. With 13:35 remaining in regulation, the green and gold’s lead reached its peak as Ratley nailed a three pointer, giving the Pioneers a 60-42 advantage.
The game seemed pretty much in hand, until a late run by the Redhawks, who cut the deficit from 18 to six. Free throws iced the game and a layup by Peters sealed the deal, giving the Pioneers the nine point victory 78-69.
For the Pioneers, the scoring was well distributed as they had five players score in double figures. The Pioneers led the Redhawks in the hustle stats as well, outscoring them by five in second chance points, 14 in fast break points, and 14 in points off turnovers.
Coach Moore and the Lady Pioneers return to the hardwood on Thurs. Feb. 6 when they host the University of the District of Columbia in an ECC battle. Tipoff is slated for 5 p.m. from Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, NY.

As a senior on the women’s lacrosse team, Melissa Rohr is looking forward to the upcoming season. Rohr’s ultimate goal is to repeat a national championship. She mentioned that the team needs to take it day by day and progress throughout the season in order to capture the title.
Rohr has been playing lacrosse since she was 12 years old. She had always been an athlete and wanted to try something new. The new-ness of lacrosse is what gauged her interest to the sport because it wasn’t as popular as it is now.
Rohr shared with me some of the strengths and weaknesses of the team. They specialize in being a very positive group of players that have developed excellent team chemistry. The other players look up to Rohr as a leader because of her positive mentality and mindset on and off the field. Rohr also mentioned that the team is a cohesive bunch who has unbelievable culture and chemistry both on and off the field. One of the team’s few weaknesses is that they could sometimes get too caught up in the big picture.
The team’s practices are difficult and intense, but they are productive every day. Despite the weather being a big factor, Rohr and her teammates have performed efficiently during practice. As a defender, Rohr plays at the lowest point on the field and she sees everything that›s going on, which is beneficial toward her game. Having a good defense is also essential to winning championships because it›s the backbone of your team.
The positive team helps the team’s success because the players have bonded and have become closer over time. In addition, the players understand each other’s flaws, which contributes to their team camaraderie. Rohr and her teammates describe themselves as one big family.
Rohr predicts that the Pioneers will repeat as national champions and have another outstanding season. She always heads into the season with a positive attitude. It takes work to get where you want to be, but her mindset works heavily in her favor. Rohr stated that “mind over matter” is what drives this team forward and leads to their achievements.

Super Bowl XLVIII set the Denver Broncos against the Seattle Seahawks. Tickets for this year’s Super Bowl were like gold dust. Finding the tickets in order to purchase them was one thing, but who ever dreamed of getting them for free? To win Super Bowl tickets just two weeks before the big event is quite extraordinary, but one lucky LIU Post student did just that.

Marisa DeSilvestre, a third year student in the Radiological Technology program at LIU Post, has just begun the clinical rotations portion of her degree at a local hospital. However, in her spare time, she organizes blood drives for the New York Blood Center, an admirable feat for a busy college student on the cusp of an important semester.
Blood donors were placed in a raffle for Super Bowl tickets. Many individuals have been in a raffle before, but this particular raffle was statewide. The New York Blood Center offered two tickets for the lucky winner chosen from a pool of donors from both July and December blood drives.
What was the chance of winning? Pretty low. What DeSilvestre did not know was that the hosts were also entered for the chance to win. DeSilvestre remembers receiving the call while working out in the gym.
“I said, ‘No, seriously what is the call really about?’” She laughed as she reminisced. “Then I was just in shock. I couldn’t believe it. I’m so fortunate to win such a great prize,” she said.
Winning two Super Bowl tickets required an important decision; whom would DeSilvestre take along for such a tremendous experience? DeSilvestre said, “My family members are huge New York Giants fans, and my brothers actually have season tickets. That’s a tough decision for anyone; a father and four brothers, all huge football fans, two tickets.” DeSilvestre explained, “In the end, I chose to take my father. He has done so much for me and he’s never been [to the Super Bowl], so it’s a great feeling to be able to give something back.”
DeSilvestre’s good fortune appeared on the radar of LIU President Kimberly R. Cline, who requested a meeting with DeSilvestre to talk about the remarkable circumstances surrounding her win. DeSilvestre met the LIU president, took a couple of pictures, and even went on a little tour while Cline talked through a few of the great improvements set to begin at LIU Post. “She is such a sweet person, and had a real interest in the work I do with the blood center,” added DeSilvestre.
This year’s Super Bowl was at MetLife stadium located in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home to both the New York Giants and the New York Jets. The official website for this year’s event described it as, “A Super Bowl so historic, it takes two states to host it,” which was an impressive description that left every football fan in a spiral of excitement.
People choose to donate blood out of the goodness of their hearts with the knowledge that it will help someone, somewhere, someday. The same is true for organizers who pledge time in aid of this cause. This amazing prize was an incredible gesture from the New York Blood Centre in a bid to attract more donors. It also is a way for the organization to give something back to the generous people who donate their blood at drives across the state.
It was an exciting couple of weeks for DeSilvestre, topped off in style on Sunday, February 2, when she became part of a very small group of people who attended one of the world’s major sporting events. Who did DeSilvestre support on Sunday? “The Broncos, because it’s Eli’s brother,” she said.
