Over the past couple of semesters, more and more students have been attracted to Hicksville for off-campus housing, causing an everyday struggle for students to board the free shuttle, which has a 25 person occupancy limit, to school in the mornings. As a result, the Office of Campus Life and the Student Government Association have worked together to improve transportation—and more options are underway.
Students, faculty, and staff are taking advantage of the shuttle services, and the same hours seem to appeal to them all. “9.00 a.m. is by far the busiest time,” said Ian Jonson, a freshman undeclared major who lives in the Hicksville area. “I’ve been at the bus stop 20 minutes before the shuttle is supposed to leave, and you could tell straight away it wasn’t enough.”
The excessive demand for the crowded morning shuttle buses leaves students with two options: to go hard or to go home. “Lines have been non-exist[ent], and those getting a spot on the bus have usually been those with the sharpest elbows,” Jonson said. Instead of taking the risk, Jonson and his housemates have given up the extra hour of sleep, and are taking the 8 a.m. shuttle instead to make sure they don’t miss class.
Recently, the Office of Campus Life and SGA have studied the issue, and together worked on changes to the shuttles. “Along with the SGA, we constantly monitor the transportation needs of our students and make changes accordingly,” said Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students.
“Van Vlerah and I actually rode [the shuttle] last week sometime in the afternoon, to get feedback from students,” Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, added.
The changes already in place have not increased the amount of rides to and from Hicksville; the latest round that used to leave campus at 9 p.m. has been taken away, and the shuttle is now going at 1 p.m. instead, breaking the previous almost six-hour break the shuttle used to have between 10:20 a.m. and 4 p.m.
“It is an expensive and year-round service, so we have tried to play around with the schedule before increasing any costs,” Berthel said. “SGA has allocated over $100,000 for the student shuttle service during the 2014-2015 academic year,” he added.
For those who dorm and don’t own a car, the off-campus shuttles to Hicksville and Pathmark in Greenvale have been the only free alternatives to leave the campus. “During weekdays, I try not to take the shuttle after its break in the afternoon because I know it will be completely full of commuters,” said Tine Markar Lolland, a junior Public Relations major. Lolland explained that the weekends are the only times she does not have any problems.
To facilitate leaving campus for on- campus students, the university will launch a new Zipcar program on Wednesday, Oct. 22, which will allow students to use an on-campus rental car all hours.
The Zipcar project is a global car- sharing network with operations at other college campuses throughout the U.S. Any student over 18, faculty over 21, or community member who has been a licensed driver for a minimum of one year (international licenses accepted) can apply. After registering online, and paying the annual membership fee ($25 for first year), students can reserve a car at any time of the day. Over the first month, students will be discounted for their first $35 driving dollars, according to William Achnitz, Campus Life Coordinator and Sustainability Coordinator. The rental will take place outside of Post Hall.
Jonson believes it is only fair to give the residents another option to leave campus; however, he wants to see some action taken on the free Hicksville shuttle, as well. “The shuttle is a service offered by the school, and you can’t offer services unless you can guarantee all those wishing to utilize it will be able to.”
Berthel stated that he understands where the frustration with the shuttle service comes from. “Students definitely have reasons to complain,” he said.
“The services are paid for by university and student funds, ultimately coming from student activity fees.”
SGA and Campus Life are considering further changes to the shuttle service that may affect the university wallet moving forward. “We are looking into a bigger bus,” Berthel said. “We are also thinking about moving the bus stop from the Chapel to the Humanities area where most departments are located; this way, students will get dropped off closer to the classrooms.”
However, Berthel warned students not to expect major changes any time soon. “Be patient. It is not going to happen overnight.”

This past Friday, LIU Post held its annual Homecoming Pep Rally. This was the first time Pep Rally was held outdoors; the event took place at the new Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. The stands were packed with cheering fans, loud, energetic music, and an atmosphere that revved up the students for homecoming the next day.
The Pep Rally showcased all of the student athletes from different sports teams—such as the golf team, the volleyball team, and of course the football team—as well as other organizations.

The teams were announced by name as they approached the field while the stands went wild. Performances at the Pep Rally featured the Pioneerettes, the school’s kickline, the LIU Post cheerleaders and the Dance Team. Faye Bourie, a senior Psychology major, performed in the Post Student Dance Association’s act at the Pep Rally. “It was a really great experience performing at the Pep Rally—it’s nice to see how all our work and dedication finally paid off—and also all of the Post Pride. Go Pioneers!”
“I love going to Post, and the Pep Rally and homecoming [events] are great ways for everyone to get together to show much they love the school. I had a great time at the Pep Rally, and I cannot wait for homecoming,” said Robert Goldstein, a junior Accounting major and Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity member. Towards the end of the Pep Rally, the M.C. announced the winners of Homecoming King and Queen and the crowd responded with applause. Romar Lyle was named Homecoming King and Christina Principato was named Queen.
The new king and queen received crowns to wear and made a huge announcement for their new titles. The Pep Rally concluded with the Dance Team and cheerleaders rushing the field along without the school’s mascot, the Pioneer.
“[Homecoming is] a great experience to allow students to come together and show their school spirit,” said Stephanie Rubenfeld, a senior Psychology major. “It really allows commuter students to get involved in a way in which they normally wouldn’t have because they are not on campus as much.”

On Oct. 14, the Association for Campus Programming held a Green and Gold Tie-Dye event as part of LIU Post’s Spirit Week, which was part of Homecoming 2014. This is one of several events ACP has held leading up to the football game on Saturday, Oct. 18.
The event was held in The End Zone in Hillwood Commons during common hour. Free white t-shirts were provided for students, along with beads and scissors to customize their shirts. Although students were given all the materials, the dyeing was completely up to them. Students sprayed their shirts in green and gold, the school’s colors. Matthew Blanar, a Campus Life Coordinator, demonstrated different designs and patterns to the participants as about 20 students watched. In total, approximately 40 students took part in the tie-dyeing.
ACP’s responsibility is to keep students involved on campus outside of the classroom. One of their main events during the year is the annual spring fling concert. “We want to focus on the student body,” said Gizelle Aguilar, the President of ACP and a senior Education major. Although Aguilar preferred to give away regular t-shirts with an ACP logo she felt that the event was a success, and so did other students.
“You feel an attachment to school spirit when you make your own shirt,” said Sherry Sweeney, a freshman Psychology major who attended tie-dye day. Sweeney will be attending homecoming wearing her new shirt.
“The motivation to do tie-dye is to give it a little twist rather than [handing out] regular t-shirts,” said Alex Lopez, the Vice President of ACP and a Biomedical graduate student. Lopez also added that this tie dying is something they do throughout the academic year to promote upcoming campus events.
This was just one of several events of Spirit Week; the Gold Coast Cinema premiered “Think Like a Man Too,” and the annual Pep Rally was held outside in the new Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. If you’re interested in joining ACP they meet every Wednesday at 1 p.m. in the Gold Coast Cinema, for more information call 516-299-2800.

The Great Lawn Festival took place Thursday, Oct. 16, during common hour as a part of Spirit Week. However, due to bad weather, Campus Life Coordinator Matthew Blanar had no choice but to move the festival into The End Zone of Hillwood Commons.
Clearly, moving the event inside put restrictions on the games that were planned to be outdoors. Although it did not turn out as planned, people seemed to enjoy it. “This was a great start to get involved in Spirit Week,” said Evette Argyropoulos, a freshman undeclared major. Her friend Stephanie Menexas, a freshman Business Management major, agreed. “As a cheerleader, I like to see people getting involved [and] showing school spirit.” The girls liked the green and gold balloon decorations, and the music from the featured band, Trish Torrales & The Premier; however, the girls indicated that they would have liked to seen posters around campus informing students about the event.
Although a minority of students knew that there was a festival during common hour that day, Wolf German, a senior Sociology major, clearly knew about the concert that was going on. He and his friend were enjoying their lunch while listening to the band. “She [Trish Torrales] is a great singer. The band is excellent,” German said.
Trish Torrales & The Premier consists of members; Trish Torrales, lead vocals and rhythm guitar; Dylan Cotes, bass; Jimmy Loffler and Brian Watala, lead guitarists; and Rafe Tangorra, drums.
Other students that were unaware of the event still had a good time during the festival.
Dominick Mazliah, a freshman Biology major, and his friends from the Pioneer football team had not been given much information about the Great Lawn Festival, but otherwise enjoyed the event.
We are having a great time and especially enjoying the nice food; however, a suggestion for next year would be to make it a bit more visible to attract more students,” Mazliah said.

On Saturday, Oct. 18, before the homecoming game, The Pioneer student newspaper hosted its first alumni party, where current writers, editors, and photographers were able to mingle and network with former staff members of the paper. The alumni who attended, ranging from 1998 to 2012 graduates, were eager to see their old works and reminisce while looking through the newspaper archives.
Jarad Wilk (’01), former Managing Editor, Arts and Entertainment Editor and Columnist, recalled his days working on the paper as similar to his current job as a Sports Desk Editor and Columnist for The New York Post. “It’s much more strict now [at the NY Post]; however, [at The Pioneer], I could do whatever I wanted with my column, which I guess I still do,” he said with a smile. “But the days [for our staff] were long. We came in around 4 p.m. and often stayed until 6 in the morning,” Wilk said. He mentioned that his work on The Pioneer helped him understand deadlines, which helped prepare him for working with four each day at The New York Post.
“The room looks the same, only it’s a lot cleaner now,” said Michael Gonzales (’09). Gonzales was The Pioneer’s Arts and Entertainment Editor. He recalled sitting in one of the editing rooms watching Obama being elected for the first time while doing newspaper work. “We had a futon in there, and a TV we used to turn on with a paper clip,” he said, laughing while pointing into the editing room. “It’s still the same, but at the same time it [has] changed a lot. We used to draw on the walls! The two years I was an editor were great.”
Another alumni, Jeffrey Fisher (’98) who is currently a graduate student at Columbia, used the paper as a way to get more involved on campus. He mentioned that when he was on the staff, the paper was the only way of getting news, alongside television. “Our cell phones didn’t have Internet, so the paper seemed more important,” he said. He emphasized that it was not only important for experience in the workplace, but also for students reading it as a way to get news.
Jacqueline Favoloro (’12), who was the Co-Editor-in-Chief from 2011-2012, talked about The Pioneer’s impact on her life after graduating. She gave The Pioneer a lot of credit for preparing her for her current position as a writer for Kessler International, an investigation firm. “It showed that I could do a lot of stuff at the same time, with keeping deadlines and having to keep control over several things at [once],” Favoloro said. She now writes reports, blogs, and social media coverage for her company.
Media Arts Professor Julie Price and her PR 67 class assisted in organizing and running the alumni event. They decorated the newsroom, hanging streamers, filling baskets with Pioneer giveaways, and displaying old issues on the walls. “It’s nice to see successful alumni come here and talk and mingle with current writers and editors. I’m glad to host the event,” Price said.
“It’s exciting for current students to meet alumni and see what they do today, and I can imagine that it was nostalgic for the alumni to come back to the school and the Pioneer [news]room,” said Moa Golster, a junior Journalism major and an online editor.
Because of its success, The Pioneer hopes to plan future alumni events, and possibly make the Homecoming party an annual affair.

Imagine having the power to read everyone’s mind around you, and all that was needed was a free app on your phone. In 2014, this has become somewhat possible. The name of the app is Yik Yak, and it has raised some eyebrows on college campuses nationwide.
“Yik Yak acts like a local bulletin board for your area by showing the most recent posts from other users around you,” according to a description of the app in the iTunes store. “It allows anyone to connect and share information with others without having to know them.”
In other words, Yik Yak gives people the freedom to say whatever they want to whoever they want without revealing their identity. What is not mentioned in the app’s description is that all of the Yaks on the home screen come from within a 10 mile radius. Yaks can vary from funny jokes, to calling out individuals by what they are wearing, to complaining about professors, etc.
Yik Yak can also put people in an uncomfortable position. Students often Yak about other people in their classroom, usually describing how attractive they are. Yaks also let students air out their complaints about the campus or the school in general. In addition, some Yaks are hilarious comments about the life of a college student.
This app is being widely used by LIU Post students, one being Maximillian Bovin, a sophomore Film major, finds Yik Yak to be light- hearted entertainment. “I laugh at a lot of them,” Bovin said.
As a member of a fraternity, Bovin sees a decent amount of negative Yaks towards himself and his friends. “I’m not a sensitive person; those comments don’t offend me.”
Lauren Thomas, a senior Broadcast major, finds Yik Yak more than funny. “I spend a significant amount of time on it [Yik Yak]; it’s almost an addiction,” Thomas said. She first downloaded the app about a month ago out of curiosity to see what people were saying about her. Thomas’ only gripe about the app is its repetitive nature, and the confidence it gives people because of its anonymity. Thomas feels that people wouldn’t dare say what they post on Yik Yak in real life
Other students are not as positive about the app. Nicole Ryan, a sophomore Theater major, believes this app is not something to be toyed with. “It has a huge potential to be dangerous, if not used properly,” Ryan said. However, she also believes this app can be used for good—in case of an emergency—to spread information quickly.
Ironically, Media Arts Professor Nicole Stevens agrees with the informative capabilities of the app, although she does believe that the app itself is “bizarre,” and should not be used in her class.
Yik Yak launched in December of last year and has gained most of it popularity on college campuses, according to Foxnews.com. The anonymous factor gives way to some shocking, but mostly harmless comments, according to students like Bovin and Thomas. If you’re interested, download it for free and try it out for yourself.

When you enter the office of Benjamin ‘Benj’ Gerdes, an assistant professor of Media Arts, you feel as if you’ve stepped into the world of “Back to the Future,” where DeLoreans can transcend space and time. Gerdes is your resident Doc, without the crazy hair and lab coat. Although Gerdes isn’t developing a time- travelling car, he has a different innovation up his sleeve: a drone, which will be used for instructional purposes in his class Community Media Laboratory, included in the Spring 2015 schedule.
“The funds for the drone came from a previous teaching position [of mine] at Cooper Union in the School of Art where I was collaborating with an art historian,” Gerdes said. “We got a grant from the Menschel Teaching Fellowship, and that’s where the money for the drone came from. We were interested in tracing both the effects of drones in terms of how we visualize certain sights, conflicts, and issues, [and] also [the] broad history of aerial perspective.” The Menschel Teaching Fellowship, based at Cornell University, fosters a shared vision of teaching excellence at Cornell, and advances scholarly activities related to teaching and learning.
Gerdes explained his plans for the drone: “In the course, [we will] use [the drone] in an instructional setting, and see if there are ways that visual communication can be made more compelling [or] more effective by viewing things from an aerial perspective. Depicting overhead angles and things like that are kind of emerging possibilities for drone-use that are quite compelling to me, and that’s what I want to work with students to explore.” He continued, “Drones are one technology among many that we will be exploring in the course.”
The drone is a DJI Phantom 2 quad copter, which Gerdes specified would have a Go-Pro camera attached to the base of the craft in order to capture aerial images.
Gerdes expressed that he is aware of the negative implications associated with drone- use in recent history. “While I believe a good deal of regulatory oversight is clearly necessary regarding domestic drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have up to this point operated consistently in a legal gray area, and often much worse under international law. For example, reports from the United Nations, the Amnesty International, and the Human Rights Watch have all questioned the legality of U.S. military drone strikes in a series of separate reports in 2013. So, in some ways, the hazy legality of operating these, even on the level of consumer technology, seems built into the idea of the drone from the start: they are meant to do things people can’t do, and that’s what makes them both fascinating, useful, and potentially destructive as a technology.”
According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s article entitled, “The FAA Creates Thin Privacy Guidelines For The Nation’s First Domestic Drone ‘Test Sites,’” the Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act, issued by Senator Ed Markey (D – MA) in Nov. 2013, was intended to codify essential privacy and transparency requirements within the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) regulatory framework for domestic drones and drone test sites. Following this act’s passage, the FAA released privacy requirements for six drones’ “test sites” that the agency will use to evaluate how drones will be integrated into domestic air traffic.
“It’s probably useful to think about regulation in relationship to the FAA and telecommunications monopolies, as there is now a commercial drone lobby, and I think it’s important we continue to explore the possibilities for activism and citizen journalism that drones might allow us in the same way that low-power [college] radio and cable access were legislated to balance the major commercial broadcasters,” Gerdes continued.
Will Bruner, a junior Broadcasting major, believes the Community Media Lab will be an exciting addition to the regular curriculum at Post. “I would take the course because there’s really nothing on campus like it, and from what I’ve seen from Professor Gerdes in the past it’s sure to be fun and informative,” Bruner said.
Jake Scotto, a senior Broadcasting major, said, “So far, I have taken three of [Benj’s] classes, and he has been excellent. Not only is he exceptionally knowledgeable in his field, he constantly engages classes with either readings or video clips pertaining to our discussions.”
Gerdes believes the drone will allow students to take part in a heightened level of technological experimentation within topical coursework. “There are multiple methods of technology such as motion-controlled cameras and time-lapse videos that are emerging ways of communicating and telling stories, [but] I actually see the drone as the most different or esoteric of those techniques; students should be engaging with [this], not just as technologies, but as creative tools [as well].” He added, “One of my jobs as an instructor is to get people to think about how to reinvent or expand the definition of how stories can be told, and I think drones can play a role in that potentially.
“I think it is a terrific thing for our [department] that Professor Gerdes will be sharing this piece of technology with our students,” said Dr. Barbara Fowles, the chair of the Media Arts department. Fowles also clarified to The Pioneer that the drone was not purchased with any LIU Post budget.
“[The new] course will [teach] students the aesthetics, logistics, and journalistic possibilities opened to them through the use of this new technology. The use of the drone in the campus environment will also offer opportunities to explore the privacy [and] safety issues associated with this technology.” She continued, “It is vital for media arts students to learn the effective and appropriate use of new technologies for information-gathering. Students are very lucky to have
the chance to become comfortable with this cutting-edge technology, which is rapidly becoming part of the media landscape,” Fowles said.

It’s that time of year again! For some, fall is a depressing reminder that the summer is over and winter’s merciless snowstorms are on their way down the coast. But, for others, fall is a liberating time of year—one where tranquility can be found on a hiking trail surrounded in a whirlwind of whispering golden leaves.
Although my favorite season is summer, fall is a beautiful season to experience on the East Coast. Yes, the wind can be biting at times, turning pale cheeks red as tomatoes and frosting your car in the first signs of morning dewy freezes.

The cold doesn’t bother me, even though I spend most of my time outside during this season. It has been a tradition in my family since I was a little girl to go camping during Columbus Day weekend. It’s usually our way of starting off the new season. We would pack thermal sleeping bags, smart wool clothing, polar fleeces, hats, gloves, hot cocoa, and camping foods, and make our way to upstate New York. Let me just say, upstate New York during the fall is serene and spectacular. Get a campsite on a lake surrounded by turning foliage and you have a million dollar view.
When I was a little girl, I would bring my Barbie dolls camping, creating a makeshift tent and throwing them into the lake, attached by just a string to pull them back to shore. Now that I’ve grown up, I don’t need any sort of entertainment on these trips. All you need during fall camping is hiking boots and maybe a book. Hiking the trails of the Catskill and Adirondack mountains is one of the most beautiful experiences. Your feet crunch the colorful yet frail leaves that blanket the ground; some trees are luscious with radiating, vibrant shades of orange, red, and yellow, while other trees are barren, offering you a beautiful view of what is to come just around the bend. No one else is usually out—no animals, no people. It is quiet and peaceful, and you really feel like you are the only one left on the planet. But it is a good feeling, because you get to think, relax, and soak up the last rays of sun.
When you’re not hiking, you can be canoeing or kayaking across the lake, taking pictures of the changing foliage from the water (a beautiful and uniquely different perspective) and visiting hidden islands. Since my dad and I are both into photography, we usually take trips
up in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine to photograph the foliage. Every year the leaves change differently, making every fall experience one-of-a-kind.
By the end of the day, the sun sets over the lake and you are surrounded by nothing more than your loved ones and a warm fire. Roast some marshmallows, tell stories, and your fall experience is like none you’ve ever had before. Fall is the time to explore nature and its exquisite beauties. Don’t sit around indoors when you could be outside marveling at vibrant colored trees and peaceful mountain trails. The leaves don’t stay golden forever. Time is fleeting, and I think fall is the fastest season. Seize the moment and enjoy the season while you can!

Every year, many students count down the days until homecoming weekend, expecting to have a great time with their fellow Pioneers. Usually, this is the case and homecoming weekend is one for the books. From the pep rally and the tailgating to the game, it’s overall an exciting few days in a college student’s career. However, the question on everybody’s mind this year was: “Will this year be as much fun?”
This year, there were many changes being made to the homecoming weekend agenda. Last year, each club and organization on campus held a table outside of the football stadium during the game to promote their club. These clubs sometimes even sold baked good and other things, as well. Unfortunately, many clubs were not permitted to have these tables this year. Apparently, only a few organizations and clubs were selected to set up their tables at the game. No one I spoke with was absolutely sure why certain clubs weren’t allowed to have tables this year, but it is very selective now. Personally, I don’t think anyone should be turned away from holding his or her club table. It’s an awesome way to promote for the club and bring in freshmen and new members.
Also, there was no homecoming after-party on campus this year. Last year, a few clubs joined together to hold a homecoming night party at the Pratt Recreation Center. This was convenient for a number of reasons; because many people attended this party, there was a seemingly significant less chance of students drinking and driving to get to after- events; It also kept everyone in one place for most of the night, so that there was no sporadic craziness all over campus. This year, no clubs or students had permission to host a party anywhere on campus. I don’t think it’s beneficial.
With all of this being said, us Pioneers make our own fun at homecoming regardless. I urge students of all ages to get involved in all of the events, espcially the pep rally. Pep rally is underrated, for sure, with its performances, great music, and the opportunity to meeting with some of Post’s ahletes!

The Archives and Special Collections located in room 345 (second floor) of LIU Post’s B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library serves as a large, dynamic resource for students, faculty, and the public. With more than 35 distinguished rare book and archival collections, from books, manuscripts, and journals, to photographs, drawings, and posters, a great deal of history can be found. Senior Library Assistant and Juvenile Collection Curator, Jarron Jewell, spoke about the Special Collections mission.
“We have a mandate to serve the academic community, but special collections also serve the local community in a very special way,” said Jewell. “We have a lot of patrons from the local community that come and use the collections.” Jewell works closely with Special Collections Secretary Heather Hesse and under Valeda F. Dent, Dean of University Libraries.
“Everybody says ‘oh, all the rare books are in special collections! Those old, musty books,” said Jewell. “But in fact, special collections
is a very dynamic place.” The majority of materials are from an accumulation of donations from the collections of generous individuals, as well as directly from the school, like every issue of The Pioneer newspaper and the Opticon yearbook ever printed.
“It’s not a museum,” continued Jewell. “We are continually taking in new materials that are donations either in individual items or [as] collections. We exhibit. We can share in exhibitions. We do presentations. We collaborate in classroom activities with different disciplines, like graduate interns.”
Most interns are from the Palmer School of Library and Information Science, part of the LIU network, with courses at LIU Post, Brentwood, and NYU’s Bobst Library, as well as online. “I train [these students] throughout the semester, and then they go off to become archivists or librarians,” explained Jewell. Interns develop hands-on learning, caring for new materials, digitizing the collection, and working with Jewell and Hesse in expansions.
The American Juvenile Collection, which Jewell directly manages, houses thousands of research materials, such as illustrations, photographs, correspondences, and first edition copies of 20th century children’s books. Jewell stressed the importance of preserving materials within a historical context, and that one may be hard-pressed to find the same books they read as a child in a modern bookstore. “If you went back now, unless it’s a longtime classic, you wouldn’t find [the same] book now, because children’s books turn over very quickly these days. They’re harder to find,” she said.
“[The collection is] tremendously great for deep research,” said Jewell. “Last year we got an additional 1,500 book donation from [the] Suffolk County Library Association, and two retired librarians who were curating our collection. Now we are building a 20th century collection of children’s books [with those contributions].”
Another collection is the Original Movie Poster Research Collection, composed of some 6,000 posters, mostly from the years between 1940 and 1962. The posters were hung in theaters, and are exhibited on a yearly basis. “We have a lot of activity with the movie posters,” said Jewell. Graphic art students are often given assignments to design their own movie posters, and reference the collection to inform their work. Displays are currently held in the hall outside of Special Collection, showcasing Shocktober Thrillers like “The Werewolf” (1956) and “The Pit and the Pendulum” (1961).
Other highlights from the Special Collections include the Archives of George Bernard Shaw Theatre Programs, the Joan and John Digby Private Press Collections, the Cedar Swamp Historical Society Collection, the Winthrop Palmer French and Irish Literature Collection, the Karl Otto Paetel Beat Generation Collection, the Theodore Roosevelt Association Collection, and more.
There are necessary restrictions for those who wish to view materials, including a policy of only being able to view them in the Rare Book Room under departmental regulations. A phone or email ahead of time is advised. “It is an area where you can’t take materials out,” said Jewell. “It’s called closed stacks, downstairs [in the main library] they’re open stacks. Here you come and we have a reading room. That’s where people do their research.”
For more information, Jewell can be reached at at 516-299-3407, or at her email jarron.jewell@liu.ediu to schedule an appointment.

“Make sure you keep in contact with me and your mum, okay?” “Yeah, yeah, course I will!” Eight weeks into this tremendously adventurous journey, and I have begun the “drifting away” stage. This is where students, sons and daughters, who have moved away from home, begin to stop contacting their parents through calls, Skype/FaceTime or texting. Yes, I am guilty of this horrendous crime (believed by parents), and in this week’s column, I want to explore whether this is a common “tradition” in the life of an international student, or whether others do not succumb to it, keeping structured times and dates to talk to their parents.
In the early stages of my move to the U.S., I was speaking to my dad a lot throughout each day, to let him know how it was, what I was doing, how I was feeling, and also to see if he is doing okay. International students have to remember that losing a son or a daughter that you have seen every day since they were tiny, cute, and helpless; seeing them grow up and change and watch their life evolve, is extremely difficult for a parent. So initially they might be finding it just as hard as you do in this new place, even though they aren’t with you.
This is particularly the case for my dad. I was the only son out of three that lived with him, so we have a really good relationship. When I left, there wasn’t anyone in the house to banter with him, drive him crazy, and “borrow” money. Although these examples sound strange to miss, they’re not. If you think about it, these factors are the things that make you a son or daughter. These are the things that they have loved (and hated). When you leave to follow and pursue a dream (which they get and want you to do, by the way) their lives can become extremely hard—and so it was for my dad. The reason I know this is because I “used” to talk to him, and see how I put “used”? This is because now that I have settled in, and have essays to write, exams to study for, and games to play, I feel like I don’t have to talk to him as much.
Last Wednesday when I was in the Pratt, my dad messaged me, saying, “Hiya, son, I am sending the stuff from home you wanted me to send. However, the courier needs you to sign it off, so where are you now and I will get him to drop it there?” I was hitting up the gym (obviously to get huge and improve on my already big chest), so I messaged him back, saying, “Yeah drop it at the Pratt Center and I will look out the window for it.” The plan was set and I was going to have to take this great big box of stuff on the shuttle home with me, and then walk from the Hicksville station to my house… Great! (This is what I was thinking.)
After about 20 minutes of this exchange of text messages, I went out of the gym and checked for the courier men or packages at the reception, but there weren’t any. I have a quick turn of the head towards the doors… turn back and then think, “Wait… WTF!?” turn back to the doors and see my bro and dad struggling through with their luggage and bags! It was like fate, like someone had told me to go out of the gym at that point. I didn’t know whether I was ecstatic, sentimental, sad, or shocked. But I think I was all of these emotions. Such a weird feeling. Over the four days that they were here, it gave me a good sense of calm, but also a feeling of sadness and sorrow. These were feelings that I had bottled up, subconsciously, without knowing, and had just gone on with my new life.
This brings me to why I have told this story. Although you guys, at this point, don’t feel as though you have to talk to your parents all the time, it’s good for your psyche to get things off your chest to the best listeners around—your parents. There may be things to worry about— exams, essays, day-to-day life, money, it could even be happiness about exam results, accomplishments, or developing skills. Not only do you get a sense of relief and reward by sharing these things, your parents do, as well. The sense of joy they must get when they hear that their offspring have done something great must be phenomenal, and I can’t wait to experience it with my kids.
So, I encourage you to talk to your parents. I am not demanding that you talk to them every minute of every day, and it doesn’t have to be a long phone call or a scheduled on-the-dot Facetime. No, it can just be a text or Whatsapp saying, “Hey, mum/dad, had a good/bad day, don’t like this, this, and this. How are you today?” That’s all they want; just to make sure that you—their beloved son or daughter—is okay. So, after this column is published and you guys are reading it, I want to see loads of phones being taken out and used for sentimental reasons (maybe a few tears), to have a good chat with your parents.

Rebecca (Academy Award Winner Juliette Binoche) is a photojournalist who reports on the dangerous daily lives of people in war zones. Her latest assignment documents female suicide bombers in Afghanistan, who let her observe and study their preparations. Putting herself in harms way, Rebecca barely survives a street-side explosion, returns home to her family in Ireland, and is riddled with guilt since she may have been able to stop those events from happening. But even the confrontations from her husband Marcus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and the distance between her and her daughters does not keep Rebecca from the temptation to return to the field to expose injustice.
“1,000 Times Good Night” was written and directed by Erik Poppe, a Norwegian filmmaker who spent a large portion of his early career as a photographer covering international conflicts all over the world. Poppe discovered the hardships of such a job; not only in the field, but the toll it takes back home in family life. That experience penetrates this film in a very honest way. Characters make dumb mistakes and irrational decisions that may seem jarring at first to the audience, but ultimately feel real, as they convey human imperfection.
The dialogue in the film could use some shaping, but the sudden emotional outbursts from certain characters are rationalized through the lens of family. Ever not hear from a loved one for a few hours, get worried, and snap at them for making you feel that way? This notion of anger, from worry and love, is an important part of the story.
Coster-Waldau (you know, Jaime Lannister from “Game of Thrones”) is a standout in the film, utilizing his real, deep Danish voice as Marcus, rather than the accented voices he is known for in more of his mainstream work. Here, he is a master of passive-aggressive whispers that reveal a deep exasperated love for his wife. Binoche counters with equal acting finesse, depicting Rebecca as both a flawed and caring
mother.Imagery of sheets, curtains, and other transparent fabrics emphasize the blurred ethics in the story. Rebecca’s daughter Steph (Lauryn Canny) proposes accompanying her mother on a new assignment to Kenya, showing an interest in the photographic work,
and as a means to re-connect. Of course, tragedy strikes on their trip and their relationship, and the family unit is plunged back into tense cold water. One scene, in which Rebecca speaks to her daughter from behind a mosquito net, further emphasizes the gaps forming between the characters, and the strains developing within their relationship.
Other than a few brief surrealistic dream-sequences, Poppe focuses his characterization and symbolism on real action and, more importantly, the setting. There is a fantastic sense of danger as Rebecca travels in the Middle East and elsewhere, that plays with the Western mind and all of the fears that rarely are seen firsthand, and often seen through the media (think, ISIS).
The film falls into danger of sticking itself in the category of stretched-out family drama, but finds redemptions by injecting an appropriate amount of action and tension. With few shortfalls, other than perhaps a hint of moralizing themes, this is a refreshing and relevant film with a well-built international cast.
“1,000 Times Goodnight” opens Oct. 24 in limited theatrical release and video-on-demand.
Verdict: A-

On Tuesday, Oct. 14, men’s soccer (10-3-1) took the field against the Golden Lions (7-5-1) from Dowling College in Brookville, N.Y. The Pioneers were able to pull out the 2-1 victory, pushing their win streak to a season-high of five games.
The Pioneers and the Golden Lions started their ECC match-up with both sides fighting to gain the upper hand in an early, scoreless deadlock. Both teams were quick on their counter attacks, as they moved the ball deep into each other’s boxes. At the end of the first half, Dowling outshot the Pioneers 6-5, while the Pioneers held an 8-3 advantage in corner kicks. The advantages for both teams did not translate to the scoreboard in the first half, as both teams were knotted at zero.
The Green and Gold managed to break the scoreless tie in the second half when junior forward Alfred Lindberg corralled a blocked shot in front of the net and buried his second goal of the season. Roughly four minutes later, Dowling responded with a goal from senior midfielder Jose Herrera, who managed to take advantage of a Pioneer turnover just outside the box.
In the 69th minute, junior midfielders Alex Billington and Matias Ruiz combined for the go-ahead and eventual game-winning goal; Ruiz sent a precise pass off a corner kick and Billington seized the opportunity, giving his team the 2-1 lead. The Pioneers were able to outshoot their opponents 16-10 and maintain a solid edge in the corner kicks at 13-3, illustrating their time of possession prowess.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Oct. 18, when they traveled to Pennsylvania to face off against the Rams from Philadelphia University (10-4-1) in a non-conference tilt. The Pioneers were powered by junior goalkeeper Jesper Malmstrom who made four saves to earn his sixth shutout of the season.
Although the first half featured no goals, the Pioneers outshot the Rams by three and held an 8-3 advantage in corner kicks. The Pioneer defense continued their terrific play in the second half, limiting the opposition to just two shots on goal. Looking to grab the lead late in the game, graduate midfielder Tom Bowen struck the ball from over 20 yards out and found the back of the net for the one and only tally of the contest. The 1-0 win for LIU pushed their win streak to six games. During that span, the Pioneers outscored their opponents 10-3.
Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and his squad are back in action on Wednesday, Oct. 22, when they play host to the Post University Eagles. Kickoff is set for 3.30 p.m.

The LIU Post field hockey team entered Friday’s match on the back of a hard fought 4-2 victory against Southern Connecticut State on Tuesday, Oct. 14. The trip up to Massachusetts on Friday, Oct. 17 to face Northeast-10 foes Stonehill (8-1) ended in a nailbiting 3-2 loss.
Stonehill, who sit in second place in the Ne-10 with a conference record of 3-0, got the scoring underway after 16 minutes. The Pioneers pulled one back late in the first half to ensure the contest was still up for grabs.
However, just a few minutes after the half time break, the Skyhawks put one away to regain the lead. Just as the Pioneers were beginning to look dangerous enough to pull one back, the Skyhawks struck again, putting the game further from grasp.
“At half time with the score at 1-1 we really believed we could win the game,” sophomore defender Abi Sawyer said. “We had been playing well and creating chances. I think the entire locker room shared the belief we could win.”
Throughout the entire second half, it was the Pioneers who had momentum and kept pushing forward to try and level the game up. But as time ticked on, the Pioneers squandered some big goal-scoring opportunities, which allowed Stonehill to keep hold of its two-goal lead. Despite its best efforts, LIU only managed to snatch a consolation goal in the final minute of play, which saw the game finish 3-2.
Senior forward Stephanie Ruhle scored two on the afternoon, but added this about the team’s performance: “The most frustrating thing is that we played well, we had the chances to at least tie the game, if not win it.”
The Pioneers are back in action again on Sunday, Oct. 26, when they return home to play Bentley University. Game time is set for 11 a.m.

On Wednesday, Oct. 15, women’s soccer came away with a 2-2 tie in its last home appearance of the regular season. Long time school rival Dowling College forced the battle through rain and wind to an overtime thriller, where none of the teams could make way for the decider.
The Pioneers came from a ten-win streak, and had earned a 25th spot on the National Soccer Coaches Association of America’s Division II ranking. And it started off in the Pioneers’ favor this chilly weekday afternoon.
Junior forward Susanne Vistnes connected with a cross from junior back Katie LaManna and found the back of the net after 27 minutes of play, which introduced an intense seven minutes to come.
The Golden Lions quickly answered after a battle in the Pioneer box where Kelly McQuail broke free and rolled the ball passed sophomore goalkeeper Hreffie Agnarsdottir.
However the Dowling fans on the stands barely had time to sit down before Vistnes smelled the scent of goal again. It took her less than two minutes to respond to the equalizer, as she created a path past the Dowling defender and blasted a strike that the keeper could not hold.
Senior back Rebecca Swedberg bossed over the defensive line for the remainder of the half, and the Pioneers could hold off from another equalizer before half time.
In the second stanza, the Golden Lions came out hungry, and got an opportunity early on to get even. In minute 54, Dowling set up for
a corner that was curled into the box to find the head of McQuail. She steered it into the top right corner, which evened the score and meant her second tally of the game.
The 2-2 score did stand for the remainder of the half, despite attempts on both ends to secure the win. Agnarsdottir recorded three saves for the Pioneers, while the Dowling keeper saved two.
After a shotless first overtime session, the game was to be decided in the last ten minutes. Both teams had chances to get the win; the
last one to put it away was given to the Pioneers, when senior forward Lauren Bellone made her way behind the defense but got the ball hooping away from her feet in the killer moment.
On Monday, Oct. 20, the Pioneers hit the road to face Philadelphia University for a top-dog clash on its narrow, bumpy grass field. The game was bouncing back and forth, and the game statistics showed even numbers in shot attempts and corner kicks; however, both teams were also unable to find the net—until the last minute.
In a late offensive scoop, the visitors stringed some passes together that eventually landed before Vistnes’ feet in the box. She managed to direct the ball in with a toe, and save the day for the Green and Gold.
The three points might become decisive in the favor of Head Coach Mark Dawson and his team, as they race for a spot in the National tournament. The Pioneers will continue on the road to wrap up the season, with four more away trips waiting. Next up will be Mercy College on Saturday, Oct. 25, with the kick-off set for noon.

The LIU Post women’s volleyball squad (13-8) returned to action on Thursday, Oct. 16 when they played East Coast Conference rival Mercy College (4-17). The Pioneers made quick work of the Mavericks, defeating them in three sets at the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y. on “Dig Pink” night. The event is a national breast cancer rally that is orchestrated by collegiate volleyball teams from around the country.
The Pioneers jumped out to an 8-5 advantage in the first set, but extended their lead by securing five of the next seven points. The combination of junior setter Monica Amador and freshman middle blocker Danielle Valenza contributed three aces to the run for the Green and Gold. The Pioneers cruised to a 25-15 first set victory. The second set was a lot closer, as both sides were deadlocked at nine. With momentum hanging in the balance, the Pioneers ceased the opportunity and went on a 6-1 spurt to go ahead 15-10 in the set. The Mavericks fought back, though, cutting the deficit to 17-15 at one point, but LIU stayed composed and closed out the set on an 8-2 run. Valenza provided two kills, including the set winner during that span.
The final set featured a combined 19 ties and eight lead changes, as neither side seemed to be able to grab the upper hand. The back-and- fourth battle in the third set had its final tie at 23 apiece, until Valenza earned match point for her team. The Mavericks however, kept the game going for a short while with a kill. Two points later, the hosts earned their fourth straight victory as they clinched the deciding set 26-24.
Graduate outside hitter Katie Hudencial notched the match-winning kill. Freshman middle blocker Heather Ball had two aces and a pair of blocks to go with her staggering .450 hit percentage on the day. Sophomore middle hitter Analise Austin accumulated eight digs and two aces, while junior middle hitter Melissa Hansen recorded six kills.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Oct. 18, when they battled with the Knights from Queens College (8-10). The Pioneers cruised to a 3-0 victory, which was their second straight shutout, their fourth shutout in their last five matches, and their fifth straight win overall.
In the first set, LIU was powered by two separate spurts on offense. A 6-2 run early on and a 6-1 run to close out the set by the Pioneers set the tone for the match. In a tightly contested second set that saw eight ties and three lead changes, the two sides needed extra points to decide a set winner. The visitors came out on top, due in part to a key block from senior middle blocker Heather Adams to help secure the 27- 25 win.
The third and final set was dominated by the Pioneers, as they went up 11-6 and never looked back. The closest the Knights came after that point in time was four points.
Head Coach Shellane Ogoshi and her team are back in action on Thursday, Oct. 23, when they play host to the Lions from Molloy College. First serve is scheduled for 6 p.m.

The LIU Post football team (5-2) erupted for seven offensive touchdowns Saturday, Oct. 18, in a 49-21 blowout of Saint Anselm on homecoming at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. Red-shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino had a hand in every Pioneer score, passing for four touchdowns and rushing for three. Laurino broke the record for most touchdowns in a game for the Pioneers with seven.
The Green and Gold had total control of the game from the opening kickoff. On their first possession, Laurino had a one-yard push into the end zone, giving the Pioneers a 7-0 lead. Two plays prior, the Boise-native hooked up with red-shirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Ward on a 21-yard strike, which set up shop at the Saint Anselm (5-2) five-yard line.
A fumble recovery by red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti set up a one-yard run by Laurino, giving the hosts a 14-0 lead. The Hawks responded and cut the deficit in half as senior wide receiver Justin Bernard hauled in a 6-yard touchdown catch. However, the Pioneers kept their foot on the gas as they fired back with 14 unanswered points to gain a 28-7 advantage heading into halftime. Laurino connected with junior tight end Sean Binckes for both scores.
LIU Post never slowed down as they continued to have success on both sides of the ball. Saint Anselm did manage to a score a quick touchdown to open up the third quarter as sophomore quarterback Yianni Gavalas threw a 23-yard pass to senior wide receiver Ahkeen Williams  to reduce the gap to 28-14.
After having their lead sliced in half again, the Pioneers tacked on 14 consecutive points to put the game out of reach. The first of the two scores was a result of an eight-yard screen pass from Laurino to red-shirt sophomore Mike Williams. Laurino’s elusiveness kept the drive alive after scampering for 13 yards on a third-and-10. On the next drive, Laurino pieced together a 10-play, 63-yard series that culminated in a Laurino three-yard rush into the end zone making it a 42-14 game.
The Green and Gold rounded out their scoring on their first drive of the fourth quarter. Laurino found red-shirt senior receiver Kamron Palmer in the middle of the end zone for the touchdown.
The fifth-year senior completed 31-of-51 passes for 346 yards, adding 77 net rushing yards to his outstanding performance. Williams rushed for 68 yards on nine carries. Binckes caught eight passes for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Red-shirt sophomore wideout Shane Hubbard chipped in with six receptions for 76 yards while Palmer hauled in seven balls for 68 yards and a score.
Defensively, Brunetti racked up a game-high 13 tackles, two of which came for a loss, and forced a fumble. “Trusting the game plan and trusting Coach Collins was the key to winning this game. Film also plays a big part of our success and it helps keep us one step ahead,” said Brunetti.
Senior defensive back Roger Hamilton had 11 tackles, one forced fumble and a pass deflection. Red-shirt junior linebacker Brandon Cheney recorded nine stops. Junior defensive back Jhaleel Oswald made seven tackles, while coming up with an interception and breaking up three passes.
“To keep winning, we need to stop giving up the big play and be more consistent on special teams coverage,” said Collins. “We need to continue to mature, deal with success and make sure we don’t become too complacent and stay hungry. I’m also very proud of how well we’ve dealt with adversity.” He continued, “To keep winning, we need to stop giving up the big play and be more consistent on special teams coverage.”
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers return to action next Saturday, Oct. 25th when they square off against NE-10 foe American International in the third and final game of their home stand in a battle for first place atop the league standings. Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m.
