The NBA season kicked off on Tuesday, Oct.19, and the landscape of the league might not look how many would have expected it. Teams predicted to be at the top of their conferences have struggled, while some teams have blown away expectations in the early going. 
One team that has caught some fans off guard is the Golden State Warriors.
Junior broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher has very high expectations for Golden State.  
“I think the Warriors have the most well-rounded team in the NBA,” he said. 
Boettcher believes that the Nets likely have the most star power and that the two teams should be considered the “main championship contenders” in their respective conferences. The Warriors, who are in first place in the West ahead of the surging Phoenix Suns and the Utah Jazz, are now expecting star Klay Thompson to return before Christmas Day, according to The Athletic.
Other success stories have come as a surprise to fans.
“Some teams that have surprised me have been the Cavaliers with the great play from Evan Mobley, and then the Wizards with their subtraction of Westbrook for Dinwiddie and many Lakers role players,” Boettcher said.
The third pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, Evan Mobley, is an early contender for rookie of the year and has been better than expected. Cleveland has had a better record than most would have predicted at the start of the year, in part due to the addition of veteran point guard Ricky Rubio.
It hasn’t all been positive. Boettcher expressed there are some teams underperforming their abilities.
“A team that has disappointed me has to be the Timberwolves. This season was really the first time their main core have been healthy together, and they have been underwhelming,” Boettcher said.
While second-year guard Anthony Edwards has raised his scoring to 23 points per game, star center Karl-Anthony Towns has not taken the next step as a leader that many Timberwolves fans would have liked to see in order to make Minnesota a serious contender.
The hometown New York Knicks face questions about their rotation, as their bench lineup is one of the most effective in the NBA while the starters have struggled to build chemistry. The bench lineup features five returning players in Derrick Rose, Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, and Taj Gibson, while the starters have struggled to incorporate new additions Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier.

The Long Island University Women’s Hockey team is on an undefeated streak with an 8-0 record in the NEWHA (New England Women’s Hockey Alliance), following their two wins against St.Anselm College over the weekend 5-1 on Friday, Nov.19, and then again on Saturday, winning a thriller 3-2 on an overtime goal from Maggie Culp. The Sharks were were projected as the favorite to win the conference in the NEWHA’s preseason coaches poll. 
The Sharks are pushing forward with positive energy as they keep their eyes on a third straight NEWHA championship. LIU cruised to victory over their conference opponents such as Sacred Heart, Saint Michael’s and Post University.
Freshman defenseman Bri Eid believes Yale will be a big matchup to test this team. 
“I think our biggest competition coming up is Yale. That’s our next non-conference opponent, and I think it would be huge for us if we could take two points from them,” she said.
The team is remaining positive and working hard to finish the season. The girls said they find it easy to stay positive while playing good hockey and seeing the results pay off. The mindset among the team is to keep practicing hard and continue to build from recent games. 
Junior forward Matilda Af Bjur has very high expectations for herself and the team overall. 
“My mindset for this season is pretty much the same as the start of it. Giving it my all every day to make myself and the team better so we can leave everything on the ice and be proud of our season when it is over,” she said.
It is not uncommon for women’s hockey to earn weekly awards or highlights due to their high offensive statistics and defense. Freshman goalie Tindra Holm was named Rookie of the Week twice this season. Junior Abby Latorella was named NEWHA Player of the Week with goals in each of their two games against Maine right before the start of conference play. Freshman Jeanie Wallner has shined in her first collegiate season, ranking second on the team with 9 points, all of which have come during conference play. She was named NEWHA Rookie of the Week and Player of the Week once each. Af Bjur is a huge asset to the team. In the 2019-20 season, she played in all 32 games and led the team with 14 assists. She also led the team last year in points and goals.
Af Bjur is extremely excited for the opportunity to win another conference championship.
“It would really mean a lot to win a third championship. Being a third-year program and already coming this far is amazing and a championship win at the end of a season makes all the hard work worth it in the end,” she said. “I also think this third championship win will mean a lot more than the other two as this proves that we are ready for the next step and want to go further than just winning our conference. We want to compete against the big teams for the big title.” 
The big title in reference is the NCAA Women’s Hockey National Tournament, which currently encompasses 8 of the 41 eligible schools. LIU has not yet been voted in to compete in the tournament, but another conference title, as well as strong play against upcoming non-conference opponents, could change all of that.

The Islanders are back on Long Island, playing in UBS Arena in Elmont, NY. The stadium opened on Saturday, Nov. 20 for the first home Islanders game of the season against the Calgary Flames. 
The Islanders played their first 13 games on the road before the long awaited opening matchup, and now get to enjoy their new home base for the remainder of the 2021-22 season. 
The Islanders played all their home games from 1972 to 2015 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial coliseum in Uniondale, NY. Due to its age and conditioning, the Islanders moved their home games to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, which became the home of the Brooklyn Nets just a few years prior. 
This move did not go as well as planned for Islanders, as many fans complained about the seating and view arrangements at Barclays due to the design geared towards basketball. Another problem was the location. The main base for the Islanders fans is here in Nassau County, so the commute whether driving or public transit was much less convenient for the casual fan.
In 2018, the Islanders decided to split their home games between Barclays and the newly renovated Nassau Coliseum. 
On August 8, 2019, the Empire State Development Corporation board (ESD) voted unanimously in favor of the Belmont Park Arena project. The Islanders continued the two-stadium split of home games, until the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs. 
After being the home of Islanders games since their founding, the Islanders decided to play all the home playoff games in Nassau Coliseum, to commemorate all the history the franchise has had over the years, and give the old arena one final chance to be a heart to Islanders fans on their quest to a Stanley cup title. 
The Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in Round 1, and then the Boston Bruins in Round 2, each in six games. They would fall in the semi finals to the Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games. The Islanders took game six of that series in 3-2, on an overtime goal from Anthony Beauvillier, making an electric final game in Nassau Coliseum’s history, sending the Islanders into game seven, where they eventually fell 1-0 to Tampa Bay on the road. 
After nearly two long years and over $1 billion in funding, UBS Arena is finally open for fans to watch Islanders games with an attendance capacity of just over 17,000. Concerts held at the arena will hold a capacity of 18,500. 
Senior broadcasting major Joe Lonegro is a lifelong Islanders fan, and currently interns with MSG Network.
Lonegro could not be more excited for the next chapter of Islanders history. 
“From a fans perspective it’s amazing to finally know they are home and not going anywhere,” he said. “For my entire life there’s always been questions about relocation or which arena we’d play in, but for the first time that I’ve ever seen, we have stability.”
Lonegro was in attendance, working behind the scenes at the first home game against Calgary, where the Islanders fell 5-2. Despite the outcome, Lonegro ensures it will be a day he will never forget. 
“The atmosphere at the first game was electric. I had the privilege of watching people come in for the first time,” he said. 
Lonegro is certain that this is just the beginning for Islanders fans, and the new era of hockey and this opening year at UBS Arena will be one to remember.
“Seeing everyone so excited and happy was amazing to see,” he said. “People were fired up all night and it’ll continue for sure throughout the season.”

Apple (AAPL)
Apple has seen tremendous growth over the past few weeks, hitting its all time high on Monday, Nov.22. Apple is the largest company in the world with a market capitalization of $2.64 Billion. Apple currently sits at $161 a share and has been one of the fastest growing companies for decades and encompasses products that will be continuously used for generations to come. 
NIO(NIO)
NIO is a major Electric Vehicle company out of China. NIO sells primarily in Asia, and is increasing in subsidies in Europe and North America. If NIO gets full contracts with American distributors, the value of the stock value will skyrocket due to all the added markets and potential easy reach to consumers around the world. NIO currently has a stock value of $42 per share and a market cap of $66.87 Billion. These values have fluctuated a lot for a long time due to the volatility of the news market and mostly speculation on the future of the company. However, as sales start to explode and the feasibility of production and exportation of cars increase, so will the share value. 
W.W. Grainger(GWW) 
Grainger is an industrial supply company with a selection of 1.6 million options. Grainger has been a publicly traded company for over 25 years, and almost a century of operation of continuously being a leader in the industry.

Cardano(ADA) 
Cardano has been taking a tumble and downturn in recent weeks, however, this seems just to be a small sample size of time where many will take advantage and buy the drop. Cardano is a much more eco-friendly cryptocurrency as compared to other options. It is specifically 1.6 million times more energy efficient than bitcoin, which makes it a great alternative, as well as the total cap of coins being 45 billion, as compared to bitcoin which is 21 million. Cardano hit an all time high of $3.10 back in September, and with that was the third largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap only behind bitcoin and ethereum. Today, Cardano sits at $1.71 per coin, with a market cap of $57 Billion, good for 6th on the crypto charts.

Taylor Swift has released her second re-recorded album as part of her “Taylor’s Version” project. 
“Red (Taylor’s Version)” was released on Friday Nov. 12, and earned the singer her fourth number one in four months, according to Billboard. 
Swift is on a mission to re-record all of her old music that is under the ownership of Scooter Braun, an executive that refuses to relinquish rights to earlier tracks. Without the ownership of this music, Swift does not get the primary earnings from streams of the songs and albums.
Once Swift finishes re-recording all of her music, she will be the sole and primary owner of her music. 
“Red is about to be mine again, but it has always been ours. Tonight we begin again,” Swift said in an Instagram post the day of the album release. 
“Red (Taylor’s Version)” features every original re-recorded track from the first “Red” album, as well as eight never before heard “(From The Vault)” tracks, and a 10 minute version of the song, “All Too Well.”
The “(From The Vault)” songs are ones that Swift wrote during the time of the original album recording, but ultimately felt as though they did not have a place on the album. Nine years later, the songs have made their debut. 
The album has made 605,000 sales in its first week, and has been streamed 303 million times. Students on campus account for a number of those streams. 
“It was very inspiring to listen to “Red (Taylor’s Version)” after listening to the original for so long. It’s inspiring to see her finally taking back her music and owning it for herself,” senior musical theatre major Sophie Quinoñes said.
Quionoñes is a long time fan of Swift’s, and has been listening to the album nonstop since it’s Friday release. 
Quionoñes and other students have grown up with Swift, and she has become a sense of familiarity and comfort.
“Red was one of the first albums I ever owned the actual CD of as a preteen, and it’s so exciting to get to re-experience it now as an adult. It feels like Taylor and I are reminiscing about this period of our lives together,” senior musical theatre major Ellie Lauthner said.
Quionoñes and Lauthner have been listening to Swift’s last re-recorded album, “Fearless (Taylor’s version)” since it was released in April. They are both excited to have a new album to dive into.
“My favorite song on the album is “All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)” because it really just goes to show how talented of a musician she is,” Quinoñes said. 
The song, “All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)” was accompanied by a short film starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O’Brien. Fans have speculated that Swift wrote the story to mirror events and relationships in her life, though the singer has not confirmed any theories. 
“It’s always interesting to hear about celebrity gossip and things like that. I think it’s a little ridiculous that people are making this about her past love life. She’s just trying to own her own music again,” Quinoñes said.
Swift has always had a trail of investigative fans following her attempting to piece together every clue she drops. Her web of clues is extremely difficult to piece together as she has admitted her life is planned two years in advance.
“Swifties are notorious for being master sleuths and digging into every detail of Taylor’s public persona to find out secrets and Easter eggs, and she has encouraged that and said she really enjoys it. Some people take it really far and then it stops being fun,” Lauthner said.
Swifties have been able to predict certain Swift events and announcements, but not always. Some fans are speculating that “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” will be announced next, but only one person will ever know what is in store for the fandom next. 
Keep an eye out for future “Taylor’s Version” albums coming soon…maybe.

There are an estimated 17 million veterans in the United States, and Promise sought to honor them last week in recognition of Veterans Day. The first of the two events was Tuesday, Nov 9 with Letters for Veterans, followed by the Veterans Day Flag Raising Ceremony on Thursday, Nov 11.
“Letters for Veterans is an important thing to do for Veterans Day,” Linus Chun of LIu Promise said. “We have people who have served our country and I think even a simple letter is a powerful message. The event, in which students volunteer to write letters to veterans of the United States Armed forces, required less outreach than most Promise events as many students were eager to show their gratitude.”
Over 90 letters were sent out to veterans because of the event.
 We have a lot of students who identify with having a family member who is a veteran,” Chun said.
Veterans Affairs Liaison at LIU and a veteran herself, Michele O’Brien, says that the letters are sent to veterans living in nursing homes as well as to the Fisher House Foundation, which is a charity and that builds comfort homes where military & veterans families can stay free of charge, while a loved one is in the hospital.
As for the Flag Raising Ceremony, O’Brien says that while Promise was not able to have the same event as years past due to COVID-19 restrictions, the ceremony was nonetheless a success this year.
 “Our speaker, Maria Duame, was amazing,” O’Brien said. Daume is a freshman social work major who served in the United States Marine Corps from 2016 to 2020.
“We did have a special guest this year which was extremely nice; Gregory Ramaeka who was a Petty Officer in the United States Coast Guard. It is always nice to have veterans supporting veterans,” O’Brien said.
Stay updated with LIU Veteran Affairs and any upcoming events they have on liu-post.presence.io.

November is American Diabetes Awareness Month; a month in which over 34 million Americans try to spread awareness for their commonly misunderstood medical condition. 
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), diabetes is defined as a “chronic health condition” where the body cannot produce and/or use insulin, which causes individuals to have low/unstable blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes; type one and type two.
Type one diabetes is less common, as 5-10 percent diabetics have this type. Individuals can get type one at any age, although it is more commonly diagnosed during childhood adolescence. Those who have type one cannot produce insulin, and must take insulin shots and check their blood sugar regularly in order to maintain their health. Currently, there is no known way to prevent or cure type one diabetes.
Type two is the most common form of diabetes, as 90-95 percent of diabetics have this type. Unlike those with type one, type two diabetics can produce insulin, but their bodies do not respond normally and struggle to use it properly. Because of this, individuals’ blood sugar rises to dangerous levels, which causes serious health risks if untreated. Treatment for type two diabetics differs between every individual, with some requiring certain medications, insulin shots and/or frequent blood sugar monitoring. Similar to type one, there is no known cure, but individuals can lower their risk of having type two diabetes through living a healthy lifestyle through diet and exercise.
Junior musical theatre major Hannah Winston has been living with diabetes since she was 12 years old. She describes her typical day managing diabetes as a never-ending cycle of health monitoring, medical device usage and adjusting to her blood glucose levels.
“There’s definitely not a set equation in terms of management, but a typical day looks like waking up checking my blood sugar, eating before class, then giving myself an insulin injection before or after meals, carb counting everything I eat in order to give myself the right dosage, checking my sugar again, and listening to my body and trying to regulate it the best I can even if I am not 100% that day.”
Winston recalls the struggles of when she was first diagnosed with diabetes.
“I was 12 years old, going to the doctor for a well check before the start of 5th grade. I remember that it was such a complicated time, right before I entered middle school and I was so nervous to go back to school to familiar faces with this new aspect of my life needing my constant attention,” she said. “Not to mention navigating it at school, events, friends, and family, I felt that because everything wasn’t “normal” for me at the time that I had to make it seem like everything wasn’t different with me.”
Despite these early struggles, she learned how to manage her health during her everyday life. 
“Now, having gone through middle school, high school, and now a junior in college I’ve been branching out and learning that I can advocate for myself whether it be to professors about certain accommodations like eating Starbursts or snacks in class to treat a low blood sugar, or if my phone or sensor makes a noise to alert me about my blood sugar trends,” she said. “It definitely has been a lot of growing and reflection to know that my medical condition isn’t a burden to others and shouldn’t ever be, because if I don’t prioritize my health I can’t be myself at the end of the day. I can’t be 100 percent Hannah.”
Winston believes that although she is capable of doing everything a non-diabetic can do, she feels her perspective on life differs as a result of her condition.  
“I can still do everything your average person with a working pancreas can do, but for me everything is looked at through a different lense. I have to think about how food affects my body, but also how my medication will affect my body in the present moment as well as throughout the day,” she said. “I also have to be my own best advocate 24/7, on the clock, always in regards to not letting my medical condition dictate my quality of life. So, even though my experiences are different from most, I always try to adapt because that’s all that I can do for myself with this.”
As a type one diabetic, Winston stresses the importance of educating the public on the disease. 
“Non-diabetics still fall into the trap of the misconceptions surrounding this medical condition. I’ve heard comments around campus before that feed into or are the result from the stigma around diabetes in general. So I implore people to do research and to not just make assumptions about this condition just because they know Nick Jonas has it or that they think that they’ll get this condition because they had a second donut that day,” she said. “Awareness is essential and I think that most don’t realize the severity of living with this type of disease. So please, talk to us, we’re open books and love to educate others because it could save a life one day. All in all, everyone needs this hormone, insulin, to live. The only difference is that diabetics get their insulin in a different way.”
