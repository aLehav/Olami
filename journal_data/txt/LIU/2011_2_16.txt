It is definitely not easy being green, as Kermit the Frog and our new alumni columnist, the lovely Kayla Krause, reported in this week’s issue of the Pioneer.  Even though these two individuals have next to nothing in common (last time I checked Kayla was not a puppet), they do have one thing that towers above the rest.  Besides the coincidence that both their names start with the letter K, they both have insight; they have a different perception on what it’s like to be on the “outside.”  After only one semester out of our little college community, Kayla has totally revamped her world.  She has forced herself to start fresh, and make a career for herself.  I can only hope I can achieve what she has done with as much poise and persistence. A job well done partner, you landed your first job and I wanted to use this vessel we started together to personally congratulate you! And of course, Kermit has insight on what its like to be a puppet.  I don’t think any of us know what that’s like.  (Boy, it’s hard to write a letter every week about something…or nothing. Can’t you tell?)
 
The Pioneer has also tapped into their green side.  One staff writer reports on recycling on campus.  Are we as environmental-friendly as they say?  What does the student body think? The only thing I’ve personally noticed is the “green” toilets in Humanities: “flush up for liquid, flush down for…ya know.”  Not that I’m that big on being green anyway.  What’s aerosol really going to do? As for the rest of the news section, we got the scoop on the microwaves in Brookville hall. Even though they are fixed now, what was the hold up? We also have a few lectures covered from this weekend.
 
Are you feeling SAD this semester? Our features editor covers why some of you might be feeling those winter blues and what you can do to change your mood.  We also have our relationship columnist on your “body count” – read on to find out what the student body has to say about that.  And as always our Pioneer sports team has covered what’s going on in athletics.
 
As usual, we love you for picking up the Pioneer.  The more readers the better!  Feel free to write to us or write FOR us.  Just contact us, anytime, at cwpstpnr@gmail.com!

In just under a month, the C.W. Post softball team will begin their long-awaited 2011 season in Kissimmee, Florida. While their first game is still weeks away, the team has been preparing since January for what they hope will be a very successful season.
Last year, Coach Jamie Apicella said, “we had a tremendous regular season.”  However, the team was left disappointed with the way in which their 2010 season went after posting a 1-4 record in the East Coast Conference Championships and NCAA Division II East Regional.  “We were plagued by injuries last year,” Apicella pointed out, a factor that contributed to the poor end to last season.  Staying healthy, he said, is the team’s top priority this preseason.
Coming out on top is another priority for the Pioneers’ softball team in 2011.  The team’s conference, the ECC, is a very competitive conference, claiming two nationally ranked teams in their member schools, in 12th-ranked Molloy College and 24th-ranked Dowling.  Though the Pioneers themselves were not ranked in the NFCA Preseason Top 25 Poll, they did receive votes, and they are currently slotted as third in ECC polls.
“The ECC is a very strong and challenging league,” Apicella said.  However, the team remains hopeful that they may walk away with a conference or regional title in 2011.  In the meantime, the team is looking forward to their upcoming schedule.  “We would definitely like to get another chance at Molloy,” Apicella said.  Soon enough, they will.
The Pioneers begin their season on March 13th with a weeklong away trip to the Rebel Spring Games in Kissimmee, Florida.  Their first opponent will be Stonehill College, a team that finished 2010 with less than half the wins C.W. Post earned in 2010.

For many athletes, finding the time to eat during the day is a huge challenge. Coaches run long practices in all sports, and after practices are over, large amounts of homework often prevent student athletes from having a meal for dinner. Many students would have to run to Winnick, grab a to go tray, and rush back to their rooms to get their work done. Some would go to Hillwood and grab a quick Subway sandwich but won’t have much time to enjoy it. Many times, athletes have class right after practice and must grab a quick energy bar from the Shop of Commons in Hillwood and make that their dinner. It’s a struggle, but athletes have dealt with it.
Recently however, it has come to the attention of members of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee that students have voiced their concerns about not being able to eat a meal for lunch. SAAC is a student organization that helps to make the college experience better for student athletes, while also participating in community service, organizing events, and promoting games that take place at the Pratt.
As many of you may know, the Pratt Center has a concession stand that is always open for football and basketball games during their respective seasons, but not on a regular basis. SAAC member Sarah Kiser, who is also a senior pitcher on the C.W. Post softball team, explained that opening the concession stand regularly was a priority for the organization coming into the spring semester. “As you know, athletes are constantly in the Pratt, and we’re pretty much always running from practice to class and back. A lot of student athletes began complaining about the lack of time to eat, especially with coaches making use of common hour practices,” she said. Kiser explained that since the concession stand was already used during the course of the year, it would not be hard to open it on a regular basis. “Since there was already a concession stand with food storage equipment in it from football and basketball games, we thought it would be very easy to get it open on regular days as well.”
With the idea now out there, the members of SAAC needed to talk to someone to make this happen. “ We basically just had to talk to Aramark and faculty members of the Pratt to see if it was possible. Once we got the go ahead, Aramark pretty much handled everything else which made life easier,” said Kiser. Also, she noted, “Coach Meg (the girls lacrosse coach) really helped us with everything this year, and she’s a big reason the café is open now,”
Now that the concession stand could be open regularly, the question was what to offer for students to eat. “SAAC members are partly responsible for what is being served there now,” Kiser explained. “We took the aspects we like from each café around campus, and wanted to put it all into one. If it’s successful this year, we are hoping to get a juice/smoothie bar type thing there next year.” At the Pratt Center café, students can get salads, sandwiches, and other healthy choices. According to Kiser, the stand seems to be doing very well, she and the rest of SAAC, hope that this success continues.

The C.W. Post men’s basketball team has played excellent basketball their past few games, putting together three consecutive wins after their loss early in the month to Bridgeport. Since that loss, the Pioneers have rebounded to win back-to-back road games against the Mercy Mavericks and the Dowling Golden Lions. The Pioneers sustained their solid play when they came back home to beat the NYIT Bears on Saturday 81-73.
The Pioneers (17-7) faced Dowling (6-16) last Wednesday night, in a match-up that would decide who would win the season series. Dowling had won the first battle early on in the season 86-73. A month later, the Pioneers evened up the series as they won 80-70. At this point, both teams had won on their home floor, but Post was about to end that.
Dowling had their home crowd in front on them, but the Pioneers came out more ready to play than the Golden Lions did. The Pioneers set a quick pace to the game, never letting the Golden Lions get into the game, building an 11 point lead by halftime.
The Pioneers played a well-rounded game as no one player dominated the ball. It was a group effort, led by sophomore guard Jonathan Kohler’s 18 points. Stefan Bonneau also continued his outstanding play, only missing one shot for the night (7-8) and matching Kohler with 18 points. Senior guard Gil Montalvo set the tone for the offense and spread the ball around the floor with his nine assists. Senior forward Aaron Hall also had another brilliant game, bringing down a game-high 14 rebounds.
In C.W. Post’s last game against NYIT, the Pioneers kept the winning going with an 81-73 nail-biter over the Bears. The Pioneers made nearly half of their shots from the field, and displayed another balanced scoring attack with four players notching double figures in scoring.
Hall was the leading scorer for Post with 16 points, followed by Bonneau with 14. Kohler continued his strong play as he dropped 12 points, and has now averaged 17 points over his last four games. In addition, junior guard Billy Butler recorded his second double-double of the campaign scoring 10 points and dishing out 11 assists.
The Pioneers have played fantastic basketball since the new year, winning 13 of their last 14 games. Their next game comes against the Molloy Lions (8-14) on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. at Molloy College. These two teams have split the first two games against each other this season. The Pioneers are currently in first place in the ECC standings, and will try to remain atop the standings as they play their final two road games of the season this week.

The C.W. Post women’s basketball team’s season continued in an up and down fashion this past week. They lost on Wednesday, February 9th to Dowling College 67-60, but ended the week on a positive note beating NYIT 75-65.
On Wednesday, the Pioneers found themselves trailing by nine points to start the game. Dowling never let the Pioneers lead or get back into the game, and cruised to a 67-60 victory.  Janea Aiken lead C.W. Post in scoring, racking up 15 points and 8 rebounds, but the combination of Connie Simmons and Seja Gamble (42 points combined) was just too much for the Pioneers.
On Saturday, February 12th, it was part three of the Battle for the Boulevard as the Pioneers hosted NYIT. It would be the rubber game between the two since the Pioneers won the first contest of the season, but NYIT took the second.
The first half was back and forth. The Pioneers built up an 11-4 lead but then saw it quickly evaporate when the NYIT Bears went on a 7-0 run to tie the game at 11. The Pioneers offense fell silent, not scoring for close to seven minutes, during which the Bears built up a six point lead. The Pioneers managed to cut their deficit to five by the end of the half, but still found themselves trailing 29-24.
In the second half it was all Pioneers, outscoring the Bears 51-36 to wrap up a 75-65 victory. Three Pioneers had double digit points in the win, Janea Aiken lead the team with 26 while Felcia Joyner and Ashley Caggiano had 16 and 12 respectively.
In an odd trend the Pioneers have won their last four Saturday games while losing their last four Wednesday games. C.W. Post looks to change that this week when they travel to Molly College on Wednesday, February 16th and then Saint Thomas Aquinas College on Saturday the 19th. Coverage of both games can be heard on 88.1 FM and WCWPSports.org.

On Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of C.W. Post student-athletes jumped into the ice-cold ocean to help support the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Metro New York.  Organized by the Student Athlete Advisory Committee, the event was a huge success as the athletes joined thousands of other brave souls at Long Beach for the 12th Annual Superbowl Splash.
The event began in 1999 as four men simply having some fun before the Super Bowl. It has since grown to become a huge event on the south shore of Long Island, drawing huge crowds of people to observe and participate in the fun.  The event takes place every year with the sponsorship of the Long Beach Polar Bear Club, who participates every year in honor of Paulie Bradley. He passed in 1997 at the age of four, too quickly for his wish to be granted. In 2010, the Superbowl Splash exceeded the $2 million mark, doubling the amount of money raised in the first eight years of fundraising.
Unusually mild weather and the D.J. stage pumping music that could be heard blocks away almost gave the feeling of being at a beach party for many of the participants, as they ran into the Atlantic. Some wore standard beach attire, while others chose more courageous, more revealing costumes.  The Superbowl Splash takes place every year in Long Beach on Super Bowl Sunday.  Anyone is welcome to participate, make a donation, or buy some “Polar Wear” available year-round on the Polar Bear Club’s website at www.longbeachpolarbears.org.

NBA:  Rumors have been swirling all season long regarding the future of Denver Nuggets superstar Carmelo Anthony. The New Jersey Nets were intrigued with Carmelo. Owner Mikhail Prokhorov took his team out of the running because the Nuggets front office wanted too much in return. In a new twist to the ‘Melodrama,’ the Los Angeles Lakers, who have been struggling by their standards, were thought of as a possible destination for ‘Melo.
But here we are again. ‘Melo to the Knicks? We’ve heard it all year long. The rumors do not go away. Everyday there is a new developing plot with Carmelo Anthony as the main character. One day the Knicks are believed to be trading Anthony Randolph, Wilson Chandler, and Eddy Curry’s expiring contract. The next day, we hear that Denver wants Danilo Gallinari or Landry Fields, or both! Then we learn that a swap of Raymond Felton for Chauncey Billups may make Denver complete this never-ending deal. Then, just to cause even more chaos, ‘Melo says that he’ll take a long hard look at the contract the Nuggets gave him in the off-season. as he might stay in Denver after all!
What we do know is that the Knicks need another superstar alongside Amare Stoudemire. The Knicks are just an average team; their record currently stands one game above the .500 mark, at 26-25. That is mediocre any way you look at it, especially in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks currently have the sixth seed in the East, and it looks like they will be able to make the playoffs, but the question is: How far can they go?
The Knicks have a decent team. They have a fun, up-tempo, nice-to-watch offense that will occasionally play defense here or there to come up with wins. Amare is the main threat, with a solid supporting cast of Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, and Landry Fields. But I have a hard time believing that this team can win a Championship. Another superstar is needed alongside Amare to propel the New York Knicks back into greatness.
The Knicks have lost 11 of their last 16 games. A change is needed. Hopefully, that change comes soon.
 
 
MLB:  Spring Training is right around the corner for both the Yankees and Mets. The Yankees are coming off a respectable 95-67 season, but it can definitely be considered a disappointing season for the Bronx Bombers. The Yankees will look to get Championship number 28 this season, but they will have to overcome some obstacles to achieve that goal. First off, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez showed noticeable aging throughout the 2010 season. Can both of them stay healthy and play like they did in their younger days? With Andy Pettitte retiring, can Phil Hughes and A.J Burnett be counted on to hold up the rotation? Hughes had a great start to last season, but he struggled to give the Yanks innings late in the year. Who fills out the backend of the rotation? Ivan Nova pitched well at times last year, and Freddy Garcia was signed to a minor league contract. Can the Yankees survive with a weak back-end of the rotation?
The Mets have just as many questions as the Yankees do. The Mets finished with an under .500 record last season as they went 79-83. There were no major free agent acquisitions to speak of for the Mets, and Johan Santana had shoulder surgery in the off-season. At what point will he come back, and will he have the same consistency as he did before the injury? Is K-Rod back? He had an up-and-down year, on and off the field. Is his head on straight? He’s an important piece to the Mets, and they need him to finish out games. Can the Mets rotation hold up in the tough National League East? The Phillies signed prized free-agent Cliff Lee, making the rival Phillies an even scarier team. Mike Pelfrey and Chris Young will have to really step up for the Mets this season for them to be successful.

So, Paul has about 14 under his belt, and James has about 10. Jessica has five, but these five came in the span of roughly six months. I guess, you can take this as your cliché example, but off what, you ask?  Body counts. From what you just read, who do you think really gets labeled negatively first? In this phallic ruled society, a lot of judgment is placed on how many sexual partners a woman has and the amount of time in which she acquired them. From a woman’s perspective, it can be frustrating that men aren’t held to the same standards as women are. I always think that there’s a great dialogue that comes from this topic. The differences in opinion are vast, and these conversations are fueled by passions, which have been fueled by years of upbringing and morals, or lack thereof.
This topic really pushes the envelope; it’s an ongoing debate in which ultimately, I think women are looking for what they see as a “fair shake,” for the most part. Many of our ideals seem to disadvantage women in our society. To be a little more technical, the plain discourses we use to describe promiscuity within our genders are vastly different. When you look at it, there are way more negative words to describe  promiscuous women than there are to describe their male counterparts. I’ve asked many people to use a derogatory term to describe a man, and I hear words such as “dog,” “man-whore,” “ jerk,” and “dirt bag.” These words don’t really have the sting of the many words there are to describe women, such as “smut,” “pop,”  “hoe,” “slut”. We can surely go on, but I think you all have the idea.
Many people claim that they aren’t judgmental, but when you begin to speak about stereotyping and a perception, that is exactly what you are doing: judging. I always feel that it pays to stay true to yourself. What is meant by that is, to be honest, we all do judge. We should all make conscious efforts to not be judgmental, and that is all you can really ask. I asked some students from Post about how they felt about body counts and how it effected their perceptions. Here’s what was said:
“For women, it’s quality over quantity, and for men, it’s quantity over quality” says junior Carlos Clemente. He went on to say that “this is the thought process of most men and women ideally.” Junior Katrina Clayton weighed in on the issue as well, saying, “If a guy has a high number of “bodies” he’s labeled as a BOSS, but if a female has that same high number, she’s labeled as a hoe – which guys who have a ridiculously high number should be labeled as well.” She goes onto say that “some girls are hoes, indeed, but it’s just the fact that guys get praise for doing the same things that ‘hoes’ do.” Matthew Waters, on one hand, says that “no one deserves to be labeled, but the double standard definitely exists, especially with the male ,’badge of honor philosophy.’ “I feel like it’s bull and a meaningless double standard,” responded a female, who would rather be left anonymous.
It’s safe to say that many of us live under the precedent set by an earlier generation. There are some ideals people wish to contest, and they are successful at doing so, but when you deal with issues of judgment, it’s a whole different ball game. The world has thought in this one dimension for so long, functioning on these double standard philosophies, and we’re all guilty of it to some degree. Circumstances shape these opinions, and you can’t really judge until you know the whole story.

“It’s not easy being green.”  I’m sure you all know this phrase from your friendly children’s muppet, Kermit the Frog.  But for the first time in my life I understand what Kermit’s saying…well let’s just say I can relate.
 
Being a recent college graduate of Post, I suddenly realized that your dreams don’t all come true within a day.  We all have our hopes and dreams of when we finish college that we’ll land that first “real job” or get into that number one ranked graduate school.  But it’s not that easy.
 
I thought I had it all planned out.  I had two successful internships with two huge companies. I had stayed in touch with both of them and every other person, corporation or contact I had within the journalism industry.  I began looking in September, four months before I would actually be eligible for a full-time job.  Things seemed promising, I received emails that said “you’re definitely on our radar, once something opens up we’ll give you a call,” and “okay we’ve put you at the top of our pile so when a news assistant job opens up we’ll contact you.”
 
But when that long awaited day came and I was finished with my undergraduate career, the Christmas and New Year’s festivities had come to an end, I was there back at my home in Massachusetts…without a job.
 
Now I guess I shouldn’t have been so naïve to think that I would magically have a job once I finished school and I was done partying with my friends at home during the holidays…but I guess I was that naïve because I was extremely distraught over the situation.
 
That’s when I got myself back into “school mode,” so to speak.  I made a spreadsheet of what companies had openings, when I applied to them, my correspondence with them, etc. Finally I landed a freelance position for the local newspaper. I wrote my first features piece and was published! Finally I was published and actually paid for it!  But then I got discouraged again. Sure, this was all fine and wonderful, but this was only a freelance job.  I needed a full-time position.
 
This is where my advice comes in to all of you seniors…don’t give up.  You have to be persistent and annoying as hell to wherever you apply.  You have to work hard every day to apply to places over and over and over again. You’re going to write a bazillion cover letters and be interviewed by a bazillion more companies.  But most importantly, maintain your contacts.  Whoever you meet, stay in touch with them; whoever your parents know, stay in touch with them, because you never know when a position might open up…because you may be the one to fill it.
 
I only say this because that’s how I finally got my first “real job.”  After nearly two months of applying for jobs, I had written over 50 cover letters and emails and made a million and one phone calls, I had just about given up for good.  But then I got a phone call from my dad.  I answered, assuming it was just like any other phone conversation with him…but to my delight, he says that his friend (who is the CEO and president of a large corporation) is looking to expand his company and would like to hire someone who can write.
 
And voila! A week later, there I was, driving to an interview in Needham, MA and about to meet with the VP of marketing of this company.  It was a lot easier than I projected it to be.  I had come prepared -that’s another thing, always be prepared!  Do your research. Know what the company does, how they do it and what they plan to do in the future.
 
You get major points if you sound knowledgeable about the person or company going into the interview – this shows that you, one, care about getting this job; two, are well prepared for the interview; and three, took the time to do the research and weren’t too preoccupied by Facebook, twitter or your blog.
 
Now those are a few tips I can hand out to you kids out there looking to apply for a job in the near future.  Graduating may seem easy in the moment: you’re done with classes, no more term papers or final exams (or at least until grad school that is), you have all the free time in the world and most importantly you’ve got a degree under your belt.  But then you start applying for jobs, you hear back from some and not from others…but don’t give up.
 
Again, it’s like Kermit said ‘it’s not easy being green,’ well Kermie, it’s not easy being a college undergraduate either.  Just don’t give up, that’s all I can say, don’t give up.

Long Island native Mary D’Ambrosio visited C.W. Post last Thursday, February 10th. Students from the Media Arts Department filled the Humanities classroom to above expectations. Professor Sandra Mardenfeld gave extra-credit to students in her class who attended, but even without the extra-credit, students still sat with wonder at what D’Ambrosio had to say.
D’Ambrosio explained that she received a degree in Journalism from Syracuse University. Her first trip was to Latin America because that is where the news was at that time. She stayed in Latin America for four years covering stories for the Associated Press and other news publications. While in Latin America she spent time in Cuba, Brazil, and Venezuela. In Venezuela she worked for an English Language paper and even got to meet the infamous Fidel Castro.

D’Ambrosio urged students who are interested in Journalism to travel to different countries and report stories that are going on in the area. D’Ambrosio serves on the editorial board of Abroad View, which encourages students to study abroad. Every year, she hosts a trip to Istanbul, Turkey and/or Italy. For a month, students are able to stay in the Turkish College, Bahcesehir University. The students stay in the dorms and take classes five days a week from 9-12 in the afternoon. After classes, students are able to go into the village and report local stories. Students earn 3 credits for the trip from their attending college.
D’Ambrosio showed the students videos of what to expect when in Turkey and Italy. Many students were eager to learn more, D’Ambrosio was available for questioning after.
At the end of the discussion, students were urged by D’Ambrosio to do internships, travel, and write more while you are young. Corporations will be impressed to see that a student has traveled and written his or her own stories, which could be sold to American newspapers. “Journalism is a competitive field, but if you start from the bottom and work your way up, you can achieve anything,” said D’Ambrosio.

It’s Common Hour. Love it or hate it, it’s the prime time for most Post students to relieve their hunger pains. If you’re going to Winnick, you might find that there are lines wrapped around the place in order to get food. The Hillwood Café is one place on campus that may have that down to a science. To tackle the long lines and frustration Common Hour brings, Hillwood came up with a system that does just that: the Grab ‘N Go system.
When asked how this system is treating them, many students of CW Post had one answer, which was one question: “What’s a Grab ‘N Go?” I, myself, was unaware of what this system was, but when explained to me, I knew exactly what it was. For those of you who are reading this who are still confused, let me bring that Oh yeah! I-know-what-that-is! moment to you. The “Grab ‘N Go” is the system located at the grill area of the Hillwood Café. The food is already made, stored in containers, labeled, and is ready to be eaten. This system was put in place so that anyone can simply “Grab ‘N Go”.
For the most part, this system has had a positive effect so far. “It’s improved [service] since last semester. There were a lot of long lines and lack of food. This semester it’s so much easier”, says Kevin Schmidt, a senior Digital Arts major. “You get the food you want, pay for it, and go”.  When asked about how the service has been since this system was developed, Hillwood Café worker Christine said “It’s popular and convenient”.
Although the Grab ‘N Go has its advantages over the long lines, some students think differently. “Because of the Common Hour, you can’t really ‘Grab ‘N Go’”, says senior Jill Salterella of a crowded Hillwood during Post’s most controversial hour. Other students commented on variety. “What I want is not there and I have to wait”, says Psychology major Kim Laudin, a transfer student. Should there be more options other than burgers, fries, and chicken for the Grab ‘N Go?

As the panic from the recent virus outbreak winds down, students are beginning to wonder the real cause of this illness.  In our last issue, students voiced their concerns over the food in Winnick Hall.
In recent weeks, all students have been e-mailed a request to fill out a health survey. The survey asked students to detail their activities, food intake, interactions etc. According to Nancy Marksbury, the Deputy Chief Information Officer at C.W. Post, the questions were compiled by the Nassau County Department of Health. “The questions were developed at the request of the Nassau County Department of Health to gather the best data possible to determine the possible cause of the stomach virus,” Marksbury said. “All information collected by these surveys is maintained with the utmost care for student privacy in accordance with University adherence to FERPA guidelines and our commitment to protecting student information.”
William Milford, Director of Student Health, reported only 16 cases in most recent weeks. “The reported cases seem to be winding down. As yet, to my knowledge, the Nassau County Health Department has not reported final conclusions from the testing they have done,” Milford added. “The current medical thought is that this is a stomach virus similar to what is being seen in the surrounding counties.”
While the Department of Health was not immediately available for comment, it has been made clear by C.W. Post administrators that the Department of Health is conducting a full on investigation of the illness. It was at first thought that this illness was due to the food in Winnick Hall. However, according to Shawn Carvajal, director of C.W. Post Dining Services, early medical reports show that this was not a food-borne illness. “Dining Services always works closely the Nassau County Department of Health and follows stringent guidelines for food safety,” Carvajal said. The drinking water on campus has also been tested and has come back as negative for contamination.
Results from the Nassau County Department of Health are still pending. For more information on how to prevent illness on campus, please contact the Student Health Center at (516) 299-2345.

Have you ever wondered what it takes to defend our nation’s security?  Maybe you even thought that Homeland Security could be a career that you wanted to pursue?  Well now, the Riverhead campus of Long Island University is giving students just that opportunity.
 
A fully online program, Riverhead’s Homeland Security Management Institute offers two programs: one graduate-level, 15-credit Advanced Certificate in Homeland Security Management, and one 36-credit Master of Science degree in Homeland Security Management.  The program is the only registered and accredited Homeland Security graduate program in New York State.  The ease of hosting an online program allows the college to attract the attention of Homeland Security professionals who may be working a great distance from the campus, but are still looking to gain a higher education.
 
Andrea Borra, the Director of Admissions for the Riverhead campus, added that you don’t have to be far away to attend classes through this program. “We do have a few C.W. Post students that take some Homeland Security courses as electives, and the program is open to any Long Island University campus student,” explained Borra.
 
In an informational pamphlet about the program, Paul Stockton, a Senior Research Scholar at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation said, “The Homeland Security Management Institute programs have been recognized and commended as one of the nation’s leading graduate programs in the Homeland Security/Defense field…they’re the real deal.”
 
While the program does require a Bachelor’s Degree with a 3.0 GPA from an accredited university to be considered for admission, it will also make some exceptions for those highly motivated homeland security practitioners who may have fulfilled all the requirements for completing a Bachelor’s Degree through the work they’ve completed in their field.
 
Tom Prygocki, a student currently enrolled in the Master of Science degree in Homeland Security Management, commented that after taking a crime and terrorism class in his undergraduate career at Northeastern University, he knew that homeland security was a field he wanted to pursue as a career.  When asked about why he chose Long Island University, Prygocki explained that, “I think that this really is the best program out there.  The quality of professors, of classes and of student interaction is really unbeatable.  Each student posts weekly and you comment and start discussions with each other based off questions that the professors post.”
 
Borra added that the program, which was established in 2004, has approximately 170 students currently enrolled in it.  To students who are interested in pursuing a career in homeland security Tom advised that, “There are a lot of homeland security jobs out there and you need to stand out to get an agencies attention.  This program really helps you to do that.”  For more information about this program visit Long Island University Homeland Security Management Institute’s Web site at: www.liu.edu/homeland.

On Friday February 11, the Hillwood Lecture Hall was packed with students, faculty, and community locals to celebrate Black History Month, and Abraham Lincoln.
Valeda Dent, Dean of the University of Libraries opened the program with a warm welcome to audience members. She gave a small speech about her childhood growing up with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s children. She spoke of his wife, Coretta Scott King, and concluded with something she said: “Remembering events are not as important as making what we were fighting for a way of life.”             Dr. Jeffery Kane, Vice President for Academic Affairs, was the next to speak. He shared a personal reflection of the concept of remote history. Kane spoke of how when he was younger, the Civil War seemed so long ago. He went on to describe how he lived through the civil rights movement. “I remember water cannons, Rosa Parks, George Wallace. I can remember students being ushered into schools,” said Kane. “ What happened 50 years ago is ever present in our lives. History is a daily part of life in ourselves as a culture.” He summed up his speech saying, “History is not so remote.”             Provost Dr. Paul Forestell then introduced the Keynote speaker, David Carlyon. Carlyon, is an actor, writer, and independent scholar. He has a Ph.D. in Theater History from Northwestern University, and has been an Equity actor and playwright. He graduated from the University of Michigan, served as a military policeman, and then graduated from Berkeley Law. Carlyon was a clown with Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. He is the author of award winning “Dan Rice: The Most Famous Man You’ve Never Heard Of,” a biography and cultural history of 19th-century America. Carlyon gave a presentation entitled, “The Gettysburg Address: Politics Overlaps Performance.” The lecture highlighted similarities between the Gettysburg Address and a speech by actor Edwin Forrest. Carlyon believed Forrest’s Speech, given on July 4, 1838, might have influenced Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address in 1863. One of the more obvious similarities was Forrest’s, “Three score and two years ago,” and Lincolns, “Four score and seven years ago.” Carlyon went on to discuss more rhetorical and political similarities between the two.             Throughout the presentation, Carlyon interacted with his audience and kept the viewers’ attention. At one point, he asked for a cordless microphone just so he could walk around on the stage. Carlyon’s passion for the topic was evident as he presented with energy and enthusiasm. Carlyon concluded his lecture by answering questions from the audience.              “The lecture and performance were both very informative,” said sophomore Mike O’Toole. “They really showed how art and history act together to help us understand past events. The historian can create insightful narratives using known facts while the artist has the ability to fill in the gaps by using artistic liberties to really bring us closer to the possible truth of the past. Then we can apply them to our own progress.”             Professor Rick DesRochers, Assistant Professor of Theatre at Post, led the next part of the program. DesRochers is an Artistic Associate at the Play Penn New Play Development Conference of Philadelphia, and has served as the Literary Director for the Joseph Papp Public Theatre/New York Shakespeare Festival. DeRochers was the Artistic Director of the New Theatre of Boston for six seasons, where he produced and directed over 50 new plays and musicals.             DesRochers took the stage with Adam Newborn and Tremaine O’Gara, two students from Post’s Theatre department. The students read two scenes from two different Suzan-Lori Parks’ plays The American Play, and Pulitzer Prize winning Topdog/Underdog. “As a member of Post Theater Company it was truly an honor to be able to participate in this lecture,” said Newborn. “I also found out some great things about Abraham Lincoln during my rehearsal process with Rick DesRochers. I hope our reading sparked interest about the story behind Abraham Lincoln.” The performances captured the audience’s attention with actual quotes from John Wilkes Booth. “Thus to the tyrants,” yelled O’Garro, who played the part of Booth. “The south is avenged!”             “The performances really added to the presentation,” said senior Dan Degerman. “It was interesting to see a different portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.”             The program concluded with Professor Manju Prasad-Rao, head of the Instructional Media Center at the library. Prasad-Rao spoke of the library’s efforts to get involved with museums online in virtual worlds such as Second Life. She showed a walkthrough of second life where an Abraham Lincoln art exhibit was being shown. After Prasad-Rao finished speaking, she invited the audience for refreshments in the fishbowl.              The event was sponsored by the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, the Port Washington Public Library, the Hutton House Lectures, the Post Library Assn., HEOP, Hillwood Museum, the Honors Program, the Political Science Department, Phi Delta Kappa Chapter 1524, and the Department of Theatre, Film, Dance, and Arts Management.

For the last few months, hundreds of residents of Brookville Hall have been going without a necessity: their microwave room. Since late in the fall 2010 semester, residents of Brookville Hall have been going to nearby halls to warm up their food. A right that is supposed to be included in a student’s resident life accommodations. Accounting major, Janiece Robinson says, “It sucks that I have to walk to Riggs Hall just to warm up a Cup of Noodles soup. It’s not fair, this problem should have been fixed a long time ago.”
According to Resident Life Director Raymond Gordon, “Brookville Hall’s microwave room was victim to numerous acts of vandalism. The two microwaves of the kitchen were both damaged, ceiling tiles were completely broken down, and there was a broken window. To solve these issues with vandalism, security cameras will be installed 24/7. Repairs will be made and the microwaves will be replaced on Wednesday, February 9th, 2011”.
Brookville Resident Hall Director Kelly Carpino refused to speak to us; however, if you have any other questions about the Brookville microwave room, contact her at her office in the Brookville lobby or by phone at (516) 299-3069 or email kelly.carpino@liu.edu.
 
**Editors Note: Days after this article was written, the microwaves in Brookville were fixed as they said they would be.

Delta Week’s “Empire State of Mind” was filled with a weeklong set of activities consisting of “Color Me Culture,” “Fit NYC,”  “Select or Reject,” “Men’s Appreciation: Honoring the Kings,” and a trip to A. Holly Patterson Nursing Home. These weeklong activities started from January 31st and continued through February 4th. Nicole Ramlogan, a sophomore, said that Delta Week was “informative.” In an interview with the President of Pi Rho Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Rebecca Blair, shared how the idea came about, the events that took place, the outcome, and the positive feedback that was received.
Although Vice President of Delta Sigma Theta Karisma Owens helped in every aspect of creating ideas, programming and leading the program, Blair gave a rundown as to how Delta Week came about. You might think that their Men’s Appreciation Night tied into Valentine’s Day, but the women of the Pi Rho chapter had something else in mind.
“We thought of the program idea [Honoring the Kings] so that it can tie into Black History Month and honor men because when we think of Martin Luther King, we think of men and their leadership roles to support change and initiative,” said Blair. The series of events created throughout the week were centered around this same concept.
According to Blair, on Monday, “Color Me Culture” focused on “different cultures and basically how they related to American culture.” Tuesday’s “Fit NYC” was about “physical awareness, staying in shape, nutrition advice and healthy eating habits.” If that wasn’t enough, Wednesday’s “Select or Reject” was based on “interviewing skills and presentation skills” and also included a mock interview. Thursday’s event, entitled “Men’s Appreciation Honoring the Kings,” honored Dan Capalbo and Billy Achnitz for their roles on campus. The event also featured a dinner, catered by Aramak Food Services, and a ceremony. The turnout for these events were good. However, it was Friday’s event, which consisted of a community service trip to A Holly Patterson Nursing Home, which really ended Delta Week on a positive note.             Apparently, the number of students who were able to go outnumbered the students who had signed up to go on the trip. Blair commented that there was “not enough room for everyone who wanted to come.”  Those who were able to go were able to take part in activities with the nursing home residents, such as playing bingo, among other things. Due to this huge turnout, there is a possibility that this will become a tradition as a monthly trip. As Kellie Edwards, a freshman, stated, “it’s another opportunity for students.”
The feedback received for the event was positive. Blair said that some felt that “the programs were influential, the power points were good, the vibe in the audience opened great discussions, and people have taken into consideration what they eat,” in reference to Tuesday’s “Fit NYC” program.
The concept for each day’s event was inspired by different organizations. “The idea for each program came from our organizations five-point thrust program that includes economic development, educational development, international awareness and involvement, physical and mental health, political awareness and involvement,” Blair said.
Blair had additional comments that she wanted to include. She said that, “Delta Week was successful overall and was glad that the feedback was positive.” She also emphasized how the event affected her. She concluded by saying it “gave her and her line-sister motivation to continue with our programming.”

With a growing concern for the environment and protecting our planet, C.W. Post has started taking steps to become more green and eco-friendly.  But, maybe the university isn’t doing as much as it could be, and the question arises, can we do more?  Is it enough to solely rely on little bins scattered throughout the campus buildings to create awareness about recycling materials that can be reused and repurposed for other things?  Students around campus seem to have their own ideas.
Amanda Garcia, a junior education major, believes the university’s efforts have been working pretty well, so far.  “I think that the school is doing pretty well with it because they have all the bins and stuff randomly on campus.  I normally take all the bottles I use and put them there, or if I’m going home, I’ll recycle things there,” said Garcia.  Garcia is not the only one that thinks the university’s efforts are not going unnoticed.
Jacqueline Klingler, a sophomore studying early childhood special education, agreed that the campus’ efforts have helped her and her suitemates to recycle what they can as well.  “In my suite, we recycle water bottles, soda cans and whatever else we can.  We don’t recycle them on campus; we bring them to Pathmark to be recycled, but it’s still doing something,” explained Klingler.
Klingler also added that she’s not sure of what the university could be doing differently, if they can even do anything more. “They have people that come to the dorms every week to collect the recycling. Aside from that, I’m not really sure what else they could be doing,” said Klingler.
There are those that feel that the university’s current plan is just not enough, and Michael Marciano, a junior criminal justice major, added, “I don’t believe most students pay attention to it. It’s not that they don’t care, but [they] don’t realize that they could be saving recyclable items. I do it myself sometimes. The university needs to come up with an idea to get the students more involved in recycling and a way to self- promote the cause.”
Garcia, who voiced an opinion similar to Marciano’s, said, “I would say they need to have places to recycle paper in the computer labs and other places where students are constantly throwing paper away.  As students, we all use a lot of paper, so I think that would be useful.”
Although numerous attempts were made to contact Campus Services, no one has responded.  Aside from the university’s efforts, everyone should be doing his or her share to help recycle, both on and off campus.

While all of us update our Facebook statuses, follow celebrities on Twitter, and pray that an employer has stumbled upon our LinkedIn accounts, we have to wonder: How important is online communication, really?
Kristi Serrano, an alumni and adjunct professor at C.W. Post, has been working with the Internet and marketing industry for over seven years in multiple facets and is busy monitoring the largest wedding websites. Serrano graduated in 2004 with a degree in public relations and ventured through the job market in several different media marketing businesses. She was responsible for posting and running online advertising campaigns across a network of sites. Serrano specializes in Search Engine Optimization [SEO] and Social Media Marketing, but she has extensive experience in Email Marketing, Online Advertising, Analytics, and is currently the Senior Online Marketing Manager for The Knot, Inc.
Serrano has taught Online Communications, focusing on Internet Marketing, in the media arts department since 2008. Serrano said, “In 2007, Professor Abby Dress approached me with a unique opportunity to teach a course at C.W. Post, focusing on online marketing and communications. At the time, this topic had not been a mainstream topic at universities in the country. After having put together the course outline and having it approved by the department, this was one of two undergraduate courses in the country that focused entirely on online marketing and communications. “Perry Drake, at NYU, was the other professor to teach a similar course. Today, more and more universities have seen the value in this type of course and have expanded upon this; some colleges and universities have even adapted this as a major or minor program,” added Serrano.
At The Knot, Serrano is responsible for the optimization of four major brands: theknot.com, thenest.com, thebump.com and weddingchannel.com. The main focus of her role is to identify keywords and make sure that TheKnot ranks number one in Google and Bing searches. When asked how important it is for students today to understand the online business of market, Serrano’s response was, “Today, there is virtually no role in the business world that does not require some type of online experience. Without having a basic, fundamental knowledge of how the internet works and how businesses are using it to grow, students are limiting themselves. This is no longer optional.” Serrano also explained that the need for online positions has grown exponentially, and this will continue to grow.  In 2010, there were an estimated 255 million websites, and 21.4 million were added in 2010 alone. In addition, the total Internet use increased 14% to 1.97 billion Internet users around the world.
It turns out that our generation may not be as doomed as we think it is. Facebook and Twitter can help up us understand the value of social media in the world. “Understanding social media will definitely help, but it is much more than understanding how to use the technology. In order to successfully utilize this knowledge, it is important to understand how businesses are using social media to grow. In time, having grown up with this advanced knowledge of technology will provide this generation with an advantage against those with a more limited understanding of social media and technical platforms,” Serrano explained.
When asked what advice Serrano could give students at C.W. Post today, she explained that although you may not get your dream job the week after graduation, you must remember to use every opportunity as a learning experience. “You must make sure that no matter what field or direction you choose, you are learning something new every day.” Finally, Serrano was asked the awaited question: Faceook, Twitter, or Linked In? She said, “I would choose Facebook. In essence, you can use this platform the same way you can use the others, whereas Twitter and LinkedIn can be more limiting.”

Have you ever notice that people seem to be more grouchy and irritable during the fall and winter, as opposed to the summer time? Maybe the idea of walking in the brittle cold and feeling like your fingers are frostbite makes you shiver…literally. The hot sun shining on your face and the sight of the sparkling, ocean water makes you feel as if you’ve slipped right into paradise. Well, there’s a reason why people are angry; it’s not just your imagination. Many people are in fact SAD, also known as Seasonal Affective Disorder.
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) refers to multiple episodes of depression, which occur during the fall and the winter; symptoms usually improve during the spring and summer months. This disorder can begin in early adulthood, and the disorder is found more commonly in women than in men. Factors that can cause SAD are ambient light, hormone regulation, and body temperature.
So, how do you know if you have Seasonal Affective Disorder? Some symptoms that gradually begin to build up in late autumn and winter months are decreased energy and concentration, increased appetite, as a result of weight gain, excessive daytime sleepiness, lack of energy, a loss of interest in activities in work and in school, social withdrawal, and being unhappy. It’s never too late to seek professional help, and have a health care provider diagnosis your symptoms.
You may be wondering what you can do to stop being SAD. According to many doctors and other professionals, antidepressant medications and talk therapy are effective ways to treat this depression. Additionally, long walks during daylight hours and exercise can ease your symptoms. Lastly, light therapy has proven to work effectively. A special lamp, specifically a very bright fluorescent light, works as a remedy for mimicking light from the sun. All
you need to do is sit a few feet away from the light, preferably in the morning, so it looks like sunrise. Do this for 30 minutes a day. Within 3-4 weeks, symptoms should improve. However, being in front of a bright light can cause eyestrain, as well as headaches, especially in those who take medications and antibiotics because they may become increasingly sensitive to light. It is very important to consult a doctor before trying this.
Don’t worry; you don’t have to be SAD all the time. Seeking out help and continuing treatment means you don’t need to have this disorder throughout your lives. So, if you thought you were having a bad day because you missed out on your favorite cup of French vanilla coffee, or your alarm never went off and you missed class, you may be mistaken. You could just be experiencing seasonal affective disorder and not be aware of it.
