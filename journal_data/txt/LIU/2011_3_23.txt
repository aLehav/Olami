Artist Statement:  “Until four years ago, I lived in a small town in upstate New York, called LaFargeville.  Moving to Long Island opened my eyes to so many things that I never imagined.  September of my freshman year was the first time that I had the opportunity to see Manhattan.  I remember being in awe of the beautiful sights.  After visiting several more times, I began to focus less on the sights and more on the people themselves.  It intrigues me how people in New York pass by one another without saying a word.  They remain disconnected and anonymous.  It seems as if everyone is wrapped inside their own personal microcosm and wants to be left to themselves.  These photographs are a testament to see if I could connect with the average New Yorker.” – Kortney Gloska on her spring 2011 thesis exhibition, “Eyes Wide Shut.”
When I asked Gloska if she ever saw herself living in New York City, she strongly responded with, “Never! It’s too crazy for me.  Being from a small town, I am just out of my comfort zone.”  Even when it came to possible employment opportunities in the city, she swore she would always commute from Long Island.  As a sophomore now, I am always curious to know if people have plans post-graduation.
“I’ve always known I wanted to do it, ever since high school.  It’s something I can see doing [for] my whole life and not burning out, mainly because fashion always changes, and I just love it,” Gloska said.
The artist not only learned what she wanted post-graduation but “Eyes Wide Shut” also taught her a little bit about the “cold” streets of the city. Gloska stated how disappointed she was to realize how mean and unwilling people were to help out a girl trying to finish her senior project.  “You are in a city of eight million people, and you definitely can feel like you’re the only one walking around,” Gloska said.  “When the weather is cold and so are the people, it makes Manhattan a difficult place to thrive.”

On Tuesday, March 8, 2011, the Art Department presented the second lecture in “The Artist’s Role in Society Lecture Series,” featuring April Gornik on American Landscape and the Challenge of Eco-Spirituality. April Gornik is a prominent contemporary landscape painter, who discussed her role in representing the natural world in our era of technologically mediated experience. Gornik also discussed how it felt having her work included in many leading museums and the topics raised during the “Questions and Discussions.”
Gornik informed the Pioneer about her role in representing the natural world in our era of technologically mediated experiences stating, “I think that there is a cultural problem developing in terms of our being inundated with easy imagery, based mostly on the availability and glut of photographic images in our culture, that is causing an insensitivity to material and scale, the two things that make art, and in my case painting, powerful and important.”
In addition to commenting on the position she has on expressing the natural world, Gornik added that she, “used Photoshop on my computer to sketch and compose images to paint, and that there is an essential irony in using such a technologically advanced instrument as a computer to the use of a 16th century technology (painting) to render.” She continued by stating, “Art contains and conveys both a physical and emotional experience that can’t be simply duplicated by something seen on a screen or a snapshot.” Additionally she showed some admired photographs while she was relaying her point of view.
Gornik’s work is included in many leading museums including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and The Museum of Modern Art, among numerous others. Gornik said that she was “delighted, as any artist would be.” Although the topics mentioned during the “Questions and Discussions” were mainly technical questions about the materials the featured artist worked with, the attendance at the event was astonishing.
Phyllis K. Sullivan, a professor of Art commented saying that the event was well attended. Students from Post also provided their opinions about the event. Senior Dan Forsyth said, “I think using technology we have today is an advantage or will help us capture natural art that should be the focus, it is good that technology can now help us depict the natural world the negative part is that people use the technology to destroy the natural world.” Another student agreed with Forsyth. Hailong Wang, business administration major, said that the natural world depicted in photos “fit the truth [in that] it makes the art of taking pictures more artistic” because the image was not manipulated in any way.

We all know that the beauty of nature is all around us, right?  How often though is what we see on the Post campus or Long Island really recognized as being something to marvel at.  In other words, when do we stop wanting to see all the beautiful wonders of the world and start appreciating what’s in our own backyard.
Having been to a few gardens outside of the United States, I have to say that I was happily surprised to find out that the gardens at Old Westbury are being honored by the Four Seasons as one of their three most beautiful public gardens in the world.  That trumps Versailles, the Queen’s Garden in London and how many countless others.
The gardens are going to be featured in the Four Seasons Hotel in-room magazine and will provide an avenue for this beautiful botanical display to get some real national and international attention.  Honestly, I’m not sure about anyone else, but I couldn’t be any happier.  In case you’ve never visited the grounds, let me just provide a little background…
While I know that the formerly private estate is not in Brookville, it isn’t too far away, located on Old Westbury Road, it’s right off the Long Island Expressway.  (Hint, hint, for anyone living on campus or that commutes this is a good way to spend a day…)  The house and gardens themselves sit on 200 acres of property comprised of ponds, lakes, woodlands, formal gardens and landscaped grounds.  There are guided tours along with various other different events that the gardens host: from gardening classes to pop concert series and classic car shows, or you can just simply go for a stroll.
There are so many different varieties of plants and flowers there (the archway covered in roses is my personal favorite.) it’s so easy to get lost wandering around in all the beauty.  With spring slowly making its way into our lives, I’m sure there will be new buds popping up all over the place.
Beginning on April 2nd, the Old Westbury gardens will be open to the public on weekends and then on weekdays too starting on April 25th.  Check it out! 🙂 See you next week!

Here at C.W. Post, students are pretty lucky we don’t have to a pay a fee for parking. Some schools such as CUNY Queens and St. John’s University require students to pay a fee for the whole year. Others, such as NYU and Columbia University located in the city, don’t even offer parking permits. Finding parking is up to you, good luck! It’s almost impossible to drive in the city, so public transportation is pursued. Here at Post, plenty of parking is available, but it does a leave a problem for those of us who are always late to class.
Parking lots are located a good distance from the main buildings, Pell, Humanities, and Kahn. Those who get to school early are able to get in the smaller lots, which are a hop, skip, and a jump away from the main academic buildings. Those who park after 11:00 are stuck in the large parking lot away from everything. Some students get really creative and make their own parking spaces on grass or park illegally. A student who wished to remain anonymous says, “It’s not fair these students park like this everyday and never get tickets. But I have to say if you park in a spot that is not labeled you will most likely get a ticket.” Public Safety is always driving or bicycling around to make sure students haven’t forgotten the rules.
Now that the weather is becoming nicer, maybe we’ll all park a little further away and enjoy the nice views that C.W. Post offers or maybe we’ll still be late because the beach just looked like a much better place to go to before class. Commuters we want to hear from you! Send us questions, comments or responses at cwpstpnr@gmail.com.

On Sunday March 6th, the C.W. Post dance team competed in the New England Dance Championship. On the way up to the competition they stopped in Bridgeport, Connecticut to cheer for the Men’s and Women’s basketballs teams to their ECC victories. But after watching a win it was time to take home a victory of their own.
They competed against such schools as Oneonta and Adelphi and by the end of the day they danced their way into a second place victory in the open jazz competition, missing first by just three points to Endicott College, and winning best choreography out of any college team at the competition.
After a long day the twelve girls on the team, Coach Kelley May, and Assistant Coach Tara Macfarlane were nothing but smiles and full of excitement. The girls had used a routine they had been working on months before the competition. The team started practicing for the competition just a few weeks after winter break and practiced for three hours every Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday until the competition, giving their all at every practice so that they would hear their names called into the winners circle.
After all the hard work finally paid off and the girls received their well-deserved trophies, Coach Kelley May was quoted as being “thrilled with their performance and hard work ethic the girls had learned in the competition process. Their commitment and dedication to the team really paid off in the end.” One dancer, Briana Nussbaum was “so excited! We all threw our arms in the air and cheered with excitement! We couldn’t believe it! It was the best feeling!”
Most importantly all the girls were just glad that their hard work really did pay off. “Coming in second place, only losing by 0.3, was amazing-all of our hard work, time, and dedication had paid off and we all couldn’t have been more proud…,” dance team member Emily Sciortino said.  Captain Rosanne Goodman not only attributed their success to the team’s hard work and perseverance but to their coach. “I want to thank our coach Kelley for becoming a part of our team this year and completely transforming us into a collegiate team. She’s an incredible coach who is not only talented but also committed to the success of each dancer on the team. She’s been an incredible asset to our team.”
Next year the dance team will look to add to their victory by going to Orlando, Florida and competing in the Universal Dance Association Nationals. Right now the team is looking forward to auditions on Saturday April 9th from noon until four in the Pratt Multipurpose room, where anyone with any form of dance experience can try out become part of the team.

Commencement is an important day for all parties involved.  To the students, it may signify the most important milestone of their lives so far. To the C.W. Post family, it marks a new beginning. This year it was proposed that students were going to wear Eco-friendly gowns, made of 100 percent post-consumer recycled plastic bottles.
Provost Dr Paul Forestell finds this to be a great way to show our campus’ commitment to sustainability. The color, feel and fit of these new gowns are identical to the traditional gown worn by graduates at previous commencements. These Eco-friendly gowns are made by Oak Hall Cap and Gown and are called GreenWeaver gowns. They are indistinguishable from the polyester traditional gowns, and they are helping the environment as well.
“Personally, I don’t care. It’s only for a short amount of time. If it’s helping the environment then I don’t mind, it’s all good,” said senior Abriel Bello. These new gowns, which are spun from molten plastic pellets, are a great way to turn trash into keepsake items, which graduates may cherish forever.
A C.W. Post press release last month, declared that if 1,500 students wear these gowns at commencement this year, it will equal to an estimated 34,500 water bottles that will not end up dumped in a landfill. The GreenWeaver includes features like a softer and more breathable feel than the normal polyester gowns. They are also “tag-less,” meaning no annoying itchy size tags by your neck. Instead the gowns are stamped with soy ink. Oak Hall made a promise that for each gown bought this year, they will make a donation to our campus sustainability program. The new Greenweaver gowns are fairly new and have no reported downsides to them yet. Post students will have to judge for themselves how they feel about these new commencement outfits.
Going Green seems to be the new trend in which every student should take part. Without Eco-friendly cars, water bottles, light bulbs, or even graduation gowns this world may be heading for a downfall. It’s the little things like purchasing Eco-friendly caps and gowns that help save the world. For more information on the new line of Eco-friendly, items visit http://oakhalli.com/greenweavermovement.php.

At the beginning of this year, students at C.W. Post got their hands on one of Apple’s newest software on the market. Post also offered classes to help students become better educated on how to navigate their way around their new Ipads. The buzz about the Ipad is starting to cool down on campus and we have not heard much of it since. There have been discoveries of different applications, which help students with schoolwork, study skills and even daily diet and exercise. The Ipad offers apps that make personal and academic life all a little bit easier.
“I take it to class and work, it’s small and convenient for doing my homework,” said sophomore Kaitlyn Kudlek. “I use apps like the notepad, fitness pal, safari and games.” It can be hard for many students to balance the overload of schoolwork along with good eating habits and health. Try downloading an application called “Burn and Eat Plus” which keeps track of the calories that are burned and consumed. You can type in what exercise you fit into your day, along with the amount of calories you ate. It will provide you with the equivalent food list to show what healthier foods you could eat instead. As far as your personal life goes, there are many different applications to cater to whatever needs you may have.
There are many Ipad applications that can benefit students academically as well. “I use it to study by downloading apps for my anatomy class,” said sophomore Katelynn Rufle. “The app includes body parts and interactive hands-on learning, which help me understand information better.” For students interested in this application, it’s called ModalityBODY, and can be downloaded on the Apple website.
For students that find themselves disorganized or forgetting when things are due at school, try the iStudiez Pro. This application is a great way to take control of your busy schedule. It includes features like a built-in planner, GPA calculator and a notifications feature for when assignments are due. It even stores notes for each class and backs up your data should anything happens to your Ipad. Post students may also find applications like Audiotorium Notes, Convert Pad and Alarm Clock HD helpful for academic use. For more information on what applications are available to students, teachers and users log onto http://www.apple.com/ipad/.
Although iPads help students in their personal and academic life, some professors on campus have mixed feelings. “Ipads are not a distraction because I simply don’t allow them in class, if I did then students would play games,” said History Professor Richard Waldman.  Cell phones are a minuscule distraction when it comes to using Ipads in class. Students are given limitless games to play, and can access much more things on their Ipads rather than their phones. “Ipads are a good idea because students can be directly wired to tools like blackboard but just not during lecture, there’s no point,” Waldman said. In this case, C.W. Post students may want to check with a professor before using Ipads as a helpful tool in class.

Recently when we stop at a red traffic light, we’ve been noticing a flashing light immediately afterwards. Yes, cameras have been installed and are in use at many more Nassau traffic lights to catch red-light runners. “I think they are dangerous,” said Jad Greco, a sophomore biomedical technology major. “Yellow lights don’t last long, and most people either gun it or stop short.”
Apparently this offense is quite common in Nassau County and now the cameras will not only help to prove each case, they will also help to catch and fine the offenders. “It’s just a way to make money,” said Kelly Kuoppala, a junior criminal justice major. “I’ve gotten two tickets already. I’ve paid $50 for the first and $75 for the second.”
Do you need more to encourage you into actually slowing down at yellow lights and preparing to stop for red ones? Actually there is more!
Did you know that Nassau County traffic safety officials have installed video cameras along with still cameras at many intersections? Can you guess what they are finding when they look at the footage?
The videos are recording accidents that were caused when cars continued to drive through red lights and hit other cars either head-on or side-on. There is no doubt which car caused the accident in each case. No debate will arise from these accidents; each driver in violation will not be able to claim “my light was still green.”
If you’d like to view some footage of accidents recorded by cameras at intersections, please visit the website of the Nassau County Traffic and Parking Violations Agency at http://www.nassaucountyny.gov/agencies/TPVA/rlc-accidents.html.
Please encourage your friends and family to be safe and careful on the roads. Please also share this information with others to help save lives.

On March 10th, C.W. Post students were invited to a lecture hosted by the Media Arts Department introduced 2003 alumni Patrick Holbert. The lecture packed a full house in the small room in Humanities Hall. Holbert told the students of his journeys at Post and what he has experienced in the “real world” since he graduated.
Holbert has already worked for TV studios HBO, MTV, and VH1, but he started his love for the camera at C.W. Post’s PTV station. He says he fell in love with collaborating, writing, producing, and being a camera personality. While at Post, Holbert was always doing an internship. He started in his freshman year at VH1 and by his senior year he was doing a few internships at once.
After graduating he went to work for MTV on the popular television show “True Life.” Holbert showed the students clips from a few episodes that he has worked on. He said a few episodes were, “hard to shoot. Things could get emotional.” Holbert is able to pitch ideas to MTV producers and choose the people who star in these documentaries.
Holbert continues to work on MTV’s “True Life”, but he has also started his own media company called Miscellaneous Media.  The point of the company is to pitch new ideas, show the work of those who are involved in the company in order to get more work and inspire others to do work in the broadcasting field.
Holbert explained there a few downfalls to his career choice, although he loves what he does. Holbert explained, “You have to do things you don’t want to do first and then work your way up.” Holbert worked various jobs that he hated until he was offered the job of his life at MTV. For his job, he has to be on the road for months at a time, which can be hard to keep relationships. He joked that his ex-girlfriend hated his job.
By the end, students were full of questions, but Holbert exclusively told the Pioneer that what’s important in college is to, “write for the Pioneer, do radio shows at WCWP, work at PTV, learn stuff, don’t be shy, try to leave your comfort zone. Try to find what excites you.”

The Tilles Atrium was filled with faces beaming with excitement and a feeling of achievement was spread across the room on Thursday, March 10th. Everyone present had either worked towards helping a young woman accomplish something admirable by serving as a role model or were themselves being honored. According to C.W. Post Provost, Dr. Paul Forestell, these women all had “the whole package.” And what package was that exactly? Great achievement on the campus of C.W. Post.
The night was entitled “Making Your Mark: A Celebration of Women & Their Achievement” it was the Fifth Annual Women’s Achievement Dinner. A total of 49 young women were nominated from faculty or advisors to be honored as women of achievement and were given the opportunity to network amongst each other, eat great food, and participate in raffles. The dinner began at 5pm and after a welcome from Provost Forestell, Barbara DeMatteo, a guest facilitator, then started a networking activity. Each woman at the table was respectable in her own right but this activity gave them a chance to get to know one another if they hadn’t already. The activity was successful to many, especially sophomore, Angela Calise. “I really enjoyed it! I got to meet new people and network and I got to meet that I’ve known about because they were student leaders as well, but I never got to go up to them,” she said. Dinner then followed before Nassau County District Attorney, Kathleen M. Rice, began her speech.
As the first woman District Attorney on Long Island, she started by saying that she was no stranger to hard work and overcoming adversity. Although in many ways women have prospered in jobs and other areas, just like any man, there is still a pay discrepancy and woman are still paid 70 cents to every dollar a man is paid. The women in the audience, who are about to step out into the work force, found her advice about persistence to be very useful to them. “I thought she was a very powerful speaker,” said junior, Arianna Liveri, “She engaged the audience really well and I admire her accomplishments.” Some of those accomplishments included a heroin awareness program for parents, school children, and teenagers, as well as her receiving the United States Attorney General’s District Award.
The evening ended with a presentation of certificates to all the women nominated for their achievements. Two women were from our very own Pioneer staff, myself and Editor-in-chief Samantha Bishal, and we were joined by others like Ashley Deal (ACP President), Michelle Fucich, Eileen Lorito, and Amanda Ostapow – just to name a few. “It was a lovely event that expressed encouragement and support of our [campus’s] female student leaders,” said Ashley Deal. Finally various raffle items were given away from sponsors like Princess Nails & Spa, Starbucks, and the Tilles Center, among many others.
Speaking on behalf of myself and those I spoke to, the dinner was a great experience and a good chance for women on this campus to meet others like them who are just as driven as they are. The C.W. Post Employer Advisory Board and The Division for Student Success hosted a well planned program and I left reminded of Eleanor Roosevelt’s wise words: “You must do the thing you think you cannot do.” It was a great feeling to be acknowledged for doing something great with my time here.

The subject of love is sometimes touchy and boggles us all. Love is almost existential, as we never really have total concrete answers for it. It’s almost similar to topics of religion and looking for answers of “why.” In this case, its people wondering why they feel the ways they do. One thing, for sure, is that love exists, and many of us have once experienced it or are currently experiencing it. For those of us who have experienced it, chances are, we’ve also experienced heartbreak. In heartbreak, you have one of two experiences, ultimately. Either you’re sour towards love, or you have the understanding that, as you grow, you’re going to hurt. The best thing you can do is take lessons out of any hurtful situations.
Today, I want to speak about the underestimation of what love is. To me, love is such a cosmetic word to describe all the sacrifice and emotion it demands. The way love is depicted, most times, seems quite happy and carefree. Very few movies are ever shown that depict the real grit that’s involved in loving someone. The truth is that love isn’t easy, and to love is a decision. There comes a point where you have all these deep, crazy emotions, and you make a choice whether to accept them and emotionally invest them in someone or not to.
A lot of people take love for face value, meaning they love someone based on a superficial reason. These people become quickly enamored with someone, or so they think. The truth is that they’re in a fresh situation in which many things are going right. This is normal, but love really shows its face in the darkest of times. At that point, it isn’t what someone tells you but is more so the actions someone shows in your time of need. “People who fall into that Hollywood type of love are usually falling for infatuation,” says sophomore Ara McPherson. She has a point, but I think we’re all guilty of that feeling. It’s after you truly love someone that you figure out the order of events as it pertains to your emotions.
Two people meet, and in a perfect world, they hit it off. These positive vibes can last for whatever amount of time, but, eventually, this “love” you feel gets tested. It’s in this time where you see people’s true colors. “People play with it and assume it’s love when it really is[n’t] love,” says sophomore Samantha Vega. She goes on to say that many people seem to want what they can’t have and try to live their lives based on some fairytale. I agree to a degree, but there’s no manual on how to deal with our emotions. Unfortunately, we learn through experience, and, at some point, we all experienced that “fairytale.”
I think that, ultimately, love humbles you when you see how strong of an emotion it really is, and it’s even more humbling when you lose a love. I took a class here at Post as a sophomore called “Psychology of Love.” And, in that class, I learned that there is a chemical change in your body when you actually are in love. Levels of oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine (which gives the euphoric, pleasurable feeling) are increased. When that break up does happen, your body goes through a chemical change, again. As those levels of hormones are reduced, that horrible, sad feeling you do feel is similar to a withdrawal. Beyond missing this person, your body legitimately responds to the loss. I say that to say that love isn’t the sun-shiny thing you think it might be. Love is great, but love also elicits patience, understanding, and humility. In order to share a love with someone, you have to exercise all three of those traits.

From March 14- 21, you might think most students would have been celebrating spring break by traveling to different parts of the world or by relaxing at home, but think again. In actuality, some students traveled to Louisiana and helped to rebuild houses that have never been restored since hurricane Katrina. The devastating hurricane may have occurred back in 2005, but it was named one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the United States. Unfortunately, the hurricane killed 1,836 people. The amount of damage that occurred during hurricane Katrina amounted to about $81 billion.
Even though spring break was only one week long, C.W. Post students made a big difference in peoples lives during their time there. This was something I found admirable and decided to investigate it further, so I spoke with Jeanette Murray, who is the volunteer coordinator for the program and the assistant director of religious life.
I was not aware of how bad of a state Louisiana was still in after hurricane Katrina and the other two hurricanes that followed. Jeanette informed me that after the hurricane, people were inevitably left homeless, priceless possessions were ruined and houses were destroyed. Some people couldn’t afford to rebuild their homes, so they ended up leaving Louisiana, and their homes, behind.
This trip was advertised in the chapel, in flyers around campus, and, mostly, in Hillwood Commons. It cost around $400 and about 8 -10 students participated in this alternative spring break.
By way of these students going to rebuild hurricane ravished, abandoned homes, they have given some people, who had no homes or were living in shelters, a place to stay. The people living in Louisiana have been through a lot, so by volunteering to help, the students from C.W. Post gave these people a chance to start their lives over. After speaking with Jeanette and others who attended the trip, I began to wish I had taken the opportunity to go myself.  I was truly shocked to hear that some parts of Louisiana are still suffering from this disaster, and if I took it upon myself to go, I also could have made a difference. It will take a few years to fully restore Louisiana, but this was a great opportunity to see this wonderful, lively state with all that it has to offer and to help people in the process.
For those of you who think that alternative spring break takes away your vacation, you might want to think again. This is an opportunity that doesn’t really come around too often, and the personal benefit, aside from feeling like you’ve left your philanthropic mark on the world, is that you get to do it with a few friends.  All it takes is one person to step up and help, and others will follow suit. We can make a big difference in the world together. So, keep a look out for the next opportunity in fall 2011 to go to a different location and help make a difference.

The C.W. Post Baseball team won their first game of the season on March 9th in the Pioneers’ first home game of the season against Caldwell College. Junior starting pitcher Bo Budkevics tossed eight innings and struck out seven to lead the Pioneers to victory by a score of 5-2. The Cougars scored first off Budkevics in the first inning, surrendering one run. The Pioneers were held scoreless until the fourth inning, when the team scored three runs, led by sophomore third basemen Kevin Chenicek who finished the game 2-4 with two RBI’s and two runs scored. Freshman shortstop Tom Tolan finished the inning hitting a sacrifice fly to plate the Pioneers fifth and final run.
The Pioneers then flew down to West Palm Beach, Florida for a seven game tournament against some of the top competition in the northeast. The Pioneers opened the tournament with a double header against nationally ranked Southern Connecticut. The Pioneers stood toe-to-toe with the number 15 team in the nation, but came up short in both games, losing 3-1 and 4-3. Junior pitcher Bo Budkevics turned in another strong outing tossing seven innings striking out four and walking two. Both teams were scoreless through the first six innings of the game until the Pioneers broke through after a sacrifice bunt by sophomore transfer Matt Simone that moved Tolan to second after a leadoff single. Sophomore Casey McKay singled in Tolan to take a 1-0 lead that wouldn’t stand for long as the Owl’s answered right back, thanks to a bases loaded single that brought in two runs while scoring an insurance run in the eighth inning to seal the win for the Owl’s. In game two, the Pioneers scored first again after a leadoff double by Simone followed by a Casey McKay single to center in the bottom of the third. The lead was once again short lived. The Owls tied the game in the top of the next frame and went on to win the game by a final score of 4-3. Offensively the Pioneers were led by sophomore catcher Anthony Corona going 3-4 at the plate. The Pioneers would go on to drop their next five games to St. Michaels College, two more to Adelphi University, Umass Lowell, and nationally-ranked Franklin Pierce.
The Pioneers had a tough Florida trip, but the team is looking forward to conference play as they begin their quest to repeat as conference champions against starting pitcher Gabriel Duran and the Dowling College Golden Lions at home on Wednesday, March 23rd, at 3 p.m.

The C.W. Post women’s lacrosse team began its season against Georgian Court on Wednesday, March 9th, at Hickox field with a 16-5 victory. In the victory, everything went smoothly for the third-ranked Lady Pioneers, as junior Lauren Spagnoletta scored four goals and freshman Jackie Sileo walked away with seven points in the victory.
Sileo continued her impressive play to begin her Lady Pioneers career in the next game against Southern New Hampshire, on March 12th. In the 24-16 Pioneer victory, Sileo had another eight points, bringing her total to 15 points in two games and earning herself the honor of East Coast Conference Rookie of the Week.
Against Southern New Hampshire, the Pioneers exploded in the first half with 16 goals, earning a ten-goal lead heading into halftime.  Spagnoletta had another big game, scoring four times in the first half and finishing with a total of 10 goals in the game. In the blowout victory, Michelle Fucich, Abigal Ross, and Nan Mayott all scored multiple times.
This past Sunday, March 20, the Lady Pioneers hosted the Lock Haven Lady Eagles. The Pioneers came into the game on a two game winning streak, and moved up a spot in rankings, to second in Division II lacrosse. The Lady Eagles came in to the game ranked fourth, but could expect that spot to move up after beating the Lady Pioneers 17-11
Both teams exchanged goals in the first half and saw the lead change hands numerous times. By halftime, however, the score was tied up. In the second half, the Post offense sputtered and the Eagles took advantage of numerous interference penalties by the Lady Pioneers to gain the lead and never look back.
The road doesn’t get much easier for the Lady Pioneers; they get ten days to recover from the disappointing loss to Lock Haven before facing conference rival Bridgeport on March 30th at home on Hickox Field.

The C.W. Post men’s lacrosse team is currently 9-0 to begin the season. The Pioneers are 2-0 within the East Coast Conference, beating Seton Hill and Chestnut Hill College earlier in the year. The Pioneers have outscored their opponents by nearly 10 goals per game. Their most lopsided win on the season came with a 21-3 clobbering of Mesa State College in an early-season tournament in Arizona last month.
In the Pioneers’ latest matchup, on Saturday, March 19th, they beat St. Michael’s College 10-4. Right from the start, this game was all Pioneers. Post had better shot opportunities, and made them count more than the Purple Knights. The Pioneers clearly had the advantage as they put 30 shots on goal, compared to the Purple Knights’ 19 shots on goal. Junior attacker Eddie Plompen outscored the entire St. Michael’s Purple Knights team with five goals of his own. Senior midfielder Mike Messina also played well as he netted two goals and dished out two assists. The defense played a fantastic game holding the Purple Knights to only four goals. Senior goalkeeper Mike Giordano made ten stops in goal for his ninth win of the season.
On March 16th, the Pioneers faced off against the St. Anselm Hawks. The Pioneers rolled right through St. Anselm with an easy 10-2 victory. Messina played another solid game as he had the game-high in goals, with three; to lead the first-ranked Pioneers to yet another win. In this non-conference matchup, the Pioneers played it like any other game by dominating the ball. There was another huge disparity in the amount of shots on goal between the two squads; the Pioneers attempted 40 shots, while the Hawks were limited to only 14 shots. The Pioneers swarming defense, along with the stellar play of Giordano, will make the Pioneers an extremely difficult team to defeat in 2011.
The next game on the schedule for the Pioneers is on Saturday at 1 pm against the Dowling Golden Lions. The Golden Lions are currently 5-1 on the young season, but they are coming off a loss to the NYIT Bears 10-7 on Saturday. The Pioneers are ranked number one in the ECC with a perfect 9-0 record.

The C.W. Post women’s swimming team placed 26th last week at the NCAA Championships in Palo Alto, Texas.  The event, which ran from March 9th to March 12th, drew the best swimmers from across Division II together to compete on one stage.  The Pioneers were able to walk away with three Honorable Mention All-American nods.
Senior Riley Cassidy started the success off for the Pioneers, coming in 15th in the 100 Fly, an event she currently holds the team record for, and earning the Pioneers their first Honorable Mention of the event.  Sophomore Cornelia Hanes brought home the next Honorable Mention All-American title for the Pioneers, placing 16th in the 100 Free with a time of 23.73, a new C.W. Post record.
Finally, Hanes and Cassidy teamed up with freshman Tamara Garriock and sophomore Mairi Morrison to earn three more Honorable Mention All-American Awards.  The relay team’s first award came in the 200 Medley Relay, in which the Pioneers walked away with a 13th place finish.  Next, Post took 16th place in the 400 Medley Relay, earning the program its 4th Honorable Mention nod of the Championship.  Lastly, the team competed in the 200 Free Relay, finishing 14th overall and earning Post its 5th, and final award.
The NCAA Championships marked the end of the 2010-2011 season for the Pioneers.  The team finished with a 3-7 overall record in which they went 0-6 away and 0-1 at neutral locations, but managed to maintain a perfect 3-0 record in their home pool.

The C.W. Post Pioneers men’s basketball team made a nice run for the season, but it has come to an end. On Saturday March 12th, the eighth seeded C.W. Post Pioneers squared off against the top seed in the East Region of the NCAA Division II Basketball Tournament, the Bentley Falcons. Despite their playing a great game, ultimately the Pioneers fell short by a final of 74-60. This was a back-and-forth game for the first half. However, in the second half the Falcons pulled away by outscoring the Pioneers 36-27.
These teams were evenly matched the entire night as both squads grabbed the same number of rebounds and shot the exact same percentage from the field, 43 percent, while having the same number of shot opportunities (26-61). In the end, however, the Falcons made their shots count more than the Pioneers did. The Falcons made nearly half of their twenty attempted three-pointers. Looking at the Pioneers, they shot a dismal 3-17 shooting from beyond the arc. In addition, the Pioneers did not get to the free-throw line nearly enough as they were 5-8 from the charity stripe. The Pioneers relied on the perimeter shooting, but it was to no avail. However at halftime, the Falcons were only leading by five points with the score 38-33.
During the second half, the Falcons showed why they were the number one seed in the East Region. They pulled away and led by as much as 15 points behind timely shooting and solid defense. The Pioneers did not go down without a fight, though. They hung around during the final minutes of play, as the Falcons had a tough time finishing off the Pioneers. The Falcons would go up by double digits, but the Pioneers would respond on the other end by cutting the deficit to within reach.  With just over four minutes left to play, the Falcons were leading 65-54, but the Pioneers nailed back-to-back shots to cut the lead down to only seven with over three minutes left to play. However, the Falcons put the game out of reach by their soft touch from the perimeter, and the Pioneers ran out of time to make a comeback.
Junior guard Sam Leclerc led the way for the Falcons, putting up the game-high in points with 20 on 6-10 shooting from the field, 3-4 from three-point range. Senior forward Brian Tracey gave the Falcons toughness inside by scoring 17 points and grabbing a game-high 9 rebounds.
For the Pioneers, junior guard Stefan Bonneau, who earned the honor of East Coast Conference Player of the Year, finished with 16 points while shooting 7-16 from the floor. The only other player in double figures for the Pioneers was freshman Vaughn Allen, who concluded the game with 12 points while managing to secure seven rebounds in his 23 minutes of action.
Although the Pioneers came up short, they can’t be disappointed with how their season ended up. This loss ends the Pioneers fantastic season as they finished with a 21-10 record, and a 16-5 record within the East Coast Conference. The 2010-2011 season marks the fourth consecutive year the Pioneers have won at least 20 games. The Pioneers advanced into the NCAA Division II Tournament by beating the Bridgeport Purple Knights 68-64 on March 6th in the East Coast Conference Championship.

It’s that time of the semester again. A time when everyone on campus is running around asking their friends what classes they are taking next semester. A time when everyone is trying to pick the classes they need to graduate and the classes they need for their majors. But what do you do if you don’t have a major yet? Do you just take core classes until you figure it out? Do you take a bunch of classes to see what you enjoy? Do you talk to an academic counselor? Or what if you asked students themselves what they think of their major? After all what could be better then hearing the information from someone who is going through it? Well here is a time saver for you; nothing beats the real opinion of real students’ right in your hands!
Post has 92 undergraduate programs, ranging from sciences, to education, to arts, and even a program in film. Sophomore film major Dontae Hawkins, had many great things to say about his program. On top of saying that he enjoys the program very much, that the professors are always willing to help you, and that they are great at teaching their subject matter, Hawkins said that he would recommend this major to other students because it “gives you the skills necessary for a film career” and because “the professors are good references and a good network because they are very integrated into the field.” The only problem Hawkins had was that he wished that the program had more updated equipment. So if film and making movies is something you are very interesting in, it may be something to look at, but what if it’s not your thing?
Maybe you prefer a career in a more still version of film, such as photography. Michael Difilipo and Brittany Lee Dembowski are both sophomore photo majors with very similar view of the program. They both agree that the professors are good at teaching their subject matter but the program itself is difficult because every professor has a separate set of expectations and each class requires a lot of different work. They also both agree that the program may need some updating and both would like to see more digital photography classes. They also warn that there are extra fees that go along with many of the classes; this includes film and lab costs. So if you want a program with a little challenge and don’t mind paying a little extra then maybe photography is your calling.
Maybe you would rather be in a classroom, such as Gina Barsattee, a junior childhood education major. One part of her program that she was very happy with is her professors. “They are awesome, some are intense but they are all willing to help you, all are experienced in their fields, and they all want students to do well.” Barsattee highly recommends this program, “but be prepared for a lot of writing.” She also says that it is “important to get in as early as possible because there are a lot of requirements, full course loads, and seminars to do if you want to graduate on time.” So if you are a freshman this program is perfect for you to start in. Even if you are a sophomore, junior, or senior this is a great program to get into as long as you don’t mind spending a little extra time.
Maybe you want a more centralized and specific form of education. How about art education? Sophomore art education student Briana Nussbaum who would recommend her program to students “this program has everything needed in order to ensure a great education.” Nussbaum not only likes her program but thinks the professors are great as well. “The education courses I have taken in this program have been the most demanding classes I have ever taken. There is a reason why there is so much work for these courses; it is because there is so much material that is imperative for all aspiring teachers to have knowledge of. These professors teach not only what to teach, but how to teach and why it is important.” She also says that the professors are always there to help you when you need it. She also believes that the program prepares you well for the future. So if you enjoy art and teaching then this could be the perfect spot for you.
Ok, so education isn’t quite your thing but what about being a police officer, or even a federal agent. Juniors honor student and criminal justice major Mathew Brooks says that the program is “very intriguing and keeps you interested.” He also says that the “professors are the most honest people I know and understand what we are trying to accomplish and sacrifice and are trying to be a good resource…90% of professors fit the requirement for teaching, the other 10% spend time telling stories to keep their youthfulness.” Brooks spoke well of program but only wished that program had more internships for students. Overall Brooks thinks that the program is a “great program. Wouldn’t pick any other program over it.” So if you want to help the people and get on to the streets as an officer of the law Post has the program for you.
But what if you have more scientific aspirations? Shannon Hermansen, a senior forensic science major with a minor in chemistry, has these kinds of aspirations. Hermansen started by saying that “the course material itself is difficult, but make sure you have the right prerequisites for each course.” She also stated that some of the professors “have a wealth of knowledge but some need to retire, others are willing to give knowledge and want to tell you so much but it’s hard to comprehend it.”  Hermansen went on to say that a lot of the learning in the program is done with peers. Overall she thinks that the program is a good program. So if you don’t mind a bit of difficulty then this could be the right fit for you.
Or you could want to go into a more legal or political field, such as political science. In which case you may be taking classes with Dr. Amy Freedman, a political science professor who teaches courses on international relations and various subjects on Asia. Dr. Freedman started off by saying that she believes the political science program is “a great program, it helps students think about the world and the local world as well…it prepares students for law school, because it asks for writing, complex thinking, and critical analysis. The program also prepares students well for masters programs and is good at connecting students to internships.” The only thing Dr. Freedman warns about is that the program alone doesn’t quite prepare students for a PhD. She says that the quantitative skills necessary aren’t emphasized as much but can be taken and gained by taking classes in various other fields. Dr. Freedman does highly recommend the program because it “teaches students about the world around them.” So if you are interested in learning about the world, then this is program for you.
This is only a taste of what Post has to offer. There are still many, many different majors to choose from but no matter what you chose as you long as apply yourself you can definitely succeed.

C.J. Wolfinbarger, a sophomore childhood education major, was a first time donor during the blood drive that took place from March 8th to 9th in Hillwood Commons.  She explained that she had never donated before, but definitely would again adding that, “The worst part was probably the finger prick.”
However, not everyone gave the gift of life, and the staff on hand noticed it.  Susan Callis, a donor specialist for the Long Island Blood Services Center, said that there was a noticeably smaller turnout by both students and staff.  “The goal we had set was 130 pints and we had ultimately hoped for the two-day total to do 250 [pints],” adding that while she didn’t have any final totals available, it did not seem that they would be meeting those goals.
Callis commented on the lower numbers saying that she believed a large part of it probably had to do with the fact that the event was planned for right before spring break.  “It’s the week before spring break, and a lot of people probably got away a little early,” Callis said.
According to the mayo clinic only 5 percent of eligible donors will donate in their lifetime and for every pint of blood donated as many as three lives can be saved.
While people like C.J. Wolfinbarger plan on donating blood again, a statistic from the American Red Cross states that 30 percent of people who have donated once will never donate again.
Previous drives on the C.W. Post campus, like the one hosted in January of this year, were more successful said Callis, who also commented that the Center is hoping to coordinate another blood drive before the semester is over.
