A new web show, “435 The Series,” released a casting call to students on campus. Those looking for their 15 minutes of fame, a fun way to make money or something to do in their free time have the chance to take part in bringing this script to life.
The series is based on a true story which focuses on the lives of six inner-city teens who are the first in their families to attend college, while also trying to stay out of trouble and harm’s way given their newfound independence.
Godwin Bortey, writer, and Ramel Newerls, story creator, hope to impact young adults with their story, referring to the series as “a revolution” on its official website.
“The series shows what goes on that no one talks about during college,” Joseph Dancy, a member of the crew, said.
The 435 series gives an inside look on the life of a college student. In the age of streaming television, a web series based on a true story in a college setting might be an innovative way to grab a student’s attention.
“It is so important to be creating a college series that is about real college experiences,” Taya Simmons, the director, said. “There is so much that people don’t talk about; what we go through.”
Zae Diggs, the actor who portrays Melo, said students can relate to the story line in many ways. Specifically, “The aspect of what it’s like to have freedom for the first time and be independent, financial struggles, peer pressure, joining fraternities and the party life,” he said.
Filming on campus will occur in Humanities Hall, according to Diggs, who encourages students to take advantage of the opportunity.
“It’s something fun they can do on campus and make money at the same time. A lot of students have creative passions but no real outlet and this can be something that plants a seed,” he said.
Students interested in joining the mailing list for “435 The Series” can visit the website and enter their email into the pop-up box. Once registered, students will receive information regarding shoot dates, times and locations. These emails will also notify students of the required attire to wear or bring and how they’re expected to act in their particular role.
Compensation for a day of shooting is between $50 to $100, depending on the circumstances.
“We want to say thank you so much to Theresa Duggin. If it was not for her, we would not be able to have this amazing opportunity,” Simmons said.

Students on campus were a no-show to the Democratic debate watch party held by the Student Activities Board on Feb. 25 in the fish bowl. As some students plan to vote in the upcoming primary election, zero made the effort to weigh out their opinions alongside their peers.
A few factors may have contributed to lack of student interest in the debate. Everything from the long list of candidates to the disarray that occurs between members of the same party can affect someone’s decision to pay attention.
Ashley Rodriguez, president of the Student Government Association, said politics are a touchy subject.
“A lot of students may not feel comfortable being in a politically charged environment,” she said.
This was the tenth debate for the Democratic primary candidates that remained. Progressive senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren joined their moderate opponents Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, and former Vice President Joe Biden on the debate stage in Charleston, South Carolina. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg also participated, making this his second attempt at winning over potential voters.
Each candidate took turns sparring over key policy areas including healthcare costs, gun control and foreign affairs. All seven candidates spoke over each other throughout the duration of the event, making for a heated debate.
Several candidates expressed their opposing views to Sanders, the current frontrunner, over the cost of his healthcare proposal and how he plans to pay for it. Others squared off with Bloomberg over a range of his past policies including “stop and frisk,” as well as his massive wealth which pushed his opponents to brand him as paying his way into the primaries.
“Politics stress me out due to the polarity of the views,” Sarah Ren, junior psychology major, said. “Also being a busy college student, I spend a lot of time reading more books that relate to my studies than what the news provides, so I wouldn’t even know what to say about what is happening right now.”
It’s possible the bickering between candidates of the same party is what deterred students from attending the watch party. But another reason may be that “Student involvement has not been the greatest on this campus and definitely has room for improvement,” Rodriguez said.
In the end, major news outlets determined there was no clear-cut winner, except for some who claimed Biden made a powerful comeback. Biden’s victory in South Carolina was a presumed certainty; a factor that commentators credited for his improved and confident debate performance. He ended up winning the state by a landslide on Saturday, Feb. 29.
Following Biden’s triumph in South Carolina, Buttigieg, Steyer and Klobuchar all dropped out of the race, allowing moderate voters to condense behind Biden or Bloomberg.
The non-turnout is an alarming factor, as college students made up 40 percent of voters in the 2018 elections, according to insidehighered.com. The Democratic party needs the younger generation to vote, as they could be the deciding factor in the 2020 presidential election.
“I think more advertising will help students generate interest,” Rodriguez said, “And possibly hosting more events in regards to why it is so important to be involved with politics.”

As the 2020 primary and presidential elections are quickly approaching, the university is encouraging students, faculty and staff to register for their right to vote. A tabling event to register for the primaries is scheduled for Monday, March 30, and another is scheduled for the presidential election on Thursday, April 2. Both will take place in Hillwood Commons from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m.
LIU Votes is a campus-wide marketing initiative to promote participation in the election process. At the tabling events and on their website, www.liu.edu/votes, voter registration and absentee ballot applications are available for all 50 states.
According to Best Colleges, in 2017, 16.8 million undergraduate students were enrolled to vote nationwide, but actual voter turnout was poor. On the upside, the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement (NSLVE) calculated that 40.3 percent of registered student voters took the time to cast their ballots in 2018, doubling the percentage that voted in 2014.
Both studies concluded that a number of factors contribute to the low student turnout such as a dislike for the candidates, voting barriers, hectic schedules, heavy workload, and changing policies that confuse young people on how to vote.
On campus, students expressed different reasons for whether or not they participate in the voting process.
“Well, I don’t follow politics so I don’t feel like I can make a good informed decision,” Lauren Ramirez, junior accounting major, said.
Those who voice strong opinions against candidates usually don’t go out of their way to vote, according to Joseph Campisi, sophomore biology major. He finds it ironic that people can hold strong viewpoints on how to “better the world” but neglect to participate in a way that actually counts.
“I think everyone should vote in every election to express their right to do so, and to voice their opinions on matters that affect us all as a country,” Campisi said.
College students tend to be occupied with studies, sports and extracurricular activities, leaving them with little time for anything else.
“I am not registered to vote as I have not had the chance due to a busy schedule and have not made this a priority,” Alex Price, sophomore business major, said. He explained further that he plans to register and vote in the upcoming elections.
Understanding each candidate’s proposed policies and viewpoints is also an important part of the voting process. Students should make sure they’re electing the right person with the right values for the job, according to Michael Soupios, professor of political science.
“Which means in addition to voting, young folks must do their research…the last thing the Republic needs is another generation of mountebanks and political scoundrels leading the nation,” he said.
Ashley Rodriguez, president of the Student Government Association (SGA) and senior accounting major, said, “SGA believes that it is very important to promote voter registration. Last semester we hosted a tanking event with the paperwork needed to help students register to vote.”
Rodriguez emphasized why her fellow classmates shouldn’t hesitate to enter the voting booth. Often, students accept the notion that their single vote doesn’t count, when in actuality this is far from the case.
“Every single vote matters and can make a difference,” she said.
Heather Felix, senior public relations major, agreed with Rodriguez, but credited the low voter turnout to her belief that college students don’t care enough about politics because they don’t think it affects them.
“This is entirely untrue as our representatives are responsible for policies and legislation which shape the social landscape and economy we will enter into after graduation,” Felix said.
“It is important for college students to make educated decisions, not just align with their parents’ political beliefs, and vote for candidates who they believe are most capable. Our right to vote is taken for granted when so many fought for that privilege. Registering to vote is also so easy. There’s no excuse.”
In the United States, it’s valuable to remember that voting is a right and privilege that is not mandatory, but is highly suggested. In several other countries like Australia, Argentina and Belgium, voting is compulsory and failure to vote results in penalties.
“It is very important to register and vote,” Soupios said. “Young people better remember when old people such as myself go off to the bone garden, the system belongs to them.”

The Department of Public Safety offers a student escort service Monday through Thursday, with the exception of holidays, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. These escorts walk students, faculty members and visitors safely to their classes, vehicles or dorms after dark.
A student escort is a paid position, and since the position was vacant for a year and a half, the job has been posted to the LIU employment site, according to James Contarino, a public safety lieutenant.
The campus concierge in Hillwood Commons offers an escort service where a student worker is available Monday through Thursday from 12:30-6 p.m. to help their fellow students.
The idea of being escorted by a fellow student places some student’s nerves at ease. “I think it would be helpful to create jobs and to help people feel more secure, because there’s safety in numbers,” Sean Clare, a freshman journalism major, said.
Some students tend to leave areas like the library, radio station or athletic fields late at night. Trusting that a public safety officer is available when needed draws the department’s attention away from other areas of concern.
“I feel the public safety officers can be wrapped up in other things, so it would be useful to have a service specifically for walking people to safety,” Lewis Eldridge, a senior film major said.
Tierra Gillet, a sophomore business management administration major, agreed with Eldridge. “Public Safety does do their job, but they cannot be everywhere, and they’re usually called in specific situations.”
Some students were unaware that the option to request an escort on campus existed. Eldridge said “I haven’t heard of it or seen it anywhere,” he said when he first learned about the service.
“I would suggest getting the word out that those services are available,” Gillet said. “I’m sure more people who are experienced with the campus would love to help.”
Any current students interested in working in the student led escort program should contact the Department of Public Safety, according to Michael Fevola, director of public safety. He said students should call between the hours of noon and 8 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and ask to speak with James Contarino, the lieutenant who supervises the program. Anyone looking to fill the vacancy can expect to work from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Thursday.
Until student escort positions are filled, public safety officer escorts are also available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. To request a public safety officer escort, students can call the public safety at 516-299-2222.
When student escorts are available, they can be requested by visiting the concierge desk in Hillwood Commons or by calling 516-299-2200 before leaving for a destination.

The Esports Club and The Rainbow Alliance teamed up to host a game night on Thursday, Feb. 27. “We have board games, Mario Party, food and more,” Nicole Ludwig, junior psychology major, said. “The main event we have here tonight is the Mario Smash Tournament that a lot of us are competing in for prizes.”
There were flyers for the event posted in Hillwood Commons and residence halls. The event was open to everyone to either sign up in advance or come in 30 minutes before the start of the event.
The first place winner of the tournament won a pair of headphones, second place won a mechanical keyboard, and third place won a portable speaker.
The event raised money for charity and the club’s budget, though club members hoped to provide a positive environment for students as well. “We are also trying to have different kinds of social events. Part of the club isn’t LGTBQ+ oriented, but it’s creating that safe space where people can hang out together,” Ludwig said.
Later in the semester, students can expect a Rainbow Formal event at Molloy College. This is another project the Rainbow Alliance hopes to save up for.
“It’s a non-profit event and all of the funds go to the charity Pride for Youth,” Nicholas Frank, junior game design major and president of the Rainbow Alliance, said. “The Esports Club is doing a live stream online for 24 hours. They’re raising money the entire time for Extra Life.”
Students can check out the club’s Instagram @LIUPostRainbowAlliance for more information on future events. Ludwig invites any student interested in joining the club to stop by a meeting on Thursday at 12:30 p.m. in Hillwood.
“We are a safe space to the LGTBQ+ community and their allies. We welcome anyone and everyone,” Ludwig said.
The Esports Club is also looking for new members. Those interested can contact John McDermott at john.mcdermott@liu.edu.

Being a college student can be stressful. Classes, tests and projects can end up consuming all of your time. Luckily spring break is just around the corner to give students a break from the everyday responsibilities of being a student.
Some students who dorm on campus use their break as an opportunity to spend time with friends and family.
Theater major Anabel Vazquez will be returning to Miami where she will be meeting up with old friends and going to the beach.
Freshman musical theater major Sophie Stapler said she’s looking forward to seeing her family in Virginia again since they don’t get to spend enough time together.
Freshman biology major Ayyad Mulla plans on going upstate to Albany to visit family and go skiing.
Other students, such as sophomore business management major Brian Chang, plan on using the break to catch up with schoolwork.
“I’ll take most of the time to catch up with some homework. Maybe review my resume for my summer internship,” Chang said.
Student athletes, such as Bianca Comfuestea, will be using the time off to practice their sport. Comfuestea will be in Florida practicing tennis throughout the break.
Some students also plan on using the break to forget about school and relax, such as freshman musical theater major Zackery Deporter. Deporter plans on using the break to relax and not think about his major for a little bit.
Graduate student Monig Sankhe plans on going to Washington D.C. with friends.
“I will be at Washington D.C. for the spring break,” he said. “This is my first time in Washington D.C. so I’m planning to visit the Smithsonian and maybe go to the White House.”

The sculpture gallery hosted the art of Vanessa Gardner, senior photography major, from Monday, Feb. 24 to Sunday, March 1.
The exhibition was titled “Sfumato” after a painting style used by Leonardo Da Vinci. The technique is meant to bring the viewer’s eye past what it usually sees, something Gardner worked to accomplish by using smoke bombs in her art.
Gardner has been a photographer since she was 7 years old when she shot her first photos with a point-and-shoot Kodak camera. Her interest in photography continued to grow throughout high school, and after two years as a psychology major, Gardner switched to studying photography to follow her passion.
This show is Gardner’s first solo show, and although she has only been in one group show before “Sfumato,” she had more preparation than others doing the same thing.
“I had a little more preparation than everyone else because I thrifted all of the frames,” Gardner said. “I had to measure each frame and figure out which photo was going to go into each one beforehand.” Taking on this extra task allowed Gardner to have her exhibit planned out well before the show opened, and added another unique flare to her art.
While the frames added a pop to the collection, each photo that hung inside the frames had its own distinctive elements as well. “Each frame is unique, just like the smoke. The smoke changes every five seconds, and each of the models are unique too,” Gardner said.
The women in the photographs were cascaded in smoke of various colors, a technique Gardner discovered about five years ago.
“We were playing with gulal and she blew it at me and I took a picture of it and thought: how can I get this bigger?” Gardner said, recounting the time she was invited to celebrate Holi (a popular ancient Hindu festival) with her friend and model, Devita Mohandeo.
After that experience, Gardner bought smoke bombs and began trying to make that moment into something bigger. “It’s been a long time coming, work in progress. But I’m really happy to see it come together,” she said.
The show attracted a crowd of Gardner’s friends and supporters who were excited to see her work displayed.
“If you look around the room, this represents her,” Jacob Goldman, freshman nursing major, said.
Garner’s friend, Tenesha Walker, a biology major at the Brooklyn campus, attended the show to show support to her long-time friend.
“I know Vanessa’s been busting her brains out, overworking herself and stressing herself out to make this exhibit perfect.” Walker said, “I know she worked so hard for this, and she did it.”
Gardner took pride in her collection. “Every photo you’ve seen is a reflection of the artist who took it, and this, I think definitely, is a reflection of me,” she said.
The photos lining the gallery were all for sale and can be found on Gardner’s instagram page @vmgphoto_ as well as purchased through her email, vgardnerphotography@yahoo.com.

The Studio, an art-based student club, and Circle K, a community service organization, came together on Wednesday, Feb. 26 to hold a paint night in Hillwood Commons. The event was a fundraiser for Relay for Life and had canvases priced at $2 and raffle opportunities available for students.
The Studio’s goal was to get everyone on campus involved in art, no matter what their major or usual interests are. Members of the Studio hosted a paint night event in the past, but this was the first time they offered a crayon melting option, something that proved to be a popular success among attendees.
The paint night provided a way to promote artistic practices while also raising money for a cause.
“We’re a group of students who have a passion to spread creativity and the idea that art is not just for people who are excelling in it, it’s for everybody to express themselves,” Samantha Scarito, junior early childhood education major and treasurer of the Studio, said.
Beth Hillman, junior nursing major and president of Circle K, was excited to help host the painting event.
“It’s a fun event. It’s nice doing something different from community service, and we’re raising money but it’s still fun,” she said.
The paint night fulfilled the goals that members of the Studio had by bringing out students from all different majors to paint and color. Some drew with crayons and colored pencils, while others used hair dryers to melt the crayons over a canvas.
“It’s a creative atmosphere that inspires people in different ways,” Sophia Chianese, junior accounting major, said.
The event was a fun way for attending students to wind down, and it was something out of the ordinary for non-art majors.
“This is something different for me because I don’t take breaks to just color or relax as much as I should,” Chianese said.
Students used the event as a way to put their minds at ease for a moment. “It’s very relaxing and therapeutic,” Adam Silverstein, senior social work major, said.
Another table of temporary artists agreed. “It’s nice, it’s calming me down,” Michaela Zabicki, sophomore sports management major, said.
Students thought the event was well organized and an exciting way to raise money. “It’s a really fun and creative way to raise money for Relay for Life,” Silverstein said.

As Black History Month came to a close, the Krasnoff theatre was buzzing with performances celebrating black culture at the first annual African-American Read-In on campus. On Feb. 25, the event took place in two parts during the afternoon and evening.
The afternoon portion was a read-in featuring poet David Mills and student and faculty poets. Mills read four of his favorite personal works about the black community in America. He also spoke about the time he spent living in the home of Langston Hughes, a pivotal African-American poet who died in 1967. Mills used the opportunity to absorb the inspiring energy of his favorite creator.
Mills went on to speak of the pain that members of the black community experience, how society still treats them, and what they will do to stop the mistreatment.There was a question-and-answer segment by a younger poet called False Prophet. He asked Mills what advice he would give aspiring poets and young African-American performers.
“Watch great dancers if you want to be a dancer, read writings by great poets if you want to be a poet, do if you want to be,” Mills said.
The second event in the the evening featured holistic spiritualist Phoenixx Love and alumna Oya Bangura (’16), who performed traditional African dance.
The show opened with a performance by Long Island Uniondale high school band and their conductor Sapphire Greene. Afterwards, Love was interviewed by Faith Lynn Morris, third year graduate student, about the mental health of members of the African-American community, holistic practices to improve anxiety and meditation for a healthier and calmer mind.
After the events came to a close, Love spread the word on African-American mental health and struggles.
“When it comes down to people of color, there is another layer added onto already present human struggles,” Love said. “We are dealing with racism, discrimination, microaggression.” She said how the mental health community is not progressive enough when it comes to African-American individuals.
With February being Black History Month, Love said she is sure to be extra sensitive to her African American patients in her work as a holistic health consultant and licensed clinical social worker, making sure to honor them and their emotions.

Originally a novel by Lewis Carroll, the concept of “Alice in Wonderland” was published in 1865 and has since been adapted through numerous films and plays. On Saturday, Feb. 22, freshman musical theatre major Kevin DiCarlo directed an adaptation by Andrew Barbato and Lesley Anderson in the Rifle Range Theatre.
DiCarlo staged his production of “Alice” as part of the spring 2020 season for the Emerging Student Theatre Artists (ESTA). He proposed directing “Alice” because he was in a production of it in 2018. The musical was directed by Lauren and Stephen Markarian, who were both a part of the original cast of “Alice.”
“I’ll be honest, I cried,” DiCarlo said when remembering how excited he was to find out that ESTA approved his musical.
The opening show was at 2 p.m., and ran for approximately two hours. “Alice” follows the journey of a 13-year-old girl through a fantasy world she discovers after following a rabbit obsessed with being on time for an unknown event. Alice tries to shrink herself to get through a small door and eventually ends up in Wonderland.
She meets a ship captain and wants to sail to a beautiful garden owned by the Red Queen. Once on land, she meets a peculiar caterpillar who helps her grow to a normal human size and points her towards the garden. As she walks, she meets various humans and creatures, such as the Mad-Hatter at his tea party and Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum during their battle over who is the losing brother. These unique characters assist her in getting to the Red Queen’s kingdom to finally see the garden.
Once at the Kingdom, Alice realizes that the Red Queen rules her people by threatening to behead them. She stands up for the creatures of Wonderland and asks to see the queen’s garden. At the garden, she realizes the glorious flowers are actually dead and painted red, symbolizing Alice’s beliefs on what the real world should be like. The flowers then fully bloom as Alice realizes she must grow up and continue her life in the real world with her mother and older sister.
“What inspired me to do this show is the message,” DiCarlo said. “That growing up means taking hold of the things you dreamed of as a child.”
The production had intricate costumes for nearly every character and a detailed set that consisted of boxes decorated with a rose print and a decorated staircase. The cast worked with actions, dialogue, song, and facial expressions, so there were not a lot of props or set changes, according to the director.
Although DiCarlo has never directed a show before, he put in a lot of effort to refine the show and work with a cast primarily of freshman. “[The cast] made the whole process worth it for me because I got to see them … reap the benefits of the work they put in on the stage,” DiCarlo said.
With every new scene, song, or character arrival, the audience was eager and enthusiastic to see what would happen next in the musical. When Absalom the caterpillar walked on stage: the audience screamed with joy. The white rabbit and mouse captain brought members of the audience out of their seats to dance during one of the numbers.
“It was a great experience,” freshman musical theatre major BrayLynn Willis said. She played the white rabbit in this musical. “Our whole group put in so many hours and seeing everyone become their character and have the audience be so receptive to it was amazing.”
As the final bow occurred, signifying the end of the musical, the audience gave the cast a standing ovation.

The works of William Shakespeare have lived on for centuries in the worlds of literature and performance. In the first annual North Shore Student Shakespeare Festival, Post students in the advanced acting class as well as students from four local high schools performed Shakespearean monologues and scenes for each other. The event took place on Friday, Feb. 27 in the Krasnoff Theater.
The festival was hosted by David Seinfeld, director of school planning and partnerships, and was suggested by Josh Cabat, the chair of English for Roslyn Public Schools, to take place on campus. Seinfeld opened the event and welcomed the high schools. Students from Roslyn High School, Glen Cove High School, North Shore High School, and Manhasset High School were in attendance. Cabat expressed the sentiment that Shakespeare is only taught successfully through performance.
“We have the group from Dr. Pye’s acting class, [I look forward to] having that kind of interaction between the college and the high school students. This is exposure to the university for students who love theatre, and perhaps they’ll be semi-interested in the program here,” Seinfeld said.
After a collective warmup where all the participants intermingled and exchanged Shakespearean greetings and insults, Post theatre students performed first. Lauren Lehosky, junior acting major, performed selections from “Twelfth Night” and “As You Like It.” The class presented pieces they’d been working on since the fall 2019 semester. “We started them in September and finished them in December, but nothing’s ever really finished,” Lehosky said.
Matthew Fama, junior acting major, presented a soliloquy from “King Lear.” “It’s exciting to see high schools actually starting to get into Shakespeare because you rarely see that nowadays,” he said. “To see them come together and actually work with this heightened text for the first time, I think that’s really exciting and wonderful to see in young people.”
The stage was sparsely adorned with chairs lined up in a row for those waiting their turn to perform, as well as a single scenic bench. “Everything is in the text, so it’s not necessary to have some elaborate set,” Brandon Prater, junior musical theatre major, said. “Minimalism is the best way to go when starting out with Shakespeare, and you can build up from there.”
Though the event was not a competition, professors Valerie Clayman-Pye and James Bednarz provided positive responses and constructive criticism after each high school group’s performance. “I don’t think there’s a prize, I think it’s more about having the opportunity to get some feedback and to open a conversation about what it is to perform Shakespeare,” Pye said.
The high school students performed various scenes and monologues from Shakespeare’s tragedies and comedies, from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” to “Othello.” Students from Glen Cove brought prop swords to portray the opening fight scene from “Romeo and Juliet,” and participants from Manhasset wore elaborate costumes for their portrayal of a famous scene from “Hamlet.”
Beth Lambert, teaching assistant for the advanced acting class, was proud of the students who performed their work, and hopes to continue the festival in the future.
“I thought LIU did a great job demonstrating their support both for each other and for the high schoolers,” she said. “It was so great to see young, creative minds at work.”

Musical artist Justin Bieber dropped his new album entitled “Changes” on Friday, Feb. 14. The album debuted at no.1 on Billboard’s 200 list, a seven-time accomplishment for Bieber. A track on the album called “Yummy” ranked no. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 list.
R&B artist Usher discovered Bieber’s talent when the latter was 13 years old. Bieber’s debut extended play (EP) “My World” was released in November 2009, and Bieber was the first artist to have seven songs from the same album included on Billboard’s Hot 100 list.
Bieber transitioned from performing music within the teen pop genre to performing electronic dance music (EDM) in 2015 when his album“Purpose” dropped. “Purpose” was the latest album predating “Changes,” and three of its songs ranked on Billboard’s Hot 100 list.
While dealing with challenges involving anxiety, depression, and substance abuse, Bieber cancelled his tour for “Purpose” in 2017. Since then, he appeared in collaborations, but did not release any original work. Bieber also released a Youtube documentary called “Seasons” where he speaks about his marriage, psychological disorders, and reasons as to why he took a hiatus in his music career.
Shabnamm Nasary, sophomore nursing major, loves Bieber’s new album. She has enjoyed Bieber’s music since the release of “My World” in 2009. “I enjoy the collaborations with various artists like Travis Scott, Post Mahlone, and Kehlani, as well as songs ‘Come Around,’ ‘Habituation,’ and ‘All Around Me’,” Nasary said. “I have been waiting for this album to drop for so long, and I am not disappointed one bit: the Biebs is back.”
Kimberly Glasser, sophomore nursing major, also enjoyed the new album. “I got a little worried when I heard [his] single, ‘Yummy,’ because it was not as good as his previous work, but then Bieber redeemed himself with [the] songs ‘All Around Me,’ ‘At Least For Now,’ and ‘That’s What Love Is,’” Glasser stated. “However, many songs use similar beats to them, but overall I really love the album and I’m happy with what he released,” she added.
Mary Twetten, sophomore political science major, was disappointed with the new album. “I feel like I listened to the same song 16 times,” she said. “I was expecting more depth in this album, and for it to speak about his marriage as well as his depression and anxiety, instead we got ‘Yummy,’” Twetten said.
“I’ve been a fan of Bieber since his KidRauhl days and I feel like his latest work does not do him justice, I think a large reason as to why this album isn’t up to standard is because his new wife Hailey played a large role in producing it,” Twetten said. KidRauhl was Bieber’s original Youtube username before his career took off.
Bieber will begin his “Changes Tour” on May 14, in Seattle, W.A. and will end on Sept. 26 in East Rutherford, N.J. This tour will hit 45 different cities, including four provinces in Canada.

A strong third quarter made the difference for the women’s basketball team as they capitalized and earned a 66-52 win against Wagner College on Saturday, Feb. 29 at the Steinberg Wellness Center in Brooklyn, N.Y.
The Sharks improved their record to 7-9 in conference play and clinched a berth in the 2020 Northeast Conference Tournament. “All the team needed to do is focus on what we do best and they will clinch,” Head Coach Rene Haynes said.
Prior to Saturday’s contest, the team took the time to honor the graduating members of the women’s basketball program including graduate student Drew Winter and team manager Danielle Bray.
The Sharks opened the game strong, as sophomore Shyla Sanford and junior Mia Perkins scored the four first points. Wagner answered back with a 7-0 run to take a 4-7 lead during the first quarter.
The Sharks would shift back momentum with a 10-4 stretch over the next three and a half minutes for a 14-11 lead with more than two minutes left in the quarter. The Seahawks then had another 7-0 run to regain the lead, 14-18. Sophomore Ryan Weise scored a three pointer for the Sharks in the final seconds of the quarter, bringing the score to 17-18.
Both offenses slowed down in the second quarter, combining for 15 points in the frame. Wagner controlled the first couple of minutes of the second quarter, building up a 20-24 lead. The second part of the quarter was dominated by the Sharks who had a 6-0 stretch. To close the half, a layup from Johnson gave the team a 26-24 lead at halftime.
The Sharks picked up where they left off going into the third quarter, maintaining their forward momentum. They had a 25-0 run over the first eight minutes that boosted the team into the leading position.
The Sharks made 10 field goals and 4-of-5 on long distance during their third quarter run. Junior Jeydah Johnson tallied eight points and sophomore Kiara Bell along with junior Zhané Williams added four points as the Sharks took a 51-25 lead by the third quarter.
The Sharks continued to hold the advantage into the final quarter and earned a 66-52 win against Wagner College, earning themselves a berth in the NEC Tournament.
The Sharks were led offensively during the game by three scorers with double-digit statistics. Sanford tallied a team and career-high of 14 points during the game and made five assists. Johnson added 13 points along with three assists and Bell finished with 10 points and nine rebounds.
The women’s basketball team will close out their season on the road as they play for a better seeding in the NEC Tournament. The team will travel to Fairfield, Conn. for a matchup against Sacred Heart University on Thursday, March 6. The tip-off at the Pitt Center is scheduled for 11 a.m.

There was no shortage of things to celebrate for the men’s basketball team on Thursday, Feb. 27 as they came away with a victory over the Wagner College Seahawks on senior night with a score of 74-66.
The starting five for the Sharks represented the four seniors who will be graduating this year: Jashaun Agosto, Julian Batts, Ashtyn Bradley, and Ganlandou Cisse alongside regular starter Raiquan Clark. Also honored on Thursday was manager Maxime Tondre, another graduating senior.
The first half was dominated by the Sharks as they hit 54.2 percent of their shots, while the Seahawks only hit 23.5 percent of theirs. Their solid shooting propelled them to a nine-point lead, 34-25, going into halftime.
In the second half, the Seahawks got off to a quick start and scored five unanswered points. However, the Sharks retaliated and went on a 15-2 run, which put them up by 17 points with just under 14 minutes left to play.
Despite the deficit, the Seahawks answered and took advantage of the Sharks subbing their starters out. They went on a 24-5 run to make the game closer and managed to take the lead, 54-56, with six-and-a-half minutes to play.
However, the starters for the Sharks came back into the game and the momentum changed once again. The Sharks outscored Wagner 20-10 to close out the game and took the victory with a score of 74-66.
In addition to the win, the Sharks achieved personal milestones during the night. Junior Ty Flowers hit his 1,000th career point just before the 10-minute mark in the first half on a free throw and sophomore Jack Ballantyne recorded the first double-double of his career as he made 18 points and 12 rebounds, both career highs.
Ballantyne’s 18 points tied him for the team lead in points with Jermaine Jackson Jr., who also racked up 18 points, including going 7-for-7 on free throws. Raiquan Clark scored 14 points and 12 rebounds with 6 assists, while Flowers made 11 points.
The win also led to a guaranteed home game for the Sharks in the playoffs, as they secured the No. 4 seed in the NEC. The Sharks will host a playoff game against the No. 5 seed Fairleigh Dickinson University Knights on Wednesday, March 4 at 7 p.m. inside the Steinberg Wellness Center.

Thanks to a skillful play by women’s hockey goalie Kenzie Harmison, the Sharks ended their inaugural season on top by earning the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance (NEWHA) title.
Harmison won tournament MVP, achieving shutouts in all three matches, totaling 85 saves, helping her team to become the first Sharks team to win a Division I title in LIU athletics history.
After Harmison’s first three game starts, head coach Rob Morgan was pleased to notice her progression. “Kenzie began to focus on what’s in her control while keeping a positive outlook on the process of development and being the best at getting better each day,” he said.
Morgan said Harmison’s winning play “brought a lot of energy to the team with save after save, which made the team want to work even harder, especially on the defensive side of things.”
Harmison was the team’s best chance to win, and her energy radiated throughout the team, according to Morgan. “Kenzie made many highlight reel saves, especially during the penalty kills and in the last three minutes of the championship game,” he said. “It takes everyone in the locker room to win, and for us to have great goaltending on top of everyone bringing their best was the difference in the outcome.”
Harmison was excited to come to LIU because it gave her the opportunity to play on an inaugural Division I team, as well as the school’s close proximity to New York City. “LIU also had a great film program for me, so being close to New York City was just a bonus at that point,” Harmison said.
Despite being such a young team, Harmison was confident everyone could come together for a common goal. “Everyone came from their own backgrounds all over the world, but at the end of the day, we have all grown up playing hockey,” she said. “We have learned for years that if you work hard, things will go your way. By the end of the season, our hard work was rewarded.”
Like many other athletes, Harmison encountered struggles throughout the season, but the work she put in was well worth the outcome.
“There were many ups and downs this season but in the end I gave it my all and worked to help my team game by game,” she said. “Knowing that the amazing coaching staff had faith in me to give them a chance to win felt amazing.”
Harmison’s focus was at a maximum in order to maintain her precision and intensity for three long games. “Being a goaltender is really a mental game. You have so much time to think but then when a puck is coming towards you, you have less than a second,” she said. “My team was playing well, I had confidence in them and knew I had a supportive coaching staff behind me.”
Harmison attributed her consistent rhythm throughout the tournament to routine play toward the end of the regular season conference. Her effort in the final two regular season games allowed her to stay in a groove all week.
There’s no better feeling than to hold the championship trophy, according to Harmison, who put everything on the line to give her team the best chance to win.
“It’s an absolutely amazing feeling knowing that you were able to play such a key role in such a historic event,” she said. “There is such a huge weight lifted off your chest at the end of games like these.”
Harmison was honored to be named tournament MVP, but also said she couldn’t have done it without her teammates behind her, and considers the award “just a personal bonus.” Her expectations are high for herself and her team going forward.

The wrestling team is preparing to compete in the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Conference Championship, held from Friday, March 6 to Saturday, March 7 at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania.
Besides winning a conference championship, the athletes can qualify for the NCAA tournament during the days of competition. Based on individual performances the tournament decides which wrestlers will move onto the NCAA tournament.
The competing Shark athletes are seniors Dominick Demarco and Dan McClure, junior Mark Malico, sophomore James Langan, redshirt freshmen Ryan Ferro and Maguire Horl, and freshmen Michael Blando and Rhise Royster.
Malico, a health science major, said he feels confident going into the tournament and that he and the team are well-prepared for the physical challenge that awaits. “I feel great, as a team we have been training one to two times per day,” he said. Malico said their training consists of running, lifting weights, doing calisthenics, yoga, and swimming.
Another athlete who is excited about the tournament is Horl, a history and secondary education major, who has watched the tournament since he was a senior in high school. “It’s awesome that I finally got a chance to wrestle in this prestigious tournament,” he said.
However, not all wrestlers on the team will compete during the tournament. TJ Franden, a freshman majoring in business administration, wrestled only half the season before he tore his labrum and needed surgery. Even though he won’t be able to compete, he hopes his team will be greatly successful.
“I am extremely proud of my teammates moving on to the tournament and wish them a win,” Franden said. Other teammates not competing won’t be able to travel with the rest of the team but are traveling on their own to support their teammates.
Although it’s the team’s first season in Division I, Horl is confident in his team. “Even though we are the newest team in the conference, there is no reason that we can’t hang with some of the best teams in the EIWA,” he said. The tournament starts at 11 a.m. on Friday, March 6.
