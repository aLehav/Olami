The Tilles Center will host a variety of homecoming concerts from Oct. 12-15. The music groups that will be performing are: Bleachers, Blondie, So You Think You Can Dance Tour, and Alonzo King LINES Ballet.
This year’s lineup will be eclectic to gain a bigger group of attendees, Shari Linker, The Tilles Center’s director of communications and engagement, said. “We figured we would look at it that all age groups will be here from parents down to the students,” Linker said.
The show catering to students will be Bleachers on Oct. 12 at 7:30p.m. Bleachers is a one man group known for their songs “Don’t Take The Money” and “I Wanna Get Better.” Daniel Edwards, the Tilles Center’s Program Manager, feels that the it was a good band to book. “Jack Anteno [vocalist of Bleachers] has been so popular especially for producing with Lorde and now Taylor Swift. I think it’s going to be a really great show,”
Edwards said. The supporting acts for Bleachers will be Secret Weapons and Fox Hollow. All of the performers are from the tri-state area and are indie-rock bands.
Michael Themistocleous, Post alumnus in 2017, is the vocalist for Fox Hollow. Themistocleous explained the process Fox Hollow took to perform with Bleachers at homecoming. “We edited live footage to our song ‘Tennessee Whiskey’ and sent it to Tilles Center and Bleachers,” Themistocleous said.
Themistocleous was informed by the Tilles Center over the summer that Fox Hollow would open for Bleachers. “There are so many emotions: it feels brilliant to say that statement ‘we’re opening for Bleachers.’ Sometimes it’s hard to believe I have the opportunity to say that. I can’t express how lucky I am to play music for people with a group of friends I love tremendously,” Themistocleous said. Fox Hollow recently publicized news about their performance by posting a photo to their Instagram page with artwork by Brian Parisi giving information of the bands opening for Bleachers.
Michael Aquilano, a senior psychology major, is interested in attending the Bleachers concert. “They sound like a modern day The Smiths with more relevant tones, which makes me excited to see them perform live,” he said.
For tickets to see Bleachers and other performances, visit the Tilles Center Box Office or tillescenter.org. Tickets for LIU Post Students with a school ID are $15.

The New York Times has not been available on the news racks on campus this semester. Copies of the newspaper had during previous school years been provided to students, free of charge, for use in their classes.
The New York Times newsstands in the library, Hillwood Commons, Pell Hall, and Humanities are still there, but the newspapers are not. The New York Times had been available to the students from Monday to Friday during the fall and spring semesters.
In the film Ghostbusters, character Egon Spengler famously said, “print is dead.” Yet, professors including Arlene Pelota, professor of public relations, and Barbara Fowles, department chair and professor of communications and film, use the print version of the New York Times in their classes.
“The availability of hard copies of the New York Times is a necessity for many of the classes in our department,” Fowles said. “I am in discussions with Michael Berthel, [dean of students], who is trying to work out an arrangement with the Times. We may not be able to have the paper available campus wide, but our goal is to have sufficient copies available in Humanities for all the students in communications and film who need it. We should have this resolved this week,” Fowles said.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries.
On Sept.13, the bookstore sent out an email with a promotional offer for a New York Times subscription for students. Under this student subscription, students would receive basic digital access to the New York Times website, app and the complete New York Times archive from 1851. The offer will be free for four weeks and will then cost $1 weekly, a $52 annual cost. There is also the basic digital access features package that includes crossword puzzles for four weeks free and then $1.50 weekly. Finally, the offer included the basic digital access features plus a home delivery package that can be customized based on the days students want it delivered to them. This package also includes the Times insider access for “behind-the-scenes stories, photos and videos from journalists in the field and inside the newsroom” and other benefits.
The Student Government Association (SGA) usually takes part in the decision of budget cuts to student services, such as the newspaper delivery on campus. However, SGA President, Giovanna Domingo did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries.

Getting back to school also means getting ready for the real world. The LIU Promise office is helping students do that by hosting a career success workshop series. Finding a job after graduation can be a tricky, which is why LIU Promise has come up with this series to give students a head start.
Kaitlin Montijo, a promise success coach is also the Career Success Coordinator. She is responsible for organizing all of the workshops. Montijo said that this workshop series will benefit students. “The workshops are designed to help students learn tips and tricks to getting hired after graduation, as well as professional skills needed to succeed in the workforce. Resume writing, job searching, and interviewing each require an individual skill set and ample practice in order to be successful,” she said.
The Career Success Workshop Series is run primarily by LIU Promise. However, some academic departments do offer focused workshops for students within their major, according to Montijo. The department of communications & film will be hosting a resume and interview workshop on Oct. 5, separate from the LIU Promise series. Students can reach out to professors within their departments for assistance with obtaining internships and jobs within their fields.
Along with having LIU Promise success coaches hosting all the workshops, they invited industry specific guest presenters to provide different perspectives and insights on certain topics. The interview skills workshop on Nov. 29 will be hosted by a GEICO representative. “Different employer perspectives can give students ideas about what it is like to work in their industries,” Montijo said.
Carly Viverito, a sophomore international business major, learned about the workshop series through her professors. “It is an outlet to find good resources for future employment,” she said. Viverito believes the series will be beneficial for students. “A Lot of students don’t think they have many people to go to with preparing for jobs after graduation,” she said.
The next workshop scheduled for the series will be held on Wednesday, Sept. 27 at the Winnick Mansion from 5:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m.

LIU President emeritus David J. Steinberg chronicles the complex past of one of Long Island’s most important institutions, its first chartered university, in his newly released book, “Preface to the Future: A History of Long Island University through the Turbulent Sixties.”
A revived historian, Steinberg embeds that story in the 20th century evolution of Long Island itself: a fascinatingly diverse place with its mix of urban, suburban and ex-urban, yet, in his words, “struggling in finding itself as something other than a colonial dependency of Manhattan.” Steinberg depicts the tumultuous ‘60s when college campuses were plague spots for student uproar nationwide. “There were two quagmires: the rice paddies of the Mekong delta and the college campuses across America,” Steinberg writes.
President Lyndon Johnson’s tug-of-war with communism in Vietnam led to intergenerational disputes at home. As a result, Steinberg writes, “traditional institutions and mores were jettisoned.” Meanwhile, private sector colleges were close to bankruptcy following the city and state funding of CUNY and SUNY. “Legislators asked why they should funnel federal dollars to institutions that encouraged sexual license, a drug culture, and an open rebellion against the national priority of the Vietnam War?” Steinberg explains.
While most colleges suffered, LIU also found itself in internal strife. The university struggled to unite its three separate campuses in Brooklyn and Long Island’s Nassau and Suffolk counties under one administrative umbrella. “During this decade, students marched and demonstrated; faculty members protested and then militantly unionized; and trustees privately and publically fought with each other,” Steinberg writes, adding that the university frequented the front page of The New York Times— never in a bright light.
The president emeritus deep-dives into this political tussle, and the preeminent characters of the saga. There was William Zeckendorf, a philanthropic spirit in the late ‘40s, who made LIU an institution that flourished. With its Brooklyn swagger, it marched towards national recognition.
Thereupon, a sudden American Airlines crash turned the tide in 1962, as then-university leader—charismatic, four-star Admiral Richard Conolly—was onboard the plane. Over the next decade LIU was led by five chancellors, one of whom was effectively red after just 78 days.
Not to mention the joker in the deck: Gordon Hoxie—the congenial self-promoter, or as Steinberg puts it, “a dreamer who graduated from a state teachers college with limitless ambitions.” Hoxie became a centrality in the so-called “Preface to the Future”—a ten-year development plan published in 1967 with a tone of optimism. It was to be studied cautiously and distinctly followed for the university to get back on the saddle. The reality, however, looked more like riding on a unicorn. “By the time it was printed, it was already dismissed as a gigantic fantasy; an embarrassing monument to his ambition,” Steinberg writes. “Virtually no part of it came to pass. To read it now, decades after publication, is an elegant journey into a lost world.”
The book chronicles key moments building up to the tumultuous decade, and some of its aftermath. It mentions the 1920 founding by a group of Brooklyn civic and business leaders; an Olympic Game invitation to the LIU Blackbirds men’s basketball team in 1939; and the sale of the Suffolk County campus to the State University of New York in 1970.
Steinberg, who served as LIU president for almost 30 years, is upfront with his bias, and thus deliberately cautious in analyzing the overwhelming unkempt records from that time. The text, easily to be made dry with such numeric and old-school lingo, rather turned into eager storytelling—at some points surprisingly witty— and room for readers to interpret the nuances of characters and events for themselves.
As Steinberg writes,, there are some healthy take-homes for the LIU family, but also for those interested in the evolvement of Long Island, or leadership. “Is the tale of LIU a modern day morality play, posing questions such as how do groups within any society or institution resolve conflict, behavior or decision-making?” Steinberg writes. “What is the responsibility of an individual to lead, fail to lead, or simply waffle?”
In truth, LIU has, in the years that followed, learned and managed to restore its ultimate calling: graduating thousands of students. This calling, the author argues, is devoted to “educating men and women drawn from lower middle-class, self-employed, and wage-earning groups. They are first-generation college-goers and often first-generation Americans.” He adds, “LIU, after almost a century, still exists as a private institution devoted to speeding them on their way.”
The paperback is published by CreateSpace, and is available for $24.95 at various booksellers, including the campus bookstore.

The Student Government Association (SGA) advocates for students, enriches their experience and ensures students are satisfied with their time spent at Post. Who are the SGA members doing this work? The new Executive Board, elected last spring have been hard at work.
Giovanna Domingo, President, is a senior accounting major who was introduced in the Pioneer last week. As president, Domingo is responsible for speaking with administrators and staff, delegating tasks to the senators and executive board members and being an advocate for students.
Domingo’s personal goals for SGA this year include continuing to grow the presence of SGA on campus and encouraging underclassmen to get involved. “I joined SGA as a freshman because I wanted to have an influence on the campus and SGA was the best place to do it,” she said. “I credit SGA [with] many of my personal successes on this campus, and will be forever grateful for the opportunities it has given me.”
Olivia Kavanaugh, Vice President, is a junior art education major with an art history minor. Kavanaugh oversees all of the co-sponsorships and relationships with clubs and organizations; she also fills in for the President when needed.
Kavanaugh hopes to increase SGA’s reach on campus and to serve as a positive resource and ally to all student run and governed organizations on campus. “I joined SGA as a freshman because I wanted to get involved as much as I could,” Kavanaugh said. “Since then I wanted to not only be a voice for my graduating class but for the student body as a whole..SGA was the first thing I got involved in here on campus and was the catalyst for all the leadership roles I have taken on.” Kavanaugh also serves as the President of the Panhellenic Council.
Louis Pisano, Treasurer, is a sophomore accounting major. Pisano is responsible to not only to handle finances for the student government, but to receive and respond to budget allocation requests from clubs across campus.
Pisano’s personal goals for this year are to see that clubs on campus succeed and receive the money they need to help grow even more. “I joined SGA after being recommended to and I came to enjoy it,” Pisano said. In addition to SGA, Pisano is also the treasurer of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Stefanie Giovine, the SGA Senate Advisor, is a senior nutrition major. Giovine is responsible for making sure all the senators know their responsibilities and are being active and present on campus.
Giovine aims to get more people involved in all aspects of campus life this semester and to further create a welcoming and fun campus for current and future students. “I joined SGA last fall because I wanted to be able to make a positive impact on this campus and I knew SGA was the place to do that,” Giovine said. Giovine also serves as secretary of Delta Zeta.
Madeline Nunley, SGA Secretary, is a senior digital arts and design major. Her responsibilities include taking minutes during meetings and keeping all Senators informed.
Nunley’s personal goals for this semester are to get more involved around campus and to make a difference in the experience of future students of LIU Post. “I joined SGA my junior year because I felt as though I wanted to be more involved on campus, and also to be a part of something that cared about the student experience,” Nunley said. Nunley is also a layout editor for The Bottom Line magazine.
Adam Silverstein, SGA Parliamentarian, is a sophomore social work major. Silverstein is responsible for making sure everyone is paying attention during the meeting and to make sure that everyone gets a fair chance to speak during debates.
Silverstein wants to grow and develop his own club, Be The Change Club, and to contribute to the enrichment of the LIU Post experience through his work in SGA.
“I joined SGA because I want to help make a positive difference on campus and do what I can to help this university be the best it can be,” Silverstein said. “I am very passionate about taking on leadership roles and I want to continue to develop and improve my skills in that area.” Silverstein is the president of The Be The Change Club.

For college student, sleep is often a luxury. Many of us get up at 6a.m., skip breakfast, run to school, run to work, grab a quick meal on the road, go to practice or to a club, and then hunker down in the library. By that time, we are run down, hungry and exhausted, so what do we do? We grab a cup of coffee for that extra jolt and end up falling asleep way later than we should have, just to start it all again the next day. Sound familiar? If so, you might want to read this.
According to studies done by the National Sleep Foundation, sleep plays a crucial role in the body’s ability to retain old and create new memories. Properly going through the sleep cycles, which include N.R.E.M.,- non- rapid eye movement, and R.E.M.,- rapid eye movement,- for the correct amount of time (seven to nine hours) allows your subconscious mind to ‘study’ not only the memories and facts from that day, but also memories and information stored in long term. It’s a common misconception that the brain and body shut down and relax when we sleep. In fact they’re just as active as when we’re awake, making delta brain waves and stimulating the endocrine system to release vital rejuvenating hormones. Based on studies done by the American Psychological Association, students should think about sleep not as a time to rest, but as a necessary part of our day that’s required for the body to function and maintain proper consciousness.
As reported by NCBI, an online public health journal, proper sleeping patterns also provide physical benefits. Sleeping serves as a block of time when your body engages in self healing. It’s a time where small muscle tears and strains are rebuilt and whole body in ammation from working out or stress is reduced. Studies have connected too little sleep and a failure to enter R.E.M. sleep to decreased metabolism, low muscle mass and an increase cravings for carbohydrates. Since the sleep cycle is guided by many hormones, failure to engage in proper sleep starts a full body cascade of reactions such as food cravings, depression, learning disabilities due to poor memory, higher BMI, and others.
In an interview with Nana Koch, a chairperson and associate professor in the department of Health, Physical Education and Movement Science, she reported that although she’s a night owl, she “gets between five and eight hours of sleep per night and makes sure to get to bed around 11p.m. on days when [she] knows it’s going to be an early morning.”
Considering Nana is in the ‘Adult range’ of needing between seven to eight hours of sleep, and since she has great energy, this is a good amount of time for her to rest for her individual body, especially taking into consideration the fact that when asked, “Do you crave caffeine throughout the day?”, she gave a firm “No.”, supporting the fact that her sleeping pattern is working for her.
Throughout the interview with Nana, I realized that one thing we as college students may overlook is the power of mid day naps. Nana said that if and when she “doesn’t feel completely rested, [she] takes a small nap to diffuse the drowsiness instead of stimulating [her] mind and body with caffeine.” Whether drowsiness hits in class, at home or in the car, ultimately it’s a safer move for both your body and the people around you to give into the exhaustion and rest rather that hype yourself up. I was glad to hear when asking the question “do you ever feel drowsy while driving?”, that Nana too experienced the occasional highway hit that I feel while commuting home from school. Considering she lives over sixty miles away and commutes everyday, pulling over for a twenty minute nap is the smartest solution and supports why Nana reports having “great energy throughout the day” and “[doesn’t] have a hard time recollecting information or simple facts” like so many of us as students do.
If you find yourself having a hard time concentrating, feel irritable, unexplainably sad or not finding the results you’re looking for at the gym despite effort, it might be time to consider your sleep schedule and adjust your life accordingly so that you can get to bed by 11 p.m. This has been shown to be the optimal time to go to bed in order to reach proper N.R.E.M. and R.E.M. cycles.

Chloe Salome Margulis, a spring 2017 graduate with a undergraduate degree in computer science and a minor in information systems, is currently a first year law student at the University of Minnesota Law School.

Q. Where are you from and what did you study at LIU Post?
A. I’m from Port Washington, New York and I majored in computer science with a minor in information systems.
Q. Did you do anything else? Sports? Clubs?
A. I was a sprinter and jumper on the indoor and outdoor track and field team. I engaged in a couple of clubs, like CHATS and I wrote for the [Pioneer] newspaper. I briefly had a column called 10 Questions. Otherwise, I was the tutor for the computer science department and was always getting involved to help my classmates.
Q. You really had a lot on your hands; do you regret any of it? Did you have time for your friends?
A. I don’t regret any of it. I loved becoming active in the community because it definitely helped me grow and mature into who I am today. I believe in a balance between academia, extracurricular activities, and social life. I was able to get that at Post. Yes, it was challenging to fit in time with friends, but I made it a thing whether it was getting lunch after class or running an extra practice for track.
Q. The semester is still new, freshmen are still getting adjusted to college, would you recommend the amount you did to a freshman?
A. No. I suggest to find one thing you are really passionate about and pursue that one thing.
Q. I wouldn’t be able to balance all [you did]. So, what are you up to now? Anything happening in your life?
A. I just started my first year in law school at University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. I also got around to publishing my 8th book. It’s called Curing Eve, and it’s the third in a trilogy dedicated to my grandparents, who were Holocaust survivors.
Q. What are your other books? Do you self-publish them and what are they about?
A. My first book was about the modeling industry, which ironically then became a part of when I was older. I wrote a novella about the industrial revolution and automation. My most recent EVE 1.0 sequences as I mentioned before is another trilogy about my grandparents Holocaust survival stories, which I wrote during my time at LIU. I do all self-publishing. I don’t publish and write with intention of earning profit and becoming famous, I do it because I love to write and want to share my imagination with people. Of course I then have to promote and market myself but it’s better.
Q. Where can we find your book?
A. My books are available on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Nook, Kindle and iBookstore.

As many in our community are aware, President Donald J Trump has made the decision to end the DACA (deferred action for childhood arrivals) program, an immigration policy that ensures that those who have entered the country illegally as children receive protection from deportation and also to be eligible for work permits. Approximately 800,000 individuals, referred to as Dreamers, are protected under this law. Most of them are employees or students pursuing an education that will provide better lives for themselves and their family.
Trump’s repeal of this law, announced on September 5, has caused not only fear but despair in our community. This is tearing families apart and making us question the idea of having the American dream. Many are in fear of deportation and are beginning to lose incentives to pursue their dream. Dreamers in fact are found almost everywhere, not only in our workforce, but also in our educational community.
Meet Gilberto, a 2017 graduate of Hempstead High School, who is now a freshman at Nassau Community College on a full scholarship as a Sillcox Scholar recipient. He is majoring in civil engineering and aspires to obtain a good job to support his parents. In the beginning of his senior year in high school, he was not aware of the college process and was fixated on the idea that he would not be able to further his education because of his citizenship status. From freshmen to senior year, Gilberto had made significant progress in mathematics, yet was not aware of how he could maximize his potential. When he realized he wasn’t eligible to apply for FAFSA because of his immigration status, he lost hope. However, with help from the team center at Hempstead High School, he was able to find a way to seek resources in order to attend college and further his education.
During the process, Gilberto mentioned his journey from Mexico into the United States to another DACA recipient, who has now obtained her bachelor’s degree in social work and is counseling students like Gilberto at Hempstead High School. Gilberto shared that as a boy, he was detained from police troopers while crossing the border to meet his mother. This was a devastating moment for his parents because they knew that their son wasn’t a criminal. Today, as Gilberto reflects on his journey, he is thankful he went through it to get to where he is. Because he did not have a work permit, he looked into volunteer opportunities in high school. He ended up volunteering at the Hempstead Public Library, and was able to finish his school work there as well as excel in his classes. Now a college student, Gilberto is thrilled with the opportunity to attend college. However, he wishes he was aware of other options, including DACA, which could have provided him with a work permit. He does not regret where he is now, however. He is thankful for the fear that pushed him to further his education. 
Let’s also meet Anthony, another graduate from Hempstead High School, in the class of 2016. Anthony is also part of the DACA program and a Sillcox Scholar recipient. He is a pre-med student studying at Hunter College who aspires to become a medical doctor in the future. Anthony was born in El Salvador and crossed the U.S-Mexico border. This is one of the hurdles he faced at a young age. He only discovered he was undocumented during his sophomore year of high school. At first, he saw only how this would limit the options he would have in the college admissions process. But, he used this as a stepping stone to break boundaries and took the risk of seeking a school that would allow him to pursue a degree in the sciences for the next 4-5 years. With a passion to study the sciences and to restore the health of others, Anthony continues to influence other students to follow their dreams and to never stop learning. He influences students from different socioeconomic backgrounds and is passionate about helping those wanting to enter the medical field. He is grateful for the resources Hempstead High School equipped him with in order to be enrolled in Hunter College.
Anthony discovered DACA has been repealed while studying organic chemistry with a fellow classmate. “At first, I didn’t really know what to feel because it seemed unreal… as if I had wished upon one of my nightmares to become reality,” he said.
Anthony felt for the other medical students who were also DACA recipients, who would be greatly affected by this repeal. “As a pre-med student, I know the huge stress, challenge, and demand this field entails… and to just have all their hard work be placed in vein really tormented me,” he said.
Although devastated, Anthony does not let this stop him. He says he has faith for the future and when the opportunity arises, he will make his dream come true and make sure others will as well. He says he is now more motivated in his scholastic pursuits. Anthony has a message for fellow Dreamers. “Don’t allow this to constrain you guys. We’ve already succeeded in so many aspects of life. We’ve defied the norms placed on us by society and shall continue to do so through our success. We are titled DREAMERS for a reason, we hold potential to aspire for greatness… and let’s continue to do so,” he said.
What about the social worker who took Gilberto under her wing, who is also a DACA recipient? Well, meet Jasmine. Jasmine is now a graduate student at Stony Brook University, obtaining her master’s degree in social work. Jasmine has overcome the hurdle that English is not her first language, but she did not let this stop her. After receiving her undergraduate degree, she became driven to help other students achieve their dreams the same way she has been able to attain hers. She has decided to give back to her community by becoming an intern in the same place she graduated from, Hempstead High School. As a graduate of the class of 2012, Jasmine says that 2012, the year she graduated from Hempstead High School, was a blissful year for her as it was the year that the DACA program began. The program enabled her to attend Nassau Community College as a Sillcox Scholar and DACA recipient.
“I did not care about the amount of money I would have to spend for college,” Jasmine said. “This became a major positive change in my life and I’m very thankful… I never thought this dream would become a reality.”
Jasmine made remarkable contributions back to her community by counseling students in the teamcenter and developing groups for Dreamers like herself. She wanted Dreamers to know that they weren’t alone in the process of applying to college and in life. When Jasmine discovered Trump’s repeal of DACA, she also became devastated. She witnessed news about fellow Dreamers getting arrested while protesting the streets on New York City. “My heart just shattered into pieces; it felt like my soul just came out from the inside… I never expected that this repeal would ever come… Obama created this law to protect the dreamers, not to put us in fear,” Jasmine said.
Jasmine now questions what will happen after she obtains her master’s degree. This has not stopped her, though. Instead, it has given her a stronger motive to continue this good fight. She wants all Dreamers to know that they are all here to stay. Jasmine has also summoned the courage to share with her classmates at Stony Brook University that she is a DACA recipient.
“I think it is unfair to us Dreamers; we have proven enough that we are willing to work… I am willing to give back to students of all races and ethnicities… it just isn’t fair… this has been a major hit for us Dreamers,” Jasmine said.
Let’s face it, we’re all Dreamers in our educational community. Regardless of our socioeconomic backgrounds, we each are trying to pursue our dream. Although I am a citizen, I am proud to say that I am an advocate for Dreamers today because my parents faced hurdles at a young age as well. As time waits for no one, we should all continue to acknowledge our differences and have a better perspective of the shoes that we all have to walk in. Our Dreamers today and in the future will make more contributions to our community, whether they are citizens or not. We are all Dreamers.

Feeling lost and not knowing which direction you feel your life in going in is more common among students than you might think. We are sent here to determine what our futures will be like once we graduate. This can cause a huge panic within ourselves because the pressure to figure how we want to spend the rest of our lives ultimately starts now.
What do you want to major in? What jobs will pay you well so you can live comfortably? What fields of work are hiring? Do you want a job that you are passionate about? Or do you want a job that is well-respected job?
These are just a few questions that run through our minds. We can’t seem to stop them. Classes alone can be stressful and overwhelming without thinking about our futures. But maybe, if we step back and take a good look for what you are passionate about you can figure out how to take the pressure off.
The best advice is to try as many classes as you think you might be interested in. It doesn’t hurt to take time find a class you love. Disregard what people might say the best path is for you to follow is. You are the one who determines your own path; don’t change your interest just because people have different opinions about what you should do.
Here are a few examples of how your major now doesn’t always determine your future. Comedian Steve Martin attended California State University, Long Beach as a Philosophy major and ended up a world famous comic. Actor Julie Bowen went to Brown University and majored in Renaissance studies, although her passion for acting was what she followed. Famous author J.K. Rowling known for her famous series Harry Potter, once went to school and majored in French along with being in a horrible mental state she fought and followed her passion for writing.
Find something you are passionate about, something that you love doing and find a way to make that into a career. Doing something that you love will make your college experience so much more enjoyable rather than spending your time here miserable because you chose to take the path that others wanted you to. Your time in college is apart of your journey through life and it is a huge part of what direction you will follow in the future, but it is not an issue to stress over as long as you follow your passions and stay motivated.

The Steinberg Museum of Art moved out of its prior home on the second floor of Hillwood Commons in September 2016, and was replaced by the campus bookstore. Although a move of the museum to the lower level of the library was announced, the museum remained closed during the 2016-2017 school year. Plans to reopen the museum this semester are now underway.
Barbara Applegate, director of the Steinberg Museum, hopes the museum will be ready for a soft opening in November for the gallery space itself, and that the entire museum will be fully operating by mid-December. The museum will hold different exhibitions throughout the year.
Steven Breese, the new dean of the College of Arts, Communications, and Design, is looking forward to the museum’s reopening, “Original works of art are ‘primary texts’ and ‘reading them’ offers us new ways to think about and to view the world,” Breese said. “Museums are built for learning, but not through hard, laborious work. Instead, Art & Museums engage in a special kind of pedagogical magic — through luxurious, critical observation,” he said.
Construction for the museum began at the end of June, after months of meetings, analysis of blueprints, and creation of a design layout. Applegate hopes the initial construction will be completed by Sept. 25. Custom furniture and custom glass will be placed inside, after the renovation is complete.
In addition to the museum itself, the university will be moving about 4,000 pieces of artwork, including African sculpture and various types of pottery, from the storage room in Hillwood Commons to a visible storage area in the lower level book stacks, attached via a shared entranceway inside the museum. Moving such fragile artwork will take a five person crew 30 days.
Applegate, has spent much of her time over the past year designing the look for the museum based on other museums she has visited. Her plan for the museum is for it to be an uninterrupted space, with nothing distracting the eye from the artwork.
Renovations to the museum include removing the marble walls and replacing them with pure white paint, special museum lighting in the ceiling, proper heating and ventilation to ensure the proper climate for the artwork, and the installation in the portico of chandeliers purchased by Mary Lai, at the World’s Fair in 1965. Also, for the first time since the 1960’s, the front of the library, (facing Northern Boulevard) will be open as an entrance. For many years, the library’s front entrance has been closed.
The first planned exhibition at the museum, “Abstract Expressionism Behind the Iron Curtain,” will be in November. “The exhibit will examine artwork in a communist world. “These works are made in an oppressive state, but it speaks to that notion that artists are compelled to make regardless of what the state says,” Applegate said. “For many of these men, this is the first time their artwork has been shown in the United States; some of their work has already been shown at the Museum of Modern Art,” she added.
Applegate plans each exhibition years in advance. She likes students who are on campus “to see different things across those four years,” Applegate said.

The process of creating special effects starts from storyboards; the scenes are sketched and captioned before actors bring them to life. Sohn explained that he doesn’t teach anything crazy, like how to create a giant explosion in a film, but rather that the effects “should come from your idea and your vision.” Any kind of effect should have to do with storytelling, and be done with reason, according to Sohn.
Sohn teaches special effects to his students while on set to engage them through a “classroom change.” When it comes to special effects created on the computer, he added, “you have to have [a] love of it.”
Sohn has learned from generations of filmmakers, including a few from South Korea. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts at Chung Ang University, Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, and his Master of Fine Arts at the American Film Institute at New York University.
Sohn has held different jobs on the sets of four films. One of his first full length feature lms was “Make Yourself at Home,” which he wrote and directed. For said film, he was invited to attend the 2008 Pusan International Film Festival Gala Presentation, Oldenburg Film Festival, San Diego Asian Film Festival, and the Athens Film Festival.
Sohn’s favorite position in filmmaking depends on a couple of factors, such as the weather, time of day, and quality of actors. “If I have a good time with actors, I enjoy directing. But if I have a bad time with actors, I would prefer cinematography,” he said. Working with actors is unpredictable and cinematography is more predictable, like science and art, according to Sohn. “Directing actors can be really exciting too. Every day changes,” he said.

The Emerging Student Theatre Artists (ESTA) is a campus group for students with a passion for theater, improv, and all aspects of the stage. Members of ESTA have recently announced the performance lineup for their 2017 season.
ESTA is student run, directed and produced. They hold events and put on several productions throughout the year. The donated proceeds of these shows go to Broadway Cares: Equity Fights Aids. They also sell stickers and other merchandise, and accept venmo donations as well.
Isabelle Rutens, vice president of the group, says her experience with ESTA led to finding her passion for improvisation. She recalls joining No Control, the improvisation group of ESTA, as one of the first members. Rutens discovered her desire to pursue improvisation and comedy as a career through the work she has done with ESTA. “The program is a really great way for students to unwind and have fun on stage. It’s also a great way for students to have their own original work actually produced and put on stage for an audience,” Rutens said.
ESTA will start their season this year with a performance called “Never Have We Ever: A Cabaret” followed by “A Musical Improvalooza” taking place on Sept. 30 at 7 p.m. It will feature some members singing pieces of their choice, and others performing a music extravaganza. This event is followed by No Control’s “Halloween Spooktacular” at 11 p.m. Oct. 28. The group is also performing a play written by sophomore musical theatre major, Thea Kraus, titled “Complicated” on Oct. 29 at 6 p.m., about the highs and lows of a lesbian relationship.
Later in the semester, the group will produce “Calvin Berger,” a musical about the struggles of high school, directed by Kayla Bernie, a sophomore arts management major. All productions will take place at the Rifle Range Theatre.
ESTA is still accepting proposals for next semester’s season, and is open to all majors. If interested, submit a proposal 1 1⁄2 to three pages long, including concept, budget, and how it appeals to the club to esta.liupost@gmail.com.

Both on and off the field, the members of the field hockey team are constantly striving to be their best. By supporting the national nonprofit organization ‘Go4theGoal’, the team is raising funds and awareness for pediatric cancer, while also balancing being undefeated and ranked 4th in the country by NCAA in Division II.
‘Go4theGoal’ launched an initiative, Lace Up 4 Pediatric Cancer, in 2011 in which athletes of all sports and levels across the country wear gold laces to support the fight against pediatric cancer. Each member of the field hockey team, led by head coach Raenee Savin, donated and received a pair of gold laces that they wear every day in their turf shoes.
Savin has created an online funding page for her team, and also opened it up to their friends and other athletes to donate, expanding the awareness among the athletes at Post as well as Division II field hockey. “I wish that there wasn’t a need to raise funds and awareness, but because there is, I’m glad LIU POST Field Hockey can be a part of it!” Savin said. “Not only is our team taking part in this cause, but we’ve encouraged others to join us and many other D-II field hockey teams have jumped on board as well.” Others can help by either donating to the field hockey funding page or giving $5 to ‘Go4theGoal’ to receive a pair of gold laces that represent the color of pediatric cancer awareness.
On Sunday, Sept. 17, the team held a pediatric cancer awareness game against St Michaels University. The fellow NE10 team also donated and made an impact, with their team also lacing up. The entire field hockey team at East Stroudsburg University, another Division II rival, has also donated to the cause, as well as members of the LIU Post lacrosse team and the equestrian team.
The impact of spreading the word, not only at LIU Post, but also at other Division II schools is rewarding to members of the team. “It’s wonderful to see opposing teams coming together, all wearing gold laces to support a great cause,”Kaycee Zelkovsky, a senior leader on the team, said.
Students interested in donating to a good cause can go to liupostpioneers.com and contact Coach Raenee Savin. The funds provide immediate support to children and their families in our local area. By working together, the LIU Post community can Lace Up 4 Cancer, wear gold, and fight.

On Sunday, Sept. 24, the New York Jets won their home opener against the Miami Dolphins with an outstanding victory of 20-6. The game was surely a fun one to watch, as the game was sold out to a loud and boisterous crowd. Met Life Stadium is loud and is filled to the brim with people.
From pretzels to beer to pizza, the food vendors lining the interior of the stadium have it all. Experiencing a professional football game in person is truly spectacular.
[Editors Note: The tickets for the home opener were generously provided to the Pioneer by Moreen Mitchell.]

LIU Post Pioneers Quarterback Yianni Gavalas has been on an absolute tear at the start the 2017 season. His deep completions and passes have guided the Pioneers to a 3-0 record, helping them outscore their opponents by 21.6 points per game.
In his most recent performance, Gavalas threw for an impressive 406 yards and four touchdowns, leading the Pioneers over Stonehill College 51-16. His 35 pass completions out of 43 tries (81.4 completion percentage) was his highest of the season and this performance earned him back-to- back Northeast-10 Conference Offensive Player of the Week honors, as the conference office released on Monday.
When asked the reason for his overwhelming success, Gavalas responded humbly, giving credit to his teammates and coaches, but especially the guys who protect him on each play, the offensive line.
“[It] stems from the play of my teammates and the coaching staff ; they make my job a lot easier when they put me in the right position and play well,” Gavalas said. “The offensive line has been great, protecting me and allowing me to have time in the pocket, as well as the defense.” Gavalas, a Graduate student, has thrown for four touchdowns in each of the first three games of the season, good for first place in the Northeast 10 conference. With two of the three games being conference battles, his conference numbers rank him first in touchdowns (8), yards (811), yards per game (405.5), completions (76), attempts (97), completion percentage (78.4%), and pass efficiency (173.7). Numbers being said, it is obvious he completely earned his back- to-back Northeast-10 Conference Offensive Player of the Week honors.
Standing 6’2”, weighing 220 lbs and being an already experienced player, Gavalas has the athletic ability of a marquee Quarterback. Increased focus on his footwork this past off season, has allowed him to improve his skills—the more swiftly he could move in the pocket, the more accurate his throws will be.
Yianni Gavalas has much more to prove in his first season as the LIU Post Pioneers Quarterback. Catch the team and Gavalas back on the field, on Saturday, September 23 when they travel to Waltham, Massachusetts to take on Bentley University at 2 p.m.
