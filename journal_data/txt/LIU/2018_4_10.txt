The powerful history of Native Americans that has often been overlooked in studies of America’s past comes to light in the film “IndianHorse.” The movie is an adaptation of a novel by Richard Wagamese of the same name. It depictsthe struggles of the country’s indigenous peoplein the 60s and 70s as they were forced to conform to a culture not their own. In partnership with the CANA Foundation, a global rewilding organization, the LIU Global Institute will present an exclusive screening of the film on April 16 at 6 p.m.in the Gold Coast Cinema. Thanks to Steve Israel, chairman of the Global Institute, the student bodywill have the opportunity to view the film.
Will Strongheart, who plays Virgil Kelly, hockey team captain, in the film, will be present at the screening, along with producer Paula Devonshire, for a Q&A session with the audience. “We want to engage [in] some dialogue so we can talk about reconciliation,” Strongheart said.“ A lot of people are unaware that the status of our native people has a lot to do with the traumatic stresses that were suffered through [residential] schools.”
The story follows a young Native American boy named Saul Indian Horse as he is confronted with racism when forcibly enrolled in a residential school in Canada. Residential schools were common in both Canada and the U.S. in the late 19th and mid 20th centuries. “For indigenous children, it was mandatory that they were subject to this school and basically stripped of their culture to blend in to the new Western culture,” Strongheart said. One scene in the film depicts young Indian Horse (Sladen Peltier) having his long hair cut
by Catholic nuns, signifying a great loss of part of himself.
As a child, Indian Horse is robbed of his culture, family and language and finds sanctuaryin playing on an all-Native American hockey team. “He’s isolated from everything that he is, so he uses that as an opportunity to heal and cope with what’s going on,” Strongheart said. Indian Horse gradually improved and rose in the ranks of the hockey team, the Moose. “All along, he’s battling the demons that he’s inherited through the traumatic stress that he’s suffered through the school,” Strongheart said.
Strongheart’s character, Virgil Kelly, becomes an adoptive older brother to Indian Horse after Kelly’s father removes him from the residential school. They work to hone the younger boy’s hockey skills so that he can eventually advance to play hockey in a league beyond the school.
The film sheds light on truths that would otherwise go unrevealed, according to Strongheart. “We’re hoping to build the bridge between truth and reconciliation,”he said. Strongheart hopes the film will mend relationships between indigenous people and the Canadian government that implemented residential schools.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commision of Canada, founded in 2008, seeks to educate the Canadian population about what happened to indigenous people within residential schools. “The ball is moving forward; globally, people are accepting of [our history],” Strongheart said.
Strongheart is glad to be screening the film at Post because of the diversity of the student body. The film’s popularity in Canada stems from the country’s abundance of native inhabitants. “Where we live, the narrative of native people isn’t as high, so you get a multitude of students there with openness and willingness to listen to these stories,” Strongheart said, “The hope is to spread the message, and I know that LIU Post is a great platform to do that.”
Since his parents attended a residential school (the last one closed in 1996), Strongheart has a strong personal connection to the film. “It’s been around all my life; I’ve seen the results,” he said. Strongheart grew up in Kansas but spent a majority of his life in Canada. 
Alcoholism and other problems permeate the Native American community, according to Strongheart, caused by the depression the population faced in previous decades. “That trauma was passed down like a torch, and I inherited that from my own parents,” he said,“I heard the stories first hand from their mouths and it was very, very dark.”
The other actors have a similar connection to the story, according to Strongheart. “We’ve all lived it, it isn’t just a role; we’ve all come from the ashes of those schools,” he said. The process was deeper than what the audiences see on screen. Over the nine-month long filming of the project, the creative team was respectful of the cast and their rituals, including smudging, a method of purification using the smoke of sage. Filming scenes with racial tension were especially heavy for the actors. “Those are real tears,” Strongheart said about the emotion portrayed in the film. “Whether we were being spit on or being made fun of because we were Native, we had to walk off set and smudge off that negativity,” he said. He compared the process of revisiting painful memories to opening up an old wound, but overall it was healing because of the supportive family environment they worked within.
“This isn’t fiction; you’re getting into the heart and soul of people and what was taken from us,” he said. Much of the cast is first-time actors.
“Indian Horse” was shown worldwide at film festivals across Canada, the U.S, and France. The movie has won awards including audience choice for best picture at the 2017 Vancouver International Film Festival. Sladen Peltier received the award for best supporting actor at the 6th Canadian Screen Awards for his portrayal of young Saul Indian Horse.
“These are stories you don’t see in your history books, but they are part of this history,” Strongheart said.

Seniors, it’s about that time. That time you’ve been looking forward to since your freshman year. That time you thought would take forever to come. That time you are actually dreading now that it’s here. Graduation. And you know what that means; it means the real world. It means moving out of your parents’ house, paying for your own house, your own food, and your own bills. To be able to pay for these things, you’ll need one thing: a job.
The office of Employer and Alumni Engagement is hosting a graduating students job fair to help you get just that. Companies will be in the Employer Engagement office from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. on April 24 to meet with seniors and recent alumni looking for entry level and part time jobs and internships. Business casual attire is required, and students should bring several copies of their resumes.
The employer and alumni engagement office’s mission for this fair is to get students jobs. “I remember my senior year, graduation was coming I was like ‘this is awesome.’ Then I realized I didn’t have a job, and had no idea what I was going do, I had no plan so I had to make a plan quick,” Joan Yonke, campus director of employer and alumni engagement, said.
Yonke believes this is a great opportunity for students who don’t have anything lined up for after graduation. The companies will be offering entry-level jobs in management trainee programs where students will get experience and hands-on learning.
Tiffany Reyes, a senior criminal justice major, plans to attend the fair. “As graduation approaches all seniors should be encouraged to go because it gives them options and opportunities of what they would want to do after graduation instead of feeling stuck,” Reyes said.
This is the second year that the employer and alumni engagement office will be hosting this fair. Last year 60 employers attended and 15 will be present this year, according to Michelle Nimetz, the assistant director of employer and alumni engagement. Among the companies attending are Penske, Geico and Cintas. Even though there are fewer employersthis year, Yonke and Nimetz are hopeful that many students will come.
“We love putting on these events,” Nimetz said. Students come here for four years and the end goal is to get a job. So us being able to make that connection from employers to students and watch them get hired and start their lives is very nice,” Nimetz said.
The office of employer and alumni engagement is located at the old bookstore building across from Winnick Mansion. Students interested can contact Joan.Yonke@liu.edu or call 516-299-2263.

Dr. John Lutz, English department chairperson and professor, announced his resignation as chair and member of the Faculty Council on Thursday, April 5. Lutz has held this position since January 2017, when the former chair, Michele Dornisch, resigned. Lutz’s resignation is effective the end of April.
Lutz shared his reasons for leaving in an email to members of the Faculty Council. “I feel that I can no longer participate in the process of shared governance because I no longer believe that we have any real shared governance,” he wrote. “Although there may be well-meaning administrators, in my view, their effectiveness and ability to participate in shared governance is thoroughly and fatally compromised by the tyrannical leadership of our President.” Lutz has been a member of the Council for three years, serving as secretary, vice chair and now chair.
The role of the Faculty Council is to collaborate with the administration to advance student learning and the creation of knowledge through faculty research.
Jon Schneider, the university’s director of public relations, responded on behalf of University President Kimberly Cline. “The process of updating LIU’s core curriculum, as well as our strategic planning process, are both strong examples of shared governance at our University. We have also seen improved communication through the developmentof the Campus Leadership Committee, regular communications to the campus community, meetings with the Faculty Council, and the addition of Deans to senior leadership meetings.”
Schneider said Cline’s goal, like the goal of the Faculty Council, is to support students. “With programs like LIU Promise, our university is committed to supporting student success. I am pleased to say that graduation rates have dramatically improved over the past several years as a result of our collective efforts. Now that we have adopted best academic practices by moving to a 120-credit requirement, improving our core, and standardizing credit overload policies to match those already in place at peer universities, this will further contribute to student success by improving graduation rates.”
Lutz disagrees. “Decisions are being made without faculty. Shared governance is a farce,” he said.
A pivotal moment in this rift, according to Lutz, arose in Sept. 2016, when the LIU Brooklyn faculty was locked out before the start of classes after their union contracts expired. The Pioneer reported in a Sept. 14, 2016 article, “LIU Faculty Disruption to Begin Semester” that the Brooklyn faculty were denied access to the campus, had their emails blocked, and had their health insurance cancelled. The lockout, Lutz said, had a negative impact at Post as well.
The faculty had no confidence in Cline after the lockout. Lutz was listed as a contact for the faculty, although the faculty’s position was not his personal statement. Since then, Cline accused Lutz of libel four times. “I’ve taken that as an attempt to intimidate and silence me and the faculty – preventing us from exercising our constitutional rights,” Lutz said.
LIU’s Board of Trustees hired Cline as president in July 2013, and in November 2017 granted her a contract extension until 2023, despite the votes of no confidence by faculty at both the Brooklyn and Post campuses.
“I look back on the things we sent, the issues we have raised and I can’t point to a single thing that they [the administration] compromised on,” Lutz said, explaining what he called a lack of shared governance.The only instance of collaboration was the creation of the 120 core credit policy, which Lutz said had “nothing to do with the administration and everything to do with others being able to collaborate with me.”
Lutz said the faculty had “absolutely no involvement” in the new 18 credit policy, and many learned from their students.
“After three years, you would think there would be some give and take – that they would value the faculty’s perception of what is good. That doesn’t mean that there must always be an agreement – but don’t disagree on everything,” he said. “It’s Cline’s way or the highway.”
Lutz isn’t the only faculty member speaking out against the administration, according to Katherine Hill-Miller, English professor and former dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. “The narrative presented [by the administration] to the Board of Trustees is that the faculty are gripping and tearing the institution apart,” she said, but that is not the case. “All of us faculty members love our students. We have a great passion for the institution – we are very protective of it,” she said.
Hill-Miller is sorry to see Lutz leave the Faculty Council position. “He is such a voice of rationality and collaboration,” she said.
“I think the faculty owes [Lutz] a debt of gratitude. He did a very important service trying to deal with the administration for two years, which wasn’t easy,” Michael Soupios, political science professor, said.
Soupios thinks university administrators are rapidly reaching a point where they think they can do “more or less anything they want.”
“Dr. Cline’s mismanagement of human resources has paralyzed daily operations and reduced morale to an all-time low. I’ve worked unsuccessfully toward shared governance for three years. I’m a graduate of LIU Post. The direction of my life was fundamentally changed by the dedication and intellectual vision of faculty here. I’m not speaking out publicly to harm the university, but out of love for it: love for Post, love for my colleagues, love for learning, but, most of all, love for my students. President Cline’s greatest failure of leadership has been her inability to nurture these forms of love in faculty. Instead, she has persuaded most of us that her goals are inimical to our most cherished beliefs and values,” Lutz said.
Mark Pires, Faculty Council vice chairperson, is also saddened by Lutz’s decision, but believes it is understandable given the many challenges currently facing the university. “Dr. Lutz has served the LIU Post Faculty Council and the students of this campus with distinction and integrity for many years. He is a respected colleague and a tireless advocate for high quality academic programming,” Pires said.
“We faculty have dedicated our careers to the university, while administration has cycled through a rotating cast of characters. We have a vested interest in seeing the university thrive, and hoped our ideas and concerns could be heard as the university moves forward. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly apparent that the administration is not interested in hearing from faculty,” Heather Parrott, a sociology professor, said.
Several members on the Faculty Council will finish their terms at the end of this year and there have been two calls for nominations, yet Lutz said that no one has volunteered. “I have never seen faculty so demoralized – never seen so many people disengaged. People think their voice doesn’t matter. They don’t see – as I don’t see – an [administrative] effort to make change,” he said.
Lutz believes there are many good administrators, all of whom he admires and has good relationships with, but they are in a difficult position. “The perception of faculty is that those professionals [the administration] are over burdened,” Lutz said.
“I don’t resign without a real sense of sadness,” he said. The level of stress and lack of peace of mind, worrying about LIU and the frustration of not being able to move forward, has impacted Lutz personally. “I’ve done my service, now I will focus on my family and my scholarship,” he said. Lutz will continue teaching and remain chair of the English department.
Lutz referenced the play “Death of a Salesman” by Arthur Miller, comparing himself to the protagonist Willy Loman. “Willy is so attached to his dreams and his vision that he destroys himself and his family – his dream was not consistent with reality. I, like Willy, spent three years within the faculty council with a dream, with false hope.” Like Biff, Willy’s son, said in the play, “Sometimes a man has to walk away.”

Faculty from the School of Health Professions and Nursing hosted their second annual “Interprofessional Education Learning Collaborative” on Tuesday, April 3 during common hour. The event, held in the Pratt Recreation Center, was meant to create connections between health science students from different majors. Over 600 people attended the event, which consisted of speeches and a case study that students could collaborate on and discuss.
“Team-based education will help the students succeed in their jobs,” Linda Vila, assistant professor of health care and public administration, said. “Students from all different health professions are here today learning about interprofessional education.” In her speech at the event, Vila discussed the importance of ethical decision making to the health profession. She outlined the “big four ethics principles” that healthcare workers must use every day. These four principles are autonomy, beneficence, non-malevolence and justice, which equate to “doing no harm” to patients, according to Vila.
Vila discussed empathy, which she said is “putting yourself in the position of another.” To Vila, empathy is “the mark of a top-notch professional” in the healthcare field.
Kayla Halper, a freshman nursing major, found the event helpful. “This is a collaboration of all different health science majors,” Halper said. “We can see how our different roles will interact in a real-life situation.”
Casey Mannix, a senior social work major, also discussed the benefits of the event. “I interned at a nursing home, so it’s important to understand the different aspects of who you might be working with in the future,” Mannix said. “I want to work in a hospital setting, so I’ll be working with people from all different disciplines.”
The event included a case study, which discussed ethical principles and hands-on collaboration between students.
Brianna LoBianco, a junior biomedical science major, said the event was engaging. “Students were grouped together, varying in different health profession majors. It was nice to see how well we were able to discuss our own thoughts on the case and come together to think of a proper plan for the patients,” LoBianco said. “I enjoyed the case study itself because it is applicable to what I will be doing in the real world someday.”
Dr. Lori Knapp, Post vice president of academic affairs and a former professor of nursing and acting dean of the School of Health Professions and Nursing, said that the health profession has become a collaborative field. “We know that mutual respect and understanding make a difference in how we practice,” Knapp said.
“[In healthcare] you can’t just talk about what you know, you need to talk about things like values and ethics,” Knapp said. “Up until 25 years ago, if you picked a profession, you want out and did your job and that was good enough. We’ve learned now that we do a better job when we work together.”

Former Congressman Steve Israel, a resident of Oyster Bay, became chairman of the newly created LIU Global Institute on Jan. 4, 2017. He recently spoke with “The Pioneer” to reflect on the Global Institute’s first year.
When Israel was in Congress, he represented the second and third Congressional District of New York, an area LIU is included in. He called Long Island University,  a “jewel in the crown” of his district, so when LIU President Kimberly Cline called him after he announced his retirement from Congress and asked if he would be interested in creating an initiative at LIU, he was intrigued. While the university assisted in the initial funding to for the Global Institute, a part of Israel’s responsibility is fundraising to maintain the budget, pay speakers and keep the institute operating.
Israel wants to engage students interested in law, public policy and an array of other fields. “Any program we do, we start with the students, we have breakfast sessions with diplomats that students are invited to, we provide tickets to events at discounted rates for them, sometimes at no cost at all,” he said.
This spring the Global Institute Student Fellowship Opportunity was created for LIU students. It seeks “civic minded” students with an interest in politics, community engagement and global affairs. Students in the fellowship program participate in assisting the planning, set up, and execution of events, promote Global Institute events to the student body, make phone calls to members of the community on behalf of the institute, and work with staff to update and maintain paperwork. There are five LIU students in the fellowship, a majority of them majoring in political science.
Thomas Pallini, a junior political science major, is part of the Global Institute Fellowship. “Through working with Congressman Israel as a fellow of the Global Institute, I’ve been privileged enough to help coordinate the student-oriented events of the institute and help provide my peers a deeper understanding of the seemingly complicated world we live in today. I’ve been fortunate enough to meet our country’s current and former leaders, which, for my political science major, has been an incredible experience. This fellowship has provided me with a foundation in politics, and has allowed to me realize what my true passion is. Working directly with the Congressman, I’ve seen how much dedication and passion he puts into the institute, skills that I have now developed, and how much he cares about the students of the university. It’s been an honor and a pleasure working with him to help elevate LIU to a top-tier university that I’ll be proud to graduate from,” Pallini said.
Israel is also teaching an honors advanced elective course in the political science department on Politics, Media, & Culture this semester, his first course at LIU.
Madeline Nunley, a senior digital art and design major, is in the honors course this semester. “It has been an enriching experience to have Steve Israel as my professor. Getting to learn about Congress and politics from someone who has dedicated their life to it is something special,” she said. “I have learned a lot and feel like I have gotten the inside scoop on what it is really like to be a member of Congress and just how things works. It seems vastly complicated, but he is able to cut through the complicated things and really delve into what it means to work in politics,” she added.
Israel has connections with many political leaders, both Republicans and Democrats. He invited a few to speak on campus during the past year. “When I was in Congress, I really tried to focus on building relationships with people on either side,” he said. “If we can get people from the Democratic and Republican side to meet as Americans and for their best interest, you can make progress.”
In deciding who to invite to campus, he explained that he chooses “individuals who are thought leaders and not particularly partisan. In addition, people who will add value to this university, who are willing to speak to students and teach them new things that will be useful.”
Israel loves his new role at LIU. Being here allows him to “be an explorer and really sit down with political leaders to have meaningful conversations with them that last longer than the one minute maximum he was given while in Congress,” Israel said. “You can’t really understand what’s happening with ISIS, the economy, and North Korea based on a one minute speech; this gives me an opportunity to really understand it and share that experience with students and faculty,” he said.
Israel held events in the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, where guest speakers General Colin Powell, Congressman Adam Schiff, former CIA Director General David H. Petraeus, former President Bill Clinton and more recently former Vice President Joe Biden gave a speech followed by a public talk with Israel. For the Fall of 2018, Israel plans to bring former President George W. Bush to LIU.

The freshmen of the Post Theatre Company (PTC) will take the stage for their debut performances from April 12 to 15. With 55 theater and musical theatre majors, the largest freshman class to date, the showcase has been divided into two shows, “When We Arrive,” directed by David Apichell, adjunct professor of theatre arts, and “Hide and Seek,” directed by Lauren Reinhard, professor in the department of theatre and LIU Post alumna. Each of the pieces is an anthology of eight short plays, ensuring stage time for every actor. Although the cast is composed of first-years, upperclassmen fill the productions’ technical positions.
The audition process took place at the beginning of December and roles were cast after the winter recess. The students had to prepare a one-minute monologue that best highlights their talents. Reinhard and Apichell, along withtheir assistant directors, then cast the plays. The cast rehearsed for just over three weeks.
This is Reinhard’s seventh year directingthe freshman showcase. Performing several short plays this year helped to “make [the show] a bit juicer” and “gave people more to work on,”Reinhard said. Her concept behind “Hide and Seek” is both literal and gurative. “[It’s] what we hide and what we are looking for,” she said. Having done this for several years, finding eight new 10-minute plays can be difficult, “Some are throwbacks to plays I’ve done many years ago,” Reinhard said. Investing in a couple new “10-minute play books” also aided her search. Reinhard is incorporating skills the first years are developing in classes with the closing of the show being entirely movement-based.
The closing is close to the hearts of Reinhard and her cast. The students opened up to the director about the things they are hiding and searching for. “It’s always beautiful and humbling how personal they get,” Reinhard said. She took the words of the students and constructed a physical expression with the help of junior musical theatre majors Tiffany Alderson and Griffin Lockette.
First-time assistant director and junior acting major Aaron Cooper, raved about the experience working with Reinhard and the first years. “It’s like looking in the mirror in a way,” Cooper said, as he reflected on the two years that have passed since his freshmen showcase. “I’m really excited to see them when they are in my position,” he said. “They are only starting off their journey here, and they are really great at it.” Hermly believes from watching his cast mature, and from his own experiences, that the most growth results from the freshmen showcase.
Freshman acting major Julia Rivera, who is starring in “Hippy Van Gumdrop,” is prepared for her debut on the Little Theatre stage. “Working with Reinhard is amazing,” she said, “I amso honored to be here.”
Freshman musical theatre major Jack Mannion is starring in “Slop Culture.” “Every minute counts,” he said about the short 10-minute plays. He commended the group that has been created among his peers. “I feel I have a sense of community,” Mannion said, “I can’t wait to spend time on stage with these people.” Mannion has learned a lot about his limits along with how to push himself out of his comfort zone.
This is the first year Apichell is directingthe freshmen showcase at Post. He discussed his intentions for the play and what he planned to do with the approximately two hours and 10 minutes that his cast commands the stage. “[In] theatre lives we are travelers; that’s what these guys are representing,” Apichell said. The overarching themes tying the eight plays together, he said, are love, loss, denial, and standing up for one’s self.
The plays were selected carefully to match the demographic of the 23 actors. Apichell incorporated all that the first year students have been learning, from the physical displays of the opening and closing number, to the realistic acting of the 10-minute plays. “We all go on journeys, and when you get to your destination, what’s next?” Apichell said.
Nicole Harley, junior musical theater and arts management major, is a first time assistant director for “When We Arrive.” “This is the first performance that initiates [the freshmen] into the PTC family,” Harley said. She and Apichell directed the vision behind the first-years’debut.
Freshman Raechel Johnsky, formerly anacting major, is switching to musical theatre as a result of this production. She is starring in “Now We Are Really Getting Somewhere” and has found a growing confidence and bond due to those around her. Like Mannion, she also values the community of PTC. Along with the excitement of taking the stage for the first time, Johnsky has a clear aim with her performance. “My goal is to make the audience feel something,” Johnsky said, “Even if it’s just one person.”
Freshman musical theatre and political science major Josie Moyer plays the bully-like sister, Sheridan, in “Twenty-Three Hundred Hours.” Moyer is grateful for being surrounded by such great peers and professionals. “The first time we sat here [in the dance studio] and watched each others’ work, it was magical,” Moyer said.
“Hide and Seek” and “When We Arrive” will takes place on the Little Theatre mains tage from April 12 to 15. Performances of each show are at 7:30 p.m. Thursday-Sunday with 3 p.m. matinees on Saturday April 14 and Sunday April 15. Tickets are available at the Little Theatre box office or online at www.tix55.com/ptc700. General admission is $15, students are $10 and seniors are $12.

A well-practiced artist can make even the most abstract idea tangible to the real world, from an owl with a dog’s eyes to floating tree branches, senior art education major Diana Roldan did just that. Her exhibition, “Realm of Dreams,” combined multiple pieces in varying media, from ceramic sculptures to photography. The visual artist immersed the S.A.L Gallery in a vivid world of color from April 3-7. “It’s a reflection of folklore stories from my childhood and inspirations that I’ve had,” Roldan said, “All of it reflects to my life.”
Various pictures lined the walls, including acrylic paintings, photographs, and paper collages. “There’s a narrative in each painting that lets you into their world, into the ‘realm of dreams,’” Roldan said. The pieces showcase specific environments and textures that would be apparent in a dream, in order to give viewers the sensation of existing in that world. One photograph features a close up shot of tree bark, while a silk screen print details broken branches that appear to be floating in space.
A self portrait depicts Roldan as part of her dream realm. “I paintedmy face as realistic, but once you go towards my neck it’s faded out, so I am relaxed and being a part of the environment.” The piece is called “Euphoria,” a name Roldan has bestowed upon numerous elements throughout her career as an artist, such as her social media handles. “It’s something that I have connected with, this state of being happy,” she said. Peace, calmness and coexistence lie at the root of Roldan’s artwork. She uses her art to represent “being free from the stresses of life.”
Every sculpture Roldan featured was hand-coiled, a process used in pottery that allows the sculptor to build outward or inward with less danger of the project collapsing. “I wanted to represent different elements within our earth,” she said. Roldan interpreted herself through a vase with craters, a representation of the moon. Her first name, Diana, is reminiscent of the moon goddess in Roman mythology. Another vase represents water. “The tide is travelling up, as if you’re being consumed by something,” Roldan said.
Her two-year process of creating the exhibition has been fun, successful and empowering. Her primary medium is clay, but she branched out to express herself in various other forms of visual art. “I learned things about myself that I didn’t think that I could do,” she said. Some of these things include patience and her ability to go into detail in her work. “Clay has been a part of me since I was nine, so I’m excited to
see what happens to me as I get older and continue to work with these [other media].”
Sarah Schapira, ‘17, met Roldan as a teacher’s assistant in the campus ceramics studio. “She’s very thoughtful, and [her process is] very detail-oriented without the need to be hyper-realistic,” Schapira said. Roldan immortalized the spirits of her past and current pets, such as her dog “Toki,” within ceramic sculptures such as an owl, a fox, a rabbit, and a dragon. “She looks more for the feeling of what the animal’s representing than what the animal actually looks like,” Schapira said. For many ofher sculptures, Roldan used wax instead of a glaze finish to give them amore realistic texture.
It’s been a difficult yet empowering transition from molding a 3-dimensional object from clay to creating a similar sense of depth within a picture. “When it comes to paintings or drawings, you have to really have skill with shading to create these different values,” Roldan said. She reflected back on pieces she made as a child and challenged herself to further develop or recreate them since they all connect to her personally.
“Art is everywhere. The things that we wear, the things that we see, the buildings; everything was made from art,” Roldan said, “The importance of art is everything.” View more of Roldan’s work on her Instagram @Euphoria524.

Before landing spots on the ABC sitcom “Grown-ish,” some people knew Chloe x Halle from their YouTube channel. The R&B singers used their channel to create and maintain their fan base, covering songs by Beyoncé, John Legend, Cardi B and more. Beyoncé later signed the sisters to her label, Parkwood Entertainment.

They released a mixtape and extended play (EP) while recording for their YouTube channel, but on March 23, they took a bigger step and released their debut album. The sisters recorded the theme song for “Grown-ish” which can be found on the album. They wrote and produced each track, only featuring three other artists: Goldlink, Kari Faux and Joey Bada$$.
The first track of the 18-song album is “Hello Friend.” This track highlights the difference between each sister’s vocals and provides a blueprint to how the album will sound. The following track is the title track. On it, the sisters remind listeners that they may occasionally be rude and annoying, but they can just as easily switch it up and use their intellect to put someone in their place. The song speaks to let listeners know that they can be aware of societal issues and still have fun in life.
“Grown,” the theme song for “Grown-ish,” follows. They use this song to remind us that they are young adults ready to take on the world. “My friend Alyssa was watching “Grown-ish” one night, and I heard the theme song and was instantly drawn in,” Tosin Akinyemi, a freshman biology major, said. “I felt a huge rush of fresh air when I listened to the song on my own time. They are very talented and extremely relatable.”
One of the songs with a featured artist is “Fake,” with Kari Faux.The three girls attack all the people that were once nice to them only to betray them later on. While rapping in the song, Faux questions why people thought she would change who she is to live a deceptive lifestyle, while the sisters question why people put smiles on their faces knowing those people don’t like them. “This song is extremely relatable, especially on this campus, [It seems like] everyone acts like they like you but talks down on you when you’re not present,” Awujola Oke, a senior health major, said.
Overall the album has a great sound, the girls have grown to produce something more than sloppy pop beats. It’s definitely a coming of age album; Chloe and Halle are 17 and 16 respectively and have an authentic R&B sound. They were able to remain themselves on the album while discussing issues that not only matter to them but to many others in their generation. This album can be streamed on all streaming services and bought in stores or on iTunes and Google Play.

For the past seven years, student chamber music ensembles have performed in the Hillwood Recital Hall to showcase music that they have rehearsed all semester. This year’s performance will be directed by music professor Jennifer Scott Miceli. The ensemble consists of undergraduate and graduate music majors, who work on pieces from their repertoire written for the group of instruments they are assigned for the semester.
Three chamber ensembles will perform, featuring students playing the cello, flute, saxophone, and violin. The music department looks forward to bringing vocalists to the concert in the near future, according to Lisa Meyer, production and recruitment coordinator. The students will perform classical music, but the song selections will not be revealed to the audience until the day of the performance.
Students began rehearsing for the performance at the beginning of the spring 2018 semester. Music majors rehearse with a faculty member once a week and rehearse as an ensemble two to three times a week.
The concert gives students an opportunity to perform for an audience and teaches them how to dissect and perfect challenging music in a short period of time through vigorous technical coaching, according to Meyer. “The goal of this course is to increase each student’s caliber of performance, both as a soloist and as a member of the ensemble,” she said. “By the time of the concert, there is usually marked improvement in their technical and musical skills.”
Many students have already performed at least once with an ensemble. “Some have been involved in chamber music ensemblesfrom their first semester,” Meyer said. Each student musician is assigned an individual part to perform; they are a soloist within the context of playing with others in a small, intimate ensemble. “Chamber Music is the best of both worlds: playing as a soloist but still collaborating with others to bring the music to life from the written page,” Meyer said.
The performance will include chamber music dating from the 1700’s to today in various combinations of instruments that are not commonly heard.
The concert, which acts as a final exam for the students, will take place in the Hillwood Recital Hall on Wednesday, April 11, at 12:30p.m. Admission is free.

With recent news reports about humanities programs being reduced or eliminated at different colleges, humanities majors discussed the benefits and values they find in their programs of study.
Humanities disciplines include English literature, writing, philosophy, history, arts, and more. Although some humanities majors express doubts about career prospects, many students who major in the humanities appreciate the time they spend in their studies.
Glenn Magee, chairman of the philosophy department, believes that the humanities are valuable. “Most people go through life as if they are asleep. The task of humanities is to wake them up, and teach them multiple options for living life and for understanding themselves,” he said. “Literature and history do this, and philosophy, my discipline, certainly does, given that it challenges us to question everything, especially what society offers as the ‘approved, politically correct’ truths.
“As far as careers go, employers are looking for graduates who can read, write, and think (a rare commodity, these days). Humanities majors have an advantage, since employers recognize that they are literate, smart, and capable of thinking outside the box. Philosophy majors have higher mid-career salaries, on average, than business majors,” Magee said.
The philosophy department, Magee said, has been doing well, with good enrollment in classes. “I attribute this to the fact that we offer a wide variety of interesting classes, on different topics. We over hauled our course offerings several years ago, with the help of a student focus group we assembled.” As a result of the focus group, redesigned courses such as Happiness and the Good Life, Philosophy and Film, Business Ethics, Philosophies of Love and Sex are now offered since students generally find them exciting and relevant to their lives.
John Lutz, professor of English, however, said that some humanities programs have been cut, including foreign language majors. “This is part of a national trend to instrumentalize knowledge and completely subordinate it to the marketplace. Forms of knowledge that do not directly and obviously translate into monetary gain are being systematically marginalized. We’ve seen some enrollment decline in English,” hesaid. Lutz noted that there has also been an overall drop in enrollment campus-wide over the past several years, not just in the humanities.
.Jenna Curiale, a senior English major, appreciates her major. “I do love the major and enjoy my fellow English students. Also there are a number of great professors in the English department whom I admire,” Curiale said. “I’m very fond of Katherine Hill-Miller, Dr. [John] Scheckter, Margaret Hallissy, Dennis Pahl, and Tom Fahy.” Curiale became an English major after her first semester, when she realized social work wasn’t going to work for her. “English seemed the most practical choicesince it’s always been my favorite subject in school,” she said. “I’ve discovered some wonderful texts like Euripides’ Medea, the novel Push by Sapphire, and one semester I was introduced to Virginia Woolf who untilthat time I had never read.”
Although Griffin Albrecht, a junior political science major, has had second thoughts about majoring in the humanities, he considers his time well spent. “In hindsight I probably wish that I wasn’t pursuing a major in the humanities. If you’re going to pursue something in business,you’re definitely going to have a more secure job prospect. But for mepolitical science and the humanities is something I really enjoy,” he said. Albrecht thinks he has learned valuable skills in his major. “I think my skills in analysis in terms of analyzing works in general, my writing skills and my analysis skills are going to be better than someone who hasn’t had experience in an education in the humanities, whether it be history or understanding political science or theory.”
Thomas Okin, a sophomore art student, is also appreciative of the opportunity to study a field that he is passionate about. “The reason why I picked my art major in particular is because it’s something I’m interested in, and it’s something that I want to make my life based on,” Okin said. “To me at a young age I always wanted to express my feelings but I always have trouble trying to explain, so this is one of the reasons I picked it. It’s relaxing and also helps me express how I am feeling.” Okin is not worried about career prospects.
Lutz stressed the value of humanities. “A simple starting point for understanding the humanities is that they relate to an understanding of self. I think that the most important aspect of humanities disciplines is their capacity to deepen our empathy. Literature, philosophy and languages all encourage habits of self-reflection that enable us to have a better understanding of the human condition in all of its aspects,” he said.

With all the recent hype about gluten free diets, gluten allergies, gluten sensitivities and any other gluten related aliment, it’s hard to decipher what’s been extrapolated by the media and used to suck wallets dry, and what’s factual and backed up by science.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the fact is gluten has gone from being a harmless substance naturally found in wheatand rye, to a genetically modified substance that now has the ability to wreak havoc on the digestive system of not only gluten sensitive individuals, but on everyone who eats it. As confirmed by Kelly Farrell, a medical doctor who writes for the New England Journal of Medicine, genetic modification increases the size of the gluten grain and also makes it more resistant to insect infestation. This increased resistance is due to the unfavorable symptoms the grains produce in bugs such as indigestion and bloating.
The way people feel they are affected by gluten varies in severity. Forinstance, Celiac’s Disease is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks its own intestinal tissue, destroying nutrient absorbing villi and eventually leading to malnutrition and, if left unchecked, other more se-vere autoimmune diseases. However, some people feel that even thoughthey don’t secrete antibodies against gluten like Celiac sufferers do, that gluten affects them in other ways, contributing to bloating, fatigue, headaches and joint pain.
Some scientists argue that since the chemical composition of gluten under a microscope has changed only very little throughout the past few decades, that the demonization of the substance is a bunch of hoopla. On the opposite side, some scientists produce hard data that directly relates gluten to indigestion and the decreased ability of the body to produce protein digesting enzymes in gluten sensitive and insensitive individuals.
Dr. William Davis, a cardiologist from Milwaukee who published a book titled Wheat Belly, concluded in an interview with The New Yorker magazine that as a result of his research, he found that “the version of ‘wheat’ we consume today is a product of genetic research…You and I cannot obtain the forms of wheat that were grown fifty years ago, let alone one hundred, one thousand, or ten thousand years ago.” This seems to be a black and white answer to the gluten issue, however Davis is challenged by the U.S Department of Agriculture agent, Donald Kasadra, who claimed in the same New Yorker piece that “[his] research did not support an increase in the prevalence of Celiac Disease or gluten intolerance on the basis of historical data in comparison with recent data.”
Although more conclusive experiments on gluten and its effects on the body must be performed, the fact remains that each one of us has the ability to control what we choose to eat and, regardless of medical literature, no one knows our bodies more than we ourselves do.

The Pioneers are the only Division II baseball team on Long Island without a turf field, according to head coach Michael Gaffney. Due to inclement weather during the spring 2018 semester, the baseball and softball teams have been forced to practice in the Pratt Recreation Center gymnasium. The baseball field was wet and muddy since the start of the season in February.
Zach Fritz, a sophomore computer science major and first baseman, does not mind practicing indoors. “We just have to suck it up,” he said.
While the gym is not an ideal location, the team can still have batting practice because they have a dropdown batting cage. The gym also has curtains that divide portions of the gymnasium, so the players can hit off a batting tee while ensuring the safety of others. The Pioneers have practiced in the gym for over 30 days according to Fritz.
Grass fields come with disadvantages other than being inappropriate for use after rain or snow. At the beginning of the season, the team briefly practiced on the football field because the grass had not grown enough for practice, according to Debbie DeJong, director of athletics and recreation. Grass fields must be regularly clipped.
There are many reasons why schools keep grass fields. Artificial turf fields are costly. A turf baseball field can cost roughly $750,000, or $4.75per square foot. That’s almost as much as a pretty Italian supercar.
Another reason is increased safety. Turf retains more heat thangrass, meaning that an 80-degree day feels like 90 degrees for the players on the field, according to an NPR story, “High Temps of Turf Fields Spark Safety Concerns.”
Despite being slippery, turf is easier to maintain during the winter. Snow can be pushed off to the side, where it can melt and not interfere with the play area, according to DeJong. If grass gets wet, especially in a baseball game, it can cause serious injuries from puddles that have formed.
For coach Gaffney, the grass field is a benefit for the team. “I think us having [a] natural surface is an advantage, but not enough of an advantage to really impact wins and losses,” he said.
“Having a natural surface is what baseball is still being played on by most MLB teams, and we like to stick to the grassroots,” DeJong said. She isn’t completely ruling out the installation of a turf field, though.
Because the turf football field is so large, it is versatile and can be used for lacrosse, soccer and field hockey as well. The football field is used through the entire year, according to DeJong. As of April 2018, the university has no plans of installing a turf baseball field.

The men’s and women’s outdoor track and field teams hurdled for success on Saturday, April 7 at the Mark Young Invitational at Yale University.
Team member Stefan Adams, a senior health science major, felt confident in his performance. In the 400-meter dash, he finished in first place with a time of 48.37.
Senior criminal justice major, Talya Williams won two races. She came in first place in the 1500-meter race, with a time of 4:46 and first place in the 4×400-meter relay.
Head track and field coach Kevin Buckley was pleased with the team’s success at the invitational. “We had some excellent performances, highlighted by Talya Williams’ strong victory in the 1500, [and] Stefan Adams’ easy win in the 400,” he said.
The Pioneers worked hard to achieve their wins; the weather wasnot ideal for the runners, with temperatures around 46 degrees. “The weather was terrible, but once I started running I was ne. It was hard for me to sit outside and watch my team because it was so cold,” Adams said.
“It was brutal at the beginning of the meet,” Williams said. “It was very windy and freezing but toward the middle to the end the weather got a little warmer but not much. Sometimes it’s a hassle to layer up when racing, it makes my legs feel restricted.”
Coach Buckley is looking forward to warmer weather for the team’s practices. “Practices have been proceeding well, but we could use some warm weather. We have been forced to move many practices in side on the Pratt oval. That is not ideal. It is supposed to be the outdoor season,” he said.
Buckley is aware of the athlete’s fatigue as 15 members have trained since the previous season. “The athletes will be fully rested and prepared for the ECC’s because the coaching staff knows that often ‘less is more’ towards the end of the season,” he said. “The athletes understand the idea that the work they need to do is done and it’s worse to over-train going into a big meet than do little or nothing.”
The Pioneers will next compete in the Metropolitan Championships on April 13 at Rutgers University.

Ambition is one of the most determining factors of any team’s success, and women’s soccer is showing their fighting spirit by training in April for the fall 2018 season. “Right now we’re training for our spring season which is essentially our fall season,” Molly Dowd, freshman biology major, said.
Typically, pre-season training begins near the middle of August and lasts for two weeks. However, due to the short yet intense length of their spring season, the soccer team has already gotten to work strengthening their defensive techniques and individual skills. The games they will play will not count towards their NCAA ranking, as do their games from August to November, but they will be matched up with Division I teams from Hofstra University, Stony Brook University, and Wagner College. “We’re going to have a couple scrimmages to put ourselves together, see what we lost, see what we have, and fit the pieces [together] before wecome into fall,” Dowd said. Since the Pioneers are in Division II, they consider this an opportunity for good competition and to gauge the current standings of their own skills.
Players each have strong abilities, according to Dowd. They meet five times a week to work on skills including first touch and controlling the ball, positioning for offensive strategies, keeping possession against defenders, and shooting the ball. “Goalkeepers work on [shooting] technique when we have to make saves,” Kiarra Grimes, freshman biology major, said, “We’re the last line of defense.”
With many players graduating and leaving the team, remaining members have been working doubly hard to fill the gaps their upperclassmen left behind. “It’s a great opportunity for the younger kids to come forth with leadership,” Coach Mark Dawson said. Players have been adjusting well to their new positions, according to Grimes.
“I think we have a good standing going forward,” Dowd said, “And hopefully we’ll have some new freshman to add into that and make us even better than we are.”
The team is working diligently on improving defense. “We have a hard time sometimes getting back into our positions when there’s a counter-attack,” Grimes said. To compensate for this, the team’s attack strategy greatly counts on outside mid field players to get the ball to the other side of the field towards the opponent’s net.
“We’re just trying to get each individual here better, and then the group better as a team,” Dawson said.
Grimes feels the team needs to work on positioning and communication, “If one person sees something happening, they just don’tsay it,” she said. “You have to be more aware of everyone on the field, not just yourself.”
Keeping physically healthy is a largely important factor in training, “In the matter of a week you could lose your fitness,” Shakila Sevanan, sophomore health science major, said. The athletes have been running track and lifting weights in preparation for fall games.
The team is currently ranked 15th by the NCAA for Division II women’s college soccer, and they aspire to reach the final four by the end of the fall season. “Next year, we feel it’s really attainable with a lot of returning kids and a good freshman class,” Dawson said.
Other sports teams currently in training for a non-traditional season include men’s soccer, football, field hockey, volleyball, and women’s tennis, according to Brian Hughes, associate director of athletics. Teams training in their active, traditional season are baseball, men’s lacrosse, track and field, equestrian, softball, women’s lacrosse, women’s golf, and women’s rugby.

The women’s lacrosse team defeated the University of Bridgeport 15-2 in the East Coast Conference at a home game on April 4.
The team began the game with a 9-0 lead. The Pioneers’ defense kept Bridgeport from scoring until the 6:40 mark. In the second half of the game, the Pioneers were able to remain in the lead until the final goal at 8:53.
The defense was strong, only allowing Bridgeport 16 shots throughout the game. Olivia Kirk, senior, made six saves, and Jill Hummel, sophomore, added one save in relief preventing Bridgeport from gaining advantage.
“I think our biggest asset is that everyone plays really well together and we have a lot of hard workers. I think we are really good at reading each other, and that ability to play together really helps on the field,”Mackenzie Hitchcock, junior attacker for the women’s lacrosse team said. Hitchcock added an assist during the game.
The team is always working on improving their play, “We have hit a few bumps in the road, we had a couple of losses but it showed us where we need to improve,” Hitchcock said. “We come out every day with the goal of getting better and hopefully hitting our best point at the end of the season and going into the playoffs.”
Sophomore mid fielders, Alyssa Mallery and Brianna Feldman aided in the win, with Mallery scoring five goals followed by Feldmanwith four goals, three ground balls and two turnovers.
“Our offense is very dominant, you can’t just shut us down. The team is very unselfish and they really love to play with each other anduse each other to be successful,” coach, Meghan McNamara said.
“Our defense is also very strong. We’re just going to be feeding off of that and continue to keep building and create every option, so we are unstoppable,” she added.
The Pioneers’ next game is Wednesday, April 11 at 4 p.m. against Saint Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, NY.
