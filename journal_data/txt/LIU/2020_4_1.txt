 Kelly Montenero, senior arts management major, is planning on releasing an album this fall with her sister Kat Montenero. Originally, their album was scheduled to come out in May, but due to the COVID-19 virus, it has been postponed until the fall. The tentative name of the album is “New Girl.”
The sisters currently have two singles out called “Nobody Knows” and “One Day.”
They call themselves Kelly & Kat. The duo started singing and taking theatre lessons when they were five years old.
In 2014, they won the Disney “Frozen Sing Your Heart Out Contest,” where their performance was featured on a Kohl’s commercial during the American Music Awards. Ever since then, the sisters have been writing, recording, and performing together.
Kelly’s favorite thing to do on campus is sing. Kelly & Kat have sung for a few of the radio shows on campus. They have also been seen at end of the semester parties and have been on a few podcasts during Kelly’s time as a student at LIU.
Considering their music style as singer/songwriters, they combine their signature harmonies with elements of pop, jazz, and rock. All of their music is original and has been produced, co-written and played on by Adrian Young, the drummer of No Doubt and Quinn Lamont Luke.
“Right now, we have many different audiences all over the world, which is so amazing,” Kelly said. Their music is available on all music streaming platforms under “Kelly & Kat” You can also find them on any social media platform under @Kellyandkat or on Facebook and TikTok under @kellyandkatmusic.

Promise began a new weekly event called Motivation Monday in order to help students feel motivated while social-distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Every Monday students can tag Promise on social media with ways that they are staying active and healthy.
“Motivation Monday is just one of our weekly virtual events we hold on social media to encourage students staying engaged within the community,” Julia Pagano, associate director of Promise, said. “Motivation Monday focuses on ways to stay active, and on mental health awareness. So far, we have shared at-home workouts, Monday miles, yoga and meditation, and tips and resources that focus on mental health.”
The weekly event is open for anyone to participate in. “Anyone is able to participate in the Motivation Monday activities,” Pagano said. “We encourage those who participate to tag LIU Promise on social media, but it is not required. LIU Promise’s main goal for Motivation Monday is to remind students to stay active, and to not forget about self-care.”
Due to many students not being able to access the campus, the event was made so students can participate no matter where they are.
“We have tailored all of our virtual engagement to fit the current situation of our students, faculty, staff, and community,” Pagnao said. “Motivation Monday can be completed in the comfort of one’s home, inside or outside.”
Promise is also looking for feedback on how they can improve the event in the future.
“ Relying solely on virtual engagement is something new to campuses around the world, and we encourage students to provide LIU Promise feedback,” Pagano said. “We want to continue to provide our students with fun and attractive activities, as well as highlight areas such as clubs, organizations, academic departments, and athletics.”

There are some students on campus who are largely concerned about the health of our planet, and one thing they can do to help is recycle. However, some students have noticed a lack of recycling bins, especially in the dorm buildings. As a result, some students may be wondering whether recyclables are collected on campus at all.
In Post Hall, the only recycling bins in the first floor trash room. Mattew Sporrer, a sophomore theatre and international relations major and RA in Post, was upset by this. He regularly recycles when he’s at home in Illinois, but he has found this task difficult since he came to live on campus.
“I think campus should bring recycling into more public places, like Hillwood and Winnick where it serves the whole community. Not just tucked away in some corner for only residents who know it’s there,” Sporrer said. He also thinks that if recycling is an inconvenience, then people are more negligent to do it, including himself. He concluded that if the campus makes the issue more known, then people are more likely to try recycling.
Alyssa Spagna, a freshman musical theatre major, is also concerned about the difficulty of on-campus recycling. She routinely tried to recycle but found it complicated to do. She lives in Queens Hall where there is only one recycling bin in the lobby. “There should be at least one on each floor of all of the freshman buildings so it is not a mystery to find,” she said. “Having recycling bins in sight on campus is another simple task that this university is failing to complete.”
One student took it upon himself to help make a positive difference. Louis Copertino, senior public relations major and RA in Riggs Hall, completed a recycling program in his dorm. Copertino aimed to raise awareness regarding recycling amongst students. “I was planning on taking the money from the recycled bottles and cans to donate it to Relay for Life,” he said.
One of Copertino’s personal priorities is taking care of the environment, so recycling is very important to him. “I was outside the RA office encouraging residents to donate and recycle for some chocolate, candies, and a conversation with RA Louis,” he said.
The resident directors in Post Hall and Promise staff members did not provide any comment about the matter.

Students who avoid watching the news lately may not be aware of the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical devices due to COVID-19.
New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has spoken daily on the matter to inform the public about the widespread scarcity of key supplies such as gowns, gloves, masks, ventilators and blood. Over 50,000 people have become infected with COVID-19 in New York state as of March 29, some of whom were hospitalized due to severe symptoms.
It is prevalent that healthcare workers take every possible precaution to keep themselves healthy, especially during a pandemic. In order to care for the public, nurses, doctors and other medical workers must make sure that they can take care of themselves first.
“There is a shortage of N95 masks,” Theresa Cunzo, a nurse at RWJ University Hospital, said. “Respirator masks essentially filter out the particles that are left in the air. These masks are a major way to protect us.”
Harbor Freight Tools, a nationwide tool and home improvement retailer with locations throughout the United States, announced it was donating protective gear after receiving 13,000 applications from hospitals and over 43,000 email recommendations from customers. The tool company said they were giving 44 million pairs of nitrile gloves and hundreds of thousands of masks and face shields to hospitals in over 1,000 communities that their stores serve, according to a March 26 announcement.
“I think it is a great thing,” Samantha Ubel, a junior broadcasting major, said. “Our healthcare workers need all the help they can get in this critical time period.”
Another contributor to the cause is fashion designer Christian Siriano. After promising Gov. Cuomo help with New York’s medical supply shortage, Sirino and his team of seamstresses created almost 1,000 N95 masks.
“It was really a simple thing and I just felt like it was a really important time because it felt like it was so needed; not just in New York, but everywhere,” Siriano commented.
The designer stated that his team has to follow certain guidelines when making the masks. They must be tested to make sure they work and then must be approved by Gov. Cuomo himself before they are given the seal of approval. They are even washable, which makes them reusable, according to Siriano, who tweeted at Cuomo saying, “If @NYGovCuomo says we need masks my team will make some. I have a full sewing team still on staff working from home that can help.”

As the world continues to react to the COVID-19 situation, schools in affected areas have temporarily shut down or asked their students to leave campus, but select areas on Post campus remain open for business until further notice.
While students were encouraged to return home by New York state, they were welcome to stay on campus if they wished. All resident buildings are still open for students, but with some new rules in place.
According to several emails from the school, students were informed that those living on campus cannot have any guests, even if they attend the school. On top of that, students who decide to stay on campus will no longer have access to places like Starbucks, Hillwood Cafe and Bamboo.
“Only Winnick and The Pod is open which limits my food options and makes it almost impossible to use up my dining dollars, which is pretty unfair,” Joseph Sear, a junior accounting major, said.
In Winnick, dining-in is no longer allowed and has become a grab-and-go set up. Sear isn’t the only resident who feels this way.
“Even though most buildings are closed down and the dining hall’s hours are shortened, they seem determined to keep from having to refund students,” Aren Antreasyan, a senior film major, said.
Although the campus made it clear that students are welcomed to stay on campus, many students have returned home for the remainder of the semester. “The campus feels like a ghost town,” Antreasyan said. “You don’t see many people besides the janitors and occasional public safety officer.”
Other than refunds, another common concern was expressed by students who returned home or left during spring break. While the state’s mandated orders remain, some students may need to return to campus to get things they left behind in their rush to get home. Whether a resident is looking to return to their dorm, or to simply retrieve the last of their items, there are new things to consider.
Promise Director Ashley John said that when entering the campus, students must come through the west gate and display their ID to the officer at the gate. Students should also contact their resident director before they head to campus to let them know they’re coming to move out, retrieve items or move back in. Other than these minor changes, students are free to come back to campus when necessary; however, unless it is an emergency, all students and their families should stay home during this time.

Some businesses and food chains have changed the way they handle everyday business amidst the new coronavirus pandemic, with some being forced to shut down completely as social-distancing is encouraged across America.
For this reason, sit-down dining is no longer an option at all New York restaurants and chains. There is no date as to when restaurants can reopen for business.
But some dining establishments have resorted to pickup and delivery as an alternative, including some local to campus.
For students who chose to remain in their residence hall, there are plenty of different options.
For a breakfast fix, Greenvale Bagels, located right off Northern Boulevard, is offering call-ahead pick up orders.
For a quick and easy bite, Moe’s Southwest Grill in Greenvale is offering curbside pick-up or delivery. Another quick and inexpensive option is Abeetza Pizza in Greenvale, who is also offering curbside pick-up or delivery.
Junior Rachel Masullo, typically a frequent customer of Moe’s Southwest Grill, said she will continue to support them by ordering take-out.
“I’m definitely going to continue ordering take-out from Moe’s. It’s definitely weird not being able to go inside and order, but I guess that’s just the time we’re living in now,” she said.
For larger dinners or meals, Vincent’s Clam Bar in Carle Place is offering curbside pickup or delivery. On the Border in Hicksville is also open for curbside pick-up or delivery.
There are many off-campus dining options still available for students remaining on campus. With plenty of delivery options, having a car is not a necessity to be able to enjoy off-campus dining options.
Freshman Kelly Johnston believes in the importance of supporting local businesses during this time.
“I will definitely continue to support local businesses,” she said. “It’s a difficult time for many smaller and local restaurants because they’re not getting their usual foot traffic,” Johnston said, “I know I can help them out in maybe a small way by ordering take-out once in a while during this time.”

While the COVID-19 positive count continues to increase daily, the situation may seem less serious to students without symptoms who don’t know a friend, family member or co-worker with a confirmed case.
But the United States has become the country hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic as of March 26, surpassing China, according to the New York Times.
America is said to have at least 164,000 people infected with COVID-19 as of March 31, including over 67,000 in New York state, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Lydia Fraga, sophomore biomedicine major, does not have the coronavirus. Fraga is from Madrid which has the highest case count in Spain, making it temporarily impossible for her to return home. Therefore, she decided to reside with Kelsey Wright, junior education major who also doesn’t have the virus, for the rest of the semester.
“Thankfully, no one in my family has contracted COVID-19,” Fraga said. “Since everything is on lockdown in Spain, no one is allowed to be out in public. If a police officer catches you, you must pay a fee. The only way to go out is if you are going grocery shopping or walking a dog; one person per dog.”
Wright said she’s enjoyed living with Fraga and that she isn’t afraid of catching the new coronavirus.
“We made a fake campus in the basement, and have been painting often,” Fraga said.
Emily Tirado, a sophomore health science major who lives in Suffolk County, said she also does not have the new coronavirus and isn’t afraid of contracting it either. To stay occupied while at home, she works out in her backyard and goes on family walks.
“To prepare for lockdown, my family has stocked up on food. We go to the store once a week,” Tirado said. “My parents are working from home and my two sisters, one in college and one in high school, are all learning at home because of COVID.”
Julia Duffy, senior business administration major from Nassau County, doesn’t have COVID-19 either.
“I am afraid of getting coronavirus because I had the swine flu in 2009 and I have asthma,” Duffy said. “I haven’t left my house in about a week. My mom goes and gets groceries for the family.”
None of her family members have the virus, but her sister has a friend who has it who isn’t from the area.
“To pass time, I watch Netflix, do my online classes, and work out on the treadmill,” Duffy said.
Government officials, as well as medical workers on the frontlines, are taking care of the situation while they still can. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci said the world could see over one million deaths if the virus isn’t contained.
So while the situation for some may not hit close to home, the battle against the virus is far from over. To avoid creating a real-life version of “Contagion,” Fauci highly recommends obeying the state’s stay-at-home orders to ensure the virus curve flattens.

While some courses can seamlessly be moved online, those majoring in the arts may find it difficult to participate in class. To assist them while attending class remotely, the school has provided Adobe Creative Cloud for students to download and utilize at home.
COVID-19 has affected the education system all over the country. Most high schools and universities moved learning completely online for the remainder of the school year.
Some students don’t have Adobe programs like Photoshop or Premiere on their computers or laptops, so assignments like photo and video editing or graphic design projects could be impossible to complete.
Adobe is doing their part by providing free Creative Cloud packages for students. Photoshop, Lightroom, InDesign, Audition, and others are all available for free temporarily. Adobe hopes to remove some of the pressures off of students and teachers while they’re dealing with moving classes online, according to a statement released by Adobe.
Post is just one of the many schools that received the free Creative Cloud package.
“It was super easy to download. I just followed the link, put in my LIU email, and downloaded it,” Jeffrey Lizo, a freshman communications major, said. “It’s going to make my classes much more manageable at home.”
Normally, the program costs $20 per month for student subscribers. Lizo recommends that students who don’t already have the program should take advantage of the offer.
“I’m really appreciative that Adobe released it for free for students,” he said.Some students did just that, regardless of their major, when they saw the posts about the offer online.
“I’m a musical theater major, so I don’t need Adobe Creative Cloud for my classes, but when I saw that they were letting LIU students download it for free, I got it immediately,” Hannah Hrbek, a sophomore musical theater major, said. “As another art student, I’m glad that they provided this for students who might not have access to this software at home.”
Hrbek said she’s been playing around with all the different apps in the suite a little bit everyday.
“I don’t know how to use everything yet, but it’s something keeping me entertained,” she said.
To download Adobe Creative Cloud on your device, go to https://it.liu.edu/adobe/. A valid school email must be entered to access the software.

Nassau County Legislator Joshua Lafazan, who also teaches a course on foundations of entrepreneurship, hosted a donation drive for personal protective equipment (PPE) on Saturday, March 28, with the Syosset-Woodbury Chamber of Commerce and Accounting Brew at the Syosset Library.
“Quite frankly, our healthcare workers are on the frontlines of the war against the virus,” Lafazan said. “We want to make sure they are protected and equipped with everything they need.”
The 26-year-old legislator said it was his job as an elected official to put people together and mobilize for action, which is how the idea of the donation drive came about.
Supplies needed include N95 and surgical masks, eye protection like goggles or face shields, no-touch thermometers, HEPA filters for ventilators, hand sanitizer, disinfectant cleaners, medical gloves, disposable medical gowns, and medical shoe covers.
Before the drive began, Lafazan had already started receiving donations.“We expect the drive to go great, we’ve already received 500 masks from the East End Group,” Lafazan said.
Supplies donated will be given to the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management to undergo protocols to sanitize the donated items for distribution.
Brianna LoBianco, a senior health science major, works at Northwell Urgent Care calling patients into the exam room, gathering information about the patients for the doctors, and performing care testing.
“Lately, the patient flow has increased tremendously because everyone is concerned about possible exposure to coronavirus,” LoBianco said.
Northwell Urgent Care can only test essential workers for the COVID-19 because of orders from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to LoBianco.
“There are times I feel extremely grateful and proud to be able to help those in need and there are times I feel scared and anxious [about the pandemic],” LoBianco said.
Lafazan and his office offer additional ways to help aid the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, including a senior shopping initiative for those above age 50 in Nassau County.
“It’s where a senior who cannot leave their house, or is too nervous to, can call my office and we’ll pair them with a volunteer to go shopping with them,” Lafazan said.
For more information or to volunteer he can be reached at his office phone number, (516) 571-6218.
LoBianco urges people to stay inside their homes unless they absolutely cannot.
“The number of positive cases is increasing day by day and it’s so important that we stop the spread of this,” LoBianco said.
