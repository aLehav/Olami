Just about everyone makes a New Years resolution. Maybe you want to get better at running so you can run a half-marathon, or you want to be neater so you can actually see the floor of your room. No matter what your resolution for 2016 is, it is practically inevitable that you will break it. Actually, I can promise at some point you will break it, and that some point was probably Jan. 3.
For those who have not yet broken their New Years resolution, and are trying their best to stick to it, here are some tips:
Use an agenda/planner
“Make a chart with a hand written check list, and physically check off each accomplishment,” suggested Ariana Franz, a freshman music education major.
Having your daily schedule written out will help you stay on track of what you need to do. If your resolution was eating healthier, staying organized, running, etc. you can write down your daily goal. You’re more likely to stick to your resolution if you have it written down for everyday. You write your homework and assignments down to make sure you complete them everyday, so why not write down to go running, or something healthy to eat everyday?
Download tracking apps
There is an app for everything. If you’re a shopaholic and want to cut down on your spending you can download apps that monitor how much you spend. Apps like Mint, available for iPhone and Android users, helps manage your spending, saving, budgeting, and earning. By connecting your bank account to the app you can track how much money you can spend, and divide it up into budgets like clothes, groceries, and restaurants.
If you’re training to be on American Ninja Warrior, you can download any of the Nike Training apps. These apps monitor how much you move throughout the day, how far and how fast you ran, and suggest workouts that you can do at home or at the gym. Under Armor also has an app to track what you eat, in terms of vitamins and nutrients you need to meet daily, called myFitnessPal.
Using one of these available apps makes you more conscious of what you spend, what you eat, and what you do to stay healthy.
If you’re new to the health game, worry not. Physicians suggest at least 30 minutes of exercise everyday. Head over to Pratt and either get your fitness on by yourself, with a trainer, or take one of the fitness classes offered. Classes offered range from yoga, to kickboxing; schedules can be found in the Pratt Recreation Center.
Maybe skip going out?
At the beginning of the semester, almost everyone has the goal of getting an A in all of their classes. Sometimes it happens, and sometimes, for the fifth semester in a row you find yourself saying, “C’s get degrees.” We all know you’re smart enough to get that A, but we also see you checking into a different bar on Facebook every week. Maybe skip the bar every now and then. Going out is fun, and during college is probably the best time to go out, but don’t give up on those A’s. “Fear of missing out” (FOMO) is real, but so is that 15-page paper due next Tuesday that you haven’t started yet.
Say no
As if it is your job. Saying “no” is frequently in the top ten resolutions people make each year. If you’re too busy, too stressed, or really just can’t bring yourself to do something optional, say “no.” You don’t want to let people down, but if you don’t have the time to babysit for six hours, work an extra shift, write four papers, go grocery shopping for your mom, and drive your friend to the optometrist, just say “I’m sorry, I really just don’t have the time.” It’s an easy way to say no without offending anyone.
Get your friends involved
“Tell your friends about your goal! They are essentially your moral support group,” said Franz. Having a support system to keep you on track will turn your resolution from a chore to a fun activity you can do together.
Say yes
Sometimes what can hold us back from being spontaneous or having fun is fear. “My New Year’s resolution was to start doing more of what makes me happy and live in the moment,” said freshman adolescence education major Alanna Jones. “To help achieve my resolution I am trying to say yes to things I wouldn’t normally do.”

Have you ever looked at your camera roll and felt like you’ve gone back in time? Pictures and videos can capture a lifetime of moments and memories that allow you to relive your past as if it was yesterday. It’s always nice when you look through your phone and you stumble upon that picture from a special night, or vacation, or a time when you tried something new. They say that pictures are worth a thousand words; these students were able to express why a special photo on their camera means so much to them.
“This is photo is of me, Megan Draghi and Sarah Hecht. It was an impromptu picture taken in Winnick in 2015 after not seeing each other for a few weeks. This photo describes our friendship: warm, charming and definitely random. If it weren’t for these beautiful women, my years at Post would definitely be dull. Love you Dragster and Sasha!” Diana Zysk, senior international business major.
“The most important photo on my camera roll was taken freshmen year at Post. Here I stand with someone whom I didn’t imagine meeting at LIU Post. Freshmen year was filled with trials, errors, scheduled naps, and endless laughter. College is all about making memories with new people and old, who often become some of the most important people in our lives. Thanks for offering a shoulder to lean on. We’ve both grown so much on this journey and I’m thankful to have you by my side LIU Post Pioneer!…JK my BFF GAB.” Jennifer Mejia, senior art therapy major.
“This is a picture of the LIU Post Cheerleading team after finishing up a very hardworking few days at NCA Cheerleading Camp. This camp was held at Boston University over the summer. I picked this picture because this team is the definition of a family to me. They are great motivators and supporters. A great team for me to rely on when I need them the most.” Salina Webson, sophomore criminal justice major.
The women’s volleyball team shared their Senior Night at the Pratt Center last semester. “My whole family made the trip up just to see me play my last match for Post. My parents didn’t tell me my grandma [and] uncle were coming, so I was really surprised and so happy. Everyone was wondering why my mom rented a minivan until the whole gang showed up three days later. Grandma brought everyone their own lei and boxed Hawaiian chocolates just because she could. I’ll never forget that day.” Rachel Ringor, senior nance and international business major.
 
Most people can relate to that moment when you get to see your friends or family after a long time. The moment you see everyone after a long break or busy week and it just makes all the difference. Being a part of a team, like volleyball or cheerleading builds a family and community that make endless memories through the wins and losses. These are only a few of the photos that resonate with your fellow Pioneers. A picture holds special moments that you can always look back on and appreciate, share and love. If you have a picture you would like to submit to The Pioneer, please email us at: liupostpioneer@gmail.com

See Black Sabbath for the last time
Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler are roaming through the states one last time, and they’ll stop by Madison Square Garden. They are getting awfully close to a 50-year career (48 this year), but because of health problems here and there, they are calling it quits. You should see them live one last time because they are Black Sabbath, and there are no others like them. A genre-defining, groundbreaking band, and there will never be another chance to see them again. “Is this the end of the beginning? Or the beginning of the end?”
Black Sabbath plays at MSG on Feb. 25 and 27, and a third show has been set up at the Nikon at Jones Beach Theatre on August 17. Tickets are available now at Ticketmaster.
Go to the Whitney Museum of American Art and make up your mind
The new Whitney Museum opened last year, and received a lot of good reviews in newspapers and magazines. However, the more I hear people talk about modern art while being the A&E editor, the more I doubt if many of you know what classifies as modern art. I have seen the viral picture of a glove at the MoMA where people walk around it, unsure whether it is an installation or not. That is not how it is. The bandwagon is not the place to be. That is why you should take a day, go there and see for yourself. The people there might be snobby, but the stuff on the walls is not. Social commentary, commentary on the art world itself. It is not a glove on the floor, or “I could do that myself.” It can be beautiful or ugly, but it is sure worth it.
See the New York Philharmonic play Brahms’ A German Requiem
A hidden little gem, among youth it seems, is the New York Philharmonic. A premiere symphony orchestra with a wide variety of concerts throughout the season. Brahm’s wrote the Requiem after the death of his mother. It is an epic piece of orchestral music. Unlike the ugliness you might find at the Whitney or the Black Sabbath concert, this is purely beautiful. It is a calming experience in the middle of the semester. A heartfelt tribute to his mom. “Selig sind die Toten.” “Blessed are the dead.”
Tickets are on sale through www.nyphil.org and they will play A German Requiem several times in March.
