The 2012 LIU Post Career Fair was held on Wednesday, March 28th, in the Tilles Center from 11:30 to 2:30 p.m.
LIU Post’s Career Services hosted the event. Forty-four companies were there in search of future employees and applicants for internship programs.
A diverse group of companies were in attendance to cater to all different majors, including TD Bank, CSA, Prudential Financial, PriMedia, Inc., Cablevision, Victoria’s Secret, Send in the Clowns, New York Life, Walk Radio, Island Photography, the U.S. Army Reserve, and Harbor Child Care.
The Director of Cooperative Education at LIU Post, Alice Baumer, planned the event. “We’re in a unique situation; there are more internships available than students applying for them,” Baumer said. Baumer strongly recommends that students apply for internships and mentioned that the Cooperative Education office will work with students one on one to find internships for their specific majors. To get an internship through the Cooperative Education office, students must complete a non-credit, four-class workshop called Enriched Experience Education, which gives students tips for getting internships, jobs and interviews. Students must also have accounts with Job Net, a website that helps both college students and college graduates find jobs and internships. To sign up with Job Net, students simply must go on Jobnet.com and put in their contact information.
Baumer expressed the advantages of internship experience for students. If one thinks he or she is interested in a specific job or field, he or she should try it out to see if he or she enjoys it because there is a change that he or she might not, said Baumer. “By the time students graduate, they know exactly what they want to do in their career,” said Baumer.
Many students who attended the Career Fair found it very helpful. Phuong Nguyen, a junior Business Administration major, is determined to get a summer internship and said she found a lot of companies there for her major. She came completely prepared, dressed professionally with 40 resumes printed. “I had an internship last summer in Vietnam in Finance. It was very helpful in letting me know that I am not the person for that job,” Nguyen said. Nguyen changed her major after that experience.
Shawn Dang, a sophomore also majoring in Business, is looking for a summer internship as well. “I’m looking for an internship in financial services,” said Dang. He never had an internship before and wants real work experience.
This was the second Career Fair for Kariaine Rojas, a sophomore who is majoring in both Early Childhood Education and Special Education. Rojas found the Fall 2011 Career Fair very helpful because it is where she found her current work-study job in office management. She hopes this job fair is just as successful. “Now, I’m looking for a summer job. I will be living on Long Island, and it is expensive,” said Rojas.
Some students found the Career Fair a bit overwhelming. Alex Zhang, a sophomore majoring in International Business, felt intimidated. “I felt like companies expect experience before you start an internship, which I don’t really have,” said Zhang. Other students felt that they were not quite ready. “I feel it is very difficult for some international students to get an internship here. I feel that my English is not advanced enough,” said Wenjia Shang, a graduate student studying Public Administration.
The Career Fair had a great turn out with “more students this year than in the past,” said Kimberly Brown, a career development counselor. After attending the fair, Brown advised students to contact their perspective employers. “Students should follow up with thank you notes and wait for their calls,” advised Brown. If you would like to contact Cooperative Education, the phone number is 516-299-2251, and the email address is careerservices@cwpost.liu.edu.

On Monday, March 26th, two Public Relations professionals shared their experiences at the 18th annual Public Relations Explorations Forum in the Tilles Center Patron’s Lounge.
The two guest speakers presented career information and shared tips from their own experiences in the Public Relations world with students, faculty and staff.
“Students hear [at this event] what employers and clients expect and how new technologies are used to improve communication with audiences,” said Associate Professor and Director of the Public Relations Degree Program Abby Dress. She added, “The event also builds and cements relationships between practitioners and our program to provide an advantage for our students when they seek jobs.”
Former broadcast journalist, Account Supervisor in DGK Public Relations, Marketing and Government Affairs Liz Burke, along with former aspiring actress and model, 2007 LIU Post graduate and Associate Vice President at Rubenstein Public Relations Laura Salerno, stumbled into the PR profession in different ways. Their combined knowledge illustrated a diversity in jobs and tasks within the business. The presentations were followed by a question and answer session, along with the opportunity to network and to have refreshments. The event was hosted by the LIU Post Chapter of the Public Relations Students Society of America (PRSSA) and was sponsored by the Media Arts department and the LIU Post Public Relations Office.
“Our PRSSA´s mission is to provide education about the field from career paths and types of activities professionals handle to the strategic planning and new technologies employed,” Dress explained. The Explorations Forums have existed since 1995, with a mission to provide students, faculty and staff with an opportunity to meet and listen to guest speakers who represent various fields within the Public Relations profession.
“I think it was really interesting; I always enjoy lectures from PR professionals because they do now what I hope to be doing in a couple of years,” said sophomore Public Relations major Joella Skoogh. “I valued the tips Laura and Liz had for us, especially since they gave similar tips, which made you understand the importance of them,” she added, explaining how she learned the importance of building strong relationships with journalists.

Lively music and fresh lunch drew students to the Hillwood Commons outdoor patio during Common Hour on Thursday, March 29th.
Funded by the Student Government Association, the second annual Diversity Barbeque was the final event of Diversity Week, which had been running since Monday, March 26th.
During the Barbeque, hamburgers, chicken, corn, and hot dogs were served. Some students were even tempted to show off their dancing skills while listening to the music of DJ Runna (junior Computer Science major David Johnson).
“Our mission was to unify our diverse campus and to gather students to talk, get to know each other and have fun,” said sophomore Digital Art and Design major Kiara Braithwaite, who was part of the committee that planned the event, along with sophomore Broadcasting major Melinda Gonzalez. “We want people to socialize and network,” Gonzales added. Attracted by promotional flyers, Hillwood speaker announcements, loud music, and the smell of food, students came in groups or by themselves to join the barbeque during lunchtime.
All of the tables on the Hillwood outdoor patio were occupied, and as the food disappeared, several students got up to dance and enjoy the hit songs, which were blasting through the speakers. Others remained seated to chat.
One table was occupied by freshmen Accounting majors Peiwen Xue and Wushuang Han and freshman Marketing major Zhuyun Yang, who are from China. The three girls were excited to taste the food and explained that the music and the people created a happy atmosphere. They were not the only ones enjoying the event. “The food was awesome, and I was starving,” said Swedish, sophomore International Business major Julia Sandstrom. Senior Speech Pathology major Angelica La Lota agreed. “This was fun. Everyone loves free food,” she said. Excited students and empty boxes signified a well-executed event. SGA´s Braithwaite was satisfied with the outcome.
“It was successful; all the food is gone, and the whole event turned out really well,” she said.

Dr. Michael Soupios is an institution within himself at LIU-Post. Ask any student on campus about his classes and nine times out of ten the feedback will be great. With four doctorates and four masters degrees, Dr. Soupios considers himself to be very lucky in his career here at Post, since this is the only full-time job he’s ever had. We sat in his office in Hoxie Hall, which is filled with ancient Greek art and pictures of his family, for an interview.
When he started here in 1977, he was an administrator as that was the only position available. By 1988, he was teaching full-time, although he only taught night classes since the beginning. Currently, Dr. Soupios teaches Political Science 1 and 2, various political science honors courses, and is a graduate advisor. He enjoys teaching the introduction classes because it’s mostly comprised of freshmen and sophomores who have no experience with the topic. “I like to think they start to listen, to think, and to understand political philosophy,” he said.
What has kept Soupios here so long are his good Long Island roots. He and his family moved to the Island from the city when he was a child. He has raised his family here and now one of his children is starting their family here as he has a four-year-old granddaughter. “Those are the titles that count; Prof, dada, and grandpa,” he said. Although he has been offered a number of other jobs and been nominated for other administration positions, he turned them all down, without question, having no interest in any of them.
However, at this point in his career, he does not think that Post has changed for the better over the past 30 years. “Unfortunately the campus has gotten bureaucratized,” said Soupios. He feels that there is now too much administration which has led to a lack of quality relationships. “People are unwilling to extend themselves that little bit extra, they hid behind the rules,” he said. Soupios has seen the campus become “rigid and juridical.” He said this is a negative trend to move towards because it has led to “armed union camps” and it wasn’t like that years ago.
As much as he is bothered by some of the administrative decisions that have been made over the past 30 years, he has had a plethora of good memories too. His best Post memory is receiving the Chancellors Award a couple of years ago. He was given a medallion and all of his students, colleagues, and his wife were there. Soupios even got a surprise visit from an old friend who didn’t tell him that he was going to be there.
I read two entries I found on www.ratemyprofessor.com to Dr. Soupios to see what he thought; he has never actually been on the site.
“This man is a legend. Take his class, feel the wonder that is Soupios. Your life will be better for it.”
“Dr. Soupios is the most engrossing professor I’ve encountered at Post. He’s eloquent and understanding. Hilariously candid too. Couldn’t recommend him more.”
His face lit up as a huge grin appeared across his face. “It makes you feel very good. As a professor that’s what you want to hear,” he said, laughing to himself.  Students that write on www.ratemyprofessor.com aren’t the only ones with good things to say about this “legend.”
Senior Broadcasting major, Matt Soldano, said, “I’m a big fan of his. He made someone with no interest in political science, interested.” Followed by sophomore Journalism major, David Otero, who said, “He made the topic a lot more interesting than any other professor could. He made you want to come to class.”
As I am also a former student of his, it was nice to hear that Dr. Soupios has no immediate plan to retire. “Man proposes but God disposes,” he said, meaning that he would like to continue working as long as the big guy upstairs will allow it. He’d like to put in a total of 50 years.
So for anyone who has not taken Political Science 1 and 2 yet, Dr. Soupios plans on sticking around to teach it for a little while longer; and as you can see he comes highly recommended.

Being a former victim of Catholic School, it was important for us students to personalize ourselves since we were wearing the same exact thing. So when you’re on the road, sometimes you’ll see some crazy decorations on vehicles. It’s hard to be driving a car that more than a thousand people will probably have and look different, but you can do it by making some simple changes.
License Plates: Customizing your license plates is not only fun, but it gets attention on the road. I love reading crazy license plates – it not only makes you seem different, but the people in back of you can enjoy trying to figure out what your license plate means. The price to customize costs between $60 and $100, depending on the time you order it.
Stickers – I used to have a bunch of stickers in my back window. Stickers like  Tinkerbell, Jimmy Buffett, and a flower. After my sister took over the car, she added a pair of lips and New York Giants sticker. My newer car holds a New York Mets sticker to show my pride. In my window, I also have a New York Mets tassel and a pair of dice. Some drivers like to put their sports team’s stickers, band stickers, and some funny sayings.
Lights/Tinting/Systems – I’m not all for having a “sick” system in my car, but I can appreciate why people do get it. The time that we most often listen to music is in the car, so spending money on a good stereo system may be worth it. If you’re into that, go for it – people are definitely going to hear what you’re listening to as well, if that’s your goal. Tinting windows to a certain degree is a good idea, but it’s also illegal to have if they are too dark, so be aware. Lights are also tricky. Having different color headlights and taillights are also illegal, but adding on lights to the bottom of the front bumper or windshield is legal and looks different and good when done right.
Other simple ways to make an impression are decorating your vehicle during certain holidays, having a car theme (I’ve seen Hello Kitty-themed cars before) or just keeping your car extra-clean. People notice dirty cars, but really clean cars definitely get noticed. They just look better making you look like a million bucks. So don’t be afraid to personalize your vehicle, no matter how ridiculous it may seem.

Well, that dreaded time of year is fast approaching for many of us: bathing suit season. Whether you are on hunt for something a little more flattering or you are just looking to try something new, this is the article for you. Bathing suit shopping and bathing suit season in general can be two of those most infuriating and sometimes depressing things a girl goes through. After compiling some research together, I am proud to present a few tips and tricks to use when picking the perfect bathing suit for your body type.
If you are smaller on top, I suggest looking for bathing suit tops with a touch of padding or underwire that will make the most of your bust line. Try to find tops with adjustable straps at the shoulders and even around the back so that you can adjust things if need be. Accentuate your body type by picking out cute, ruffled or similarly decorated tops. Opt for purchasing tops and bottoms separately instead of a set. Avoid tops with too much fabric or are too unstructured.
If you are larger on top, extra support is a must so once again look for underwire tops that will make you feel comfortable and secure. Halter-tops are recommended because they offer support while showing off your best assets. Wider shoulder straps will provide added comfort and security. Avoid strapless, bandeaus, or tiny tops that offer minimal coverage.
If you have a longer body type, you can get away with lots of embellishments at the hips and the bust. Horizontal striped tops and bright colors are highly suggested. If you’re in the market for a one-piece, try one with cut-outs. It will break up your longer torso, just like a bikini but with a touch more coverage. Avoid vertical stripes, dark and solid colors, and high necklines.
If you have a shorter torso or legs, highlight your figure by finding a suit cut high on the thigh. This will elongate the legs. Remember, vertical strips can create the allusion of lengthening the body. Solid bottoms with a printed top draw the eye upward and give you a longer appearance. Solid one-pieces create a continual, long look.
If you want to look curvier, wear a one-piece with a high cut on the thigh. A cinched in or belted waistline shapes your waist. Gravitate towards bikinis if you are comfortable or confident enough. Add some illusion at the hips with ruffles, bows, and more. Dark, solid colored bottoms and wild tops create the appearance of curves. Avoid solid colored or horizontally striped one-pieces though.
If you are plus size or fuller figured, look for one-piece swimsuits with lace or mesh detailing. A purposefully place cut-out or deep v-neck can alter your visual image. Lengthen the thigh with “ruched” details at the hips. Sarongs can give you added glamour and confidence. As you might have guessed, darker colors are more flattering. Avoid too much fabric and bright neon colors. Modesty is certainly valued but being too covered up isn’t necessarily better. If you are self conscious about your midsection, try a control panel swimsuit. Tankinis are a really great option because they provide just enough coverage while still being hip. Some minor draping around the waist or hips also helps conceal any imperfections or insecurities.
No matter what your body type or confidence level, I promise you that your perfect bathing suit exists. As difficult as I know it is, try not to stress out about shopping for bathing suits. At the end of the day as long as you feel confident, you will not only look but feel great as well. Bathing suits can be found in practically any store these days so the options are endless. Happy bathing suit shopping, ladies!

I was looking through Kahlil Haywood’s former column, “Damn He Got a Point” (last year’s relationship column), in the hope that something would spark an idea for this week’s column. I stumbled across one entitled, “Red Alert!” It was the possibility of girls becoming extraordinarily bitchy when their time of the month rolls around. He suggested that it’s something we can control and therefore, we should keep ourselves in check.
Ha! As if we could do so if we tried. It’s not as if we wake up in the morning and say to ourselves, “Ya know, I have acutely sharp, debilitating cramps so I think I’ll be a completely irrational raging bitch today to make up for it.” Sorry fellas, that’s not really how it works. If you knew anything about getting your period, you’d know that during that time our hormones are out of control. This causes us to be overly emotional and sometimes even irrational. We may overreact and be somewhat bitchier than usual.
With all due respect to Kahlil, do not suggest that this is something that we can control. It isn’t. It’s not that we like seeming like a complete basket case. But I speak for women everywhere when I say that none of you have any idea what having your period is like. For some of us. it’s excruciatingly painful. Also, it’s not like we have too much of a warning when it’s coming; we don’t. It just shows up. I think if something like that happened to you guys, you would flip out and cry like a baby too. So really, cut us some slack. We suffer for one week out of the month, every month of the year, for years and years of our lives. For lack of a better phrase, it sucks.
We cannot help the craziness. Somewhere deep inside, we know that we shouldn’t act like total nutcases and, chances are, whatever we are yelling at you for, it is superfluous. Do yourself and us ladies a favor, just nod your head and agree with us. Do what you can to keep the peace. You should have a good idea of when our time is coming.
If you don’t, here are a few things to look out for. One, we start to get a tad bit more expressive before the typhoon of emotions floods us. Two, a good number of girls get cravings. For example, the women in my gene pool tend to load up on chocolate, however some prefer salty snacks. I’m sure none of us would be opposed to both.
This brings me to another question: What is the voodoo that surrounds tampons? Why is it such a terrible thing for you, as a male, to go to the store and buy us a box of tampons? What, do you think the cashier is going to think that you have your period? Quite unlikely, gentlemen. Take it from someone whose bought plenty of boxes of tampons, there are worse things in the world. Help us out every now and then.

The Constitution of the United States of America is the basis for all of our laws. It describes certain rights and freedoms that every citizen is entitled to and it establishes some very crucial and irrevocable laws that no one is allowed to break. It sets up our three branches of government. It is also so brilliantly written that it allows current day courts to use it as a basis for all of its decisions, even though it was written over two hundred years ago.  Here is the problem though, of course it is not exactly a new document and it hasn’t quiet caught up to current times yet. It leaves almost too much room for interpretation.
For example, the First Amendment guarantees freedom of press, which was fine back in the late 1700s when newspapers and pamphlets were the only kinds of press that existed. Now we have dozens of kinds of media, including bloggers. The debate whether a blog constitutes a protected form of press is yet to be resolved and a solution doesn’t seem imminent in the near future. Why is it a bit more complicated? It could be because the majority of Congress is made up of representatives who are a bit out of touch with current trends and technologies and who don’t really know what to do or they are too busy arguing to get anything accomplished. It also doesn’t include newer ideas that are debated, like marriage rights, abortion laws, health care, or capital punishment.  But our Constitution has many other issues that need to be addressed.
The wording of our Constitution matches the time period it was written in. That is fine for those who wrote it then, but now it leaves a lot to the mind of the reader. For example, the Second Amendment states, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Is anyone else really confused as to what exactly that says? It could be saying a few things, the first is that a militia within the state can have their own weapons, or that everyone in the state can have their own weapons. It’s one of those things that may never be figured out, especially when the people that would know the answer have been dead for around two hundred years.
So what do we do? Our oldest and possibly most important document is outdated and tough to interpret. To get new amendments added to the Constitution is almost impossible. The law would not only have to be voted and agreed on by a two-thirds vote in Congress, but then three quarters of the states would have to agree that it is a good idea. As we all know, each state has its own population in which each person has their own points of view and its own ideas. Trying to edit and add to the Constitution to update it is just not practical and would probably take decades to accomplish. Perhaps, if Congress could just pass a series of laws that would make some of the questions a bit more clear it would be possible, but even that could take years since they are too busy arguing for party rights and who has seniority over who.
Honestly, the first step is purely about raising awareness. Nothing can get accomplished if no one knows about the issue. So take the initiative and start to raise the awareness. Write a letter to your local representatives, to your senators, and let them know that you want to see changed, that you want them to do their jobs and make our world a better place.

It appears that almost every person has a Facebook account. Some of us may go on it ten times a day where others may check it once or twice daily. However, it seems our daily rituals have changed, or at least it has for me. It used to be waking up, showering, getting ready, etc. This has now changed to waking up and immediately checking my Facebook. While some of you can relate to this, I find myself asking, “Is Facebook an obsession or are we suffering from FAD- Facebook Addiction Disorder, which can feel like being addicted to a drug?”
Well, my curiosity as to why we are so obsessed with Facebook has led me to find out there is an actual disorder called FAD, also known as Facebook Depression Disorder. This disorder explains that people who stay on Facebook for a long period of time a day means they are more unhappy with their lives then people who do not spend as much time on it.
Some of you may agree that as much as we try not to check our Facebook so many times a day, we do anyways because we may not have self- control. When I get a notification; whether it is a wall post, someone tagging me in a photo, and of course having to comment back on my friend’s page, I feel like Facebook is a drug. If I don’t check my Facebook numerous times a day, it’s almost like a withdrawal. Or, if I am online, it is nearly impossible to log out or stop scrolling down the page and basically stalking someone’s Facebook. Then again, maybe your just curious to know what your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend is up to now-days (Oh come on, don’t act like you haven’t done that before).
The worst part of FAD is people who see pictures of their friends going out and smiling think “these people” have better lives from them. First of all, this is not true. In fact, these pictures don’t represent who you really are and obscure reality. So why do we care so much and feel the need to see each picture they just posted and examine everyone?
In my opinion, I feel students are so addicted to Facebook because it is filling a certain void in their lives and it will always be available to connect with others, find out information that you maybe didn’t know, or just a “hobby” to fill your time with. Well, whatever the reason, you may find yourself suffering from what we would like to call the phenomenon of Facebook Depression.

Five weeks ago, a 17-year-old boy was shot in Florida by a 28-year-old neighborhood watchman. In the last few weeks, the case has incited a lot of emotion from many people across the country. Although the Trayvon Martin case is far from the first incident of this nature, it has brought to light a major issue in today’s society: vigilante justice.
In the twenty first century, one has to wonder whether vigilantism really has a place in society. Should the Texas neighbor witnessing what he suspects to be a home invasion across the street really have the right to chase down the suspects and kill them with a shotgun? Should a middle-aged man in a rural neighborhood in upstate New York really walk away scot-free after gunning down a teenager he suspected of recent burglaries in the neighborhood?
Whether we like it or not, these situations are far from uncommon. Florida’s NRA-sponsored “Stand Your Ground” law is just one of many similar self-defense laws around the country that take a liberal stance on the use of deadly force in situations where the defendant claims they believed their life was at risk. However, I believe there should be a clear distinction between the use of deadly force when a person’s life is put in danger and when a person puts his or her own life in danger. Regardless of how threatened George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watchman, may claim he felt, we have to remember that he willingly put himself in that position. The police dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay where he was and to resist the urge to pursue Martin, but Zimmerman ignored the warning and followed the teen instead.
Paige Albano, a freshman at LIU Post believes gun control is at the center of this controversy. According to Msnbc.com, Zimmerman was arrested in 2005 on charges of “resisting officer with violence” and “battery of law enforcement officer.” The charges were later lessened to “resisting officer without violence” and eventually dismissed after Zimmerman entered a program aimed at alcohol education. “I definitely think we should look into tighter gun controls,” Albano said.
In a world of red light cameras and advanced technology, do we really need armed neighborhood crusaders? If, in the next few weeks, we find out that Martin was under the influence of marijuana or was peeping in car windows for unguarded Ipods, which I am, in no way, assuming he was, does it really matter? Is an Ipod or a GPS really worth a 17-year-old’s life? I don’t believe it is. I like my neighbors as much as the next suburbanite, but that doesn’t mean I want them armed and ready to take down anyone they deem “suspicious.”

Some homophobic individuals will say that they feel the way they do because they don’t want someone of the same sex hitting on them. For the most part this is a ridiculous argument, but I have to admit that there are some individuals in the LGBTQ community that believe that they can “turn” heterosexual men and women. If you’re one of these people I’m begging you to PLEASE STOP TRYING!!!
I have heard too many gay men say, “He’s just straight because he hasn’t met me yet” or one of my personal favorites “Straight? So is spaghetti until you heat it up.” However, the argument still stands that you can’t make someone gay or straight. Sexuality is not something that you choose or change therefore you can’t “turn” someone no matter how hard you try.
I’m not going to lie, I have been attracted to my fair share of straight men, but I have never pushed someone to the point where they have felt victimized. Sure, discomfort creeps in when the tension rises between the two of you; he might have even said that he was curious, but when he says no, he means it.
“No means no”, we’ve heard it a million times, but it’s true. If we want people to respect our sexuality, we need to respect theirs. Please, don’t be a predator. The LGBTQ community is under fire everyday from different organizations and religious institutions, why would you want to give them more ammo? Unfortunately, the actions of a few can affect the reputation of many.
Of course there are straight men that we see and think to ourselves “If only…,” but that’s all it is, a thought, a dream. Acting on that desire can seriously hurt someone. A lot of people don’t really think about the repercussions of their actions in situations like this. Someone could be traumatized by such a situation, or they can react with violence when they wake up the next morning.
Everyone deserves respect. We should give them that respect and expect the same amount of respect in return. If someone identifies themselves as straight, who are we to decide that they are anything but straight? We have no right to bet on other peoples sexual identities. Sexual identity is a private matter, if that person chooses to broadcast their private business that is their decision. No one has the right to “out” another person.
At the end of the day, the important thing is to respect the word “no”. No one wants to be forced or coerced into something. How would you feel if someone tricked you into doing something you weren’t comfortable with? Whether or not the person is curious or not, it’s best to let them figure things out on their own. It makes less of a mess.

LIU Post’s own Rafe Tangorra has been busy with his Paging Grace band mates, Chris Trentacoste, Phil Firetog, Bryan Mulholland, and David Wong. The rock band released its first EP, “All You’re Made Of,” in 2007. Its second EP, “Stay The Night,” was released in 2009.
Paging Grace believes that listeners need to have music they can connect with. That’s why the group is named after lead singer Chris Trentacoste’s grandmother. This allows him to reflect on how even after death, his connection with her continues. The band’s song “Take Back Your Freedom” was written about Trent’s mother during her battle with breast cancer.
The first album’s single, “Leave,” hit radio airwaves in January 2008. Statistically, it was well received in the Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York markets. The band was awarded “Hot AC Most Added New Artist” and reached #1 on the “Independent Music Network,” was voted Best Band by the Long Island Press in 2008 and 2009, was featured on MTV’s true life, and is listed as the Top 10 artist in New York by Myspace and Top 3 by AOL City Guide.
For the Paging Grace Care’s Campaign, Rafe Tangorra, drummer, co-founded Rock Out Autism in 2008. The Benefit Concert has raised over $37,000 for The Fay J. Lindner Center, which provides services for those living with autism. Rock Out Autism 2012 will be held on April 28th, 2012, at The Nutty Irishman, 323 Main Street, Farmingdale, N.Y. Tickets are $10 in advance and $15 at the door. This year’s show will feature Paging Grace, Nick Tangorra, The Walking Tree, Homebound, Trish Torrales, and the #1 New York Foreigner Tribute, Head Games.
My personal favorites include, “Don’t Rush Me” and “Every Inch of You.” The band’s music certainly does belong on the radio, with an upbeat melody and lyrics that come straight from the heart. It certainly gives bands, such as Daughtry, a run for their money and has been off to an impressive start. “All You’re Made Of” and “Stay The Night” are available to download via iTunes. Tune into PTV Channel 96, LIU Post’s TV Station, on Sunday, April 15th, for an exclusive performance and interview with Paging Grace along with an interview with New York State Senator Charles J. Fuschillo. Proceeds collected from the special will benefit the Interfaith Nutrition Network, a network of soup kitchens to feed hungry Long Islanders.

Known as the “Dead Center of the Kingdom,” the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, is one of the most splendid and affluent cities in the modern world, sprawling across about 600 square miles of desert in the heart of the Arabian Peninsula. Riyadh is a true oasis in the Saudi Arabian desert, brimming with culture, history, exquisite architecture, and an exotic feel of opulence that is bound to enchant just about any visitor. Modern Riyadh has retained its ancient heritage, and business travelers can revel in the many shopping and sightseeing opportunities this city has to offer. Modern it may be, but visitors to Riyadh are never likely to forget that they are in the heart of the Arab world; in between the towering, futuristic buildings, glitzy shopping malls, and sweeping highways are nestled ancient mosques and other remnants of times gone by. The city is also run on a strictly-Islamic moral and cultural code. Visitors should respect the rules while exploring the sights, both ancient and modern.
Airlines: Since Riyadh is in the heart of the Arabian Kingdom, accessibility is highly convenient to this luxurious capital. Whether flying from an international destination or traveling within the Kingdom, a vast majority of visitors to Riyadh arrive at King Khaled International Airport (KKIA). If traveling from the U.S, Saudi Arabian Airlines offers a direct flight to KKIA Airport. Other airlines that are popular to the Saudi Arabian capital are Lufthansa, Emirates and Turkish Airlines.
Attractions/Sightseeing: Sightseeing in Riyadh includes checking out the numerous parks, gardens, castles, palaces, museums, and other fabulous structures and places that not only adorn the city but also speak volumes about the heritage, culture, and history. One of the most famous sightseeing destinations in Riyadh is the Al-Thumama Entertainment Village. Extremely popular among the children, the entertainment center offers a wide range of games and activities for both the young and the old. This is more of an amusement park. You can go on bumper cars or check out food stalls that sell traditional Arabian dishes. Travelers can also pay a visit to the Al Musmak Castle. This castle is a symbol of the history of Riyadh. Built during the reign of Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Rasheed, the Castle is known for its marvelous watchtowers and the huge Castle Gate. Furthermore, Riyadh is home to a large number of modern architectural marvels and buildings. Sightseeing is almost incomplete without checking out structures like the Kingdom Center. This is one of the tallest buildings of the city. The building is shaped like a bottle opener and is home to a large number of offices, shopping malls, and hotels. It is a fine example of modern architecture. Finally, check out the exquisite Salam Park, which represents some of the natural elements for Riyadh City Center in Qasr Al Hokm area (Rule Palace). This historical site and heritage center witnessed the start of the modern Saudi State. A popular destination near the city includes Jeddah, which is the main gateway to holy city of Mecca.
Cuisine: Riyadh offers the highest quality dining experience in the kingdom with restaurants that are located high up in skyscrapers to local desert-bound locations. Enjoy local Najdi cuisine, which is the most traditional meal in the city. The Yemeni dish, Mandi, is also a popular meal, particularly at lunchtime. Fast food is also popular with several multinational chains, such as Saraya Restaurant, specializing in the brilliant Middle Eastern and North African cuisine, and Alrayan Restaurant, which is famous for offering guests the opportunity to sample authentic Arabian and Middle Eastern cuisine. The place specializes in hummus and mutabal. People visiting in Riyadh can also enjoy the diversity of international cuisine at the modern malls, hotels, and restaurants.

The art exhibit in the Hillwood Gallery on March 28th, Color Blind by Denae Howard, was very powerful and left me thinking about things in a different way. In the display, senior and Fine Arts/Mixed Studio major Denae Howard took some very famous people and turned them into a different race. Color Blind is a play on the idea of a world composed solely of black people.
As Howard was growing up, she found herself wondering why black or African cultures were secondary to the white or European norm. Howard took popular American icons and changed the color of their skin. By displaying the idea of an all black society, Howard forced the viewers to see themselves as another race.
Howard’s display featured images, such as John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, and Justin Timberlake, depicted as black. Howard also put up two mirrors that were only large enough to view one’s face. The mirrors are sepia-toned brown, and as each person looked into the mirror, they saw themselves as another race.
“In terms of the project, I want people to take away the ideology of race dominances and familiarity,” said Howard. “Though people speak of diversity, I believe there will always be an unspoken notion of dominance because of race, class and gender; but I would also want the viewer to question my work and question themselves. For instance, how does my concept or idea affect you, the viewer?” She wanted to provoke her viewers through discomfort and uncertainty, which would ignite conversation. Howard explained, “I would like the viewer to live temporarily in this all black world that I have created.”
Ara McPherson, a junior Sociology major, spoke about her favorite piece and its impact.  “She took a spin on iconic faces. It’s a view point as to what it would be like if we were all one color. My favorite piece is the Marilyn Monroe piece because a lot of women, no matter what color, shape or size, look up to her because she was so comfortable with who she was. I think it holds a huge message, depicting her as black.”
Other students explained how the exhibit was like nothing they had ever seen before. “I think it’s different, very unique, and cultural,” explained Miguel Murillo, a senior Finance major. “This is awesome; it’s a different way to see yourself.  This is definitely inspirational. Being Hispanic, I actually appreciate it a lot because she is representing her background to the fullest.”
“It’s very unusual; I’ve never seen something like this,” said Nancy Kaur, a freshman Business major. “It goes past just one side of art.”
I loved the exhibit and the message behind it. I found myself questioning a lot of things within society and the norms it challenges. Howard’s exhibit really impacted me, and it also impacted many others. It began to make me think a lot about what is considered normal, beautiful and powerful.  I really feel as though I was seeing things through the eyes of the artist. I completely understand the message Howard was trying to send when I looked at myself in the sepia-brown mirror. Howard’s work is very inspiring, and I am eager to see what mark she will leave on society in the future.

Most college students usually reserve dancing for the club scene, but this is not true in all cases. About a month ago, I discovered the Ballroom Dancing Club at LIU Post. It caught my interest, and I thought it would be nice to learn some appropriate dances for formal occasions. I attended a meeting few weeks ago and brought my boyfriend along for the ride.
The meeting was in Hillwood Commons, which I never knew had a dance floor. Before we walked in, the room was in favor of females about twenty to one. At least we slightly helped the score. The girl instructing the class, Alize France Margulis, a sophomore International Business major, was very excited to see new faces. She welcomed us with open arms. Marguilis explained that each meeting focuses on teaching a different type of dance and that salsa would be on today’s agenda. Salsa dancing always looked very appealing and graceful to me, so I was eager to learn.
Luckily, Margulis was just as thrilled to teach, as some of those moves can be tricky. If anyone was having trouble, she would come to the rescue immediately. She showed them personally, one on one, so there was no confusion. Mastering salsa requires a lot of fancy footwork and shaking your hips like Shakira. I think I got the hang of it, just not in full speed.
The class started off with beginner steps, slowly and without music, and then gradually progressed by moving to the rhythm at the speed of the original beat. At first, everyone started off alone, participating as a class to intro steps for the day’s theme. For salsa, we stepped twice to the front, twice to the back while moving our hips and arms. This can also be done left to right. These steps help advance you to more complicated moves, which are required when dancing to an actual song.
In the next part, everyone danced in pairs, learning how to use the steps we just learned while working with a partner. This step ended with a turn and a spin. That was my favorite part! I was thrilled to learn this sophisticated move on the dance floor. It felt exhilarating to be effortlessly turned and gracefully spun around. I will definitely be back again for more!
To my surprise, I think my boyfriend enjoyed the experience more than I did! This club can truly give one confidence on the dance floor! After one lesson, he now leads and turns me with complete grace and ease.
I enjoyed the club because it was a huge stress reliever and was simply a lot of fun. It changed my view on ballroom dancing. I used to think that ballroom dancing was very strict and serious, but the club was not like that at all. It was laid back, exciting, and free.
If you want to experience the club for yourself, come to a meeting. The Ballroom Dancing Club meets every Thursday on the third floor of Hillwood Commons from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. Come shake up your lunch hour!

The LIU Post baseball team has won six consecutive games to catapult it above the .500 mark with a record of 13-10. The Pioneers swept a double-header against Queens College on March 24th, and the following day, the Pioneers beat Queens again by a score of 2-1. Later in the week, the Pioneers won both of their out-of-conference games, as they knocked off Dominican College 5-4 and defeated Caldwell College 5-2. LIU remained perfect in East Coast Conference play when it cruised to an 11-6 victory over Mercy College.
In the game on the road against Dominican on March 27th, Pioneers’ freshman starting pitcher Joey Arena went seven strong innings, allowing two runs and striking out seven batters, but did not get enough run support to qualify for a win. Although junior pitcher Kevin Chenicek allowed two runs in relief, he picked up the win, and junior pitcher Anthony Zapulla picked up his second save of the season.
The Pioneers started the game by scoring three runs in the first inning with three different players driving in runs. Sophomore centerfielder Rich Maccarone, junior right fielder Gabriel Santos, and freshman third baseman Anthony Brunetti all had RBIs to help the Pioneers jump to an early 3-0 lead.
The Pioneers controlled the game until the eighth inning, when the Chargers tied it up with two runs in the inning to make it a 4-4 game. In the ninth inning, the Pioneers scratched out a run to break the tie, as Maccarone hit a sacrifice fly to drive in junior second baseman Angel Pimentel.
The Pioneers continued their hot stretch at home two days later when they beat Caldwell College 5-2 behind the solid pitching efforts of senior Glen Hudson and junior Rafael Martinez. Hudson went five innings while striking out nine batters for his first win of the campaign, while Martinez garnered his first save, going the final four innings and allowing only one hit in relief.
The big hit in the game came in the third inning when the Pioneers were trailing 1-0. Senior catcher Matt Simone cleared the bases with a three-run triple, giving the Pioneers a 3-1 lead. Pimentel gave LIU an insurance run in the sixth inning with an RBI double, and the Pioneers did not look back.
In their next game on Friday, March 30th, the Pioneers had an offensive explosion, scoring 11 runs on 14 hits as they defeated ECC rival Mercy College. Sophomore pitcher Mike Eckerle notched his second win of the season as he went two innings of scoreless relief. The Pioneers had big games from several players at the plate, including Pimentel, who went 3-6 and drove in five runs. Maccarone continued his clutch hitting, as he went 3-5 from the dish and crossed the plate three times. Also, sophomore outfielder Vincent Iacono was perfect at the plate, going 3-3 while driving in three runs.
The Pioneers’ next game is an ECC battle on the road against Molloy College (8-15) on Wednesday, April 4th, at 3:00 p.m.

The LIU Post men’s lacrosse team dropped its third straight game, as it fell 8-5 to number one ranked Mercyhurst College on Saturday.
The loss moves the Pioneers to 3-4 on the season and 1-4 in conference play.
Senior attacker Eddie Plompen led the Pioneers with three goals in the contest. Senior attacker Doug Hoch and freshman midfielder Connor Drost also scored for the Pioneers in the loss.
Drost opened up the scoring in the first quarter at the 10:43 mark. The Mercyhurst Lakers answered back at 4:11, when senior attacker Kyle Kallay ripped one past freshman goalkeeper Sam Price. The Lakers took the lead off a goal from junior midfielder Mark Saltrelli with 3:08 left in the quarter. Junior midfielder Zac Reid then made it 3-1 in favor of the Lakers with six seconds left in the quarter.
The Pioneers kept the Lakers off the board in the second quarter until junior attacker Brian Scheetz scored at 6:08.
Plompen led the charge back for the Pioneers, netting back-to-back goals at 5:10 and 4:04 to cut the Lakers’ lead to 4-3. Hoch tied the game up at four with 39 seconds left in the first half.
The Lakers regained the lead when Scheetz found the back of the net for the second time of the game. But Eddie Plompen answered back at 7:36, tying the game at five and scoring his third goal of the game.
Just over four minutes later, Mercyhurst took back the lead.  At 3:48, Kallay scored off a pass from sophomore attacker Jake Mcandrew.  Kallay would add another goal in the fourth quarter off the opening face-off.
The Lakers added a final goal with 1:08 left to play in the game, when sophomore midfielder Matt Hummel scored with Mercyhurst on the man advantage.
Price made seven stops in goal for the Pioneers, and Lakers’ sophomore goalkeeper Michael Grace made four stops during the game. The Pioneers were outshot 34-17 but held a 23-22 advantage on ground balls.
The Pioneers will look to snap their losing streak when they travel to Ohio on Saturday, April 7th, to take on Lake Erie College at 1:00 p.m.

The LIU Post women’s lacrosse team flexed its scoring muscle on Sunday, April 1st, defeating Lake Erie College by a score of 23-5 at home on Hickox Field. Five Pioneers recorded hat tricks in the game that improved Post’s record to 6-1 while dropping Lake Erie to 4-4.
Just five minutes into the game, the Pioneers were ahead 7-0 with the help of three goals from junior Ashley Olen. The Lake Erie Storm was held scoreless until the 19:05 minute mark, when Meredith Howe found the back of the net for the first point on the visitor side of the board.
Post quickly regained the momentum from there, scoring another seven goals, one of which came from junior attacker BriAnn DeLutri with just one second left in the first half, to bring the score to 14-1 at the half.
The Pioneers continued to dominate on offense into the second half. Sophomore attacker Jackie Sileo and sophomore midfielder Kathleen Rotan each scored before the Storm was able to finish for their goal of the game with 22 minutes left in play.
The home team quickly added another three goals, two from sophomore Samantha Losco and one from junior Megan Noone, before Lake Erie scored their third goal of the day.
DiLutri ended the contest for the Pioneers with her second goal of the day with seven seconds left to play to round out the score at 23-5.
Olen, Sileo, Rotan, Losco, and senior Lauren Spagnoletta each finished the day with a hat trick, while Sileo and freshman Alexis Newman added three assists apiece.
The Pioneers take the field again Wednesday, April 4th, in Queens at 3:30 p.m. when they take on the 5-1 Knights of Queens College.
