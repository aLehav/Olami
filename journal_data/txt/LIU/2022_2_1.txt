Disappointed at the lack of variety in opportunities on campus for non-music majors to have fun making music, sophomore music education major Ally Perticone and junior music education major Annie Rodriguez took matters into their own hands and established Post’s first a cappella group named “Sharks & Flats” as co-leaders. 
“[…] The school didn’t have an a cappella group so we wanted to create one for a different vibe for making music,” Perticone said.
A cappella–derived from Italian meaning “in the style of the chapel”–is a musical performance by a singer or group without instruments. 
There are currently 90 collegiate a cappella groups in the United States–the earliest being established in 1873. In recent times, this style has been popularized by the extremely commercially successful “Pitch Perfect” franchise (that sold $565 million at the box office) introducing it to a wider audience. 
The most commercially successful a cappella group is Pentatonix–originally from Arlington, Texas, they have over 5 billion views on YouTube and have won 3 GRAMMYs thus helping bring the a cappella style more into the mainstream.
Since its inception last semester, “Sharks & Flats” is swiftly growing, currently having 21 members. To become a member of the club, students must go through a two-step audition process.
“We hold an audition process where they sing any song and site read music on the spot,” Perticone said.
Anyone looking to join the club must have prior experience working with and making music as the group has every intention to compete in the future. The biggest collegiate a cappella competition is the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) in which hundreds of collegiate a cappella groups from all over the world compete. Groups are judged not only on vocal performance but visual performance as well.
“You should have a good amount of experience and background. The group is very serious and we are looking to compete,” Perticone said.
Joining this club would be a beneficial and enriching experience for any student interested in music. 
“It’s a fun music making experience and it’s nice to be around people who are passionate and empathetic and caring. A lot of musical theatre majors can’t join chorus or choir due to their schedule so it’s a nice opportunity for them to get to make music,” Rodriguez said.
The group meets every Tuesday from 8:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in the music rehearsal room. For further inquiries, students may contact Rodriguez and Perticone at @liu.acappella on Instagram.

LIU Women’s Gymnastics opened their season at the Pratt Recreation Center against Yale University on Sunday, Jan. 23. This was not only the team’s first home meet of the year, but was also the first Women’s Gymnastics meet to ever have fans in attendance, as COVID-19 restrictions limited fan attendance during the inaugural 2020-2021 season.
Coming into the first home meet of the season, the Women’s Gymnastics team was looking to get their first win in program history, as they had an 0-12 record during the 2020-2021 season. 
With fans in the stands for the first time, the Sharks felt the pressure early on, scoring a 48.075 in their first event, Vault. Following this underwhelming start, junior business major Amanda Loo says the team had to come together and get on the same page.
“Vault was our first event and we got a 48, but it was not our best lineup,” she said. “So, we had to circle up and ask ourselves, do we really want this? And we all agreed to fight to the end.”
Following the slow start, the Sharks got back on track thanks to an outstanding performance by sophomore international relations major Mara Titarsolej, who scored a 9.90 on the uneven bars, which was the highest score for that event. 
For Titarsolej, she believes that her team’s comeback was one that was rooted in their hard work during the offseason. 
“We had a much better preseason than last year. We spent a lot more time together and we know each other better in what we need,” she said. “We learned to trust each other and the process of training and getting better.”
Fueled by the near-perfect performance by Titarsolej, LIU went on to score a school record 48.700 on bars, which got them right back on track. 
The Sharks carried this momentum into their next event, Beam, as they scored a 48.600, which tied them with Yale at a running score of 145.375 heading into the final event of the meet. 
With an opportunity to capture their first ever win in program history, LIU came up big in their final event, Floor. Led by the outstanding performance of Amanda Loo, who scored a 9.800, the Women’s Gymnastics team captured their first ever victory in program history, beating Yale by a score of 194.200-193.875. 
Loo believes that having fans in the stands was a key factor to pushing the Sharks over the top.  
“Being in front of the home crowd really amped us up. It was exciting especially for all of the freshmen because last year we did not have fans in the stands so having that back was exhilarating,” she said. “Being able to perform and looking at all of my friends, family, people from my home gym, and my coach who never saw me do college gymnastics before made it really exciting for me.” 
LIU’s head coach Randy Lane also felt the impact of having fans for the first time. 
“I would have to say that the student section was pretty awesome,” he said. “When they saw the girls tumbling, I think their reactions to just our team doing gymnastics was really great to see. That makes me happy when we can make students and just people in general have pride in what we’re doing. I think they become a part of our family as well. So that was definitely a highlight for me.”
The Shark’s victory marked the first ever for Coach Lane as the head coach of this program. For him, it is much more than just one win. 
“I take great pride in the fact that these women have come together so quickly at LIU. I find that hard work pays off and they have been working extremely hard,” he said. “For me, it’s not so much about the win, it’s literally about the culture that we’re building here and the legacy that this first team is leaving when they graduate… I think that more than anything, just seeing their faces and their goals being met was enough to make me happy as the head coach winning for the first time.”
Titarsolej believes that this was a statement win for the up and coming program.
“It felt really good to win. We all knew we were capable of scoring a 194, and we proved it yesterday,” she said. “It was really great to show off in front of our fans and everyone who came.”
Despite scoring a program record in their last meet, Coach Lane believes that his team is capable of even more as the season progresses. 
“We have set a goal for us, scoring as a team, a 196. That is like a really big benchmark, especially for a new program to even reach that. I got many text messages and phone calls yesterday after our meet about people saying, ‘oh my gosh, you made it to the 194 mark.’ I’m like, yes, and we’re not done,” he said. “Hopefully we will continue to progress like we have been over the last three meets, as we scored a 190.8 in our first meet and to score a 194 in really just two weeks time, it ‘s exponential growth. So I’m hoping that they will keep growing, not only in the score, but also as a team and to continue to work on the small details.”
Sharing her coach’s ambition, Loo thinks that her team has the potential to continue to grow. 
“I am looking forward to continuing to add points to our overall scoring each meet, as that has been happening and we have the talent to continue to do so,” she said. “I am definitely looking forward to our team being more comfortable putting on a show and being more confident in everything we do.”
The Women’s Gymnastics team will look to continue their winning ways when they travel to Towson University on Friday, Feb. 4.

Post is full of faculty members who come from all walks of life. Professors come here for many different reasons, and have done many things throughout their careers. Jean Carlomusto is one of those professors.
Carlomusto graduated from Post with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in film in 1981, and is currently one of only a few full time professors in the communications and film department. She teaches mostly broadcasting classes centered around both studio and field television production, as well as editing.
However, Carlomusto has much more to show the world from her career.
“I am a filmmaker, that’s what I do. I also teach. I think there is an interrelationship there,” Carlomusto said. “I have been teaching filmmaking since I was an undergraduate here at LIU Post many years ago. I was a film major, and during the summers I would teach filmmaking to kids in camp. There’s always been that component to what I do and I think there’s a relationship between the energy that I feel from my students who want to make films and figuring out what they want to do and my own practice of exploring what kind of films I want to make.”
Carlomusto began her career as a filmmaker while attending school at Post, however, her work changed when she earned her bachelor’s degree.
“I started out as a more experimental filmmaker, and when I got out of school with my undergraduate degree as a film major from post, I found myself in New York City at the height of the AIDS crisis. I started getting involved with trying to do something about that, and I wanted to do something about it so badly because the mainstream media was botching it up so badly. It took the mainstream media and the government a long time to acknowledge that AIDS was a real crisis that needed to be addressed, so my film practice at that time was very much an activist practice. Desktop video had come out, and portable cameras were everywhere, so I was making these videos about a movement and making documentaries about the AIDS activist movement,” she said, speaking of her earlier work.
Carlomusto says that she believes these documentaries, as well as the AIDS activism movement as a whole, had a large effect around the world.
“This went on to change the world. AIDS activism did have a big impact in not just the United States, but globally,” Carlomusto said. “We helped speed up the way drugs are researched. We came up with innovative models because we could think of more community based interventions.”
Carlomusto also related this period to current day and spoke about Dr. Anthony Fauci and his part in AIDS treatment.
“This is one of the reasons I really admire Dr. Tony Fauci. A lot of people think he’s the devil right now, but as an activist I saw during the AIDS crisis that Tony Fauci was willing to sit down and listen to the people that were protesting outside of his office and he was able to collaborate with the activists. The activists came in with this innovative idea for parallel track drug testing that would speed the process up, and he said ‘Yeah. That’s a great idea. Let’s do it,” so I bring that story up to say that I think he’s a pretty great guy, but also to show that AIDS activism had a really big impact,” she said.
Carlomusto relates this activism to her filmmaking during that time, discussing how films like hers shed light on the depth of the AIDS crisis. She goes on to explain how her work evolved from that point on.
“The early part of my filmmaking career was really tied into that, and I continued to make documentaries about sexuality and gender. I actually did a piece for HBO called Larry Kramer in Love & Anger that documented the life of Larry Kramer, who was really the inspiration behind the AIDS activist movement. He was the primary one. We went to Sundance with that, and it is still available on demand at HBO. I continue my practice to the current day of making documentaries about all different types of things,” she said.
Carlomusto still has a desire to continue her work, and expand into other things.
“I like to think that I could also, maybe one day, have flexibility to do other types of things. I just like filmmaking in general. The current project I’m working on is about a teacher and an anthropologist who is a pioneer in that way,” she said.
Carlomusto looks back on who she calls pioneers from past generations, who stood up for LGBT rights, when thinking about pioneers of the AIDS activist movement.
“There were whole groups of activists from the 1970’s. There were people in the 1960’s and 1950’s too, but less because it was impossible. Homosexuality was outlawed, so people who had to form their lives in this atmosphere, and they still managed to rebel, they are pioneers,” she said.
When looking back on all she’s done, Carlomusto knows what brought her back to teaching here at Post. She worked with her senior advisor, Susan Zeig, who is currently the chairperson of the communications and film department.
“I have long-time friendships with the professors who I had here. That was something that is a gift. So Susan, who had been my senior advisor, kept in touch. She started offering me to come back and teach a course here and there,” she said.
It was this opportunity to teach at Post that gave her an outlet to work with students on their projects.
“I’ve always enjoyed teaching. I love the energy of people who are doing things in the beginning of their career. I enjoy teaching. I have been teaching for almost 30 years, and the great thing for me is that it’s really allowed me to both have time where I’m very much engaged with my students, and to have time where I’m very much engaged with my work,” Carlomusto said. “Those are two very valuable cross-pollinations. That’s really why I’m here. The job allowed me to make films. Teaching gave me a choice, it let me choose what my work would be.”

Almost two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, artists from Broadway to Hollywood are struggling to stay creative while also following health and safety protocols.
During the winter holiday season, Broadway shows were forced to halt performances for weeks at a time when members of casts and crews came down with the virus.
Other Broadway shows such as “Jagged Little Pill” and “Mean Girls” abruptly announced their closing dates around this time. This came as a shock to many fans as these musicals carried a strong fan base.
Movie theaters across the country are struggling to fill up seats, and rely heavily on sizable blockbusters such as the recent hit “Spider-Man: No Way Home.”
Relying on hits is a gamble movie theaters cannot risk. The recent release of Steven Spielberg’s West “Side Story” remake was set to do great numbers at the box office, but fell gravely short. Critics suspect a mixture of lack of marketing and being overshadowed by the Spider-Man franchise was to blame. 
Some audience members do not feel comfortable enough to return to in person viewings yet. Others are ecstatic that venues are open, only to be canceled when cast and crew members test positive for COVID-19.
Though this is a time of great struggle in the artistic world, it is also a time to create new art, and get creative in the way performers deliver their work.
Theatre students on campus are excited to be back in the audience for Broadway shows. Especially when they are soon to graduate into the world of professional theatre.
“It was really nice to be in that atmosphere again, even though we had to wear masks it didn’t really make much of a difference, it just felt nice to be back in a theater,” senior musical theater major Lauren Arnold said.
Arnold has recently seen Broadway productions of “Moulin Rouge” and “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.” 
“It did feel safe, one of the shows I saw, Harry Potter, was a completely sold out audience, so we were all brought into the theater before the show actually started and were all mingling around,” Arnold said.
Arnold agrees that even though she felt safe in these circumstances, she could see how someone else might feel uncomfortable.
“With all of the vaccinations and boosters that we have now, you can come at your own discretion,” Arnold said.
All ticket holders attending Broadway shows are required to provide proof of vaccination, in addition to wearing a mask throughout the duration of the performance.
For movie theaters, the CDC recommends masks and social distancing. Vaccination guidelines vary based on state and local guidelines. 
For now, guests can still enjoy popcorn while watching their feature. 
“I haven’t been to the movie theaters in a very long time because of the pandemic. We were in reclining chairs, the sound was surrounding us, it was really cool,” senior musical theatre major Devin Butera said.
Butera recently saw the movie everyone has been talking about, “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” 
“I love the movie theater because it brings me a very peaceful quaint vibe. I love sitting at the top. I think it’s fun to have a choice of seating. It’s fun to go and buy popcorn, candy and slushies before a movie,” Butera said.
Butera acknowledges the fact that he could watch anything he wanted from the comfort of his own home, but there is something pulling him towards the theaters.
“I know you can just stay at home and get all of your favorite snacks and sit in your bed and watch a movie but it’s also like, if it’s something you really love, an actor you really like, there’s something about going to see them on the big screen that makes it really exciting,” Butera said.
Butera and Arnold are both artists, and recognize the effort and talent that goes into each individual performance they both saw. 
Butera believes that the pandemic is no match for people’s love for art.
“Art will never die as long as people are alive. Everything is art, nature is art. People are the ones that are the perpetrators of artistic views. Everybody is always creating something, everybody is an artist in what they do. Doctors are artists, pilots are artists,” Butera said.
Arnold agrees, and recognizes the opportunities the pandemic has created for artists.
“Covid has kind of jet-setted our digital age. We have kind of been heading towards that, but covid just punched it in, so I think a lot more will be online artistically. My hope is that more original works will come out of this hard time,” Arnold said.
Broadway, Hollywood, and every theater in between has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and artists such as Butera and Arnold will continue to recognize their resilience and drive.

Interest and enthusiasm in crystals was first included in Roman history around 50 A.D. when Pliny the Elder described stones’ origins and physical properties in ancient writings. The word “crystal” comes from the Greek term krystallos, which means “coldness drawn together”.
In the Middle Ages, people thought that crystals would bring a spiritual presence into their lives. People yearned to have something that physically represented faith and spirituality. Ancient Egyptians used crystals for protection and health, as well as cosmetically.
Many different religions use crystals in different ways. Buddhist and Hindu beliefs and practices often use crystals as healing tools. In Western Christianity, crystal was often mentioned in writings and used to decorate important religious objects, as it was believed that crystal manifested transcendence. For the religious, crystal symbolizes purity, faith and perfection. It was often used to describe the purity of the Virgin Mary.
Individuals use crystals differently. Some just see crystals as beautiful pieces for jewelry, while others believe that holding crystals or positioning them on various areas of the body can give physical and mental benefits. The idea is that crystals interact with the body’s energy, creating a balance and alignment, known as chakra.
Many people use crystals for stress and focus, while others believe that crystals have the power to heal injuries and illnesses.
Sophomore international business relations major Emma Thibodeau has been collecting crystals since she was 12 years old.
“My mom started buying them to make necklaces and she would explain to me the meanings, and at first I didn’t understand the hype but after a little bit of time I started to realize that they were pretty cool so I started collecting my own,” she said. “They’re a cool thing to collect. Even if you don’t believe in their healing powers, they’re just pretty as decorations too. But if you do believe in their power to heal, that’s just another reason why somebody would want them.”
Thibodeau, like many other students at Post, is fascinated by the effects that crystals have on many individuals.
“Each crystal has its own energy. They come naturally from the Earth, and I believe everything in nature has its own energy so of course crystals do too,” she said. “There’s no science behind it, but if you hold a charged/cleansed crystal you just automatically feel better.”
While crystals have had a large following for some time, they have become even more popular during the pandemic, especially on the app TikTok. 
“From what I’ve heard, it’s very easy to go viral on TikTok,” junior health science major Miranda Ruiz said. “Content creators lately have been blowing up because of TikTok. Information spreads so quickly now. It makes sense that crystals became a trend on TikTok. Recently, astrology and witchcraft have become popular. Especially with women between their teens and early twenties that use TikTok. I could see crystal-use blowing up on TikTok.” 
Thibodeau thinks that people collect crystals due to how aesthetically pleasing they are, and because of the history of using crystals to heal.
“They’re a cool thing to collect,” Thibodeau said. “Even if you don’t believe in their healing powers, they’re just pretty as decorations too. But if you do believe in their power to heal, that’s just another reason why somebody would want them.”
Different crystals are said by users to have different abilities: quartz stimulates brain function, tiger eye increases awareness, pyrite wards off danger, rose quartz opens the heart.
“I like malachite because it’s cool looking and it’s supposed to be good for travelers, which I love to do,” Thibodeau said.
Ruiz loves amethyst because it removes negative energy.
A study by University of London psychologist Dr. Chris French debunked the attributes of crystals in a study in 2001. In the study, he gave crystals to 80 volunteers, as well as an informational booklet about their supposed restorative properties. A control group that consisted of half the study participants had been given cheap plastic crystals, while the other half were given genuine ones. Both groups reported feeling the tingling, energy-enhancing sensations that were promised in the booklet, emphasizing the placebo effect.
Despite the research contradicting the effects of crystals, Thibodeau believes that crystals can help people.
“If you’re having a bad day, it’s nice to just look at or hold your crystals and you automatically feel better. Some people use them for physical pain such as headaches, which I’ve also tried before. But overall, they help me to feel more positive and at peace with life,” she said. “They’re a great thing to get into. Everybody should keep a crystal or two around to help cleanse your space.”

As residents prepared to move onto the Post campus for the spring semester, multiple emails from administrative officials shocked students.
“I received the message four days before my move-in day, and I didn’t think that was timely at all,” sophomore writing and theatre arts major Ejay Pegg said. “I was really mad … I was immediately trying to contact the school to understand why they would tell us so late.”
Despite having COVID-19 rapid tests on campus, the university did not tell many students that were struggling to get a test for move-in.
“I emailed a few people at school …. And they didn’t get back to me until the day of move-in, and they told me that COVID tests are being offered on campus,” Pegg said. “I don’t know why that wasn’t public information.”
Sophomore criminal justice and forensic science major Anabel Barlow asked school officials for help, and was not informed that the Center for Healthy Living on campus would be able to administer a COVID-19 test.
“I arrived early on Jan. 14, and I was only notified [that I needed the negative test] two days before. I told the school that there was no chance of me getting a test because I was in California,” Barlow said. “Rapid test [appointments] in urgent care were completely filled up. Walgreens and CVS spots were booked until the 20th. So, I emailed and called the school to say there was nothing I could do [to get the test]… the school said to just try and get one. Then, the day I got on the plane, Trey [the resident director for Post residence hall] said that I could spend the night in my dorm and then go straight to an urgent care the next morning and get a rapid test. It was a whole mess, and I had to pay $30 for the Lyft to get there and back.”
Some students did not know whether Post had a plan for students who tested positive for COVID-19 this semester.
“I didn’t know if I was going to be able to come [to campus], and I had a plane ticket,” Barlow said. “I couldn’t get a refund, my plane had already been delayed and switched because of COVID. And coming from across the country, I don’t have friends or family here. There’s nothing else I can do, but come to the school [to live]. So, if they didn’t have anything lined up for me, I would’ve been homeless.” 
While it was a struggle for many residents to get an appointment with only a few days notice, the move in process was reported to be typical by students. Resident Assistants (RAs) greeted residents at the front of their building as they arrived, and asked for proof of a negative COVID-19 test and vaccination card before giving students clearance to enter their hall. However, some students at Post hall entered without the knowledge of the RAs, potentially exposing other residents to COVID-19.
“Someone in the dorm had a family member in public safety that let them in without any tests at all,” Barlow said. “They bypassed the RAs completely, had their room code and got in. The RAs didn’t know they were in the dorm until hours later. [They] didn’t know what their COVID status was, either.”
A student that will remain anonymous reported that they felt unsafe moving in when another student entered their dorm before receiving their rapid test results. The student then received positive test results for COVID-19.
“Upon my roommate and I moving in, one of our friends came to visit us in our dorm. At the time, I assumed [our friend] had received his COVID-19 test result because he was allowed in the dorm. He hugged me when he came in, and was in the room for about 10 minutes. He told us that he was still waiting for the results, and then abruptly left after getting a phone call from the Center for Healthy Living (CFHL) with a positive result. My main concern is why would someone be allowed into the building when they had not yet received a COVID test result? I felt nervous and anxious for myself and my roommate because we might have been exposed.
 I didn’t know if I would expose my peers and classmates, so for the remainder of the day, my roommate and I wore our masks everywhere, sanitized our room and did not leave our building. My roommate called the COVID-19 hotline and the Center for Healthy Living. The CFHL did not answer, so we reported what happened to two RAs and explained the situation to Trey Pogue, our resident director. Trey Pogue told us that he was not too stressed about the situation because we are vaccinated and to monitor for symptoms. We did not have to quarantine.”
Students were not notified of these occurrences by the university, and were irritated by the possible exposure.
“It’s so hypocritical because [the university] is acting like they are taking all these measures, and then you find out that they’re really not enforcing it much,” Pegg said. 
While some students felt stressed moving in and starting classes amid these delayed emails, Berthel’s message assured students that Post is ready to prepare students to again be in-person this semester. 
“We are equipped with a high vaccination and booster rate, a steadfast commitment to following safety protocols, and an individual pledge to protect each other and our University community. Together, we look forward to a successful and safe spring 2022 semester,” Berthel said.
However, students feel that response from university officials is not enough to address the lack of communication.
“I feel like there was no consideration for people who live in areas that don’t have access to testing, or people who can’t get access in that timeframe,” Pegg said. “I feel like even when [students] complain, it feels like it gets brushed off a lot. It feels less like a learning environment and more like a business … I really don’t feel like the school prioritizes every student. I think they value the students that can give them either money or something they consider valuable, like an athletic skill.”
Chief Operating Officer Joe Schaefer and VP for Student Affairs Michael Berthel were reached out to for comment, but have yet to respond. This story is ongoing.

Since Fall 2021, Senior Business Administration major Robert LaPollo has been president of SGA and is leading the way for all the achievements made under the organization. LaPollo has had many proud moments over his time in the program. 
“One is bringing the program back because, like many other organizations, COVID didn’t help. Our presence on campus wasn’t as strong last year, and it was my goal to bring the name back to the organization,” he said. “Allow people to know that SGA is here for you. We’re providing for the student body and we’re doing things that can better their LIU experience”. 
According to LaPollo, working with administration has been pivotal to working on behalf of the students. Last fall, one of SGA’s major early accomplishments was getting the students back in the gyms. They pressured administration to get it done quickly, and they succeeded in getting them reopened.
 “We have a fantastic relationship with [the] administration right now. In the past, it wasn’t always that way. SGA wasn’t as involved with administration, and now it’s been my goal to reach out to them and let them know that we want to work with them because working together can yield the best results for the LIU community as a whole,” he said. “I meet with Michael Berthel every other week, and we have a fantastic relationship. He cares about the student body. There are certain things that we might not necessarily agree on what would be best, but it’s always my job to take the side of the students and gauge what they’re looking for, and then we go to him, we talk about it and I work hard to make sure that he knows what they want because that’s ultimately my job.”
LaPollo believes SGA should play a prevalent role in the campus community and wants everyone to know that they are students, for the students.
 “Last semester, we had a banquet where we invited student leaders and some members of the faculty. The goal of that was not only to bring everybody together but share the SGA message with student leaders so that they can then relay it onto their organizations,” he said. “By letting people know that we can make real change and we have the ability to talk to people who can make a direct change, and if you look around campus, we’ve seen it already.” 
LaPollo emphasizes that sometimes it is necessary to be tough on administration, and it’s something he is more than willing to do if necessary. 
“We have to be tough on administration because if they’re not producing for the students in a way that we think is appropriate, if the students are asking for something repeatedly and they’re not getting it, then it’s our job to be tough on that, and really double down and make sure that their needs are being heard. As president of the SGA, that’s always something that I do,” he said.
LaPollo is excited about what SGA was able to accomplish last semester and the pace for growth. 
“So last semester was mainly about getting the program back because we were kind of starting at a point where we didn’t have an identity. We weren’t really as known on campus, so it was our goal to get that message out,” he said. “We are increasing our presence on social media. We started posting more to keep the public up to date with what we’re working on. We have committees that go around campus, and they look at things that need to be fixed or things that could potentially be added.”
 LaPollo has no plans on stopping or slowing down from the progress made at Post. He is working hard on growing the presence of student voices via GroupMe. 
“We’ve been able to create The Student Body chat, which we’re really happy about. We have a little over 400 people in there right now, so I’ve been proud of getting the word out with SGA,” he said. “The more people that are in there, the more voices we can hear. So we want to increase outreach. We want to go and talk to more people to come and fix things on campus. There are glaring issues that you know people bring up to us sometimes that we wouldn’t necessarily notice if they didn’t.” 
LaPollo wants students to know they can come to SGA with any concerns or desires to start new clubs. 
“We’re always active on Instagram. You can shoot us a DM, and we will be posting a lot more information through there about the university and our program specifically and with The Student Body GroupMe,” he said. “If you post a concern there, one of us will see it as a member of the executive board, whether it’s myself or any of the other individuals. I find that a lot of times when one person has an issue with something, 20 other people or more have the same issue, so putting that in GroupMe is even better.”
As for new clubs, LaPollo ensures everyone’s voices are heard and hopes to expand ideas to fit anyone’s interests in the campus community.
 “We’re very open-minded. We approve all sorts of different clubs, so anyone can go to experience Shark Nation through Promise, and then once they have 10 to 15 members in their organization, they can email SGA, and we will give them a date to come in for approval,” LaPollo said. 
LaPollo truly believes in the campus community and ensures SGA will work to meet the needs of every student. 
“We are going to reach out to the students to get the students’ ideas and concerns, but we would like them to reach out to us as well. We would really encourage people to contact us as much as possible, and I don’t care how controversial it is,” he said. “Our relationship with the administration is fantastic, and we have a lot of respect for them, but I’m not afraid to bring those controversial issues to their desk if it needs to because our job is to represent the student body. Use your voice if you see an issue, don’t be afraid to share it with everyone else as well, and that’s how we could bring the community closer.”

On Thursday, Dec.  2, 2021, Major League Baseball announced they were locking out the players. This is due to the ending of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that expired the day prior. 
This is nothing new, as CBA contracts between the league’s owners and the Major League Baseball Players Association(MLBPA) are negotiated roughly every five years. Typically, negotiations for a new CBA are underway while the old contract is still in use, and the new CBA can go into effect immediately when needed. However, the owners and players union have yet to agree on terms for a new CBA, ultimately leading to the lockout currently in effect. 
This is the first time since 1994 that a work stoppage has occurred in the MLB. In 1994, the players went on strike mid-season, ultimately leading to the season being canceled and no playoffs or World Series held. 
As of now, no free agent signings can occur, players cannot use any team facilities, and players are not allowed to talk with anyone who works with the league or anyone with managerial/upper management status from any team. 
Spring Training is set to begin less than one month from now, on Feb.  26. If no deal is reached, games will be delayed. If the lockout continues to last into March, it will force a shortened MLB season until both sides agree on a new CBA. 
From what it looks like currently, league owners want a lower luxury tax threshold, which would force teams to spend less on players each season to avoid penalties. Small market team owners in particular have demands to fit their desires. This includes more revenue sharing among owners, which would allow small-market teams to acquire more money from teams in more favorable markets. They would also like to expand the playoffs to 14 teams, making it a more competitive playing field for teams that spend less.
On the other hand, players want none of these rule changes, as they feel it would cause teams in all markets to spend less overall and force their salaries down. They would also want to raise the minimum league salary of $570,500 and make it easier for players to enter free agency. 
MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has expressed interest in a pitch clock, which he feels would speed up the pace of play. However, the MLBPA feels this is unfair to pitchers who have a set style they have used their entire lives. Other potential rule changes to be discussed are a universal designated hitter (DH) in the National League and the possibility of an automated strike zone to call balls and strikes. 
Junior digital art and design major Anthony Hines is a lifelong Yankees and baseball fan. Hines is unhappy with what is currently taking place. 
“I think the lockout is ultimately ruining the experience for fans who love the sport. Leaving fans in the dark is not good for the sport,” he said. 
Hines believes the players and the Players Union should be more reasonable in their negotiations. 
“In my opinion, I think the players should shut it. You already make enough money as is. Let’s just get to playing games already,” he said. “It’s ridiculous that we as fans have to wait this long.”
Hines would like to see some major changes coming to the sport once both sides agree upon the new CBA. 
“I would love to see expanded playoffs as well as a universal DH, which I definitely expect to be a part of 2022,” he said. “I also wouldn’t be surprised if we see some big rule changes going forward.”
Sophomore adolescent education major Ryan Kaim is hoping to enjoy a baseball season as a fan of the Mets after all the quick free agent signings and player acquisitions pre-lockout. 
“This lockout is frustrating and puts a lot of fans in limbo who await the beginning of spring training and the transactions involving the biggest available free agents,” Kaim said. 
Kaim would like to see more negotiations coming from both sides.
 “I believe both sides have their own issues I disagree with, but I believe the players are more in the right, the owners have come across as greedy and unwilling to compromise while the players’ demands seem to exceed what is truly possible,” he said. 
Kaim wants more teams to play more competitively in the new CBA and de-incentivize teams losing games on purpose for monetary gain. 
“I believe the CBA needs to focus on tanking. All teams should be dedicated to their fan bases, willing to do whatever they can to field a competitive team,” he said. “Alongside, I believe increases in minor league salaries are warranted with the conditions they are given.”
Kaim is excited for all the free-agent signings and trades that are to come immediately upon the new CBA agreement, as teams will rush to fill their rosters before the season starts. 
“I expect a raging hot stove once free agency comes back to life as many are looking to head into spring training with the pitchers and catchers report coming very soon,” he said. “I believe the changes will resolve some matters. However, I believe we should be concerned with the relations between the MLBPA and MLB as this lockout signifies a wide gap in ideals.”
Kaim is certain that no matter the end outcome, this will be a memorable moment in time and could set a precedent for how the league and the players view each other from here on out. 
“The lockout changes the landscape in that with the reforms made, the sport from top to bottom will have mostly improved and modernized to the needs of the players,” he said. “I just fear that the lockout signifies potential future outcomes similar to this or the 1994 season when the next CBA expires.”

The National Football League (NFL) kicked off its second ever Super Wild Card Weekend on Saturday, Jan. 15, with the new playoff format giving fans a six game slate of playoff football. After expanding their playoffs to include a seventh team from each conference in the 2020 NFL season, the league decided to continue this tradition for the 2021 season.
The 2021 NFL playoffs started at Paul Brown stadium when the resurgent Los Vegas Raiders took on the red hot Cincinnati Bengals. This was one of the more exciting games from the weekend, as the No. 4 seed Bengals narrowly edged out the No. 7 seed Raiders thanks to a goal line interception by Cincinnati LB Germaine Pratt; which gave the Bengals the 26-19 victory, their first playoff win since 1991. 
After watching the Bengals continue to play great football in their first playoff victory in over 30 years, sophomore broadcasting major Brady Campbell believes that they could be a team to look out for down the stretch. 
“The Bengals really surprised me,” he said. “I thought they would win this weekend, but after watching that game, I do think they have what it takes to make a Super Bowl run.”
The final game on Saturday saw divisional rivals square off as ROTY candidate Mac Jones and the No. 6 seed New England Patriots traveled to Buffalo to take on the No. 3 seed Bills. Unfortunately for New England fans, this game was a blowout from the very beginning, as Josh Allen and the Bills went on a 27-0 run before allowing the Patriots to get a FG before the half. This game was never close, and the Bills went on to win 47-17. 
With Buffalo winning in dominant fashion, sophomore broadcasting major Brendan Kaufman had high praise for what he considers to be the “hottest team in football.”
“The Bills are on fire. Like wow, they look like a team that is just unstoppable,” he said. “Not many teams can put up 7 straight touchdown drives. How do you even beat that? If they can keep that up, they are the Super Bowl favorites.”
The No. 2 seed Tampa Bay Buccaneers hosted the No. 7 seed Philadelphia Eagles to start the three game slate on Sunday, Jan. 16. In another one-sided affair, the Buccaneers dominated the Eagles in every facet of the game, and won 31-15. 
For Kaufman, this was a dreadful game to sit through.
“I watched the entire Buccaneers vs. Eagles game, and to be honest, I wish I didn’t watch any of it,” he said. “It was hard to watch.”
After two consecutive blowouts, NFL fans around the country were hoping for a competitive one when the No. 6 seed San Francisco 49ers took on the No. 3 seed Dallas Cowboys. This game was the most competitive out of the entire weekend, and 41.496 million viewers tuned into what is now the most viewed Wild Card game in NFL history. 
With the eyes of the world on them, America’s team came out flat in the first half, and San Francisco took full advantage, going into halftime with a 16-7 lead. However, Dallas made a comeback late in the 4th quarter, scoring 10 straight before running out of time on their final possession of the game, sealing the 49ers 23-17 win. 
Unlike many fans, Campbell was not surprised by this 49ers upset victory. 
“The 49ers were pretty underrated heading into the postseason,” he said. “I wouldn’t be too surprised if they beat the Packers this week if they are able to get healthy.”
Kaufman agreed, citing that the 49ers are a team that no one wants to play as the postseason progresses. 
“I was impressed by the 49ers,” he said. “They pulled through despite almost throwing the game in the end, and I think they are a team to look out for moving forward, as they can beat any team left in the playoffs.”
To finish off Sunday’s slate of football, the No. 7 seed Pittsburgh Steelers traveled to Arrowhead to take on the No. 2 seed Kansas City Chiefs. After an outstanding play by the likely DPOTY T.J. Watt gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead early in the 2nd quarter, the Chiefs absolutely took over the game, scoring 35 unanswered points as they coasted to a 42-21 victory. 
After watching both No. 7 seeds get blown out this weekend, Campbell believes that these games exposed a flaw in the NFL’s new playoff format. 
“I am a little concerned about the 2 vs. 7 seed games,” he said. “The 7 seed doesn’t deserve to be there a lot of the time, as it’s the threshold that makes you question if the team really deserved to make the playoffs.”
The final game of the Super Wild Card weekend actually came after the weekend was over, as divisional rivals squared off for the first Monday night playoff game in NFL history. The No. 4 seed Los Angeles Rams hosted the No. 5 seed Arizona Cardinals in a game that not even the Manningcast could make interesting, as the Rams dominated the Cardinals from the opening kickoff in an impressive 34-11 victory. 
With a lot of these games not living up to fans expectations, Kaufman has a strong opinion about the NFL’s Super Wild Card Weekend. 
“I think the new playoff format kind of sucks to be honest. It isn’t going away any time soon because the NFL likes making money and people love to watch football, so obviously if you add another playoff game people are gonna watch it,” he said. “I just wish the games were a little more interesting and the 7 seeds weren’t so terrible, as neither the Steelers or Eagles deserved to be playoff teams.”
Overall, the NFL’s Super Wild Card weekend had its ups and downs, and despite a lot of games that fans felt disappointed by, it brought a wide variety of great moments that students think made it a great weekend of NFL football.
