On Wednesday, April 13 at 6 p.m., the women of the sorority Delta Zeta will be hosting Hoops for Hearing, a five-on-five charity basketball tournament, at the Pratt Recreation Center. There will be both a men’s and women’s bracket; with teams of five players and a coach of the team’s choice or one provided by Delta Zeta. The event is open to sports teams, as well as anyone else from the Post community that wants to participate. 
Delta Zeta is running this basketball event to help support the Starkey Hearing Foundation in its mission to “provide people all over the world with hearing aids, completely free of charge.” The national sorority has pledged to try to raise $5 million in five years to help support the foundation.
Research shows that one out of eight children and teens in the United States has permanent hearing loss, caused by high-volume sounds. This is an alarming trend that has increased 30 percent in the last decade alone. It is also a condition that, in most cases, is 100 percent preventable through better listening habits.
Theresa Kelly, a freshman music education major, and the Vice President of Programs for the LIU Post chapter of Delta Zeta, said, “We’re really excited to get the entire school community involved in this playfully competitive basketball tournament for an amazing cause. In addition to seeing some of your friends and classmates going head to head in five-on-five games, there will also be lots of chances to win some awesome raffle baskets made by the sisters of Delta Zeta!”
In addition to the games, the event will also have a special halftime performance, which has yet to be decided, and raffles. Each basketball game will be about ten minutes long. The team with the most points at the end of ten minutes will advance to the next round.
In order to bring awareness to the philanthropy’s mission to improve speech and hearing, the final round will be a silent game. During this game, players will not be allowed to make any noise. If they do, every time they talk, their team will donate $1 to the charity.
Alyssa Hu, junior finance major and the president of Delta Zeta, said, “I am so excited for our philanthropy event this semester, Hoops for Hearing. I think that it will be a great night for everyone. I can only hope that we will be as, or even more successful as last semester.” Last semester, the Delta Zeta sisters raised $1,000 at an event called Dr. DeZirable, which was a male pageant that consisted of three rounds, dress to impress, talent and Q&A . “I really want to encourage everyone to come out and join us for this event. Not only will it be a lot of fun, but it will help make a difference in someone’s life,” said Hu.
“The gift of hearing opens up a whole new world of opportunity. It connects individuals to life and helps them realize they can accomplish more than they ever thought possible,” said Brittany Amadio, a junior early childhood education major and a member of Delta Zeta.
Tickets for the event will be sold by the Delta Zeta sisters every Wednesday in Hillwood Commons during common hour. Tickets to attend are $3 at tabling and $5 at the door. Teams of five will be $25 or $5 per player. Questions can be referred to Delta Zeta’s Vice President of Philanthropy, Brittney Amadio, at Brittney.Amadio@my.liu.edu

Hillwood Commons is undoubtedly the primary rendezvous location for Post students. Starbucks, Subway, the ‘fishbowl’ and other meeting areas make Hillwood Commons a mainstay. Yet, space in Hillwood Commons is limited. The Student Government Association is pushing for a renovation of the second floor of Hillwood Commons, due to its outdated seating and inadequacy to accommodate large numbers of students. Adam Hornbuckle, a sophomore political science major and Vice President of the SGA, believes that Hillwood’s second floor is due for a ‘revamp,’ and he’s gathering the signatures to do so.
“We have about 250 signatures,” said Hornbuckle, “We’re specifically looking for new couches and more sitting area for studying. We’d also like to see new carpet and paint.” A ‘total revamp’ is what Hornbuckle is calling for, and it seems he has the support of his peers. Melina Vazquez, a junior biology major, was ecstatic when she heard what Hornbuckle and the SGA are trying to accomplish. “If they can get the second floor of Hillwood renovated, that would be a power move,” Vazquez said. “I commute, and when I’m early for class, I usually spend my time on the second floor of Hillwood, and to be honest, it can get crowded and uncomfortable. Renovations are needed.”
Clara Leone, a freshman undeclared major, agreed with Vazquez, claiming that the second floor of Hillwood ‘looks like it can be barely house 40 people.’ “No way is the second floor of Hillwood able to sustain any crowd gathering here. It looks like it hasn’t been renovated since 1980, and it has literally 12 seats.” According to collegedata.com, approximately 8,700 undergraduate and graduate students attend LIU Post, many of whom, at some point pass through Hillwood Commons. The Pioneer reached out Post’s admission’s office for a current figure on enrollment, however, a representative from the office claimed they are not allowed to give The Pioneer a figure on current enrollment.
In order to achieve their goal of renovating the much-used space in Hillwood, SGA must win over Post’s administration, in particular LIU President Kimberly Cline. The Pioneer reached out to President Cline, but she did not respond. Instead, Abigail Van Vlerah, Post’s Dean of Students, said, “I think it would be more appropriate to comment on this when the Student Government Association has submitted their proposal. I look forward to seeing what they have in mind.”
Hornbuckle insists that SGA will submit a proposal once they finished ‘drafting proposals for the space.’ Post students wishing to add their signature to SGA’s renovation petition can do so by visiting SGA’s Facebook page at facebook.com/liupost.sga.

The office of Campus Life will host LIU Post’s Take Back the Night event on March 31 in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall at 7 p.m.
“Take Back the Night is an event that brings awareness to the campus community regarding sexual assault and domestic violence,” said Cheyenne Oberther, programming specialist for Campus Life. The event will raise awareness and unite our community against sexual assault and domestic violence. Post is still requiring students to complete the mandatory Haven Course on Sexual Assault, this event however, is a separate event to raise awareness.
On a website entitled The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), “Women ages 18-24 who are enrolled in college are three times more likely than women in general to suffer from sexual violence.” With numbers this high, many universities like Post are holding events like this to speak out against sexual assault.
The Take Back the Night Committee, composed of students, will be hosting awareness programs during common hour every Tuesday leading up to the event. These will include a self-defense course, campaign awareness, and a visual display. They are going to help to engage students and the campus community and promote participation in the March 31 event.
Theresa Kelley, a freshman music education major, said, “When I found out this event would be taking place at Post, I immediately wanted to have a part in the planning process. College campuses get an awful reputation for being unsafe. Hosting events like Take Back the Night increase awareness for this massive national problem, as well as help increase understanding and support in our own community for survivors and advocates alike. It shows that we will not stand for this on our campus. I’m very excited to for this event and even more excited to see in grow in years to come.”
The event will include a display in which student organizations will have the opportunity to cosponsor and have their names displayed on t-shirts. Students will also have the opportunity to create slogans to display in Hillwood Commons in an effort to publically show their stance against violence. There will also be a keynote speaker, who has yet to be decided, and a march following the main portion of the event. Students are encouraged to participate in designing their own banner and follow along with chants, which will be an opportunity for students to speak out and be heard.
“Sexual assault and domestic violence are important topics and we are happy to have a student-led committee that is leading this initiative,” said Michael Berthel, director of Campus Life.
“Campus Life is looking forward to the event and I am confident that it will become a long-standing, and successful program. Oberther has worked hard to engage students and student organizations to get involved,” said Berthel.
Students who want to get involved in the planning, or attend the event, can contact Campus Life’s Cheyenne Oberther at Cheyenne.Oberther@ liu.edu or at 516-299-3594.

Starting this semester, undergraduate students at Post will be able to take Management 81, a seminar that provides students with the opportunity to become consultants for nonprofit organizations. A similar course had been available to students at the graduate level, but this is the first semester the three-credit course is offered to undergraduate students.
According to Dr. James Freeley, an Associate Professor of Management who created the course ten years ago for graduate students, the difference between entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship is the focus and main goal of the business. Entrepreneurship is “starting a new business to make a profit,” but “social entrepreneurship wants to solve a problem in society and secondarily make a profit.” Freeley said that within the last ten years, social entrepreneurships have become “an emerging trend in business.”
According to an LIU Post press release from May 7, 2014, graduate students collaborated with Strength for Life and Enactus. The two nonprofit organizations look to improve the lives of cancer patients through exercise, and using entrepreneurial action to help those in need. During the spring semester of 2014, students enrolled in the social en trepreneurship course helped the organizations with common business problems such as marketing strategies and ways of funding. They also learned how to make a business plan and “a profit without relying on government grants or charitable donations.”
This semester, undergraduate students have the opportunity to work on three consulting projects. For the first one, students can work with a nonprofit religious organization by planning the organization’s annual event. The second project involves students helping the same organization develop a brand. The third consulting project is with a start-up agricultural business that barters natural food and needs help determining what direction to go in.
“I like to call it a win-win-win situation,” Freeley said. “It’s great for students because they get to apply theoretical knowledge to real business situations.” Freeley also said that businesses benefit because they get the expertise from students “trained in various skills in business,” and LIU Post benefits because it is able to give back to the community.
“Some of the students told me this whole process really opened their eyes to a whole different area that they can use their skills in other than private enterprise,” Freeley said.
