“¡Venceremos porque nacimos para triunfar!” or, in English: “We will win because we were born to succeed.”
This quote is the national slogan for LIU’s newest multicultural organization, Latino America Unida, Lambda Alpha Upsilon fraternity (Lambda).
On the forefront of Lambda is alumni Malcolm McDaniel, who graduated in 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in speech language pathology and audiology. McDaniel tried to begin a Lambda chapter during his senior year, but was unable to meet the five initiated members minimum to become a recognized chapter. Now, McDaniel has decided to make another attempt at bringing Lambda to campus.
“I know right now at LIU Post there are no culturally based organizations,” McDaniel said, “so I definitely feel that representation is needed. Not just specifically for Latino organizations, but there are various underrepresented organizations that are not [a part of the] Interfraternity Council (IFC) [or considered] Panhellenic.”
Lambda is not only for self-identifying Latino men. It is open to all men who want to commit themselves to a cause that is bigger than themselves. While the organization’s forefathers were all of Latino descent, the members pride themselves on creating a diverse brotherhood.
“[While] we are a Latino based fraternity, we are not Latino exclusive. The beauty of my organization is that although [it is] Latino based, you still learn more about your own culture and the cultures within your member class,” McDaniel said.
Lambda Alpha Upsilon was founded on Dec. 10, 1985 at SUNY Buffalo by 16 men of diverse backgrounds. The group was founded on and still follows the “metas” (goals) of brotherhood, scholarship and community service.
According to Joseph Vernace, senior associate director of campus life, expansion within the Greek community is always a student-lead initiative. However, the processes for approval are different depending on the organization’s governing council. Because Lambda is a multicultural group, it has a different set of requirements in order to meet approval.
“Students that wish to bring a new cultural Greek organization to campus have to start by getting interest of at least five to ten qualified candidates for membership. From there, the University begins contact with the national organization,” Vernace explained.
“I highly encourage students interested in bringing Lambda Alpha Upsilon Fraternity, Inc., or any other cultural organization to campus, to complete the cultural Greek interest form,” Vernace said.
Opinions on this new fraternity range among the student body. J Fordsman, a sophomore psychology and criminal justice major, as well as a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, has mixed feelings about Lambda.
“I think it will benefit the campus, if only because it allows us to fulfill our National Fraternity Council and Panhellenic requirements. However, I know that multicultural organizations almost always die out. So I don’t have high expectations for this one to remain a fixed feature on our campus,” Fordsman said.
On the other hand, Storm Keeler, a freshmen art therapy and psychology major, has a different opinion.
“I think it’s great that there’s going to be a new Latino based fraternity, because culture-based fraternities and sororities often provide strong on-campus support and help bring more appreciation and pride to the culture they represent,” Keeler said.
Those interested in Lambda Alpha Upsilon can contact Mc- Daniels at malcolm.mcdaniels@ my.liu.edu or fill out the Greek Cultural Interest Form at www.liu. edu/Post/Greek. Lambda will also be tabling on Tuesday, Sept. 25, Wednesday, Sept. 26 and Thurs- day, Oct. 11 in Hillwood Commons.

Some commuter students are still finding it hard to adjust to the new “Pioneer Wagon” student shuttle departure schedule. The change is departure time was made in the 2017-2018 academic year; it leaves from Hillwood Commons every hour instead of every 30 minutes.
The year before, the school had two buses running with a 30-minute gap. The changes were made to reflect, “an analysis on the use and demand of the Pioneer Wagon […] after the 2016-2017 academic year,” according to Joseph Vernace, senior associate director of campus life.
Christopher Rock, a senior game design major, takes the shuttle to school every day. The schedule changes haven’t bothered him.
“I think the shuttle is convenient. Even though there’s only one shuttle running back and forth now, it’s always available to me in the mornings,” he said. Rock also stated that if the school shuttle is unavailable, there are other solutions. “There are the n20H buses. They drive past the school and have two shuttles so that is an alternative,” he said.
Anton Ocampo, a freshman digital arts and design major, has had difficulties with the reduced schedule. He said he thinks it’s hard to time the shuttle schedule with his classes. he shuttle usually leaves 30 minutes before his classes start and the traffic is unreliable, Ocampo said.
“Either I will have to run in to the classroom, or take the shuttle the hour before and sit around and wait for 50 minutes,” he said. Ocampo has many of his classes in Lorber Hall. This forces him to take an earlier shuttle to be able to get to class on time.
“Because of the shuttle only leaving once every hour, I sometimes have to leave my home two hours before my class starts. You never know if we are going to be stuck in traffic,” he explained.
Ocampo also pointed out that he sometimes feels stressed because of the shuttle and that it “robs” him of his sleep.
“I never know when we are going to arrive. If I take the shuttle right before my class, I might have to run. If I take the early bus, I don’t get enough sleep. That is very stressful,” he said.
Oliver Bennett, a senior marketing major, has also experienced uncertainty with the new schedule. “You don’t know when it’s going to show up. If it’s running late, maybe because of the traffic, you sometimes have to wait for 40 minutes now when there is only one shuttle,” he said.
Bennet believes that the school should take responsibility. “If the school provides a service, they have to take traffic into account when they make a schedule,” he said. Ocampo also thinks that the school should invest in the shuttle service. “We pay a lot of money to go to this school. I would rather see my tuition money being spent on improving the shuttle service so I can get to my classes in time, instead of putting extra dining dollars on my LIU card,” Ocampo said.
The campus shuttle faced budget cuts in the fall 2017 semester. In the Sept. 19, 2017 article, “Campus Shuttle Faces Budget Cuts,” The Pioneer reported that the student government association, which oversees student activity fees and program, resource and service funding, decided to cut the shuttle budget to allocate “sufficient operational funding” to other student organizations.
Vernace responded to student criticism of the shuttle’s reduced schedule by encouraging students to take responsibility. “There are some things out of our control, such as traffic and weather. However, we strongly encourage students to always leave themselves extra time to ensure they are not late,” Vernace said.

The Be The Change club is celebrating its third anniversary on campus this November. Club president Adam Silverstein is excited for the upcoming events this semester.
Throughout the week of September 17, they ran their bake sale to raise money for Challenge Day, the organization behind the inspiration for the club. “It’s more than just a bake sale,” Silverstein said. People can also write positive post-it notes or compliments on index cards.

Silverstein, a junior social work major, started the club during his first year at Post. The club has since been a strong presence at Post, known for leaving surprise positive messages for students to find around campus.
The first major club event was a mixer on Sunday, Sept. 9. “[It was] a chance for everyone to kick of the school year,” Silverstein said. Freshmen were able to get involved and meet other members in their official introduction to the club.
Club members are still planning their next big event, but students can expect it to happen around the second week of October. The goal of the next event is “to show love to ourselves and to take care of yourself, and to have a healthy relationship with yourself,” Silverstein said. They will also host a Halloween Spooktacular, Thanksgiving and winter holiday parties.
Silverstein is planning a new event this year – a diversity showcase. “[It’s] a celebration of different cultures, races, religions [and] abilities; a celebration of how we can appreciate each other’s differences,” he explained.
Matt Goldstein, a senior criminal justice major and the vice president of Be the Change, said he’s looking forward to “getting more members to the club; [and attracting] more outsiders to the events.”
Goldstein is looking forward to You Are Noticed Day. “It helps [students] who feel left out know that they are noticed and loved,” he said. The event allows students to talk about their personal experiences. “This year, I’m going to talk about how LIU has helped me become more social and to expand.”
The Be the Change club meets every Thursday during common hour in Hillwood Commons room 221.

The new veterinary technology program started this fall. Twenty-two students are enrolled in the first class, Introduction to Veterinary Science 101. Dr. Robin Sturtz, the director of the newly founded program, shares the components of the early lessons.
“We cover a little bit of everything [in Intro to Vet Science] to give students a taste of what the profession is like,” she said. “Veterinary technology is so wonderful because there are so many utilizations.”
According to Sturtz, many professionals work in clinical practice, however, teaching and research are also viable tracks in the industry.
“We try to give them information on all the different routes they can go,” said Professor Lori Asprea, an instructor and clinical coordinator. “We also try to touch on, at a surface level, a variety of the things they will encounter”
To prepare the new students for vet tech, the introduction class covers an assortment of subjects including general medicine, diseases, anatomy, physiology and pharmacology.
The program is rigorous and requires participants to maintain certain academic standards. “Once students enter this program they have to have a C plus or better in all vet tech courses and natural sciences,” Sturtz explained.
The requirement allows all students to understand the challenges associated with veterinary science. “A lot of people unfortunately believe the industry is playing with puppies but that is not the case,” Sturtz said.
Though challenging, the rewards from the program are apparent by both the students and faculty.
Gaby Furman, a sophomore vet tech major, is eager to continue her education in this field. “Becoming a veterinarian has always been my goal and I think this program is going to help me get closer to achieving that,” Furman said. “I believe it will give me an opportunity to learn more and get hands on experience in the field, and I am super excited to see where it goes.”
The program does provide hands-on experience. “We strive for our students to explore and gain different routes of exposure,” Asprea said. “Each student [is required to have] three externships and over 500 hours of clinical time.”
Students learn the business applications of managing a facility as well. According to Asprea, the course, Veterinary Management, focuses on client relations and what is entailed successful operation. “You must simultaneously comfort the client and recognize the animal’s problem,” she said. “There is much more than the science behind the practice, you have to use your intuition.”

Students didn’t forget to register to vote for the upcoming midterm elections this week as they passed by registration tables in Hillwood Commons. Tuesday Sept. 25, 2018 was national voter registration day. During common hour, The League of Women Voters, a non-partisan organization encouraging women to get engaged in the political process, set up a registration table to encourage students to register to vote.

Chana Hancox, a sophomore double major in business management and psychology, helped hand out student voter registration forms.
“Voting is what makes a change in the most simplistic way,” she said. “To have your voice be a part of something bigger not only makes a difference societally, but also for ones grounding.”
The 2018 midterm elections are Tuesday, Nov. 6. The deadline to register to vote in New York is Friday, Oct. 12. To register, change your political party or request an absentee ballot, students can visit the local DMV or online by creating an account at my.dmv.ny.gov. To see your voter registration status, visit voterlookup.elections.ny.gov. To find out who is on the ballot, visit VOTE411.org. For all other voter information, visit VOTE.org

Kelly-Ann Rivera, a senior film studies major, began to face new challenges on campus when the fall 2018 semester started. Over the summer, Rivera had complications resulting from a surgery to remove a tumor on her spine. Over the summer the doctors had found a non-cancerous tumor growing out from her spine onto her kidney.

“The doctors are very shocked that I was neurologically fine, and that I was walking just fine the way I was,” Rivera said. After her surgery, she was left temporarily paralyzed. For the past three months, she has been regaining strength in her legs. To get around campus, she uses a walker. However, she’s discovered that campus is not easy to navigate with a walker, much less a wheelchair.
Rivera found it almost impossible to use the bathroom in Humanities Hall, where one of her classes is located. “Toilets in general are very low. I don’t know if you’ve ever noticed, but now you’ll notice ‘this is very low for me to get down to,’” she said.
“It’s very hard for me to get down to a toilet, because I don’t have the strength in my calves or thighs to hold on in order to get down. So, in Humanities Hall, I’m literally slamming myself down onto the toilet. And since there’s no handicapped [stalls] accessible, there aren’t any bars to lift myself up. I’m lifting myself up through the trash bin. And every time I think ‘I’m going to break it.’ And if I break it, I’m going to fall.” The trash bin Rivera refers to is not a large garbage bin for paper towels, but the small bin in each stall for used sanitary products.

Rivera mentioned that the stall does not provide enough room for her walker. “I have to leave my walker outside of the stall, and then I have to go very slowly so I don’t trip,” she said. “Because if I fall, I can’t get back up. What if I was in my wheelchair? I would not be able to use the bathroom at all.”
Although there is a ramp leading into Humanities, the handicapped door does not open when the button is pushed. On September 20, The Pioneer discovered that the door is still not working.
“I love school so much, I hate missing a day,” Rivera said. She tried to Skype into her classes, however the sound was lackluster. She said her professors do their best to accommodate her, but often point her in the direction of Disability Support Services.
“I haven’t been the library yet because it’s farther,” she said. “I know it’s wheelchair accessible; I know there’s an elevator, but I don’t know where. I haven’t been to Hillwood yet; I haven’t been to the bookstore, I don’t know if it’s handicap accessible. Now I don’t know what is accessible.”
Walking can be fatiguing for Rivera. “I don’t want to waste my energy [going to a building] not to be able to get in,” she said. “Before, I would go to Hillwood, I would go to Starbucks.”
Roy Fergus, the executive director of facilities, did not respond The Pioneer’s inquires about either the bathroom or the door situation.

James Bednarz, professor of English, has returned this semester from his 2017- 2018 sabbatical, which he spent at his home in New York City, writing a book entitled, “The Art of Shakespeare.”
The new book is “an attempt to look at how the visual arts were not only a part of Shakespeare’s time and his performances, but the way in which through the centuries artists have tried to envision both Shakespeare and his work, his characters and plots, even his metaphors, in the case of William Blake, who seizes on lines of Shakespeare and makes pictures of that,” Bednarz said.
“Nobody has yet focused on Shakespeare’s continuing creative force in modern and contemporary art, and nobody has shown the profound links between his past and our present that are very much alive,” Bednarz wrote in his sabbatical report to Nathaniel Bowditch, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
Bednarz found his time away from teaching to be refreshing and regenerative. “I think teaching and research should be inextricably bound together, and the more that you know the better a teacher you are, and so it’s just nice to have time to look in-depth at ideas and problems that come up in teaching and come up in the intellectual life of anyone who’s interested in the liberal arts,” he said.
He appreciated the “undivided time” that allowed him to focus on a few central projects while also accommodating incoming projects such as working on five articles (three of them published, two forthcoming) and drafting a key-note address for the playwright John Marston.
“If you’ve written, a lot people ask you to contribute to volumes they’re doing, and so writing becomes a kind of expanded field depending on how much you do,” he said.
Bednarz began teaching at Post around 1980 as an adjunct professor for a year and then became a full time professor. “My colleagues are superb people, and the students are remarkable. It’s always been stimulating,” he said. “I’ve never actually applied to any position at any other university since Post has been so collegial and so good to me actually,” he said.
Bednarz took a previous sabbatical in 2009- 2010, during which he completed “Shakespeare and the Truth of Love,” published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2012.
In addition to his interest in Shakespeare and art, Bednarz turns more and more to theories of adaptation. “I’ve increasingly looked at how a variety of different artists have made other things out of [Shakespeare’s] work, and converted his work into so many multi-form shapes that the term ‘Shakespeare’ becomes not a reference to an individual but to a body of imaginative exploration of what it means to be a human being.”
In his report to Bowditch, he said, “Artists continue to see themselves as Hamlet, from Eugène Delacroix’s romantic self-portrait as the melancholy Dane to Nicole Eisenman’s contemporary, gender-bending depiction of herself in character.”
Bednarz considers the humanities to be educationally and practically valuable. “I think the basic question that the humanities ask is, ‘What does it mean to be a human? What does it mean to have responsibilities with other human beings?’ If the humanities don’t address that, I think they abrogate their major responsibility, which is an interrogation of the very terms of what it means to be a human being,” he said.
He also considers the humanities to be valuable in terms of presenting oneself to businesses and in the workforce. “Aside from the big questions about the valuable life, the humanities, especially English, give students a way of articulating their positions in a society in which positions are often obfuscated, in which lies seem to dominate national politics. Giving students the ability to not only clarify what they think, but come to terms with major issues, to tell their stories, [is good]. The fundamental ability to express yourself is at the heart of every enterprise,” Bednarz said. Bednarz teaches Writing II: Research and Argumentation, World Literature I: From Antiquity to the Renaissance, and Shakespeare: Comedies and Histories, Non-Dramatic Poetry.
Bednarz recommends that everyone read Shakespeare. “He addresses everything that great literature should do. He has a profound understanding of the human heart, of the human intellect, of the way in which society can be often dominated by tyrants, how the illumination of the world is necessary again and again by a kind of vociferous fighting to make it right, and eloquence that has rarely been matched [and] never surpassed, plots and characters that are infinitely interesting and infinitely capable of being remade in ways that are surprising and unforeseen.”
He considers “Richard III” to be the most politically relevant play, and “Hamlet” to be eternally relevant, especially for the character “who explores interiority in terms of his own grief, in terms of his own sense of alienation, that remains especially for students in college.”
He also praises Homer and John Milton as authors who are as relevant today as they were in their times.
Bednarz’s sabbatical has enriched his teaching. “The more I look at Shakespeare, the more I see the way in which adaptations occur, the more I’m open to new ways of looking at Shakespeare, and it’s been an absolutely enriching [experience] to reappraise and reevaluate. The wonderful thing about Shakespeare is that he changes every time you read him because you see new things and you’re a new person.”

The Kung-Fu club takes a modern approach to an ancient practice. Club president Zhexu Zheng, a junior political science major, incorporated the essentials of different martial arts styles to create a style that is practical and easy to learn.
Zheng practices various forms of Kung-Fu, having trained for five years in Jeet Kune Do in China. He founded the club in 2016 under the objective to help others better themselves. Despite the uniqueness of his teaching style, Zheng is adamant that his shared knowledge be used correctly. “We combine the essentials. It is important to understand the martial spirit [and] the morality. You should be a good person,” Zheng said.
The club is built around the idea of humility, to never use what you know unless it’s necessary. One of the core ideas of Kung-Fu “is not about training yourself for self-defense,” according to Zheng. It’s to help build confidence and discipline. The club ultimately focuses on the betterment of body and mind.
The club’s practice is drawn from Bruce Lee’s approach to mixed martial arts and the methods he used in Jeet-Kune-Do. The first hour of the club focuses on conditioning. This includes stretching and practicing stances that help build the foundation for techniques taught later on.
“The whole idea is that by the end of the semester everyone will be fit and ready to go,” said vice president Carlo Lamorelle, a senior history major. Lamorelle leads the club through conditioning.
Through demonstrations, Zheng breaks down certain strikes, traps and kicks that can be used in a physical altercation. In the last hour the club meets, students apply what they learned through sparring. Students suit up in gloves and mouth guards and use what they learned in a controlled environment.
Kung-Fu may seem complex and the idea of sparring rather intimidating. “No matter what level or what style, we focus on building the engines,” Zheng said. Zheng’s primary focus is strengthening basics skills which leads to mastering more complicated techniques.
Students in the club develop as combatants. Zheng took something complicated and made it accessible to anyone interested; keeping the tradition alive while also instilling the art form’s practicality.
The club meets every Saturday from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the dance studio in Humanities 020.

As the temperatures start to cool and leaves begin to change, the signs of fall have set in. Just because summer has ended doesn’t mean the season for beach bodies has to. With the release of the fall schedule for group fitness classes, the Pratt Recreation Center provides a way for the community to stay in shape. While the price of admission is free, participants should expect to pay through some hard work and sweat.

Classes are held weekly, Monday through Friday, at Pratt and are welcome to all. The schedule features a variety of workouts ranging from high intensity TRX and spin classes to slower paced practices of yoga and pilates. To accommodate the busy schedules of students and faculty, workouts are available daily with options of morning, midday and evening sessions. Classes are taught by certified instructors, each with distinct backgrounds and training in fitness.
Angela Williams-Jones, a yoga instructor, teaches weekly one-hour yoga classes. Jones, who has taught yoga for the past ten years, specializes in both Yin (a practice of deep stretching and active recovery) and Hatha (a simpler flow with a focus on breathing). Her classes draw in a mixture of athletes, professors, students and staff, all of whom enjoy different benefits that yoga has to offer.

Some athletes, such as volleyball players Lauren Kloos and Rachel Londot, practice yoga as a team requirement. Londot, a senior criminal justice and forensics major, said, “[yoga] helps strengthen some of those little muscles that we don’t really use when we’re playing.” Kloos, a sophomore math and science major, agreed. “It helps prevent injury,” she said.
Others like Farina Bayat, a sophomore fine arts major, uses yoga to help restore her sore muscles. “Because of my major sometimes I have to sit and focus on a particular art piece for a long time, so I need to do something like yoga. It’s all about stretching and I really like that.”
“[Yoga] helps your body break through any scar tissue from previous ailments. It helps elongate the muscles and will make you more flexible,” Jones said.
Along with the physical benefits, yoga can provide much-needed mindfulness in the often hectic lives of students and faculty.
“Once you’re able to learn how to get into your breath, you’re able to focus it anywhere and everything can become a moving meditation. Whether you’re playing a game or taking a walk, whatever it is, your movement starts to connect with your breath and you’re able to still everything” Jones said.
Jones’ classes are welcome to all levels. “Don’t be shy,” Jones said, “be open and try it.”
For more information on other class schedules and workout, students can visit the Pratt help desk during regular hours.

A rainbow has appeared in Hillwood Commons after a summer full of drab and gray. This rainbow adds a layer of hope and peace within the campus, and has spread peace and harmony among the land with activism and kindness. Where is this rainbow? It can be found in Room 102 in Hillwood Commons on Wednesdays. This rainbow is known as the Rainbow Alliance.
The Rainbow Alliance is Post’s gay-straight alliance, a place where members of the LGBT+ community and their allies work together to create an all inclusive and harassment free school environment. The officers of the club are President Nicole Ludwig, Vice President Nicholas Frank, Secretary Genesis Cabral, Treasurer Meg Winthrop and Head of Public Relations Sarah Kadtke.
The club went off the radar at the end of last semester. Ludwig revitalized the club this semester with the help of Frank.
“I was wondering what happened to the officers, and I found out that all of them either graduated or they were too busy to start the club [this fall],” Ludwig said. “I felt like when I found this club during orientation [that] I was really happy it was here, it made me feel a lot better about this school and what type of community we have here,” she added.
Frank, a close friend of Ludwig’s, was inspired by her passion for the organization and resolved to assist her in bringing the club back, although he was not in the club last year. “When I saw Nicole was really trying to push it, I realized that it really is a vital cause.”
Ludwig recalled the sense of comfort and safety she felt upon joining the Rainbow Alliance, and wanted to share that experience with students at Post.
“There’s still a lot of ignorant people that don’t know a lot about our community and our struggles and I thought that it was important to continue to bring awareness onto this campus,” Ludwig said.
The club officers have a lot planned for this year, including the return of their annual event “Drag Me to Heaven” in spring 2019, as well as tabling for various LGBT+ holidays such as National Coming Out Day (Oct. 11), and possibly an LGBT+ all-inclusive prom.
One of their most important goals is to educate the campus community, and to prove that all individuals, regardless of gender and or sexual orientation, deserve the chance to pursue happiness.
Storm Keeler, a freshmen art therapy and psychology major, agrees that the club serves a pivotal purpose on campus. “I joined the Rainbow Alliance to help spread awareness to the issues the LGBT+ [community] face and hopefully cultivate more acceptance on campus while simultaneously providing support for the other LGBT+ individuals in the club,” Keeler said. “I think it’s incredibly important to have a LGBT+ and allies based club on every college campus to help counteract the hateful messages LGBT+ youth experience every day.”
Ludwig wants to combat stereotypes that exist about the LGBT+ community, like how one must look in order to be accepted as a lesbian. She herself struggles with people accepting her sexuality because she is a “feminine” individual. But most of all the club members just want people to know that they’re here, and they’ve been part of society for as long as every- one else.
“Some people think we didn’t exist until the 20th century. We just emerged from the ground, and started wandering around during the Civil Rights Movement just in time for Stonewall,” Ludwig said.
Meetings are on Wednesdays during common hour, in Room 102 in Hillwood Commons.

Many don’t realize that students come from far and wide to attend Post, especially those in the theater and performing arts department. This small percentage have to leave their family and friends miles away to pursue their dream. This is the case for senior musical theater major Griffin Lockette. Born and raised in Kailua, Hawaii, which is 4,966 miles away from Post’s gates, Lockette moved to New York to fully immerse herself in the stage light.
Going into her final year, Lockette explains the importance of the Post Theatre Company (PTC), and how the support they provide each other with is monumental, and greatly responsible for her success.
“Having a group of people who are interested in making art and support you in your artistic goals and risk taking, and who are there for you when you fail and encourage you to keep going is absolutely invaluable,” she said. In Lockette’s case, being so far from home has forced PTC to become her home away from home.
“We are definitely a family and we are all made up of such different people from different places with individual gifts and talents, and it’s been an honor not only to learn from my profes- sors and faculty but also to learn from my peers and bear witness to their growth,” Lockette said.
Last summer, Lockette worked on several shows and even took a step back from the stage lights by helping stage manage productions, giving her a different perspective to the world of theatre. “It reminded me that theatre is and always should be a collaborative experience, and that is part of the magic of it,” she said.
Lockette made her debut on screen working in a short film that will be showing in various film festivals this year. “It was a fun project and was a good way for me to apply my acting training and get film experience. I definitely prefer theatre though,” Lockette said.
Being a senior in the theatre department means acting as an exemplar student to the underclassmen, and Lockette is no stray from the trend. In her time at Post, Lockette has established herself on the main stage, having starred in “Trojan Barbie,” “Spring Awakening,” “In The Wake,” and two student projects. One of these projects toured an international festival in Manizales, Colombia.
She is currently in rehearsals for PTC’s upcoming production “Ubu Roi” which opens on Oct. 10. With that said, if she could rewind time, there’s plenty Lockette would alter. “I would tell freshman Griffin to breathe and to let go, and that worrying about things aren’t going to change them,” Lockette said. “I would also tell her to allow herself to be more vulnerable in her work and her friendships and to let people help her when she needs it. That’s something I wish I would’ve learned earlier.”
In terms of what’s to come, Lockette has a strong belief in activism and standing up for a cause; she wants her performances to reflect this importance. “I want to create and be involved in theater that is based on social justice and activism,” she said. “I really want to use art as a means for social change and to bring awareness to things that are considered controversial or taboo, especially in this political climate.”
Lockette, like most PTC members speaks highly of the department as a whole. “I feel unbelievably supported and invested in as a person and an artist, and that is hard to find, especially in a theater program. I am so thankful that I found PTC.”

The Emerging Student Theater Artists (ESTA) group on campus has big plans for the fall semester.
Senior musical theatre major, Isabelle Rutens, said the group has three shows planned for the current semester, including a musical rendition of “Cats,” (coined as “Katz” by the group) by Andrew Lloyd Webber, a night of one act shows, and “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson.” There will also be several improv shows that will be performed by ESTA’s own improv group. The improvisational group, “No Control,” was started in 2015. Rutens said they will be doing plays for Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas in addition to the other shows.
Jack Mannion, a sophomore musical theater major, has worked with the group for two years. What makes ESTA stand out is that it allows students to stage and direct plays that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to do, as well as take existing shows and remake them in their own style. “Katz” is one of the shows the group adapted. The group’s members were elated to hear that they would be doing it.
“Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” will also be remade in a new style. Erica Henning, a sophomore musical theater major, is a member of ESTA and is the director for “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson.” She made it more immersive than the original. The play was originally made to incorporate only the actors, however Henning has changed it so that the audience can be a part of the play.
ESTA’s shows will be performed in the Rifle Range Theatre. The one act plays will be on Oct. 10 at 9 p.m., “No Control” will be performed on Oct. 10 at 9 p.m. and “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” will be on Nov. 3 at 10 p.m.

Critically acclaimed jazz artist Jon Batiste will take the Krasnoff Theater stage (formerly the Hillwood Recital Hall) to treat showgoers to a night of both his original compositions and American standards on Friday, Sept. 28.
Batiste will promote his forthcoming album “Hollywood Africans,” which is set to be released on the day of the performance. The album includes classics such as “Saint James Infirmary,” “Smile,” “The Very Thought of You,” and “What a Wonderful World” by Louis Armstrong. Batiste plans to take his listeners from “the early jazz of New Orleans to the present day” within his new album, guaranteeing an exciting night for the audience.
Some will know Batiste from “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” as the leader of the house-band Stay Human. Stay Human has performed alongside several famous musicians such as Long Island legend Billy Joel and Pulitzer Prize winner Wynton Marsalis.
For his debut solo album, Batiste collaborated with producer T Bone Burnett, who has worked with numerous artists and film soundtracks. Additionally, Burnett’s work for the film soundtrack “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” won album of the year at the Grammy Awards.
According to his official website, Batiste wanted the collaboration to create a sound that both he and Burnett would feel was authentic. In the end they were able to create an album that Batiste considers to be a personal, stripped-down version of who he is. The album also encompasses the musicians and performers that have inspired him throughout his life.
Batiste has many accolades of his own. In 2016, he was featured on Forbes 30 Under 30 music list, and in 2017 received the American Jazz Museum Lifetime Achievement Award and the Harry Chapin ASCAP Humanitarian Award. Batiste also serves as the Music Director of The Atlantic and the Creative Director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem. He plays a variety of instruments including the piano, voice, melodica, electric bass and Hammond organ.
In his performance and on his upcoming solo album, Batiste hopes to demonstrate an intimate side of himself. In addition to creating a personal and sentimental environment for all his listeners, whether they see him live or just listen to his recorded album. It is also important for him to showcase his cultural heritage within his mix of American standards and original compositions.
Batiste further notes that he wants people to feel a variety of emotions when they hear his new album. He wants listeners to remember the black heroes of our world and the legacy that they have left behind. From smiles, laughs, to tears Batiste hopes that all his listeners feel a variety of emotions when listening to “Hollywood Africans.”
Tickets can be brought at the Tilles Center box office for $55 and $15 with a valid student ID.

Melissa Etheridge is bringing her “Yes I Am” album tour to the Tilles Center this fall. Etheridge kicked off her tour at the Fox Tucson Theatre in Arizona on Sunday, Sept. 16, and will be coming to Tilles on Sunday, Oct. 7.
The tour marks the 30th anniversary of her first album release. Since then, Etheridge has 14 completed albums, five of which are platinum, and she landed six singles on Billboard’s Top 40. In 2004, she placed her music career on hold to successfully battle breast cancer, which motivated her involvement in cancer awareness for women. Etheridge is an openly gay female using her fame to advocate for the LGBTQ community. Her success won her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
“Never heard of her, is she a singer?” asked Hugh Fraser, a student at Post. He may be one of many in his generation to share in this unfamiliarity.
However, others on campus are familiar with Etheridge. “She’s got kind of a rock-folk sound,” Dan Cox, director of broadcasting at WCWP Radio, said.
The singer/songwriter’s career reached its peak when MTV still played music videos. She thrived through a decade of music filled with boy-bands and grunge.
“There’s a song of hers I really like, it’s from the 90’s, called ‘I Want to Come Over,’” Jeff Kroll, an LIU alumnus (’75) who works at WCWP, said.
If “I Want to Come Over” doesn’t ring a bell, Etheridge’s top selling single, “Come to My Window,” might.
“Fans should expect an amazing show,” Brianna Cravatzo, a fan who attended the show in Arizona, said. “I noticed a lot of places she is going [on tour] seem to be smaller venues. I think she’s getting back to her roots so you get a more intimate show,” she said.
Fans on Long Island can expect a similar experience in a smaller venue such as the Tilles Center. The theater seats approximately 2,250 people, guaranteeing anyone in the audience the chance to get a good view of the performance.
Cravatzo believes performing in an intimate setting is the best way for Etheridge to celebrate her success. “She [Etheridge] thanked us all,” Cravatzo said. “She is aware [that] without her fans, she wouldn’t be where she is today. I love that about her.”

The fifth film in “The Conjuring” series, “The Nun” made quite an impact on its opening weekend Sept. 6. “The Nun” had one of the highest domestic box office opening weekends, bringing in $53.5 million, making it one of “The Conjuring” franchise’s best openings thus far. With a budget of only $22 million, it is steadily exceeding expectations.
With some returning cast members from the other movies in “The Conjuring” series and a vast amount of new faces, many of these actors are not new to the horror genre. This is the first of “The Conjuring” installments directed by Corin Hardy. The leading nun, Sister Irene, is played by Taissa Farmiga, a regular member of the “American Horror Story” franchise. She brings some of that expert suspenseful acting to the big screen.
The premise of the movie starts when a young Romanian nun takes her own life to out run some unspeakable evil. A priest with a twisted past and a novitiate on the verge of her final vows are sent to Romania by the Vatican to investigate the unsettling death. Together they uncover the mysteries plaguing the Abbey. They risk not only their lives, but their souls to confront an evil power in the form of a demonic Nun.
If you are into classic horror then this film is right up your alley. Freshman Philisha Renwick walked into the theater with high expectations after having seen the previous installments of “The Conjuring” series.
“The Nun was a great movie. Some of the scenes were scary, it made me jump out of my seat,” Renwick said. Senior Ej Nweke had nothing more to say than “the movie was lit.”
“The Nun’s” frightening and jump worthy scenes will leave you gasping for your next breath. This horror, along with with dark run arounds and nerve scraping sound effects, will leave you having less than holy nightmares.

In the “Legend of Zelda” universe, the Triforce symbol is the most powerful artifact of the game. What people may not know is that this sacred treasure also symbolizes the “The Holy Trinity” in Christianity.
Right from the start of the game, the opening credits tell us that “the prince of darkness Gannon has stolen the triforce of power.” The other being who shares the title of “Prince of Darkness” is Satan. More references come in the form of in-game items, such as the Bible, and a shield with a cross on it.
In “Legend of Zelda 2,” players will see crosses almost everywhere. They’re present on tombstones, in dungeons and on churches.
In “Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,” the character Link makes the Catholic sign of the cross and then kneels to pray in order to open the Desert Temple gates.
We learn in “Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time” that Din, the goddess of power, used her power of fire to create the land. This could be a reference of how in the Bible, God, “The Father,” created the land and appeared to his followers as a ball of fire.
Next comes Nayru, the goddess of wisdom who used her power to bring law to the land.
This may be interpreted as a reference to Jesus, “The Son,” whose sole purpose on earth was to proclaim the law of God.
Finally, there is Farore, the goddess of courage and her connection to the “Holy Ghost.” Both Farore and the “Holy Ghost” give the gift of spirit to the world the ensure an eternal rebirth. The other connection Farore has to the “Holy Ghost” is her power of wind. Some have described the “Holy Ghost” they describe it as something similar to wind a presence one can feel but not see.
The last connection Farore has to the “Holy Ghost” is her title “Goddess of Courage.” This is especially important because in Christianity, the “Holy Ghost” gives believers the courage needed to move forward.
With all these connections it’s hard to doubt that the creators “Legend of Zelda” took inspiration from Christianity. I hope that I have inspired some of you to learn more about the games you love so much.

I remember the day I wanted to be a commuter. I told myself I wanted to be as far away from everything as possible and have the experience of someone who went to a CUNY (city university).
It’s my last year, and I can honestly say I’ve had a college experience different from the movie stereotype. People tend to look at a commuter’s college experience as the equivalent of eating a salad without avocados. It’s the type of story your co-worker tells, running her mouth about how she hustled even though she still works in retail.
Commuting gives you the best of both worlds: hanging out with your friends and having your own shower. It’s a great moment when you step onto something gross in your tub, squirm and realize, “Wait, that’s my hair, it’s fine, we’re OK.”
I am not a rich man. I take two buses to get home to Flushing, and I’ve had my share of frustration with the MTA’s service – I see why they give the announcement that assaulting workers is a felony.
Here’s the thing, I found that my best and most unique experiences in college were when I missed the last bus or when I had nothing to do and stayed late on campus.
Commuters are always in a hurry to get out. We have stuff to do off-campus, but we also have life to live on-campus.
For me, this was the one time I got to party full-out. Drinking and talking about nothing, laughing and wondering if you might be gay – that’s college. You don’t get that if you make it before rush hour. So let’s make this year the best one yet, while we also keep our own shower.

As college students, cognitive health and preservation may be the last things on our minds – no pun intended – but maybe it shouldn’t be. As we age, our bodies and brains function less efficiently and begin requiring more nourishing foods and more substantial interactions and activities in order to maintain their youthful qualities. According to the Mayo Clinic, it’s important to begin preserving brain cells and engaging in activities that promote their growth as soon as possible.

Research has shown that spending time with friends and family stimulates neurons and promotes regeneration of brain cells, since stimulating conversation and talking about new things everyday pushes the brain to expand its’ horizons. Other recommended activities include exercising on a regular basis. The National Center for Biotechnology Information encourages physical activity, since it increases blood flow to the brain, delivering more oxygen and nutrients as well as discouraging the formation of blood clots.
With Alzheimer’s disease affecting one in ten people (according to the World Health Organization) and with 7 percent of American’s developing mild cognitive decline annually, it’s better to start engaging in brain preserving activities and avoiding harmful ones as soon as possible. As enticing as drinking may be, especially in college, alcohol is one of the most common ways people negatively impact cognitive function. Studies show that frequent drinkers have decreased brain volume and reduced neurological function.
The National Institute of Health published an article in 2017 concluding that interacting with new people, volunteering for new things and making time to learn a new skill or hobby are the most effective ways to not only keep your mind active, but to increase your quality of life. The saying “life is too short to live the same day twice” is a perfect reflection and should help guide us into the future and lead us in our endeavors.

To be mindful is to be mentally present and focused on what is going on around you in the moment. Many people, like myself, don’t stop to appreciate the in-between moments; we are too mentally checked- out to stop and smell the roses.

Recently I have been trying to be more conscious of where I am, what I am doing and what I am feeling, either physically or emotionally. I get very anxious and worked up about what I am going to do with my life and where I will be in five years, when in reality that doesn’t matter unless I am here in the now.
All I want to do is work at my dream job and not get ready to start school again. This causes me to stress out and go into panic mode. When I get like this all I have to do is stop and be mindful.
Take a second to look around – where are you? Is anyone with you? Is it loud? Are you sitting or standing? If you’re outside, is it cold? Become aware of what you are feeling physically, the textures and the temperature around you. What do you smell? Do you hear anything?
Focus on this mentality. Are you happy with your surroundings? How does the feature of what is in your hands make you feel emotionally? Become aware of your five senses.
Practicing mindfulness allows you to take your running thoughts and focus them on what is going on in your current environment. You can practice being mindful of your body, which can help you move around more. If you are exercising be mindful of your body getting stronger. Bringing awareness to these things can help you better yourself.
Overall being mindful can help with your every- day life. It keeps you focused on your goals without overwhelming you with what is to come. It allows you to notice and appreciate what is going on around you in the present. Take yourself out of autopilot and don’t let life pass you by.

Unless you’re a diehard Pioneer athletics fan, you wouldn’t be aware of the app available for the Pioneer community to follow their favorite sports teams. Available on both android and iOS, the LIU Post Pioneers app was updated summer 2018 with a new design and more personalized features.
These changes came with the arrival of new director of athletic media relations, Casey Schermick, spring 2018. There was a massive revamp to the sports social media in January 2018.
“I wanted to put my own spin on things,” Schermick said. His intentions were to give each sport more equal coverage and the updates to the app are the latest efforts in achieving this goal.
With its new look and user friendly nature, students, athletes and even their eying rivals are able to track all the Pioneers’ successes. “It’s got all the schedules, notifications, links to the stats, the videos, the results and everything all in one place,” Schermick said.
The app has great popularity among the athletic community, as they track their own game stats, and cheer on their fellow Pioneers.
Swim team alumna Elin Kvarnemar raved about the updates to the app. “It’s great, having the notifications was always good, but now I can select the events I want to follow and follow the live score boards even though I’m miles away,” Kvarnemar said.
Junior women’s soccer captain and political science major Gabby Clark also highlights the success of the app. “It makes the community closer,” Clark said. “When five or six teams are playing at the same time, often in different states, it makes it easier to track how the pioneer athletic community is doing.”
This renovation comes as part of Schermick and his teams mission to brand the school to the highest marketable level. “The goal is definitely to put out a product that competes with the highest level division 2 and even some of the division 1 schools,” he said. “Just because we have the label of division 2 doesn’t mean we have to hold ourselves to that standard.”

School has just begun, and our school’s pep teams are already preparing for the sports season ahead. Students may have seen the LIU cheer and dance teams before at sporting events, cheering on our players and exciting the crowds for the big games. This year, however, the students are in for a big surprise.
The two teams joined together for Spirit Day on Saturday, Sept. 22 and Sunday, Sept 23. Children from the ages of five to fourteen were invited to attend a day of learning sideline routines, stunts and cheers. Participants from Spirit Day are welcome to join the cheer and dance teams during their homecoming performances on October [date], including the half-time show.
Kaela Steinbrenner, a freshman on the dance team, aided in Spirit Day. The dance team prepared two routines to perform at the pep rally and during the game. “We’ve also been working out and practicing our sideline routines and cheers so that we are totally ready to hype up our fellow Pioneers,” she added.
The dance and cheer teams have not yet practiced together as both teams are solidifying their individual routines, but they will be working together soon according to Kayla.
The cheer team has adapted a new routine for the homecoming game and are working towards some new goals for this season.
Skylar Byram, cheer team head coach who joined in August, has a new style to introduce to the team. “We’re doing things a bit different from last year,” she said.
The cheer team recently switched from the NCA to the UCA conference, which hosts their nationals event at Disney World in January. The NCA conference championships were hosted in April of last year, so the switch to UCA has the cheer team on their toes, as they have less time to prepare for nationals. The team’s goal is to make finals at nationals and place in the top five.
The team is not only preparing game day routines for the football and basketball games, adding volleyball games to their schedule.
The cheer team has much in store for homecoming. They are working on involving more alumni at the game and created t-shirts to be sold during common hour in the days leading up to it.

The smell of manure, blood, sweat and tears were in the air at the North Shore stables, and Katherine Galvin, a junior nursing major, was right around the corner talking to her teammates.

Galvin is one of the 35 members of the varsity equestrian team and competes in horse shows throughout the year. She is regarded by her teammates as one of the hardest working members, balancing school, work and her love of horses.
“She’s a huge part of our team, and honestly I don’t know how things would stay organized without her,” Sarah Wung, a sophomore journalism major who is a member of the team, said.
The horses seem to like Galvin too, as one licked her hand as she approached to interact with him.
“She’s awesome, she’s great,” varsity coach Brooke Chasin said about Galvin.
Galvin started riding at Post as a freshman in fall 2016. “The varsity riding team here was a huge factor for me in my decision to come to Post,” she said.
She has ridden horses for most of her life. “I started riding when I was 7 and haven’t been out of the saddle since. Horses have just always been an integral part of my life,” she said.
“If I had to choose, my favorite part about riding is the relationship you form with your horse. I really enjoy working with ‘project’ horses (horses that aren’t fully trained or need work). It is rewarding once all the hard work pays off and the horse is able to perform at his potential,” Galvin said.
The equestrian team is unique in that each team member plays for their own score. Not all events or section of the competition require jumping, some events called floating events are done on the ground. The team with the highest score wins.
The score in a competition is determined by these general premises: horsemanship or how well the rider works with the horse, posture of the rider and how well the rider guides the horse to perform certain tasks such as turning.
While they may compete individually, Galvin is still a team player. She works as the team’s barn manager.
“I oversee the care of all 30 team horses. Each girl on the team has their very own ‘care horse’ to care for,” she said. “My job is to ensure that each horse is receiving the proper maintenance from their care person.”
Taking care of the care horse includes grooming, exercising, schooling, lunging (commands while guiding the horse in a controlled circle before riding), and several other tasks. Each member of the varsity team comes down to the stables daily to take care of their horses.
When Galvin is not at the stables or in school hitting the books, she spends her time in the yoga studio being an “Avid Yogi Namaste.”

Karis Fuller, a senior sociology major and arts & entertainment editor for The Pioneer, is ready to get back in the pool after separating her shoulder last season.
Fuller’s shoulder injury was caused by constant use. While suffering from her injury last year, Fuller was still able to finish in eighth place at the NCAA Division II 100-yard backstroke and set the fourth fastest time in Division II history. Fuller was also named College Swimming College Conference Swimmer of the Week three times in one season.
 
Last summer, Fuller did not undergo surgery on her shoulder, opting for electro shock therapy instead.
“My shoulder is only 90 percent better one percent of the time,” Fuller said. Having been treated, she can now get back in the gym to do cardio exercise.
Coming into the 2018-2019 school year, Fuller kept her personal expectations high.
“I’m expecting my performance to be bigger and better,” she said. “I came into college saying that I wanted to be a national champion and I’ve only got one shot left as a senior.”
