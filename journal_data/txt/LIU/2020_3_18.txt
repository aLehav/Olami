The women’s lacrosse team fell to the La Salle University Explorers 6-18 on Saturday, March 7.
Despite solid performances from senior Paige Sherlock and senior Alyssa Mallery, who both scored twice, La Salle walked away with the victory.
La Salle took the lead early and held onto it. They went on a four-goal run leading the first half, and maintained a point gap throughout the rest of the game.
Sherlock and junior Amanda Masullo had the first two shots on net for the Sharks, but both were saved. Senior Bianca Santucci got the Sharks on the board and broke up the Explorers’ run when she scored on a free position attempt.
Sherlock brought the Sharks within three goals from La Salle when she scored on a pass from freshman Francesca Vasile-Cozzo. However, La Salle scored three more times before the end of the opening half.
Vasile-Cozzo connected once again with Sherlock early in the second half. Mallery scored her first goal of the game on a free position attempt in the second half.
After La Salle added to their lead in the second half achieving a 4-17 score with 20 minutes to play, junior Rachel Masullo connected with her sister, Amanda, to earn the Sharks their fifth goal of the day.
Mallery scored the last goal of the game and brought the score to 6-18 after senior Sara Stephens passed to her on a free position attempt.
Besides solid individual performances by Sherlock and Mallery, Vasile-Cozzo finished with a team-best two assists. Amanda Masullo and Santucci both scored ones, and Rachel Masullo and Stephens both had one assist each. Sophomore Hailey Duchnowski made eight saves in net for the Sharks.

Sharks baseball team scored their first win of the season. Freshman Richie LaCalandra scored three goals and added four assists, and the Sharks defeated Quinnipiac University with a score of 13-9 for their first win on Saturday, March 7.
“I’m happy for our guys, they needed this win. They work really hard and have proven to be a resilient bunch,” Head Coach Eric Wolf said.
The Sharks took advantage early in the game on a man-up opportunity when junior Will Snelders scored in the first minute of the game. The Quinnipiac Bobcats responded with a goal and cut the score deficit to one goal after LaCalandra put the Sharks up by two, but that was the closest Quinnipiac came to catching the Sharks.
Senior Nick Grassa kicked off a three-goal run for the Sharks when he found the back of the net twice within 20 seconds into the second quarter. LaCalandra then scored twice before the end of the first quarter.
The Bobcats answered shortly after and got within three goals of the Sharks. However, Snelders scored once again and the Sharks regained a four-goal lead late in the second quarter.
Quinnipiac continued to pressure and scored once more in the first half, but the Sharks responded twice as Grassa capped a hat trick, and freshman Sean Boll scored with just under two minutes left in the half.
In the third quarter, Quinnipiac would be the first team to score, but Grassa responded with his fourth goal of the day. The Bobcats scored once more in the third quarter, but the Sharks were able to add to their lead as sophomore Jake Gillis and LaCalandra both scored in the final three minutes of the quarter to make the score 12-6 in favor of the Sharks.
In the fourth quarter, the Bobcats managed to score three more goals. However, freshman Will Mark made nine saves and together with a goal from sophomore Doug Chase, the Sharks sealed their first victory of the season.
LaCalandra led the way for the Sharks in this game with a season high of seven points. Grassa also showed skill with four goals and one assist. Snelders and Gillis both scored twice while Boll and Chase added one goal each.
On the defensive side of things, Mark earned his first collegiate victory in net, making 16 saves–three away from tying his career-high statistics.

The sculpture gallery hosted the art of Madelynne Ehmer, a senior art education major, from Monday, March 2 to Friday, March 6. Her collection was titled “Don’t be Afraid” and was based around common phobias people face around the world.
Ehmer was previously in group shows in the Student Art League Gallery, but this was her first solo show. Being able to showcase her work as an individual allowed Ehmer to take a deeper focus on her work.
“Working with someone else, you have to make sure your pieces go together, so this is just your ideas and gathering all of your stuff,” she said.
“Don’t be Afraid” is based around one specific idea, not one specific art type. The collection is made up of pieces of different mediums, some being photographs, something Ehmer did purposefully.
“I’m always doing different things with different stuff, just seeing what I can make,” she said.
The artist hoped to capture a feeling in each of her pieces that gave the viewers a feeling of discomfort while also being entranced by the work.
“The art comes with the chills, there are so many different formats that all get an emotional reaction out of you,” Miguel Castro, a friend of Ehmer’s, said.
The gallery featured many common phobias, and some that may be lesser-known which still made the faces of visitors around the room cringe in discomfort.
Ehmer felt the inspiration for this collection after creating one of the pieces displayed in the gallery.
“I came in with a smaller print of [“Bubbles”] one day, all happy, and someone said “Oh I feel like I’m drowning when I look at that.’ So I was like ‘oh, okay,’” she said.
Ehmer went on to recreate the piece on a larger scale for the gallery. “I wanted the viewer to really be able to submerge themselves and really be in the water,” Ehmer said.
While the thought of drowning drew Ehmer in, she also credited the inspiration of the collection to her love of bugs.
“I like looking at them, and seeing all the little pieces that make them up, all the colors in it, and appreciating the little things that people just see a bug and scream,” Ehmer said.
The chilling collection wasn’t something someone could catch in a quick glance. Each piece, regardless of the medium, was more than just art on the surface.
“You always keep on finding more. Whether it’s the shadow or the illusion of someone being there, and then you realize the topic is ghosts… there’s a lot in each piece,” Castro said.
To check out Ehmer’s take on phobias and to see more of her art, students can find her on instagram @_madart.

Students who enjoy listening to classical music were in for a treat on Tuesday, March 3. Siblings Eugene and Tatiana Feigin are a musical duo who have been performing side-by-side since the age of seven. This is the first time they have performed on campus since 2018, though they have performed in the Great Hall numerous times in the past.
As the Feigin siblings got ready for their evening performance, Eugene remarked on how the performance was extra special this time. The pair of siblings played two pieces. With Eugene on piano and Tatiana on violin, they performed Beethoven’s Violin Sonata No.5 in F major, “Opus 24,” the Sonata published in 1801 is also often known as ‘Spring Sonata.’ The second piece was what the siblings say makes this specific performance special. The duo played “Sonata No. 2” by the English composer Fredrick Delius.
“The first piece we’ve actually recorded. We have it on CD. We have played it many times,” Mr. Feigin said. “We played it in Europe, we played it here. But this second piece is almost never played.”
“Delius was very famous once, in England and Germany especially. There are hundreds of composers that just disappear. I don’t know why because it’s very beautiful music.” Eugene said.
Fredrick Theodore Albert Delius composed “Sonata No. 2” and several other pieces, and he was known as one of the most renowned individuals in the revival of English music at the end of the 19th century.
The admiration that the Feigin have for the pieces as well as their composers came through in their passionate performance. Those who attended got the opportunity to share their appreciation for the music.

The Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC), planned to host a program fundraiser prior to campus-wide event cancellations. The event’s goal would have been to raise money for the company, which involves all 15 of the dance majors on campus.
The event was originally going to take place at the Pratt Recreation Center in the multipurpose room on March 24 at 7 p.m.
“The event is called PCDC Challenge… In the future, we will be having more fundraisers for PCDC. Keep on the lookout,” Kaitlyn Jones, a senior dance major, said. “Unfortunately it would not be happening any longer. Pratt is currently closed, and they do not know when they will open again. So, we will not be having this fundraiser anymore.”
Sabrina Greig, a sophomore dance major, had a role in planning the event. “We haven’t done this one in particular in the past, and I know that we plan on having more fundraisers to come after this in the near future,” she said.
Earlier in the spring 2020 semester, students in the dance program held a bake sale and raised about $150 for their attire.
“We’re currently undecided what the money will be used for for this fundraiser,” Greig said.
Participants at the fundraiser would have learned simple choreography from the dance majors.
“People who donate and want to dance with us will be included in the dances if they wish to do so, and we will teach them the steps in order for them to keep up with us,” Greig said, “I think that whoever participates in that particular activity will really enjoy it and see all the hard work that we put in as dance majors. It’s good times and brings us together as a community.”
Claudia Turczynska, a junior majoring in accounting, attended one of the dance program’s fundraisers in the past; however, with the current suspension of classes due to precautions surrounding COVID-19, she’s upset she can’t attend the fundraiser.
“With classes being switched to online, I’m staying inside and away from the virus, so I won’t be attending this event anymore unfortunately,” she said.

A special exhibition in the Student Art League Gallery (SAL) showcased student work in a collection called “Hua Quan 2019,” from Tuesday, Feb. 25 to Sunday, March 9.
The works reflected the trip current students and alumni made to the Hua Quan Art Village in Nanchang, China. The artists were invited on the trip for a cultural exchange with the local village and high school in the Nanchang area.
Each artist created works based off of their time in Hua Quan and submitted it for the exhibition. There were over 30 pieces in the show that truly symbolize the personal experience of each artist and their time spent in Hua Quan.
“No two pieces in the show are alike, showing each individual artist’s style, as well as their unique experiences abroad. While on the trip, artists were invited to gallery openings and open studios of local artists, to truly experience art across the world,” Susan Kelly, exhibition coordinator, said. “During the trip, the artists collaborated with the local high school to create a mural that linked each individual. Here the only shared language came from a paintbrush.”
Lauren Bourguet, an MFA student graduating in spring 2020, said: “The gallery exhibition is about a trip we took to the Huan Quan art village last May. It was an artist retreat. We did many cultural activities during our stay, such as Kung Fu lessons from a Shaolin, yoga, learning the ancient art of Chinese paintings from a master painter using bamboo brushes, Chinese ink, rice paper, and the special methods in which to use them, calligraphy, and a tour of the Longhu Mountains, the famous birthplace of the Tao Religion.”

While abroad, student artists also had the opportunity to create oil and acrylic paintings, attend an art exhibit opening and tour a museum featuring 100 murals by international artists, including work by Seung Lee, professor of art. They also took a pottery class with local clay and worked alongside high schoolers to create murals for their school. The artists also got to experience Chinese culture by attending a traditional tea ceremony and learning how to make dumplings.
“I personally was very inspired by the Longhu Mountain. After arriving stateside, I immediately got to work on a large-scale oil painting,” Bourguet said.
“We all bonded over this trip by all being artists and giving back to the village community. Now we’re back here and get to show how this experience has impacted and influenced us in a positive way,” Emily Halper, an MFA student, said.
Jamie LaSota, an MFA student, displayed four paintings. “My inspiration was location, and I love painting about nature and all the places I’ve traveled. This experience was unbelievable. One painting is the first view that we woke up to every day,” she said.
Melinda DiGiovana, an MFA student, showed three photographs at the exhibition that she found inspirational.
“The whole experience was breathtaking. One picture was an incredible light show that we had experienced, that was insane. It felt like Disney World. It was one of the most beautiful moments for me,” she said.

Theta Chi hosted a Silent Disco on March 5 to fundraise for the United Service Organization. At the event, participants danced to various music playing through their individual headphones.
The United Service Organizations Inc. is an American nonprofit-charitable corporation that provides live entertainment including comedians, actors and musicians and more to members of the United States Armed Forces and their families.
“This is our third year doing this…our success rate really varies year to year. Last year was pretty successful, we had a bit of a rocky go with it because we were supposed to have it on the patio on top of Hillwood and it was raining that day, so it was really hectic too,” Dylan Radcliffe, a sophomore marketing major and member of Theta Chi, said.
The fraternity also accepted donations from those who wanted to show support, but weren’t able to attend the event.
“Overall it’s been pretty satisfactory and the ticket sales are pretty nice, especially when people come around, even if they can’t come, they still like to donate and get involved and it’s pretty good,” Radcliffe said.

Logan Kelley, a sophomore musical theatre major, came to the event to support her boyfriend and the cause. She also enjoyed the social atmosphere of the event.
“[The night] has been pretty good, lots of fun. I’ve gotten to meet someone who I probably would’ve never met before if I hadn’t come to the event,” Kelley said.
Some of the silent disco’s attendees had similar experiences to Kelley’s. Lauren Medina, a graduate student studying cyber analytics and criminal justice, said, “The best part of why I’m here is so I can see people who I haven’t seen in a very long time.”
Medina was pleasantly surprised to see the event’s generous turnout. “It’s so cool how many people are actually coming through for the event, especially right before spring break. We were expecting everyone to be home, but they decided to stay to be here. That’s so dope,” Medina said.

Three select students from the music department attended the College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) Conference held from Feb. 21 to 24 at Temple University in Philadelphia where they performed in the Eastern Division Intercollegiate Band.
CBDNA is devoted to the teaching, performance, study and cultivation of music with a particular focus on the wind band medium. It’s an inclusive organization that seeks individual and collective growth as musicians.
The students chosen to participate in the Eastern Division Conference were junior clarinetist Jaclyn Smith, senior percussionist Melissa Migliano and french horn player Alexandra Muller.
The intercollegiate band is an opportunity for students to play with a fine ensemble, experience new repertoire and expand their professional networks. The Eastern region excompasses members in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C.

At the event, there are multiple performances played by university students from the Greater Atlantic and New England regions. Each student must be selected by a panel from the CBDNA through audition tapes.
Melissa Migliano, a music education major, has played percussion for about 13 years. “I was super excited and a little bit shocked when I was selected to play at the CBDNA conference,” she said.
Migliano was honored to know she was chosen to sit as the principal percussionist for the band. “This was a really fun and valuable experience and I’m really glad I was able to participate.”
Smith, a junior instrumental performance major, has played the clarinet for the past 11 years. Smith described the intercollegiate band as extremely talented, reminding her that all of her hard work pays off.
“Every musician was very talented, making it very competitive to claim a spot,” Smith said. “I was so excited to find out that I was accepted.”

Students wishing to share their music with a wider audience might have their chance as Deep End Entertainment Productions joins the campus community.
Deep End Entertainment Productions is a record label that will exclusively sign students on campus. This will give students an opportunity to record their original music, distribute it on a digital platform and market it both on and off campus.
The idea to start an on campus record label came out of a new undergraduate major, the Music Technology, Entrepreneurship & Production (MTEP) program. The MTEP program teaches students to create, produce and market their own music, according to Jeffrey Lederer, the director of jazz studies and coordinator of the MTEP program.
Funding for Deep End Entertainment Productions was donated by a Post alumni. Domenick Propati wanted to contribute to a student entrepreneurial project in the arts, and donated after he was presented with the idea for Deep End Entertainment Products.
In addition to featuring student artists only, the label is also run by students. Students are in charge of recruiting artists, creating contracts for them to sign and advertising the projects that the label is working on.
Lederer said that Deep End Entertainment Productions is ran similarly to how other record labels operate.
“We’re doing a school project but everything we are doing is what actually happens in the real world,” he said.
On Monday, March 9, and Tuesday, March 10, student musicians went to Cove City Sound Studios to record songs for the label’s debut album. The studio is features professional recording equipment and instruments, and previously hosted famous musicians such as Whitney Houston, Billy Joel and Jennifer Lopez.
Kelly Montenero, senior arts management major, and Kat Montenero, a sophomore attending Five Towns College, better known as “Kelly & Kat,” recorded “Get Out of my Head.” The song is about trying to move on when you can’t stop thinking about someone.
Kat Montenero wrote the song with simple lyrics, but wanted to express the complexity of the situation through other means.
“The technicality behind it comes in with the guitar and the harmonies, so it was definitely fun to write, just like a lighthearted moving on song,” she said.
Senior vocal performance major, Amanda Jean-Louis, recorded a song called “Can’t Replace You.”
“It’s not about anyone specific, but it’s a song written from the point of view of someone who is sad over the love of their life moving on after they’ve broken up,” Jean-Louis said. “They’re reminiscing on the good times they had together and wishes so badly that they could go back.”
Nicholas Barone, junior MTEP major, recorded a song that featured no lyrics and was made up almost entirely of his trumpet playing. A drum track was added on to the song which was a last minute decision during the recording session.
The musicians were both enthusiastic and anxious to be able to record in a professional studio.
“It was honestly a lot of nervous excitement because I was excited but at the same time I was like ‘oh my gosh this is actually happening’,” Jean-Louis said. “I was trying to just hype myself up, but not freak out because I’ve never done it before.”
Some musicians also described the recording process as feeling different from when they normally perform.
“It’s like a different energy,” Kat said. “Since it’s going to be there forever you want the most emotion that you can have at that moment.”
Kat also described the recording process as being similar to an actor on a movie set. Once the director yells “action,” the actors need to get into character, the same way musicians need to prepare when they are about to record.
Some of the student musicians have recorded in professional studios in the past, but for some of them, this opportunity offered an exciting new experience.
“It was a dream come true,” Jean-Louis said. “If you asked me a year ago if I would be doing this, I wouldn’t have said yes because I had no idea. I want to pursue a career not only in performance but songwriting as well, so the fact that we have this opportunity is really big and really special to me.”
Deep End Entertainment Productions’ debut album will be released on music streaming platforms in April. Students interested in the album, or any future work by the label, can follow them on Instagram @DeepEndEntertainmentProduction or email them at deependentertainmentproduction@gmail.com.

Students who use the occasionally faulty MyLIU mobile application to access their school email and online courses, received an abundance of unexpected Blackboard push notifications on Friday, March 6, five days before the school alerted the community that classes would move online due to the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
In a crisis situation with unforeseen circumstances such as COVID-19, easy access to school email and Blackboard on a mobile device becomes essential. In precaution and forethought of a worse-case scenario, The Pioneer began an attempt on Feb. 27 to report on the app’s technical difficulties mentioned by some students.
“I don’t use the app because it’s never worked for me,” Claudia Turczynska, a junior accounting major, said. “I always had difficulty using the app for various reasons, like receiving emails, so I only use my computer to go on to the school website and to check my mail. I make sure to bring my laptop with me to school daily to avoid the issue of using the app.”
The Pioneer initially reached out to the Information Technology Department (IT) to ask questions about how often the MyLIU app is updated, who students can contact for assistance with the app, and how students can receive alerts on their mobile devices when a new email is received.
“We cannot directly answer any questions,” a member of IT said in an email response on Feb. 27. “To get your questions answered you will need to reach out to the dean of students with them.”
Immediately following IT’s direction, The Pioneer reached out to Dean of Students Michael Berthel for answers. He replied that he would work with IT but may have difficulty getting the department to respond by the requested deadline. Understanding the quick turnaround request, The Pioneer extended the deadline into the following week.
After not hearing back from Berthel, The Pioneer sent him a follow up email on March 2, and again on March 6, the day before students and faculty would break for spring vacation. The dean emailed the LIU community just seven hours later with a COVID-19 update, advising those with plans to travel internationally be mindful of the potential risk of disruption to their ability to reenter the country. The email also addressed the required 14-day self-quarantine for anyone returning to campus from an area designated as Level 3 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC.)
But for some who say they can’t receive emails or email alerts on their mobile devices, important updates which require immediate attention can potentially go unnoticed, especially during a time such as spring break when students and faculty don’t necessarily check their email regularly.
Access to email through the MyLIU app stopped working for some at the start of the spring 2020 semester, which is also when the CDC began to confirm cases of COVID-19 in the United States.
Daryl Miller, an accounting major who transferred from Post to Nassau Community College last semester, said she consistently had issues when she used the MyLIU app.
“I wasn’t able to get in touch with my math professor to let her know that I would be late for class one day due to traffic because the app wouldn’t take me to the email section, so I had to wait until I had access to a computer to contact her,” she said.
A survey conducted through Instagram on March 11 revealed that 90 percent of students polled had received a blast of Blackboard notifications on March 6, some of which were for courses taken in previous semesters. This indicated to some that the school was preparing to move classes online, which presented another complaint among some students – the quality of WiFi on campus.
“I find LIU’s internet and WiFi to be atrocious,” Justin Simon, a senior business administration major, said.
Berthel and President Kimberly Cline each sent out an email on March 11 alerting the campus community that instruction would be moved online effective Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 27. Berthel sent another email later that day which stated a member of the LIU community, whose office is in the Pell Hall Life Sciences building, tested positive for the coronavirus. The school then followed with a mass text message the following day which said the university decided that all online instruction would extend until the end of the spring 2020 semester.
As of Monday, March 17, The Pioneer has yet to receive a response from Berthel or the IT department, but all links on the mobile version of the MyLIU app are not working.
“When it comes to their app, it’s a disaster and a disappointment. I stopped using the app a while ago because of the technical difficulties,” Simon said.
Update: The links on the MyLIU mobile app began working again as of March 24, 2020.

The arts management program was “frozen” as of March 3, adding to the list of various other liberal arts and science programs that recently faced cuts. Professors within the department were notified not by university officials, but by their own students.
David Apichell, an adjunct professor of theatre, was in Kentucky at a theatre conference when distraught students called to give him the news.
“One day there was a program, one day there was not,” he said. “No notice, no warning.”
Freshman arts management major Jillian Sajda was told through word-of-mouth by other students in the program.
“I was just shocked,” Sajda said. “I couldn’t believe it.”
Apichell wasn’t certain why the program was cut, but said the program “shouldn’t be too generous in its acceptance rate.” He wished those who decided to freeze the program made a real attempt to observe a class or two, in order to see what the program’s professors and students were working on.
“It saddens me because it seems that someone thinks that the arts don’t need to be managed and they’d be very, very wrong,” Apichell said. “My hope is that [the university] continues the classes, but I’ve also begun to accept disappointment when dealing with these matters.”
The students are allowed to complete their degree at LIU, but some debate on whether transferring to another university will bring them better opportunities.
“In my college search, I really wanted to go to a school that offered art history, so I thought that arts management at Post would work for me,” Evelin Figueroa-Ballester, freshman arts management major, said. “I’ve been looking at grad school requirements, and I’ve noticed that Post does not offer a lot of the courses that I need.”
There are few non-introductory arts history courses, according to Figueroa-Ballester, so she’s strongly considering transferring, especially since the arts management program is in danger.
Some students prefer ensuring a positive outlook for their program, rather than just a fun college experience.
“I love the classes and faculty here,” Figueroa-Ballester said. “But I need to go somewhere that will return on my investment in my education. I need a place that will further my career.”

The baseball team played a successful weekend as they completed a three-game series sweep over the St.Peter’s Peacocks from March 5-8. Pitching was the main highlight for the Sharks, with the offense close behind, as they outscored the Peacocks 26-3 throughout the three games.
​On Thursday, March 5, the Sharks won 6-0. Senior pitcher Jackson Svete threw seven scoreless innings, striking 12 batters out along the way and scattering four hits. He was backed up by the Sharks offense, who put up two runs in the first inning, capped by Cooper Shearon’s RBI double.
The score remained at 2-0 until the 8th inning, when the Sharks tacked on four runs of insurance, highlighted by Shearon, who hit a base-clearing triple to score three. Rob Griswold closed out the game with his second save of the year.
After struggling early in the year, Shearon could not have been more excited to play great baseball in front of the home crowd.
“Finally getting to open up at home was awesome. The team played great, and I was happy to be playing the caliber of baseball I know I can,” he said.
Shearon was named NEC player of the week for his production against St.Peters.
“ I couldn’t have done it without my teammates and coaches so it’s great to be able to experience it with them,” he said.
Head Coach Dan Pirillo had a positive take on the atmosphere of the first home game of the season.
“We had a good crowd and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The energy in our dugout was the best I’ve seen all year,” he said. This was their first Division I game held on campus.
In the game on Saturday, March 7, the story was a bit different. The Sharks blew the Peacocks out, 15-1. At the beginning of the game, the Sharks scored two early runs. In the fourth inning, the Sharks scored seven runs, sending 13 batters to the plate. Senior outfielder Tim Bechtold and junior infielder Chris Wasson each recorded an RBI, and Shearon tacked on two RBI as well.
On the mound, sophomore Josh Loeschorn pitched five innings, surrendering just one unearned run. His 0.00 ERA through two starts leads all pitchers in the NEC. Pirillo is proud of Loeschorn and his recent performances.
“Josh has worked hard to understand himself as a pitcher and to be the best pitcher possible, Josh is a competitor on the mound and it will be fun to continue watching him develop,” he said.
To finish out the game, senior Mike Lazos, redshirt sophomore Nick DeSalvo, and junior Josh Gainer each pitched scoreless innings.
Game three was slightly tighter on Sunday, March 8, but the Sharks were able to complete the sweep with a 5-2 victory. Freshman infielder Carlton Harper led the way for the Sharks, going 3-4 with two doubles and a single. Shearon tacked on a triple and an RBI double. Junior catcher and infielder Dawson Degnan and junior infielder Davyn Adamscheck each tallied two hits as well.

Taking the rubber, sophomore pitcher Alec Huertas threw five innings of one-run balls. Rob Griswold secured the save, throwing 1.1 innings, striking out four batters. The Sharks improved to 5-6 with the three-game sweep.
After struggling to string wins together early, Pirillo was pleased with the outcome of this series. “We lost a few close games early on in the season where we played well but fell short. It was great to see the guys put together a complete weekend on both sides of the ball,” he said.
Many players were able to break out of a slump in their series against St. Peters. “It was great to see Shearon, Harper along with some other guys have some positive results offensively. Early on, we were putting good at-bats together but the result wasn’t showing up in the box score,” Pirillo said.
