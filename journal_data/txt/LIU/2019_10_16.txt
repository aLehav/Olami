The name Mia McLeod will go down in women’s ice hockey program history. On Tuesday, Oct. 8, the Sharks received their first player recognition in the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance as Mia McLeod was named “Rookie of the Week.”
The Canadian received the award after a well-deserved weekend of play. In the Sharks’ inaugural opening night against University of Connecticut, McLeod faced 53 shots and made 49 saves. This left the freshman goalie with a save percent-age of 93 percent after her first night of play. 
Head Coach Rob Morgan had been watching Mia in net since his days coaching at Yale University. He had first seen her play at the age of 14, and once Morgan was named the head coach at LIU, “it was a no brainer,” about bringing McLeod to come play for him, he said. 
McLeod began playing hockey at the age of eight, but didn’t become a goalie until she was 10. The first time she tried the goalie position, McLeod was hooked.L “You do rotations as a goalie and everyone gets a chance and it was my turn and I just kind of stuck with it. I liked it and I felt kind of good at it,” McLeod said. 
As a five-sport athlete in high school, Mia McLeod is no stranger to a highly competitive environment. She competed in cross country, volleyball, hockey, track, and ultimate Frisbee. 
“Ultimate Frisbee was really fun, I had never played it before and then I started in grade ten and it was just something to do on the side, and it was really fun,” McLeod said.    
With hockey at the top of McLeod’s list of favorites, track and field came as a close second of the sports she’s participated in. McLeod also competed as a pole vaulter for three years in high school. 
“It was something different to do than hockey but just learning how and flying in the air in pole vaulting was really fun,” she said. 
The Sharks have left their footprint in Division I Ice Hockey as they became the first ever program on the island. However, for McLeod and her squad, it hasn’t been an easy task. The Sharks’ biggest challenge for both coaches and players is having such a young team. With 23 team members, 21 are freshmen. The other two players are transfer students that came in as a sophomore and a junior. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it’s their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win. We want to have that mindset that we are a team that can win our conference every year,” Coach Morgan said.
McLeod also feels the pressure of having a young team. However, she reminds herself that they are making history. She believes that she and her team can take their skills and strengths and win a conference championship. 
On Friday, Oct. 18, McLeod and her team will take on reigning National Women’s Ice Hockey Division I Champions against the University of Wisconsin Badgers at their home arena in Syosset, New York.

The Sharks Prepare for the Big Homecoming GameThe football team celebrates their first homecoming game as the Sharks on Saturday, Oct. 19. Despite a rough start to the season with five consecutive losses, anticipation is high and the team is prepared to win their first game at their homefield. “Everything is new with the same old tradition. There is a new name and colors, yet we are still conscience of our winning tradition and great success on homecoming and look to give the fans a victory,” head coach Bryan Collins said. 
This homecoming match is against the Saint Francis University Red Flash, who have a 3-3 season record and are 1-1 in the Northeast Conference. Despite the Sharks’ losing streak in their first season playing Division I, they are decreasing the score difference in every game. Collins is optimistic to the trend and said the plan is to let his young team find their way. “They are getting more comfortable and getting closer to winning, while getting a strong foundation while competing,” he said.       
To be successful in future games, Collins pointed out that the team needs all 11 on the field to work together and play well, along with all 22 total starters. “For the homecoming game against the Red Flash, the Sharks want to make sure they focus on their own performance. We need to worry about ourselves and making ourselves aware,” Collins said. “They were the 2015 conference champs and they are a big physical team and we will match their intensity in front of our own crowd.”   
The Sharks only have three home games this season, and Collins wants to take the chance to celebrate a win at their homefield. “You always want to defend your home turf,” he said. “It is more fun against your home crowd, and is a better experience for your fans and alumni. You want to take advantage and have a great home record, even more important for homecoming.”

When discussing the topic of bullying, we think of multiple scenarios: physical intimidation, targeted cyberbullying and social exclusion, to name a few. Bullying takes many forms, which is why it can be a difficult subject to talk about. One thing all of the scenarios have in common is that they involve clear delineations between the people who are perpetrating the offensive behavior, the “bullies,” and the ones who are being bullied, the “victims.” 
This is one of the main issues I have with how bullying is perceived today, and it is some-thing that should be changed. Some people are quick to put the labels of “bully” and “victim” on the participants in a scenario. Once we as-sign these labels, it’s easy to make assumptions about those involved. The bullies are generalized as big, tough and uncaring, and need to be “put in their place.” Conversely, the image of “victims” portray them as small, weak or help-less, and they need to be “saved.” These labels aren’t truly representative of who a person is as a human being. Human life and interactions are too complicated to be reduced to simplicity. 
Honestly, most of us have participated in behavior similar to bullying before; some of us have also been on the receiving end. But these experiences don’t totally define our character. For National Bullying Prevention month, we should start prevention by moving away from these labels. We need to take a more person-centered approach and remember that every one of us is a human being who is worthy of empathy, care and respect.
Of course, those who harm others should still be disciplined appropriately. But we should keep in mind that someone engaging in bully-ing behavior may also have experience with be-ing a victim of some kind. Understanding and empathy for each person can lead to a more peaceful world. 
This issue is close to me and is something that I intend to spend my entire life working towards improving for the good of the world. To this effect, I founded the Be the Change club at Post, and I am working on launching a larger version of this organization on a more commu-nity-based level. Both organizations have the goal of bringing people together, eliminating labels and stereotypes and fostering empathy and compassion for all. I do not explicitly label these projects as “anti-bullying” efforts because it is time to get away from using that language, which perpetuates the issue of labels. 
Always remember that you have the power to make positive change in the lives of those around you. You can make a difference that turns someone’s whole world around simply by recognizing and acknowledging them as a fellow human being. If we all keep practicing this, then I truly believe that together we can make bullying a thing of the past.

From popping adderall to closeted gay romances to sexist dress codes, its everybody’s least favorite time in their lives: middle school. “Big Mouth” is back and bigger than ever tackling more issues that riddle modern day puberty with its crude comedic touch to their overall positive messages. 
In previous seasons, “Big Mouth” discussed menstruation, the female and male body, awkward first kisses, upsetting first breakups, cringey middle school romance, and the dynamics of young friendships. With a full fledged eleven-episode third season, the show opens the discussion even further to some more pressing matters. 
Imoniri Aghomon is a sophomore healthcare administration major. “I liked season 3 a lot. It brought about more of the dynamics I was thinking about for kids that age like LGBTQ, male self control, [and] females being blamed for making guys feel aroused,” Aghomon said. “It brought about lots of issues that also happen in middle school and how teachers react and shy away from gender discrimination.” 
If you love character arcs, then you’ll be happy to know that new insight was shed upon many different characters. Matthew (Andrew Rannels) embarks upon finding gay love, Jay Bilzerian (Jason Mantzoukas) explores his sexuality and mental health, Nick (Kroll) struggles with phone addiction and a new romance, Missy Foreman-Greenwald (Jenny Slate) deals with controlling her alter ego and also a new romance, Andrew Globerman (John Mulaney) dips his toes in the waters of forbidden love, and much more. There’s also the introduction of some new characters, including Ali (Ali Wong), a pansexual transfer student, and a female hormone monster.
Continuing the tradition of the previous seasons, this season promises a number of musical breaks, including a song about anti-slut shaming, and even an entire episode for the school’s deeply innopropriate choice of a musical based off of the 1994 erotic thriller Disclosure. 
These numbers bring another dimension of comedy and playfulness to the show as each song carries its purpose through well and gracefully. The transitions from dialogue to singing and dancing are arguably smoother than previous seasons, and are aren’t as random as previously shown.
All in all, season three of “Big Mouth” did not disappoint with its comedic material or its creativity on discussing these taboo topics. “It was a bit fuzzy during the first episode, but it really delivered, and I’d be okay if the show ended on that season,” Aghomon said.
Yes, the show is beyond crude by showing naked cartoons of middle schoolers and showing Jay have sexual relationships with various inanimate objects, but it takes the shame away from going through puberty. All the things we were embarrassed about and found hard to discuss at that age is being discussed in a lighthearted sense with positive reinforcement. 
There are completely exaggerated situations, but they get the point across. If you’re looking for a good relatable laugh with intriguing story lines and engaging characters, then “Big Mouth” season three is right up your alley.

“I think it would be a really nice opportunity to be recognized for a lot of the different roles that I’ve had throughout my three plus years here. I’ve been a resident assistant, an orientation leader, I’ve held a number of positions in my sorority, Delta Zeta, and I’ve held a number of jobs on campus.” “[Homecoming] is a cute little thing that is a tradition every year, and LIU is really big on tradition, so I figured why not be a part of it?” 

Gabrielle Barone
 “Since I’ve been a student here, I have become more involved and a bigger part of the community and I am always looking to be the voice of the people and what better way to do that than becoming homecoming queen!” “As LIU Ambassador I am always looking for ways to add annual events, organizations and service opportunities to better the community within the university. If I became homecoming queen I would also hold open forums and meetings to hear the voices of all the students so we can not just talk about but implement change.” 

Ashley Rodriguez
 “Throughout my entire four years here at Post I have always tried to step out of my comfort zone. I wanted to do something that I normally would never even think of. For me, running for Homecoming Queen is about representing the student body and being a part of campus life. I want to become more involved and branch out socially.” “I hope to be able to lay the foundation of a more open flow of communication between the student body and administration.” 

Adam Silverstein
 “I feel that this is a great opportunity, and I think it is very special that I am running for homecoming king during the first year ever that the campuses are united. Ever since I came to this school as a freshman, I’ve always done my best to bring positive change to LIU, and to help the whole school to be the most positive, supportive, caring, safe, and fun atmosphere for everyone who goes here.”

Halloween is right around the corner and students are getting ready for the night of fright. The Rainbow Alliance, along with the Forensic Science Club and the Promethean Pitch Acapella, will host a haunted house to get students into a frightening mood.
The event is on Thursday, Oct. 24, at 7 p.m. inside the Interfaith Center chapel. Admission is $8 for students, $5 for kids, and $10 for adults.
The idea for the event originally came from the Forensic Science Club, who hosted a similar event last year. This year they wanted to make the event even bigger, so they asked the Rainbow Alliance and the Promethean Pitch Acapella to pitch in.
Participants of the haunted house will be taken on a tour of the chapel with a thrilling twist. As you progress from room to room, beware of ghosts and other monsters who could jump out at every turn. During the tour, the guide will share a scary story written by the Promethean Pitch Acapella and the Forensic Science Club to bring the whole experience together.
Nicole Ludwig, a junior philosophy major and president of the Rainbow Alliance, is very excited to have a chance to tell an interactive story. “Putting all this together is very much like directing a play,” she said. “For me, as a writer [being able] to tell a story and walk someone through it is just the greatest feeling.”

The campus radio station, The Wave, formerly WCWP, is hosting its annual Alumni Takeover during Homecoming weekend from Wednesday, Oct. 16 to Sunday, Oct. 20. The event will also mark the 58th anniversary of the radio station being on campus. During the event, former students of the station return to take over the airwaves and programming for the entire weekend.
The first broadcast of the event will feature Art Beltrone, an alumnus who was present the day the radio station opened in 1961. Other broadcasts will include alumni who graduated in the 60’s, all the way up to the class of 2018. 
Students can expect a variety of programming over the course of the weekend. “Some [alumni] like to do talk shows, some like to do different kinds of music,” Jeff Kroll, a graduate from the class of 1975 and head of the WCWP Alumni Association, explained. “We have jazz shows, heavy metal shows, rap shows, disco shows, and anything in between.”
Alumni will be returning from all around the country for the big event. “We’re going to have people here from far away as Florida, the Carolina’s, Virginia, the Tri-State [area], and of course people who are nearby here on Long Island,” Kroll said.
Beyond being able to take over the radio waves again, a joyous part of the event is being able to explore campus and reminisce about their time here. “There’s nothing like coming back during a fall weekend and just taking it all in again,” Kroll said. “It always brings back a flood of memories from your time here, whenever that time was.”
Kroll invites any students who are interested in broadcasting to come to the radio station and discuss what it takes to succeed in the industry. “A number of people who will be here that week-end have pursued careers in broadcasting, both radio and television. If you would like to touch base, pick their brains as to what it takes to get into the business, by all means stop by and do so,” he said

The campus community is comprised of various groups and individuals, and as more students develop a sense of identity during their college career, other members of the community are making an effort to accommodate them. Members of the Promise Office are hosting safe zone training sessions to educate students about LGBTQ identities, gender and sexuality. The training will also examine prejudice, assumptions and privilege. 
Julia Pagano, associate director of Promise, is a training facilitator. “Safe zone training consists of a presentation, videos, individual and group activities, and round table discussions,” Pagano said.    
“It talks about how to make a safe space in any kind of environment you may be,” Christina Lynch, senior speech language pathology major and Riggs Hall resident assistant, said. “In the RA role, it’s really important because college is a really important time for people to express who they are and find out what it means to be themselves.”   
Campus Life staff began safe zone training on campus in 2015. “As college campuses became more diverse, it was important to us to educate the student body on LGBTQ identities, gender and sexuality,” Pagano said.
The entire Promise staff, most Greek organizations, and all resident assistants are safe zone certified, according to Pagano. “It’s our job to be there for our residents, and any student in general, to make sure they feel safe and welcomed,” Lynch said.
Resident assistants get recertified every year. “My first time around I learned a lot about definitions and [the] basics,” Lynch said. These include things like what it means to be transgender, gay or part of the LGBTQ community. “Every year after that it’s been learning from other people and [their] experience and relating to the different people who have been in the training with me.” 
As a training facilitator, Pagano leads discussions and presents up-to-date information. “I have been the facilitator for about two years, and I have heard only positive feedback from the students. The training is engaging, fun, and educational,” she said. “I have always been an advocate and ally for the community. When I was given the opportunity to become the facilitator, I was happy to say yes.”Anyone who completes the training receives Safe Zone Certification. “When someone is safe zone certified they receive a certificate, or sticker, showing that they completed the training,” Pagano said. “Individuals who are certified pledge to be better allies, provide safe spaces, and support for the community.” 
Upcoming training sessions will be held in Humanities on Thursday, Oct. 17 at 4 p.m. and in the Pratt Recreation Center on Oct. 21 at 4 p.m. Sessions last up to two hours, and anyone is welcome to attend.
Lynch recommends that any student attend the training.“It never hurts to educate yourself. You may think you know something, but it never hurts to get another level of information,” Lynch said. Those who are interested in participating can sign up at tinyurl.com/safezone-forsharks.

Many residents living in Kings Hall are becoming aware of the presence of mold in their dorm rooms and residence hall. Students are concerned for their health and believe the mold is causing an endless cycle of sickness in their building.
An emergency evacuation occurred in suite room 104 on the first floor of Kings Hall on Tuesday, Oct. 1. A strong stench emerged overnight, according to Russel Drowne, a freshman game design major who lives in the suite with his two roommates. “[The smell] was just rotten. That’s the best way I could describe it; and you couldn’t really tell where it was from because it was just everywhere,” he said.
After cleaning out the entire room and not finding the source of the smell, the three suitmates brought the issue to an RA’s attention. Two days into the investigation, the three freshmen were informed via email that their room was “deemed unlivable” and were advised to find a new living situation for the time being, according to Drowne. He reached out to the Promise Office regarding new dorm and they gave him some options to choose from. 
It’s still unclear what the origin of the smell is, but Drowne and his previous suitemates suspect it’s either the result of mold or a dead animal in the pipes underneath the flooring in the middle of the room. “I think other people are getting [mold] in their rooms too because I know my room is not the first that’s having issues,” Drowne said. 
Although, Drowne was unable to provide information on other residents experiencing mold problems, he said he’s certain there’s mold in the laundry room. Kelly Crowley, a freshman psychology major and resident of Kings Hall, noticed it too. “It’s all over the laundry room and it’s even starting to smell,” she said. 
RA’s living in Kings said they were not allowed to provide The Pioneer with any information regarding mold in the building. Roy Fergus, head of facilities services, was unable to be reached for comment. 
Complaints about mold in residence halls is nothing new, and many students are concerned it’s causing their constant sickness. Rabecca Baze, a freshman biology major who also lives in Kings Hall, believes the mold is harming her and her roommate’s health. “There is mold downstairs all over the laundry room; on the ceiling [tiles]; and it’s spreading through the vents,” she said. “My roommate and I think we are getting sick from it.” Baze was unable to provide evidence of the mold spreading into the vents.
Baze claimed she and her roommate have been sick for weeks, and she’s convinced the mold is the cause. She believes the mold has affected other Kings residents as well. “If you walk down the hall, you can hear different people sniffling or coughing, and it’s kinda gross,” Baze said. 
Apparent renovations have taken place around campus, including paint jobs, signage and updated athletic fields. Baze has noticed such changes and believes the school’s choice to neglect the resident halls is unfair. “I hate to say it, but [the school] puts more effort into changing the outside looks of it, over what’s actually inside,” Baze said.  
A freshman fashion merchandising major, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed with Baze, and said, “It’s upsetting to see that the school doesn’t care about our health as much as it cares about painting Humanities [Hall].”
Baze met with the head of residence life, Maegen Wallaker, on Monday, Oct. 14, about the issue. Wallaker explained that she knew of the mold, but was shocked to hear that it wasn’t fixed. According to Baze, Wallaker informed Baze that a request was sent out approximately two to three weeks ago to address the situation. Wallaker provided Baze and her roommate the option to move out of Kings Hall into Nassau Hall because of the issue.
It is still unclear when or if the mold issue will be fixed for the remaining residents in Kings Hall.

 National Coming Out Day was observed this past Friday, Oct. 11. The day is an annual event dedicated to raising awareness for the LGBTQ+ community. “Coming out” is a term that refers to when people accept their sexual orientation or gender identity, and are ready to share who they are with other people.
The first National Coming Out Day was observed on Oct. 11, 1988, to mark the anniversary of “The Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights,” one of largest demonstartions for LGBTQ+ rights to ever take place in the United States. 
Ever since people have used the day as an opportunity to share messages of encouragement to people who have not come out yet, celebrate those that have, and show their support for the LGBTQ+ community. 
Promise joined in the festivities by taking part in the #WearTheRibbon campaign. According to LGBT Network, the organizers of the event, the purpose of the campaign is to create a visual representation of support. “People participate in the campaign by wearing a rainbow ribbon, a symbol of LGBT pride and history, as a way to visually ‘come out’ in support of safe spaces for LGBT people.” 
“This is the third year LIU Promise has participated in the #WearTheRibbon Campaign which works to create safe spaces for all members of the LGBTQIA* community,” said Matthew Blanar, Director of Events & Operations. “Members of the LIU community were able to stop by the Promise office to sign the pledge and pick up their rainbow ribbon, a symbol of pride and history as well as a symbol of support for a safer spaces for all members of this community.”
Nicole Ludwig, a junior philosophy major and president of the Rainbow Alliance, talked about the importance of the day. “When we have this day for it I feel like it’s more empowering and it pushes people towards the right direction,” she said.  
“Even if you’re not ready to come out, I feel like people still feel strong and supported by seeing all the LGBT positive things put around [and] seeing people wear things that say they support the community,” she continued. “Even if they’re not ready to come out, they’re not safe to come out, they’re reminded that there are still quite a lot of people supporting them.
”It’s also important to remember that “coming out” can happen to the same person multiple times. “Coming out is never a one step thing,” Ludwig said. “Maybe you tell all your friends but your family doesn’t know, or vice versa. Then you meet other people and you are constantly coming out.”

 Some resident students have growing concerns about privacy and monetary fines after resident assistants informed them of surveillance cameras monitoring their use of restricted side entrances and exits. 
RAs notified residents during a mandatory meeting at the start of the fall semester that use of the side doors is restricted during certain hours of the day. Consequences related to their misuse was also discussed, which includes a write up or a costly fine, according to RAs. “No residents should enter the side doors ever,” Louis Copertino, a Riggs Hall RA and senior public relations major, said.
But, returning campus residents already know what it’s like to approach a side door and hear an RA give warning that the side doors are off limits; however, some students residing in Brookville Hall were surprised to learn that surveillance cameras monitoring the side doors may have facial recognition. 
Riggs Hall resident and junior criminal justice major, Abby Timmins, said an advanced surveillance system is a good idea if the residence halls experienced a high volume of break-ins, but that isn’t the case. “They’re now just there to deter people from using the side door, which they’re going to do anyways,” she said. “A smarter idea would’ve been to move the front [entrance] of Brookville to the side where all the cars are parked,” Timmins suggested. “That way, it’s more convenient and safer for students.”
Considering the dorms are where students shower, many residents havebecome suspect about camera locations inside the building. “I think that they’re important. I don’t want to look at it as an invasion of privacy rather than keeping the building safer. Looking at it as an invasion of privacy is definitely interesting. That’s something that I’ve never thought of. I do see how it can be perceived that way,” Copertino said. 
Other residents are somewhat understanding of the matter. Cara Kennedy, a senior speech pathology major who lived in Queens, Brookville and Post Halls prior to moving off campus, said she doesn’t see it as an invasion of privacy. 
“If I’m gonna walk outside in the hall in my towel to go shower, then that’s my choice. There’s a possibility someone will see me. So, if a camera sees me too, that’s expected,” she said. 
As far as facial recognition capability, Copertino said that he’s never heard about it. “There are cameras in Brookville and they can see people’s faces and they’re just there for the protection of students and safety of the building,” he said. 
Brookville Hall, which is known to house upperclassmen and athletes, grew itself a wild reputation over the years, according to junior criminal justice major, Ben Perez, who is one of the RA’s in the building. He said from what he’s been told, Brookville cameras have facial recognition capability. 
Many attribute the hall’s supposed, advanced surveillance to its rowdiness, but Perez disagrees. “Being a part of this community, and being here everyday, it’s really not bad and the people are great,” he said. 
Although, many residents state they weren’t aware of the advanced technology, Perez said, “there’s notes in front of the side door, clearly presented, that show ‘don’t go out the side door. There’s facial recognition cameras.’” 
One Brookville resident recalls her RA mentioning that the cameras can recognize a student’s face when exiting the building. “I was shocked. Honestly, didn’t think the school would take it that far; doesn’t really freak me out too much, though. It might be helpful. If something bad happens to one student by another student, they have a picture of it,” said Alexandra Holdridge, a sophomore accounting major. 
Despite the written warning on the doors, public safety denies the technology exists. “None of the cameras on campus have facial recognition,” said Michael Fevola, university director of public safety. He also confirmed that cameras are located on the first floor of each dorm, the laundry rooms and on the outside of the buildings. “The public safety base is the only location on campus with access to view the cameras in real time. RAs do not have any access to view cameras at all,” he said.  
RAs who catch students using the side doors must report the incident to the resident director who then contacts public safety and later issues the fines, according to Kaitlyn Klein, a senior who is double majoring in forensic science and criminal justice. She was an RA in Post Hall and the South Residence Complex before she moved off campus. 
Students like Holdridge and Kennedy have heard conflicting information regarding how much it will cost a student if they’re caught breaking the side door rules. “The RA said $25 but I’ve heard $50 from other people,” Holdridge said. Perez claims violators will receive a $25 fine regardless of what hall they live in, and Copertino said the fine is $50. Sophomore international business major Calah Turpin, who is currently an RA in Post Hall, said the fines range anywhere from $50 to $100, and she believes the amount is based on how many times a student was caught. 
Kennedy said she doesn’t believe the cameras were ever on while she was living on campus. 
“Every time someone entered through the side door, they didn’t know who did it because they didn’t have them on. No one has ever been fined,” she said. But Klein, the former Post Hall & SRC RA, confirmed they always worked. “That’s how we got documentations on the side doors,” she said. “[The fine] was $25. I believe it was $50 for code sharing of your dorm room which is where I think people have been getting $50 from.
”All discipline related to dorm violations is mediated by the Executive Dean of Students, Michael Berthel, according to Fevola. Rules regarding unauthorized exit/entry of a building, as per the university Code of Conduct, can be found on line at liu.edu/Post/Campus-Life, according to Jean Ann Smith, Associate Dean of Students. “All of our community members are encouraged to play an active role in the safety of our student body, residential and commuters alike,” she said. The Code of Conduct, however, fails to clarify the amount of the fine.
Berthel backed up Fevola’s response about existing cameras: “Cameras are used through-out campus to ensure the safety of all students, faculty, staff and visitors. These cameras do not have facial recognition software. Public Safety is always evaluating the need for additional cameras throughout campus, including residence halls.” Berthel said.
