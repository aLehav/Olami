Sammy Bell, junior psychology major, is a forward on the field hockey team, as well as the team’s leading scorer. During her time playing as a Shark for the fall 2019 season, Bell scored nine goals and 20 points throughout the 14 games the team played. 
Bell hails from Scotland and started playing field hockey there when she was seven years old. After playing field hockey in high school, Bell decided to attend college in America and chose LIU after Head Coach Raenee Savin got in contact with her. “Coach Savin reached out to me and I had never been to America before so I was very excited,” she said.
Bell played the previous two seasons with the Post Pioneers. As a freshman in 2017, she co-lead the team in assists, and along with 11 goals, she finished third on the team’s scoring list with 35 points. In 2018, Bell was second in all three categories with 16 goals, seven assists, and 39 points. 
Bell had a slow start to this season, but between Sunday, Oct. 13 and Friday, Oct. 25, she scored six goals in four games, including an overtime goal against Sacred Heart University, her second that day. Bell said the reason for her recent success is due to her team. “They have been hyping me up and playing better to win and want me to do well,” she said. Bell has also taken 62 out of the team’s 155 shots this season. She thanks senior midfielder and team captain Taylor Brodsky for that statistics. “Taylor is the reason I have many shots, as she is able to set me up for good scoring opportunities,” she said.  
Brodsky predicts Bell will have a big impact in the upcoming games. “She’s a big part of our team and we rely on her a lot,” she said. Bell is a great player with a humble attitude, but she needs pushing from her captain, according to Brodsky. “She needs to be pushed a lot but she is a very humble player and it’s been an honor to play with such a good field hockey player, and especially to be the person that pushes her every day,” she said.     
Junior goalkeeper Rachel Vellis is one of Bell’s close friends and said that she loves to see her score. “She is my best friend and gets me really hyped up. It gets me excited when I hear the echo from the other side of the field,” Vellis said. She also said that Bell is a strong presence on the field and brings a lot of energy.  
Coach Savin has coached Bell for three years and said she has seen her develop from a freshman who wasn’t prepared for the amount of conditioning collegiate field hockey requires, to one of the team’s most valuable players. “The summer after her freshman year, she made a huge adjustment, which helped prepare her for the great season that she had last year,” Savin said. “Sammy has been a huge asset for our team and we need her to keep putting the ball in the back of the net because very often we come out on top when she’s scoring.”  
Going forward, Bell and the field hockey team play their last games of the regular season on Friday, Nov. 1, against Fairfield University and on Sunday, Nov. 3, against Temple University. The Sharks will then prepare for the NEC Tournament since the team secured a spot in the playoffs with a 1-0 win over Bryant University on Sunday Oct. 27. They are the first Shark team of the new Division I program to claim a playoff berth. The NEC championship tournament is being hosted in Staten Island at Wagner University on Friday, Nov. 8 and Sunday, Nov. 10.

The men’s soccer team took down Bryant University in a 2-0 shutout on Monday, Oct. 28. The game quickly turned into a two-day event after heavy rain and lightning forced Sunday’s afternoon’s game to be finished on Monday afternoon. 
The game was set to start on Sunday, Oct. 27, at 1 p.m. and that it did. However, only 10 minutes into the game, inclement weather and field conditions forced the game to a stop, and it was decided that the game would resume on Monday at 1 p.m. 
“I’m just glad it was only ten minutes into the game and not 50, 60 minutes into the game because that would have really affected both teams physically,” Sharks’ Head Coach Michael Mordocco said. 
The entire first half was dominated by mid-field play and very little scoring opportunities for either team. Going into halftime, each team was scoreless.
It was a second half spark by freshman Papa Ndoye that sent the Bryant Bulldogs back to Rhode Island with a loss. Ndoye sent his first goal past the Bryant goalkeeper in the 49th minute of play, assisted by junior Jonas Dovland. Only 15 minutes later, Ndoye sent his second shot of the day to the back of the net off a long ball pass from senior Kyle Parish.
The Sharks defense played a key role in helping goalkeeper, Demetri Skoumbakis earn his second shutout in the past three games. Skoumbakis only needed to come up with two saves in the win. Even with eight corner kick opportunities in the second half, the Bulldogs were held to zero shots on goal by the stellar Shark defense. 
“Our back four has been incredible. It’s really important that they get a lot of credit because when you don’t give up goals you have a better chance of winning the game,” Mordocco said.
With only three more games in the regular season, the Sharks have placed themselves in a good position to end up among the top four teams in the conference who will get to play for the NEC Championship trophy. Before the game against the Bryant Bulldogs, the Sharks was ranked as the No. 4 team in the NEC and Bryant University was ranked as No. 2. 
After Monday’s game, the teams traded spots and the Sharks are now in second place. “We’re not there yet. But any points you get from here on out is really important. We have to win our home games in order to make the playoffs,” Mordocco said.
With two goals in Monday’s game, Mordocco highlights Ndoye’s importance, but also adds that the entire team is the reason for their success, not just one player. He’s [Ndoye] really important. If he can get goals, we’ll win games. But the contributions from other guys has been incredible,” Mordocco said. 
“Our center backs, Stefan [Faistenauer] and Kyle [Parish], you know, scoring goals, getting points, guys in the midfield who weren’t getting goals or assists all year who are starting to contribute on the offensive end. It’s not just Papa, it’s the whole team contributing.” 
The team’s main goal moving forward is to take one game at a time. It is going to be a team effort in order to see the playoffs according to Mordocco, but he believes his team got what it takes. 
Next up, the team heads to western Pennsylvania to take on Robert Morris University on Friday, Nov. 1, at 3 p.m.

It’s the most wonderful time of the year when Mercury, the planet of logic and communication, moves its orbit into retrograde (Rx). Mercury Rx begins on Thursday, Oct. 31 and lasts until Wednesday, Nov. 20. For those of you wondering why a planet’s change in orbit is significant, sit tight, because this one is a rollercoaster ride. 
Mercury in astrology rules over your day-to-day expressions and relationships; it’s how you understand the world and relate to those around you, either through your thoughts, communication style, your wit and sense of humor. When in retrograde, Mercury’s orbit appears to go backwards. This period of retrograde is a time of reflection, when past issues or suppressed emotions resurface and force you to take a deeper look at your life. While the idea of confronting issues and people you’d rather avoid can make you want to run, it’s important to your growth as a person to face them.
Some of the things to look out for this Mercury Rx, which happens to fall during Scorpio season, are issues in relationships. Miscommunication, secrets and betrayal are common themes of Mercury Rx, as are issues with technology, and those themes paired with the intense nature of Scorpio season can make it feel like the world around you is ending. Don’t worry, it’s not. 
There are ways to navigate Mercury Rx and to minimize the collateral damage. Think of this period as a time to reevaluate your life, weed out what’s unnecessary and holding you back, and start anew. 
Some overall tips to keep in mind to avoid retrograde blowing up in your face:
Take your time making decisions. You are more prone to impulsive behavior during retrograde, which can lead to fires that can be hard to put out. Before you do something, weigh the pros and cons.
Communicate clearly and thoughtfully. Be mindful of how your words and thoughts are perceived. Before any serious conversation, make sure you are prepared to speak effectively.
Don’t be careless. You are more likely to make silly mistakes during retrograde that could hurt you down the road. Make sure to double and triple check everything you do.
Back up your phones, computers and other electronics daily. Technology tends to crash more often during retrograde, so to avoid losing important things, make sure you have a back up plan. 
Keep notes on important things. This retrograde will test your memory, and you are more likely to forget things during this time. Write things down in your planner, phone notes, or on your hand. You’ll thank me later. 
It’s important to have a positive mindset to guide you through this retrograde. Negative thoughts and energies being put into your life will only reward you with more of the same. Try not to succumb to your deepest insecurities by actively looking for positive outcomes. Reflect, revise and renew, and you will get through Mercury Rx alive. 
Editor’s Note: The advice offered in this article are only suggestions based off of traditional astrology occurrences. To learn more about astrology and how certain planets and signs relate to you, start by finding out your natal chart at astro.cafeastrology.com/natal.php

The Student Activities Board (SAB) hosted comedian hypnotist Keith Karkut in the Gold Coast Cinema on Tuesday, Oct. 22. From 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., the 43 audience members were entertained as Karkut hypnotized a group of  students live. 
Karkut is a well-practiced hypnotist with over 25 years of experience under his belt. He stressed to his audience members that hypnotism does not work with everyone. “If you’re going to come up here tonight and you have the slightest bit of hesitation [or] if you’re going to try and fake it, please do not bother… because it’s not going to work,” he said. According to Karkut, hypnosis only works on individuals who are “happy, healthy and really want to make it work.”
A total of 14 students volunteered to be hypnotized. While in a hypnotized state, Karkut was able to convince these individuals to perform funny acts for the audience. 
In one instance, Karkut convinced a particular student that he was Tarzan and in desperate need of finding his partner, Jane. With the snap of Karkut’s fingers, this student jumped off the stage,  paced around the cinema, pounded his chest multiple times, and screamed for Jane over and over as audience members erupted in laughter. 
Later in the show, Karkut convinced all 14 students that they were in a dance competition and the winner was going to receive a cash prize. The hypnotized students performed the many different styles of dance Karkut told them to enact, including salsa, the robot and more.
In the freestyle edition of the competition, freshman musical theatre major, Gabriella Beckman gained the attention of the audience when she did the splits. At the end of the show, she was shocked when she realized what she had done. “I didn’t realize I did a split, and ballet,” she said with a laugh.
At the end of the show, Karkut said with confidence, “I truly believe each and every one of you were hypnotized in some way or form.”

Hello students, in today’s commuter column I will discuss the dangers of the roads. Every-thing from patrolling police, road closings and weather warnings are all possible delays when making your way to campus in the morning. 
The number one delay that I am faced with a few times a week is car accidents on the Long Island Expressway. These accidents cause delays and shutdowns when traveling to school, forcing me to navigate through back roads I am unfamiliar with. Leaving yourself an extra 30 minutes in the morning to get to school is key when commuting. I like to call this buffer time. 
When facing inclement weather, it is very important to leave yourself more than 40 minutes of buffer time to commute. The weather slows down every person on the road. I have found myself going just above 20 mph on a main road while driving in the rain because of the danger of hydroplaning. 
Take your time to get to school by being cautious on the road, your professors can be very understanding when it comes to bad weather on the highways. 
Another concern to address are other drivers on the road. Sometimes during an accident, drivers will slow down to see what happened instead of focusing on their commute. This term is defined as rubbernecking.
Rubbernecking has caused me up to 20 minutes in delays multiple times throughout my college career. Despite the missed time, I can safely say that commuting has given me more patience when traveling to school. 
A serious concern is speeding, and this is for students who wake up late and try to rush to campus.  My message to you is SLOW DOWN! Police in Suffolk and Nassau Counties are strict, and become even more relentless when you enter the Village of Brookville. I have seen cops parked in the woods, under bridges and even on top of bridges looking for speeders. 
Getting ticketed on Long Island can result in a fine up to $200 and can leave up to two points on your driver’s license. Speeding is not worth the risk. Not only are you putting yourself in danger, you endanger others on the road as well.

Ava Paul, a sophomore musical theater major, recently starred in an Off-Broadway play “The Only Coffee Shop in the City.” The show focuses on a young college writer leaving New York City for London after a breakup. 
Paul played the character Rowan, a young entrepreneur who helps the main character in her time of need. 
Paul became interested in performing from a young age when she decided she wanted to be a singer. Paul’s parents chose to nurture her interests by enrolling her into a musical theater camp where her love for theater flourished. 
Paul originally auditioned for the part by sending in a self tape of her acting. When Paul went to meet the shows producers in person, she knew the part was perfect for her. “I knew as soon as I went and got to know the people who would be directing and producing it,” she said. “There was an energy in the room that these people want to make good art.”
All rehearsals of the play took place in different rehearsal rooms around New York City, meaning opening night was the first time the cast got to see the theater they were performing in. Paul did not let an unfamiliar atmosphere get in the way of her acting, however. “You just kind of lock into the character and then the rest just falls away,” she said, describing her feelings about the opening night performance.
Paul wants to pursue an acting career on Broadway, while also making time for other artistic endeavors. “Broadway is the dream, but I don’t want to just do Broadway,” she said. “I love performance arts, I love writing music, I love anything in the arts.”

With the end of October approaching and midterms becoming a painful memory of the past, students are looking to unwind and have a little fun. Luckily, Halloween is right around the corner. The annual celebration is a great way to let off some steam and have a good time. For students who don’t yet have any plans, here’s a list of some Halloween activities going on nearby. 
One terrifying attraction students may want to check out is Bayville Scream Park. This Halloween theme park advertises itself as the “largest Halloween attraction in the tri-state area.” It features six frightening haunted houses ranging from an abandoned fun house filled with clowns and an old temple haunted by an evil mummy. The park also features other Halloween activities like a spooky tree top climbing course and zombie pirate mini golf.

Another haunted house is Darkness Rising. Located in Copiague, this haunted house takes you on a terrifying journey through a cursed village, with evil lurking around every corner. A portion of the proceeds from the event are donated to the Yes Community Counseling Center, a non-profit organization that helps people struggling with domestic violence, substance abuse and other issues.
On a lighter note, for students who want to get in the spooky spirit without the chills and thrills of haunted houses, Rise of the Jack O’Lanterns might be just the thing. This garden trail, located at Old Westbury Gardens, features more than 5,000 jack o’lanterns all carved by professional artists. The event also features live carving sessions, allowing onlookers to see how professionals carve pumpkins and ask questions. 

 It’s no secret that people love to party on Halloween. Luckily, students won’t even need to leave campus for a fun night with their peers. Phi Sigma Kappa is hosting a Halloween masquerade party in the Tilles Center Atrium at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 31. Tickets are $20 at the door and include a mask, raffle tickets and concessions.
Whether you choose to spend your Halloween being scared senseless, partying the night away, or just hanging out with friends, the night is sure to be a fun time for all.

SMART boards have been an undeniable advantage to most professors, enabling them to engage in new and more meaningful ways of teaching than whiteboards and chalkboards ever did. The acronym stands for “Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology,” but at times, these interactive technologies are more trouble than they’re worth.
As campuses enter the age of information, it’s important for professors to become familiar with the technology involved in a “smart classroom.” SMART Learning software allows teachers to transform their content into an interactive experience, including lesson delivery, collaborative workspaces and learning activities. It’s beneficial to the classroom experience – until it becomes a timely headache, taking time away from a planned lesson.
“I’ve been having issues with the touch functionality,” said Anke Grosskopf, associate professor of political science and international studies. “So whenever I call IT, they’re really good about fixing it again, but then it works for one class. When I get to the classroom again, it’s not working.”
SMART boards consist of three parts: the projector, the board, and a small camera mounted above the board. One of Grosskopf’s students told her the problem may be caused by another faculty member who was bothered by the board’s “trembling” parts each time he got too close to it, causing him to disconnect and disable the mechanism.“
In previous semesters, I’ve had issues where the plug from the projector to the camera was taken out every time I was in the room. So, what I suspect is happening is something kind of similar to that,” Grosskopf said. “It’s a question of who’s resetting it, and why and how.”
This may just be a case in which the technology doesn’t function in ways that people want or expect it to, according to Grosskopf. In many situations, professors take private action instead of contacting the IT department to see if the problem can be addressed in a more systematic manner.
“As with any technology, there are going to be problems from time to time,” Manju Prasad-Rao, head of the Instructional Media Center, said. If restarting the SMART board or SMART Notebook program doesn’t fix the problem, she recommends using the technology without its touch capabilities to avoid losing time. She also suggests visiting the SMART Exchange for lessons to use in the meantime. 
In the past, Grosskopf asked the university for a computer with touch capability. She revamped all of her classes with slides that had a lot less pictures and visuals to make room for additional notes. When the school introduced the SMART board into the classrooms, she was already prepared to use it.
“It makes it more interactive for the students, and we can have different examples of questions or collect examples, or I [can] add additional information on the slides of what we’re doing,” Grosskopf said. She prefers the smart board over the dry erase board and chalkboard for many reasons. “One of the advantages it has for me: I’ll remember exactly where I was because that’s where my notes are.”
Some professors on campus don’t have SMART boards in their designated classrooms, while others choose to avoid it altogether. “Generally, l do not use SMART board technology because when it comes to technology, I’m not very smart,” said Michael Soupios, professor of political science.
Grosskopf said a lot of professors just use it to project the slideshow, so she understands why many don’t experience the same problems. Barbara Fowles, professor of communications and film, is one of the professors without access to a smart board.
“I do not have smart boards in my classrooms. I do have video hook-ups which I use all the time. This semester they have been working ok, generally. There are always issues with the audio, mostly horrible buzzing,” she said. 
Fowles thinks professors avoid using them because it’s too hard to learn and at times they might not work. “You have to not be afraid to look like a doofus if the technology doesn’t work while a class is waiting for you. And you always have to have a good Plan B, so if the technology doesn’t work it’s not a big deal,” she said.
Part of the problem, according to Grosskopf, is that faculty doesn’t receive a lot of training in professional development, especially on how to use the projectors and what they’re capable of. They’re mostly left to figure it out on their own. 
“I mean IT has been really great in resolving the issues that I’ve had very quickly,” she said. “Sometimes I’ve needed to go to the technology resource center and work with somebody there to help me work with IT to get things figured out when things just weren’t working.”
Until professional training is offered, professors will more than likely continue to avoid the smart boards all together. Prasad-Rao suggested professors ask their students to download the software application SMART Note-book, which enables students to make their own slides and lesson plans when a SMART board isn’t functional.

The LIU Theodore Roosevelt Institute held their first academic conference from Sunday, Oct. 27 to Wednesday, Oct. 30, honoring the life and achievements of President Theodore Roosevelt on the 100th anniversary of his passing. Over the course of four days, over a dozen sessions were hosted by 20 speakers with nearly 1,000 attendees on campus. 
Featured speakers of the conference included Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to President George W. Bush, Columbian Ambassador Francisco Santos, Historian Jorge Orlando Melo, Michelle Krowl, Susan Sarna, Todd Brewster, Geoffrey Cowan and Dr. Michael Cullinane. Speakers discussed Roosevelt in his contributions and work to diplomacy and foreign policy, Roosevelt as a master strategist, a reformer and his enduring influence on the American mind. 
The event was organized by Chairman of the Theodore Roosevelt Institute and great-grandson of President Roosevelt, Tweed Roosevelt. “We owe a great thanks to Tweed Roosevelt,” Dr. Kimberly Cline, university president, said. “We look forward to developing further symposia and academic conferences in the future.”
The conference kicked off on Sunday, Oct. 27, with a Roosevelt Film Festival. From 12 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., there were showings of “Theodore Roosevelt: A Cowboy’s Ride to the White House,” “The Indomitable Teddy Roosevelt,” and “The Wind and the Lion.”
On Monday, Oct. 28, students and members of the community were able to listen to keynote speaker, Karl Rove share the story of President Roosevelt’s beginning and his rise in American politics. Rove, who authored a book on President William McKinley, spoke about the relationship between the two presidents. He also offered insight on McKinley’s election and how Roosevelt came to be his vice president. 
The conference continued with several more speakers in breakout sessions throughout the day. On Tuesday, Oct. 29, students and members of the community attended the Roosevelt Medal Presentation Dinner, where Governor Andrew Cuomo, though not in attendance due to an emergency, was honored by Tweed Roosevelt and Dr. Cline with the inaugural Roosevelt Medal. In a description of the ceremony, Governor Cuomo was honored because, “much like President Roosevelt, Governor Cuomo’s life and experiences serve as an example to future generations that success is rooted in hard work, perseverance and dedication to core principles.”
Caroline Person, a freshman fashion merchandising major and lacrosse player, attended the dinner and found the festivities to be interesting. “Getting to meet all these new people has been a great networking experience and I’m happy I got to do it alongside my teammates,” she said. 
The conference concludes on Wednesday, Oct. 30, with four breakout sessions from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., and closing remarks from Tweed Roosevelt. For more information about the Theodore Roosevelt Institute, visit liu.edu/roosevelt.

Renovations are happening on campus to correlate with the new mascot and school colors, and returning students and staff have been talking about them since the start of the fall 2019 semester. These gradual alterations have some students questioning when the university intends to invest in areas in need of updates and improvements. 
When LIU announced it was merging Post and Brooklyn’s athletic departments in October 2018, students and faculty felt mixed emotions about the changes involved. 
“On the athletic Division I side, you see we changed our colors, director of facilities, Roy Fergus, said, “We used to be the LIU Pioneers here in Brookville and the LIU Blackbirds in Brooklyn, but now we’re the LIU Sharks,” he said.
Those who returned to the Brookville campus after summer break, walked into a school which appeared to be confused about its color scheme. 
“Since we’re rebranding, all the green was throwing that off. So, it’s a good thing that we’re getting the new colors to bring up everyone’s spirits,” said Isabella Lebrun, a freshman sports management major. She’s fond of the new colors but feels the school could have chosen wiser ways to spend students’ tuition.
Fergus explained the changes as “a strategic approach” for “One LIU,” as the school transforms from a liberal arts university to a teaching and research university. What students and faculty witness over time is the updating of facilities, according to Fergus. An example of an update is the repainting of all the doors in a building to university blue. “A lot of green has come and gone, so that’s what I meant by a refurbish or updating of the space.”
Lebrun, who lives on campus, visited the upperclassmen dorms and noticed a difference in their condition compared to her resident hall. “I feel like some of the money should be going back into the dorms, especially the freshmen dorms,” she said. “The freshmen dorm bathrooms have cracked ceilings and I feel like that could be handled better.”
Upkeep of the dorms is “part of operations,” according to Fergus, and “those kinds of things will continue as normal. There are fifty-five buildings on campus and Fergus expressed that going through all the facilities one by one to make sure they are working properly can take a lot of time. “If you see something, please let us know because safety is absolutely paramount to us,” he said. “Send us a request, because in general, we can’t be everywhere at once.”
Dining choices on campus is a matter in which Jeff Litzko, a freshman communications major, expressed his discontent. He enjoys the brighter atmosphere created by the new blue and gold accents, but agreed that the money should have been spent elsewhere like food services. 
“I really don’t care for Bamboo or any of the food here” he said. “I think some other college campuses have McDonald’s on campus, or some places to hang out, which is something that I don’t really see here.” 
Litzko is a commuter, so he isn’t largely familiar with the resident halls on campus, but the one time he did spend the night in one of the dorm buildings, his experience was less than satisfactory. 
“It was horrible. There was no air-conditioning. The dorm [walls] have white cinder blocks; it’s gross. I feel like the money should be going to where the kids live on campus and revitalize the dorms a little bit; just redo things the kids actually care about,” he said.
As much as some students wish to see other areas acknowledged, many don’t oppose the changes already in place. Griffin Jusko, a freshman finance major, was also pleased with the new colors, rather than the old green and gold, but thinks the school has a long way to go. 
“I feel like if the money was put more into the classrooms, to update them, they would be less gloomy and boring. A lot of them are from the late 1990s,” he said. Jusko isn’t the first to have noticed the outdated atmosphere in many of the older buildings.
“We are transforming in a way that is meant to be really helpful to students,” Fergus said. “It also puts us in this part of a higher learning echo system at a leadership level.” He reminded students that even if it’s something small, bring the issue to facility services’ attention. “Let us know so we can deal with it as quickly as possible.”
