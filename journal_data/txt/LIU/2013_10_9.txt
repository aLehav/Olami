On Oct. 21, the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts will host its annual Swing for Kids Golf and Tennis Tournament at The Creek Club in Locust Valley. For more than 20 years, the benefit has raised funds that have supported Arts Education at Tilles.
Every year members of the Tilles Center Council of Overseers (benefactors for the venue) and the Swing for Kids Committee (benefactors for the event itself), its patrons, and sponsors compete in golf and tennis events. Their participation is done through underwriting and ad contributions that raise money to profit Arts Education.
After the scheduled events take place, The Creek hosts an evening celebration for all in attendance that includes a live auction, which includes tickets to a one-week stay at the PGA National Golf Resort and suite tickets to an Islander’s game, a raffle drawing, and an awards ceremony for the event’s winners. The auction items are donated by local corporations such as Wit and Whim and The Waterfront Center, as well as by Tilles council members. All proceeds go towards providing workshops for schools and child-friendly performances for young students on Long Island.
“Every student deserves a comprehensive education that includes the arts,” said Stephanie Turner, Tilles Center director of Arts Education. “The need for creativity, innovation, and deep critical thinking skills are essential as our world becomes more interconnected and diverse each day.”
Turner elaborated the purpose of the Tilles’ sponsored Arts Education events: “Experiencing in-school workshops conducted by our artists and attending performances at Tilles Center allows students to interpret, analyze, and evaluate aesthetically by making connections to an array of cultural perspectives and ideas.”
Peter Tilles, the founding chairman for Swing for Kids, said, “The most important part of this event is what it enables Tilles Center to do for schoolchildren all over Long Island. All funds raised at Swing for Kids support the Arts Education Program at Tilles Center. Because of
[its] success, schools across the island can give their students what they often cannot provide, an educational arts experience.” Although Tilles supplements Arts Education series to over 40 schools in Nassau and Suffolk counties, the budgets at certain institutions make it difficult to provide bussing to these events.
“Arts Education is very important because it gives kids the opportunity to view the world in a new frame of mind,” stated Emma Barishman, a sophomore Musical Theatre major. “The first [live performance] I saw was “Beauty and the Beast” on Broadway, and it left me with the impression that everyone listened to show tunes growing up.”
Research from ArtsEdSearch, an online clearinghouse that collects and summarizes high quality arts education research studies and analyzes their implications for educational policy and practice, demonstrates that participation in the arts improves reading readiness,
fluency, and comprehension. According to the online source, research finds that arts education helps students exhibit more divergent thinking, and partaking in media arts have the potential to develop reading and writing skills for all youth.
Arts education is [crucial] to giving children a well-rounded education, [and we hope to] make sure that kids on Long Island are not short-changed in their education as a result of cuts in the arts,” said Tilles.
To encourage Long Island schoolchildren’s appreciation for the arts, Tilles will be hosting shows and supplementing tickets for performances of “Stuart Little” and “The Monster Who Ate My Peas” later in the season. The fundraiser gross can range from $200,000 to $350,000 with a net worth of $125,000 to $200,000 going directly toward Arts Education.

LIU Post loves social media; there are over 30 Post organizations and clubs on Twitter, nearly 60 on Facebook, and over 20 on Instagram. Included in the numbers are some of Post’s larger clubs and organizations: LIU Post Pioneers, the LIU Post Honors Program, LIU Post’s Male Soccer Team, the Association of Campus Programming, Twice as Nice, LIU Post’s Commuter Student Association, Residence Life, and many more.
More and more, LIU Post is utilizing social media as an active way to get students involved on campus. Post has a twitter account, with a group picture taken on the Great Lawn as its background image. Post’s twitter page is updated regularly, with over 2,000 times and has more than 1,000 followers. Residence Life at LIU Post has also recently created a Twitter, but it only has 13 followers so far and only one tweet. However, Resident Assistants have started spreading the word by slipping flyers under the doors of their residents.
For Myana Gray, a graduate Criminal Justice student and president of the Association of Campus Programming (ACP), social media is one of the more effective ways to advertise and inform students at LIU Post on what is going on. “Everyone is on social networks now and we try to use each and every [outlet] to get our information out,” Gray explains. She also believes that putting up posters and announcing upcoming events is also very effective. ACP has accounts with Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
There, ACP keeps students up to date with pictures, event information, and information on general meetings. ACP is separated into three groups: the Music Committee, the Special Events Committee, and the Public Relations Committee.
ACP’s Public Relations Committee handles the social media and campus advertising. “The Public Relations chair sends me flyers so I can post them on the ACP Instagram. That way, all of our followers know what events are coming up and refer back to them whenever they want,” Lillyna Dextre, a sophomore and Social Work major, stated. Dextre is a member of ACP’s Public Relations Committee. Each social media account that belongs to ACP and concerns its general members is open to those who want to find out what is going on and when the meetings are.
According to Bria-Letȃ Greene, a junior Business Marketing major and president of Twice as Nice, social media is also a great way to increase the group’s membership. Both Greene and her twin sister, Tia-Monȃ, believe that the usage of social media appeals to all students, but especially freshmen.
Greene believes that the freshmen are more curious about getting involved on campus so they pursue social media sites in search of clubs that interest them.
Greene also expresses how easy it is to keep up with the social media accounts for their club. “From Instagram, you can connect all your other social media accounts.” Bria-Letȃ explains that it is also important to use social media to support the sense of community between clubs on campus and students in general. “We also help advertise other clubs events and wish everybody a happy birthday!” Twice as Nice can be found on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr. Tia-Monȃ Greene uses Tumblr as one of the ways to share all the pictures she takes at her club’s events, as well as all other events.
Social media has proven to be a great way to keep in touch with friends and family over the years, but LIU Post has caught up with the times. Now nearly all of Post’s clubs and organizations are involved with one or more social media sites, using them

When you are in the library studying, and your friend calls and asks if you want to talk for a bit, what do you do? Well, something you might not know is that The B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library at LIU Post has a no-cell phone policy.
The policy is in place to ensure that students, faculty and others who try to work in the library can work with minimum disruption. If you wander around the library, you will see small signs that state that there is to be no cell phone usage in the area.
Eduardo Rivera, the head of Reference Services, stated that there have been no major problems with anyone regarding the enforcement of the policy. “People are usually not aware that they are loud,” said Rivera. He also added that people are usually very apologetic and they hang up or take their call someplace else.
Rivera characterized the no-cell phone policy as “a soft cell phone policy,” and that the library staff asks students to be discreet when using their cell phones while in the library. The library staff enforces the policy only when people are being disruptive, but if students are discreet they do not see it as a problem.
When asked if he thought that the no-cell phone policy was effective, Rivera replied, “Yes, generally students are good about it and there’s rarely been an issue.”
Junior Accounting major William Bernal did not know that there was a no-cell phone policy in place. Bernal said that he had experienced disruptiveness by someone using his or her cell phone in the library and, “nobody did anything about it.” Bernal added that people should go outside if they wanted to use their cell phones, and that they should also put it on silent mode.
Just like Bernal, Junior Health Sciences major Zorayda Perez did not know about the no-cell phone policy in the library. Perez has never experienced anything negative with cell phone usage in the library, but added that there should be a policy in place that says, “People should turn their phones on silent.” Perez added that she did not want a “strict policy”.
Biology sophomore Melissa Aben did notice a no-cell phone sign when she was about to make a call. When asked if she had ever experienced a problem with disturbance regarding cell phone usage in the library, she said, “Never been a problem.” She also added that there should be a no-cell phone policy “because it is a quiet space.”
For students and others who use their phones in the library, the staff urges discretion so one does not disturb others.
Failure to comply with the rules will result in warnings, and one may even be asked to leave.

Whether you have lactose or gluten intolerance, or just prefer to eat less processed foods, more restaurants are offering diners different options that cater to their lifestyles. These alternative menu choices are popping up along the South Shore of Long Island. Also, vegetarianism and veganism are becoming increasingly popular in several of these and other eating establishments across the south shore.
Ashley Lilly, a junior English major, states, “I’ve been a vegetarian for five years. It can be hard to find food at restaurants at times, but I feel I have a lot more vegetables in my diet. It can also challenge others’ creativity with meals.”
To those with lactose intolerance, dairy products can pose a threat. Lactose is a main component of processed dairy, and can be difficult to digest. Celiac disease, a gluten related allergy, causes the lower intestines to become inflamed and tear from forced digestion of gluten. The protein is found in processed wheat products, such as bagels, breads, and pasta.
Fortunately, there are two restaurants along the South Shore that are offering healthier, allergy-free options for everyone to enjoy.
Located in Bellmore, N.Y, at 2572 Merrick Rd., and opened in July 2010, is the gluten and nut-free establishment known as Bare Naked Bakery and Cafe. Owner Bridget Brennan’s primary goal to adhere to is the “dedication to being 100% nut-free and gluten-free.” When it came to designing the bakery, she “wanted to create a normal atmosphere.”
“When you go to pizzeria, you order an entire pizza to go. Here, I wanted people to grab a bagel and coffee; sit, relax and eat,” Bridget adds. Panini sandwiches, pizza, and breakfast sandwiches, in addition to various confectionaries and breads, are also on the menu.
Further down the shore, on 3000 Long Beach Rd., in Oceanside, NY, is Jandi’s Natural Market and Organic Cafe. Opened in 1976, Jandi’s offers customers not only a gluten-free experience, but an organic one as well. According to Manager Paige Callanan, who is vegan herself, Jandi’s most popular dish is their Brown Rice Pizza. “It’s gluten-free and non-dairy. It’s made with lactose-free cheese, organic tomato sauce, and a rice-based crust, and it’s topped with assorted organic grilled veggies.” Jandi’s also hosts a true organic and kosher deli.
Alyssa Casano, a senior Childhood Education major, sympathizes with the gluten-free community, and said, “I have a friend who is gluten-free and whenever we are out together, she always has to eat something bland like a hamburger without a bun or plain chicken.”
Other restaurants, which cater to vegan and allergy-free alternatives, include Tula Kitchen in Bayshore, 3 Brothers Pizzeria in Rockville Center, and Bob’s Natural Foods in Long Beach. So whether you have food allergies, or want to try eating vegan, these eateries will cater to your needs.

One of the many things students living on campus look forward to every year is meeting the person they will be sharing a room with for the next nine months. Many imagine what their roommate will be like. It is great to be optimistic about living with someone else and to at least attempt to get used to their way of living to avoid confrontations from time to time, but what do you do when living with your roommate becomes a total nightmare?
Every year, numerous students wish to change rooms. The reason for the room change can range from small things, such as constant messiness, to extreme things, such as just pure dislike for the person you have to room with.
When a student registers to live on campus, they get a form that lists different characteristics of people: loud, messy, sociable. The student must then check off the characteristics they wish to have in a roommate. After these forms are filled out the student is matched with someone whose form looked similar to their own. It’s basically like filling out an application on an online dating website. The goal is to put two very similar people in the same room to avoid any conflicts.
This system may work sometimes, but the system also has its flaws. The form that lists what you want in a roommate does not dive deep into other personality and social traits. So besides not being loud or messy, what are the things most students want in a roommate? Here are some roommate “dos and don’ts.”
The most important rule when living with another person is to respect their things. A roommate not being in the room at a certain time is no excuse to touch their things, or decide it is okay to borrow their clothing without permission. This is considered stealing and is something that most individuals will not tolerate. This can cause major problems between both roommates and can even at some point have to involve the Residence Hall Director (RHD).
Another important rule when sharing a room with someone else is to keep your things and visitors on your side of the room. No one wants to come back from a long day of class to find their roommate’s friends sprawled out on their bed. This is both disrespectful and just plain annoying. A roommate should also never leave food out for days at a time. This can cause bugs and disgusting odors. It is never a good thing to be the dirty roommate.
Roommates should also know the things that they should do as well. A good roommate always does their best to respect their roommate, especially on the days before midterms and finals. If they wish to study in the privacy of their dorm room, their roommate should respect that.
Another important thing roommates should always do, not only for themselves, but for the person they are living with as well, is shower. Being hygienic is not only beneficial to you, but it’s also to the people around you. No one wants to know you were at the gym all day because you smell like sweat.
Matthew McMahon, a junior Broadcasting major, said, “The perfect roommate is someone you can leave alone in the room and not have to worry about. It would be terrible to have to worry about someone messing with your stuff or destroying the room whenever you need to leave for class or go home.”
Being a good roommate is not a hard thing to do. Here are some reminders: Always ask before touching, sharing can be a good thing, and respect the people around you. Those who do currently have a bad roommate situation and do not know how to deal with it should contact their RHD. These situations can be easily handled and sorted out before it becomes serious. College is a time for memories, success, and laughs. Knowing the “dos and don’ts” of being a good roommate can help contribute to

There is a feud over the shuttle and its service. Some don’t mind, while others complain that they should add more hours on weekends or that they should fix their schedule. I am one of the students that aren’t as content with the bus service. Whether I’m going to Lorber Hall or Broadway Mall, I always find myself waiting five to 10 minutes more than the time it is scheduled to come. But that isn’t the issue for me; in fact, I don’t mind waiting a few minutes for the shuttle if it gets me to where I want to go.
The real issue for me is that the shuttle stops working at 9 p.m., on Monday-Thursdays. On the weekends, it runs from 12 to 5 p.m., which is ridiculous. The shuttle also has a gap from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., where it is not running. This becomes frustrating for commuters who need to get to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) station in Hicksville and cannot because the shuttle is too full to fit any more students at 4 p.m.
My theory is if they run the service all day the shuttle would be emptier in the afternoon because the commuters who finish classes during common hour can go home and not have to wait for the 4 p.m. shuttle.
Also, for people who might have jobs in the mall, it’ll be more convenient if the shuttle operated after 9 p.m., because the student would be able to take it back to campus.
Ileana Lado, sophomore Psychology major, said, “It would be much more convenient if the shuttle ran longer night hours and came more frequently.”
The shuttle should also make a habit of going to the Hicksville Station first so the commuters can take the earlier train and not have to wait twenty minutes for the next train to come to the station.
I do believe that the shuttle service is doing its best. However, some changes have to be made so it can accommodate the students

Imagine yourself, a senior in high school – way back when! And imagine yourself sitting in your room thinking about college. What were you most excited for – higher education? That’s doubtful.
It’s nice to think that advancing ourselves is the first thing we get excited about when it comes to college, but such a scenario is most likely not the case. So, imagining that you are a senior in high school, what is it that you think about regarding college when you close your eyes? Parties, bars, and fun, right?
If that is the case, don’t feel ashamed! You were not alone when you imagined college as being a sanctuary of fun – who says it isn’t? Fun is a subjective term.
Maybe you are one of those people who still associates college with partying, and maybe that works for you. But if you ask me, being successful in college does not leave room for excessive partying and drinking. I’ve learned that, when it comes to college, my fun is actually not partying or drinking at all.
That is not to say that I feel drinking and fun can’t exist in college, because that is not the case at all. I know plenty of people who party in moderation and manage with school just fine. In fact, a little partying here and there can actually be a good stress reliever, as long as your nightly activities don’t become too physically draining or negatively influence your success in class.
Stephanie Morales, a sophomore studying Art Therapy, manages her time so that she has one night a week to let loose. “I’m not a major drinker at all, but if I do drink, it’s usually only a little bit on the weekends after a really long week. It just helps me to relax a little more and takes away from some of the stress throughout the week,” She said.
I, on the other hand, have absolutely no time for partying or drinking. Between work and school, my weekends are jam-packed – besides, I just don’t like the way being drunk feels. I was never one to have the energy to stay up all night partying and drinking, but again, that’s just me! I actually admire the people who go out and party all the time while still maintaining a 3.5 Grade Point Average (GPA).
We are all different, and we all know our limits. As long as you know when to stop – assuming that your grades matter to you – there is nothing wrong with drinking and partying in moderation.
With that said, if you are reading this and you feel that you are one of those people who excessively parties to the point where you may be overdoing it, then maybe you should reevaluate your priorities. Try to remember that this is college, and college is no joke. Don’t let a few impulsive actions ruin your college career.
Consider that, at this age, we have plenty of time to party outside of the school year. Summer vacation is almost four months long! In that case, it is probably a good idea to find other ways of having fun during the school year so that overdoing it can’t be an option. We all know how easy it is to pass up a night of studying for a night on the town.
There are so many productive ways of having fun that don’t require alcohol. In fact, partying without alcohol is actually a whole lot of fun. I’ve been to a whole bunch of sober parties – movie nights, twister competitions, craft parties, etc. So don’t let going out and drinking be your only option when it comes to having fun or relieving stress. There are other options out there – you just have to be more open to them.

On Sept. 30, Justin Timberlake released his fourth studio album, the 20/20 Experience Part 2, just six months after the debut of the first part. Timberlake’s comeback was greatly anticipated and welcomed after his last album release in 2006. Following several song and movie features and being married to actress Jessica Biel in October 2012, Timberlake has returned happier than ever.
The 20/20 Experience is, evidently, a sweet serenade to his newlywed and a general celebration of life. The album is a compilation of soul, R&B, and a little hint of pop. In past years, Timberlake has adopted the R&B title and moved further away from his N’SYNC roots. Teaming up with rappers like T.I. for the single “Dead and Gone” or 50 Cent’s “Ayo Technology” aided in Timberlake’s transformation, giving him a sense of street credit. This also altered the viewpoints of his fans, separating him from other male singers like Justin Bieber and Bruno Mars. He uses his vast musical abilities to his advantage in Parts one and two, creating entirely different experiences than previous albums Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds. Timbaland produced both Parts one and two, giving the tracks their signature R&B beats.
Most songs from Part One are more than five minutes long; reflecting the 70’s and 80’s, an era with music like Marvin Gaye’s “Got To Give It Up” and Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Starting Something.” The 20/20 Experience Part Two continues with lengthy tracks with the entire album running about 74 minutes, making it longer than Part One. Similar genres remain in Part Two, displaying a darker, sexier side of Timberlake almost as if he’s up for a wild night out compared to Part One, where he’s on cloud nine.
The first single on the album, “Take Back The Night,” continues the R&B theme and groovy production seen in Part One. “TKO” was the second single released earlier in September. The song is an upbeat seven-minute track using an old-school Timberland beat and boxing puns. Both singles demonstrate the direction Timberlake took in Part Two of the 20/20 Experience, using less pop and more soulful R&B rhythms with Hip-Hop beats. Songs like “Drink You Away” and “Blindness” especially capture a soulful feel. Timberlake’s effort and hard work is apparent on this album, creating an entirely unique project from Part One. Growth and quality is always guaranteed from a Timberlake project as he works to expand and mesmerize his audience by pushing his limits. Unlike many albums that are littered with features, Timberlake limits artist appearances on his work to
fully display his talents. After being featured in Part One’s hit single “Suit and Tie,” Jay Z reappears in Part Two, giving the song “Murder” a Hip-Hop twist. The only other feature is Drake’s verse on the song “Cabaret,” which came off as mediocre and could have been done without.
The 20/20 Experience Part Two expresses different aspects of Timberlake and his musical abilities though still capturing his key elements which fans have grown to love. “True Blood” and “Gimme What I Don’t Know” are tracks made to get you out of your seat to perform your best JT dance moves, similar to his earlier hit “Rock Your Body.” This is a great quality for Timberlake in being able to create upbeat, fun music that differs from usual pop hits. The song “You Got It On” is a slower track that Timber
lake uses to show off his rich vocals reminiscent of songs like “Mirrors” and “That Girl” from Part One. Timberlake did an amazing job in establishing a new genre for himself on the 20/20 Experience Part One, experimenting with soulful vocals and lyrics, Motown inspired themes and live band performances. Continuing these themes beautifully in Part Two, he created a whole new project that reveals his music ability as endless. With that said, the 20/20 Experiences Part Two earns a rating of 8 out of 10 for overall quality, musical development and the unique compilation of genres used to uphold an entertaining and positive message. Part Two is last but definitely not least; Timberlake’s talent refuses to dwindle as his skills and potential grow with each album.

After releasing EPs and singles, touring constantly, and making a name for themselves since 2006, indie-pop band Haim has recorded their first-full length album “Days are Gone.” The album was released on Sept. 30 through Polydor Records. Four positively received singles were released before the album, building up anticipation. Haim did not disappoint. “Days are Gone” is easily one of the best indie-pop albums of 2013.
Sisters Este, Danielle, and Alana Haim, with Dash Hutton, formed the band in 2006. Since then, they have honed their craft, mixing the sounds of Fleetwood Mac with artists and bands like Destiny’s Child, Madonna, and Pat Benatar. It is an eclectic mix, and forms the basis of who Haim is: a fun-sounding and enjoyable band.
Vocally, the Haim sisters and Hutton really complement each other. The vocals are not drowned in reverb like plenty of indie-pop bands, and it is quite refreshing. A great mix of lead and backing vocals is quite apparent on the single, “The Wire.” The vocals work into the music very well.
The music doesn’t sound over-done or ruined by the arrogance of one member. As stated previously for vocals, each member and their instrumentation work well together in a unified way. What really ties all of the wonderful qualities together is the production, done primarily by the three sisters and James Ford. Ford is a brilliant producer, working for the likes of Simian (his own band), Arctic Monkeys, The Last Shadow Puppets, and Klaxons. His production is definitely not cheap and it’s fresh to hear his production quality over others such as Rick Rubin or Jay-Z (whose label signed Haim).
Ford’s work in Simian and Simian Mobile Disco really helped the quality sound of the indie-pop Haim has created. Ford found critical acclaim in his work with the bands, and I hope that his work with Haim continues. Haim, while proving themselves as good producers, could always use the back-up, and Ford is the man to find the help in.
As for the album as a whole, it is one of the catchiest released recently. “Days are Gone” is an album that can be played again and again without getting old. Haim has really created a masterpiece, reminiscent of the breakout releases such as “Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not” by Arctic Monkeys, as well as “Is This It” by The Strokes. If their debut is any indicator, Haim have a very bright future ahead of them.
I recommend this for indie fans, fans of female vocalists, someone looking for a good new pop album, and fans of talented musicians and lyricists.
Key Tracks: “The Wire,” “Don’t Save Me,” “My Song Five,” and “Running If You Call My Name”
Rating: 9/10

The women’s volleyball team is a force to be reckoned with after winning three out of three contests last week. Three ECC opponents stepped onto the court and the Pioneers brushed all three aside, dropping only one set in all three games, moving them to 4-0 in the conference and 13-3 for the season.
First up were local rivals NYIT on Tuesday, Oct. 1 in the Battle of the Boulevard. The battle was short-lived as the Pioneers tossed aside the previously unbeaten Bears 3-0. The first set was 25-20, the second 25-22, and the final 25-21. As usual, freshman outside hitter Shelby McCool continued to shine as she finished with a season high of 17 kills. Junior setter Lulu Centro continued her assisting power, throwing up 35.
Next up was Mercy College at the Pratt Center on Thursday Oct. 3, as the Pioneers again rolled over their ECC foes 3-0. The first set went 25-15, followed by much of the same in the second set, as Post won 25-17. The trend continued in the final set as the mighty green and gold made it rain on Mercy, knocking them down 25-11. Senior middle blocker Makamae Namahoe racked
up her fifth double of the season with 12 kills and 11 digs.
In their final match of the week, the green and gold stepped up to play Queens College on Saturday, Oct. 5 at Queens. The Pioneers jumped the first hurdle, winning 25-23, before dropping their first set of the week 25-18 as the Knights posted their answer. But it wasn’t enough as McCool continued to knock down everything she was given, an incredible double-double from the freshman. At the same time, Centro tallied a season best of 21 kills and 19 digs. With an attack like that, the Knights had nothing to answer back with in the third and fourth sets as the Pioneers won those 25-16 and 25-21 leading to a victory on the road. Centro tallied 46 assists on the day while sophomore libero Rachel Ringor dug out 28 for the team.
“These were three important ECC games that we felt we had to win and we did so playing some really good volleyball,” said Namahoe on the week’s matches. “This is a promising season so far and hopefully we will continue to win.”
The Pioneers return to action on Thursday, Oct. 10 at Molloy College at 7 p.m. in another important ECC clash.

They’re going to the top and can’t be stopped. The men’s soccer team brings its record to 10-0 after a pair of victories at home against the Roberts Wesleyan College Redhawks and the Daemen College Wildcats last weekend.
The Pioneers welcomed the Redhawks on Friday, Oct. 4. The first period nearly ended scoreless. With just four minutes left in the half, senior back Eirik Bjoernoe scored the first goal of the game with a penalty kick. The Pioneers kept their momentum going when sophomore mid- fielder Per Forgaard scored the second goal off
an assist from junior back Oscar Kjellstrom. That goal came just under 15 minutes after the start
of the second half. The Redhawks didn’t even have the opportunity to take a shot before junior forward Eivind Austboe scored the Pioneers’ third goal, assisted by Forgaard. The Redhawks fought hard, but not hard enough. The game ended before they were able to score. The final score of 3-0 brought the Pioneers to their ninth win of the season.
“Sunday Funday” indeed, for the Pioneers
at least. The Wildcats played at Post on Sunday, Oct. 6. The Wildcats wasted no time. Kyle Clifford managed to score the first goal of the game for the away team under four minutes into the game. It took the Pioneers about 20 minutes to answer.
Austboe scored for the Pioneers with assists from senior midfielder Jonathon Watkin and sophomore midfielder Matias Ruiz.
That was just the beginning. Austboe scored a second goal less than 15 minutes later off an as- sist from sophomore back Carl Lystad. Less than five minutes later, Lystad scored a goal of his own off an assist from Forgaard. About two minutes later, it was Bjoernoe’s turn to score off a penalty kick. Less than a minute later, Austboe kicked in his third goal of the game off an assist by senior forward Cemil Turan.
That was five goals for the Pioneers in the first half, and the momentum didn’t stop then. Less than 10 minutes into the second period, freshman forward Johann Kristjansson scored off an assist from junior midfielder Dusan Gargurev- ich. Junior midfielder Vincent Tavernese scored his first goal of the season, also off an assist
from Gargurevich. A penalty kick by Turan and a header by sophomore forward Cameron Gamble added up to nine goals for the Pioneers. The Wildcats were unable to keep up. The Pioneers defeated the Wildcats easily by a score of 9-1.
The Pioneers will go on the road to take on the Nyack College Warriors on Wednesday, Oct. 9 at 3:30 p.m., and again on Saturday, Oct. 12 at 3:00 p.m. to play the University of Bridgeport Purple Knights.

After scoring six goals this past Friday in their 6-1 victory over Roberts Wesleyan College, the green and gold made it their mission to continue excellent play for the weekend.
It was only seven minutes before senior forward Alexa Niciforo got her squad on the board this Sunday afternoon versus the visiting Daemen College. Niciforo would strike again for her second goal of the afternoon in the second half off of an assist from freshman midfielder Julia Backman. Shortly after, Backman contributed to the score sheet with a goal of her own placing the ball in the back of the net for the Pioneers third and final goal of the afternoon.
The action in front of the Pioneers net was quite scarce as they dominated and outshot their Wildcat opponents by a margin of 36-2. Freshman goalkeepers Hreffie Agnarsdottir and Felicia Orderud had one save apiece on the afternoon to secure the shutout for the Pioneers.
With this weekend’s victories, the Pioneers have improved to 7-2 overall, and 3-1 in the East Coast Conference. “I’m very pleased with our performance this weekend,” said Head Coach Mark Dawson about his team’s stellar performance, including scoring nine goals and only allowing one during the last two wins. “With that being said, there’s always room for improvement and we look forward to working on getting to the next level as a team.”
Coach Dawson and the Pioneers are back in action Wednesday, Oct. 9 as they head to Lakewood, N.J. to take on Georgian Court University. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m.
