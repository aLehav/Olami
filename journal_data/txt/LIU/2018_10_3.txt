The office of Campus Life and LIU Promise made changes to the student organization manual and five star accreditation rubric this summer. The changes took effect at the start of the fall 2018 semester, and club organizations will have to adapt the way they operate to meet the new standards.
“The Five-Star program has been re-worked top to bottom in order to align more closely with the values of our campus community and to remove potential obstacles for student success,” said Joseph Vernace, senior associate director of campus life.
The goal is to increase community engagement with student organizations, according to Vernace. “[We] believe that we have created a more accessible pipeline for new student organizations to start on our campus,” he said.
Among the changes made to the five star rubric are: fulfilling administrative requirements on time – these include a registration form, executive officer GPA release and advisor agreement due prior to the start of classes each semester, and a semester report, meeting minutes and event evaluation due prior to the last day of classes each semester; and meeting attendance requirements, including the campus involvement fair, club leadership training, the student leadership reception and campus wide events.
There are also requirements for community engagement, including holding monthly general meetings, weekly executive board meetings, establishing a campus tradition, hosting a social or educational program and running a co-sponsored event; membership requirements, where a club must have at least 10 members to reach a three star accreditation; philanthropy and community service requirements, where clubs must donate at least $125 to a national or local service organization and complete at least two hours of community service per active member.
Some club leaders find the changes easy to understand, including Coalition for Conservation president Charlotte Beshers. “They were very clear cut in terms of what is expected of clubs and what the consequences will be if they are not met,” she said. Beshers, a sophomore double major in adolescent education and math, is president of the club for the first time.
The coalition earned five star status at the end of the spring 2018 semester, and Beshers said they are on track to maintaining the title. Last semester, members of the coalition raised money towards relief efforts for those in Puerto Rico affected by hurricane Maria. They will continue to donate to relief efforts this semester. The coalition will also partner with the fashion and merchandising club this semester to bring awareness to “fast fashion,” the mass production of clothing and the harmful environmental consequences it poses.
Other clubs, like the Be the Change club, have already adapted to the changes this fall semester. One of the updates includes a new online submission form to submit required documents. “Last year, we had to put everything into a Google Drive folder and fill out a bunch of things on there which got pretty time consuming, and it was sometimes easy to lose track of things,” said Adam Silverstein, a junior social work major and founder and president of the Be the Change club. “[The forms] are easier to use and simpler. I think it’ll help us keep track of things much more easily and the whole thing feels more organized than before,” he continued.
The Be the Change obtained their five-star ranking in the spring 2018 semester. “We got that rank by doing a lot of programming throughout last year and holding a number of successful events. Also, we have a bunch of active members that contribute a lot to the club,” Silverstein said. The Be the Change club has more than 30 active members this fall semester. They meet weekly during common hour every Thursday in Hillwood Commons room 221.
The changes to the five-star program will not impact student organization budgets, according to Vernace. The Student Government Association oversees initial recognition of new student organizations, as well the budget allocations for all student organizations. “To receive a budget, a club needs to be meeting at least a three star accreditation and must have requested a budget within the proper time frame through SGA,” said Erica Ferrara, senior geology and environmental sustainability major and SGA vice president.
LIU Promise and SGA are constantly in contact about changes that will affect the student body, according to Ferrara. “Everything we had come to them with about last year in regards to clubs having difficulty fulfilling the old five star [rubric] was taken into account and reflected in this new accreditation program,” she said.
“Significant model changes like this is not a regular occurrence; however, we will be monitoring the success of the program closely and make small improvements when necessary,” Vernace said.
The five-star accreditation program for student organizations and university policies pertaining to student organizations are outlined in detail on the online Student Organization Hub at: www.tinyurl.com/PostLIUPromise.

Hi all Pioneers,
Way back in 1978, I began as a ghost writer for The Pioneer. The following year, I wrote both sports and campus articles for The Pioneer. It is indeed, a vital part of campus life and was a great experience. Years later, I often still read The Pioneer as a good source of information of LIU Post. Of course in 1978, it was CW POST. When I graduated from Post in May of 1980, My Pioneer memories were made and they are always with me. KEEP THE PIONEER AND DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING!!!!!!!! IT IS VITAL FOR LIU POST!!!!!!!!!!!

College can often be stressful; it makes and breaks you. Obligations can be difficult for everyone, whether a faculty member, administrator or student. College concludes the teenage years and begins the path of adulthood, but that doesn’t change the fact that people still enjoy themselves.
When asked what she likes to do in her free time, Ashley Herkommer, a junior digital art design major, blurted out “sit on people’s faces” and her friends bursted out laughing. As strange as they are, students have many different hobbies to indulge in after school.

Students like Kiernan Griffin, a sophomore art therapy major, enjoy “[watching] Netflix, art and hanging out with friends” in their free time. While these hobbies are widely shared amongst the campus community, doing the activity itself just scratches the surface.
Zhexu Zheng, a junior political science major, enjoys “martial arts, reading, and playing piano, sometimes alone or with others.” Zheng, among many students find that the best hobbies are the ones where you can express yourself. Often times these activities can be shared with others. It’s not only about what you do to enjoy yourself, but who you choose to spend time with while engaging in your favorite activities.
A favorite pastime shared by many students is attending events during Homecoming weekend. “[There is] a sense of community and bonding,” Herkommer said, and her friends agreed. “We like being surrounded by people who are energetic and are spirited,” she continued.
Despite being a necessity, eating is another pastime some students enjoy together. Vinny Torelli, a sophomore radiology major, said that eating in a group “makes you feel safe, that’s why you eat in a circle. We’re watching each other’s backs. I feel like I won’t get snuck up on.” That seemed to be the consensus as his lunch group of friends laughed and agreed.
Torelli continued, saying that being in a comfortable setting with people you like allows a person to be themselves. It helped emulate the identity of the students; people who are enjoying themselves.
Despite the varying activities of each student, they all shared one common thought, they liked spending time with each other. Griffin and her friends sit and eat at the same table in Hillwood Commons everyday since freshman year. “We all like meeting up during common hour. This is the only time we get to see each other,” Griffin said. They do their best to make the most out of it. Hanging out with the people around you can be refreshing.

There are many opportunities on campus to hold leadership positions and join clubs where you can make friends, learn new skills, and contribute to the campus community. The most important step to get involved in college is recognizing where your interests lie. This is a list of five ways that students can get involved on campus and make the most of their four years.
Look within your major 
Often, there are specific clubs that relate to college majors. For example, if you are nursing student, you can get involved in the nursing club. The nutrition club is perfect for student studying nutrition or anyone with an interest in nutrition and health. By putting one of these clubs on your resume, you will be a more well-rounded applicant for jobs.
Get involved in Greek life 
On our campus, there are Panhellenic organizations for women who want to get involved in a sorority, and fraternities for men. Getting involved in Greek life is a great way to meet new people on campus and expand your horizons. Sororities and fraternities sponsor many events, such as philanthropic drives and sisterhood/brotherhood events to grow closer to members of your sorority or fraternity.
Try a sports team
For those who enjoy athletics, there are many club sports teams on campus that are looking for interested members. If you are interested in riding horses, you could join the equestrian club team, which allows students with varying levels of proficiency to get involved. You can also join a club team such as flag football, and find a community while also getting a good source of exercise.
Explore other interests 
College is often a stressful time in the lives of students. A great way to spend your time is to join a club that you are interested outside of your major. Some examples are Be the Change club, which promotes positivity on campus, or Runway, the school’s fashion club.
 Find a leadership position 
Getting involved in a leadership organization is a great way to spend your time. Examples are the Student Government Association, which helps students to talk with administrators to better their college experience. Students can also get involved in leadership honor societies, such as Gamma Sigma Alpha or Order of Omega.
By getting involved on campus, you will better spend your college years, meet new people and form lasting connections.

Students often say they are busy bees, but what is it that makes them buzz, and how do they handle the work?
Each person has a different way to cope with stress. With balancing school, jobs, extracurriculars or fun side projects and hobbies, it can be a circus act attempting to juggle all of these along with family, a social life, and relationships.
For Ashley Herkommer, a junior digital art and design student, it’s exhausting. “[Being] busy can mean a lot of things for me, depending on the person [I’m talking to]. Usually I’m always working or I’m sleeping because I’m tired from work,” she said.
“For me busy is mainly schoolwork and a job, because I prefer to be around people. I’m not gonna lie about being busy unless I am,” Paris Romano, a sophomore digital art and design major, said. He has a part-time job on campus in the admissions office. “That’s a good time to get work done,” he added.
Kelly-Ann Rivera, a senior film major, juggles work and school. However, due to a temporary injury, she is less busy than she was before. “I wish I were more busy whenever I feel lazy and don’t want to do anything, [but] there are times where I can sit, lie down and not have anything to do,” she said. School work comes first for Rivera. “Sometimes I would have to cancel plans to do schoolwork,” she said.
Rachel Portnoy, a junior education major, has a full student life that involves academics, socializing and club and campus involvement. “I have a lot of assignments and homework to do and I have to study for a lot of tests and a lot of events to attend,” Portnoy said. Her key to success is organization. “I find that I’m really good at handling all the responsibilities using my planner,” she said.
Portnoy makes time to socialize with her friends and get her things done by scheduling her plans. “I try not to make too many excuses,” she said.
Not every student manages their busy lives as well as others. For some like Brianna LiCausi, a senior health and physical education major, the workload can be overwhelming. “When I’m busy, I’ve overpacked my schedule to the point where my brain wants to explode,” LiCausi said. “I am stressed all the time, especially as a college student, because when I get more stressed I just jam pack events together so I don’t worry about the time I don’t have, which piles on each other,” she said.
LiCausi wants to be less busy, but she also feels a need for a “jam-packed” life in order to feel engaged and active. “If I was less busy in my life I think I’d be a little more stress-free, probably a little bored because stress makes my life crazy and kind of adventurous. I feel like I wouldn’t have so much anxiety all the time,” she said. LiCausi’s schedule includes work, school, sorority life, looking out for her friends and roommate, club memberships, babysitting, socializing and “embarrassing [herself] in Hillwood.”
Being busy can have a varied impact on students’ lives, but there is a thread that connects many students: a constant striving to manage it all.

Meet Professor Joan Digby. She’s been director of the honors program and an English professor for 50 years at LIU Post. She graduated with her M.A. from the University of Delaware and a B.A. and Ph.D from New York University. She can now add “drone aficionado” to her resumé.
Something completely new for Digby, she has been hard at work learning all there is to know about drones. “Why did this happen? First of all I’m in the English department and the [drone] class is in media arts, so how did it happen,” she asked.
Professor Benjamin Gerdes, who was scheduled to teach the course on drones this semester, is on leave for a year, so Digby stepped in. “I spent the summer learning about drones and here I am – now in my own drone class. I figured when I announced that I’d be teaching it, everybody would drop out and it would go away, but then people joined the class,” she said.
Digby has changed the course material for her students. “We actually started with the linguistic backgrounds of the word ‘drone’ which is a medieval word referring to ‘a low humming sound.’ Then for the next lesson, I followed up with music that had drone instruments in them like Indian Raga music or Australian didgeridoos,” she said.
She has also discussed bees and the “drones in the hive.” Digby is now beginning to explore actual drones and their ethical, agricultural and military uses and implications.
Lauren Gissentanna, senior musical theater major, is enjoying her time in the drone class. Digby is “a great woman and a fun professor,” she said. “What I like about her classes is that they feel more like a seminar rather than an actual lecture class. We sit and talk around the table and we’re all just on the same level.”
Gissentanna added that she enjoys Digby’s method on breaking the “student-level barrier” with her being almost student-like herself and learning this with the class. Although drones are new to Digby, she is not stepping away from the challenge. “I never like to teach the same thing again and again because then I don’t learn anything and I don’t get new ideas,” she said. “It’s been a big learning curve, but a fabulous experience. So for me, doing new things is what keeps me going. I don’t like repeating what I always have done – it’s boring, extremely boring. I need new things to do.”
Students who missed the drone class this semester may be in luck. Normally, honors electives are not often repeated, but Digby feels that with the world changing so exponentially, she’ll have a whole new lesson on drones to teach in the near future. “I could see that within another year they (drones) could be used in different ways, much different ways,” she said.

“This crew of 21 is some of the most talented human beings I’ve worked with, and that includes students and professionals and all kinds of company members,” Melanie Armer, freelance director of Post Theatre Company’s upcoming production of “Ubu Roi“ said. “This is a really hard working and talented group of people.”
During the final week of rehearsals, all of the usual who’s who or who’s putting in the most effort in their role, seemed to melt away as everyone worked together as a cohesive and well oiled “debraining machine.”
The cast members were working in sync with each other, jumping right into the work without missing a beat or taking a short pause from the warm up. The cast’s action can truly described by one word — ensemble.
“The sense of ensemble, here [in a PTC production] is easier to build than in a professional production where you have a scattering of people from different walks of life,” Armer noted. “Although there’s a tremendous diversity within this cast, the university setting and the way LIU runs the theater program both really support a sense of unity and a sense of ensemble work within the broader company that is LIU Post. These 21 people are prepared for the kind of work that it takes to be an ensemble and they’re excited about it,” Armer said.
The ensemble work was echoed by Logan Clingan, a junior musical theater major, who plays the part of Ubu Roi. He noted, “How collaborative the ensemble has made the piece; the comedic parts of the show are found through the ensemble.”
“Ubu Roi,” by Alfred Jarry, is “an incredibly intelligent incredibly dark play about fascism.” But also, “it’s the funniest piece of theater I’ve worked on, in ten years,” Armer said. “This play was written a long time ago, and in presenting this production it was really important to us, me and the design team and the department, to not set it in 2018 America. To allow the play to talk about the fact that fascism has been going on a long time; it’s a recurring theme in politics. It’s a world theme; it’s not just America, it’s not just Germany, it’s not just Trump, it’s not just Hitler. It was going on in France, it was going on in Poland, it was going on all over the place and it’s going on all over the place now, and so to treat that in a comic way, it’s a tremendous joy, because how else do you deal with that kind of pain, other than to bring it to the fore and really get into people’s minds by laughing, get into people’s minds by finding the comedy of it,” Armer said.
“Ubu Roi” is in a category called theater of the absurd, which means it seems nonsensical in nature but has a message worked into it (usually). When working on a play governed by absurdity, not realism, it can be tough to develop character.
There are “growing pains,” said Emileigh Aungst, a junior musical theater major, who plays the part of Ma Roi. Once Aungst found her character, she grew to like Ma Roi. “She’s silly and I love it because I get to bring a lot of myself into it,” Aungst said.
Clingan, who plays Ubu Roi, has also developed his character. “I love that I have total freedom to do what I want with this character. He wants as much power as he can and it’s so much fun to use the different ways to get that power,” Clingan said.
“Ubu Roi” opens in the Little Theater main stage on Friday, Oct. 5. Tickets are available at www.tix55.com/ptc700 or at the box office the day of the performance.

On Thursday, Sept. 27 the newly renovated Steinberg Museum showed of the talents of the visual arts department, but this time it wasn’t the students’ art being critiqued. Situated on the ground floor of the B. Davis Schwartz Library, the artwork of the faculty graced the walls for the Faculty Show 2018.
Winn Rea, who teaches first years in the foundation course, gave an overview of the exhibition. “All the visual arts professors are artists in their own right, and internationally known,” Rea said.
The most enjoyable aspect of this exhibition was that it was not all one form of media; all sorts of art forms are displayed, from rough cardboard sculptures designed by professor Ryan Seslow, to the dainty ceramic stylings of professor Wendy Foster, who is celebrating 31 years at Post. The walls of the gallery were lined with these familiar names, as the depth of the art departments talent became truly apparent.
Any professor in the department was able to submit. “There are a couple of professors who didn’t manage to submit work, but I would say this is a great representation of the department,” Rea said.
Rea discussed her pieces, which are based on her travels and hike across the Adirondacks. “My passion is for the woods, and I spend a lot of time hiking in the Adirondacks, so these works [pictured right] are based on the topographic of the Adirondack Mountains,” she said.
Rea directly translates her passions and own methods into her teaching. “I work with first years, and the fall semester we work in two dimensional forms and the second semester, three dimensional,” Rae said.
Hannah Spegial, 2018 graduate, returned to view her old professor’s work. “I’m glad they are practicing what they preach and this is all fairly recent work,” Spegial said, explaining how the art department had geared her up for her post-graduate life. The exhibition as a whole, even without an overarching theme, still provided the audience with some fluidity. Although not all professors were in attendance, Rea explained her colleagues work and how they inspire not only the students, but each other to become better artists.
“You can see when you go to an art school because we are all working in the same studios, the faculty and the students, we tend to begin to influence each other visually,” Rea said. “It’s almost like a family resemblance within the artistic community.”
The Steinberg museum is open Monday to Friday 9:30-4:30, and students and faculty are encouraged to visit. The next exhibition Dignity: Tribes in Transition, Photographs by Dana Gluckstein, opens Oct 18.

Editor’s Note: The Hot Take is a satirical column that uses humor, irony and exaggeration to point out issues in society, on and off campus. The interviews are fictional, and any resemblance to any real person is coincidental. 
Melanie Boyle’s common hour started with her finding a $25 ticket slapped on the windshield of her Mercedes S450. “This is outrageous,” she exclaimed, pulling out her dad’s checkbook.
A dilemma that most students never face, Boyle grieves. “My parents spent all this money on my $90,000 car now they have to pay for this ticket,” she complained. Boyle was ticketed by public safety for parking in a handicap parking space.
She believes there was a good reason for her actions. “I was in a handicap parking spot so I wouldn’t be late for class. No one uses them anyways,” she said.
Little did she know, her actions had consequences, as George Roberts, a student permitted to use the handicap space, had to park further from his class. “I had to park near Pratt and halfway through I was stranded in the parking lot,” he said.
Roberts, a sophomore physical therapy major, has relied on his parking spot to get to class, but because Boyle had to get her iced tai chi latte with herbal essence and moroccan oil at Starbucks, Roberts missed out on all his classes that day. “I was stuck in the lot all day, it hurts because I’m allergic to asphalt,” he said.
There’s a reason why parking tickets are in place. Actions have consequences and sometimes the needs of others do outweigh needs of the self. A lesson that Boyle has hopefully learned.

Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was first released Oct. 23, 2015. It takes place in Victoria, London during the Industrial Revolution.
In the game, you play as twin assassins, Jacob and Evie Frye, who are in the middle of a different revolution. Jacob and Evie are fighting against the templars who run most of the city and they do so by forming a gang that goes by the “Rooks.”

The gang is made up of both working men and women. This is abnormal because most of the gangs that existed during this age were made up of only men, except for the Forty Elephants Gang. The Forty Elephants Gang were an all-women’s gang that used the women’s lack of social status to their advantage.
At this time, women could not vote, own homes, get a divorce or do anything by themselves, except for one thing: shop. When women went shopping, any male shop owners would leave them alone and not even give them the time of day. This is how the gang made their mark.
With the shop owners leaving the women alone, the gang members stole everything from right under their noses. They weren’t interested in killing, unlike the predominantly male gangs. It was all about gaining property in an era were women really were second class citizens.
The gang members were specifically chosen either for their beauty or brawn. The smaller and more delicate members were the ones handling the shoplifting, while the larger and more intimidating women were ones who made sure the plans went off without a problem.
While it is true in Assassin’s Creed Syndicate assassins are trying to kill the people in charge of the city, the gang is taking over the streets, getting rid of corrupt government officials, crime lords and gaining property. The goal is to gain property, money and other material things that the members have been denied since the templars took over, just like the women in the Forty Elephants Gang.
Although the Forty Elephants Gang was comprised of women, it had a partnership with another gang called the Elephant and Castle Mob. This male gang helped the women move all the stuff they stole. This partnership created one of the first equal-opportunity gang experiences, just like we see in the game.
With all the similarities between having male and female gang members and both gangs’ ultimate goal of making bank, there is little doubt that the “Rooks” is the video game version of the partnership of these two historical gangs.

“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” by English author Douglas Adams is a wholly remarkable book. The first in a trilogy of five books, “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” tells the comedic science-fiction story of Arthur Dent.
Dent’s biggest worry when the book begins is that his house is about to be demolished for a new bypass. By end of the third chapter, the entire Earth is demolished by aliens to make way for a hyperspatial express route. Dent only survives because of his friend Ford Prefect, who Dent learns is from the Betelgeuse star system. (Prefect’s name is a clever joke that most American readers won’t get. It’s the name of a popular British car.)

Prefect was stranded on Earth for 15 years, doing research for a guidebook entitled “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” Dent and Prefect survive the demolition of the Earth by hitchhiking onto a passing spacecraft.
What follows is a hilarious space adventure involving the third-worst poetry in the universe, a stolen spacecraft powered by the galaxy’s first Infinite Improbability Generator, a history lesson containing the answer (but not the question) to life, the universe and so much more.
Along the way, Dent and Prefect meet up with characters like Zaphod Beeblebrox, Prefect’s two-headed, three-armed semi-cousin and ex-Galactic President, Trillian, a female mathematician and astrophysicist who Beeblebrox met at a party he gatecrashed on Earth six months previously, and Marvin, a robot prototype for Sirius Cybernetics Genuine People Personalities technology, who is always in a state of severe depression.
While this story is hilarious and highly entertaining, some of the exposition is so ridiculous that it doesn’t seem to make sense, such as the origins of the Infinite Improbability Generator. Whether the exposition is supposed to not make sense, or it does make sense if you read very, very closely, is uncertain.
Other parts of the exposition are treated as if the reader is not from Earth, and is supposed to have a general idea of what the book is talking about, such as the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal./Sid./Year 03758 that destroyed Prefect’s home planet. While this concept is entertaining, it does leave the reader wondering the details.
“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” ends with a setup to the second book in the series, “The Restaurant at the End of the Universe,” that makes the reader think they absolutely need to buy the next book.

Over the past year since I started this column, I have received a generous amount of compliments on my writing. It seems to be making people happy and that is exactly my goal. A common thing people have been saying to me is, “I love how positive you always are, how do you do it,” and that is where I need to be honest.
I do not believe for a second that it is possible for someone to be positive 24/7, including myself. To try and have a smile on your face or always expect the outcome in life to be positive is quite unrealistic.
There are going to be many times throughout your life when you go through things that make you feel the complete opposite of positive, but I welcome those days. That is how you form the truest version of yourself.
Getting to really know yourself involves real soul searching, which is usually brought on by the conflicts that we face. How you, as an individual, handle those tough conflicts shows a lot about who you are. There is so much chaos in the world, which is why I choose to be happy rather than dwell in it.
When you find something you are passionate about, hold onto it. When you meet someone who makes you feel like the only person in the room, hold onto them. Having these things in your life will help you remember the good when nothing seems right.
Forcing yourself to always be happy will most likely create greater unhappiness within yourself. It is okay to not be okay, everyone goes through it. When you become unhappy, ride it like a wave. Don’t ignore it or bury it within. Acknowledge it, learn from it, and grow.

Athletes at this school can be proud to attend a high-achieving athletics university. Among the Pioneers are some highly trained athletes, and since joint pain can afflict any and everyone, it’s important to have an idea about the things that can trigger pain and inflammation.
Aside from nutrient deficiencies including calcium, magnesium, vitamin D and vitamin K, there are non-nutritional factors that affect the bones and tissues as well. Joint, muscle and bone pain aren’t aliments that only affect the elderly.
Dr. David Borenstein, past president of the American College of Rheumatology and current clinical professor of medicine at George Washington Medical Center, pointed out the fact that grandma is actually correct a majority of the time when she alludes that since her knee is hurting the rain is about to roll in. While studies are varied – since weather systems are extremely erratic and multidimensional – many have pointed out that barometric pressure, which is the amount of air pressure exerted on Earth, has an impact on the amount of pain we endure.
ScienceDirect, an online scientific journal publication, shared a 2011 study on guinea pigs that measured and recorded the amount of pain experienced under low pressure atmospheres, such as what is exerted in the wintertime.
The study was concluded with an overwhelming majority that low pressure and cold environments propagate joint and nerve pain. The reason being is that during these times of low pressure (such as before a rain or snow storm) internal tissue inflammation rises since there’s no warm, moist air exerting force on them. This puts pressure on nerves, leading to pain and discomfort.
Those who have had previous injuries or are sedentary are at a higher risk for enduring this since they often have more baseline inflammation in their joints and tissues. There are a few precautionary measures that can be taken to combat pain.
One simple fix is to dress in warmer layers. This acts as a blanket for tissues and promotes heat and blood flow to vulnerable areas.
Eating a well rounded diet, (no that doesn’t mean doughnuts), filled with foods that fight inflammation can also be beneficial. This means more fruits, vegetables and fish, and less fried foods and saturated fats. Perhaps the most effective and long term fix, however, would be to engage in regular weight bearing exercise.
Increasing muscle tone and bone density is a sure fire way to brace the body for stress, cushion nerves and ensure health.

Editor’s Note: Karis Fuller is the Arts & Entertainment Editor for The Pioneer. 
Seniors Caitlin Johnstone, Tove Sparrman and Karis Fuller are getting ready to dive into their last laps in their college swimming careers.
During her season in 2018, Johnstone, a health science major with a concentration in chemistry from Ashburton, New Zealand, came in first overall in the Metropolitan Championships in the 100-yard breaststroke on February 16, 2018.
Fuller, a sociology and journalism major from London, had a tough season last year after she separated her shoulder. This kept her from achieving her goal to become an NCAA swimmer (a national champion). While injured last year, Fuller was not far off from achieving her goal; in the past two years the London native has been ranked in the top 10’s in the NCAA Division II Championship finals.
Sparrman, an international business major from Upplands Väsby, Sweden placed third in the 200-yard individual medley at the 2018 Metropolitan Championships along with earning a few more accolades that day as well.
Even though the green and gold swimmers have a full year ahead of them, they took some time to reminisce about their time here at Post.
“I’ve had a long journey at Post. I came in as a distance swimmer, took down records freshman year, but it wasn’t until I got injured when I realized what I was good at,” Fuller said.
Johnstone and Sparrman both recalled the moments where they bonded as a team. “I remember close duel meets where everyone is cheering and all the early mornings suffering through practice together,” Johnstone said. “Conference meets are always fun; I like that swimming is more of a team sport here at Post, while at home [Sweden] it’s not,” Sparrman said.
The swim team is up for a new season. They will be hitting the water first at the Sacred Heart tri-meet on Saturday, Oct. 13 at 1 p.m., where they will face Sacred Heart University and Central Connecticut State University. Their first home meet is Saturday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. against East Stroudsburg University.

The chair of LIU’s Board of Trustees made a generous donation to the university to renovate the Hillwood Commons Recital Hall. Renamed the Krasnoff Theater after donors Eric Krasnoff and his wife Sandra, the intimate space has reopened this semester.

The Krasnoffs have been steady long-time contributors to the university, but this is the first time there has been a specific named gift, Krasnoff said. They chose to renovate the lecture hall for many reasons. “It’s an ideal complimentary space to the larger Tilles Center, that’s about 1,800 seats, Hillwood now is just over 500 [seats]. Many of the different types of acts are suitable for that sized space but maybe not for the larger stage,” Krasnoff said, explaining why he chose to fund the renovation of the theater.
“The space was also very old, tired and awkward. It’s going to be a real desirable thing now, for the ambitious expansion of performing arts that the [Tilles Center] director (Bill Biddle) is putting on,” he continued.
Krasnoff has been on LIU’s board of trustees for more than 25 years and chairperson since 2013, and a jazz lover for life. He and his wife selected the opening weekend performances in the renovated theater. On Friday, Sept. 28, the Krasnoff Theater welcomed Jon Batiste, a jazz musician commonly known as the bandleader on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” as the first performance in the space. Helen Sung, a renowned jazz pianist, performed the following night, accompanied by a tap dancer.
“It won’t predominantly be jazz,” Krasnoff assured, although that is what he chose for the opening night. Future performances and events scheduled in the Krasnoff Theater will be decided by the director of the Tilles Center, William Biddle, and from student surveys to bring more acts that would interest students, according to Krasnoff.
The theater is embedded into the university to be of use for students as well. The Tilles Center requires many of the acts that come to perform at Tilles to do workshops open to both Post students and local high school students as well. Krasnoff said the Tilles Center is doing much to bring traction to the space.
“Tilles is doing a better job on social media, advising students of what’s coming up. We offer discounted tickets to virtually everything trying to bring [students] in. The workshops with the artists adds more interest as well – and just getting the quality and bringing acts that are of interest,” he said.
Krasnoff grew up surrounded by the arts and fostered a love for it, which is why he chose to give back. “My parents at a very young age would take me to the ballet and other arts things. You don’t really realize how much you learn when you’re so young and you see all of this. So when I grew up, in college, I realized I do love the arts,” Krasnoff explained. “I was lucky to go to school in New York City at Columbia [University]. Pretty much everything that you are interested in is at your fingertips if you know how to get on the subway and find it.”
Krasnoff is a supporter of the arts. “It’s one of the areas that’s underserved throughout school systems, technically the public school systems, and one that people may not necessarily be exposed to unless it’s made available, it’s nearby and it’s interesting,” Krasnoff said. “I think the arts provide great education to people, the themes that go through arts, whether its dance, drama performances, lectures – which we will have here as well – and performances that provide an insight, a slant on the world in our life that makes people question some of their beliefs, get a deeper understanding of themselves and their role in the world,” he continued.

In the renovated theater, the audience can see that rather than being tiered and steep, there is a steady pitch to the auditorium. The new seating is in a curved arrangement to fit the way the stage has been reconfigured; as a result, the capacity increased from 485 seats to 508 seats. “Very comfortable seats with lumbar support in them,” Krasnoff joked.
In addition to new seats, the updates include a new signature entrance opening to Hillwood Commons; the house lighting was replaced with energy efficient LED lighting; the stage configuration was enlarged and replaced with a spring wood floor (suitable for dancing) and a permanently installed vinyl floor; a line array speaker system (which focuses the sound directly to the seating area) with enclosed subwoofers under the stage to reduce echoes and other acoustic problems; drywall and insulation over the concrete walls to change the appearance of the theatre and improve acoustics; a high definition projection system; and a proscenium arch (stage extension) to transform the look from a lecture hall to a theatre.

“Is there a word for more than up to date? Not outdated, in-dated. Advanced,” Krasnoff said, describing the new technology. Planning for the renovation began in February 2018, according to William Biddle, director of Tilles Center. “We were looking to make the space a first-class event space that could be used for a variety of student and community events,” he said. “We wanted to make sure the theater was comfortable, versatile and accessible.”
Roy Fergus, director of facilities services, said the renovation project began in July 2018 and was completed by September 2018, just in time for the opening show on September 28. The Krasnoff Theater space has been used in the past for student events, such as Convocation, Open Houses and the Best of High School Journalism Awards Day.
Biddle said the theatre will present “many different types of performances ranging from small theatrical and dance performances, to speakers, to emerging contemporary performers in various genres to films.” He is also excited to expand performances by students in the theater. “I am always looking for suggestions and encourage students to give us ideas,” he said.

Everyone has priorities; it is just a matter of how they are arranged. For some, school might come before work and for others work might come before school. But does commuting to campus affect the way you arrange your work schedule outside of school? Do you spend more time in the books or on the work clock or just driving between the two?
Being a waiter for a high class Italian restaurant on the North Shore has taught me how to be flexible when arranging a weekly schedule.

Before I transferred to LIU, my work schedule was completely different than what it is today. Commuting from over an hour away has a significant effect on the hours I am able to work at my job. In high school I was able to work pretty much any hours I wanted after 2 p.m. In college, I must be very careful of the hours I take due to my strenuous school schedule.
An hour commute and 16 credits certainly put your mind in a different state. I’ve realized that my job is just temporary and it’s not something that is going to stick with me for the rest of my life.
The purpose of my job is to pay my bills and to keep my head financially above water. Living at home certainly limits my spending and helps me save money in the long run; I don’t have to worry about things such as groceries and rent, so I am able to work only a few hours a week while saving money at the same time.
The purpose of school runs much deeper than a part-time job. School is where you get the education needed to pursue a lifelong career in a field of your passion.
Small part time jobs do not provide you with the health benefits provided by a long term career and could potentially leave you without medical insurance after the age of 25. As you get older, it is very important to make this transition from your part-time job to your career job for many reasons, including insurance.
After living the life of a young adult, not only have I realized how hard it is to earn a dollar, I finally understand my grandmother when she says, “save your money for a rainy day.” Students who dorm have great opportunities to get jobs on or around campus with the heart of Brookville being a few miles away. Although commuters can apply for on campus jobs, sometimes it is easier to have a job closer to home.
Going from working multiple days a week to only two proved how important an education can be. As far as my education goes, I am content with the balance between my work and school schedules. It seems beneficial for me to be at school MondayFriday and to work on the weekends.
Maintaining a manageable schedule between school and work can be very crucial when planning time to do school work. It’s not a bad thing to dedicate more time to school than work because in the end, the career is by far more important than the part-time job.

Finding a group of people who share the same interests and beliefs on campus might be tough for some students. For those who are searching for a sense of community, members of the campus Catholic Ministry extend their welcome to any and all who may be interested. “We’re here, and you don’t have to be Catholic to come and talk to us,” Felicia Viscusi campus minister, said. 
The Newman club meets weekly to discuss the Bible and God. Viscusi serves as the advisor and leads meetings, and she is open to what members want to talk about. The club meets on Wednesdays from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. “It’s a very open social environment and it gives a different atmosphere than what we’re used to,” Jack Tomlinson, freshman physical education and health major, said.
“It’s a great place to meet other people who are equally interested in Christ, find likeminded Catholics on campus and have a good time,” Cassidy O’Brien, sophomore musical theatre major, said.
“Since being here, I feel a lot more enlightened with God,” Tomlinson said. He attributes much of his positive experience to Father Michael Duffy, the Catholic Chaplain on campus. Through his homilies, Tomlinson said he’s been closer to and open with his faith. Duffy makes his spiritual addresses relatable for college students.
“It’s hard to fully understand the Bible, [but] when it’s compared to us in a similar lifestyle that we live in, it’s very easily understandable,” Tomlinson said.

September 2018 marked Duffy’s third year working on campus to lead or offer mass, hear confessions and assist students and faculty spiritually. He is the pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Malverne, N.Y. “I’m here for you, if there’s anything that I can do for any student, Catholic or not, [I’m] somebody confidential to talk to,” Duffy said.
Viscusi works full-time Sunday through Thursday as the campus minister. She leads the ministry in rosary prayers, Bible study and she initiated a women’s group. She provides a space in Interfaith Center office B for students to come for counseling. Viscusi plans events such as mission trips and prayer groups.
“We are here to help you and let you know that God wants to be a part of your life,” Duffy said.
Members of the Catholic community on campus have been able to bond with one another through fellowship, events and activities. “People in our Newman club and campus ministry [come] from all different majors and backgrounds,” Viscusi said. “But when you’re all rooted in the same commitment and love of Christ, it’s easy to build relationships off of that.”
“It’s been amazing meeting new people and getting connected with our faith,” Neil Feminella, graduate student, said. He enjoyed doing volunteer work with the ministry in 2016 and 2017 to make sandwiches for the homeless and deliver them throughout New York City.
“At any age, it’s very easy to become overwhelmed and stressed and feel alone to say the least, and when you’re with God, you’re never alone,” Tomlinson said. “I think that’s a beautiful feeling to have, to know that there’s always someone there beside you.”
The ministry offers two retreats during the school year for a weekend of “faith, fellowship and fun,” according to Viscusi. From Oct. 19- 21, they will combine with the Catholic ministry at Adelphi University to visit Mt. Alvernia in Centerport, N.Y. where attendees can anticipate opportunities for prayer, mass, adoration, reflection on faith and various activities. The retreats provide a chance for students to meet other Catholics in their peer group. In April, the ministry will travel with ministries from Adelphi University, Hofstra University and Stony Brook University to the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y.
Masses are held in the Interfaith Center chapel every Wednesday and Sunday at 8 p.m. The sacraments of the Catholic Church are observed, including the Eucharist. Food is always served afterwards.
“The best part about mass here is that you truthfully feel as close to God as you possibly can,” Tomlinson said.

A anonymous account was created on Instagram with the goal of informing students of damaged facilities across campus. “Everything_Broken_At_Post,” which now has 242 followers and over 50 posts, documents photographs of broken bathrooms, leaking windows and cracked ceiling tiles among other issues.
The creator of the account, who wished to stay anonymous, said in an interview that the impetus to create the profile came from seeing similar actions taken at other schools. “I was inspired by a friend who owns a similar account, “Everything Broken at UArts,” the account manager said.

Over 30 students have contributed to the account, submitting photos via direct message for the account manager to post. Despite the student contributions, the account manager said they haven’t noticed any changes on campus since beginning the account. They remain hopeful, though, that change will come. “I hope in the future that LIU Post will change, since we, the students, are paying a lot in tuition to go to this school,” the account manager said. “The school, in turn, should do their part and get on these problems right away.”
The account manager encourages students with on-campus concerns to contribute to the account. “If you see something out of place, take a picture or video and send it to me,” they said. “I am a student just like you and wish to make a change within our home we call LIU Post.”
Theresa Kelley, a senior political science major, doesn’t think the account will be successful in fostering changes on campus. “I think there are more effective ways to get things done,” she said. “These concerned students are obviously taking important steps in the right direction, but I would advise them to do what I’ve done in the past and literally go straight to Michael Berthel (Associate Dean of Students), and the head of facilities.”
Roy Fergus, the director of facilities services, recommends that students submit facilities service requests online. “Since it is available to be used by everyone on campus, we strongly recommend using it so that we can correct and/or provide the needed service,” Fergus said.
Students with concerns about broken or damaged facilities on campus can submit a service request form online through a unique webtma.net link for the Post campus, or call facilities services directly at 516-299-2277.
