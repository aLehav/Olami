The 2019-2020 women’s ice hockey team is the first in program history, and it is also the first Division I ice hockey program on Long Island. Head Coach Rob Morgan put together a team he believes will continue to make history. “I recruited every kid and everyone was recruited here for a reason, not just to fill a jersey, but to be a part of something special,” he said. 
The Sharks opened their season with an exhibition match against a professional women’s ice hockey team, the Metropolitan Riveters. The Sharks lost in a 10-3 battle, however they saw it as a great game to prepare them for the regular season. “Getting that first look at the kind of talent, speed, and strength we will be up against this season was an awesome learning experience,” junior captain Morgan Schauer said.
The Sharks officially kicked off regular season play with two games against University of Connecticut. While the Sharks lost in back-to-back days to the UCONN Huskies, the games showed the determination and potential they have in games to come.
In the first game against UCONN, freshman goalie Mia McLeod stood out, making 49 saves on 53 shots. A week later, McLeod made history as the first LIU ice hockey player to win conference recognition, as she was named “Rookie of the Week.” In the second game against UCONN, freshman forward, Carrigan Umpherville scored the first goal of the regular season for the Sharks. 
The early season schedule is made up of some extremely challenging games, including reigning NCAA Division I champions University of Wisconsin. The team played University of Wisconsin on Friday, Oct. 18 and Saturday, Oct. 19. Before the game, Coach Morgan said he expected a tough game, but that nothing is decided beforehand. “I know how good they are and our team knows how good they are. But the outcome is determined after 60 minutes. So, we are gonna go out there and play our hardest and give them a good game,” he said.
The Sharks fought hard but fell in both games with the scores of 2-10 and 0-12. However, the team is taking these games as learning experiences, according to freshman captain, Matilda af Bjur. “Playing against the best is an indescribable feeling. We have a way to go to get there, but it is a journey me and the team are ready to do,” she said.
Junior captain, Morgan Schauer, also had a positive outlook on the loses to the Wisconsin Badgers with the belief that these games are “going to make us stronger and help us to build up our program.”
In addition to play against high ranked teams, one of the biggest challenges the team has faced is the youth across the team. Twenty-one out of their 23 team members are freshmen. “It’s a pack of puppies running around,” Coach Morgan said. 
Without seniors on the team, Morgan said the team lacks the looming sense of a “last ride” among seniors. They don’t have the mindset that this is their last year to win. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it is their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win,” Morgan said. 
Up next for the Sharks is two games against Coach Morgan’s former team, Yale University. The games are being played on Friday, Oct. 25 and Saturday, Oct. 26.

The OneLIU merger between the Post and Brooklyn campuses has brought space for a brand new team on campus: men’s golf. Ben Belfield was selected to be the first head coach of the program. He most recently served as head coach at Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma.  
Belfield was not around when the announcement of the merger was made, or when LIU announced the beginning of the new golf program. He arrived in August 2019, so with little time to fill a whole roster, he made the most of what he could and selected players he felt would be great fit. He decided to focus on younger athletes. “I am looking to recruit fresh-man. I am here for the long term and want to bring in some fresh energy,” Belfield said. 
Belfield believes sophomore Kyle Underwood will be his best player this year and expects him to be a “contender for PoY [Player of the Year] in the NEC.”
In terms of expectations for his players throughout their collegiate athletic careers, Belfield wants “players that love New York and want to be a part of chasing records.” He wants his players to work hard in order to prove that anything is possible, and to “chase results” as his team looks to compete in the NEC. 
The team played its first competition at the Hartford Hawks Invitational and two players, junior Jayden Brown and sophomore Abelardo Yepez, were sent out to represent the team. The two-day event took place from Friday, Sept. 16 to Saturday, Sept. 17. Yepez recorded a three-round total of 235 strokes. This placed him 73rd overall in the tournament, while Brown shot a 238, which put him at 80th in the competition.     
The team played its first competition as team on Sunday, Oct. 6 and Monday, Oct. 7 at the Matthews Auto Collegiate Invitational. The team finished as No.13 out of 17 teams. 
The Sharks  traveled to Grasonville Mary-land for their matchup at the Towson Fall Invitational on Saturday, Oct. 19 and Sunday, Oct. 20 and finished 8th of nine teams.

The art department is hosting the Busi-ness of Art Speaker Series during the fall 2019 semester. The purpose of the series is to em-power art students as they prepare to enter the professional field. The third event in the series was an alumni panel, held at the SAL Gallery in the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library on Wednesday, Oct. 16. Alumni shared their success stories and gave advice to students about making a living as working artists. 
The panel consisted of three alumni: Anna-marie Morgera (‘11), an art educator, Jourdain Jongwon Lee (‘13), founder and director of Space 776 Gallery, and Joshua Taylor Earley, a commercial and narrative director.
The panel was moderated by Winn Rea, professor of art. Rea stressed the importance of finding ways for artists to support themselves in the world today. Back when she was pursuing her degree, doing “art for the sake of art” was enough motivation, but today, artists must branch out to more than one interest in the arts to find a career. 
“We 
artists were a part of the gig economy before there was a gig economy,” 
Rea told students. “We go out and find jobs and create jobs that knit 
together our life, and more and more people in our society will be 
working the way artists have always worked.”
Morgera’s open-mindedness helped her get a job after graduation. She went to catholic school in Queens, where art was not taught. But that didn’t stop her from pursuing her passion for art. It wasn’t until she went to high school where she was given the opportunity to take an art class. After going to the school and showing them a portfolio she made, they placed her in an advanced art class to begin. “I saw that, as I was going through the class with other artists, this is where I belong. I wanted to study art education,” she said.
Morgera knew she wanted to teach in New York City, which is why she was drawn to the art education program on campus. “It was the right place to be – in nature – it’s very inspiring. When I got here I had no idea I would be able to explore so many materials,” she said.
Lee encouraged students to experiment. He told students that, he too, is always learning. This summer he took an appraisal class, and he is also taking the time to build his work on new things, like the online auction platform. “I’m learning all the different things now too,” he told students.
Earley, who studied photography, advised students to explore with different mediums and to create projects outside of the classroom. “If you’re a photo major, check out animation, check out video, because you might not get a job in photography.” Earley’s first creative job after graduation was editing wedding photos. As he moved on in his career towards commercial arts, his knowledge of video and 3-D animation was an asset.
Eric Rodiguds, an art education major who attended the panel, appreciated the advice from the alumni. “I thought it was really interesting,” Rodiguds said.
Storm Keeler, an art therapy major, also enjoyed the panel. “I could connect with them because they were past students. It’s cool to understand and see the process of how people develop.” Keeler said. “It was great to hear different paths of what one can take with their art education at LIU, seeing varying levels of career and success and how you can get there.” 
The Business of Art Speaker Series will continue on Wednesday, Oct. 30 with Jean Noel, Becky Warren, and Charlene Wang discussing online tools for artists at studio A in the sculpture building.

The source of an artists’ inspiration can be anything from major life events to their loved ones. For Shengqi Wan, third year MFA student, her inspiration was man’s best friend. Wan’s dog-themed exhibition showed in the sculpture gallery from Oct. 12-18 with a reception on Wednesday, Oct. 15. Paintings and drawings of canine companions doing human-like activities lined the walls, showing the best of two years worth of work.
“I love dogs, so you see all my works are cute, and they all have their own personality,” Wan said. She owns a poodle named Meng Meng, which means “adorable” in Chinese, and this concept of cuteness played into her artwork as dogs were depicted doing things like eating potato chips and watching TV. “They’re doing human things, just like me,” Wan said.
“The way she presents these dogs is almost very personable. You don’t see it as a dog anymore; you see it as any of your friends,” Seung Lee, professor of art, said. 
Wan also has an international-themed series of dog drawings where elements of different cultures influenced the pieces. A charcoal drawing titled “French Bulldog in Italy” depicts a bulldog wearing a t-shirt featuring the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and holding a plate of pizza. The Italian flag as well as typical fashion and cuisine icons surround the drawing’s subject. “I love their [French bulldogs] funny face, and they give me a lot of inspiration,” Wan said.
All of the drawings in the series were done in charcoal, Wan’s preferred method, because the black color creates a strong contrast on white paper. She can also finish a charcoal drawing fast, compared to working with a graphite pencil. One of her drawings took about half an hour to complete. “For the drawings I finish quickly, but for the paintings, it takes one or two days,” Wan said.
An acrylic painting called “Big White” shows a white dog with a happy expression as it sits in front of a plate of fruit. This one is Wan’s favorite. “I love the smile and the color is really bright,” she said. Most of the dogs are depicted eating food; not only does Wan herself enjoy eating, but she believes it’s something that makes people happy. Desserts like donuts and cake appear often in the series for this reason.
Learning about art history during her time in the MFA program also helped Wan create her pieces. Many aspects of her work were inspired by several famous artists, including French painter Henri Matisse and contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama. 
As one of Wan’s professors, Lee witnessed parts this series evolve over the course of his class. “I had her in MA, and she wasn’t doing this type of work,” he said. “Then she came to MFA, and she clicked onto this dog series, and it’s been growing since.” Wan’s work is more sophisticated now, according to Lee. “It’s not just a cute dog. Even though she started [with] cute dogs, it keeps developing,” he said.  
“I want people to think of their own dogs when they see my work. I want to show the beauty of dogs,” Wan said. Those interested can see more of Wan’s work by following her on Instagram @shengqiwan_art.

On a weekly basis, the SAL gallery provides a space for current students to showcase their artwork. Right on time for homecoming, the work of alumni from the fine arts programs filled the gallery. The show opened on Oct. 14 and will be up until Oct. 25. 
Along the walls of the room and resting on top of pedestals, 52 different pieces of artwork from 51 alumni were displayed. The artwork was of a wide variety, ranging from digital photographs to solar plate etchings to serigraphs and more. 
A reception was held from 5-8 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 16 as a grand opening to the gallery. The crowded room was filled with friends, family, and some of the artists. one being alum Susan Kelly (2017). 
Susan Kelly (‘17) was one of the alumni to display their work. Kelly chose to display a stained glass mosaic piece titled “Suho.” “My work revolves around the portrayal of Korean pop idols. I used stained glass material, so it plays on the preconceived notion of stain glass [representing] holy figures which is what fans of these [K-pop] groups see in their idols,” she said. Kelly explained that she created the piece because she is a huge K-pop fan. “It’s all that I’m into,” she said.
An acrylic painting on canvas titled “Moonlight in Mahogany” belongs to alumna Arielle Dugué (‘16). Her inspiration for the painting derived from a simple Google search. “I saw a tree that was curved backward and to me it looked like figures. So I decided to create a picture depicting that tree with human like figures,” she said. The nature-orientated artwork took her two weeks to complete. According to Dugué, it was difficult for her to choose which piece to bring to the gallery, but she decided it was best for her to bring her most recently completed work.
On top of two pedestals sat giant ceramic busts of famous artists, Beyoncé and Jay Z. These two pieces were designed and created by Emily Halper (‘19). The process took seven months to complete, but five of those months were dedicated strictly to creating Beyoncé. “Women, like Beyoncé, are harder to make because when they wear makeup, their face shape is different. In certain pictures, their face looks way more round versus much more distinct cheekbones. The texture of the hair is different too which affects the shape of the face,” she said.
The next SAL gallery reception will take place on Oct. 30 from 5-8 p.m. for the BFA Photo Thesis show.

Adam Silverstein and Gabrielle Barone were named this year’s Homecoming King and Queen at the 2019 Homecoming game on Saturday, Oct. 19. Students cast their votes over the course of two days from Oct. 14 to Oct. 16. Other candidates included Christina Lynch and Ashley Rodriguez for queen, and Justin Ortega for king.
Silverstein, a senior social work major, hopes he can use his position to create a positive environment for students on campus. “I want to use my status as Homecoming King to continue my goal of being a positive leader and role model,” he said. “Just being that kind of symbol for positivity and community [is] embodying what it means to be a shark.”
Silverstein is currently attempting to create his own organization dedicated to “help[ing] communities and other organizations develop a positive, inclusive, accepting climate where everyone knows that they’re cared about.” His dream is to make that organization internationally recognized and have it operate worldwide.
Silverstein’s advice to students is to “just go for it” and make the most of their college years. “Make sure you are doing everything you want to do, that you take every opportunity that comes to you and make the most of your college career and your life.”
Barone, a senior psychology major, hopes to listen to student opinions about the future of the university. “I would love to do a meeting, or a forum, or even just send out a quiz to see what people are feeling, what they feel needs to be addressed,” she said. “I have that position and I have that voice and what good would it be if I’m not using it to its fullest potential?”
Barone, a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi, also wants to stay involved with Greek Life after graduating. “I’m currently applying to be a traveling educational consultant for my sorority,” she said. “You travel around the country for a year helping different chapters, whether it’s with advising, or if a new chapter is starting up, and helping the organization as a whole.” 
Barone’s advice to underclassmen looking to succeed is to get involved with activities on campus. “Just get involved, [even] if it’s some-thing [as] small as going to a club meeting once a week,” she said. “Just stick your toe in the door, move forward and commit yourself to something because you never know where it will take you.”

LIU students received an email from the university on Tuesday, Oct. 8, asking them to download a new mobile app called LIUSafe. LIU’s Department of Public Safety launched the smartphone program in an effort to strengthen security measures throughout the campus community. 
Students, staff and parents can download the app for free and have real-time, critical information right at their fingertips in times of danger or crisis. Upon opening the app, users can choose from either Post or Brooklyn to access specific safety guidelines and resources created specifically for each campus. 
The app is available to download on both iOs and Android smartphones, making the information easily accessible on any device. 
Most people use their smartphones to get the news and search the internet, and LIU recognized this trend, according to Michael Fevola, the university’s director of public safety. 
“The goal is to help educate as many of our students, staff and faculty as possible and the app adds another layer to that,” he said.
For students and staff alike, the app intends to create a feeling of security no matter time or location on either campus. Trisha, freshman forensics science major Norwood, said she thinks the app is cool. 
“I haven’t heard about schools making apps like that before,” she said. “My parents loved the idea when they heard about it, since safety is a key thing when you live on campus.”
LIUSafe comes with a variety of safety features on emergency situations such as a bomb threat, fire explosion or gas leak, to name a few. But the primary safety concern among many college students and staff, which the app acknowledges extensively, is the possibility of an active shooter on campus. 
“It’s really nerve wracking because it can happen at any second,” Norwood said. 
A school shooting occurred in Norwood’s neighboring county when she was in high school. 
“It’s terrifying to know chances of it are still increasing and nothing is being done about it. It’s always in the back of my mind,” she said. 
The most important safety concern LIU can acknowledge is active shootings, according to Isabella Federico, a freshman early education major. 
“When students come out of high school, they only know what to do in a high school situation if a shooting occurred,” she said. “Living and being on campus is totally different.”
The app provides detailed guidelines for escape routes, hiding spots when evacuation isn’t possible, and best practices for coping with an active shooter situation. It also includes a list of actions to take against the shooter as a last resort. 
Michael Domagala, a junior journalism major, considers the app a necessary tool. 
“Over the past few years, dozens of school shootings have occurred all over America and it’s the unfortunate facts that you’ll never know where the next one will be,” he said.
An extra sense of security, which the app is designed to offer, is what many students have been requesting since campus violence is on the rise. 
“It scares me. Especially since I don’t see many security guards in the buildings that could be high targeted areas like the bigger buildings like Humanities,” said Aislin Peet, a sophomore who majors in musical theatre production and design.
The app addresses almost every emergency a student or staff member may run into. In case of a bomb threat, whether it be by telephone, electronic mail, handwritten or verbal, the app offers step-by-step directions on how to handle each of them. If a student is a victim of or witness to criminal behavior or civil unrest, the app is a click away for instructions on how to keep safe until public safety arrives. 
A subject matter the app fails to address is sexual harassment and violence. Norwood was disappointed to discover that such a timely, crucial issue wasn’t included. 
“It happens to a high percentage of women on college campuses and is one of the key problems I worry about over my safety on campus,” she said. 
Domagala suggested introducing updates to the app, so the school can appropriately advise students and provide tips regarding sexual harassment and violence. 
Sexual assault disproportionately affects college women and impedes their ability to participate fully in campus life, according to the American Association of University Women, the nation’s leading voice promoting equity and education for women and girls since 1881. 
“Many people don’t speak about sexual harassment and violence, and a major part of it is because they don’t know how to,” Federico said. “The issue should be discussed so students can feel comfortable speaking up about it. Including information on the topic would encourage students to speak out, learn how to be safe in situations, and also make students comfortable in trusting the school.” 
All information contained in the app, including recommended protocols and procedures, comes from the United States Department of Homeland Security, according to Fevola.
LIU describes the app as “easy to use” and encourages everyone on campus to download LIUSafe today. “The app, just like our website, can’t help unless people take the time to review and absorb the information,” Fevola said, “Because we never know what type of emergency – severe storm, blackout, fire, etc. – we may face. It’s recommended to review as many as possible.”

Students from across Long Island were inducted into the Long Island HIV Epidemic Campus Advisory Committee. Last week, a total of 24 students from LIU, Adelphi, Hofstra and other universities were named to the committee in a worldwide effort to end the HIV epidemic.
With the help of Anthony Santella, professor at Hofstra University, and his committee, their goal is to assist and advise both the Nassau and Suffolk County Regional Committees in an effort to end the HIV epidemic. Meetings are held across Long Island which students can attend. The university is working with the Post nursing program to introduce a new club on campus to make students aware of the worldwide HIV epidemic. 
Santella has extensive experience involving the subject matter. He’s chairperson of the Nassau-Suffolk Ryan White HIV Planning Council, as well as a public health scientist and health services researcher who specializes in HIV and STI prevention and sexual health. He’s been the associate professor of public health at Hofstra for six years, and stood as the founding director and the assistant professor of the master of public health program at LIU Brooklyn from 2009-2012. 
“For several years I’ve felt that college students have not been engaged in ending the epidemic efforts, so as a college professor, HIV researcher, and advocate, I thought it was time to change that,” Santella said. 
Santella started the HIV advisory committee in 2015 when Governor Andrew Cuomo released a statewide blueprint entitled “Ending the Epidemic.” After the committee’s start in 2015, Santella introduced the three pillars that include the promotion of HIV testing, getting medical care for those suffering from HIV and promoting the HIV prevention pill.
Kayla Halper, a third year nursing major and health care administration minor, is a member of the committee. “This spread of awareness triggers a chain reaction. People infected with the HIV virus are made aware and linked to treatment which suppresses the virus,” she said.
It wasn’t until summer 2019 that the New York State Department of Health approved Santella’s request for a special pilot project to plan and evaluate the Long Island Ending the HIV Epidemic Campus Advisory Committee. “The Goal is to have 750 new HIV infections or less by the end of 2020,” Santella said. “In order to request funding from the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, I had to write a proposal outlining background of why we wanted to start this committee, goals of the committee, expected outcomes, and budget. The proposal was reviewed by state officials, we responded to their queries, and then received an acceptance on August 1.” 
Applications were promoted to 12 colleges and universities on Long Island, according to Santella. The committee met for the first time on Friday, Oct. 11 and will continue to serve through the end of May. 
Santella made progress in spreading awareness among college students who battle the HIV epidemic. He will continue to reach out to students, faculty and staff in the same efforts by conducting community outreach and education regarding “End the Epidemic” on their campuses. 
The U.S. isn’t the only country battling the worldwide HIV epidemic. The “90-90-90 plan” was implemented by the United Nations in 2013 to end HIV, and has three goals to reach by the end of 2020: 90 percent of all people living with HIV will know their current status; 90 percent of all people diagnosed with HIV will receive therapy; and 90 percent of all people receiving therapy will have viral suppression. 
“This globalized movement and plan to end HIV by 2020 is statistically very possible and an honor to be a part of. I hope I can truly help to make a difference in promoting the extermination of HIV,” Halper said.

Kayla Halper! Not Harper! Wonderful job relaying the message!

Some students on campus were experiencing difficulties upon visiting the campus mailroom due to it being short staffed. For the first few weeks of the fall semester, everything from Amazon packages, textbook deliveries and letters from parents were caught up in the sorting process handled by a sole mailroom worker.
As of Thursday, Oct. 10, when The Pioneer initially visited the mailroom to confirm student grievances, it was being single-handedly operated by Sergio Riviera who takes his job as campus mail clerk very seriously. Last year, the mailroom had at least one additional worker on shift to help him out. “Since I’m the only worker here, I’m responsible for sorting the mail, handling packages and speaking with all the students coming to see if anything arrived for them,” Riviera said.
LIU’s mailroom receives about 300 packages a day, according to Riviera, and having just one person to sort them all is difficult. In previous semesters, students expecting packages would find a green card describing their package in their P.O. box. The card alerted them to go to the mailroom window to retrieve their package. Several students made complaints that their packages were not arriving on time as expected since the green cards were no longer put into their boxes. When asked about the green cards, Riviera said it is harder to sort that many package retrievals on his own, so he stopped using the cards.
Anthony Cavarretta, a junior broadcasting major, faced a similar issue. After noticing there was no green card, he went directly to the help window. “It took a bit to find [the package] or if it was there. Sometimes it comes later in the day,” Cavarretta said, though he found being able to go right up to the help window more efficient than searching the mailbox for a card. The only issue now, he said, is the mailroom’s operating hours.
Many students who live on campus don’t own a car to run out and grab what they need, so they rely heavily on mail delivery. “They [students] come during common hour and I’m still sorting everything,” Riviera said. “I need to hurry and get them their mail, so we definitely need at least one more person to help with this.”
Since the introduction of shipping services like Amazon Prime, deliveries are expected to arrive on time. “It’s not that it’s hard to work here but we really do need more people here at least part-time to help for like four to five hours, especially in the morning when all the new mail arrives,” Riviera said. 
As to why the mailroom was understaffed, Riviera wasn’t certain. He believed they just didn’t feel it was necessary to hire additional help. “To be honest, the last couple of years have been alright,” Riviera said, “My boss is really great. He is very understanding, and when I complain to him, he tries to fix whatever it is that’s affecting the work.” 
When The Pioneer returned to the mailroom for a follow up on Thursday, Oct. 17, the mailroom was running smoothly and operating with green cards again due to additional help from a new co-worker. “I think it was the fact that both me and the students were complaining. The students felt things were going a little too slow and if the door is closed they can’t get their mail,” Riviera said. 
Extra hands to assist Riviera is just what the mailroom needed to leave students with a satisfied mailroom transaction. “He comes during common hour and helps with the packages which is great. Sometimes, I have to leave during common hour to do other work so we kind of trade off when I have other work to do,” Riviera said. “He helps me finish the job.”

The Sharks fell with a score of 0-30 against the Saint Francis University Red Flash on Saturday, Oct. 19 in their first homecoming game as a Division I program. It was a hard hit for the team, who had a rough start to the season.
“It’s always disappointing with a loss and it gets even [more] magnified when it’s homecoming and you have support from the administration, the student body and the alumni,” Head Coach Bryan Collins said after the game. “You always want to put a good show on and you want to show that you are progressing, so we are a little bit disappointed with our result today.”
Coming into the game with 0-5 record, the Sharks hoped to take their first win of the season. The first half was a defensive battle. After a 16-yard rush by Saint Francis Univeristy’s Derrick Wiley, the Red Flash would take the first score of the game on a 26-yard field goal by Trevor Thompson, making the score 0-3 in favor of the Red Flash with nine minutes left in the first quarter. 
The Sharks looked to answer immediately. A 30-yard pass from junior quarterback Clay Beathard to senior Tim Marinan put the Sharks in a position to score, but redshirt freshman Briant DeFelice’s 31-yard field goal attempt was blocked, holding the score 0-3.  
 With two minutes left of the second quarter, the Red Flash found the end zone for an 11-yard touchdown, extending the Saint Francis University’s lead to 0-9 which would be the last score of the half. “I thought we were very competitive in the first half, we missed a couple of opportunities offensively, but I thought de-fensively we played really well,” Coach Collins said. “Then I think we just got worn down in the second half by a team that’s maybe a little bit deeper than we are right now.” 
Coming out of halftime the Sharks tried to create offensive play, but were only able to get one drive throughout the third quarter. The Red Flash took command, but did not manage to score.
On the first play of the fourth quarter, the Red Flash scored a touchdown and earned the extra point on the following kick, extending the Red Flash lead to 16-0 with 14:55 left to play. 
After forcing the Sharks to repeatedly punt the ball away, the Red Flash would score two more touchdowns together with approved kicks, making the score 0-30 before the final whistle. 
Redshirt junior nursing major Jerome Brooks felt disappointed after the loss and said the team didn’t have their head in the game. “We just start to lose mental focus at the end. We do silly mental errors that we shouldn’t be making,” he said. 
However, Brooks said the team also had positive sequences that they will take with them going forward. “A lot of the freshmen stepped up today and played well. People made some big plays,” he said. Coach Collins shared Brooks opinion saying, “we had some young players that played a good game today and I think certainly the future is bright.”
Coach Collins said it may sound weird to say that the future is bright when their record is 0-6, but that this year is about letting young players develop. “We have very young players that are playing some valuable minutes and they are going to gain experience,” he said.
Collins also pointed out the importance of not getting torn down by the losses. “A loss is horrible, but you just can’t treat it as such,” he said. “We have to build upon it and use it as lessons learned and motivation and progression.” 
As a coach, he said it’s important to keep a positive attitude towards the players to keep them motivated and focused even if things don’t go as planned. “What you need to do is a building process, not a tearing down process,” he said. 
Going forward, the Sharks will continue to look for their first win of the season on Saturday, Oct. 26 against Central Connecticut State University. Brooks is hopeful that the team will be able to reload. “I’m pretty confident in us that we will get it right next week. We will practice hard tomorrow and throughout the week, clean up our mental mistakes and then just get back into it,” Coach Collins said.

After missing the initially intended fall 2019 start to the program, the university received approval from the American Veterinary Medical Association’s Council on Education to begin accepting applications for the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM). The program is now set to begin in the fall 2020 semester, and has an expected enrollment of 100 students. 
In an email to the LIU community, President Kimberly Cline announced that the university received the letter of reasonable assurance from the council, as well as delivered updates following the university’s 2015 strategic plan, “LIU 2020: Education Beyond Boundaries.” She wrote, “Earning designation as one of 32 veterinarian schools in the country is a tremendous accomplishment, made possible by many campus leaders, but especially through the team led by Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs, Dr. Randy Burd, Dean Carmen Fuentealba, an international leader in the veterinarian field, and a group of extraordinarily talented veterinary faculty.”
LIU will join Cornell University, Tufts University and the University of Pennsylvania in offering a veterinary medicine school in the northeast region. There are a total of 32 veterinary medicine schools across the nation. 
Dean Fuentealba said there are numerous, equally important steps the university must follow to implement a program that will meet and exceed the 11 accreditation standards of the American Veterinary Medicine Association Council on Education. “Our first step was to join the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC),” she said. The university will also need academic facilities to house new students and to carry out student clinical requirements.
While plans for an extension of Pell Hall to accommodate the new classrooms for the vet school were considered this past spring, the university has also purchased land from the Commack School District to house animals in the student clinic. The Board of Education signed a 10-year lease of the Marion Carll Property to LIU. The lease covers 6.5 acres of the 9-acre property, including a dilapidated barn and dangerous overgrowth, according to a statement from the school district. Per the agreement, LIU has promised to tend to the property and improve and maintain its condition. The property will also be open in the coming years for students in the district to take educational field trips. 
The lease was given to LIU after the Marion Carll Property Committee considered two other proposals during a meeting on May 8. LIU scored a perfect rubric in the ratings of each proposal and the committee unanimously voted in favor of recommending the CVM proposal to the Board of Education.
On Monday, Sept. 16, the Commack Community Association met with Dr. Carmen Fuentealba, dean of the veterinary medicine school, to discuss the university’s intentions with the leased property. According to the minutes of the meeting, which was held at the Commack Public Library, the veterinary school is “required to have a place for students to learn to do live exams on chickens, cows, goats and horses. These animals are categorized as ‘Food and Fiber’ animals. The college would keep a small herd of 10 dry cows, 10 goats and some chickens for 10 students at a time to practice medical exams on the animals. The livestock for the college must be purchased from USDA approved vendors.” 
When it comes to fulfilling the required 100 student enrollment, Dean Fuentealba is not worried. “We are confident that we will have no difficulties recruiting excellent students,” she said. The CVM will join the Veterinary Medical College Application Service which is administered by the AAVMC. According to the site’s latest report, 8,152 individuals applied through VMCAS in the 2018-2019 cycle.
Dean Fuentealba is prepared to take on the quickly approaching start of CVM, and is excited for “educating the next generation of practice-ready and entrepreneurial veterinarians.”
