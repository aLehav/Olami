Kudos to Kahlil Haywood’s article in the Pioneer issue dated January 26, 2011! I really like the points that he made. Really good advice that was very helpful to some situations I’m dealing with now. Go Kahlil! 🙂

Okay, I think we’ve had enough snow already.  Seriously I’m done.  The thick, chunky socks and massive Hunter boots have to go.  Between the snow and the food poisoning (oops, I mean virus), I’m starting to feel relieved this will be my last semester at Post, even though I will sincerely miss all the friends and professors I’ve met along the way (you know who you are).  I guess every week that goes by feels more and more nostalgic for me. When I was a freshman I never thought I’d be where I am, managing a college newspaper, finally writing my senior thesis which I have dreaded since the day I learned what a thesis was, finding a beyond excellent boyfriend, trying fiercely to type up my resume for whoever decides to employ me next year, and as of right now avoiding snow and ice damage to my 2008 Nissan Sentra.  Why aren’t they plowing the resident parking lots!? Don’t worry we will have a story on that for you next week.
As for now, Dunkin Donuts or Java City? Which do you prefer? One reporter has the scoop on what taste the student body is gravitating to this semester.  And now that its competition Starbucks is on its way by summer, what will happen to Dunkin?  Read on to find out.  Another reporter covered the follow up to this health scare.  Was it the food?  Our News Editor also covered the popular but expensive winter trip to Costa Rica with our Provost.  The rest as they say is history…no literally, someone covered a Martin Luther King dinner this week.
Our now-becoming-famous relationship columnist is back and has decided to do a weekly column instead of bi-weekly due to all our great feedback.

The lady Pioneers got to feel the pain of losing in the final seconds along with joy of walking away with a solid win all in the span of three days. First, the lady Pioneers battled Saint Thomas Aquinas College at the Pratt Center on Thursday, January 27th after the game was pushed back a day due to the inclement weather. STAC led for the majority of the game until the lady Pioneers caught up. The game was then shot for shot, with both teams going up and down the court.
With 19 seconds remaining in the game, the Pioneers regained the ball down by one. Holding for the last shot, senior guard Janea Aikens took the final jumper as time expired. Luck was not on the Pioneer’s side, as the ball didn’t make it into the hoop. Aikens lead the team with 17 points while senior Alyssa Lombardi had a team high 12 rebounds in the loss. Briana Sloper led the way for Saint Thomas of Aquinas in the 52-51 victory with 17 points and 5 rebounds.
On Saturday, January 29th, the Lady Pioneers looked to shake off the tough loss from earlier in the week when they headed to Queens College to take on the Knights.  The Pioneers fell behind early, trailing by 8, but by the end of the first half, regained the lead 40-36.
In the second half C.W. Post pulled away, building a lead and never letting it slip away. Junior guard Felicia Joyner had a season high 25 points in the 76-67 victory.  Aikens and Anthia Smith chipped in 13 points while Lombardi had 6 points and led the team with 11 rebounds.  With the victory, the lady Pioneers improved their overall record to 9-9 overall and 7-6 in the East Coast Conference.
The lady Pioneers will begin a three game road trip this week when they take on the University of Bridgeport on Wednesday, February 2nd for a 5pm tipoff, and then travel to Mercy College on Saturday, February 5th for a 1pm start. Both games can be heard on 88.1 FM and WCWPSports.org

This past week, C.W. Post women’s swimming came up short in their meet with the Bridgeport Purple Knights. Though the loss dropped the team’s overall record to 3-7 the meet was not a total loss for the Pioneers. The team gained some momentum in this close loss with five individual victories coming from some of the youngest members of the squad. The Pioneers’ “A” relay team started off the meet with a victory against Bridgeport’s “A” team. Senior Riley Cassidy, sophomores Cornelia Hanes and Mairi Morrison, and freshman Tamara Garriock teamed up to win the 400 Medley relay with a time of 4:31.60.
Individually, Hanes came away with a victory, narrowly winning her individual 50 Free with a time of 27.30. Beating her opponent by .05 seconds. In the 100 Butterfly, Cassidy took first place with a completion time of 1:06.60. In the next event, Morrison took first in the 100 Free with a time of 1:00.87. Finally, Garriock came away with three straight victories for the Pioneers, winning the 100 Back with a time of 1:08.54.
There was nothing that these girls needed to hang their heads about. Even though the team failed to walk away with the victory, there is much to look forward to at their next meet and beyond, especially from the Pioneer’s younger swimmers. The team’s next meet will be the East Stroudsburg Invitational next Sunday at 12 p.m., the team’s last regular season meet.

After two straight years of championships, the pressure is on for C.W. Post men’s lacrosse team.  Currently ranked first in the nation by both Lacrosse Magazine and Face-Off Magazine in their annual preseason polls, the team began preparations in January for a repeat victory in the Division II field.
Practicing through cold weather, snow, and anything else Mother Nature has to offer, the Pioneers are hoping to three-peat in 2011.  In addition to a second national championship in 2010, the Pioneers also walked away with a program-best 16-1 record, leading the division in winning percentage.  “We were very happy with the team last year,” said Coach John Jez.  “To win back-to-back national titles was a great accomplishment.”  Although senior leadership played a key factor in last year’s success he pointed out, a young group of offensive players also steadily matured last season, improving their play and providing Post with added depth for the upcoming 2011 season.
This season, the Pioneers will have to wait until well after the midway point in their season to face the most serious competition in their schedule; third-ranked Mercyhurst on April 9th.  The team will face only one team ranked in the top five nationally in regular season play.  Post will have to concentrate much of their effort on maintaining their own level of play against teams that may be no real match for the defending champions.  In the meantime, the team is focusing on filling in the gaps left by the departure of several key players in 2010.  “We need to play with more energy and at a faster pace,” Jez said.  “We have to be more consistent in the goal and possess the ball more.”  According to Jez, the team is working hard this preseason and staying focused, leaving him with only positive feelings about 2011.  “There is very little room for error in NCAA Division II lacrosse.  One bad game and you can be on the outside looking in,” he said.  As Division II men’s lacrosse only consists of 34 teams, he pointed out, “you must be perfect.”
Perfection is what the team will be aiming for later this month when they travel to Phoenix, Arizona to face Notre Dame de Namur University, Grand Canyon University, and Mesa State College in their early season trip, beginning February 17th.

The C.W. Post men’s basketball team has been on an absolute tear within the last month of play. Their last loss came December 30th against Southern New Hampshire University. Since the beginning of the New Year however, the Pioneers have won 10 games in a row and have outscored their opponents by an average of over 15 points per game. The Pioneers (14-6) have played exceptional basketball as they concluded the month of January (10-0) and are currently in first place in the East Coast Conference.
C.W. Post’s most recent victory came on the road against Queens College (12-5) on January 29th. This contest was a tight, back-and-forth battle as the two sides were tied at the half 32-32. However, the Pioneers hit their stride as the second half began. C.W. Post got off to a quick start and took the lead by as much as 12 points in the second half.
The Knights had no answer for the Pioneers ECC Player of the Week, junior guard Stefan Bonneau. Bonneau has been almost impossible to guard during the last month. The Knights defense became yet another victim in Bonneau’s torrid scoring. Bonneau dropped 28 points on 9-19 shooting from the field, and nailed five three pointers to lead the Pioneers in scoring. He has now scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games.
The Pioneers had a balanced scoring attack, as sophomore guards Jonathan Kohler and Tobin Carberry both chipped in on the offensive end. Kohler put up 11 points and Carberry scored nine points to help lead the Pioneers to a 79-70 win.
After inclement weather pushed back C.W. Post’s match up with St. Thomas Aquinas (4-14) from Wednesday to Thursday, the Pioneers had no problem cruising to yet another win. Bonneau and Co. dominated the Spartans 79-65, as the Pioneers stayed undefeated in their home court.
This game was an all-around good win for Post as four players scored in double figures. No one player dominated the ball, and the offense flowed nicely as a result. Tobin Carberry led the scoring for Post with 18 points on an impressive 8-11 shooting from the field. Bonneau and Kohler each had 16 points apiece. Kohler also added team-high nine rebounds. Senior forward Aaron Hall rounded out the scoring with 14 points for the Pioneers as they shot 53 % for the game.
The Pioneers’ next game is away against the University of Bridgeport (10-7) on Wednesday, February 2nd. The Purple Knights are presently in second place in East Coast Conference standings, behind the Pioneers. The last time these two rivals met was back on January 10th, when Post came out victorious with an 82-78 win at home. In this game, the Pioneers will look to make it eleven consecutive wins and pad their ECC lead in the standings.

What is beauty? My friends and I often find ourselves talking about all types of women, and, sometimes, I’m taken aback by how many types of people we can be attracted to. The ways people perceive beauty are so different. My friends and I have endless debates about what we like and whom we find attractive. More times than not, we don’t agree on the same ladies. We all have our own preferences. What may look gorgeous to someone else may not look as good to me, and vice versa.
 
This got me wondering: What constitutes ugliness in a person? For instance, I may love thick thighs and big hips, but that same type of body may not work for everyone. Many times, one may find nice bodies and not so nice faces. This is a question that none of us have answers to, but it’s definitely something to think about.
 
Sometimes, you can’t help but think that some people are universally unattractive. Jean Morantus, a senior here at Post says, “Everyone has a preference, but most would agree a ‘Flavor Flav’ would be ugly.” It’s hard to pinpoint, I suppose.
 
A big nose on one person may look good on him or her and just not as good on someone else. Joanne Ligonde, a sophomore student, says, “A lot of attraction can come simply from how someone carries them self.” Matthew Waters, a senior as well, also chimed in and said that, “A person’s aura has a lot to do with how much I’m attracted to them.”
 
It’s arguable that beauty may not have much to do with the physical appearance. Other things do accompany beauty, such as how someone speaks or socializes. I once had someone tell me that they put looks second and were attracted to someone because they had a good reading voice. It’s all relative.  You will often find that people with bad attitudes or people who are simply unpleasant with how they behave. Those same people may be, by physical standards, some of the most beautiful people, but they have hideous insides. This is one debate that is seemingly endless.
 
Beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder. You watch shows like Maury, and you sometimes see odd couples and wonder, “How did they end up together?” You may see a 30-year-old man with a woman who is 75. Sometimes, you may even see a very tall person, who is in love with a midget. Surely, in these situations, the attraction is beyond physical, but a lot of it still is. The reasons for all these weird pair-ups baffle all of us. But, we may confuse others with the people we are attracted to as well. I suppose that attraction, more than anything, may be more linked to emotion.
 
Emotions are sometimes the only things that we can link to decisions we make. Many times, emotions defy logic, which is why the aforementioned situation always seems to boggle us. There really is no concrete answer to what beauty is, but I would say, simply put, it’s being comfortable in your own skin… truly comfortable.

The goal of going to college is to be prepared for the real world of jobs and to learn about the fields students are going into. College also helps a student to grow into an adult and to choose the future that he or she wants for himself or herself. But does our college, C.W. Post, prepare us for these things? After we graduate, will we feel comfortable enough to submit our resumes into the hands of employers? Students feel the pressures of school and thinking about the future, but some feel that more can be done to prepare us.
Alumni and January 2011 graduate Elena DiMarco thinks Post prepared her for the real world and is happy to have gotten her education here. “As a journalism major, I definitely feel that Post prepared me for the outside world,” says DiMarco. “I had great teachers who pushed me to do my best work and made lifelong friends who continue to support and encourage me in all that I do.” DiMarco found her way into the workforce after graduating. “I have a part time job that is perfect for my current living and financial situation, and I wouldn’t have gotten it if I didn’t have the education and tools I received at Post.”
Alumni Wilbert Adams, who graduated in 1993 from Post with a Bachelors in Criminal Justice, reminisces about his time at Post. “It was a long time ago,” says Adams, “but I definitely liked the atmosphere at Post, and I still come to visit the school all the time.” He jokes that he never went into criminal justice after school and instead did public relations. “I bartend and serve right now. It’s not the school’s fault. It’s just what I wanted to do,” he says.
Recent Alumni Nick Parker, who graduated in May 2010, had nothing but nice things to say about Post. “I’ve learned, like John Mayer says, ‘there’s no such thing as the real world. It’s just life.’ Do I feel Post prepared me for life after college? Yes, and for one clear reason: You get out of it what you put in. I loved my broadcasting classes, and most of all, I found another home at WCWP, where I worked everyday of my college life, and now, I’m an On-Air Personality for Z100 New York and WALK 97.5, it’s a dream!”
Full-time student Dyana Buttacavoli, a public relations major, thinks Post could do more to prepare us for the job world. “I don’t think Post prepares us at all,” says Buttacavoli. “I’m terrified to start an internship/job in pubic relations because, after three and a half years of studying the field, I still feel like I don’t know anything about the major.”
Director of Graduate and Alumni Services Jason Cascone shares what the Career Development Office at Post does. “It’s a fairly new office with a new format. The new format will tell how we’re doing, since we’ve only been doing this for about a year now. We haven’t had enough students go through the process to get enough feedback. We would like to hope that they are [prepared]. It’s something the student has to look for on their own,” he explains. He goes on to  say that it used to be the advisors that kept the students on track, but now, with the new format, it’s the students’ responsibilities to start their resumes and to figure out what they want to do with their degrees. The new format is a more “holistic” type of counseling.
The future starts here, but it doesn’t end here. Your professors and academic counselors can help point you in the right direction of your career path. C.W. Post now offers a course called Experience Enriched Education or EEE. The program meets once a week for four weeks and gets juniors and seniors acquainted with how to write a resume and what to do when going for a job interview. In this course, students are asked to sign up on a website called Jobnet.com, which helps a student individually find a job or internship in his or her field of study. Signing up has a fee, but the opportunities that could come are priceless. The idea of finding a job independently is a good thing; it teaches a person how to really be in the outside world. People won’t be walking with you hand  in hand for your whole life; after high school, people are on their own. There is only so much that administrators can do for tehe good 10,000 students that are enrolled in the school. The only person you can depend on is yourself. The more you push forward, the farther you will get.

With the recent stomach virus that plagued the C.W. Post campus last week, many students began to wonder if it was this “virus” they were being told of, or if it was something more.
Questions arose with the spread of this virus and its involvement to dining experiences at Post. Could have anything to do with the numerous students who were admitted to the hospital? It was said to have been a large coincidence for students to get sick barely 48 hours after majority of the dorming students settled back in.
“Dining Services always works closely the Nassau County Department of Health and follows stringent guidelines for food safety,” said Director of Dining Services, Shawn Carvajal. “Since the illness is believed to be a Norwalk-like virus, which can be spread more readily through human contact, we took the precaution of wrapping fruits with their peal on.”
If you dorm, then you know there aren’t many options on campus to eat. You can go to Hillwood and possibly catch the Little Shop of Commons open or settle for a Subway sandwich. Then there’s Winnick, the more popular of the eateries to grab a quick dinner and maybe some dessert. Then there is the infamous college student dilemma of ordering in or going out to eat. However, that can become a costly expense in a college student’s budget.
Being that Winnick does see the most foot traffic for dorming students, it should be a priority to please them and meet their nutritional needs. “Students always complain after eating at Winnick,” said sophomore Sociology major Samantha Osgood, “I think food poisoning is completely believable!” Osgood was adamant about her feelings. “For the amount of money we pay to attend school and for room and board we deserve much better food in terms of quality,” she said.
Winnick stays on top of keeping the facility clean doing such tasks as manicuring the salad bar when it becomes messy and having clean dishes ready at the needs of hungry students. However, the dining atmosphere has a lot to do with the experience and not just the cleanliness of the cafeteria style-dining hall. Marissa Santomaso, a junior Public Relations major exclaimed, “Although since the ‘outbreak’ Winnick has been trying to step up their game, the service is almost embarrassing.” Marissa also added, “the workers are rude and at time too forward with the students and aside from a select few staff members, it’s impossible to get a smile or cordial ‘you’re welcome’.”
When options are limited, it’s hard to be picky about one of the main dining halls. However, there are changes that you can make to help better the experience. The main one is the suggestion box. If you have a comment or a concern, it is your right and responsibility to voice your opinion so that the director of Aramark (the food service) knows what needs to be done to please their customers.

Imagine this: as you’re laying in bed sleeping, a pager suddenly clicks to life, a dispatcher’s voice comes over and relays information to you.  It’s the middle of the night and someone in your community needs your help.  Without thinking you get up and respond. Going to provide aid to whomever might need it.  When you clear from the call, you don’t get to go back to bed, it’s time to begin getting ready and go to classes for the day.  If you’re a student who also volunteers, this is a scenario that can become all too familiar.
For Angela Redmond, a Junior Psychology major at C.W. Post, this has been a situation she’s faced repeatedly, even before attending college.  “I’ve always wanted to help people,” Redmond said. “When I was 13 I began volunteering at Wantagh-Levittown Ambulance Corps and then also joined the Levittown Fire Department when I turned 18.”  Apart from attending Post as a part time student and volunteering for the Levittown community, Redmond also works full time with autistic children where she helps to teach them how to perform daily life skills.  She added that her training as an Emergency Medical Technician has helped her while working in this field, “Some of the kids have seizure disorders and because of my training I know how to care for them and make sure that they don’t further injure themselves.”
Derek Skuzenski, a Senior Criminal Justice major also volunteers for his local community along with attending classes.  A member of the Roslyn Fire Department, Skuzenski does it all, “I’m a firefighter, EMT, and EMS Lieutenant.”  While attending school full time and completing an internship with the Nassau County Probation Office, Derek is also expected to maintain a 20% average to remain a member of his volunteer department.  “I have to make 20% of calls, trainings, drills and fire school,” explained Skuzenski.  Derek has also taken the training provided to him by his volunteer agency and used it to help him professionally, working as an EMT for the C.W. Post campus.  Becoming certified as a New York State EMT is a certification that takes about 6 months of classes and is provided at no cost to members of volunteer agencies all throughout the state.
While Redmond and Skuzenski agree that the most difficult part about being both a student and a volunteer is finding a way to balance it all, they also agree that the sacrifice is worth it in the end.  To students wondering if they too could find the time to volunteer for their communities, Redmond added that, “There will always be rough times between school, work and other obligations, but never quit at what you want to do, when you overcome those obstacles you will feel that much better about yourself.”

This past Friday, the Pratt Recreation Center was bustling with students. From 10:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m., C.W. Post residents, commuters, and their guests flooded the gym with one thing on their mind: Pratt After Dark. Who would not want to partake in a night full of free food, hot tunes, and lots of prizes?
This year Pratt After Dark took on a ‘Casino Night’ theme, and was put together by Student Life and Leadership Development, Residence life and Pratt Recreational service. The Multipurpose Room was decked out like a real casino with four table games including craps, roulette, poker, and blackjack. Not to mention the entire table of slot machines. Students started out with 500 chips to do with what they pleased. When they had enough, or lost everything, they would ‘cash-out’ their chips, and the number would be recorded. At the end of the night, the four students with the most chips won a prize. The first prize was the winner’s choice of an iPod nano or a GPS. Second prize was what ever the first place winner did not choose. Third place was 30 dining dollars, and fourth place was 15 dining dollars. For those who were not into gambling, down the hall was a massage room and tarot card reading.
Food was available to students free of charge. At the concession stand, they offered nachos, pretzels, ice cream sandwiches, and an assortment of drinks. There was also a smoothie stand to enjoy. If students were still hungry, they could enter one of the many eating contests. “I love the eating contests,” said Junior Theatre major Mike Greco. “Especially because my team won the taco bell challenge.” The challenge consisted of several teams of three. Each team competed to be the first to scruff down 12 soft tacos. The team that won received Visa gift cards.
Inside the gym, there were carnival games, a photo booth, license plate maker, and tons of blow-up obstacle courses. In the middle of the gym was a huge inflatable rock wall. ”I thought the blow-up stuff was pretty cool,” said Senior English major Riley Cassidy, “I was too afraid to try the rock wall but now that it’s all over I really wish I did. I also liked playing the carnival games because I won a lot of candy and chocolate.” Rows of table games such as air hockey, ping-pong, pool, and even some basketball hoops lined the gym for those who just wanted to relax with friends.
While this years Pratt After Dark is over, students are already looking forward to next years. “Pratt After Dark is definitely one of the events I look forward to every year,” said Junior Political Science major Dan Caccavale. “ I can’t wait until the next one!”

It’s bright and early and class is about to be in session. Students who have just woken up swarm the Hillwood Café and Java City for their early morning coffee fix before they head out for a long day of classes. For the workers at these on campus refreshment vendors, the hour before class means heavy business.
This fall, the Hillwood Café has acquired the popular Dunkin’ Donuts brand coffee. But what does acquiring the Dunkin’ Donuts brand coffee mean for Hillwood Café’s neighbor Java City? According to Java City employer Lora, their business has declined by 60% since Hillwood Café started offering Dunkin Donuts coffee. “We still get out ‘faithful customers,’” Lora says with a sigh. “Maybe the [Dunkin Donuts] coffee is cheaper or Dunkin’ Donuts is better for them”.
In a survey, 6 out of 10 students preferred the Dunkin Donuts brand at Hillwood Café as opposed to the coffee offered at Java City. “Java City [coffee] is too watery. Dunkin’ Donuts just tastes better,” says first year Graduate student, Veena Ganesh. Others have argued that getting the Dunkin Donuts brand is cheaper and quicker. “It’s good. You just make it yourself and go,” Junior Nicole Cileo states.
While some students prefer the Dunkin’ Donuts brand, others are more partial to Java City’s coffee. “There are more options and more to chose from, and you can actually taste the coffee. Dunkin’ Donuts is too bland” argues Senior Joey Vollers. Sophomore Danielle Cirrone argues the validity of the Dunkin Donuts coffee. “The Dunkin’ Donuts coffee [at Hillwood Café] isn’t real Dunkin’ Donuts coffee”.
To some students, it’s not just about the taste of the coffee, but the service that is provided. Freshman Jen Baxter, a Java City go-er, mentions an employee by the name of Ursula. “She makes me feel like I’m her daughter”, says Baxter of the Java City employee. “She’s fabulous and always smiles”.
Although Java City employee Lora was upset by the decline in business, she still remains hopeful. “You may go to the Café to get Dunkin’ Donuts coffee in the morning to wake you, but when mid-day comes, you gotta come to Java City for that Javalanche sugar rush!” she said with enthusiasm. “We’re the only place on campus that can do that”.
No matter where you get your coffee, whether it is Hillwood Café or Java City, the choice is up to you. Either way, we all need to stay up for class somehow!

The School of Visual and Performing Arts will be offering a two-year master’s degree program in video game design and development beginning in the fall of 2011.
“This master’s degree program brings to the C.W. Post Campus the serious study of games as a technological, artistic, educational and social form of media,” said Benjamin Moore, Acting Dean of the School of Visual and Performing Arts. “In just over a decade, digital games have emerged as one of the most popular forms of entertainment and are also being used as an invaluable tool in education, science, medicine, the military and government.”
Former SVPA Dean Jon Fraser originally conceived of the idea a few years ago. It then further developed by former Dean Rhoda Grauer, who continued the process by bringing in consultants from that field.  Furthermore, students have been requesting a program like this one for some time. “We have been getting requests for a gaming program for a few years, even from undergraduates,” said Barbara Fowles, Chairperson of the Media Arts Department. “It’s not clear how the current economy will alter people’s interest in this type of program. But we hope it will encourage more people to try something different!”
The new game design and development program consists of game programming, game design, 2-D and 3-D animation, and the actual creation of games.  This adds a new dimension to the programs that the School of Visual and Performing Arts already has.             The department is hiring new instructors for the program, as well as having faculty from different departments contribute to the program. These include Professor Carlomusto, Professor Levin and Professor Betka from the Media Arts Department, Professor Pat Aievoli from the IMA program (Art Department), and Professor Christopher Malinowski from the Computer Science Department.  Each of these professors will play a role within the game design and development program. Fowles mentioned, “I hope to play a small part in the program as well.”
For the game design and development program, applicants are required to have bachelor’s degrees somewhat related to the program, such as computer science, digital arts or media, or even creative writing or psychology.  Personal experiences within these fields are helpful.
The new master’s degree program offers an opportunity to students to work in a workshop type of structure and have a one on one, and hand on experience. “They will learn to work in a team, since that is how things are done in the actual industry,” said Fowles. “We are aiming to place graduates in companies that create small games, such as for the iphone, educational games, or other beneficial games.”

The Division of Student Affairs sponsored a Martin Luther King Jr. Remembrance Dinner on January 24th at 5:30 p.m. in the Tilles Atrium. The program included performances by the Cultural Greek Council and SNAPS. A crowd of 75 people was in attendance. The central room in the Tilles Center was decorated with posters and images of events that were of cultural importance during the 1960s. One poster of “WDAN-TV channel 24 on air show” depicted a broadcasting company that was available over the air in 1959. The Tilles Atrium also had jazz music in a candlelight environment. Mr. William Clyde Jr., director of HEOP/MLK/EAP, welcomed the attendees to the 9th Annual Martin Luther King Jr. Remembrance Dinner.
Shortly after his introduction, Provost Paul Forestell, made brief opening remarks by sharing the impact that King’s teachings have made in his life. After Forestell’s personal testimonies about how King’s legacy has affected his as well as other many lives, Clyde emphasized the ability to grow and be appreciative of the fact that many lessons were learned. “It is in this ability to hear people’s pain,” said Clyde. “That the strength to never fall into the trap of compromise will develop.” Students from the Cultural Greek Council then marched into the Tilles Atrium while holding up signs that read “we march for jobs for all now,” “we demand equal rights now,” “we demand voting rights now,” and “no U.S. dough to help Jim Crow grow” among others. As his introduction neared completion, Clyde went on to ask this thought- provoking question, “What would be the legacy of C.W. Post?” He concluded with some words of wisdon including “we walk hand in hand in peace.”
Afterwards, a presentation of King’s famous speech on the 100th anniversary of Emancipation Proclamation was displayed on a screen. King’s speech was an essential part of the civil rights movement that put an end to segregation in order to promote racial harmony. “We cannot walk alone,” says King. “We need to make plans to march ahead.”              At the end of his speech King made the following statements: “I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.”
“King changed black people’s lives in the United States,” commented Jeff Huang, Finance major. Another student, Brandon Fennell, Criminal Justice major, expressed that “King broke racial boundaries.”
Clyde then introduced Father Ted Brown, Director of Religious Life, in an invocation. Afterwards, Clyde invited the audience to a dinner heavily influenced by southern cuisine. The southern meal consisted Catfish, Collard Greens, Mac & cheese, Cornbread, Chicken, Louisiana rice, and Sweet potatoes. After the formal meal in honor of King’s legacy, Clyde introduced Arielle Thomas for a poetry reading. Thomas recited two selections of poetry; an original and another by Lynette Adams entitled “Remember the Times.”
Following her poetry reading, Clyde took the opportunity to thank the committee members, including Martin Guillet of Recreational Sports, Lynne Schwartz of Student Health Counseling, and Eric Zirlinger of Student Life & Leadership Development, and Jared Ciborowski, the SGA President. Shortly after Annie Jules took center stage in a musical selection entitled “Imagine” and received a loud applause. Clyde brought the festivities to an end with closing remarks.

Imagine spending Winter break basking in the sun, interacting with ocean life, and having the experience of a lifetime, all while earning three credits. This past winter session a group of students embarked on a journey to Costa Rica to study dolphins.
The trip took place from January 1, 2011 through the 17, and included a variety of students ranging in year, and with majors such as Psychology, Marketing, and English. The students studied in a small fishing village called Manzanillo on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. The village is in the Gandoca Wildlife refuge, and is a protected rainforest area.
The course is a three-credit Psychology or Honors elective, and is lead by C.W. Post Provost, Dr. Forestell. Students studied the social interactions between two species of dolphins – the bottlenose and the tucuxi. The students went out on the water in a powerboat to conduct observations of dolphin movement patterns and social behaviors. “The dolphins behavior was something I didn’t expect at all,” said International student Elina Viitasaari, a sophomore Psychology and Criminal Justice major. “They came so close to the boat, they were whistling, jumping or just swimming around us, it was so unbelievable.”
The students spent free time on the beach, and getting to know one another. “Once we had a chance to go to ‘Jaguar Wildlife Rescue Center’ to see different snakes, frogs, birds and we were even able to hold the baby monkeys,” said Viitasaari. “We went zip-lining! It was lots of fun! One of the best things was the jungle hiking. It was totally beautiful.”
In all, the trip ran for 17 days. It has taken place every year since 1998. The course began at Southampton College, and moved to Post in 2006. “The trip was started by me when I was a faculty member at Southampton College in the Interdisciplinary Psychobiology program,” said Forestell. “I still lead the trip, but each year a student who previously participated in the trip is invited back as a field assistant. This is a long-term study of unique dolphin behaviors that has already lead to two master’s theses, a number of conference presentations, and a peer-reviewed publication.” This years assistant was Laura Thompson, a Southampton college graduate. Laura participated in the trip in 2003, and then served as a field assistant in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Laura just finished her Master’s degree in Biology at Hofstra, and did her research and thesis on the project.
According to Viitasaari, the students did not only learn about dolphins, they also caught a glimpse of life in another part of the world. “Costa Rica’s slogan is ‘Pura Vida,’ which means ‘pure life’,” says Viitasaari. “That attitude was totally noticed in locals’ life style. People concentrated more on true values of life instead of material goods. Nature and environment were respected. It was admirable. Here it’s hard to think that slogan, the life style is too busy in New York and life is too stressful.”

When you were younger, do you remember being told to eat your green peas and carrots at the dinner table? You probably couldn’t eat these foods because you thought they tasted “icky”. As you got older, you realized mom and dad were probably right; these foods were healthy and yummy.
Most people can readily agree that if you eat right, you will look and feel your best. A nutritious and healthy diet is crucial for the regular maintenance of your body. If you are someone who makes healthy choices when it comes to your body and health, then you should join the Nutrition Club.
The Nutrition Club aims toward spreading awareness to the community about nutrition and good health. At this club, students discuss community service opportunities, social ideas, and fundraisers that have to do with nutrition. The Nutrition Club is open to all students on the campus, although it is mainly made up of nutrition majors. Many people enjoy joining this club because students find ways to enhance resumes when it’s time to apply for dietetic internships. It is also a great way to network with other people.
Currently, the Nutrition Club is working with RockCANRoll, a non-profit organization that sends donated food to pantries, soup kitchens and shelters. They are working with this organization as a way to collect food donations at events held at the Tilles Center. After donations are collected, they are sent to local food pantries across Long Island. An important event that many people are looking forward to is National Nutritional Month, which is held in March. This year’s theme is “Eat Right With Color.”
Laura Binder, president of the Nutrition Club, explained that the club hopes to educate its peers in the dining area to incorporate food of various colors into their diets.
The Nutrition Club holds meetings every other Tuesday during common hour (12:30 to 2 p.m.) in the food lab, located next to room 338 in Pell Hall. Students are encouraged to join and make a difference.
The Nutrition Club instills in students that it’s never too late to start living a healthy lifestyle because our bodies keep regenerating. This club allows students to get a unique experience and gives them the chance to make  positive changes that others would want to follow.

Are you tired of commuting to the C.W. Post Campus? Maybe the idea of driving back and forth or being unable to dorm makes you frustrated. Stop wasting your time roaming Hillwood Commons trying to decide if you should get another coffee or sandwich, and join the Commuter Student Association.
CSA is a very popular organization that is truly about providing commuter students the opportunity to voice their concerns, form long-lasting friendships, and enrich their college experiences.  It is also a place to go and a time to have something to do. This organization meets every Monday during Common Hour (12:30-2 p.m.) in the Pioneer Room, located in Hillwood Commons. These meetings are short and get right to the point, specifically so commuter students can obtain campus information and learn about upcoming CSA meetings. On alternating Mondays, CSA will hold “Movie Mondays” with PTV, where students can relax and watch movies with their peers. Although last Monday was only the first meeting of the semester, commuter students are hoping to make this time meaningful and fun. Students who are interested in attending upcoming events or in learning more can contact cwpostcsa@gmail.com
On Monday, January 31, CSA hosted its first Movie Monday with the funny film, Easy A. Not only did commuter students get a few laughs out of this movie, but CSA supplied pizza and beverages as well. Pizza, a cold soda, and good friends…I don’t think it can get any better than that.
Kathleen Christman is the current president of the Commuter Student Association. Christman said, “I understand being a commuter student makes it very difficult to make friends because you either have to go home or attend a prior obligation.”  Commuting can be difficult because you may not be able to attend all events taking place on campus, which makes you feel as if you are not getting the full college experience.
CSA’s goal is to create programs, so commuter students can make friends and simply have a great time. Some events include sporting events, casino nights, and Bingo for Books. CSA also holds community service projects, such as Peanut Butter and Jelly Time and both local and out-of-state trips to Ronald McDonald Houses.  Events that commuter students can participate in on campus are homecoming, Post Pride Day, and Pratt After Dark.
“CSA urges students to voice their concerns,” according to Christman. Commuters definitely succeeded in this, as lockers were installed in Hillwood this year. This makes carrying and dragging large books and bags a lot easier. Students are also advised to attend Town Hall meetings, sponsored by SGA, as a way to talk to the administration. Additionally, students have the luxury of using the Commuter Student Lounge in Hillwood Commons. Although this is open to everyone on the campus, it makes it a convenient place for commuters to relax, have a bite to eat, or enjoy quality time with friends.
Although some students don’t like the idea of waking up earlier to get to class or hitting traffic, commuter student and Italian education major Amanda Randazzo feels commuting doesn’t have to be that bad. Randazzo says, “I enjoy commuting. I am still able to get involved on campus, even though I live at home. I am a student ambassador, and I might decide to dorm one day.” Randazzo plans to join CSA, having heard positive feedback about this organization.
The Commuter Student Association takes pride in making students feel right at home. This organization will allow students to explore their surroundings and give them a feeling of home.
