San Bernardino, C.A., was the epicenter of America’s latest mass shooting. According to San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department, the shooting occurred at the Inland Regional Center, a center that provides services to people with developmental disabilities. Marybeth Feild, president and CEO of the center, said “…the incident took place in a conference area that an outside agency was renting.”
Also, Wednesday’s gathering was one of two “general education” meetings that the department holds each year. The purpose of the meeting was to provide employees the recognition they had earned throughout the year’s work before the holidays. However, according to media reports (both FOX News and MSNBC) the gathering dubbed this meeting a “Company Christmas Party.”
According to San Bernardino’s Sheriff’s Department, “14 have been pronounced dead, and 21 are wounded but expected to survive their injuries.” The suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, are Los Angeles natives, who according to law enforcement, “worked in collusion with each other to execute the premeditated mass murder.”
Now, the FBI is investigating the case have yet to label the incident as terrorism or, for that matter, ISIS-related. However, democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, deemed the incident “not normal” and “intolerable.” She’s right; but in wake of the attacks in Paris, with unrest in the Middle East, and ISIS undoubtedly on the rise, many Americans have been quick to cry terrorism, and America as a whole is growing restless with radical Islam.
Given the circumstances of living in the Post 9/11, it’s become ever more strenuous to monitor and manage enemies of the state such as ISIS. ISIS hasn’t been the only thing on the minds of Americans as of late. Issues such as racism, police brutality, the ever-growing issue of income inequality, and climate change have become the talking points. Oh, and did I mention we are less than a year away from election?
Don’t ask for me for a solution to these problems, for I have none. All I can do is voice the opinion of my generation, and especially, Post Students. The Pioneer asked students what they thought about America’s recent issues, both foreign and domestic.
“I’m worried,” said Livy Booker, a freshman communications major. “It’s scary when you turn on the news, and we live in New York, so you know we are a target. I’ll be honest I’ve been on edge as of late.”
Booker isn’t alone, when asked the same question, Michael Santos, a junior political science major voiced a similar sentiment. “It’s [shootings] everywhere. It’s in schools, cities, suburbs, hospitals, planes. Everyone’s a target now, and our enemy, or whatever you want to call them, [are] faceless. You just don’t know,” Santos said, as he anxiously tied his shoes and made his way to class.
Will anything change? I honestly do not know. However, based off my observations, the confidence of Americans, for whichever reason, seems to be wavering. The confidence Americans once sported so proudly, is seemingly giving way to insecurity. Is it because our borders are under siege? Is our dollar not stretching as far as it once did? Or terror threats both foreign and domestic? Is it all the above?
Well, whatever the problem is, Americans are searching for answers to those questions. Perhaps, they will be answered on Election Day.

The holiday season brings tons of food, family time, holiday cheer and, of course, holiday shopping. Before Thanksgiving is even over, before the turkey has been taken off the table, people are rushing out to get the best deals on Black Friday.
This year, many stores and shopping malls opened early on Thanksgiving Day. The Broadway Mall in Hicksville, N.Y., opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and stayed open until midnight. The mall then reopened at 6 a.m. on Friday morning, Nov. 27.
Tiye Bradley, a freshman dance major, works at Victoria’s Secret at the Broadway Mall. “The customers weren’t really disorderly but the store was very busy all night [on Thanksgiving],” Bradley said.
Natasha Vaughn, a senior adolescent Spanish education major, accompanied her brother on a quick shopping trip on Thanksgiving night. “We just went for a television purchase, but the madness in those 20 minutes was enough for me,” Vaughn said. Even though Vaughn and her brother were only out for a short while, they saw some interesting occurrences. “I saw people scrambling to get their hands on the last of the 4,ooo televisions that were on sale, whatever that means,” she said.
Even after Black Friday, shoppers are still out and about preparing for holiday gift giving. Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, N.Y. like other malls in the area, extends its hours during the holiday season. Starting on Dec. 2, the mall will be open until 10 p.m. on weeknights and until 11 p.m. on Saturdays. From Dec. 11 to Dec. 25 the mall is open until 11 p.m. every night. Many stores have special deals around the holidays; Brighton, for example, gives shoppers a free tote bag with any other purchase until Dec. 13. Journeys shoes also is offering up to 50% off on selected items until Dec. 11, as an extended Black Friday deal.
Despite the crowds and rush for deals, a touch of holiday spirit infused the Black Friday shopping experience, holiday shopping brings people together in an odd way. It reminds us of how close the holidays are and gets us in the spirit.

Professor Molly Tambor’s interest in 20th century European history, especially on topics of women and gender, has led to an amazing discovery: the existence of women- only police forces.
Her initial research focused on the suffragist movement in Italy following World War II, when the women there began earning new rights for themselves. But while doing her research, Tambor said she found accounts of these newly-liberated women entering law enforcement, and began to explore their experiences as a new class of police officers trying to make it in a field predominately made up of men.
Tambor conducted her research at the Central State archives in Rome where the government stores its records. Tambor discovered something else among her findings: she found that the national director of the police force had reports submitted to him stating the possibility of allowing women to join the force. “I found that women who were protestors and activists were trying to get into the police force, so I started to follow the trail of paperwork,” she said.
Many male police officers were reluctant to have women join since they didn’t think women could stomach the crimes. “Women actually spent most of their time handling terrible crimes, including sex offenders, sex trafficking and prostitution,” Tambor said. “They ended up dealing with what seemed not appropriate for women.”
Tambor came across some interesting facts while doing her research as well. “Prostitution is technically legal in Italy, and when women are arrested they are charged with ‘disturbing the peace’. But when male prostitutes who are usually transgender are arrested, they are charged with ‘identity fraud’ because their identification papers say they’re male and pretending to be female.”
Tambor intends to write a book, or as historians call it a ‘monograph’, which is a detailed written study on a topic that might turn into a documentary. She said she found all these bizarre stories about women, the kind of policing they did, the obstacles they faced, the crimes they were involved in, and how society went crazy at the thought of police officers wearing skirts.
“I feel like my story is turning out to be not just about how law enforcement is different for men and women, but how the law is different for men and women too,” she said.

A childhood of “Dungeons and Dragons” and time abroad in London as an undergrad were the contributing factors that led Jay Diehl to pursue a career in understanding the texts and manuscripts that came out of monastic life during the 11th and 12th centuries.
Diehl, who is an assistant Professor of History at Post, said his research is “an attempt to write a social history of learning and writing in monasteries.”
“My research really has to do with manuscript books in monastic communities,” Diehl said. He explained that this time period experienced a “spike” in book production. “It was kind of the first revolution in literacy in European history. In the region I study, from all the centuries beforehand, there’s about 80 books. Then starting in the 11th century, we have like 600 books.”
This great divide fascinated Diehl. “I’m interested in understanding what role this increased presence of the written word was playing in monastic culture,” he said. “And to try to figure this out I look at the books and the texts they contain, and because this is a manuscript culture – everything is handwritten – you can customize the text to a certain extent.” Diehl explained these customizations involve changing the formal characteristics of handwritten texts; such characteristics include annotations, drawings, layout structure and titles.
Diehl explained that these manuscripts could help determine which bodies of knowledge certain monasteries were focusing on, and how those studies factored into daily monastic life.
Diehl went on to talk about his experiences both inside and outside of the classroom that have helped his independent research.
“In my religion course I did show one of these manuscripts that I’m working with that contains a church law collection, and certain canons in it have little notes. And so I ask [my students] to theorize what these notes might’ve said about how this book was being used.”
Diehl spends a large part of every summer travelling to libraries in Europe and playing with manuscripts, mentioning that his visits to one particular monastery inspired the prospect of a book. “I’m working on it right now,” he explained. “It’s about the history of books in the Saint Lawrence monastery in Belgium.”
His parting words revealed that his line of work is not easy. “Book history is its own thing. To be a medievalist who works with manuscripts, you need to learn how to read Latin, you need to learn how to read the hand-writing that’s used. You need to learn how to date them. There’s all these skills, and the only way to really get good at it is just to do it over and over again.”

Two years ago, the award-winning documentary “Blackfish” premeired (July 19, 2013). Since the release, SeaWorld’s stock has had a dramatic fall. Now, SeaWorld is reinventing itself with a new plan of increasing the size of their pools, and supposedly ending their orca shows in one of their theme parks.
“Blackfish,” a documentary following the captivity of orcas, also known as killer whales, shows the danger of captivating wildlife for both humans and whales. The documentary revealed SeaWorld’s treatment of orcas as to how they use callous practices at their marine-based theme parks. The documentary examined the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau that died at SeaWorld, and interviews with former trainers described how unethically the orcas were treated. The story revolves around Tilikum, a captive killer whale that has taken the lives of several people.
“I felt bad initially as I have been to a show at SeaWorld as a kid, and enjoyed it,” said Rebecca Goch, a senior English major, after watching the documentary. “Now as an adult I was awakened to the tragic reality of animals held in captivity. I would never visit SeaWorld again.”
The effect of the documentary regarding SeaWorld’s revenue the last two years since the release of Blackfish is a dramatic stock decline. Its stock has dropped about 35 percent since it went public in 2013, according to CNN Money.
According to Blackfishmovie.com, in two years, SeaWorld has reported an 84 percent total drop in profits, as figures included a huge drop in attendance rates.
When SeaWorld’s stock started to decline, they first began by fighting back, stating that PETA has been spreading lies about their treatment of wildlife. SeaWorld announced a new project two days after its stock dropped more than 30 percent. SeaWorld’s latest approach is taking numerous steps to boost its image by new ads that feature SeaWorld employees conveying the care that animals receive at its parks.
No matter how they try to reinvent themselves or manipulate their practices, SeaWorld’s latest earnings show that they are losing the public relations battle. As SeaWorld’s revenue has declined, news about them reinventing themselves has spread. However, the change has only been announced for its San Diego Park, leaving with no planned changes at the other two parks in Florida and Texas, according to Blackfishmovie. com.
The latest changes for SeaWorld are that in Sept. 2015, it launched a $100 million plan to increase the size of its whale habitat. The plan has been approved by the California Coastal Commission. SeaWorlds new tank is 350 feet long and 50 feet at its deepest point, according to TakePart.com.
However, in their article, facts regarding the usual habit of orcas are not meet saying, how orcas in the wild swim over 100 miles per day, equivalent to 1,500 laps a day in the new tank. Another aspect is that orcas dive up to 1,000 feet below the ocean’s surface. In their new tank, that would be impossible as it is only 15 feet deeper than the current tank at a maximum of 50 feet
deep. The new plan came with new additions, as SeaWorld has had many lawsuits against them, because of their treatment of wildlife and deaths at their parks. According to CNN Money, a condition for the new plan to be approved was that SeaWorld cannot breed the orcas it currently has in captivity in the state of California. SeaWorld has guaranteed that they will fight the ban.
When I heard about SeaWorld’s plans of expanding their pools, I couldn’t help but think that it’s like kidnapping someone and after a while providing them with a longer chain; it’s not going to do anything but to ease the guilt of the offender. Greed has won over ethics many times before, however, in the case of SeaWorld, they can’t invite ethics into a company built on greed, and to falsely advertise themselves as a company now caring for wildlife would be hypocrisy. The truth of the matter is—they are “reinventing” themselves to avoid bankruptcy, smell the greed yet?
Wildlife is meant to live in the wild—hint: the name. They’re not called pool-life creatures for a reason; they don’t belong in a pool. As little as Orcas deserve to be put in a pool, does SeaWorld deserve a second chance because their new plan is preposterous. No bigger pools or cancellation of shows can ever set the orcas free.
The orcas don’t belong to SeaWorld, they were stolen from the ocean and their freedom was taken away. On SeaWorld’s website, they state that they have rescued over 26,000 animals, and helped them give a second chance. So my question is, why don’t they give the wildlife they have captivated a second chance?

When we venture off to the movie theater, most of the time, if not all, we see movies for the ‘entertainment’ value. However, do we ever take a moment to think if what is on screen in front of us, could actually exist somewhere in real life?
Take Christopher Nolan’s film, “Inception” for example. The plot-basis for “Inception” involves the story of a man named Cobb, who, in essence, learns how to ‘tap’ into his mind and the minds of others and diffuse his and their ‘dreams’ from reality (almost acting as a parallel universe, in which he attempts to prevent things that could potentially be dangerous to them in real life).
Now, that may have sounded like a whole lot of jargon, so let’s cut to the chase. Recent discoveries by scientists are now allowing them to begin to ‘see’ what you’re dreaming about as you sleep, all of this in the form of shapes and colors thus far. Creepy? Yes, but real.
An article by LJ Vanier, “Scientists Can Now Record And Show You Your Dreams,” (Oct. 18) shed light on the new and eerie experiments. “This innovative device utilizes existing technologies like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and supercomputers to make a video of what a person is thinking about through computational models,” he said, highlighting the technology that scientists are using to make this a ‘reality.’
Diving deeper into the process itself, the article states that a study conducted at Brown University in 2011 incorporated three people who wore EEG devices as they slept. When they woke, they were asked what they were dreaming about, and then the brain device “cataloged all of the brain images and stored them.” Afterwards, the scientists repeated this an estimated two-hundred times, and they were able to show the people multiple images stemming from their dreams.
Philosophy professor Dr. Arthur S. Lothstein believes that these ‘experiments’ altogether, are more than what meets the eye. “The technological project in question seems little more than scientific hubris, and a possible cash cow for the technologists in question,” he said. “I’m not
a Luddite, who disbelieves in science or technology, but the project in question though, raise more questions than it answers, and seems to me to be but one of many poorly thought through scientific projects, hiding- behind the protective coloration of the attractiveness of the subject.”
On the other side of the coin, Richard Renelique, a senior broadcast major, thinks this is a discovery that will be beneficial to the public. “I think it is a great advancement because it can lead us to better interpret the human mind and possible discover things we do not know about the human process of thought or emotion,” Renelique said.
Agreeing with Renelique’s notion is junior transfer undeclared major, Robert Williams. “I think it’s good that science is learning more about the human brain and how it works,” he said. “For scientists to be able to ‘see’ what you are dreaming can be very beneficial for certain types of patients but the technology has to be used for the greater population and not to manipulate it.”
That leaves the very intriguing question: would students ever partake in an experiment like this, and why?
“If I was given the opportunity, I definitely would,” Williams said. “I have always been interested in dreams and what they mean but I normally have had trouble remembering them when I wake up. With this type of technology I would know exactly what I dreamt, giving me a clearer picture into what happens when I fall asleep.”
Renelique agrees. “I would do this the first chance I got,” he said. “I think it is an integral part of the human experience to understand one’s self, and what better way to do that than to see what your mind tries to hide from you? I may end up being scared or even bothered by what I find, but this is sort of like a metanoia or spiritual journey. In the end, I’ll be better for it.”
I have to agree with Renelique and Williams. I would honestly love to test this out, because all my life thus far I have been intrigued with the concept of dreams and just everything that goes along or is transpired from that concept.
Even though it stems from a different branch, when I first saw “Inception” by Christopher Nolan, it instantly became my favorite movie and I was mesmerized by its plot and how, in essence, the entire movie was an internal battle. Aside from that, I connect to dreams in a personal way and have always felt that the vivid feeling one gets from a dream is remarkable, and how close it can feel to real life.

Finals week has been scheduled unusually late this semester, and students have come to realize that this year, they might have to juggle cramming in ways to attain Christmas spirit between long study sessions because the last final exams are on Dec. 22. So, in between writing papers, students might have to write their wish lists. Some students have already started and know what’s on their wish list.
“My mom asks me to make a list every year so she has some ideas of what to buy,” said Melissa Grossi, an early childhood education senior. “The one thing I really wish to get on my list this year is a new purse, I’ve set my eyes on a Michael Kors bag.”
“On my list are new dress clothes like ties and a suit. I am starting student teaching next year and will soon need it for work,” said Justin Boba, a childhood education senior.
Miranda Higgins, an senior English major, doesn’t have a wish list but is excited for exchanging gifts. “I never write a list, as I don’t care for what the actual material possession is,” she said. “It’s the thought that counts, plus, this way it’s more of a surprise.”
Some students don’t wish for material items, instead their wishes seem to be things that money can’t buy. “My biggest wish is to have a job by the beginning of 2016, so I can quit my part time job when I graduate in the spring,” said Megan Draghi, a senior childhood education major.
One student has already gotten a head start from her wish list. “I got a new computer just now, because mine broke,” said Christina Kotarski, a senior English education major. “Since I need it for school, I got it in advance. So this year, Christmas came early.”
According to Brostick.com, the best selling technology gift product of 2015 has been the Fitbit, a charge wireless wristband, and they estimate that it will he one of the best selling tech products that will be on people’s wish lists. The Fitbit monitors your sleep patterns, and tracks you workouts, heart rate, distance, calories burned, floors climbed, active minutes, and steps taken.
If you haven’t made a list yet, you better get to it. As we all know, if you don’t have a list, Santa might assume that you’ve been bad this academic year.

Local band Stray Shadows will be playing two shows as part of Gorilla Music’s Jingle Bell Rock Festival. The band, which includes junior film major Mike Themistocleos on guitar and vocals, is to appear on the evening of Friday, Dec. 19 at The Nail in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, followed by a show on Sunday, Dec. 20 , at Revolution Bar and Music Hall in Amityville, N.Y.
“We play indie garage rock kind of like the early 2000’s Strokes and Arctic Monkeys era when [that genre] was coming back,” said Themistocleos. The band has been playing together for a year and a half but have only been playing shows for a few months. Other members include Joe Oliveto on guitar and Dan DeLucia on bass, both of them contributing backing vocals.
According to Themistocleos, the band has recorded demos but are waiting to record full tracks until they acquire a permanent drummer, who they are actively seeking. “I would like to take [the band] as far as possible,” continued Themistocleos. “Of course, it’s just fun playing shows and writing music. This summer I want to see if we can get together a two week tour or something.”
Stray Shadows found its origins when Themistocleos’ punk band in high school stopped playing together. “A good friend of mine who I used to swim with picked up the guitar and used to always say we should start a band one day,” he explained. That band eventually became a reality, at first playing covers of favorite bands, but quickly writing original material.
Themistocleous is the primary lyricist for the band. “I’m a very anxious person, so anxiety works into the writing,” he said of his lyrical topics. “Women, too. The same stuff you tend to see. Either striking out with women or just in general.” Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys is a key influence to the Stray Shadows lead man, as well as David Bowie. Originally a poetry writer, Themistocleous also find interest in the poems of Libertines singer Pete Doherty.
Being a student of film at LIU Post, Themistocleous has informed his music writing with that perspective. “I can be writing something on guitar and think that it would work perfect in a film,” he explained. “One of our songs we mention Alvie Singer, the main character of ‘Annie Hall’.
There’s always those name drops and references to scenes in our songs. I think in a way [film and music] are separate but you can listen to a song and in the second verse think about how it may tie in to a scene from ‘Lost in Translation’ for example.”
Stray Shadows and ticketing information can be found at their Facebook page, facebook.com/strayshadowsband. Themistocleous stressed the importance of supporting local bands, and why someone should attend a concert for band like his. “The most important reason [to come to these events] is that it’s good to support local bands. We’re definitely not as great as we can be yet, we’ve only played a few shows, but we’ve run into some great support. It would be very fun, it’s a holiday show so we have quote unquote holiday surprises, and there will be other bands there as well. A fun day out.”

Last week, LIU Post’s photo department held a photography exhibition named “(un)still”. The exhibition took place in the Sculpture Building from Dec. 1- 5, with a reception on the Dec. 2. It presented 14 artists, where each of them exhibited two of their photos. Photography Professor Allison Rufrano explained that the exhibition was part of the Photo 7 “Photography Workshop” class. “The main part of the class is that it’s an exhibition class,” said Rufrano. “So students are working on this body of work so they each leave with a portfolio with their own concept in vision but at the same time they are putting together group shows.”
The theme behind this show was movement. Rufrano claims that the theme was something the class picked as a while the first day of class after brainstorming different ideas. “We had groups of like five of us and we all came up with words and from the words we picked ones that we liked,” said Jessica Peace, a senior photography major. “So for our group we did movement so then we all picked movement as a class and then we picked the title after that.”
Once the theme was selected, the students had a process of taking photos every week that related to the theme of movement. “Each artist approaches that theme with their own concept, their own style, their own vision,” said Rufrano. Peace was also very satisfied with the theme since she believes it was a good theme where everybody could just do their own thing, “You have such a variety that you can do with the concept of unstill,” she said.
Peace, a boy’s soccer coach in her free time, decided to photograph the boys in her team. “My interpretation of movement was that their minds are always going like crazy all the time,” she said. “So when it comes to sports, it’s harder to make them pay attention and get what they are doing, so I [captured what] they are during games and all that stuff.”
Student Jacqueline Scaccia, who is also a senior photography major, also worked with athletes but decided to go for more of the still part of the unstill theme. “I did athletes standing still like posing for a picture,” said Scaccia. “But I also wanted to show like the same emotion that they have on the field so I did that in the studio in Pell.”
The exhibition showed a great variety in the pieces even though they all had the same theme. “It all depends on how the artist decides to take the theme, that’s why they each also wrote a statement underneath to tell the viewer a little bit of where they were coming from,” said Rufrano. “There is one student who is dealing with nature and her photographs are very sharp; they don’t deal with motion at all it’s all about the unstillness of nature and that kind of thing.”
Scaccia really enjoyed seeing all of her classmate’s work and believes that the show was very successful. “There were a lot of people that came out and it all looks good,” she said. “I like that there is a lot of variety like everybody’s interpretations are different so its nice to see how everyone comes up with it.”
“That’s the good thing about the concept of unstillness, it’s open ended, it’s open for interpretation,” said Rufrano. “Even having the ‘un’ in parenthesis leaves it a little more open for the artist to really approach whatever they want.”
But the class didn’t only focus on the pictures, Rufrano claimed that big part of the class was learning not only how to put together an exhibition but how to work in groups. “There was a reception committee, a hanging committee and graphic design committee, leaving the students completely in charge of getting the show ready,” she said.
Rufrano believes that the exhibition was fabulous and had a great turnout that allowed people to take a look at the work of very talented photographers. The exhibition was for sure filled with amazing work, each one with their own unique take on what (un)still might mean to the artist or the viewers themselves.

The television show “The Flash” premiered in October of 2014 and is a spin-off of fellow CW show “Arrow,” starring the Green Arrow. The show follows the adventures of superhero Barry Allen, a.k.a. the Flash, and is based on the DC Comics character. In “The Flash,” Barry and Team Flash work at S.T.A.R. Labs in Central City and attempt to capture various meta-humans who threaten the city. Meta-humans are people who were given superpowers after an explosion in S.T.A.R. Labs, which affected Barry, Team Flash member Cisco Ramon, and countless others. Some of Barry’s powers include super speed, time travel, and super agility.
“Legends of Today,” is the eighth episode of “The Flash’s” second season and functions as part one of a crossover with “Arrow.” It expands on several characters for the newest CW spin-off of “The Flash” and “Arrow,” “Legends of Tomorrow,” which will premiere on Jan. 21, 2016.
In the eighth episode of “The Flash,” which aired on Dec. 1, Barry and Cisco are tasked with protecting Hawkgirl from Vandal Savage, who has journeyed to Central City to find and kill her. With an unstoppable immortal searching for Hawkgirl, Barry turns to the only people who can help him, Oliver Queen a.k.a. the Green Arrow and his team in Star City.
After joining with Team Arrow, our heroes meet Hawkman, who is also trying to protect Hawkgirl as he attempts to free her to unlock her powers and the memories from her past lives. While half of the episode was focused on Hawkgirl, the other half involved other members of Team Flash, including Dr. Caitlin Snow, Dr. Harrison Wells, Joe West, and Jay Garrick. The four had to come together to save Dr. Wells after he was accidentally shot by a police officer.
Since “Legends of Today” will be the first episode in the two-episode crossover between “The Flash” and “Arrow,” it will have big shoes to fill after the high bar of the first crossover last year. Not only was this one of the best episodes of “The Flash,” it also topped last year’s crossover. Once again the high point of this crossover is the interaction between the different characters. It’s always fun to see actors and characters from two different shows on screen at the same time. All of the actors have great chemistry, with Stephen Amell and Grant Gustin as Oliver and Barry and Carlos Valdes and Emily Bett Rickards as Cisco and Felicity as the standouts.
While the fight scenes in “Legends of Today” were fun, the smaller character moments really stood out. One of the best moments is when the heroes are in Team Arrow’s base of operations where Cisco makes fun of Thea Queen’s alter ego and tells her he could give her a better superhero name.
With all of the different story lines in this episode, it had the potential to feel very stuffed with characters and a complicated plot. Thankfully, this was not the case. Each story line was given plenty of attention and enough time was devoted to setting up “Legends of Tomorrow” and continuing story lines in past episodes of “The Flash.” Every character was also given enough material and was able to stand out in some way.

And the bragging rights go to the New York Jets, at least for four years. The New York Jets defeated the New York Giants in overtime on Sunday by a score of 23-20. Going into the game, there was a lot of hoopla surrounding a possible matchup of Darrelle Revis and Odell Beckham Jr. Unfortunately, Revis didn’t live up to his end of the bargain as he was sidelined with an injury.
As the game shifted from talking about what-ifs in press conferences and interviews, the Giants were the ones who came out swinging. After the Jets got on the board with a field goal, giving them a 3-0 lead, it was Dwayne Harris who provided a spark and ignited the pro-Giant crowd at MetLife Stadium. On a punt by the Jets, Harris took it 80 yards to the house and gave his team a 7-3 lead. A few possessions later, the Giants added three points and took a 10-3 lead.
Trailing 10-3, the Jets began to get tailback Bilal Powell involved in the action. Powell on the day hauled in eight balls for 91 yards and one of those passes went for a score from 25 yards out to even things up at 10 with 3:30 left in the half. Less than a minute later, Beckham came alive. Up until that point, he had been held to one catch, (A one-handed snag over the middle that left spectators in awe), but one catch nonetheless. He found a soft spot in the Jets’ secondary and took off 72 yards to the end zone, putting the G-Men up 17-10. The Jets tried to put up points at the end of the half, but failed. In doing so, they gave the Giants enough time to add another field goal and make it 20-10 at the intermission.
The third quarter was scoreless and that looked to be a big disadvantage for the Jets who were now facing two enemies: the Giants and the clock. As the fourth quarter opened, the Giants were in the midst of a drive that spanned 11 minutes. They made a choice that will be second-guessed by many critics and decided to go for it on fourth down and two from the Jets four-yard line and forgo an almost automatic three points. Instead of going up 23-10, the Giants went for it and Eli Manning was intercepted, and the Jets suddenly had life.
On the Jets ensuing drive, they marched into Giant territory, but stalled on the six-yard line and had to settle for a field goal, which made it 20-13. On the next Giants possession, the Jets defense stepped up and forced a three-and-out. Down by a touchdown and with 2:40 left, the Jets had a chance to tie it. They started their drive from their own 29 and quickly moved the ball downfield thanks to plays from Powell and scrambles by Ryan Fitzpatrick, including a big one on fourth and six, which went for 15 yards.
With 32 seconds left, the aforementioned Fitzpatrick connected with Brandon Marshall on a fade route and the Jets evened up the score at 20, while the Giants found themselves in a familiar position. The Giants, who opened the year with back-to-back fourth quarter debacles, allowed 10 points to the Jets in the last five minutes of play.
In the overtime, the Jets drove the ball all the way to the Giants eight, but were stopped and forced to kick a field goal. With the Jets up by three and the Giants needing at least a field goal to extend the game, all the pressure fell on Manning. Manning and the offense found themselves in a critical fourth down, but were able to convert thanks to none other than OBJ who hauled in one of his six catches on the day, this one for 20 yards, all the way to the Jets 34-yard line.
A few plays later, the Jets forced the Giants to attempt a 48-yard field and Josh Brown, who hadn’t missed a kick all year, hooked it wide left, giving the Jets a thrilling victory and the Giants a deflating loss.
A lot of what fans expected to see on the field happened. Beckham had his way for the most part with the Jets defenders (he totaled 149 yards on six catches and a TD). The Jets defense was able to stuff
the run. But the big x-factor was the play of Fitzpatrick, who was 36 of 50 passing for 390 yards and two touchdowns. He also accounted for 22 yards on the ground and a couple key first downs, which extended drives.
You can point to multiple spots in the game where the tide began to switch in favor of the Jets, but Giants Head Coach Tom Coughlin needs to take blame for his decision to go for it on fourth down in the fourth quarter and not take three points and go up 23-10. If you kick the field goal, you go up by 13 points and the Jets are now forced to score two touchdowns in a matter of eight minutes and change instead of a touchdown and a field goal. That was the turning point of the game.
As it stands right now, the Jets are 7-5 and are right in the thick of things in a crowded AFC Wildcard picture. The Giants sit at 5-7 and are still in contention in the NFC (L)East. Both have put themselves in position to play meaningful games in December and hopefully playoff games in January.

Woeful, pitiful, inept, and disgraceful are a just a few words used to describe the Los Angeles Lakers since the death of Franchise Owner, Dr. Jerry Buss, back in the spring of 2013.
Formerly known as the ‘Showtime Lakers’, the Lakers as of 2013 wouldn’t even qualify as an opening act for your daughter’s 8th grade dance recital. Since the beginning of the abysmal 2013-14 campaign, the Lakers have amassed 138 losses and just 49 wins; and just to put things further into perspective, the 2014-15 Golden State Warriors, who by the way hoisted the Larry O’Brien trophy this past summer over LeBron and a hapless Cavs team in six, had 42 wins at the all-star break and just nine losses.
Did I mention that the Oklahoma City Thunder; who played 55 games without the 2013-14 League MVP Kevin Durant (due to a multitude of injuries including a season ending broken foot) somehow managed to amass 45 wins last year, while just missing the playoffs as a ninth seed, in a stacked Western Conference.
Sorry folks, but the Lakers are far away from competing for an NBA championship, according to Bleacher Report’s senior NBA writer Kevin Ding.
“When you look at the talent, especially in the stacked Western Conference, it’s safe to say the Lakers are certainly in a rebuild mode,” said Ding, who has covered the Lakers for the past 19 years.
“What makes matters worse for Laker fans is that for the past 20- 30 years (with the exception of the last three seasons), Laker fans know only Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Shaq, Kareem, and oh yeah, Championships,” Ding added.
The demise of the Lakers, on the court, can be traced back to that fateful night in early April 2013, the night Kobe ‘Bean’ Bryant, tore his left achilles tendon. Since then, the organization, as well as their fan base, has seen nothing but loss after loss, whether it be on the court, or in free agency.
“It’s certainly frustrating for Kobe, as well as the organization, to miss out on all these big time free agents,” Ding said. The free agents he is referring to, include stars such as Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony, and most notably, Lamarcus Aldridge, whose camp expressed his displeasure with L.A.’s sales pitch to him this past off-season, before he took his talents to San Antonio.
Bryant received most of the flak for Aldridge’s decision not to become a Laker, after reportedly telling Aldridge; “You can almost be my Pau [Gasol].” However, Ding refuted that report, claiming Bryant was a positive focal point in the organization’s sales pitch to the All-Star Power Forward, who in Ding’s word “wasn’t really cut out for the job anyway” for becoming the centerpiece of a rebuilding NBA franchise.
Nonetheless, the Lakers are currently caught between two eras, managing a fading superstar’s farewell tour, while ushering in a youth movement, with the likes of guards Deangelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, and stretch four Julius Randle, who have all shown plenty of promise in their first year playing together. All despite a 3-15 start to what will most likely be another lost season.
