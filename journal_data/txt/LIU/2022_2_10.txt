The LIU Men’s Ice Hockey team is hitting its stride, and after a much improved season, they faced the defending national champions on a four-game winning streak. There were many games that the Sharks played competitively, but still fell short. However, they are now finally getting the results to show for it. 
After beating Saint Anselem in the program’s first sweep by a combined 15 goals to 1 over two games, they headed to Brown University, where it became the Billy Jerry show. He scored all four goals in a 4-3 win and added another in the Sharks’ 4-1 over Union  College to increase his totals to 11 goals and 12 assists on the season. 
Head Coach Brett Riley broke down what has made his group so successful over the past few games.
“Guys are buying into the way that we need to play to be successful, and it’s like anything, building a program, growing, developing, it takes time. We were pleased with our first half,” he said. “I know the results don’t necessarily show it, but this has been a group that’s resilient and filled with character and with great leadership with guys like Billy (Jerry) taking the reins, so it’s been fun to see the results validate what we’re doing here, but it’s been a really natural progression this whole time now.”
Riley spoke about the program’s growth after starting from scratch last year.
“A short-term goal for us is we want to continue to grow and evolve. Our mission is to pass teams every single day, and we realize that we started at the bottom of college hockey being a new program, and our growth is to continually climb, and I think we’ve done that,” he said. “We’ve passed seven teams this past week with critical wins beating storied programs like Union, who won a national championship six years ago, to Brown, to Miami, who was a national Contender and tying (UMass) Lowell, a top 10 team. Our goal is to prove we belong with college hockey and we couldn’t do it without the culture we’re building.”
Sharks star center Billy Jerry has been a major factor in the Sharks’ success, and Riley touched on what makes him the special player that he is.
“We knew the player, and I had heard great things about the person. We brought Billy in here to be a leader and to bring out that offensive side of his game which is a total testament and credit to the work he’s put in,” he said. “He’s coming off a five-goal week for us here, which is the top performer in college hockey. He has been really exciting, but he’s paid total dividends just as much off the ice as he has on the ice. He does a lot of things that don’t necessarily show on the scoresheet from faceoffs to penalty kill and then what he’s done for our locker room in the cultural games, we can’t thank him enough.”
Billy Jerry gave some insight on how the team develops the younger players.
“A lot of us leaders talk a lot about how we carry ourselves and what we do. It sets the bar and the standard for the rest of the guys. When freshmen come into college hockey, they don’t really know what to expect right away, and we think a big piece of developing both people and players is the culture that you set for them,” he said. “If we can do it the right way and show them how to do things, they should be able to carry over in that they’re going to become leaders themselves one day.”
Jerry was also nominated for the Hobey Baker award, the most valuable player in Men’s College Hockey, and recognized by those around him for helping him get to this position.
“It’s a huge honor for sure. I told Coach [Riley] at the beginning of the year if you said that was something that was going to happen, I probably wouldn’t have believed it,” Jerry said. “I owe a lot of thanks and credit to both the staff for just giving me an opportunity and believing in me, and also my teammates because it’s an individual award, but it reflects on the work the rest of the guys have put in as well.”
After his four-goal game vs. Brown University, Jerry mentioned that the most important thing of the night wasn’t his performance but the overall result.
“It’s a pretty good feeling, but most importantly, the win. We had a couple of games we were in this year where we thought maybe they slipped through our fingers, where we had a lead, and the game got away from us, and we ended up in a tie,” he said. “It was just nice to get the win, and it creates momentum for us as a program going forward here, and we’re going to try and carry that over.”
Jerry touched on how much of an improvement he’s seen from the team after playing some of the toughest opponents in the nation, including Nebraska Omaha, Umass Lowell, Quinnipiac University, Ohio State, Northeastern University and Umass. All these teams are ranked among the top 25 in the country.
“I think the improvement has been tremendous, and we remind the guys we’re playing one of the hardest schedules in the country this year, so those are just building blocks. You want to play against the best of the best each night, and being able to do that, you’re only going to get better,” he said. “I only see the program taking strides up from here. We’re learning how to play against these teams, we’re learning how to win against these teams and we’re going to try to carry that over and see what we can do.”

The LIU Sharks Women’s Basketball team just passed the midpoint of their conference games after their victory against Central Connecticut, with the final score of 74-67. 
Leading the game for the Sharks was Sophomore Dallas Carter, who finished the night with 18 points, all from three-point shots going 6-9 from beyond the arc. 
The Sharks sit at a record of 5-7 in the Northeast Conference(NEC) and are in 6th place. Although the Sharks are behind in the standings, head coach Renee Haynes still sees her team improving every passing day.
“We’ve improved on communication. We have grown to defend better with communication, talk to each other and explain to each other players roles on the court,” she said.
This has shown through LIU’s defensive statistics, as they are currently 2nd place in the NEC in both blocks and steals. Coach Haynes emphasizes her team’s ability to play in the paint.
“I also think that rebounding is something that we pride in. We pride in our hustle and we pride in our toughness. Not every game we’ve shown that but we have pride in it,” she said.
One player who has truly captured LIU’s rebounding identity is senior forward Kiara Bell, who is currently second in rebounding. 
Coach Haynes believes that Brandy Thomas, who is currently leading the team in points, rebounds, and steals, still has room for improvement and continues to do so with each passing day.
 “Even though Brandy has received a lot of accolades throughout her collegiate career, she’s expanded out to the perimeter to become more comfortable and more effective at the three and four positions,” she said.
Thomas, who has won awards such as NEC Rookie of the Year and All-NEC First-Team, continues to be the rock of this LIU team. Haynes is confident that other players will step up as the season comes down to its final stretches.
“I do think that we have had tremendous improvement throughout the season. Last game, Dallas (Carter) had the hot hand, and that’s something that we recruited her to do. She hasn’t been able to show it fully yet, but now she’s becoming more comfortable,” she said.
Carter has had a relatively quiet season so far but is starting to come into her own as one of LIU’s premier shooters. She currently leads the sharks in three-point percentage at nearly 50 percent from beyond the arc. Coach Haynes and the Sharks will compete against Saint Francis Brooklyn on the road Friday, Feb.11.

After two years of cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Coachella Valley Music and Art festival has confirmed they will be returning to the Empire Polo Club in Indio California. 
The event will take place Friday, April 15 through Sunday, April 17 and again on Friday, April 22 through Sunday, April 24. 
Coachella is an annual music festival with performances from popular artists. The festival’s origins trace back to 1993 with performances from Pearl Jam. 
In 1999, the festival started its two day event but in 2001 Coachella returned to their basis as a single-day event. In 2002, the festival reverted back to two-days but in 2007 they expanded to three days. Finally in 2012 they added a second weekend festival.
This year’s headliners include Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, Kanye West and Swedish House Mafia. Other artists performing are Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Baby, 21 Savage, Doja Cat, Carly Rae Jepsen, City Girls, Denzel Curry, Brockhampton, and many more.
Coachella was originally postponed in March 2020 and festival organizers attempted to push the event to October 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was eventually canceled. This was the first year without Coachella in 20 years.
Before the festival was canceled in October, Coachella announced they would no longer require full vaccination for attendees, but after seeing the immense increase in numbers of COVID-19 infected people, Coachella released the following statement, “We feel confident that we can update our health policy to allow for: Negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of the event OR proof of full vaccination,” organizers wrote on social media.
Fans are excited to head back to the desert in California for the weekend to dance and sing along to their favorite artists but some are hesitant about the headliners. 
Adelphi junior Gileen Reyes, discussed how excited she is for Harry Styles to perform.
 “I went to his “Love On Tour” this past Fall and it was honestly one of the best experiences of my life. I am so happy Harry Styles is performing at Coachella this year. He is a well deserved artist and I know he’s going to give it his all during his performances,” Reyes said. 
This will be Styles’ first performance at the event and there are rumors that he may release new music leading up to his performance.
 Styles has not released a new album since his “Fine Line” album on Dec. 13, 2019. He also has just completed his North American Tour, “Love on​​ Tour” and is scheduled to tour in the UK, Europe, and South America starting Saturday, June 11, 2022.
Although many fans agree with Reyes about Styles’ performing there are others who don’t think it is a great idea. 
“I personally don’t hate Harry Styles but they already have Billie Eilish performing who is another popular pop star. When you think about Coachella you automatically think about raves and I feel like they could’ve replaced it with another rock band,” Queens College Junior Lauren Hernandez said.
Though excited at the anticipation of seeing their favorite artists live, some people shared their disappointment at the high prices of tickets.
Tickets for the event went on sale Jan. 14 for $549 and sold-out in minutes. There is currently a waitlist for the first weekend. Prices for the tickets were: $549 for general admission, $633 for general admission with shuttle access, and $1119 for a VIP Pass. 
Tickets from 2020 will be honored.
“As much as I would love to see Kanye West live in concert, $549 is way too expensive. I would rather wait for him to go on tour himself and I could get tickets for $100 instead,” Molloy College Junior Jeorgio Llantino said.
It’s been a long journey for Coachella to be up and running again, but with the unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, nothing is ever certain. As of now, plans for the festival are in full speed and fans are eager to return and dance the night away.

Junior music education major Annie Rodriguez was selected out of hundreds of applicants to compete in the American Pops Orchestra NextGen National Competition on January 29. Rodriguez was chosen out of 30 contestants to make it to the semi-finals.
The American Pops Orchestra (APO) is committed to preserving classic American music. The organization presents concerts that showcase music from all sectors of the American experience featuring the nation’s most talented and celebrated artists. 
The NextGen National: Finding the Voices of Tomorrow competition showcases the next generation of great performers. The competition strives to expose college-aged students to songs with which they are unfamiliar. To enter, contestants must sing pre-1970 American popular songs not found in the Singer’s Musical Theater Anthology for their voice type. 
Selected finalists are invited to perform live with members of The American Pops Orchestra in the final round, with all expenses covered by APO. First place female and male vocalist winners receive a $1,000 scholarship and second place winners each receive a $500 scholarship. All winners also receive a paid performance opportunity with the orchestra.
Rodriguez began singing in fourth grade. She participated in chorus, show choir and musicals in middle school as well as vocal jazz group and glee club in high school. She has also been in the New York All-State Vocal Jazz ensemble in 2018 and the All-Eastern Women’s choir in 2019.
Rodriguez put in several days of work to prepare for the competition. Even though she is familiar with pre-1970 music, she worked hard to perfect her song of choice for the competition.
“In my preparation for this competition, I was able to look through jazz standards. I have sung with Professor Lacona in his studio, as I have been studying with him for almost 2 years now, as we sing a bunch of standards that are all before the 1970s,” she said. 
It is important to decide upon a song that works the best with the singer’s voice and style of singing.
“I ended up choosing ‘In the Arms of Love’ by Henry Mancini. We chose a day to record in a practice room of the 32-bar cut and sent it to the NextGen competition hosted by the American Pops Orchestra,” she said. 
After making it to the semi-finals, contestants were required to attend a performance and film workshop and had to record themselves again for the next step of the competition. She felt she gave a great performance and truly enjoyed the experience. 
Rodriguez is studying music education and is looking to pursue a career teaching music. 
“We must allow students to find ways to access and express their creative potential for their own sake. Ultimately, my role as a future music educator will be teaching my students how to be good humans and productive members of society. Through music, I will engage students in activities that require them to be creative, disciplined, flexible, and work cooperatively with others,” she said.
Rodriguez does not currently have any competitions or auditions lined up for the future as she is focusing on her studies and preparing for her senior year at Post.

Many people are well acquainted with the ancient tradition of Groundhog Day, whether it be from their nostalgic childhoods or the classic film starring Bill Murray. Children from across the world are enamored with the tradition of the groundhog coming out of its hidey hole to see whether winter will drag on or not.
Originally, Groundhog Day was called Imbolc, and was celebrated by the Celts. It was a pagan festival used to ring in the beginning of spring. As time went on, it evolved into Candlemas. Europeans believed that if Candlemas was sunny, there would be 40 more days of winter.
Germans in particular believed that the day would only be sunny if badgers and other small mammals saw their shadows.When Germans immigrated to Pennsylvania later on, they brought the custom with them.
However, there has been an ongoing debate over the holiday in recent years.
Groundhog Day has no major significance in any religion that humanity knows of. It also does not mark any major historical event in any nation’s history. It does not even involve a day off from school or work.
The concept itself has the potential to raise eyebrows among outsiders to the tradition. The concept behind Groundhog Day is that a groundhog comes out of a hole to supposedly determine whether winter will end early or not. It is a superstition that could match the likes of Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.
Some students think that this holiday is peculiar.
“It was probably established to give a sense of hope through winter to the next spring. So it is useful, but still pretty weird,” senior acting major Aubrey Shadle said.
Other students have similar feelings towards the day.
“It’s fun. I don’t believe in it but think it’s a fun way to celebrate and connect with people,” sophomore musical theatre major Abbie Brown said.
Sophomore musical theatre major Kristen Mestre says one of her favorite things about the holiday is knowing if the groundhog sees his shadow.
Students believe that Groundhog Day is not about a groundhog or even a time loop, but instead about giving hope for a flower-filled spring in the midst of a bleak winter. Peculiar as it may be, Groundhog Day is a message of hope to students.

Author of acclaimed book series “Percy Jackson & the Olympians,” Rick Riordan, announced that the franchise is producing a Disney+ series revisioning the critically acclaimed New York Times bestseller on Jan. 25. 
The series will follow the life and adventures of Percy Jackson, a 12-year-old boy that finds out he is a half-god and his normal life was actually a lie.
According to Riordan, the first season will follow the first novel in the series “Percy Jackson and The Lightning Thief” in which Percy is forced to find Zeus’ lightning bolt or else a war will break out between the gods. 
In 2010, there was an attempt to bring the children’s books to the big screen, as a movie directed by Chris Columbus was released in theaters. Just three years later, a second movie was released following the second book in the series titled “Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters.” 
The two movies brought in a decent amount of money, but were met with a good amount of criticism from critics and reviewers. 
Senior acting major Carrie Lenza remembers when they had first seen the movies back in theaters. 
“I did watch the two movies. I did not like them. The plot, characters, and tone were all completely inaccurate to the books, which was really disappointing because I really enjoyed the books,” Lenza said. “The new plots and character developments were also not particularly engaging, in my opinion, even aside from just not staying faithful to the books.” 
To cover this concern from fans and keep the new Disney+ series accurate to the books, Riordan has been involved in the script writing process for the show. In a post made on his personal blog, Riordan talked about the process of writing the show script. 
“Our writers’ room continues to meet every week, and I am always in every meeting. The team continues to be absolutely wonderful,” Riordan said. “We have delivered the first four scripts (which is what we needed for the green light) and are now working on some revisions based on the studio’s feedback… A large part of this spring will be spent finishing up the season one scripts. I can tell you with 100% confidence that this season follows “The Lightning Thief” faithfully, although we’re adding a lot of interesting nuances, depth, Easter eggs and backstory that will keep the story fresh and fun even if you know the books inside and out.” 
Filming for the show is projected to begin this summer in Vancouver, but as of now, the casting auditions have just begun for the roles of the main characters: Percy, Annabeth and Grover. 
On Twitter following this announcement, people complained that the actor who portrayed Percy Jackson in the original movies, Logan Lerman, should reprise his role in the TV series. 
Junior musical theater major on a pre medical track, Nick Larsen, gave his opinion on the Twitter argument and who he believed should be considered for the role. 
“I think that would be cool as he [Lerman] did a decent job, even though they all looked a bit too old, but also I think someone like Asa Butterfield might not be bad,” Larsen said. “I’m sure they could also find a newer actor to play him to make it more accurate to the books but I don’t think the casting was the main problem of the original movies so I’m not worried about who they end up casting.” 
The new Percy Jackson Disney+ series is still months away from being brought to fruition, but Riordan in his announcement laid out a foundation that provides optimism to fans of the book series that influenced their childhood.

Three years since he last released music, British singer-songwriter Rex Orange County released his new album’s lead single “Keep It Up” alongside a fun dance music video that takes place in Amsterdam on Jan.26. 
His new album titled “Who Cares?” will be released March 11 featuring 11 songs: “Keep It Up”, “Open A Window” featuring Tyler the Creator, “Worth it,” “Amazing,” “One In A Million,” “If You Want It,” “7AM,” “The Shade,” “Making Time,” “Shoot Me Down” and “Who Cares?” 
This is Rex’s fourth studio album and a follow up to his 2019 album  “Pony.” Rex released “Bcos U Will Never B Free” in 2016 and “Apricot Princess” in 2017.
Alongside the release of the single, Rex surprised fans with the announcement of a tour. 
Rex will be traveling to North America, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. He kicks off his tour in Miami, Fla. on May 4, 2022 and will finish his tour in London on August 13, 2022.
In the “Keep It Up” music video, Rex uses a grain filter to create a vintage aesthetic. In the video, Rex is accompanied by musician Benny Sings as he dances and performs through Amsterdam. The video utilizes an orchestral opening while capturing his longtime fans. 
Fans all over twitter are ecstatic for what’s to come for the artist and are already predicting what the new album will sound like. 
One twitter user described it as a “playful record by an artist in a playful mood.” 
Junior at Queens College Lauren Hernandez is one of Rex’s biggest fans. She has been following Rex since 2017.
“I’ve been a fan ever since his album “Apricot Princess.” It’s the way he is with his lyrics and turns it into something beautiful. I am so excited for his new album that I recently bought tickets for his upcoming tour,” Hernandez said. 
There are many people who believe Rex isn’t as talented of an artist his fans say he is. His music often faces criticism for being too sad, but his fan base always comes to his defense.
Another fan, Molloy College sophomore Catherine Torres, is quick to defend Rex and his music against critics.. 
“Rex really knows how to turn conversational descriptions of emotion into poetry. He sings songs like he’s talking but it feels like poetry,” Torres said.
Senior FIT student Christian Dorota wasn’t as thrilled after the new song was released. 
“After listening to the new song I wasn’t expecting a playful vibe so I have mixed feelings about the song. I apologize to his fans but I don’t even think he’s that good like he has some good songs but they’re kind of boring,” Dorota said.
There are mixed feelings about his new song but regardless fans are looking forward to hearing Rex’s new album. It has been three years since his last release and fans are holding out high hopes for the album.

         The second season of “Euphoria” premiered on HBO max on Jan. 9 and viewers of the show were hooked
“Euphoria” is a series that takes the audience inside the mind of Rue, a drug addict, played by Zendaya–and her peers around her. Each character has their own story and conflict that they are trying to work through.
       “The basis of the show is that every character is addicted to something, whether it be physical drugs, an emotion, or something else entirely,” sophomore education major Robert Metzger said.
         Many believe that this show speaks on important issues that many people in their teens to early adulthood face. The issue of drugs and alcohol is present, along with the lack of self confidence and positive self-image.
 Euphoria shows the viewers what issues each character has to deal with. It shows the audience each characters’ journey through facing these issues, which are issues that can occur in the real world, and many feel as though it is important to address this.
         “I think that “Euphoria” is important because it brings awareness to many social and mental issues that are not paid enough attention to day-to-day,” Metzger said.
Since these are scenarios that can occur in the real world, many viewers of the show believe that they should be spoken about more. 
         “I feel like a lot of the topics brought up in “Euphoria” should be talked about more since many people deal with different issues that are similar to those in the show,” sophomore business major Lauren Ritirato said.
         Along with Rue and her drug addiction, viewers see how the other characters deal with what they’re going through too. Nate struggles with his anger and stress; he often lets it consume him and takes it out on others around him. Kat constantly seeks others’ approval and Lexi struggles with being a loyal friend and often not receiving the same loyalty back. Cassie is addicted to the feeling of being wanted by someone else and Jules faces the issue of being tied down instead of freely doing what she wants.
         “Maddy is unaware of her self-worth. She is trapped in a toxic relationship and she does not know how to be her genuine self without her abusive boyfriend, Nate,” Metzger said.
         Although most viewers understand that “Euphoria” is a show for mature audiences with more emotional and heavy scenes than other shows, Zendaya felt it necessary to issue a warning that the new season may be a bit more extreme than the first.
         A.V. Club released an article on Zendaya’s warning.
 “The show’s Emmy-winning star Zendaya took to Instagram to warn fans that the show’s content might be heavier than what they were expecting,” the article stated.
         Within the Instagram post, Zendaya reiterates that “Euphoria” is for mature audiences and she advises viewers only to watch if they feel comfortable as there are subjects brought up in the show that may be triggering to some.
         “I think it was very smart and thoughtful to remind the viewers of the show that some scenes may be difficult to watch for a lot of people and it shows that she truly does care about her fans and doesn’t want them to begin watching it without a warning,” Ritirato said.
         Many fans were shocked when they saw that Zendaya felt the need to emphasize on this and made sure to prepare themselves for the season to come.

Store shelves are filled with hearts of chocolate and Instagram pages are filled with happy couples. It’s once again Valentine’s Day, a bitter day of loneliness for many who find themselves without a partner. 
Junior music education major Brett Herman never had strong feelings about Valentine’s Day, but he valued having an excuse to see his girlfriend. Now that they’re broken up there doesn’t seem to be much of a reason to celebrate. He will be spending this Valentine’s Day alone.
Valentine’s Day is a true celebration of love for some, but without a special someone it’s easy to feel alone this holiday. However, love exists in more ways than one, and many students are using this “Hallmark holiday” as a chance to appreciate those around them. 
Sophomore business major Lauren Ritirato would ideally spend Valentine’s day with the person she loves. Staying in, baking or watching a cheesy romcom. However Ritirato is one of the many students across campus who’s single this Valentine’s Day. 
“Although it is nice to have a specific person to celebrate with, at the end of the day I think Valentine’s Day is what we make of it, single or not,” Ritirato said. 
Although Ritirato doesn’t have any plans for Valentine’s Day, she wants to take the opportunity to remind her close friends and family how much she loves them.
“I think Valentine’s Day is a nice day to celebrate love, platonically and romantically. Even though we tell the people close to us that we love them throughout the year, Valentine’s Day is a nice reminder of how loved we are and the potential we have to love others,” Ritirato said.
Senior fine arts major Sara Halverson doesn’t need a partner in order to enjoy herself.  Despite her relationship status, she still intends to wear a cute outfit and have a fun day. 
“My last two Valentine’s Days were boring. I’m kind of glad to not spend it with a man this year,” Halverson said.
  Halvorsen will be spending Valentine’s Day with her best friends. She plans to go to the Roosevelt Field mall and make a stuffed animal at Build-a-Bear Workshop. Then, she’ll finish off the night off with a movie.
Halverson values the love she receives from those around her and she doesn’t believe that the love someone gives or receives should be dictated by the time of the year.
“The ideal way to spend the holiday is to just do something special. It shouldn’t be an excuse to be nice. You should be doing nice things throughout the year,” Halverson said.

If there is one staple ingrained into the life-blood of New York City (NYC), it would have to be its cherished transportation system. The city-wide transportation services perpetually keeps the city moving, day and night. NYC runs -or rather sits on- its subway and bus systems. 
Even now, two years deep into the ever-evolving COVID-19 pandemic, there is still a dedicated daily ridership. 
According to MTA statistical data, on Jan. 31, 2022, an estimated 2.5 million people rode the subway and Staten Island railroads, as well as a 1.1 million rode on one of the MTA’s many bus routes. This is just the sum of a single day’s worth of travel in the big apple. 
That being said, one form of transportation that does not make the daily news and operates in the background of the NYC transportation scene- the NYC ferry system. 
Ferry travel in NYC might very well be one of its longest standing forms of transportation, with ferry usage being documented as far back as 1654. As far back as the river-faring form of transportation goes, the ferry is not particularly busy for a populus boasting well over 8 million residents. 
According to NYC Ferry collected-statistics, the ferry with the highest estimated ridership from July 1st, 2021 to September 30th 2021 was the East River Ferry, which averaged about 13,709 people weekly. The lowest was none other than the St. George Ferry, which averaged 2,318 people during the same time period. 
More commonly known as the Long Island Ferry, the St. George Ferry travels from the northern tip of Staten Island to Midtown West Manhattan. 
On that note, it was a surprise to many when a formerly decommissioned Staten Island Ferry known as the John F. Kennedy was bought by none other than SNL hosts and NYC natives Pete Davidson and Colin Jost. 
The Saturday Night Live co-hosts recently announced their participation in buying the ferry on a skit aired on the late night talk show. 
“My boy coy-joy and his ‘SNL’ boy-toy are saying a hoy- hoy to an aquatic toy-toy. That’s right. Colin and Pete have bought a ferry boat everybody,” co-star Alex Moffat said in a skit on the show.
The “Weekend Update: Three Guys Who Just Bought A Boat” took a whimsical approach to the seemingly daunting task of purchasing and restoring the nearly 50-year-old monument to NYC travel.
“It sounds like they could have [success] with it,” said health science sophomore Anthony Tilles. “I think we’re nearing the end of the pandemic, so it seems like a good idea.” 
The John F. Kennedy had previously retired in August of 2021,and was recently purchased by the two comedy giants to be reconstructed into a live entertainment, arts and food venue. 
“I don’t think the [city] should . . . there are other stuff they should be focusing on,” said sophomore nursing major Elaine Claire. “We’re still not in control of [COVID-19], so opening something like that is just risking it.” 
The settled bid amount set the trio back $280,000. The auction was held about a month before the episodes airing and their initial announcement, with the bidding being placed by the third member of the buying party, under the alias “Pitalia211.” Paul Italia is a co-owner of the New York City comedy club The Stand, which has hosted its fair share of A-list comedians, including Dave Chappelle, Josh Johnson and Marc Maron. 
The only thing standing between Davison and Jost and Manhattan’s next trending entertainment venue is finding a place to dock it, which could prove to be their biggest hurdle yet. 
“They don’t know where they’re docking it, so that’s one thing I see as a red flag,” freshman business major Andres Glasgow said. “If you don’t have a solid plan, where they’re going to dock it, I don’t think it makes sense funneling money into it.” 
The newly-made ferry owners have turned to the recently elected Mayor Adams for answers about where to dock it. 
According to the New York Post, the mayor had reportedly tweeted to Jost and Davidson on Twitter saying he loved their plans.
 “Let us know how we can help and we’ll be there for the maiden voyage,” Adams said on Twitter. 
If the ferry remains undocked, the comedy crew could face thousands in fines.

At the age of 22, YouTuber Gabby Petito was living out of her van, traveling the world with her fiance Brian Laundrie. The couple’s plan was a four-month road trip to sight-see and visit national parks throughout the country, all while Petito posted vlog content of the trip on her YouTube channel. The couple set off from Long Island, N.Y. on July 2, 2021. Petito posted to her Instagram and YouTube accounts numerous times while traveling. In July, she posted pictures from Kansas, Colorado and Utah. 
On August 12, the couple was stopped in Utah by police following a witness report of an altercation between a couple. When Officers arrived at the scene, they found Petito crying and in a disoriented demeanor. Body cam footage was released to the public, where Petito said “Yeah, I don’t know if some days, I have really bad OCD. I was just cleaning and straightening up, back in the … I was apologizing to him and saying, “I’m sorry, that I’m so mean,” because sometimes I have OCD and sometimes I can get really frustrated.” Laundrie however, turns the story around onto Petito, claiming she scratched him, as he shows the officers his forearm.
 On Aug. 27, witness Nina Angelo posted on her social media the couple arguing at a restaurant in Wyoming. This would be the last time the couple is seen together. 
Aug. 30 was the last known day of communication from Petito. The last text, sent to Petito’s mother read “Can you help Stan, I just keep getting his voicemails and missed calls”. 
According to Petito’s mother, the text message was a little suspicious, and led to confusion about the validity of it being her who sent the message. This is because Petito hadn’t called her grandfather–Stan–by his first name before.
On Sept.1, Laundrie returned home to North Port Florida, without Petito. 
Petito was reported missing by her parents on Sept. 11. At that time, Laundrie’s parents had hired a lawyer and Laundrie refused to talk to the press about the case. It wasn’t until four days later, on Sept. 15, when Laundrie was named a person of interest. On Sept. 17, Laundrie’s parents reported him missing. On Sept. 18, searches for both Laundrie and Petito were conducted by the police. One day later, on Sept. 19, Petitos body was found. The cause of death is strangulation. 
On Sept. 23, a warrant issued by the District Court of Wyoming, was made for Laundrie’s arrest, after he used Petitos debit card to withdraw a large amount of money from an ATM. On Oct. 20, human remains that resembled Laundrie were found in Florida. After dental testing, the remains were confirmed to be Laundrie. The cause of death determined by police is suicide. Laundrie shot himself in the head with a gun. Next to his remains was a notebook, and on Jan. 21, 2022, the notebook revealed that Laundrie murdered Petito.
Students at Post share their opinions of the case; Ejay Pegg , a theater major studying at Post, provides an interesting side to this case
Sophomore theatre major Ejay Pegg attended the same high school as Petito, and was shocked to hear about Petito’s death.
“It was all that my graduating class was talking about at the time,” Pegg said.
Pegg says that Petito is not the first murder case from their high school that blew up on social media.
“Newfield Highschool is infamous of another murder case that happened,” Pegg said.
On TikTok alone, #Gabbypetito has 1.9 billion views. 
Sophomore criminal justice major Annabel Barlow thinks that the lack of police work during this investigation impacted Petito’s case immensely.
“There was a lot of criticism over what the police were doing and there definitely are some interesting points on that because I do believe the police didn’t have him labeled as a suspect as soon as he should have,” Barlow said.
Overall, cases like Petito’s highlight the impact that social media users have on investigations.

The UCLA Gymnastics Bruins has been under the spotlight in the media due to a recent racial scandal occurring within the team. Former UCLA freshman gymnast Alexis Jeffery, after being admitted to UCLA on a full athletic scholarship, transferred to LSU Gymnastics as a walk-on for the spring semester after being accused of saying racial slurs towards Black and Asian people.
Ever since the death of George Floyd, the UCLA Gymnastics team has been consistently vocal on the racial inequality issues that have been occurring nationwide. But with the recent controversy, the athletic department at the school, as well as the coaches of the team, haven’t been as outspoken about the matter as they famously have been in the past by refusing to put out a statement on the situation until the public, as well as the gymnasts on the team had publicly called them out for it.
On Jan. 26, in a podcast by Amanda Seals called Small Doses, Seals welcomed two Black gymnasts from the UCLA Gymnastics team: Seniors Margzetta Frazier and Sekai Wright. Seals believed it was important to give these two women a platform for their voice.
“I wanted to bring them out here today because I don’t think it’s fair that the story is only being told by one side,” Seals said.
In this podcast, these two women shared their experiences with Seals, not only about Jeffrey but also about the coaching staff at UCLA Gymnastics. And though, both Frazier and Wright shared their stories, Frazier took the lead throughout the podcast from the beginning.
“We’ve been in silence for three months about this problem,” Frazier said.
Before the situation got out of control, Wright says that she had taken Jeffrey in as a sister and showed her the ropes of college and being a student-athlete. But once the racial statements Jeffrey made got out of control, Wright decided to distance herself from Jeffrey and the situation in fear of being a target.
“When she [Jeffrey] came in, she kind of attached onto me… there were a couple times where she said somethings that were kind of inappropriate, and I checked her about it, and things were never said again to me,” Wright said on Small Doses. “I told the coaches I didn’t want to be involved in it at first just because I have dealt with situations like this [racism] before. I already knew myself and how I would react to the situation so I just stood back because I didn’t wanna be a target.” 
Jeffrey had denied the allegations after a teammate explained why her comments were hurtful and when the leaders came to the realization that Jeffrey had made inappropriate and racial comments on more than one occasion, Frazier asked her coaches what Jeffrey’s consequences were.
“There’s rules when you steal, there’s rules when you fail a drug test, there’s gotta be rules when you’re racist or a bully, so what are they?” Frazier asked. 
The response of the coaches was not something that Frazier nor her team wanted to hear. 
“We want to take Lexi [Jeffrey] in and really educate her on what she did wrong,” she said.
On Jan. 25, head coach of LSU Gymnastics, Jay Clark, confirmed in a press conference that Jeffrey was an active member of the roster and will be eligible to compete for LSU as soon as possible. 
“There is not an issue within our team surrounding this or anything else right now,” Clark said. 
Jeffrey has still yet to apologize to the UCLA Gymnastics team, or seek any punishment for her wrongdoings.
Members of the LIU Gymnastics team have their own opinions about the situation, and believe that the sport of gymnastics is supposed to be a loving environment and actions such as Jeffrey’s should not be tolerated at any school.
Sophomore gymnast Riley Goldberg, who is from California, and has close friends that are on the UCLA Gymnastics team, wonders what will happen next.
“After speaking to some of my friends that are on the team and hearing that some of the girls want the head coach fired for not taking the matter seriously enough, I wonder if the athletic department will do their part in giving them what they want after everything they’ve been through,” Goldberg said.
Freshman gymnast Ilka Juk believes that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) should have gotten involved and that her actions should’ve received larger repercussions than she did.
“I just can’t believe she [Jeffrey] got off scot-free. If she was in a professional work setting, which in a way she was, she would’ve gotten fired so I think that the NCAA should’ve at least suspended her and her eligibility for competing as an athlete. Shame on Lexi, shame on Chris Waller, and shame on Jay Clark,” Juk said.
