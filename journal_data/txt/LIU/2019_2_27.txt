Senior business major Connor Farrell is one of the school’s multi-sport student athletes, on the football and lacrosse teams. Since 2015, he has played football as a middle linebacker in the fall and entered the faceoff position for the lacrosse team in the spring. Farrell ended his football college career as NE10 conference champion in fall 2018, and for his last college lacrosse season this spring, his goal is set even higher. He wants to be best in the nation.
 Farrell started playing football when he was 8 years old after being inspired by Lawrence Taylor, a former football player for the New York Giants. “My dad made me watch his VCR tapes when I was little; he locked me in my room and made me watch the tape over and over and over again,” Farrell said. Then he was hooked.
One year later, Farrell started his lacrosse career at the urging of his football coach, who also coached a lacrosse team. “He said I got to hit people with lacrosse sticks so I thought that would be pretty fun,” Farrell said.
Entering college, Farrell was only supposed to play football, but after losing a bet to a friend who lived down the hallway in his freshman dorm, he was standing in the lacrosse faceoff circle. “They needed a faceoff guy, so I told him, I will play lacrosse with you guys if you last more than 10 seconds with me in a wrestling match,” Farrell said. The friend lasted 15 seconds in the match and Farrell’s lacrosse college career begun.
Farrell describes himself as a competitive person. He wants to be best at what he does and is always up to a challenge. Playing two sports combined with college studies have put him up for a real test. “My freshman and sophomore years, I had a little trouble studying. I used to be going from football practice right to lacrosse practice in the spring, but it got better and my coaches really helped me with my studies,” he said. “It was very difficult but I liked the challenge.”
Finding enough time for schoolwork in between practices hasn’t been Farrell’s only challenge. During the summer before entering his junior year, he got a head injury. One day he woke up with blurred vision on his right eye. “I had a minor stroke,” Farrell said. “It was very hard to go through.”
With friends and family surrounding him with positive energy, Farrell had his
mind set on a fast recovery to be able to
play football in the fall.

“I overcame it. I worked hard to get
back to where I was and I became even
better, I believe,” he said. When football
season came he was ready to go and he
played in all 10 games of the season.

Farrell has won the NE10 conference championship with the football team both in 2016 and 2018 and the ECC championship with the lacrosse team in 2016. For his last college lacrosse season, he wants a national championship. “I think we have good weapons,” he said. Individually, he wants to be the best “faceoff guy” in the nation. Currently he has a faceoff percentage of 89.3 percent after two games. “In my mind, I don’t think anyone can beat me,” Farrell said.

The Pioneers e-sports team ended their fourth “League of Legends” match against the NYIT Bears on Thursday, Feb. 21, with a loss of 2-0, making them 4-0 for the season. The team previously went against Molloy College on Feb. 15 (L 2-0), Saint Thomas Aquinas College on Feb. 8 (L 2-0), and Southern New Hampshire University pm Feb. 1 (L 2-0). Although the Pioneers did not secure the win against NYIT, the team still had exceptional plays. 
The match had two rounds of Summoner’s
Rift (the standard map for LOL matches), a 5v5
map with three lanes, top, mid, and bottom.
Typically players position themselves in one of
the lanes with one on top, one on mid, two on
bottom, and one in the jungle.

Senior Kalvin “Fallexiga” Dang played Sion and Gnar on top lane. Sophomore Kelsey “FrostVoltage” Catanjal took middle lane while playing Vel’Koz and Lissandra. Graduate Reid “Rexisdead” Erickson took the jungle as Kin- dred and Kayn. The bottom lane was secured by Sophomore Willis “Cold Kirel” Li playing Morgana and Rakan and junior Tim “HOBO” Mcintyre playing Jhin and Kai’Sa. 
Champion synergy and little mistakes made throughout the match contributed to the Pioneers’ first loss of the night. Team captain Cold Kirel noted there were “problems going through the strategy. [We] did not put enough pressure on bottom lane, allowing the Bears to push for the win.” The Bears managed to win the laning phase with the Pioneers’ weak defense against their push. Rexisdead was caught in the jungle multiple times. The Bears capitalized on his positioning and took over the Pioneers’ bottom lane. 
During the second round, the Pioneers demonstrated skilled individual play. Fallexiga managed to intercept a dive from the Bears, who were setting up to take out the outer top turret (a tower on the map) and make an advance. Before a team fight could initiate, Frost-Voltage was picked off in the mid lane. Fallexige pulled back from the Bears’ Malphite, Vladimir, and Ivern. He neared the inner turret with less than 300 health (HP) and activated Mega Gnar. With enough health, he picked off both Malphite and Vladimir. Ivern attempted to retreat, but was taken out by an auto attack. 
The Pioneers eSports team formed in the fall, with players who have little to no experience in ECC games, and no coach for the team other than the student team captain. But they still held their ground. The shotcalling and decisiveness made by Cold Kirel, Fallexige sticking to his guns in a 1v3, and FrostVoltage’s above average creep score made up for rookie mistakes- the makings of a great team. The Pioneers will play their last match of the season on Friday, March 1 against Daemen College in the eSports Arena in Hillwood Commons.

The men’s and women’s lacrosse teams opened their first home games on Saturday, Feb. 23 with wins. The men played against St. Anselm College (ranked #11) in their second home game of the season, and the women played against Merrimack College (ranked #16) in their home and season opener. 
Not even a minute in the first quarter of the men’s game, freshman attackman Jake Gillis gave the Pioneers an early lead, which they held the rest of the game. Soon after his first goal, Gillis quickly added another, giving the Pioneers a 2-0 lead. Gillis finished the game with four goals and one assist. 
In the second half, the St. Anselm Hawks
threatened a little bit as they scored four
unanswered goals, making the score 7-5. The
Pioneers’ offense was just too powerful for the
Hawks, as the Pioneers continued to get of-
fensive help from sophomore attackman Will
Snelders (2 goals 1 assist), junior midfielder
Mike Kadner (3 goals), junior midfielder Dan
Foley (2 goals). Redshirt junior midfielder
Thomas Liantonio, junior midfielder Nick
Grassa, senior midfielder Frank Ranfone, and
junior attackman Alex Russell each added one
goal each.

Liantonio had a big day, as he led the Pioneers with six points (1 goal, 5 assists). Senior goalie Bryan Ochs had a career high of 18 saves, earning his second win of the season. The men’s team will next face Pace University on March 2 at home at at 1 p.m. 
The women kicked off their first game of the season with a strong performance from their freshman goalie Hailey Duchnowski. In her collegiate debut, Duchnowski made 12 saves and kept Merrimack scoreless in the second half. The Pioneers took the lead early as they went 3-0 thanks to junior midfielders Paige Sherlock, Alyssa Mallery, and Brianna Feldman. 
Sherlock scored the first goal of the 2019 season on a free position shot. At the end of the first half, the Pioneers led 5-2. With a strong defensive outing in the second half, they held Merrimack to no goals in the second half. Junior attacker Angela Deren and sophomore attacker Jamie Alvino each caused two turnovers, while Mallery led the team with four ground balls and three draw controls. 
“It felt good to finally end preseason and get
into the swing of things,” Sherlock said. I think
we played very well defensively and we have a
solid foundation of things to build on for our
upcoming games.”

The women’s second game is against Southern Connecticut State University at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 27 at home. They also face Bentley University on Saturday, March 2 at 12 p.m. in Waltham, Mass.

Ariana Grande released her highly anticipated album, “thank u, next” on Feb. 8. This is Grande’s first album without featured artists on any of the 12 tracks. Three songs from this album, “7 rings,” “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored,” and “thank u, next” were ranked No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 list during the week of Feb. 23, the first time an act held all three spots since The Beatles. The album itself launched at No. 1 in the Billboard 200 in the same week. 
Grande wrote the album with her closest friends, and it reflects her innermost thoughts and feelings on issues like the death of her ex- boyfriend and rapper, Mac Miller, her engagement and break up with SNL comedian Pete Davidson, her relationship with the media, and with herself. 
The first track on the album is “imagine,”
which she released as a promotional single on
Dec. 14, 2018. “Imagine” creates a vision of
a world in which Grande and her significant
other live without the pressures of fame.

Grande portrays a simple, easy-going love
that most people can only imagine. The soft
trap beats paired with airy vocals create a feel-
good vibe that can be played on repeat without
sounding too repetitive.

The second track, “needy,” reveals a side of Grande that most listeners can relate to: sometimes we don’t know what we want, and sometimes we want too much. In “needy,” she opens up about her feelings of anxiety and how it affects her relationships, as heard in the lyrics “lately I’ve been on a rollercoaster / tryna get ahold of my emotions / but all that I know is I need you close.” 
Sonically, “needy” takes on a lo-fi (low
frequency), chill hip hop vibe throughout a
majority of the song. The background vocals,
which were done by her best friends Tayla Parx
and Victoria Monet, are subtle and match the
delicacy of the song.

Next is “NASA,” which describes the need
for personal space and self-exploration in a
relationship. She says, “it ain’t nothing wrong
with saying I need me time.” It’s a reminder not
to revolve your entire life around a relationship
or to get too comfortable in the routine of being
with someone.

“Bloodline,” the fourth track on this album, features a sound bite of Grande’s grandmother, Nona, saying “because I’m trying to do the best I can and they can’t find anything to satisfy me, ugh.” On this track, Grande shows she’s not ready to settle down and is only trying to have fun. Since her breakup with Davidson, Grande has been single. In an interview on the “Zach Sang Show,” Grande said, “It’s closed for renovation… all of me, until further notice.” 
Next is “fake smile,” which shows Grande’s  new attitude towards the rest of the world.
After everything she’s dealt with in the last
few years, she’s done pretending and hiding
her emotions. The best part of the song is the
bridge: “If I’m hard, I ain’t gon’ lie about it /
arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted / If
I’m mad I ain’t gon lie about it / neck roll with
the attitude.” Given the honest and powerful
lyrics, the smooth beats and tight transitions
between the verses, it is undeniable that this
song issa bop.

The sixth track, “bad idea” may be underwhelming at first with its minimalistic lyrics. But the honesty in the lyrics shows. Grande knows she isn’t ready for another committed relationship and just wants someone who will work as a temporary distraction to keep her from the “bad idea” to go running back to her ex. She knows acting out this bad idea isn’t healthy for her, which is why she says, “I’ma call you over here to numb the pain,” and “forget about it, yeah / forget about him, yeah / forget about me.” 
The shortest track on the album, at 2:20, “make up,” is a fun, light hearted song about the thrill of making up after fighting with your significant other. The length of the song perfectly captures the fleetingly passionate moment. Grande says, “It’s mood, it’s vibe…” 
The next track is one that Grande told Zach
Sang she doesn’t listen to often, and was the
hardest to write. This is because of the raw
intensity of emotion and truthfulness that
comes with it. “Ghostin” talks about the inner
struggles Grande faced as she processed Mac
Miller’s death and her feelings for him, while
engaged to Davidson.

The lines, “You’ve been so understanding,
you’ve been so good / And I’m putting you
through more than one ever should / And I’m
hating myself cause you don’t want to / Admit
that it hurts you…” gives us a glimpse of her
relationship with Davidson. Grande admits her
faults and acknowledges not only her pain, but
Davidson’s pain as well. On Twitter, Grande
said “ghostin” is about “feeling badly for the
person you’re with bc you love somebody else.
Feeling badly bc he can’t compare… and how I
should be ghosting him.”

“In my head” Grande could also be talking, in part, about Miller. She refers to Miller as “angel” several times on this album, and on social media, so it’s easy to connect the dots on this track. On Twitter, Grande said the song is about “being in love [with] a version of somebody you’ve created in your head. Falling for someone that they’re not.” The lines, “everything you are made you everything you aren’t” could represent Miller’s fame (everything you are) leading to his use of drugs (everything you aren’t). 
The last three tracks on this album were all
released as promotional singles, and are the
only three songs with music videos (so far).
Grande wrote track 10, “7 rings,” with help
from Parx.

Grande is living her best life in this song.
The title “7 rings” comes from the actual seven
matching diamond rings Grande bought from
Tiffany and shared with her six closest friends.
Reminiscent of The Sound of Music’s “My
Favorite Things,” Grande turns the classic tune
into another successful bop.

The title track “thank u, next” blew charts on its Nov. 3, 2018 release. The song is a touching tribute to her past relationships, the lessons she learned from each of them, and her readiness to move on. In the second verse, Grande sings “Plus I met someone else / we havin better discussions (…) ‘Cause her name is Ari / And I’m so good with that.” This shows she’s taking the time to focus on loving herself. 
The last and possibly most controversial
track on this album is “break up with your
girlfriend, i’m bored.” On the first listen, the
lyrics seem easy to understand; Grande is after
someone else’s boyfriend, who she just met.
But the music video is where it gets confusing.
It seems that Grande is actually after the girl,
not the guy.

During the lines, “You can say I’m hatin’ if you want to / But I only hate on her ‘cause I want you / Say I’m trippin’ if you feel that / But you without me ain’t right,” in the music video, Grande is looking into a mirror, but the girlfriend is on the other side of the glass. A surprise twist at the end of the video also leads to the idea that this song has a double meaning. Since this song comes after “thank u, next” where we know Grande “met someone else” named “Ari,” it’s easy to assume that the last track is a song about wanting to be with herself. 
“Thank u, next,” is available to stream on
Spotify and retails for $13.99 at Target. I highly
recommend giving this album a listen.

The game “Overwatch” has been more creative with its various “skins,” or alternate appearances, for its large roster of heroes. The game has not only been praised for how creative the skins are, but also for how historically accurate they have been regarding which hero gets what skins. 
With the new set of skins, in honor of the
Lunar New Year of the pig which began Jan.
24, the developers of Overwatch have once
again shown they conducted their research and
know their heroes’ personalities.

In the latest update to the game, a great deal of respect is paid to one of China’s greatest historical novels, “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” a 14th century masterpiece melding fiction and history during the division of China between the states of Shu, Wu, and Wei. One of the skins draws inspiration from “Lu Bu,” one of the most horrific villains during this time period. This skin is available for the greatest antagonist in the game, Reaper. The connections between these two go beyond them being evil; Lu Bu was a monster in both strength and personality, much like Reaper. 
“They’re interesting reimagings of those
figures as Overwatch heroes,” Jordan Tyner,
a senior film major, said about the Lunar New
Year skins. “I’m curious to see more historical
twists from the team in the future.”

Lu Bu was a backstabber, having no loyalty to any of his allies and betraying anyone and everyone just to reach his goals. He had such little loyalty, that he even betrayed Liu Bei, the man who established the Shu kingdom, by taking control of the Xuzhou province after Liu Bei offered him shelter there from his enemies. 
Lu Bu’s story could not be closer to Reaper’s
origin story. Reaper started an uprising against
Overwatch and betrayed his best friend Jack
Morrison (soldier 71), who was the head of
Overwatch at the time. Since his betrayal,
Reaper has continued to backstab everyone to
complete his goals.

Lauren Beyer, a freshman graphic design major, admires how the skin caters to the character. “It looks like in terms of representation, they grab the most highlighted feature of [Lu Bu] and put it on [Reaper],” she said. Reaper’s Lu Bu skin is similar to the original look without completely copying it. The skin features Lu Bu’s two-feathered headpiece and the red trimmings on the armor. “You can’t have the actual person as the character, you also have to think of the character you are giving a new skin and making it relevant to them,” Beyer said. 
Another major player the game pays respect to is Guan Yu, one of Liu Bei’s five tiger generals and sworn blood brother. The hero used to portray Guan Yu is the chivalrous Reinhardt, and for good reason. Guan Yu was a warrior whose skill, strength and loyalty made him a legend. Guan Yu was a champion whose honor could not be questioned. His loyalty to Liu Bei held strong even when death was certain.
Andrew Frank, a senior broadcasting major,
connected these two characters. “I don’t want
to say he [Guan Yu] was a monster of a man,
but he definitely got the work done if you know
what I mean,” he said. “It’s not a perfect fit, but
if they were going to pick anyone to represent
Guan Yu, it would be Reinhardt.”

“Reinhardt probably has the biggest heart and the biggest, loudest personality,” Frank said about traits such as the character’s chivalry. “The man is essentially a futuristic knight.” 
Zhang Fei, one of Liu Bei’s five tiger generals is the last of the three sworn blood brothers. The hero used to portray Zhang Fei is the strict and hot headed Torbjorn. Zhang Fei, while bad tempered, was an amazing warrior whose skills could only be compared to Guan Yu. Just as Reinhardt, who plays Guan Yu, can take down many enemies with ease, so can Torbjorn. 
When Liu Bei made a pact with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei to create a better future for China and created a group dedicated to saving the people, so did Torbjorn and Reinhardt. They are two of the six founding members of Overwatch, an organization dedicated to saving the world. Personality-wise, this connection makes sense. Just as Zhang Fei was a brutal man who punished his subordinates for slacking off, so is Torbjorn. The difference is that when Torbjorn punishes his trainees, he does so in a way that shows he cares about them and is only being hard on them to make them stronger; Zhang Fei, on the other hand, abuses them to the point where they can’t take it anymore and they betray him by taking his life.

Melanie Mallios, a senior art major, produces art that challenges the mind. Those who attended the reception for her honors thesis show, The Limbic Lens, in the S.A.L. Gallery on Feb. 21, stepped into a display of her ever- evolving subconscious. 
Mallios began experimenting with art as a young girl, creating unique illustrations and characters inspired by her own imagination. Now 27 years old, her artistic dynamic incorporates the esoteric and profound essence of the 20th century avant-garde movement, surrealism. 
She was inspired by iconic historical figures
such as Salvador Dalí and Sigmund Freud.

Dan Christoffel visited the reception to admire his student’s work. Her work “goes beyond surrealism,” he said. He appreciates her ability to tell a story through her art while simultaneously allowing observers to bring their individual stories into her pieces. “Of all student shows, this is the most varied in terms of techniques, approaches, skills. She has a high level of skill,” Christoffel said. 
Though her art appears philosophical, hidden throughout her paintings, sculptures, print work, and drawings are little amusing details; some added for a metaphorical purpose, according to Mallios, and others simply because she “thought it would be funny.” 
Hanging in one corner of the room was a mockup-caricature drawing of Bob Ross, late painter and host of PBS’ instructional television show, “The Joy of Painting.” Mallios titled the piece “Boobie Ross.” Directly below that piece was her mixed-media rendition of the famous painting, “Madonna of the Lilies.” Etched into the Virgin Mary’s halo of light is the repeated pattern of Pickle Rick, a character from the adult animated science-fiction cartoon, “Rick and Morty.” 
In the opposite corner of the room, focusing more on abstract thought, was a clay sculpture of half man-half statue, inspired by the Greek folk-song, “Agalma,” which means statue in Greek. 
Mallios described the song’s theme. “He [the
singer] talks about how he was in this kind of
city square and with his lover; and there was a
statue there watching them kiss and have fun
and everything. And years later, he comes back
to the statue, and she had cheated on him, so
he goes back to the statue and tells the statue
what happened; and then he saw the statue
crying, and then the statue started comforting
him, and then they parted ways.” Her sculpture
reflects the human element within the statue;
a golden color radiates from below its torso,
implying the existence of a heart. “The statue is
empathizing,” she said.

Complementing each other, were two wood pieces that Mallios was especially proud of. “For some reason drawing on wood feels more intimate,” she said. “It feels closer to nature. You’re scribbling on it, and you can feel it. It just feels more earthy. It’s a good canvas to draw on.” 
One of the wooden pieces portrayed a dog looking up into the sky, who according to Mallios, exists in the “microsphere.” On the second piece, a hawk is flying in the sky looking down over the earth, representing the “macrosphere.” She titled the pieces “Philosophers” be- cause the hawk represents the question of why, and the dog represents the question of what. “One is the offshoot of the other,” she said. 
Victor Zhao, a freshman digital art and design major, is fond of the dark tones in one of the digital prints on display. “It’s really well- drawn,” he said. 
Mallios’ favorite form of art is printmaking. She experiments with monotype prints, which are drawn on plexiglass, and then put into a press to produce a ‘one of a kind’ print. 
Others are made with a zinc plate. With this
type, she etches into the plate with a needle to
create grooves that hold the ink. Because of the
grooves, the plate can be put through the press
several times, therefore, creating more than
one copy of the print, according to the artist.
“You’re basically just making copies that you
can do different things with,” she said. “And
they all have different auras about them de-
pending on the colors you use.”

Mallios plans to study biology after completing her B.F.A. to better prepare for her desired career choice; she wants to be a medical illustrator. The idea came from a former counselor who told her that a friend’s daughter was illustrating diagrams for textbooks, she said. 
But Christoffel believes she can also be an
illustrator for magazines and stories. “She can
play both worlds,” he said. “The big thing is,
she just had it [talent] when she was young;
and here, she has just refined her skills. And
with an imagination like this, there is no better
combination than that.”

We often correlate food with social events and see meal time as a time to relax and wind down. Because relaxing and winding down often entails eating whatever we want, for many, mealtime has become a detrimental calorie overloading event. 
According to Joshua Rosenthal,
the Founder and Director of the
Institution of Integrative Nutrition,
protein directly affects the
sharpness of our minds and
increases alertness. It does this by
increasing the concentration of an
amino acid called Tyrosine.
Tyrosine aides in energy production
and concentration.

If you’re searching for a boost of
energy, you might want to try
adding in some leafy green
vegetables to each meal. Dark green
veggies, such as kale and collard
greens, are rich in chlorophyll
which increases the oxygen carrying
capacity of cells. This makes
exercise and other activities easier
since nutrients are delivered more
efficiently to bodily tissue.

Carbohydrates lead to an
increase in serotonin, which is
responsible for soothing and
calming the body. This makes sense
since many of us often feel lethargic
and relaxed after a big bowl of pasta
or a hearty serving of mashed
potatoes.

Due to the fact that fat requires
more energy by the body to be
broken down it leads to sluggish,
heavy feelings rather than light and
uplifting ones.

Additionally, high density fats
such as those found in meats and
cheeses actually slow down the
digestive process, and this can be
unfavorable if your goal is to shed
those winter pounds that regretfully
make their way to our bellies.

On the flip side, we relate foods
such as salads and protein shakes to
feeling energized and uplifted.

Jennifer Southard, an adjunct English professor, teaches English 1 and 2 and Post 101, and she has a passion for helping students become proficient in writing. Southard holds a Bachelor of Science and a Juris Doctor degree from St. John’s University, along with a Master of Science in English Education from Hofstra University. 
Southard also teaches writing courses at
Adelphi University and Nassau Community
College and volunteers at Literacy Nassau,
where she tutors adults who have learning
disabilities such as dyslexia. Literacy Nassau
is a non-for-profit organization that assists
individuals with low literacy skills. Thanks to
this program, students with financial burdens
receive tutoring services. “I am very passionate
about helping those with dyslexia,” Southard
said.

Southard is working on her certification to
be an Orton Gillingham practitioner, which will
allow her to teach those who struggle in reading
in a multisensory way. “The Academy of Orton
Gillingham Practitioners and Educators is an
institute that promotes and teaches a
methodology which educates individuals with
dyslexia to help them overcome their
disabilities so they can learn to read and write,”
Southard said.

“Literacy Nassau is sponsoring me or giving
me a fellowship to train and become certified in
this program. As part of that, I voluntarily tutor
students in their center in Wantagh,” Southard
added.

With a kind heart and spirit, Southard will
continue to help those in need of literacy skills.
“As far as advice to students, I would say that
many people have a grim outlook on the future
right now, but I truly believe this generation
(meaning my students at Post), has the power
to change things and make the world a much
better place,” Southard said.

This generation, Southard believes, will be able to attain kindness for others, with the technological enhancements available today. “I believe this because this generation knows how to harness the power of social media and displays more compassion and tolerance for others than any generation that I have seen so far,” she said. 
“Be confident in your abilities to change the
world for the better because I truly believe that
you, more than any other generation, has the
power within to do it,” Southard said.

Students may have noticed the camera crews, wires and signs that read “set here” in various spots on campus in the past few weeks. These are all a part of the filming process for an upcoming HBO show, “Mrs. Fletcher” set to premiere in the fall. 
“Mrs. Fletcher” is a comedy about a dual coming-of-age story, exploring the impact of internet porn and social media on the lives of an empty-nest mother (played by Kathryn Hahn) and her college freshman son (played by Jackson White). Filming began Jan. 24, just as spring classes began. 
This isn’t the first time there has been filming on campus. Past TV shows that used locations on campus include “Unbreakable: Kimmy Schmidt,” “My Gay Roommate,” and “Crashing” to name a few. 
Theresa Duggan, director of conference and
guest services, is the main organizer bringing
filming crews to campus. Scouts first come to
campus to take photos of various locations for
the creative teams to visualize scenes. Once
they agree to use the locations, Duggan works
with the crew and the departments of public
safety and facilities services to get an idea of the
scope of the project – how many people will be
involved, how many trucks will be on set, and
how it will impact the day-to-day operations on
campus.

Projects that come to campus pay a rental fee, provide a contract and insurance, and pay for any services that the university offers, according to Duggan. She didn’t want to go into details of the costs, but said she is hopeful the money gets used to help student programs. Duggan could not confirm the funds that benefited from the revenue. 
Chris Fevola, the university chief financial
officer, said the university engages in a series of
auxiliary activities that help to minimize tuition
and fees, including rentals of our space by film
projects.

“The university’s primary focus is providing students with a high-quality, affordable education. Over the past three years, the university’s tuition rate increases have been two percent, at a time when tuition rate increases in our region have been close to four percent,” he said. 
Public safety and facilities services hold an important role when it comes to film projects on campus. Sometimes the project coordinators will hire electricians and public safety aids in setting up the filming crew’s basecamp and blocking off areas for their trucks. 
Some locations being used for filming “Mrs.
Fletcher” this semester are Kumble Hall, the
laundry room and lounge in Post residence hall,
Hillwood Commons, and the library.

“It’s not ideal to use a dorm space that is
occupied, but we are taking great strides to
inform the students working through residence
life and the RAs, slipping flyers under their
doors,” Duggan said in regards to the space in
Post Hall. She said it was only being used for
that weekend until they wrapped up that scene.

Duggan said they do their best not to inconvenience students when filming in a public space like Hillwood Commons, and said the film crews are accommodating to students needs by allowing students to pass through between takes. On Thursday, Feb. 21, the section of Hillwood Commons from the campus concierge to Starbucks and in front of the Gold Coast Cinema was blocked off from 2 p.m. to about 6 p.m. to film a scene. 
Some students enjoy watching the scenes
come to life.

Ashley Damis, a junior broadcasting major, said this type of film work is something she wished she learned in her classes. “It’s different when you’re in the studio and you’re just making up shots with your classmates,” she said. She’d like to be involved with TV shows, movies, or music video production, either as an assistant director or assistant producer, when she graduates. 
Something Damis learned from watching
“Mrs. Fletcher” film is the amount of detail
that goes into each take. “Every detail matters.
I didn’t really pay attention to that when I’m
shooting. [They say] position your hair this
way, wear this that way – I’m really seeing how
tedious that is,” she said.

Duggan said one student is working as an
extra for the show, but did not have any further
information on which student. Duggan tries to
set up opportunities for students to be involved
with film projects on campus, whether it be as
an extra, doing a Q & A with the production
team, or even attending red carpet premieres.

Editor’s Note: The author is a staff reporter
for The Pioneer and a member of the women’s
equestrian team.

For students interested in horseback riding who don’t have the time to join the team, the equestrian club offers the chance to ride horses while still having time for schoolwork. 
The Equestrian Club not only lets students ride horses, but also provides hands-on training in properly taking care of and handling a horse. The club members ride behind the soccer field on the east end of campus at the North Shore Equestrian Center, which houses 25-50 school horses as well as private borders. 
Senior business administration major Elena Leaf, who is the Equestrian Club captain, is pleased to welcome members of all levels. “Any experience is welcomed to join the club. The club has a meeting once a week on Wednesdays to discuss lessons and horse care,” she said. “The fee to joining this club is $350 for newcomers and $300 for returning members.” 
Club members are required to participate the club activities. “We don’t have anything planned yet, but we’re expecting to have a bake sale sometime in the spring,” Leaf said. The event will raise money for grooming supplies for the horses and to help lower fees for members. 
The club hosts horse shows in the fall and spring, where the members “hang out and watch our Post Women’s Equestrian team ride and be there in support for them,” Leaf said. Students in the club are able to participate in shows once the club’s coach feels that they are prepared. Newcomers attend the shows to support the team. 
Suzanne Phillips works at North Shore Equestrian Center and advises the club. “I’ve been teaching at North Shore Equestrian Center for 15 years and I started teaching at the age of 13,” Phillips said. Club members aren’t just getting lessons from an advanced student, but are also being trained by a teacher who builds them into stronger riders with each lesson. 
The club is open to male and female students, whereas the team is currently listed as a women’s sport. “We have lots of new students for next year which are boys,” Phillips said. “That’s the real difference with the club and the team and I think that’s the way it’s going to go.” 
Junior business management major Jiawei Xu has been on the club for a year and a half and enjoys every day. “I was super nervous in the beginning, I had never been on a horse before but I was really excited to try it for the
first time,” Xu said. Since joining the club, his
passion for horses has grown.

“I enjoyed my lessons with Suzy [Phillips] so much, that I ended up doing private lessons with her, and now I ride every day,” he said. “I never enjoyed any other sports and I always prefer being around animals. Three years ago, I never thought I would be riding horses, but here I am,” Xu said. 
“Wednesday is club day; we ride with our coach Suzy, for an hour in the evenings once a week,” Leaf said. If you’ve never ridden before and want to join the club, the best advice you can get from the coach is, “Think spring. Beginners need to be outside, my heart can’t take beginners in the indoor ring,” Phillips said. Riding outdoors gives new students a lot more space to maneuver if they don’t yet know how to steer.

On Jan. 14, HEOP (Higher Education Opportunity Program) students were informed by email about their present and future, moving forward without William Clyde, the director of the HEOP program on campus for almost 38 years. Clyde left the university in January and is now the EOP (Educational Opportunity Program) director at Nassau Community College. The HEOP director from the LIU Brooklyn campus will come to campus one day a week to oversee the remaining students. 
In a letter to HEOP students, Clyde wrote: “I ask this of you now and moving ahead—continue to be steadfast, focused and diligent in the pursuit to complete your education. HEOP at its best reflects the substance of the internal fortitude, grit and perseverance of students who do not accept mediocrity in their pursuit of excellence. It is my sincere hope and prayer that each of you will continue to strive to become the best version of yourself.” 
The unexpected announcement left HEOP
students with mixed emotions. What will be
their next moves?

Ingrid Jimenez, a sophomore health science
major, hopes to be accepted into the radiology
program. Although she was shocked about the
news of Mr. Clyde leaving, she believes this this
will ultimately motivate her to do much better.

“The HEOP scholarship is what allows me
to be a student still on this campus; without
the financial assistance, I wouldn’t be here”
Jimenez said. She will be keeping the financial
assistance HEOP gives her.

Jimenez believes that without the assistance she gets, especially for books and supplies for her program, she would not be able to receive the same opportunities other students have. Although there is the assumption that students receive “a full ride” with the HEOP scholarship, she stated that, “just like others students, I’m paying a balancing on my tuition.” Although HEOP grants students help with their tuition, students still have to pay the remaining balance.  
Jimenez’s first choice during high school
was to attend Nassau Community College.
However, she ultimately chose LIU Post when
she was accepted with HEOP on her side. She
strongly believes that the program benefits
those who are not financially ready for college.
“HEOP helps people from middle to lower class
to attend schools like this one,” she said.

“I think if HEOP was erased completely, I think it would suck because without it, there are a lot of intelligent students who may not get the chance to go college or any university because they may not have the finances to do so; this is what HEOP has helped all of us with,” Jimenez added. 
Jimenez plans to stay at Post, despite the
changes. “I was really shocked that Clyde left
and I’ve spoken to his replacement and he’s
also helpful too; I was just so used to being
comfortable by being able to come to Mr. Clyde
with any issues or problems that I was dealing
with and it’s sad,” Jimenez said.

Nyjaya Pyatt, a sophomore psychology major, plans to return for the fall 2019 semester as well, although she said that she would consider transferring since the changes were implemented. 
“The reason why I would transfer is because I feel like HEOP is not the same since my freshman year experience. I remember all the stories that I’ve heard about HEOP, when I heard it was fun and now it seems like no one, even the administration, doesn’t want HEOP around,” Pyatt said. 
Pyatt said that she would go to another school if it gave her the financial opportunity like HEOP does. “HEOP is just not how it used to be; there was a lot of running around and changes for us from us not having tutors, from our location moving one place to another, it seemed like a lot of drama,” Pyatt said. 
Like Jimenez, Pyatt is disappointed that Clyde is no longer at LIU. “When I found out Mr. Clyde was leaving, I was actually really sad; it was hard for me to go through the email without crying, I felt like he really cared about us and he wanted the best for us, even though some students felt like he was hard and snappy on us, but he really cared for us in a different way than the administration here does; he made sure we reached our potential when life got so tough on us,” Pyatt said. 
Pyatt believes that the LIU administration
treats HEOP students differently from other
students and that the “labeling” should stop.

“The fact that we are in HEOP and we don’t
get success coaches like regular students have
says something about this school,” Pyatt said.
“Every other person, even honors students,
athletic students, have success coaches but we
don’t.” Although Pyatt plans to stay at Post, she
is still questioning whether she should transfer.

Angelina Lynch, psychology major, plans to transfer for fall 2019 because Post does not offer the program that she initially wanted. Although she said that HEOP has nothing to do with her plans, she thinks the program is not going to help the way it did when Clyde was on campus. 
“I don’t think it will help the way it did without Clyde on the support level; he was always there to listen and give advice; now we have no one,” she said. 
The HEOP program, Lynch said, “has helped me financially. Without HEOP, I probably would have not gone to school due to not being able to afford it and I believe it helps and will help people in the same position.” 
“It’s sad to see Clyde go, and I miss him
dearly; he was great and very helpful, he was
there for everyone at anytime but I am happy
for him moving up; does it hurt HEOP that he
left? Yes, but it is what it is,” Lynch said.

Steve Israel, director of the LIU Global Institute and former U.S. Congressman, will leave LIU to start a new chapter at Cornell University. Israel will assume the position of the inaugural director of the Cornell Institute of Politics and Global Affairs, in the 2019-20 academic year. 
Israel started the LIU Global
Institute in fall 2016, with the goal
to engage students with national
leaders like Presidents Bill Clinton
and George W. Bush, and to
discuss national affairs.

At Cornell, Israel will “build
connections among stakeholders
in domestic and global politics,
including political leaders, policy
think tanks, the business
community, international civil
society and academia,” Michael
Kotlikoff, Cornell Provost, told
the Cornell Chronicle, the Cornell
student newspaper, in its Jan. 31
article “Institute of Politics and
Global Affairs to Open at Cornell.”

The Cornell institute will have offices in metro New York, although Israel will teach one class in Ithaca in the fall, according to the Cornell Chronicle article. A faculty director will be appointed on the Ithaca campus to coordinate campus participation in programming, including a faculty and student fellows program, according to Wendy Wolford, vice provost for international affairs at Cornell, the article said. 
In an email announcement on Feb. 1, university president Kimberly Cline wrote, “We are excited about our continued local partnership with Cornell University and Congressman Israel to expand on important dialogue and research about public affairs and the world. 
LIU will partner with the Cornell Institute of Politics and Global Affairs, including hosting and co-branding events on Long Island. This partnership will continue to engage our students and the broader community.” 
While LIU will co-sponsor Long
Island events, all events hosted at
Cornell’s NYC and Ithaca
campuses will be solely sponsored
by Cornell, according to Israel.

“I loved my time at LIU, but it’s not coming to a definitive end,” Israel said. Israel will present a series of Hutton House Lectures on campus this spring, including
“Inside Congress” on March 19,
“Global Challenges” on April 23,
and “Common Ground” on May 14.
The Global Institute, like Hutton
House, will become part of the new
School of Professional Studies.

The Hutton House lectures are for
retired members of neighboring
communities wishing to further
their education.

“Like many Hutton House
lecturers, the former Congressman
will inform and engage our
students in subject matter in
which he is considered a thought
leader. His insights are informed
by 16 years of experience in
Congress,” said Rita Langdon,
dean of the school of professional
studies.

According to Langdon, the university’s chief talent officer, Denise Dick, will oversee the search for a new director of the Global Institute. 
“The ideal candidate for directorship will be a thought leader and highly accomplished individual fluent in global affairs,” Langdon said. 
A position announcement with candidate criteria will soon be available on the LIU website, according to Langdon, and members of the LIU community are encouraged to refer candidates. 
Israel will continue as a member of the LIU board of trustees. His official papers from his 16 years in Congress will remain archived at Post. Israel said he will have an important role in sponsoring events for the Theodore Roosevelt Institute on Sagamore Hill as a board member of the association and a member of the Roosevelt Legacy group.

The Dean’s Advisory Council is a new student body that is part of a “large student engagement initiative” led by Dean of Students Michael Berthel. 
The council consists of seven undergraduate and graduate students who were recommended to Berthel by their success coaches and enrollment service counselors because they are involved in various aspects of student life on campus, such as athletics or Greek Life. Alyssa Curzio, JP Cruz, Gianni Niamani Theobbles, Kendall Purdy, Maxwell Cohen, Louis Copertino, and Michael Licata make up the council. 
Berthel will look to the advisory
council for feedback on how to better
student life on campus. He meets with
his advisory council once to twice a
month, and they discuss a different
topic at each meeting, including ideas
for future plans on campus, what is
currently working well for students, and
what could be improved for students.
The goal is to ensure that students have
a positive experience on campus.

“I firmly believe that a dean of students should be constantly hearing directly from students, and through all of my initiatives this semester, I plan on doing just that,” Berthel said. 
His advisory council will tie together the “Ask the Dean” events and his new “Lunch with the Dean” series. At both “Ask the Dean” and “Lunch with the Dean” Berthel said he will get feedback about different aspects of student life from different students. Once he gets this feedback, he will meet with his advisory council, and discuss how to incorporate that feedback to enhance life on campus for students. 
Students can expect to see more of the “You Asked, We Listened” emails coming out this semester, Berthel said. “These emails are a direct result of feedback from my student engagement programs and the Deans Advisory Council. Relaunching the End Zone was a suggestion from the council and we have already made quick changes at their suggestion,” he said. 
“I am loving these new programs, interacting with students is the best part of my job,” Berthel said. 
Berthel hopes that students will continue to connect with him his
through his Instagram page @DeanBerthel_LIU. “This is all about
reaching students and I am going to keep at it until I reach everyone.”

The Student Government Association (SGA) underwent a leadership change at the beginning of the spring 2019 semester. Olivia Kavanaugh, senior art education major, stepped down as president and assumed the vice president role. Erica Ferrara, senior geology and environmental sustainability major and the former SGA vice president, was voted to replace her. The vote to switch the roles was made by the SGA senate members. 
Kavanaugh said she stepped down because she could not completely devote her time to SGA. “With student teaching, I do not even have access to my phone until about 3 p.m. every day. I felt that that was unfair to my senators, my e-board and the student body that the student leading them wasn’t even able to be present or accessible until late in the day,” she said. 
Kavanaugh will do more “behind the scenes” work as vice president, a role she held during the 2017-2018 academic year. 
“I have no doubt she’ll put her everything into being SGA President,” Kavanaugh said about Ferrara, saying that she is “very reliable.” 
Ferrara was voted into the position as president by the senators. Her new responsibilities include overseeing the Senate and working with the e-board to come up with a sustainable action plan for the semester. The President and Vice President work closely with one another and with the administration. 
Ferrara said there are many events lined up
for the spring. There will be a Town Hall on
March 26 in the Krasnoff Theater with a panel
of representatives from athletics, LIU Promise,
Kumble Hall, Aramark, and public safety. They
will also hold a networking lunch for student
organizations to encourage collaboration and
celebrate their successes over the last year.

SGA will also conduct a survey that gauges the opinions of students on various areas of the university with questions regarding academics, administration, campus safety, infrastructure, food quality, Title IX issues, and faculty and staff. Ferrara said the survey will help SGA formulate goals for the next academic year and help communicate with the appropriate administrative parties on specific issues affecting the student body. 
SGA is also working on creating a student guidebook with tips and up to date department information. “This guidebook is still in the works and will contain key resources and contact information as well as fun and informative tips (from students) for living on campus, and getting involved as a commuter,” Ferrara said. There is no estimated release date for the guidebook. 
The March 26 Town Hall will be the first SGA event this semester, though events regarding student engagement and feedback such as the “Ask the Dean” series, have already been organized by Dean of Students Michael Berthel and his newly created Dean’s Advisory Council. The Dean’s Advisory Council, a body composed of seven students selected by Berthel, after recommendations from success coaches and enrollment advisors, gives Berthel feedback on how to better student life on campus. 
SGA, which is a governing body elected by students, is not affiliated with the Dean’s Council, according to Ferrara. “We have not, as of yet, been super involved in this initiative,” she said. 
Berthel has worked with SGA in the past to coordinate town halls, meetings and events with members of the Division of Student Life, which includes Enrollment Services, LIU Promise, Conference and Guest Services, Center for Healthy Living, and the Learning Support Center. “I congratulate Erica on her new leadership role and wish her the best of luck as President. My door is always open for SGA to discuss how I can support their efforts. I look forward to working with Erica and the SGA on issues that are important to students,” Berthel said. 
SGA meets every Wednesday at 5 p.m. in
Hillwood Commons room 121. Students are
welcome to attend meetings and to share their
ideas or concerns.
