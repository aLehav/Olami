Dear Readers,
As our nation was in trouble due to an enormous oil spill that occurred last April, our campus newspaper was also knee deep in muck.  Through an abundance of obstacles and tremendous help (props to Professor Carolyn Levin) we have managed to reinvent this publication. This edition is the first full version of the Pioneer and is solid proof that, just like BP cemented it’s own spill, we too have put a halt to the Pioneer’s chaos.
As promised we have delivered a brand new installation of news, sports, opinion, arts and entertainment.  To begin the news, our campus television studio had a grand re-opening, likewise, Post’s International Student Union (ISU) was brought back.  Learn how to utilize our very own library in ways you never thought possible.  The opinions just keep coming, ranging from how to manage your time to which major you should choose and why.  Our features section is jam-packed with spotlights on notable students, and a brand new nutrition column that will be included in each issue.  The former revue part of the paper is now a review of the arts and entertainment presented by the staff of Loomings.  And to finally top off the last of the cement filling, our sports staff has reported the latest news on your fall athletic teams.
We genuinely hope you enjoy this full edition, now get reading.

Women’s Volleyball
By: Brian Starkman
The women’s volleyball team at C.W. Post continues to rack up wins going undefeated in three matches against NE-10 teams on their two day road trip in Massachusetts.
Friday night they had their first game at Merrimack College. Led by a superb effort from freshman outside hitter, Jordan Schroer who recorded her first career double-double with 11 kills and 11 digs. Leading the offense with 14 kills was freshman outside hitter, Maka Namahoe who was helped by senior Amanda Ostapow, who led the team with 40 assists.
The defense also played extremely well as Post holding back the Warriors attack with 62 digs. Freshman libero, Stephanie Coufal, led the Pioneers with 25 digs while again, Namahoe had five blocks and Schroer blocking four helped the Pioneers to beat Merrimack 3-1.
Saturday the girls traveled to Bentley University where they squared off against both the Falcons (Bentley) and UMass Lowell and completed their sweep, however they were hard fought games.
In the first set of matches, Namahoe again came out strong leading the Pioneers with 11 kills in the first match along with 4 service aces and 7 digs. She was assisted again by Ostapow who led the team with 34 helpers. Senior outside hitter, Marilena Guadagnini contributed as well, totaling 8 kills and 13 digs, overcoming the Falcons 3-1.
The second match against UMass Lowell allowed Namahoe and Guadagunini to shine again as both recorded a double-double. Guadagnini led Post with 17 kills and 4 aces. Namahoe cushioned her stats adding 12 kills and digs respectively. Ostapow also registered a double-double assisting 46 times and 10 digs.
Finishing up the weekend at home against Le Moyne College the Pioneers came out strong in the first two sets only to hold off a Dolphins comeback to win the match 3-2. Seniors Guadagnini (12 kills/16 digs) and Ostapow (53 assists/10 digs) had another brilliant game, each posting a double-double. However, sophomore outside hitter Geony Fisher would lead the team with a total of 19 kills.
The Pioneers’ record now stands at 10-3 with the girls back in action against the East Coast Conference when they visit Molloy Wednesday.
