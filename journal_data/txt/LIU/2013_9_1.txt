Olivia Wicik, the Pioneer’s Editor-in-Chief from 2012-2013, is currently a desk associate at CBS Radio News, where she gets to assist award-winning journalists on a daily basis. She says that ever since starting the job she has learned something new every day. One of the best parts of working at CBS Radio is being in a newsroom when breaking news is happening.
“What I love about journalism is that everyone I’ve met in the field is so passionate about it. Waking up in the middle of the night for work can get exhausting for some people, but it doesn’t even feel like work to me! I feel lucky to be doing what I’m doing.”
If she has one piece of advice for current Post students it’s: Network, network, network! “I smile and say hello to everyone I come in contact with at CBS…you never know who you will meet!”
Being a part of the Pioneer during college gave Olivia the motivation to one day become a successful journalist. It was an amazing experience!
