The College of Arts, Communications, and Design is searching for a new dean to replace former Dean Noel Zahler, who left the university in August 2016, after four years in the position. Christine Kerr, a professor in the art department and the director of the art therapy program, has been acting as the interim dean of CACD since Zahler left.
The CACD search committee, composed of professors and administrators, has chosen four finalists for the permanent dean position. The four final candidates have visited campus over the past several weeks to interview and meet with faculty, students and administrators.
The candidates, Jeff Bellantoni, vice president of academic affairs at Ringling College of Art and Design; Steven Breese, Dean of Arts and Sciences at Southern Connecticut State University; Richard Karpen, Director of the School of Music at the University of Washington; and Christine Kerr, Interim Dean of CACD, professor in the art department and director of art therapy program at LIU Post, met with students to answer questions about some of the core issues students see within their programs.
At the student sessions, multiple students voiced concerns about accessibility, specifically pointing fingers at the Post academic advisors, or Promise Coaches, that place non-major students into the classes for major students.
“Their job is to know their students and know what to put them in,” Steven Breese said. “[I would] screen classes and boot out those who don’t need it.” Breese, if selected, would repair the lack of communication between advisors and specific colleges.
Another issue students raised is funding, or lack thereof, for mandatory programs and events such as dance performances, Broadway shows, and art exhibits. Even with student-organized fundraisers, students are still “paying out of pocket” an estimated extra $400, participants at the forums said.
Breese promised to find other ways to fund programs. Richard Karpen, however, said that he would take a different approach. “If there is not enough money to do everything, [then] we shouldn’t be doing everything,” Karpen said. Instead of spreading the opportunities thin, more attention, he said, should be paid to more important areas.
Students raised the issue of scholarship funding for upperclassmen, saying that they are scarce. Most of the money goes into recruitment for incoming freshmen, students said.
Bellantoni proposed a solution. If selected for the position, Bellantoni will attempt to secure a private donor and fundraise for grants and scholarships, rather than “pull from an existing budget that is already tight.”
A number of the buildings and facilities used by CACD students are old and outdated, students said. According the theater and music majors, the Little Theater and Fine Arts buildings have mold, pests, and heating problems. “There’s a list,” Kerr responded. “You have to make a wish list and a reality list and then take from what’s in between,” Kerr said. There is a plan to make the buildings more “open and user friendly’ by reconstructing the insides, she said.
Students in the art department raised the issue of the Steinberg Museum of Art, which relocated from Hillwood Commons to the basement of the library when the bookstore moved into its old space before the fall 2016 semester. Susan Kelly, Laura Sweeney, and Samantha Hofsiss, graduate students in fine arts, expressed their dissatisfaction with the move. “There is no space, [the space] is unfit, and the walls need to be painted a different color than orange,” Kelly said.
“Tell me what you need,” Kerr said. Kerr, who has been a professor at LIU Post for over 17 years, is confident that if given the position, she can get things done. “You just have to keep reminding them that you’re here,” she said.
Despite the considerable amount of issues students raised with the CACD dean candidates, they agreed that in each department, the faculty are the strongest points in keeping the balance between the pros and cons. Students were interested in how the Dean can make the arts at Post larger, but maintain the quality of the existing staff.
“[We have to] add faculty and add facilities to create a more diverse learning experience,” Breese said. There needs to be a balanced ratio between faculty and students. With a background as an actor, Breese explained that a “healthy competitiveness” is necessary to grow as actors, dancers, and artists.
Karpen, a composer who has taught artists of all genres, proposed students take a more “experimental” approach to expand the arts. Bellantoni agreed, advocating for students to feel “immersed in the arts,” by getting different departments to interact with one another.
The College of Arts, Communications, and Design students were pleased to have the opportunity to be heard and address their concerns with the prospective dean candidates. At each presentation, they stressed how important it is to let students be heard.

FiOS1 morning news anchor Christine Persichette spoke in the JOU 4 Beat Reporting class about her career as a television journalist, including her current position as a morning news anchor for FiOS1 News on Thursday, Feb. 17. Persichette offered her advice to the class of young, aspiring journalists. “It’s so important to love what you do,” she said.
Persichette has been the morning anchor at FiOS1 News since 2015. “I never thought being an anchor was what I wanted to do,” she said, but she loves what she does now. And that love has given Persichette opportunities to do things like have a sit-down interview with Hillary Clinton, and attend several of Donald Trump’s press conferences.
Throughout her career, she hasn’t stopped working hard. In her current position, she goes to work in the early morning, and gets out of work at 10 a.m. every day. This allows her to spend time with her three young children, two of whom are in kindergarten.
Persichette’s first position at FiOS1 was hosting a show called “Heroes on Our Island,” about people doing good things in the community. She said it was “great” to do that show. “You want to tell people good things that are happening,” she said. “That’s why you get into this business.” She showed clips from “Heroes on Our Island” to the journalism students.
But of course, she reminded them, not everything in journalism is a positive story. “There are some uncomfortable things,” she said.
You can’t let it affect you, but it does.” However, that’s not always bad. She explained that showing feelings towards the person you’re interviewing shows a more human side, and can actually get them to open up more Persichette advised the students that finding the “little nuggets” is the key to making boring stories interesting. “You can make any story interesting,” she said. “There are no boring stories, only boring reporters.”
She also emphasized the need for journalists to research and find contacts, as gaining certain contacts can lead to gaining other connections.
Persichette said journalists need to “know their story,” because people will ask questions, and the ability to “think on your feet” is important. Persichette spoke about the importance of internships in college, saying that they are “the best thing you can do” to gain skills and experience.
Persichette grew up in Queens, earned her bachelor’s degree in communications at SUNY Albany, and her master’s degree in broadcast journalism at NYIT. Following her graduation, she began her first job as a TV news reporter and anchor in the small town of Elmira, New York. This is where Persichette’s work ethic shined. Since it was a small television market, she was what she described as a “one-man band.” She reported, researched, shot, and edited her stories all by herself. “Knowing how to do everything is a requirement these days,” she said.
Persichette advanced at the Elmira station, eventually becoming the executive producer. She moved on to work at Fox as a TV news reporter from 2003 through 2013. Shortly after, she obtained her first position at FiOS1.
Next fall, Persichette’s work will extend beyond the reporting world, and into the classroom. She will be teaching the JOU 5 class, “Writing for Electonic Media” at LIU Post.

On Nov. 3, 2016, LIU President Dr. Kimberly Cline announced the formation of a new school marching band. Recruitment and plans are now underway. Set to begin performing in fall 2017, the LIU Post Marching Band will be led by experienced marching band leader, Anthony Romeo.
“Mr. Romeo has more than 25 years of experience leading and working with marching bands on Long Island, including the New York Skyliners, the Holbrook Fire Department Drum Band, and the “Rage” Indoor Marching Percussion Ensemble, in addition to high school ensembles throughout Nassau and Suffolk Counties,” Cline said in the November statement.
The marching band will be a new club under the auspices of the office of campus life. It will be separate from the existing student pep band in the Department of Music. It will serve to amplify team spirit and enhance the game day experience for the Post Pioneer’s lacrosse team and football team, according to Dean of Students Abigail Van Vlerah. “This program will be funded by the University and the cost of the program will be dependent upon student participation,” Van Vlerah said.
Cheerleading coach and Promise Success Coach Katelin Townsend is “very excited to have a marching band come to LIU Post.” She added, “I truly believe that this will change the atmosphere of game day.” Townsend said that the new marching band could amp up the atmosphere for other teams as well as enhance her own team’s performances. “I always enjoyed dancing along to the band’s songs and chants. It helped us [as cheerleaders] to hype up the crowd and get the players ready to roll!”
Director of Music Education and Chair of the Music Department, Dr. Jennifer Miceli, as well as Music Professor and Director of Bands, Dr. James W. McRoy said that they could not comment about the marching band as it will not be a part of the Music Department. Romeo did not respond to the Pioneer’s requests for comment.

Following the departure of Patricia Seaman Summer 2016, former director of study abroad and academic standing, there has been uncertainty among students about the study abroad program . As a student who plans to go to France this summer, I had no idea who to go to or where to start.
I set up my very first study abroad appointment last semester with Natasha Vaughn (‘16), who had applied for the job as temporary study abroad director and academic standing coordinator after working there as a student worker for four years. We met up in the study abroad office located in Winnick Mansion, and scrutinized my options with regard to my major, core class fulfillment, and desires. Seaman had previously sat with students to explain their options and check their credits.
Vaughn left later that semester to start a new job. The study abroad office was empty for multiple weeks. After revisiting of the office constantly, confused about where I stood in my study abroad process, I was introduced to Kaitlin Jensen. Jensen was presented to me as the new director of study abroad and academic standing coordinator late fall 2016. Jensen has also been an LIU promise coach.
Weeks after meeting Jensen, I decided to visit the study abroad office to further my process. However, I found a sign on the door stating that all study abroad inquiries were to go to the promise coaches. I immediately set up a meeting with my promise coach to once again begin my study abroad process.
The promise coaches are now in charge of providing the students with study abroad information. The promise office on the second floor of Hillwood Commons advises students to look into affiliated programs, particularly faculty-led study abroad programs. Currently, if a student is interested in studying abroad through a non-afilliate, they will have to do the research and application on their own, according to the promise coach I met with Diana Vsky (‘16), worked as a work-study in the study abroad office for four years. Her experience working with Seaman was different. “It didn’t matter if it [the program] was afilliated or non-afilliated, it had to do more with preference,” she said when describing the previous study abroad process.
After meeting with my promise coach, the next step was to contact Dean of Students, Abagail Van Vlerah. After emailing her secretary to schedule an appointment, I was redirected to Kaitlin Bathrick, a success coach assisting Van Vlerah with the study abroad process.
Unfortunately, the only faculty-led study abroad program I was interested in, Black Paris, Choosing Exile led by Deborah Mutnick and Ellen Short, was cancelled due to low enrollment. Therefore, I decided to go for a non-afilliated program Vsky had advised me was as a popular one. Upon meeting with Bathrick, she was able to better guide me on paperwork that needed to be filled out and what the new process looks like.
According to Bathrick, the study abroad process now consists of three steps. First, students need to meet with their success coaches. They are the ones who will provide information on strictly afilliated programs. If the student is interested in a non-afilliated program, they have to do the research on their own. Thereafter, the students will be directed to Kaitlin Bathrick, who will guide students in the right direction as far as paperwork and credits go. Lastly, Van Vlerah receives and looks over the applications.
The study abroad process is no longer administered by a single person, according to Van Vlerah. “Our success coaches, as well as Kaity Bathrick and myself, as the dean of students, are taking the lead in informing students on what is available, how to get the ball rolling and how to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Van Vlerah declined to answer questions in person or over the phone. She would only reply to the Pioneer’s inquiries through email.
Bathrick now sets up information sessions with affiliated and non- affiliated programs. The first information session took place Feb. 15 for students interested in the non-afilliated center for international studies program (CIS), led by a CIS representative. A faculty-led study abroad information session was held on Feb. 16. There will be another information session set up for March 6 at 12:30 pm, in Hillwood Commons room 221, with the affiliated program at Regents University London.
According to Van Vlerah, affiliated study abroad programs include, “University of Cambridge in England, Fudan University in China, Regents University in London, Södertön University in Sweden.” Van Vlerah did not respond to why Jensen is no longer the director of study abroad.

Assistant Professor Shawn Welnak of the philosophy department in his office at Winnick House. Welnak is uncovering an answer to the question, “What is liberal education?” and how is it related to the human being, the city, political life, and the cosmos?
The Pioneer (TP): Where do you hope to go with your work on what liberal education is, in terms of creating something specific and in terms of trying to gain more insight on the question?
Shawn Welnak (SW): I hope to help recover an older, pre-Enlightenment view of liberal education and do my part in re-establishing establishing that view in academia.
TP: What is that better view?
SW: The life of the mind is higher than the life of action.
TP: At what moment did you discover your love of philosophy?
SW: That would be my fifth semester in college.
TP: Why were you attracted to philosophy?
SW: It was the only field that attempted to ask “Why” about everything. My philosophy teacher was the first professor who when I asked, “Why I should I bother learning about it?” tried to give me an answer. To him it was a worthy question.
TP: What was the first philosophy book you read?
SW: The first thing that attracted me was Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan.
TP: Why that book?
SW: Because he seemed to understand what everyone in their idealism ignored: the self-interested character of man. Like everyone around—professors, society, people in general. It was one of the first books I read in philosophy.
Welnak also shared an admiration for Aristotle, who, he said, shares with Hobbes “the same understanding of man as a self-interested being,” but offers a more hopeful route for mankind, “That it could transcend itself into love of friends. He solves the problems that Hobbes takes up about man’s self-interested character with friendship.”
TP: What do you think can be learned from philosophy?
SW: Self-knowledge. Humility. What they don’t know. Awareness of the limits of knowledge.
TP: What do you think is the main problem in society?
SW: Globalism. The idea of world government, and the loss of understanding of citizenship. “Global citizen” is a contradiction in terms.
TP: What are you concerned is the greatest problem among students?
SW: The lack of wonder in, and their souls. This is a critique of modernity, ultimately. The Enlightenment, insofar as it told us we could radically think for ourselves has brought us deeper into the cave, that is to say, we have become less aware of our ignorance.
“Our certitude,” Welnak said, “is our greatest problem. Thinking we know what we don’t know is the problem the West faces.”
TP: What book do you recommend that most people don’t know of, or don’t often read?
SW: The Nichomachean Ethics, the most important book ever written.
TP: What advice do you have for students who want to be better learners?
SW: I think that anytime we disagree with an author of the greatest caliber, we need to assume that we are wrong, not them. We ought to assume that they are right, and we are wrong, and learn how they are right, and try to understand how we could be wrong.

Senior dance major Rhaamell Burke-Missouri is proof that you don’t have to find your passion at a young age in order to succeed. Burke-Missouri did not start dancing until the age of 19, but has been in love with it ever since. Now at the age of 23, Burke-Missouri took the Fall 2016 semester off to go on a Broadway tour that would change his life forever.
 
Born in Queens, NY and raised in Queens and Holy Spring, North Carolina, Burke-Missouri had no idea what he wanted to spend his life doing at an early age. In high school, he became interested in dance and began to learn the basics. Burke-Missouri then started his journey, in the dance program where he discovered that dance truly is his passion. “It wasn’t always a passion because I thought it was really weird for a man to love dance. So it took me doing it after high school to see how truly passionate I am about dance,”       Burke-Missouri said.
With a desire to return to New York, Burke-Missouri joined the program in 2013. Admissions told         Burke-Missouri something before he attended the university that really caught his eye. “They told me flat-out that my technique wasn’t where it needed to be for a professional career, but the passion I danced with made them see so much in me. That is what made me come here. They told me that they would mold me into something great and so far, they have,” Burke-Missouri said. He takes classes in ballet, jazz, modern dance, tap dance, African dance, and hip-hop. Some students feel that dance is not an “actual major,” but Burke-Missouri ignores all negative comments that he receives. “I know it’s a major and it is something that I will be doing for the rest of my life, so I look at them and show that dance is not only a major but a fun and enjoyable career choice.” Burke-Missouri believes that the university has helped his career tremendously. “Post allowed me to go out and learn more about dance. I started taking class in the city and meeting so many people in the dance world through that. I can honestly say that the professors here at Post allowed the drive and determination that was already in me to flourish into something strong.”
In summer 2016, Burke-Missouri received his first professional theatre contract. He was a featured dancer in a summer season at Woodstock Playhouse, and soon after that, he signed a second contract to go on a Broadway tour.
In Burke-Missouri’s Fall 2016 semester, he decided to go on tour with the show Cinderella across America and Canada. In order to do so, Burke-Missouri woke up at 6 a.m. and made his way into Manhattan for an audition. Afterwards, he attended callback after callback and sent in dance videos whenever needed.   Burke-Missouri always wanted to be on Broadway, and in order to do so, he was told he would have to become a “triple threat.” Burke-Missouri began singing and acting alongside dance. “When I came to college, I literally did everything that I could to learn more about what it took to get to Broadway. So that means taking voice lessons, taking as many acting classes and of course, dancing until my legs fall off,” Burke-Missouri said.
While on the Broadway tour, Burke-Missouri was a swing, or an understudy for all male ensemble parts. On the tour, he understudied 6 1/2 parts. “I would rehearse a different part of the show EVERY night because my job was to be ready to go on stage at a drop of a hat and do the show as if nothing was wrong and as if I did the show every night with the cast. When I got the offer, I was told that it was the HARDEST job in theatre. Now I know that to be true.”
Burke-Missouri said it feels different to be back at Post after taking off a semester. “I got to go out in the world and do the thing that I learn about every day here at Post.” Being in Cinderella changed the way he looks at his education. “Being a swing is hard and it was only my second job when it comes to theatre, so I had a lot of learning to do on the tour. Now that I am back, I get to have the opportunity to get that knowledge without the stress of having to get out on stage and be a part of a big production like Cinderella,” Burke-Missouri said. Being back at Post allows him to “fine tune” his skills and make him a better dancer in order to get him where he wants to be.
Burke-Missouri wants to graduate from college before making any other big plans, such as a national tour. “My second near-future goal is to go out into the world and learn as much as I can about what I do to make me an even more well-rounded person. When it comes to my dreams, I got to do that when I was on tour.” Burke-Missouri believes he is already living out his dreams and has finally found his voice in the world of theatre. “Now I know my worth and talent; in my eyes, that’s a dream come true.”

Juggling classes, homework, extracurricular activities and an active social life can be stressful for college students. Eating healthy foods is probably the last thing on your mind, but choosing healthy options is important for so many reasons.
The campus nutritionists, graduate students working as dietetic interns in the department of nutrition in the School of Health Professions and Nursing, communicate with Aramark, the outside food service that provides the food in the Winnick dining hall, in an effort to ensure that healthy options are available to students. The nutritionists offer student suggestions and concerns regularly to Aramark’s Operations Manager, Brian Yoli, and Executive Chef Justin Poly. “Aramark runs the majority of food operations on campus including Winnick Hall, Hillwood Cafe, Starbucks, End Zone, Bleaker Street, Twisted Taco, Subway, Ocelott, Little Shop at Winnick and Campus Catering,” Yoli said. In doing so, Aramark works closely with the nutrition and sustainability group on campus.
According to the three graduate student nutritionists, Stephanie Schmidt, Melissa Fine and Emily Ranucci, “Winnick makes an effort to provide healthy options from oatmeal and veggie egg white omelettes for breakfast to grilled or baked protein with a side of brown rice or whole wheat pasta and steamed veggies at lunch and dinner. Their salad bar is also available daily and quite impressive.”
The nutritionists have also been featuring healthier menu items available at Winnick on their Instagram page (sensible_bites) to give students an idea as to how to build a healthy plate while dining on campus.
On Wednesdays and Thursdays from March 8 to April 5, the nutritionists will host nutrition informational tables at Winnick and Hillwood during common hour. The information tables for National Nutrition Month will each have their own theme such as “Fuel Your Workout, Plan Your Plate, Facts on Fiber and Fact or Quack\Nutrition Trivia.” They will be there offering nutrition information, interactive games and prizes. The nutrition club may also assist them with the tables as well.
“We have many students with special diets and allergies to certain foods. It is great that we can partner up, and really set up a great plan and balanced diet for these students. I hope the students (both residential and commuter students) can join us for national nutrition month,” Yoli said.
Here are a few tips provided by the nutritionists for maintaining a healthy diet:
1) Try keeping instant oatmeal, high fiber cereal, protein bar and/or fresh fruit in your dorm room or backpack when you don’t have time to sit for a meal.
2) When making a plate of food, fill 1/2 with fruits and vegetables, 1/4 with a lean protein (eggs/ egg whites, fish or poultry) and the other 1/4 with whole grains (brown rice, barley, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta).
3) Students can be creative with the different food stations in Winnick by filling their plate with colorful goodies found at the salad bar then adding in hot protein from the “home zone” station.
The three nutritionists suggested visiting MyPlate.gov for additional information regarding nutrition. Students can schedule a free appointment with a campus nutritionist at 516-299-2881 or                     post-nutritionist@liu.edu.
The nutritionists are located in the Life Science building, room 150, on Tuesdays through Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Senior theater major Daniel George has been preparing his senior thesis for over a year, receiving some help along the way from advisors and professors to keep him on-task. The senior thesis, for theater majors, is not a lengthy essay, but rather a performance. Although he has only been rehearsing his performance for a week and a half, George “certainly feels the weight of the year-long process.”
George’s thesis performance will feature a “devised theater piece” which means that the “story and characters are created out of a specific kind of physical theatre and the dialogue is [pulled from other works].” George has compiled sections of Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett and merged them into “one cohesive play.” Each character in the play has his or her own unique way of appearing on stage. The goal is to correlate the “physical life” (person on stage) with the text. “It’s an intellectually challenging process, but I find it brings out really beautiful and provocative theatre,” George said.
The creation of the thesis may be a difficult and long task to achieve, but the acting process is what George enjoys the most. He doesn’t feel pressure like one might when being graded on test answers, per se. George explains, “Acting classes are much more about doing the acting work for your own fulfillment. It’s the idea that if you put in the work and go 100 percent with preparing and performing a scene…that in itself is honestly an A grade.”
George plans to pursue a career in acting concentrating on plays written by Ancient Greeks and Shakespeare. George hopes that “many different walks of life see [his honors thesis]. It’s a story of otherness and the journey one goes on that makes them an other in a community,” George said. The thesis performance will be open to the public. Catch the performances on Mar 3 and Mar 4 at 8 p.m. with an additional performance on Mar 5 at 3 p.m.

Since their debut in 2011, few expected three family members from the north side of Georgia to rise in the ranks of the hip hop world and lift the genre to what it is today. Legendary rapper Gucci Mane discovered these artists and aided them in finding a record deal. When all three relatives combine, they are known as Migos. Removing a letter from the Spanish word “amigos” was all that was needed to create a successful name, especially in rap. (See names like Lil’ Wayne or Young Dolph, for example). Thankfully for the three members, Quavo, Offset and Takeo (real names Quavious Marshall, Kiari Cepheus, and Kirshnik Ball), their music is admired due to their fast-rhyming style and an impeccable ability to finish each other’s rhymes and play off one-another. Continuing their success from previous singles such as “Versace,” “Hannah Montana” and “Pipe it Up,” the dynamic trio released their long-anticipated album “Culture” on Jan. 27, 2017 to critical acclaim and massive fan appeal.
The release could not have come at a better time for the three superstars, as the group hit its stride in Fall 2016 with the smash-hit single “Bad and Boujee,” produced by highly sought-after hip-hop producer Metro Boomin’. Irrelevant to the story concerning their music! As the weeks went on after the release of the single, the Migos would be catapulted to even bigger heights. Thanks to the catchy beat that Metro Boomin’ has become famous for creating, along with a famous opening line that has spawned countless internet memes (“Rain drop, drop top”), the single became the group’s first number-one hit. Following the success of the first single, Migos released two more before the album became available to increase the hype for the project even more. Songs such as “T-shirt” and “What the Price” gave fans just enough new material to feed their appetites while leaving room for much more later.
The big question for Migos fans is if the album has indeed fulfilled the hype that it created for itself. As one may have expected, this album is more of the same from the group, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but as the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it,” right? Although fans may hold the opinion that the album is similar to the group’s other projects, the consistency in the quality of the songs has not declined. In fact, certain aspects have definitely improved. The production sounds have changed a lot from what many are used to hearing from Migos, the generic same-sounding trap beats have been replaced for the most part with trap beats that still feature the signature drums, but with unique effects that add to the song. “Get Right Witcha” has a whistle-sounding effect in the background that has a distinctively different sound when is incredibly fun to listen to over the piano keys. “Call Casting” has a tribal-like feel to it due to the incorporation of horns along with other instruments. “What the Price” is a nice slow jam with a rock-and-roll guitar solo in the beginning which is an interesting change of pace.
As with many trap-inspired rap albums, the subject matter is an acquired taste that may not be liked by everyone. The “trap” is a slang term for an area in which buying and selling drugs is common. Rhyming about the struggles of living in the ghettos of Atlanta is not a subject that the majority of America can relate to, but the way in which the rappers tell their stories of hardship adds to the listening experience. Quavo, O set, and Takeo do not censor themselves from speaking about any topic, and that much is obvious from the first track onward. Speaking of the opening track, it was awful. Sounding like a teaser-track rather than a proper album introduction, the opener features an annoying verse from DJ Khaled. Aside from the occasional misses on this album, the rest of the features either live up to or exceed expectations. The Travis Scott feature fits perfectly on the beat, and Gucci Mane shines all over “Slippery.”
Zachary Lunch, an undecided freshman Migos fan, enjoys the album thoroughly. “Travis Scott’s verse, in my opinion, is amazing. He has a special flow that he [uses] as he goes along,” Lynch said. “‘Slippery’ has a trippy beat,” he said. Lynch listens to Migos when working out in the gym. Perhaps the fast rhyme schemes and hard-hitting drums will help Lynch kick in to that extra gear.

Sophie Treadwell’s “Machinal” is one of her best-known works, that appeared on Broadway between 1922-1941, and is considered by many as the finest example for American Expressionism. The Post Theatre Company will be performing “Machinal,” one of Treadwell’s best known plays, at the Little Theatre, Mainstage on February 17-18 and February 23-25 at 8p.m. and on February 19 and 26 at 3p.m. 
The cast includes Gabe Amato, Emily Banks, Tanner Bolin, Jaeda Blair, Justin Dickenson, Ervin Gonzales, Nicole Harley, Tyler Stettler, Olivia Lodge, Summer Warwick, Gabrielle McAree, Audrey Ney, Brady C. Ness, and Christine Mackerer.
Theater critic Ben Brantley spoke about the Broadway play in a New York Times review on January 16, 2014 “Sophie Treadwell’s fascinating play from 1928 about one woman’s captivity in a hell called New York City.” He described Treadwell to be a prolific and successful playwright and journalist but Machinal is one of the works for which Treadwell is known today, calling it a “rare and disturbing beauty.”
Brantley also wrote, “Its plot was inspired by the story of Ruth Snyder, a Long Island housewife who murdered her husband and died in the electric chair at Sing Sing. Yet there’s nothing tabloid about the play’s style.” “On the contrary, “Machinal” is a jagged symphony of voices, in which speech itself sounds as if it had come off a mass-production assembly line, spoken by people disconnected from their own words.”
“The show constantly reminds me of the inequality in our country, whether it be 1920 or 2017,” Gabriel Amato, a junior musical theatre major who is acting in the play, said.
Tickets for the show are available at www.tix55.com by searching for “PTC”.

Founded in September 2016 by Tanner Bolin, a junior musical theatre major, The No Control “improv” team consists of many talented students who will definitely make you laugh. This team of students, mostly theatre majors ranging from freshmen to seniors, use their improvisation skills to entertain the audience via games.
The games are easy to understand and are pretty unique at the same time. They are interactive games that require viewer participation, making it almost like a reality show. Having personally seen it twice, I recommend people to go watch it as well. It is a great initiative.
The group will be holding a show every week during common hour between 1 and 2 p.m. in the Hillwood Cinema.
Isabelle Rutens, a sophomore musical theatre major who just became the manager of the group, hopes the group will be more present on campus. “This semester we managed to add seven members to the team. Now that we have so many people, we decided to have two subgroups in the team and so each subgroup performs every alternate week. Seeing fresh faces is also important in these types of performances. I think it is great way for us improvers and the audience to relieve stress. We would love for the audience to grow and support us!”

With the ending of the Grammy Awards on Feb. 12, 2017, Chance the Rapper, born Chancelor Johnathon Bennet, established himself as a prominent figure in music for the millennial generation. The melodies of tracks like “Juke Jam” and his powerhouse features on notable well-known tracks such as “Ultralight Beam” on Kanye West’s “The Life of Pablo” have helped the young Chicago-born MC to become a fan-favorite. So much so that shows such as Jimmy Kimmel and Saturday Night Live booked him as musical talent. He even became the first-ever unsigned musical guest on Saturday Night Live due to popular demand.
For an artist’s music to qualify for a Grammy, it must be commercially released to the public. Chance the Rapper does not believe in the commercial sale of his music and allows it to be downloaded freely. On May 13, 2016, Apple Music sponsored the release of his mixtape “Chance the Rapper – Coloring Book,” which was met with great admiration from his fans. He was notched at number eight on the Billboard 200 with 38,000 equivalent album units. Since Chance did not sell a single album, it needed to be streamed a total of fifteen hundred times for it to equal one album sold. He became the first artist reaching this high on the list without selling units to boost his numbers.
After the release, fans flooded social media to support Chance to make his music Grammy-eligible. “I think it’s great that we as fans have a voice in the matter,” Dioyonte Alleyne, a senior broadcasting major, said. “Allowing the consumers to recognize who they feel is deserving of an honor for a product they made is the whole point of the award show.”
This surge of support from fans and backing from other artists, including Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Beyonce, helped pushed The Recording Academy to make changes to its rules regarding eligibility for the first time. The new rule allowed for music, that is available for free to the public, to be eligible for nomination as long as it’s available on a music streaming service that has a paid subscription option. This is a big change from the old format allowing for a wider range of music to be nominated, free or not.
Chance the Rapper made history at the Grammys, becoming the first artist to win a Grammy without registering a single record sold. He ended the night winning awards for Best New Artist, Best Performance, and most notably for Best Rap Album, a category in which he went head to head with Drake’s “Views” and Kanye West’s “The Life of Pablo”.
Chance opened his speech with a gentle lighthearted laugh: the one of a young 23-year old that accomplished something that had never been done in the history of the music industry. “Glory be to God! I claim this victory in the name of the Lord,” yelled the Chicago-native, expressing thanks and love to the many people that supported him. As the music started to drown Chance out during his time on the mic, one thing was made clear. Chance the Rapper had arrived and there was no denying his claim to the music industry any further.

The 59th annual Grammy Awards took place on Feb. 12 in Los Angeles, CA. Millions of viewers across America tuned in, including many students. Some students liked the Grammys while others thought the show could have been much better. Whether it was Adele winning Album of the Year or Katy Perry’s “controversial” performance, students across campus had something to say.
Adele opened the Grammy Awards with her popular song, “Hello.” Later in the show, she paid tribute to George Michael, who died on Dec. 25, 2016, by singing his song, “Fastlove.” She asked to restart the performance after a rocky start. “Only Adele would be allowed to restart her performance,” Irene Spanos, a senior childhood education major, said. “It made her look real and showed that everyone makes mistakes. I give her a lot of credit.”
Adele won five Grammy awards, including Album of the Year. During her acceptance speech, Adele said that Beyonce should have won the award for her album, “Lemonade.” “I was so mad that Adele did that,” Kaitlin Veygel, a senior broadcasting major, said. “I feel like she took the spotlight away from herself. Beyonce did have a good album, but Adele worked really hard and definitely deserved it.”
Beyonce also performed at the Grammy’s, after announcing to the world [the week before] that she was expecting twins. Her performance referenced the Hindu goddess, Kali; African American water goddess, Mami Wata; and Roman goddess, Venus. Some students did not appreciate the performance. “I think Beyonce’s performance was overrated and that she’s a hypocrite,” Taylor Brodsky, a freshman, said. “She is very talented, but I think she makes her performances too political.” She later won two awards and gave a powerful speech about the need for positivity in the African American community.
Katy Perry performed her new song, “Chain to the Rhythm,” while wearing an armband that read “Persist.” Many believe her performance was political because of the armband and the words, “WE THE PEOPLE” from the Constitution, on the screen behind her. “I love Katy Perry, but was very disappointed that she had to make her performance political,” Spanos said. “I feel that some things need to be left alone and an award show should be one of those things.”
Lady Gaga proved that she is proud of her body, showing up to the Grammy’s in a braless outfit after receiving hate during her Super Bowl performance because her body type did not fit her outfit choice. Gaga performed with Metallica singing, “Moth Into Flame.” Vegel said, “I am obsessed with Lady Gaga. Her performance with Metallica proves that she can sing any style music and kill it.”
Tributes were paid to The Bee Gees and Prince. Demi Lovato, Tori Kelly, Little Big Town, and Andra Day sang “Stayin’ Alive,” “Tragedy,” “How Deep Is Your Love,” and “Night Fever” to honor The Bee Gees. Bruno Mars paid tribute to Prince, who died April 21, 2016, and sang “Let’s Go Crazy. The Time also paid tribute to Prince, singing “Jungle Love” and “The Bird,” two songs co-written by Prince. Many students, including Nick Tangorra, a sophomore public relations major, enjoyed these performances. “Out of all of the performances, the tributes to Prince and The Bee Gees really stood out to me. The stars that honored them on stage did an incredible job,” Tangorra said.

The Pioneers dominated in their match against the University of the District of Columbia on Feb. 15, finishing the game with a 72-52 win over the Firebirds.
Freshman forward Mikaiya Moore and sophomore forward Sasha Patterson both scored in the double figures with 21 and 17 points, respectively. As a team, the Pioneers gained 22 points off of turnovers.
A layup from senior guard Kylie Garret at the beginning of the second quarter started a 14-4 run by the Pioneers, and they went into the half with a 14- point lead over the rebirds.
“We’ve had the lead the past three games and we’ve come out sluggish in the third quarter, and we had to try and do something different today,” head women’s basketball coach Deirdre Moore said. “We had to come out and play with the same intensity that we played within the first half.”
Moore was referring to her team’s two recent losses against New York Institute of Technology and Roberts Wesleyan College. During the game against NYIT on Feb. 4, the Bears led the Pioneers by four points at the half, and the Pioneers were able to gain a one point lead at the beginning of the fourth quarter but ultimately lost the game 59-53.
During their most recent match-up at Roberts Wesleyan on Feb. 11, the Pioneers led the home team by 15 points at the half; an 11-2 run by the Redhawks in the fourth quarter led them to a 78-70 win over the Pioneers.
The Pioneers last played UDC on their home court on Jan. 4, and won by one point in overtime 84-83. The Pioneers led the Firebirds by ten points late in the fourth quarter, but a string of turnovers and a buzzer beater by UDC’s Shantel Oliver forced the game into overtime.
During the second half of Wednesday’s game against UDC, the Pioneers seemed to have learned from those last three games, as they never let their lead fall below eight points.
“I thought that we got more control of the game late in the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter than we did the last time [against UDC],” Moore said.
The Pioneers returned to the Pratt Recreation Center on Feb. 18 for their last home game against Queens College where they lost 76-56.
The Pioneers were able to hold a small lead for most of the first quarter, but a 7-1 run by the Knights left the home team down by five by the end of the first quarter. The Knights continued to increase their lead for the rest of the game.
“I wish that we had eight defenders because needed two on 11 and two on 12,” Moore said, referring to Queens College’s two best players Madison Rowland and MacKenze Rowland who both finished with 21 and 22 points, respectively.
Moore said her offense struggled the most today, scoring only 56 points but averaging 66 points per game this season.
Freshman Mikaiya Moore led the Pioneers in scoring with 14 points and tallied eight rebounds and sophomore Sasha Patterson finished with 12 points and five rebounds.
Going into this game, the Pioneers were tied with Daemen College for the sixth spot for the playoffs. With their loss against Queens College, and Daemen winning their game against Molloy College on the same day, the Pioneers are now one game behind Daemen for the playoff spot. To make the playoffs they need Daemen to lose at least once, and they have to win their final two games.
The Pioneers will return to action on Feb. 22 when they take on the University of Bridgeport in Bridgeport, Conn. at 5 pm.

The equestrian team received quite the surprise one day during September 2016 when an unfamiliar scream sounded from inside the stables. This surprise was none other than their beloved team mascot, Ellie; a donkey belonging to team member and junior history major, Jordynn Shaffer.
After offered a position on the equestrian team August 2016, Shaffer explained how she brought Ellie to live on campus. “I also have five other horses, so in order for me to be competitive outside of the team, I needed to make arrangements for them to come, and of course I couldn’t forget Ellie so she tagged along too,” Shaffer said.
The new addition has become quite popular around the barn not only with the other members of the team, but with many of the horses as well; however, some of them are still adjusting. Junior English major, Alexa Romano, another member of the equestrian team, mentioned how the horses often tend to have inconsistent perceptions of Ellie, especially upon her first appearance. “At first it was a big wakeup call because these horses here had never seen a donkey, but of course, after awhile they got used to it.” Ellie has no trepidations being around the horses, but for many of them, the appearance of a foreign animal half their size can be slightly unnerving. “When they see her, they’ll be very startled and very scared and won’t go near her,” Romano said. After understanding that she is only a donkey and won’t hurt them, they reluctantly accept her presence.
Precautions still need to be taken occasionally; when a horse gets frightened, the sudden behavior might in turn spook Ellie who could react violently in an attempt to get away. More often than not, though, the horses absolutely love her. With the couple of mini horses on the property, Trigger and Rose, the trio get along like best friends. Fran Martinez, a caretaker of the horses in the barn, said the relationship between the two minis and Ellie is improving. “As they’ve been going out together every day and they got used to seeing her walking down the aisles and out in the pasture, they kind of just accepted her,” Martinez said.
Ellie is a rescue pet, around 8-years-old. Shaffer and her friend happened to come across the donkey on Facebook. Since she was not purchased at an auction, Ellie was waiting to be picked up from a slaughter pen in Cranbury, NJ, but thanks to Shaffer’s friend insisting they go look at her, she was convinced not to leave her there. The two pulled their money together to save her. “When we saw her, we bought her with intentions to save her and find her a home; however, now she’s a part of the family,” Shaffer said.
Shaffer is thrilled with the amount of attention Ellie has been getting. Before winter break last semester, the donkey even made an appearance in Hillwood Commons and attracted many students to take selfies with her thanks to her calm demeanor. Many of the students who paid her a visit that day had never seen a donkey in-person before, and the same went for most of the equestrian team’s members before the arrival of Ellie. Ellie is quite fond of attention, and Romano notes that the donkey has a very friendly and lovable personality. As for future visits to the campus, Shaffer said, “We kind of play it by ear and look for fun times to bring her. But there’s always a possibility.”
As of now, there are no special plans for Ellie, but she serves as an affectionate pet and mascot. Overall, she’s a fan-favorite, and despite their initial surprise, the equestrian team is happy to know that Ellie is here to stay.
“She’s a weird pet but honestly the best decision I have ever made,” Shaffer said.

Sophomore psychology major Frank Ranfone, an attacking midfielder on the men’s lacrosse team, is entering his second season for the Pioneers. Ranfone tallied seven points with four goals and three assists last year. Four games into the 2017 season Ranfone has racked up twelve points with ten goals and two assists. Nine of Ranfone’s twelve points come from his recent performance against American International College on Feb.11.
Q -You just had a seven goal game Feb 11; is that the most goals you’ve scored in one game?
A – I don’t want to say it was all me. All of my goals were assisted. We had a good day and I guess I was just the beneficiary of it.
Q – How long have you been playing lacrosse?
A – I’ve been playing since the sixth grade, so this is my eighth year playing lacrosse.
Q -Is this the best games you’ve ever had?
A -It’s the best I’ve ever had, especially at this school.
Q – Is this nine point game a sign of things to come?
A – Our offensive is really starting to click. We have a lot of good young players so I’d definitely say so as long as everyone learns their role and how they fit into our system, it will be.
Q – What made you choose LIU Post?
A – I had offers from other schools, but Post was the best balance of education and athletics. Also, it was the right distance, far enough from home but close enough to go back on the weekends.
Q – What town are you from? How was your high school lacrosse experience?
A -I’m from Guilford, Connecticut. High school was pretty good. I had a good coach and good people [who] influenced my getting to this school.
Q – Both of your roommates are lacrosse players. Is that a sign of team chemistry?
A – It’s a pretty close and tight knit unit. Everyone is pretty supportive and hardworking in practice.
Q – You’re only a sophomore. What are your goals here at Post?
A – I’d like to win conference every year I’m here, but the ultimate goal is to win the national championship. I want to get one of those before I leave here.
Q – How hard will it be to win the national championship?
A – Nothing’s easy, especially something like that, but we have the pieces. We just have to put it together.
Q – The team just had a lot of seniors graduate. How does that affect your outlook on the season?
A – I came into this season anxious because it left a lot of holes for younger players like myself to fill. We got the opportunity to step up and fill the shoes of some pretty talented seniors [who] just graduated.
Q – What do you think the biggest challenge will be?
A – Big time games. You never know how young players will handle it.
Q – What is your prediction for the upcoming Merrimack and Adelphi games?
A – I’d like to predict two wins out of those games. We’re pretty excited and we think if everyone plays their role we should come out with the win.

On Wednesday, Feb. 15, the men’s basketball team beat the University of the District of Columbia, 88-67, without their leading scorer, senior forward Greg Dotson, who was out with an injury. With the win, the Green and Gold extended their winning streak to four games.
Head Coach Eric Smiles was pleased with his team’s performance. “We played great,” Smiles said. “We came out, executed on both sides of the floor, we moved the ball very well on offense. We had a lot of guys score double digits and get involved.”
Senior guard Jemal Mosley had 19 points in the first half and finished the game with 22. Other senior guard Jared Hall had 16 points on the night, going 8 for 14 from the field, along with three rebounds and three assists. Aary Bibens, a red-shirt junior guard, had 13 points, five rebounds and two assists.
The Pioneers shot 47.9 percent from the field on the night, 40.9 percent from behind the arc and 84.6 percent from the free throw line.
In the last three minutes of the first half, the Pioneers went on an 11-2 run to go into halftime with a commanding 49-35 lead. Mosley sank four three pointer in the first half.Junior guard Kyle McLeggan sank one.
The Green and Gold continued their scoring from the first half to the second, coming out of the gate scoring 11 points in the first 5 minutes, making the margin 20 points with a 60-40 lead with 14 minutes left in the game.
Freshman forward Kyle Doucette almost finished with a double-double with 10 points and nine rebounds and two blocks. Mcleggan contributed with eight points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals.
Three days later, on Saturday, Feb. 18, LIU Post hosted Queens College, a team that beat them on Jan. 14, 100-76, and a team that hold the 6th spot in the playoffs, just above the Pioneers.
Before the Queens College game, Smiles said, “We have to come out and play hard, we didn’t give a good effort over there so we have to come out and make shots and move the ball. “They (Queens) shoot the most threes at the best percentage, so we have to do a good job taking away their shot.”
After their win against UDC, Post was just half a game back in the standings from making that 6th playoff spot.
It was Senior Day at the Pratt Center on Feb 18. Looking to give their home fans a fitting send-off, the Pioneers started off hot. Just four minutes after tip-off , the up-tempo Pioneer offense, spearheaded by playmaking senior point guard Jared Hall, had tallied 12 points in just seven possessions.
With an early eight-point lead and an invigorated home crowd behind them, all signs pointed to the Pioneers taking and holding a commanding first half lead over the under-sized Queens College Knights. However, ten costly turnovers by the Pioneers in the first half quickly gave momentum to the sharp shooting Queens Knights, and they capitalized.
The Knights outscored the Pioneer’s by 23 points. With two minutes left to play in the first half, the Knights’ lead had swelled to a 15 point margin, putting the Pioneers in a precarious position as they headed to the locker room down 43-31.
“It was a tough first half, we made some miscalculations,” Smiles said of the team’s first half performance. Queens College had shot over 54% from behind the three point arch in the first half, and out rebounded the Pioneers 18-11.
In an attempt to turn the tide of this game, Smiles looked to his bench and inserted freshman forward Hall Elisais. Elisais made his presence known in the first half, blocking one shot and scoring a two point basket off a missed layup within his first minute of action. “He’s a beast,” Smiles said, “He’s just a freshman; he’s going to be really good for us next year.” Elisais went on to sink all eight of his free throw attempts.
Just like that, the Knights’ lead had shrunken to three, with just over six minutes to go. The Pioneers made one last push to take their first lead since the first half, but the Knights scored 17 points in the final minutes of the game, beating the Pioneers on their home court, 84-72.
For seniors Jared Hall, Greg Dotson, who returned for the first time since being injured, and Jemal Mosely, the three seniors on the team, Saturday’s game was their last on their home court. “It’s disappointing we couldn’t get a win for our guys [seniors],” Smiles said.
With an overall record of 9-17, this will be the first losing season under Coach Smiles in his four years as head coach of The Pioneers. But, Smiles remains optimistic about next season. “We were a young team this year, but next year we are going to be a really good team.”

The seventh ranked Pioneers lost to third ranked Merrimack College 12-5 during a home match-up Feb 18.
A young Pioneer offense was plagued by 19 turnovers, 12 of which came in the first half of the game. The Pioneers were scoreless after the first quarter, falling behind the Warriors 3-0. Sophomore attackman/mid elder Frank Ranfone was assisted by junior attackman Chris Trasacco to score the first goal for the Pioneers in the second quarter.
