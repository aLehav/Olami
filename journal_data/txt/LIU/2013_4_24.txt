With the magnitude of his recent success, Miguel is headed straight to the top. Luckily, LIU Post was able to snag him just in time for ACP’s annual Spring Fling concert.
Just a couple of months ago, Miguel won his first Grammy for Best R&B song, “Adorn”. Since then, he’s been on SNL, where he performed “Adorn,” and new single “How Many Drinks?” which has become a YouTube sensation, especially after the infamous “mic drop” that concluded the performance. If you haven’t seen it yet, get Googling now.
Stage presence. That’s what Miguel gave the students who attended his concert at the Tilles Center on Saturday, April 20. Performing a full set, and even singing his current hit, “Adorn,” twice, Miguel and his band kept a jam-packed Tilles Center completely engaged throughout the show.
The incredible recent success this young L.A. based musician has encountered has not stopped him from remaining breathtakingly humble and down to earth.
Pioneer editors and WCWP representatives, Olivia Wicik, Alex Parker, David Otero and Christina Kay were invited for an exclusive preshow interview with Miguel. It was almost easy to overlook that this was the same man who stunned us on SNL just days earlier.
WCWP: What has this year been like for you?
Miguel: It’s been surreal; it’s been a lot of fun, a lot of work, but nothing short of amazing. I’m really excited about what we’ve ac- complished this year thus far and the music we’re going to put out later this year.
WCWP: Is that a hint at a new album?
M: Could be. You never know. We’ll definitely release some new music though. I did a series of EP’s and we’re going to continue that this year.
WCWP: What have some of the highlights been since the last time we’ve talked, right before “Sure Thing” came out?
M: Playing at the Grammys this year has been incredible. We dropped “Sure Thing” and went on tour with Usher…went to Europe to do my solo tour for the first time which was amazing. Then we toured with Trey; that was incredible. I got in the best shape that I’ve ever been in. That was work but it was definitely, definitely worth it…all worth it in the end. Since then, we’ve been back to London, back to the UK and Europe on our own again and then I came back and just finished the very first leg of the Alicia Keys tour. We did the domestic portion and now we’re about to go to Europe with her in two weeks. It’s been good. We just released a new video for the new single “How Many Drinks?” with Kendrick Lamar, who is a good friend. I’m excited.
WCWP: There’s a lot of amazing buzz about that video [How Many Drinks?] on Twitter. You’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback on that…
M: Yeah, its been great. I guess the fans really like it and I co-directed the video and wrote the treatment and kind of came up with the concept. Clark Jones, who I’ve worked with before has just been really, really cool about letting me be hands on, down to edit- ing the video and then just putting final touches on it. It’s been good, I’m happy that people enjoy it.
WCWP: You performed it on SNL last week…
M: Yes, I performed my version of that song, how I wanted it to be, and that was great.
WCWP: I loved the mic drop on the end. That was so smooth!
M: Oh, was it? I don’t know, was that smooth? Let me ask you a question, I honestly think a lot of things I do are not smooth but just because it’s “R&B” they kind of throw that in there? That was hardly a smooth move. I wasn’t planning on it, it just kind of felt like the thing to do at the time. When I’m on stage I just kind of don’t even think about it. It’s just; I do what I feel.
WCWP: You just had “Power Trip” come out with J. Cole. How was working with him?
M: J. Cole is like another one of my brothers in this music business. I’m a huge fan of his. I was just really excited for him to invite me to be on the record. When he told me about the concept I thought it was super creative and I was really excited about it. The video was fun. It was directed by Nabil. I’m a huge fan of his so it was cool to meet him and work with him for the first time too.
WCWP: What’s it like when you hear the crowd singing along with you?
M: I don’t know if I can really explain that. It’s not something I can really give to anyone, it’s just if you know it, you know it. It’s a blessing. I definitely appreciate it as a musician. I’ve defi- nitely been in front of people… and it hasn’t always been that way. It’s cool to have that level of support and have that familiarity with my fans.
WCWP: So, it’s been a busy week for you. You’ve been here, there and everywhere. Have you heard you just got voted for TIME magazine’s Top 100 influential people?
M: Wow, yeah, I don’t know why. Seriously. I’m really appreciative of it though. But yeah, it’s kind of mind blowing. To be really obscure and to kind of gain people’s attention or awareness is really cool, especially when it’s because of something you love. I created an album I loved and that I’m really proud of and a lot of people are discovering me, because of the music and the stuff that I’m doing and I’m really passionate about. It’s special.
WCWP: Do you have a favorite, personal song? Or a song you prefer to perform compared to others? Or are they all like your children, you can’t pick one?
M: Yeah! It’s kind of like that. I have my moods too, so sometimes I feel a song one mo- ment more than the next. You know, “Adorn’s” been life changing. But “Sure Thing” has been life changing because that’s what got me signed, you know. But “Adorn”…that has been the song that is introducing me to a lot of people.
WCWP: Wiz Khalifa’s on the remix [of “Adorn”]. Was that an original thought of yours?
M: No, man, that was actually at the suggestion of Mark Pitts, who’s my A&R, which, was brilliant. He has a really good thermometer for what is and what is not…dope. What makes sense and what doesn’t. But, I don’t think the song would have reached as many people without Wiz on it. That remix really added longevity to the record and being number one in R&B for like 23 weeks was like a record, for R&B records. That’s special to me, but I couldn’t have done it without Wiz. A lot of stations wouldn’t have even played that record without Wiz on it, so it was a great movement and Wiz is just a great dude. I appreciate what he brought to the record and I appreciate him performing with us for the Grammys and everything.
The Pioneer: You were just talking about your song, “Sure Thing,” and how it got you signed. I read that it was a highly personal track, not meant for anyone else to hear, so how did you let that out?
M: It was at the suggestion of my manager at the time. He asked for the record. I played it for him and he was like this song is crazy, can you send it to me. I was like yeah… I don’t really want anyone else to hear it. He was like, no seriously, send it to me, so I said okay and good thing I did because he got it to Mark Pitts, who eventu- ally did end up signing me.
TP: That might hit home for some college students; if they have something personal they created that they might be scared to share. Would you have any advice for those students?
M: Absolutely. I have a younger brother, who is a genius. He’s a champion of his music and an incredible artist and musician, but I always tell him, you have to put it out. You just have to put it out there. You have to start somewhere. There’s a beginning to every story. Until people hear it, they’re never going to become familiar and whether or not it’s the greatest thing you do, it really kind of pales in comparison to just starting. It’s really important to keep that in mind because life is all about evolving and growing and you kind of want to document the progress. There’s no way of doing that if you never put it out there.
TP: Who has been your biggest musical influence?
M: Prince, by far, has probably been one of the biggest. Not even so much [his] music; I think it’s just his character. He always did what he felt, his choices as a musician and the tenacity. He really was adventurous and fearless. I don’t know if those are the right words, but I think you understand what I mean. When you look at Prince, you think he was the artist that didn’t have bound- aries and did what he felt. That inspired me and I hope to inspire people to not be bogged down with what people expect and the status quo. I think it’s cool to be free and create freely.
TP: Do you have any preshow rituals you follow?
M: No, not too many. I hang out with my guys. My band is my brothers and I think we really share a great friendship. We just joke around until last minute; we have our preshow huddle and I have an apple, if I can.
TP: Who else would you like to work with in the future?
M: There’s a lot…there’s a lot of artists. More recently I’ve been wanting to work with Sky Ferriera; she’s really dope. I’ve always been a fan of hers but never thought about collaborating with her, but I think it would be really cool. Jack White. Kanye West. Andre 3000. David Bowie is putting music out now, again, which is great, awesome. I’d love to work with him, or write with him, or have him write for me, I don’t know whatever. Anything! I can make him a sandwich or something. No, no I’m a huge fan of his, so that would be cool. I can go on and on. Yeah…The Lumineers are really dope…
TP: What’s been the hardest adjustment for you after reaching celebrity status? Has anything been particularly hard to get used to?
M: My career hasn’t really had a crazy trajectory. It wasn’t an overnight thing. It’s been a bless- ing. It’s kind of had its levels and I’ve gotten to adjust at every level and I look forward to move on and grow. I can’t say anything has been really hard. It’s been seamless.
TP: You’re just a natural!
M: No, no it has nothing to do with me! It just has everything to do with circumstance. It’s just been a blessing.
TP: Can you tell us a little bit about your jewelry? You have some great pieces.
M: Most of it is by this company called The Great Frog; they are based in London. The Great Frog is kind of like the original head-bangers jeweler. You know what I mean? From Led Zeppelin to The Stones…rock bands and metal bands.
TP: Where else do you want to travel? You’ve been all over the place, is there anywhere else you’re hoping to go?
M: I hope my music takes me everywhere. There’s no place I wouldn’t want to go. I’ve learned so much from my travels, just culturally. I never had the money or ability to travel before.
TP: What’s your favorite place that you’ve been to so far?
M: There are a lot of favorites…that’s tough. There are just moments. Where were we? Cape Town? Diving in the ocean, after a few glasses of whiskey just being like, we’re going to jump in the water. You know what I mean? Shark infested waters, mind you. Its just moments. London’s great. Paris is romantic, like they say. It really is, as cliché as it is. It’s just beautiful.
TP: Biggest piece of advice for Post students, who want to be like you?
M: Oh man, be yourself. That’s the coolest thing. Don’t do it unless you are really passionate about it. I’ve been really blessed to be around passionate people. You know, my band members are all really passionate about what they do and they make their own music on the side and the fact that they still get to share a part of their passion with me on stage. My team, my management, these are all people I’ve been lucky to have around. It’s been a gradual building of my team, my core. The ones I get to share these experiences with. You make additions and you hope for the best, but we’ve been blessed. Life is all about passion. You don’t want to do anything you’re not passionate about; you’ll have some regrets if you do.
Passion was unquestionably something that Miguel brought on stage with him. Aside from his remarkable voice that easily resembled an array of instruments, especially when he hit those high-pitched notes, he added his own personal touch to the concert. Sharing anecdotes to introduce certain songs was something that truly let Post students see the type of individual he was.
Miguel was not only passionate but also extremely appreciative. He let the audience know by proposing a toast. “Put one finger in the air,” he told everyone, “I want to make a toast.” Of course, the crowd did just that, and what followed was, “Here’s to health, wealth, prosperity and following every dream you’ve ever had. Don’t ever, ever, ever, ever, stop being passionate. It’s 2013… we made it!”

Asya Ashour, an Accounting major with an English minor, has been named this year’s valedictorian. Minqi Li, also an Accounting major, is the first international student in LIU Post history to receive the salutatorian title.
As part of the valedictorian tradition, Ashour will be giving a speech at this year’s commencement ceremony.
For Li, who didn’t expect to even be nominated for the honor, the title offers a sense of accomplishment. “I am grateful to be the first international student to be salutatorian and it feels good after four years of hard work,” said Li.
As an international student from China, Li said that it was difficult for her to even read a textbook in English when she first came here. Conversing with people who only spoke English was also a challenge that Li had to overcome.
Ashour said that she was honored to hear that she was valedictorian as well. She has already begun to think about her commencement speech that she will deliver on May 10. “It’s still a work in progress; I haven’t written it out yet and I don’t want to give it away,” she said.
At LIU Post, the process of choosing the valedictorian and salutatorian consists of several steps: first, a computer system selects a number of seniors with the highest G.P.A’s in the graduating class. . “This year that was a group of about 50 students out of about a 1,000 undergrad’s that gradaate each year,” said Carson. Students don’t necessarily need to possess a cumulative average of a perfect 4.0, but according to Carson, they rarely have anything lower than a 3.97. Ashour has a G.P.A of a 4.0 and Li has a 3.97.
Once the students with the highest G.P.A’s are selected, a committee weeds out those who are ineligible; such as students that transferred to Post with over three years worth of credits. The committee then starts looking at other positive qualities that the students possess. Eventually, eight students are chosen to continue the search process.
Those eight students are sent an email is sent asking them to write an essay and get two letters of recommendation. During the final steps, the candidates are interviewed by the selection committee, which is made up of professors from each of the schools on campus, Associate Provost William Gustafson, Assistant Provost Jessica Hayes and Carson herself.
“They should be well-rounded and have other things besides a high G.P.A. going for them,” said Carson.
Some other qualities that the selection committee looks for in a candidate, according to Carson, include their community service, ability to speak to large groups of people, the message that they wish to deliver and the
theme they would like to communicate in their speech.
The valedictorian and salutatorian title is a recognition of Ashour and Li’s accomplishments; they also get privileges such as being on stage for the entire ceremony and are invited to attend a breakfast with trustees.
A notable aspect of the valedictorian and the salutatorian is their commitment to the community. Both Li and Ashour spent hours volunteering with Volunteer Income Tax Assis- tance (VITA), an income tax program designed to help people with low-incomes file their tax returns for free.
This experience, according to Ashour, gave her a glance into what her future might be like, that is, if she decides to become a tax accountant.
“[Working for VITA] made me really awed about how much they [clients] respect us, and I got the feeling that I really have to live up to their expectations. Since they are putting so much trust in us, we have a duty to live up to their expectations and to be trustworthy,” said Ashour.
Li also had a positive experience when she volunteered at VITA.
“Not only can I help them [the clients], but I can feel good about myself and get more knowledge about filing tax returns,” she said. She added that tax returns in the U.S. are a lot more complicated and have a lot more rules than they do in China, where she lived until she came to LIU Post, four years ago.
After graduation, Li plans to pursue a Master’s degree in finance at a New York university because she is not ready to leave the state just yet. However, after she finishes school, she plans to go back to China and help her boyfriend expand his textile business.
Ashour is still undecided about what she plans to do after graduation. She is currently applying for jobs and graduate schools. “I don’t like to plan too much, I just let it happen,” Ashour said.

In only two weeks, LIU Post students will trade in their school bags for beach bags and go on a much needed summer break. The time for exams, all-nighters, early classes, but most importantly – textbooks, will be over. Instead of spending hours upon hours read- ing textbooks such as Modern Operating Systems for Computer Science class, or The Norton An- thology of Western Literature for English class, students will have the time to read books that interest them.
Nicole Cosentino, a second year English Literature graduate student, is looking forward to reading On The Road, the story of Jack Kerouac’s travels with his friends across America. She will also look out for TsiTsi Dangarembga’s final book of her trilogy that will be published over the summer. Cosentino believes that reading over the summer is vital for students regardless of their major. She believes that reading is a great way for students to sharpen their minds and enhance their vocabulary.
Cosentino says that she usually read two books a month when school is in session, but when she has time off, she likes to read a book a week. “[It] is a wonderful way to spend extra time; it is a relaxing activity that enhances creativity, vocabulary, and recall ability.” Cosentino’s favorite literary choices right now are the pre-colonial, colonial and postcolonial genres, and she will be sure to read those sorts of books over the summer. She believes that these particular genres are a great way to explore trends in traditions and culture, and how they present themselves today. Cosentino also recommends old classics like Fran- kenstein by Mary Shelley, about a scientist Victor Frankenstein, who creates a grotesque monster in sci- entific experiment.
She also suggests Heart of the Darkness by Joseph Conrad, a short novel presented as a frame narrative about the character Charles and his job as an ivory transporter down the Congo River. These books have themes that are even relevant today. She states, “There is something out there for everyone! I say ditch the standard Barnes & Noble experience and take a trip to The Book Revue in Huntington Village. The establish- ment has a treasure trove of local writers’ works, as well as antique novels and guest speakers.”
Dr. Margaret Hallissy, an English Professor at Post, reads a lot of books not only because it is a part of her job, but because she, as she would call herself, is a “book addict.” She can’t really say if she reads more or less books over the summer months because she always reads several books at the same time, regardless of the sea- son; she buys more books than she can handle. She states that she is “hoarding them, as if a book famine were imminent.” She states, “Over the summer, I always read works allied to my fall courses. This fall, I am teaching a History of Irish Literature class, and so I have on my desk some recent Irish fiction that I may or may not cover in the class, but certainly want to read. Roddy Doyle’s, The Dead Republic, is the third book in a trilogy focus- ing on Henry Smart, a young man born in 1900 that lives through and participates in key events in twentieth century Irish history.” Hallissy will have the novel The Likeness, by Tana French, in her beach bag at all times over the summer because it too aligns with her fall class. In these books, by Tana French, we get to follow detective Cassie Maddox, a member of the Dublin police force’s murder squad.
Hallissy will also continue her Hutton Book Group over the summer, focusing on recently published collections of short fiction: What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank, by Nathan Englander, and Astray, Emma Donoghue. The Hutton Book Group is a reading group on campus open to members of the surrounding community.
“Everything I’ve read by these two writers has been excellent.” She continues, “And then I have several novels on my desk not related to school at all, but related to summer travel, including Richard Ford’s Canada and Eva Stachniak’s The Winter Palace. I’ve been to Canada many times, but feel that I don’t know much about it; last summer I went to St. Peters- burg in Russia and saw the actual palace that was home to Catherine the Great.”
For students, Hallissy recommends reading recently published novels since they usually comment on the fact that they only read old classics in class. She says, “I would especially think about reading young writers, new talents that the students can follow for years. For example, The New York Times (4/16/13, C2) published a list, “The 20 Under 40,” of young British writers. American writers close to the students’ own generation with whose works I am familiar would include Colson Whitehead, whose Sag Harbor is a great sum- mer read of local interest, and Karen Russell, whose Swamplandia!, is set in an alligator-themed park in Florida.” She also recommends finding books in Bookmarks Magazine, or on the website www. bookmarksmagazine.com. Hallissy feels strongly that students should read books over the summer, “What else would you do for four whole months? But seriously, the one thing I would not do is to read junk just because it’s warm out. In every genre, whether it’s science fiction, westerns, mystery, horror, whatever, there are important writers worthy of the attention of college students. And their books will fit nicely in a beach bag.”
For Dr. John Lutz, Chair of the English Department, reading over the summer is very different since he has to outline passages and take notes for class. Lutz states, “I’m always reading and have a pile of books waiting to be read. Over the summer, I’ll catch up on some recently published novels, literary criticism and reread some classics.” This summer Lutz is particularly looking forward to read Last Man on Tower, a thrilling murder story that tells the story of a struggle for appealing Mumbai real estate, by Aravida Adiga, Lutz believes that reading is extremely valuable. “It enables us to enter into imaginary worlds that depict human situa- tions that we might not encounter ourselves in a way that allows us to understand ourselves and others better. It prepares us for decisions in life where our hap- piness and well-being may be at stake and provides us with inner resources to cope with life choices of all kinds,” says Lutz. Lutz recommends students at Post to read everything and anything over the summer because it enables you to broaden your interests.
So whether or not you are a bookworm, this is the time to dig into the world of imagination and adventure. There are plenty of different genres to pick from, so make sure to go to your local bookstore and pick out something that you would like.

Most apps are compatible for different Smartphones. Whether you’re using an iPhone or Android, you can still download the same apps. The problem with downloading apps is that they can take up a lot of space. It’s important to research your apps before you down- load them, even if they are free, to reserve memory space. Here is my review on a few different apps that I think are important to have.
The most beneficial apps for college students are ones you can incorporate into your everyday routine. The main social networking apps are a must have. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are all free, and allow you to share your photos and updates with your friends. Tumblr is also a convenient free app provid- ing those who blog from their computers with a mobile option. Foursquare is similar to Twitter, but allows you to share your location with friends instead of text updates. When you check into a location on Foursquare, it shows you how many people are checked in there, as well as reviews on the location, ratings, and comments. You can even look through pictures that were taken there, or post your own. This app is great because if you go to a new restaurant you can get an idea of its quality, or even read recommendations. I’ve checked into restaurants before that recommended dishes and/or servers. Sometimes, by checking in somewhere, the app will even give discounts! I once checked into Planet Hollywood, and they awarded me with a discount at their souvenir store. “My favorite app would have to be Facebook,” said sophomore Music major, Joshua Libal. “It gives me a way to stay connected [with friends and events] when I am not at the computer.”
It’s always good to keep an alarm on your phone that you can rely on, additional to the one that already comes on your phone. “Alarm Clock Xtreme” ismy personal favorite; it allows me to create multiple, labeled, weekly alarms, and comes with different sounds to choose from. This is crucial in terms of time management. Your weekly schedule can be programmed into your phone with the swipe of your finger.
When you’re out with friends and hear a good song that you can’t remember the name of, or a new song that you enjoy, Shazam will provide the title, artist, and al- bum cover along with links to hear the song straight from your Smartphone. This app is great because once you click the Shazam button to try and decipher a song they are automatically saved in a list called “tags” that you can refer back to at any time. If you want to purchase the song for yourself later, you can check out your tags list and your song will still be listed there!
Another important download would be your bank; this could be extremely helpful regarding money management. By keeping your bank account on your phone (password protected, of course), you can transfer or review your money at any time on the go. If you’re out to eat and not sure how much money you have, you can budget yourself by checking your app. I use Citibank, and this comes in handy to me all the time. I’ll be at the mall and have no idea where I’m at with money, and that app will remind me to save.
The Dictionary.com app has saved me a few times in class or while completing assignments. This app also has a thesaurus, which is extremely convenient when searching for variations or trying not to sound redundant.
Of course you have to have your utilities, personal and social networking apps, but it’s never a bad idea to have at least one en- tertaining app on your phone. Two of my favorites are “I’d Cap That”, which automatically adds funny and witty captions onto your photos, or Snapchat from which you can send funny pictures and videos of yourself to friends that only can be viewed for a certain amount of time. Senior Art Therapy major, Sara Nami, said, “I think it’s great that there is practically an app for everything! My favorite app would have to be Snapchat. I love that I can exchange funny pictures with my friends throughout the day.”
Games are always really good to have for when you’re traveling or waiting for someone, but those are personality based. My favorites are Peggle and Bloon’s. Peggle is a fun time killer, which kind of reminds me of ski-ball. Instead of rolling a ball into different points, you have to hit as many orange “peggles” that you can in each level. There are a few different types of Bloon’s games, my personal fa- vorite being Bloon’s tower defense. In this game, you have to block balloons from getting across your
path by building different defenses around the board. The intruding balloons pick up speed as the game goes on, and becomes more difficult for you to pop. I don’t play games that often while I’m out, but I have found that these are the most entertaining when I’m at the airport or in the passenger seat of a lengthy car ride.
There are millions of apps out there, whether in your An- droid play store or Apple app store, but some of them turn out to be kind of disappointing. Be sure to read reviews and look into your apps before downloading them or purchasing them, and try not to use up all your space on apps you wont use!

LIU Post’s very own film professor, Lisa Robinson, screened her short film “HOLLOW” at the festival this year. Robinson already has one feature film under her belt with 2011’s “Small, Beautifully Moving Parts” and has an alternating career teaching and making films. With “HOLLOW”, Robinson embarked on a project of sci-fi and futuristic intrigue. In the near future, information on the web is no longer secure, but NeuroLockTM has found a way to encrypt and guard data using the hu- man brain. Iris, young and unemployed, must choose between her bleak prospects and well- paid work as a “Neuro-Messenger,” a career with some serious side effects.
The film was one of seven films com- missioned by ITVS (funded by PBS) as part of their FUTURESTATES series and stars the talented Angelic Zambrana (“Precious”) and Louisa Krause (“Martha Marcy May Marlene”). You can find out more info on the series here: http://futurestates.tv/about/
The Pioneer spoke with Robinson about “HOLLOW, her involvement in the Tribeca Film Festival and her experiences both in and out of the classroom.
The Pioneer: How can you describe the film?
Robinson: The short film is called “HOLLOW.” It’s 20 minutes long. I would categorize it a futuristic drama with some elements of science fiction in it.
TP: At what point did you know the film would be in the festival? What was that process like?
LR: ITVS – the executive producer of the film organized this screening with the Tribeca Film Festival and chose four of the seven Futurestates films. I found out the film was chosen about a month ago.
The film will also launch in May on the online site as part of a roll out of seven films. You can access the series and the trailer for “HOLLOW” through http://futurestates.tv/episodes/hollow.
TP: You already have one feature film under your belt (Small, Beautifully Moving Parts). In what ways were you perhaps more informed and prepped for this new project? Was it smoother?
LR: For “HOLLOW,” I enjoyed focusing on a shorter format. Because it was futuristic there were greater demands put on things like production design, costume, visual FX and locations but I also had more resources allotted to those elements and benefitted from shooting the whole film in Brooklyn rather than all over the country as was the case with “Small, Beautifully Moving Parts.”
TP: You must be a very busy person, budgeting a career making films and a career teaching the art of filmmaking. What is that like? Do you have any advice for college stu- dents looking to become more organized?
LR: I think organization is a very per- sonal thing. Everyone manages it differently. I’m someone who actually enjoys being busy most of the time and I like how my filmmak- ing intersects with and constantly renews my teaching of film. It also works that teaching allows me to focus on film in a different way and can trigger creative ideas. They are pretty symbiotic that way.

Do you have a bunch of friends just sitting around and a big open space that you don’t use? Tired of the regular Frisbee games and want something more challenging? Try a round of Kabaddi.
My favorite part of writing this column is to learn how to play and about the history of all these strange sports. After researching both the history and the rules of the sports I normal- ly have a good understanding of how to play them. This time though, it was a little rough, but try to stay with me.
The game is played with two teams of seven players, on a field that is divided into two equal squares. Before the game starts, you flip a coin to see who starts as the offensive team. The teams alternate offense and defense until the game is over.
Now it starts to get interesting.
The offending team sends out a “raider” to the enemy side of the field where he tries to touch as many of the opposing teams players as possible, before returning safely to his side of the field. There is a catch though; he needs to do all this while yelling: “kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi…” repeatedly and in one long breath.
If he makes it back to safety in one breath, all the players he tagged need to leave the field, and the offensive team gets a point for each of them.
The defenders on the other side can obviously try to hold the “raider” back on their side, so he runs out of breath. To make it fair the defense can only try to hold the “raider” back after he tagged the first player, as well as only four “stoppers” can be on the field at one time. If a “raider” is stopped before returning home, or he fails to continuously yell “kabaddi,” he is ruled out of the game. The team with the most points after two, 20 minute halves, wins the game. In other words, a more advanced version of the childhood game “Tag” or “You’re It”.
No, I’m not making this up; it is actually a real sport. Some articles suggest that it can be dated over 400 years back, when Indian soldiers used the game to improve their self-defense skills. The first time Kabaddi received international attention was dur- ing the Olympic Games in Ber- lin in 1936, when the game was introduced as a potential new Olympic sport. The application never went through, but the sport was inducted into the In- dian Olympic Games in 1938.
India has not surprisingly dominated the sport at the inter- national level, as they have won the World Cup in 2004, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012. In the 2012 tournament, there were 16 coun- tries competing, including Den- mark, Norway, the U.K. and the United States.
If you would like to play the sport; there is no official Kabaddi Group in New York, but there is a small group who plays occasionally in Flushing Meadows Park in New York City. I do not have many tips on how to become a good enough Kabaddi player to join the U.S. National team, but if you dominated the school yard playing “tag” as a kid, maybe this is the sport for you.

Niagara University announced the hiring of Chris Casey to become their next men’s basketball head coach on Monday, April 22. Last season, Casey guided the Pioneers to an 18-9 record. Over his three-year stay at LIU Post he brought a winning attitude as shown by his 62- 25 overall record.
Jon Rothstein, a College Basketball Insider for CBS Sports Network and WFAN, was one of the first reporters to break the story that Casey was leaving Post. Rothstein said in a tweet back on April 12 that “Casey is heavily involved with the vacancy at Niagara, per multiple sources.”
When trying to contact Casey, he apolo- gized and he said he could not comment on the matter. Niagara’s Director of Athletics, Tom Crowley, was unavailable to give a statement when trying to contact him. However, at Casey’s press conference welcoming him to Niagara, Crowley said that Casey “has a well- rounded experience in college basketball that will serve him well as our new men’s basketball coach. He has an energetic and enthusiastic approach and a long history of helping student- athletes reach their dreams both in the classroom and on the court.”
Casey’s first season under the helm for Post was the 2010-2011 season when he directed the team to a 21-10 record and an East Coast Conference Championship. In the first round of the NCAA Division II East Regional, the Pioneers lost 74-60 to Bentley University. Four Pioneers were selected to All-ECC teams, and Stefan Bonneau earned ECC Player of the Year under the tutelage of Casey.
Vaughn Allen is a junior forward for the Pioneers who was recruited by Casey, and has played his entire collegiate career under his guidance. “I’m going to miss his coaching style, the friendship that we built up over the last three years. He brought me in as a freshman when he was a new coach in the system and he put a lot of trust in me. I’m going to miss a lot of things both on and off the court.”
Following Casey’s first season, the Pio- neers earned their second consecutive ECC Championship and finished with a 23-6 record. It was their fourth championship in five years and once again, the team made its way to the NCAA Tournament. Again, Casey coached the ECC Player of the Year (Bonneau), and at the same time he helped mold the game of the ECC Rookie of the Year (Tyuan Williams). For the outstanding campaign, Casey was awarded the ECC Coach of the Year and as well as the Divi- sion II Coach of the Year. However, the season ended on a tough note as the Pioneers lost 66- 65 in the first round of the Tournament against Adelphi College.
This past year, the Pioneers had a difficult time as the season progressed. The team start- ed out dropping all of its first three contests, but rebounded rattling off 11 straight victories. After that, the Pioneers alternated wins and losses in six consecutive games, unable to develop a rhythm throughout games. The Pio- neers entered the ECC Tournament as a threeseed, but lost to Dowling College in the first round of the playoffs, and their season came to an abrupt end.
Casey takes over at Niagara (a Division I university), which needed to fill its vacancy after previous head coach, Joe Mihalich, left to coach Hofstra University. Casey becomes the second consecutive LIU Post men’s basketball coach to join the MAAC. Three years ago, Casey replaced Tim Cluess at Post. Since then, Cluess has engineered two NCAA Tournament appearances for Iona.
“As a member of the broadcast team, it makes my life a whole lot easier when members of the athletic department share the same enthusiasm that we share,” said Matt Soldano, WCWP’s men’s basketball play-by-play an- nouncer during last season. “Coach Casey was always very gracious to accommodate us with interviews from either himself or his players. I think I speak for everyone at WCWP when I say, we wish him nothing but the most success at Niagara.”
Allen looked back on his favorite experience with Casey. “Winning our first ECC Cham- pionship my freshman year. That’s my favorite memory. That got the school on the right track.”
Casey is the 21st head coach in Niagara’s men’s basketball history. On Monday during his introduction to Niagara’s players, students and staff, Casey said: “I am very aware of the history of Niagara University and the Niagara basketball program. To have the honor to coach here is very exciting and I am looking forward to getting started.”
LIU Post has not yet announced who will be coaching this upcoming season for the Pioneers.

With commencement on May 10, LIU Post’s 2013 graduating class is getting ready to enter the workforce.
Jason Cascone, director of Career Development at the Office of Career Services, provided a checklist in order to help students with their job search after graduation:
1) You should start your job search preparation now. Cascone suggests editing your resume, learning how to write cover letters, building an interviewing strategy, and understanding the industry or industries you would like to enter. He also encourages you to understand the job search process and resources as soon as possible.
2) Think broadly about what you might want your first job to be. There are available jobs, but there are also a lot of people vying for those jobs. This makes getting interviews and getting hired very difficult. The more options you give yourself, the more options you might have.
3) Network online and in person. “Clean up” your Facebook, Twitter and other social media accounts, develop a LinkedIn account for professional networking and join and participate in relevant groups. Don’t be afraid to approach family members and friends for potential job leads.
4) Stay positive and have thick skin during the job search process. It can take weeks to get hired. You may not hear from potential employers for a while. The lack of communication or lack of interviews doesn’t necessarily mean you didn’t land the job. However, before you send out your resume, send it to Career Services for a critique through the Optimal Resume system.
5) Treat your job search like a full-time job. Stay committed to finding a job until you land one.
6) Remember that your first job shouldn’t (and will most likely not) be your only job. When you find your entry-level job, breathe a sigh of relief, but don’t become complacent. Start preparing for your next move, either look- ing towards a future promotion or to a different company, especially if your current job is not your ideal employment. You need to be your own advocate and actively adapt to the job market and potential opportunities to achieve your career goals.
Graduating senior Sara Nami, an Art Therapy major, shared her feelings about graduating; “It’s a bittersweet feeling – I don’t want to finish, but I’m excited for what is yet to come,” she said. “My plans are either to find a job hopefully as a recreational/activities thera- pist and/or come back to LIU Post for the Art Therapy graduate program.”
However, for some students, graduating seems almost unreal. “Due to my busy schedule with student teaching and my job at the Writing Center, it doesn’t feel like I am even leaving; the fact that graduation is coming up seems surreal,” said Rosemarie Scalfani, an English Education major. “Thinking about the job search ahead of me once I’m graduated terrifies me; I have no idea where I am going to end up. I am starting grad school in the fall at Hofstra, but that’s the only plan that I have right now.”
If you’re having trouble with your resume or preparing for interviews, stop by the Career Services Office in Kumble Hall for more assistance. You’ll find counselors ready to help you with every aspect of your job hunt. Good Luck!

A four-goal third quarter helped propel the men’s lacrosse team to a 9-5 win over the Dowling Golden Lions on Saturday, April 20. This victory over the Golden Lions moves the Pioneers to a 9-2 overall record and a 5-1 East Coast Conference record.
It was LIU who jumped on the scoreboard first. Freshman attacker Ryan Slane recorded the goal at 13:48, but less than two minutes later the Golden Lions would tie the game up. The Pio- neers and Golden Lions would trade a pair of goals to tie the game at two, however LIU Post would go ahead 4-2 late in the first quarter off of goals by fresh- man attacker Matty Beccari and graduate attack Joe Costello.
Sophomore midfielder Con- nor Drost made it 5-2 with a goal with 5:02 left to play in the second quarter. Dowling began to close the gap late in the half. With 2:10 left to play, freshman midfielder Tom Cleary scored to cut the Pio- neer lead to 5-3. Then with three seconds remaining, freshman mid-fielder Brian White scored to make it a one-goal game.
The Pioneers’ defense stood strong to start the second half, keeping Post in front. After roughly five minutes, the offense kicked in as well. Drost extended the Pioneer lead back to two, with 9:48 left in the third quarter. Costello scored at 2:48 later to make it 7-4.
Slane recorded two more goals to finish the game with a four-goals. He scored at the 2:54 mark of the third quarter and then again with two seconds remaining in the quarter to make it 9-4.
Dowling put one more goal on the board midway through the game’s final quarter, but it would not help the Golden Lions cause, as they eventually fell 9-5.
The Pioneers held the ad- vantage in shots on goal, 24-15. Though Dowling had the upper hand in ground balls, 34-29, and in face-off wins, 10-7. Senior goalkeeper made 10 saves for the Pioneers, while junior goalkeeper Myles Harvey made 15.
Post returns to Hickox Field Saturday, April 27, to take on Molloy College at noon.

A lot of people today use their Facebooks as a type of online “journal”, stating whatever comes to mind (no matter how rash it may be), and posting photographs of everything they do. When employers and their staff are exposed to each other’s private thoughts and photographs (which could potentially be inap- propriate), the work relationship may begin to disintegrate, leaving an unsuitable friendship between an employer and their employee, due to several reasons. Employees don’t usually ponder anything negative regarding a Facebook friendship with their employers, they just seek to friend request them so they can check out what they are like outside of work. It’s interesting to inquire such things, because people aren’t necessarily as they seem. Some employees just add their em- ployers to have an additional way to contact them in case they need to, which is fine, but e-mail would be a more professional way of doing so.
Some people view employee-employer Facebook friendships in a more positive way. Nicole Piro, freshman Math Education major, said, “I think that it’s okay for them [employees and their bosses] to be friends on Face- book because it can give more of a personal and friendly connection between the two.” This is a valid opinion, and a possibility, depending on the maturity level of the people involved, and what is being posted online. It gets messy, however, when one party begins to lose sight of the real- ity of their relationship, which should be maintained on a pro- fessional and work-based level.
When people are exposed to their employers in a more “natural” light, such as being friends on Facebook, their respect level has a higher chance of decreasing. By letting their employees’ treat or view them as a “friend”, it may subconsciously cause the employee to feel as though they don’t have to answer to the boss. This alters the balance between authorities and not, which may ultimately effect the cooperation of staff members. Once coopera- tion weakens, so does the com- pany/business. Employees will begin to slack and fool around, thinking it’s acceptable because they’re “friends” with their man- agers, and this could portray the company as unprofessional and inefficient.
These same negative ef- fects apply to when Professors, or even high school and middle school teachers, become Facebook friends with their students. Giving students the ability to key into their professor’s social life warps the correspondence of the classroom relationship, seeing their instructors as an “equal” rather than their superior.
I feel that it is less common for professors to befriend their students on Facebook in com- parison to employers accepting their employees’ friend requests, but even so it does happen. When I was in high school, a student stumbled upon one of my teach- ers’ Facebooks online. His profile picture that was displayed was inappropriate, featuring a mirror picture of himself without a shirt on. Although he wasn’t accepting students’ friend requests, per se, his reputation as a teacher was negatively impacted. Students didn’t view him as a professional, and therefore didn’t take him seriously.
It seems to be more common for people to become Facebook friends with their bosses. This even comes up in conversation with my coworkers at Abercrombie and Fitch from time to time, and the concept appears outlandish. Work and Facebook just don’t seem to mix. Some people see it as an opportunity to develop friendlier relation- ships with their authoritative figures, but does having them on Facebook cross a line? This is a common occurrence in part-time jobs for high school and college students, which isn’t such a big deal as they aren’t typically careers (stabilizing adult payments and lasting for a significantly larger number of years) for the employees, but are simply their outlet to gain experience and/or personal profit. Managers, on the other hand, do not benefit from losing their sense of leader- ship. In the real world, depend- ing on the business and sophistication of the workers, I don’t believe it to be colloquial that these Facebook relationships
are acceptable. It’s vital to know your place at work is distinctly incomparable to that of your social life, and that they belong separated.

Editors-in-Chief
Almost four years ago, on a scorching hot day at the end of August, I drove onto the C.W. Post campus.
It took me twenty minutes to figure out where I was supposed to park. College orientation was an overnight event where I knew close to no one; I was painfully shy throughout the whole experience and if you know anything about me, I’m not a very shy person.
The theme of “Orientation ‘09” was something along the lines of a theatre show, starring “me,” which actually, in my opinion, is quite ironic looking back on it. Because, if I’ve learned anything at Post for four years, it’s that nothing is just about you. It’s about other people; friends, professors, mentors, and bosses. Those are the individuals who help you evolve; and college is all about evolving. 
To be completely honest, my first two years were a slow evolution. As a commuter student, it’s so easy to fall into the trap of going to class and going home. I was a good student and I talked to my friends while I was here, but other than that I truly didn’t feel like Post meant anything to me. It wasn’t until I joined the Pioneer that I really began to understand that being a part of something bigger, something that in our own little world was even quite powerful, was so much more rewarding.
Walking into a meeting by yourself, especially when the office is ridiculously hard to find, can be somewhat intimidating. Taking that step, however, shaped the rest of my Post experience. It’s in that office that I met people who had the same visions as me and now, four years later, I consider them family. It’s there that I also met the Pioneer’s faculty advisor, Carolyn Schurr Levin, who became an excellent mentor, professor and even a friend.
Here at the Pioneer, I truly had the learning experience of a lifetime. As a journalism student, the ultimate goal of going to college is to learn the craft of good reporting. Classes were very helpful, don’t get me wrong, and I’m very appreciative for having had my share of dedicated professors who genuinely wanted to see me succeed.
But, it’s at the Pioneer where I learned the importance of a deadline (multiple Tuesday nights spent being in the office later than midnight put that into perspective real quick), the significance of fact checking, the magnitude of one wrong word; the extent of what true “good reporting” really is. I learned most of those things through mistakes, but I grew from them. I’ve learned that although many times, a reporter will be faced with hardships, such as lack of information and uncooperative sources, finding a way to deal with those roadblocks and publishing an accurately reported story, on deadline, is the most rewarding feeling in the world.
I’ve tried to lead by example and be as understanding and helpful as I could be to my staff. I’ve also, however, learned that I truly have so much more to learn, and that excites me more than being content with what I already do know. If I could leave behind a piece of advice, it’s to be skeptical. Don’t accept an answer just because someone tells you that’s how it is. Ask questions. And always be kind, because at the end of the day, we’re all human and kindness goes a long way.
It’s bittersweet leaving this publication behind but I’m more than confident that it’s in good hands. As last year’s Editor in Chief, Annie Winberry said, “Students, this is your soapbox. If you want your voice to be heard, this is the way to do it.” I encourage every student on campus to associate the Pioneer with being an outlet for his or her concerns.
Four years later, our school is no longer “C.W. Post,” I now know where to park, and other than leaving with just my Bach- elor’s degree, I leave with friends, memories and an incredible appreciation of journalism. I know why our orientation t-shirts said “starring me,” and now I know who “me” is. The show is no longer about me though, now, it’s about you.
– O.W.
My first day at Post is somewhat of a blur to me now, as I was only 16 years old. I do remember being absolutely petrified; on my own for the first time with no parents to make sure I was doing what I was supposed to. Now, I sit writing this five years later, staring graduation and adulthood right in the face.
To say that I have enjoyed my time here at Post (which in my mind will always have a C.W. in front of it) is an understatement. My underclassmen years were filled with learning from my mistakes; pushing deadlines to the limit, staying out too late, and doing the wrong thing regardless of my conscience telling me otherwise. Basically, your typical undergrad college experience.
It was my junior and senior years where I really made the most memories. I joined this newspaper staff at the end of my sophomore year and through these past two and a half years, this staff has become my family. Especially this year, these amazingly talented women, who I spend ten to eleven hours a day with putting the paper together, are some of the most incredible people I know. My co-Editor-in-Chief has become my illegitimate twin sister; I suppose that’s what happens when you spend as much time together as we do. However, I wouldn’t have it any other way.
I’ve gotten to do some pretty incredible things during my time here; seeing the only handwritten draft of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation firsthand, going to the presidential debate at Hofstra University for the school’s radio station, interning at Newsday and interviewing Miguel before his Spring Fling performance just to name a few.
As much as things have definitely changed on this campus since I started my education, and there are always things to complain about, I have loved just about every minute and would not change anything, except maybe the food at Winnick.
I won’t go on reminiscing anymore. For any underclassmen reading this, this is my advice to you: get involved and have the most fun as possible. I’m not telling you to neglect your schoolwork by any means but do anything and everything you can. Don’t skip homecoming or Spring Fling or pep rally.
I did for a few years and that’s one of my biggest regrets of my college career. First and foremost have fun; you have the rest of your life to work. This is not the time to make hard and fast decisions. This is the time to make mistakes and to learn from them and as cliché as it sounds, the time to find out who you are and what you want out of life. Enjoy this time because in the blink of an eye you will be saying your goodbyes to friends who have become your family.
For any seniors reading this, I hope you’re ready. We are at a precipice, we can either go left or right; either way the decisions we are making now are going to considerably shape our futures. I wont preach the typical “find a job” speech because to be com- pletely honest, I’m winging it right now. But, enjoy these last few days of classes and more importantly senior week! Good luck with all of your futures, go kill it!
– A.P.

Dear Olivia, Alex and the rest of this year’s Pioneer staff,
Congratulations on a job well done! This year, you have provided an important service to your fellow students and to the entire Post campus. You have informed, engaged and entertained them. You have chronicled life on campus with timely, interesting and relevant stories. Your weekly issues just kept getting better and better. You dealt with frustrations and adversity maturely and with a sense of humor. You didn’t let Hurricane Sandy, the theft of your layout com- puters, or the myriad other obstacles you faced stop you for even one week. You just kept going. You have exhibited all the qualities that it takes to be superior journalists – enthusiasm, tenacity, teamwork, fairness, and compassion. I’m sure that I am speaking for many others on campus when I gratefully thank you for your hard work and commitment.
Sincerely,
Carolyn Schurr Levin Faculty Advisor for the Pioneer

This is my last column ever. I hope you all have enjoyed my little rants for the past few years because I know I have enjoyed writing them and getting feedback from readers. Ok, so, after the spring fling concert I was hanging out around campus with a few friends. One of the boys started to go on about how girls ask boys “silly” questions and then get mad when they don’t get the response they were looking for. To give you an example, a girl is getting ready and asks a guy how she looks and he responds with a basic “fine.”
Wrong answer. “Fine.” I may as well just put on a moo moo if I wanted to just look fine. After he went on for a little bit, I posed the question, “Well, did you know what the appropriate answer
should have been to that question?” He said of course he did. Then why in the world didn’t you just come out with it? I understand that it’s silly that we repeatedly ask that question and questions like it, but we like to hear from our boyfriends that we look pretty. We’re not getting dressed for us; we’re trying to look nice for you. I would wear sweats everywhere I went if it were appropriate.
You boys don’t understand why we continually ask and we don’t understand why you don’t just respond correctly and save both of us the headache. It’s like when girls ask guys to do some- thing and an hour or two later we ask if you did it. Nine times out of ten you didn’t do it. God forbid we say that we’ll just do it, guys always respond, “No, no, no I got it.” You don “got it,” if you did you would have done it an hour ago when I asked you.
I suppose its just another reason why men and women seem to be from different planets; like we’re two completely different species.

Smartphones have become second nature to our generation. We were toddlers when our parents were getting their first cell phones; back when people were still using beepers. Technology has advanced so much in our life span that many students don’t know how they would live without it. Is our dependence on this technology a good or bad thing? Post students debate this question without a definite answer.
“It’s both good and bad,” said Danielle Weeks, a junior Music Performance major. “It is convenient and allows us to accomplish more, but it also makes our interactions with others worse.”
Weeks added that it’s convenient because you can send a quick text to a friend if you just want to say hi instead of going through the much longer process of mailing a letter (and really, when was the last time you sent anyone a letter?). However, she also said that people are worse at communicating in person as a result. After her statement she looked at the table in front of her and laughed because a laptop, Smartphone and iPad were spread out across the table in front of her and her friend.
This is the predicament that many students are finding them- selves in. Students can acknowledge the negatives of technology; although, they also realize that the convenience technology provides will cause it to be around forever.
“Most of the population has an iPhone. Our lives depend on it,” said Andre Amaro, a senior Political Science major, as he pointed out that every single one of his friends sitting around him had their iPhones sitting on the table in front of them while they were hanging out.
Amaro added that he is on his iPhone in every class. He feels that his life revolves around his phone and the information and social networking inside of it. His friends at the table were smiling at his confession and nodded their heads because they are guilty of the same thing.
Many students admit that Smartphones have some negative effects on their socialization while they are hanging out with their friends.
“We don’t talk when we eat. We are all just on our phones,” said Maria Kaloidas, a freshman who is undecided on her major. She laughed at how terrible it was, but she accepts the fact that this is the way it is.
Chris Schmidt, a senior Public Relations major, and his friends have picked up on their bad hab- its, so they made it into a game. “When we go out to eat, the first person who uses their phone pays the bill,” he said.
Anna Scheblein, an adult student who is a senior Sociology major and Journalism minor, recalls getting her first cell phone. “They weighed a ton, and were about the size of a landline’s handset,” she said.
“I think that this evolution in communication technology is a positive one, for the most part. It has allowed us to not only remain in touch with friends and family in distant places, but has also allowed us to connect with people we never would have had the opportunity to otherwise,” she added.
“However, one disadvantage may be that we sometimes don’t make enough time to connect socially face-to-face. A quick text, e-mail, or logging onto Facebook doesn’t lend itself to the one-on- one long lasting relationships built by physically engaging with some- one,” she adds.
Although Smartphones will most likely always be present in our lives, it doesn’t mean that we should ignore the negatives of technology. Be cognizant of how often you use your phone when you are having a face-to-face social interaction with someone else, make an initiative to have relationships that aren’t just digi- tal, and also make sure to have copies of everything you store digitally—you never know when your device will crash. Technology doesn’t live forever.

One hot trend this spring is ombrè, a style in which color graduates from light to dark. For example, a blue ombrè dress may be very pale green at top, but the fabric becomes deeper in color as it reaches the bottom hem. Ombrè can be seen in clothing, hair, and can be created with the use of nail polish.
Ombrè made its debut into the fashion world last spring and it’s back again. Last spring, this hot color fade also made its way into hair salons. Miley Cyrus, Lauren Conrad and Khloe Kardashian were among some of the celebrities that fell for the ombrè look last season. All were spotted with ombrè locks. They kept dark roots and gradually lightened the bottom of their hair. This spring, ombrè has worked its way into wardrobes. Stores such as Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, and Free People have numerous ombrè pieces, including t-shirts, denim, dresses, and handbags. These stores offer different price ranges for different shoppers. If you’re not looking to spend an obscene amount on new pieces for your spring wardrobe, start your ombrè shopping spree at Forever 21.
Sophomore Social Work major Emma Weinstein, is all about ombrè. “Last spring, I hopped on the ombrè hair band wagon,” she said. This season she is more about the ombrè fashion that designers have to offer. “Just the other day, I stopped into Urban Outfitters and bought a pair of purple denim ombrè shorts,” explained Weinstein.
Men’s fashion has also embraced the trend this season.
Designers such as Versace, Marc Jacobs and Kolor are now catering to men looking to rock the trend. Actor Johnny Depp has been seen rocking dark roots and light locks. Whether or not he was overdue for a dye job, he’s right on trend.
Junior Psychology major, Jason Kanyike, has yet to embrace the ombrè trend. However, he is not against it. “I think it’s a pretty cool look. If I come across a t-shirt that I like, then I would definitely buy it,” said Kanyike. He likes the fact that designers are embracing this trend for both sexes.
If you’re not looking to spend any money on ombrè fashion, you can become a DIY-er (do it yourself-er). There are many tutorials online that demonstrate how to turn your clothes from drab to fab. All you need to do is head into your laundry room and confiscate the bleach!
Check out this tutorial from YouTube!

Never more than one page, leave out unnecessary information, and god forbid – no typos. These are qualities that could catch the employer’s eye when looking at your resume. During the semester’s final Food For Thought lecture on April 16, three journalism professionals offered their expertise of do’s and don’ts when putting together job applications.
“Your resume is the most important piece of paper you’ll ever write,” said Bill Bleyer, a writer for Newsday, who was part of the Pulitzer Prize-winning team that covered the TWA Flight 800 crash in 1997. “Employers will lose interest and throw your resume in the trash if there are unnecessary mistakes,” he added.
Bleyer, along with Pam Robinson, Associate Regional Editor with Patch Huntingon, and Nicole B. Brewer, Executive Editor and Publisher for Hamptons.com, spoke about basic preparation techniques for finding a job in today’s challenging market.
The most effective resume should include and be arranged in the following order:
1. Your name and contact information; “I’ve seen resumes where people didn’t manage to spell their own names right, and that’s never a promising start,” Brewer said. “Also make sure to keep your contact information updated and your e-mail should sound professional, preferably it has your full name in it,” she added.
2. Objective: “Keep your objective very simple and concise. ‘Seeking an internship’ is enough,” Brewer said.
3. Experience: “List experience that is relevant to the internship and briefly explain what you did there,” Bleyer said. “If you worked at the Gap, list that, but cut out irrelevant job descriptions,” he added.
4. Education: List degrees, schools you’ve attended and add clubs, professional clubs, so- rorities, fraternities or volunteer work.
5. Skills: “Forget to write Microsoft Word, everyone knows that, and don’t claim to know Microsoft Office unless you do,” Brewer said. “Then I assume that you can build databases because that is part of Microsoft Office,” she said. “Language skills are great, but don’t over- estimate and say that you know Spanish fluently unless you do,” she added.
6. References: “Always ask the reference for permission first,” Robinson said. “I’ve had people calling, asking if I would recommend someone that I would not have recommended, which becomes awkward for me,” she added.
In addition, resumes should never be more than one page so that the reader does not lose interest. In the media industry, skills are im- portant, so be prepared to send links or actual copies of your work. “And remember, only work that you think is good enough, not all of your work,” Robinson said. Also keep in mind to start early; many summer internship applications should be done around Christmas. “At Newsday, we want them in as early as January,” Bleyer said.
Due to the lecture hall being double booked, the event ended early, but the speakers stuck around to offer advice and assist students who had brought their resumes with them.
“It was great to talk to professionals who helped me make changes that makes me attractive to employers when looking for a job,” said Maria Emdal Otterlei, a junior Broadcasting major. “I have taken LIU Post’s Coopera- tive Education EEE-1 Seminar, a non-credit course where you learn to write resumes, and they taught me very differently. I guess what I learned today applies much better to the field I want to work in,” she added.
Senior Journalism major Jazlyn Beltre, interned with Viacoms TV Land Digital and was offered a freelance position, but still agreed that her resume could be improved. “I learned that I repeat obvious things to make it look like I have more experience, and sometimes have to change the font to fit everything in,” she said. “I learned that less is really more,” she added.

A myriad of short films debuted at the Tribeca Film festival this year. Varying from documentaries, to animations, to twenty-minute dramas, there have been many rich selec- tions. Here are just a few that premiered.
Film: “RPG OKC” Written and Directed by Emily Carmichael Language: English Country: USA This quirky and modern animated short film shares the unlikely romance (through the internet) of two video game characters from very different worlds. “RPG OKC,” sweet and humorous, is particularly enjoyable to anyone who has played a video game or read “Romeo and Juliet.” Writer/Director Emily Carmichael has screened films at festivals such as Sun- dance, SXSW and Tribeca. She will tackle her first feature film project this year.
Film: “A Short Film About Guns” Directed by Minos Papas Language: English Country: USA, UK
Minos Papas unveils an unsettling short docu- mentary examining the function of the illegal arms trade around the world. Interplaying informative interviews from experts on the illegal arms trade and eye opening images of weaponry in use around the globe, “A Short Film About Guns” highlights the compla- cency of those who only speak of taking action against this global problem. At a time where the legality and handling of small weaponry is a popular social topic, this short documentary encapsulates the severity of the situation.
Film: “Good Bread” Directed by Eddie Schmidt Language: English Country: USA As part of the “Focus Forward: Food for Thought” series at Tribeca, Eddie Schmidt’s short documentary on the assimilation of ex- gang members into the workforce is a brief yet enlightening morsel of an experience. At Homeboy Industries, we see the nurturing process of those willing to rejoin the world and learn a unique sense of unity and friendship.
Film: “Likeness” Written and Directed by Diego Prieto Language: English Country: USA Rodrigo Prieto’s first-time directing effort glistens with the influence of his career as a cinematographer. Having worked on projects with the likes of Martin Scorsese, Ang Lee and Alejandro González Iñárritu, Prieto is commanding in his surreal vision of the teen-age psyche. Elle Fanning plays an insecure teenager who feels the pressure to be skinny, and whose mind is the core of the film. Clock- ing in at only six minutes, “Likeness” devotes half of that time to a brilliantly nauseating sequence of what appears to be a super model party. There is a sensation of glamour and pain there; melting away as frail bodies drape themselves over furniture and drift through the party in a state of catatonic ecstasy. Short but meaningful, “Likeness” is a highlight of the festival.
Film: “Fear of Flying” Written and Directed by Conor Finnegan Language: English Country: Ireland “Fear of Flying” is one of the most light-hearted shorts at the festival this year. Animating with cloth animals, Finnegan delivers a relatable story of a bird that is afraid of flying, and consequently tries to stick out the winter in his home. How is this relatable? The film delves into themes of alienation, fear and humble love, as the protagonist prepares himself for the inevitability (in this case, flying) of his life.

When one attends an art show, he or she expects to see paintings or framed masterpieces. However, what if there was an art show that went beyond a simple picture framed on a wall? What if the canvas consisted of live models instead? LIU Post art student Jesus Modesto will do just that in his senior art show titled, “Beyond the Superficial,” at 5 p.m. on May 1. The show will take place in the
Sculpture Studio, which is lo- cated in the south area of the Post campus located near the intramural field and the music rehearsal building.
Modesto, an Art Education major, decided to go above and beyond for his senior art show. He believes that although the simple two-dimensions of a regular canvas could grab attention for his artwork, this live action element is an even better way to display it. With this art show, Modesto hopes to better the reputation of the LIU
Post art department as well. According to an interview from an online press release, Modesto said that he is hoping to “break away from the traditional photographs, paintings and sculp- tures that make up typical art shows.”
Modesto plans to use models who will wear his artwork. It is not a fashion show however; these models simply act as canvases for his artwork.
“My show is on the human anatomy. They [the models] will have muscles and organs and such that are created,” said Modesto.
Art is known as a unique way to look at life. When artwork is showcased through a simple can- vas or a sculpture, it may not truly capture the three-dimensional nature of life. With models and the organs painted on them, LIU Post student Jesus Modesto is able to capture life through the best source possible…people. Not only is his artwork a fresh way to look at life, but it also is beyond the superficial.

LIU Post’s Newman Club, a part of the catholic community, hosted this year’s Day of Silence event on Thursday, April 18. Day of Silence is a national event that calls to awareness discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in schools.
Students of all ages take a vow of silence to encourage schools and peers to address the problem of anti gay/lesbian behavior. The silence illustrates the effect of bullying and harassment on students, according to the LGBT Community and the Newman Club.
Erik Raessler, a senior Physics major and former president of the Newman Club, explained that the Newman club is an open- minded organization.
The club wants to stand up for social issues, and create awareness and solidarity. The Catholic community tends to be more conservative about the gay and lesbian community, so the fact that the club, which is Catholic, chose to host this day was a bit contradictory, Raessler said. He noted that hosting the Day of Silence was Father Ted Brown’s idea, and then it was discussed at several meetings after that.
Often on this day, you’ll see people with duct-tape on their mouths, and Raessler said he saw a couple of people with their mouths sealed. However, since students are often forced to speak when they’re in college, it’s more difficult to do it that way, he said. “It’s usually the kids who did it in high school who’ll do it in college as well.”
Sixty-three people signed up for the event this year. They tried to get a speaker to come talk to Post students. However, the speaker, whom they didn’t name, cancelled and they didn’t have enough time to find somebody else. They tried to gather a few people to eat lunch on the Great Lawn in silence, but due to the bad weather and busy schedules, not that many students showed up.
Erik Palacios, a junior Biology major, said, “I think it’s a good way of showing people about the LGBT Community and other people who are too scared to speak out about who they really are.”
This year’s planning of the event, according to Sally-Ann Gaughan, a Newman club member and a senior Early Childhood Education major, is a skeleton for next year’s event, as this year’s didn’t turn out as they hoped it would. The members are going to try to start planning it during the fall, and hopefully, she said, it will be a success.

LIU Post’s Social Work Department hosted the second annual Family and Domestic Violence Conference in Hillwood Commons. The daylong event was made up of several workshops and presentations where speakers educated the audience on domestic violence and other forms of aggression as well as other risks and steps one can take to prevent an assault.
Michelle Garcia, the director of the Stalking Resource Center in Washington D.C., shared facts, sta- tistics and signs of stalking. Stalking is a pattern of behavior directed toward a specific person that may cause a person to be fearful.
Some of the facts on stalking from the National Institution of Justice Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention include: over one million Americans are stalked each year, those aged from 18 to 24 experience the highest rate of stalking and the rates on a college campus are higher. Also, the majority of victims know their stalker. The most common stalking behavior is unwanted phone calls and/or messages, at 66 percent over all other forms. Almost all stalking via technology is through the use of cell phones at almost 80 percent.
The Keynote Speaker was Ted Bunch, co-founder and co-director of A Call to Men, an organization that works to create a world where all men and boys are loving and respectful and all women and girls are valued and safe, according to the website.
Bunch spoke about daily dangers women face on the street, as well as domestic violence against women. Bunch is recognized both nationally and internationally for his skill in educating men in the effort of creating a healthier and more respectful manhood. Bunch is dedicated to ending all forms of violence and decimation against women.
Bunch shared facts and statis- tics about assault with the audience. Bunch states that women often defend themselves in ways men would never have to think about. When Bunch asked the audience how they protect them- selves, one woman said, “When I’m leaving work at night and I am alone, I put my keys in between my knuckles; in case someone comes behind me and tries to attacks me, I can defend myself.”
Bunch also shared a story of one woman’s safety measure. This woman would lock herself out as she brought the garbage to the trash, and unlock the door when she was finished so no one would sneak into her house. Bunch then asked the men how many of them have ever thought to do such a thing when they are alone; none of the men in the audience raised their hand.
Domestic violence is the number one health risk for women, according to Bunch’s research. Bunch showed a video interview that A Call to Men conducted. Ten men were interviewed and asked what they would do if they witnessed a man hit his girlfriend. All of the men said “Mind my own business.” Some even said, “She may have had it coming.” When the same men were asked what they would do if it was a stranger hitting a woman he did not know, they responded with, “Then maybe I’d do something.” Bunch said that this is because women are viewed as “property.”
Ashley Walsh, a sophomore Computer Science major, attended this year’s event and was very surprised by the lecture. “Originally, I only attended this conference as extra credit for my sociology class. However, after seeing the various workshops and presentation, I was actually interested and alarmed by the statistics and facts,” Walsh stated.
Organizations such as A Call to Men work in fighting off all dangerous risks towards women by bringing awareness to the issue of domestic violence and various forms of assault.

On Sunday, April 14, students and faculty members had the opportunity to attend Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated’s 13th annual cancer banquet to show support for and gain more knowledge of Childhood Cancer.
Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated (OPBSI) is a non-profit organization that serves and educates people of diverse backgrounds through sisterhood, leadership, and guidance. As positive role models, they promote unity of all cultures, focus on the empowerment of women and raise the standards of excel- lence in one’s academic, so- cial, and personal endeavors. The Epsilon chapter of Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated has been empowering women for 20 years at Long Island University: Post Cam- pus. These women focus on bringing our campus and community together by pro- moting awareness on issues that affect our society.
The Epsilon Chapter hosts an annual cancer ban- quet to advocate and bring awareness; the night commemorated childhood cancer. Sponsorships, individual donations and proceeds were donated to The Cancer Center for Kids at Winthrop University Hospital located in Mineola. The Winthrop’s Cancer Center for Kids is the largest outpatient facility for treating children with cancer and blood disorders in Nassau County.
“Malcolm McDaniel, a senior Speech Pathology major, said, “I loved attending the cancer banquet and seeing Epsilon chapter sisters, old and new, come together for a great cause.”
Senior, Childhood Edu- cation major, Kristy Neimeyer, agreed, “ I absolutely loved the cancer banquet. I think it’s a great way for students to dress up and become aware of an important cause while supporting our student leaders.”
Cathy Shimmel, a nurse at the center spoke diligently about the programs efforts to treat patients. Shimmel stated, “Patients can receive transfusions, infusions, chemotherapy treatments, or even procedures under anes- thesia in a safe and comforting environment…and then go home to sleep in their own beds at night.” Shimmel closed her speech with a heartfelt story of a patient who wanted a Princess Barbie.
The child wanted to feel like a Barbie, but could not relate to the toy, due to hair loss from chemotherapy. The program then organized a partnership to distribute “Bald Princess Barbies.”
The evening was filled with wonderful entertain- ment addressing the devastation of children with cancer. Performers included R.A.W. (Rebellious Assertive Writers) members of Lambda Sigma Upsilon Fraternity, Incorporated who shared personal poems of a mother loosing her child and contemporary dances by Post Concert Dance Company.
According to the American Cancer Society, a total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. The Epsilon Chapter of Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated would like to thank all who attended and supported the event.
Crystal Lopez, a sister of the Epsilon chapter of Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated, said, “We are very happy with the turnout. We hope to get more students involved and look forward to new ways to execute our purpose.”

If I had a nickel for every time someone “borrowed” money and didn’t pay me back, I’d be set for life. Frequently, people will put you on the spot for money, even as little as a dollar, with no intention of actually paying back. The word “borrow” (verb) is defined as : to take or obtain with the promise to return the same or an equivalent. Yet, many people don’t honor the promise to return, and end up mooching off of their friends. This happens everywhere, including here on LIU Post’s campus.
Personally, when I borrow money, I make sure that I will be receiving money soon and tell my friend whom I am borrowing from when I will be able to get it back to them. When lending money, I try and remember the people who have paid me back in the past. If it’s a prior offender,
I make sure that I have their phone number in case they don’t follow through. It’s as much my fault as it is theirs if I never see that money again. It’s important to be responsible for your funds, and to know whom you can trust, and to treat all new borrowers as though they may not give it back, because you never know how people are.
Another instance is when people forget they even borrowed the money; this could get messy, especially if they claim to have paid you back. Be sure to be keen on reminding them to get you the money back as soon as possible, that way you can refer back to your reminders if they attempt to claim they had
already paid you back. Whether they are pretending, or actually believe they already paid their dues, you may never see that money again. It’s better to be annoying and repetitive about it than to be shy and allow people to steal from you.
Don’t be unnecessarily persistent, but know when you should speak up. As a borrower, ensure that your friend seems comfortable with lending. Even if they say yes, if they appear hesitant, then maybe it isn’t a good idea. Sometimes people feel uncomfortable when they’re put on the spot, but don’t nec- essarily want to contribute to your payments. It’s also important to know your boundar- ies with friends; if you’re aware you hadn’t paid a friend back, try and get to it. It’s better late than never, and chances are your friend hasn’t forgotten. You don’t want to take advantage of people, especially regarding money, because they may not want to spend time with you if they feel you’re using them.
Try to avoid having to bor- row money in the first place. If the purchase is not entirely crucial, you should put it off until you can cover it yourself. Bor- rowing will lead to the hassle and stress of having to pay your friend back in a timely fashion, and you don’t want to feel in debt with a friend. Not to mention, if they feel like you’re not going to pay them back, it could place a strain on your friendship.
Be careful with how you manage your commerce, whether lending or borrowing, because, if gone about the wrong way, you could land yourself in a tight or uncomfortable situation.

The inspiration behind this article was the detainment of the initial suspect of the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday, April 15. According to the New York Post, a Saudi immigrant of the name Abdul Rahman Ali Al-Harbi, was the first suspect detained (the Boston police commissioner, how- ever, denied having any suspects in custody). The Post claims that a civilian at the scene thought Al-Harbi was acting suspiciously, so he captured him and turned him in to the Boston Police. During his stay at the hospital due to injuries, Al-Harbi was guarded, his apartment was searched, and his roommate was questioned.
Later, it was discovered that Al-Harbi is in fact innocent. Some of the questions that remain unanswered are whether his (apparently fictional) detainment can be justified, and whether the New York Post’s communication of this false information serves to implicate race and religion with the profiling of potential terror suspects.
Kaitlyn Donofrio, a sopho- more History Education major, was in opposition to Al-Harbi’s supposed arrest. She believes it is a form of discrimination because the justice system asserts that “you are innocent until proven guilty.” Moreover, there was no firm evidence that indicated his involvement, and so it appears that he was arrested simply because of his race or religion. Steven Corina, a junior Elementary Education major, said that “they should take what the [civilian] said into consideration, but they shouldn’t arrest [Al-Harbi] or search his apartment.”
Furthermore, Zach Barnett, a senior Adolescent Education ma- jor, insisted that, “they shouldn’t have [detained him] because that’s racial profiling, and it’s wrong.” In fact, racial profiling is illegal as a result of the 4th and 14th Amendments as well as the Civil Rights Act. Regardless, racial profiling still exists, targeting specific groups such as Mexicans or African Americans for crimes involv- ing drugs, Hispanics for being illegal immigrants, and Arabs and Muslims as the cause of terrorist attacks.
This could possibly be the result of the media’s persistence in highlighting certain characteristics of criminals. Donofrio reflects that the media “ties terrorism to religion” and is constantly depicting “Arabs as the ‘bad guys.’” “Don’t call them ‘Islamist’ terrorists,” states Donofrio, “so people don’t associate the religion with terror- ism.” Donofrio also mentions that “if there was a Catholic terrorist, I wouldn’t want to be feared just because I am also Catholic.”
Michelle Aranella, a sophomore Math major, said, “The news shouldn’t mention color, race or religion so people don’t become afraid of those people,” Aranella said. “Specifying racial information would cause uneducated people [to] believe these wrong assumptions.”
This “creates hatred and fear,” said Danielle Aranella, a sopho- more Childhood Education major.
“We live in a country where we are made to fear,” Donofrio declared. “This results in hatred, which in turn leads to (more) acts of violence.”
“What if it was a white person?” Donofrio asks. She, along with M. Aranella and D. Aranella, agreed that the media depicts a White terrorist as an individual isolated from American society who, in the majority of cases, suf- fers from some type of mental illness. They indicate how the media
does not mention the race or religion of White American criminals.
David Sirota, in his Salon. com article “Let’s hope the Bos- ton Marathon bomber is a white American,” emphasized this double-standard and so-called “white privilege.” He alleges that, “White terrorists are dealt with as lone wolves, [whereas] Islamists are existential threats.” No labels are placed on White Americans. However, all Muslims across the globe must suffer under the brand name of “Islamist terrorists.” A simple Google search about terror attacks in the U.S. will confirm M. Aranella’s statement that, “terrorists come from everywhere.”
The solution? “Be open-minded,” says D. Aranella. Be able to distinguish racism from plain facts and don’t take everything you hear at face value. Most importantly, don’t link bad characteristics to a particular group of people. Donofrio reminds us that “the main idea of all religions is to be a good person,” so don’t allow anyone to “use their religion as the excuse of doing something bad.” Finally, as Emerson puts it, “live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse.”

The Pioneer recently spoke with Nick Mery about his new album, “Gentlemen Streets,” which will be released on April 26. Mery wrote, recorded and performed every song on this album, which features 10 new tracks. As an independent artist, Mery released seven albums, two through iTunes and five available for free download, licensed six songs to CBS and charted in the Top 25 Acoustic Artists on Garageband.com. In addition, he was nominated twice for “Best Original Song” in the Feel Good Film Festival.
In addition to “Gentlemen Streets,” Mery will also debut a free EP for download simultaneously entitled, “The Blue Dog EP.” Both records will be released via Mery’s label Plaidcore Records. “Gentlemen Streets” will be available exclusively on iTunes, and “The Blue Dog EP” will be available through his BandCamp page on April 26. You can follow Mery on Twitter @MeryKid.
The Pioneer (TP): “Gentlemen Streets” will be released on April 26. How did you choose the album title?
Nick Mery (NM): The album title was chosen to reflect my state of mind, being 27 and trying to embrace growing up. I think a lot of people in entertainment have begun using their careers to stay forever young, as if being older and more mature is somehow a bad thing. “Gentlemen Streets” is my proc- lamation that growing up isn’t such a bad thing! Fittingly, April 26 is my birthday, so it’s just another step towards finding myself within the madness of this beautiful planet.
TP: You completely wrote, recorded and performed every song on the album. What was it like taking such a big behind the scenes role?
NM: Being completely in control of a project is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, if it all goes right, you get all of the glory! And on the other hand, if (and when) something inevitably goes wrong, that comes down completely on your shoulders as well. I’ve always been a control freak when it comes to my music, mostly because there’s so little money involved in being an independent artist that the real payoff comes from seeing your vision come to life. I take my albums very seriously. Once the process of the writing is finished, however, I place a lot of pressure on a very select group of friends/fans/collaborators almost like a focus group to tell me every good and bad thing they think about it, before put- ting my final stamp of approval on it. Finding the right balance of criticism for your project is a healthy, and necessary, step towards releas- ing a quality product.
TP: Which of the new 10 tracks is your favorite and why?
NM: This is a hard question. It’s like asking which of my ten fingers is my favorite finger. I like all of my fingers! From the perspective of an album, each song is necessary for the ebb-and-flow of the experience, so without any song I don’t think it would be the same. However, with that being said, I believe “True” is my favorite song to have written. From a production standpoint, it’s the song that I feel pushed my abilities the furthest. It’s my super-saiyan track.
TP: The electronic-pop album showcases your best in the hip-hop and R&B genres. How did you find a balance between this variety?
NM: One of my favorite quotes from the show “Scrubs” was, “It’s a hip-hop world,” spoken from the mouth of a very old, wrinkly doctor. This is something I couldn’t agree with more. Hip-hop has positioned itself as the most influential genre in pop culture, partnering with the ever-expanding technol- ogy of audio recording equipment, sound manipulation and social networking. At this point in my career, I’ve released folk records, psychedelic albums, concept records about space and a punk record. This was a frontier I had yet to experience, and found it extremely fulfilling. My foray into R&B is just a choice to focus on singing (since I couldn’t rap myself out of a paper bag) over electronic soundscapes. Artists like Frank Ocean and The Weeknd have recently given new life to the genre of R&B, making it exciting again.
TP: As an independent artist, you have released seven albums [two through iTunes, five available for free download]. How has this business model worked for you?
NM: It depends on the perspective of success. I’ve had people from all over the world contact me, write about my music, especially from earlier YouTube videos I released. I once wrote a blog post about a vin- tage keyboard that I used to record on one of my albums, and people still to this day offer to buy it from me. So I feel like my music has connected me to a lot of humans that would not, in any other circumstance, be reaching out to me. Monetarily, it’s not an overwhelmingly successful venture! There are instances from time to time where something pays off substantially, but the music industry still relies very heavily upon familiarity, when it comes to investment. You either need to know someone in charge, or you need to sound like someone who knows someone in charge.
TP: Where do you find your inspiration?
NM: A lot of my inspiration comes from technology. At a certain point, when I’ve got a movie playing on a big TV, music playing, instruments buzzing, and lights flickering around me, I feel like I’m plugged in to the experience of electricity. I was struck by lightning once, so maybe a little bit of the energy was transferred to me.
TP: What advice do you have for college students who want to get ahead or break into the business?
NM: In all honesty, I would tell them don’t jump into it expecting the money to come first. If you’re looking for an immedi- ate payout, then you will have to shamelessly copy of-the-moment trends, which means your payout will end as soon as “the moment” is finished. Anybody can make YouTube videos of Top 40 songs and hope to be the next Justin Bieber, but creating something that’s meaning- ful, with substance, is what most people forget about art. Art is a being itself, one that needs contribution of the artist’s soul to exist.
TP: Tell us about one of your YOLO (you only live once) moments.
NM: I was born in the great year of 1985. Luckily, my moment is still happening.
