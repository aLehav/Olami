Dear Readers,
As an ‘old fox’ preparing for Pioneer retirement, I would like to take this opportunity to address recent events concerning our university as a whole, and The Pioneer in particular. On Friday, Dec. 2, I got to meet with President Kimberly Cline, along with three of her fellow administrative members. It was an interview planned on my part, and well received on theirs—a friendly chat with some valuable substance and minor disagreements.
However, since I was urged to turn off my recorder before the start of the interview (a method extensively used by journalists who want to get the facts right), and most of the conversation was asked by the interviewees to be held off record (in other words, the information discussed I am not allowed to forward your way), there ultimately wasn’t much news-worthy to report on.
The Pioneer will continue to strive for fair and balanced reporting, and will follow up on the leads given at the meeting. I apologize on my behalf for stealing valuable time off a busy university president’s schedule to no direct outcome, but believe the discussion may lead to a ‘greater good’ moving forward.

Public safety officer Rosemary Spitaleri is retiring on Dec. 31 after 35 years at Post. Spitaleri began her career in the custodial department but then applied to a position in the public safety office and was accepted for the job in 1988.
“My favorite thing about working here is the summer time; it’s usually a little slower,” she said. “Years ago, we used to have lunch together and it was always nice. The people I met here are like my second family.” During her time at Post, Spitaleri also used to play on the police departmemt softball league in which she was the only woman who signed up to play. She describes it as one of the best times during her career.
After Spitaleri retires, she hopes to spend her time traveling, visiting family she hasn’t seen in a long time and also spending time with her grandchild in Pennsylvania. Spitaleri also plans to visit South Dakota to see Mount Rushmore.
“I’m going to miss all the students and faculty and the people I’ve met and worked with over the years, and all the interaction,” Spitaleri said. “I loved working here and I’m glad I was able to do my job, but now it’s time for me to move on.”

After a 29-year lifespan, the HYMN public sculpture on the hill in front of the Chapel on the east side of campus is being restored.
Originally a street art response to a violent Howard Beach racial incident in 1986, the sculpture moved from its original location overlooking the Grand Central Parkway in Queens, NY, and found a home on the grounds of C.W. Post with partial funding from the African People’s Organization in 1987. In late October, the face from the HYMN went missing, a discovery made by a group of scavenger hunting students and some faculty. Only the plexiglass remained.
The sculpture was a collaboration between graffiti artist John Fekner, and intermedia artist Brian Albert. It is embedded in the ground, a sandwich of white plexiglass, a photo transfer sheet of Martin Luther King Jr.’s face, and a clear plexiglass on top, all lit from wiring underneath the face.
The piece can be viewed at night while passing the Chapel on University Drive. Due to its position, the sculpture does not receive much foot traffic or attention. After 29 years of peacefully resting on the hillside, the sculpture has been worn down by the elements.They [the artists] didn’t build it to last, they built it for immediate impact,” said Barbara Applegate, director of the Steinberg Museum of Art and leader of the restoration process. “So they are excited for the opportunity to make it last.”
In cooperation with Facilities Servic- es, Applegate plans to have the piece reinstalled before winter sets in and the ground freezes. Circulating around campus, among students, faculty, and administrators alike, were rumors and fingers pointing the blame: student vandalism, administrative intervention, fraternity organization, and more.
“I really can’t speak to that, I really have no idea,” Applegate said. Reportedly, the face was found a few days later by members of the Facilities department on the ground about 50 feet from the sculpture, undamaged. Applegate and Facilities Services staff believe the wind lifted the plexiglass and carried the photo transfer away. “The fact that nobody really damaged it, leads to that idea,” Applegate said.
Despite the expedient recovery, the face was not immediately returned to the sculpture, and for a few weeks, the rumors continued to spread.
“I heard from Barbara that students were upset it wasn’t restored,” Albert said. “It’s very hard, it seems, to get things done that are out of the norm.”
Prioritizing public arts is difficult, and Albert credits the progression of the restoration process to “whoever was being a pain in the butt” to the services.
“We are honored that the students are paying attention to it and want it to be in good condition,” Albert said. “It is quite a compliment,” he added.
Several attempts to restore the piece have taken place, but were postponed, once in October due to heavy rain, and again in November due to issues with the electrical wiring of the piece.
“We are working with [one of] the artist on some of the lighting,” said Bill Kirker, director of Facilities Services. “Once that is done we will schedule to replace it.”
Albert and Fekner have reconstructed the piece for permanence and to withstand the elements for years to come.
The Home Depot brand light bulbs are to be replaced with strips of waterproof LED lighting sandwiched between plastic, to last 25 to 50 years, and the white and clear plexiglass will be replaced with polycarbonate, a bulletproof plexiglass, and coated in nautical silicone to shield it from rainwater. Remaining is a safe power source to connect the sculpture to. “I want it to look like his [MLK’s] energy is emanating from the earth,” Albert said.
Fekner reminded viewers of the piece of its overall message. “With all the struggles going on, socially, racially, all the things within the nation—this is to promote the peace,” he said.
Continuing, “‘I have a dream,’ is still ongoing, and as artists we have to keep the spirit and thought of MLK moving.”

“I am not particularly interested in getting a good job, I want a good life, where I am happy as a human being,” Jeffrey Kane, LIU’s Vice President for Academic said when announcing that he plans to step down from his position in August.
Kane wasVice President for Academic Affairs in 2002 and since then has overseen the university’s academic operations and initiatives across all of LIU’scampuses. His final day in the position will be Aug. 31, 2017.
Kane has a bachelor’s degree in education from Queens College, a master’s degree in early childhood education/elementary education from Adelphi University and a doctorate in philosophy of education in the area of epistemology of science from New York University. Kane is an active and vocal scholar, writing and publishing on the philosophy of knowledge and educational policy.
“Educate me in a way that is meaningful,” Kane said. “That is what I wanted to do. This is why I have been interested in student centered education. I much rather say, how do you see the world? Let’s develop it, let’s explore it. “
Kane believes it is much more important to work with students and figure out how they see the world As the university’s chief academic officer, he has been able to apply his knowledge. He has spent a lot of time navigating the complexity of the institution, but now he believes it is time for him to do what he loves and write his books.
“I have been able to do it partially here but not how I want. Institutions are much more complex and require a lot more [time], which makes it harder [to write],” Kane said.”
After August,he plans to write while also traveling with his wife Janet, to whom he has been married for 43 years. Their plans include trips to Japan, Bali and Israel. He plans to use these travel experiences for his books.
“Life is finite and I want to do what I really want to do. I want my kids to look at my books and say wow, look what my dad has done,” Kane said.
Kane doesn’t plan on resting.He believes he has given his all to the university and he cares about every single student.But he has much more to accomplish outside of campus.
“In my view, the new senior vice president for academic affairs will have very large shoes to fill,” said Nardy O. Madera, who has worked with Kane as his administrative assistant for years.

Next year, the Global MBA program is taking off, beginning in the fall semester. The program is a 36-credit, one-year program and offers courses at business schools in three different countries on three different continents. The year is split between Fundan University in China’s largest city Shanghai, University of Cambridge in England and Post.
Mr. Gregory Wagner, senior associate for graduate recruitment at the College of Management, explains that the thought behind the program is to “help to attract a more diverse, well qualified group of students who want to expand the scope of their learning to include two of the top schools in the world.”
Wagner also believe the program will help improve the image of the university. “This [the program] will help brand LIU-Post as a center for intellectual curiosity and better able to attract students from all over the world for their MBA.”
Fundan University is one of the top-ranked universities in China, and spending about one month there will leave students with enriching experiences from one of manufacturer centers of the world, Wagner explains.
About ten weeks are then spent at Cambridge, which is one of the top-ranked universities worldwide, and “one of the intellectual centers of the world,” according to Wagner, before returning back to New York, “the business capital of the world.”
It is obvious that the characteristics of the places combined with highly ranked universities is the main selling point and that the hope is that this will give students the competitive edge on the job market.
Asking Wagner about who it is aimed at, he said, “It is open to students interested in getting an MBA with a global scope, who want to get out of their comfort zone and learn in a experiential setting.” He continued, “It’s a very exciting new program and we welcome all LIU students to explore the program. They are welcome to talk to me or speak with Dean Rob Valli.”

Students gathered around in Hillwood Commons during common hour on Tuesday, Nov. 29, to participate in pet therapy. The program, sponsored by Bidawee, a pet welfare organization, brings therapy dogs to campus. 
The idea behind pet therapy is to provide students with a way to relieve their stress from pre-finals and end of the semester workload. The pet therapy dogs were more than thrilled to have so many students petting them and giving them affection.

Every semester college students are faced with a familiar and formidable foe: finals week. Now just under two weeks away, students of all majors are gearing up for the final push to academic freedom, a highly anticipated and much needed winter break. So, what are the best ways students can ensure themselves a strong finish to the semester?
Here are five major tips on how to get through finals week on an academic high note.
Tip #1: Avoid Cramming; Sleep is Essential
Procrastination is directly related to poor time management, according to various studies. Since finals week is looming, start looking over your notes now, not two to three days before your test. Don’t believe it? Well, in 2012 the UCLA Department of Psychiatry and Bio-behavioral Sciences conducted a study on the relationship between study and sleep.
In the study, researchers found that “study time became increasingly associated with more academic problems, because longer study hours generally meant fewer hours of sleep. In turn, that predicted greater academic problems the following day.” In essence, too much studying without an adequate amount of sleep is detrimental to students. Formulating a quality plan of action to getting the grade you want on your final is simple—set up a 10-day plan. Manage your daily schedule to adequately fit two to three hours of studying while achieving at least six to eight hours of sleep a night. You’ll feel less tired, less anxious, and your body will likely not betray you with illness or fatigue prior to your test date.
Tip #2: Find a Quiet Place for Study
If you ever wondered why the librarian sprints 40 yards down a library hallway to ensure and maintain silence, well, here’s why: In a TedX Talk, Julian Treasure, a sound expert, spoke to an audience on how sound affects the human psyche and work productivity. Treasure found that human beings are “66 [percent] less productive in an open plan office” environment. How could that be?
Treasure stressed that in order to maintain focus and maximize work potential, humans— in this case students—need a calm, silent environment. Park yourself in a quiet spot to study, the campus library, study hall, or a college dormitory room all to yourself.
Tip #3: Chew Gum While Studying
Did you know that chewing gum acts as a stimulant for the brain? According to LiveScience.com, researchers at St. Lawrence University found that “chewing motion gets blood flowing to the brain where it improves memory, according to how quickly a test-taker can recall information in the lab.”
This phenomenon is called “mastication-induced arousal,” and can help provide a slight edge when it comes to memorizing that quick history fact or that ever-so complicated calculus formula.
Tip #4: Be Honest With Yourself, Extra-Help Makes a Difference
Phone a friend, phone home, ask a professor, go to the writing center—this list can go on and on. If you feel that you’re lagging in a particular aspect of a course, look for solutions. Professors are more than willing to sit down with you for the extra 5-10 minutes after class to explain a theory or a fact to you. They welcome student visits during their office hours. If that doesn’t do it for you, the writing center is free of charge. All it takes is an appointment or in some cases just a walk-in Q&A session.
Tip #5: Be Your Best Asset, Not Your Worst Enemy
Attention millennials: If you fail to prepare, then you should be prepared to fail, as Benjamin Franklin said. We can’t be anymore straightforward. Drop your phone, log-out of Facebook, deactivate your Instagram and hit the books. Social media surfing can be tempting.
Yes, those pictures from last winter break are always fun to look through, but will they help you pass biology? No. It’s time to get down to business, your friends will be there on the other side of finals week.
Don’t hold yourself back from achieving the grades you deserve. Sit down, focus, study and embrace the challenge of finals week, because if you don’t, it’s worth noting that winter courses are not covered by standard tuition fees.

“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” –U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights
The First Amendment is increasingly being called into question on college campuses, including within our own Long Island University network. A community’s response to issues sets the precedent for future generations. New generations learn by example; if X is permitted, then it must be lawful/fair/good. In light of recent events on campus, what are we teaching the next generation about the First Amendment?
The semester began with protests at LIU Brooklyn against a faculty lockout over contract negotiations. Students and faculty exercised their First Amendment rights to peacefully protest against the administration, and petition for a redress of grievances. Thank- fully, contract negotiations were temporarily extended and classes resumed at LIU Brooklyn.
However, moving forward does not necessarily translate to moving on. The lockout left many dismayed and angry at the fact that it even happened. Students were abuzz with the news. The LIU Brooklyn Student Coalition protested at an Oct. 18 Board of Trustees meeting that was relocated at the last minute. Needless to say, there was speculation as to the cause; perhaps it was to silence the students’ voices.
Simultaneously at Post, The Pioneer learned of budget cuts that would directly affect the paper’s ability to print; its only cost is printing. On Nov. 2, The Pioneer ran a full-page ad asking readers to help keep the paper alive. Of course, one response is “online does not mean dead.” But, on this campus it just might.
Students grab the paper in Hillwood Commons while waiting to purchase lunch or on the way into the library; the readership is predominantly based on print. Thus, it follows that moving the paper online would directly result in decreased readership.
If it were to happen, this would be the first academic year in the paper’s 60-year history without a print copy. The predicament begs the question, what precedent are we setting for the next generation?
Every major university and college has a student newspaper not only for journalism students to practice their art, but also to keep the student body abreast of local news. While the Pioneer would be able to serve that purpose if it was to transition online, it serves said purpose better as a print publication.
To say that the Post administration is attempting to limit First Amendment rights would be a gross miscalculation of logic; the claim lacks evidentiary support. To clarify, no causal link has been established between administrative action and restrictions on First Amendment rights. The question is not whose fault is it, but rather is it okay to potentially lose an avenue to exercise our First Amendment rights?
Within the LIU network, expression of First Amendment rights is not limited to the newspaper or the ability to protest. The university was welcoming to Young Americans for Liberty, a student organization dedicated to promoting the principles of liberty, including free speech.
LIU Post YAL runs weekly open forums designed to encourage students to exercise their First Amendment rights within, and without, the discussion. The LIU Brooklyn YAL chapter is forming. The current generation is being socially instructed to censor and be politically correct; the student protests, the Pioneer, and YAL seek to instruct the opposite.
Any action (direct or indirect) taken against the aforementioned, the beacons of peaceful assembly, free speech and freedom of the press, in an attempt to limit their ability to serve their purpose, can be seen as potentially unconstitutional. Furthermore, it sets a dangerous precedent.

Final exams are soon over and the holidays will offer the opportunity to take a break from late evenings in the library and early morning classes. The common view is that the chance to rest is needed and leisure will make it possible for people to return highly motivated and full of energy.
But that hasn’t always been the case. The forty-hour workweek and two-day weekend is really a modern day invention, achieved by the labour unions during the first half of the 20th century. The working hours in the US has decreased during the 20th century and there are some reasons pointing towards a continuous decrease, according to data from Bureau of Labour Statistics.
Firstly, there is the predicted technological development suggesting digitalization and AI [artificial intelligence] will replace jobs containing repetitive elements.
Then there are left-oriented political views on limiting or decreasing work hours, e.g. seen in the Bernie Sanders campaign where he expressed that he wanted to bring back the 40-hour week. In some European countries like Finland, Sweden and France there are even cases where a six-hour workday and 35 hour workweek has been proposed and experimented with. The main argument is often that the shorter work period has no negative effect, rather a positive effect, on productivity.
On the other hand, there is globalization and increasing competitiveness, making it hard to believe any logics behind less work (where human labor is needed) and sustained economic wealth. And predicting less working hours is not something new.
Already in 1930, famous economist John Keynes predicted that today’s workforce would only work 15 hours per week and enjoy their free time instead. Today’s figures ranging from 30-40 is not near Keynes’ guess, suggesting that there is a will from people to choose increased pay over increased leisure.
What it comes down to, both on a societal and an individual level, is a situation where we want to get washed but not get wet. That is, most people would probably like to work a bit less, but we don’t want to compromise the economical situation. As a society we want technical advancement so that we could receive a high living standard with less working hours, but we don’t want high unemployment.
Maybe it is just the method of measuring work by the hour that is out of date? Perhaps more task-driven work schedules and pays should be implemented, making the job market more dynamic but also riskier? That’s something to think about while resting in front of the fireplace on Christmas Eve.

Today I received a beautiful gesture from a lovely lady that I helped carry some books for. It was totally unexpected, and completely gorgeous. It was a $10 Starbucks gift card.
Although many of you may think it’s not that significant, and you may think I am being sarcastic, I’m not. Many would see this as a tiny and insignificant gift, but for me it was as good, if not better, than getting a bought a car. Truly.
I wasn’t having the best of days, and I was trapped in a vault of emotion, where I had shut myself in and tossed the key. I was hiding out and didn’t think anyone would know where I was. But then, with a beautiful smile and a calming aura, that lady, Danielle, who works in the library, walked in and said, “Harry, I just want to say thank you for helping me with the books last week.” She handed me the gift. I was so caught off guard because I wasn’t even in this reality at that time. It was like an angel had opened that vault door and guided me out. After she gave it to me and walked away, I sat there and looked at the “thanks, this one’s on me” written on the gift card, and it brought a tear to my eye. This wasn’t because of my assured coffee addiction or that for the notion that I was getting a ‘free’ coffee. It was because it was so delicate, so innocent and unneeded, yet Danielle took the time out of her day to think of me and go to Starbucks just to get Me a gift.
I did not expect it in the slightest to be rewarded for doing a nice deed like carrying books upstairs; I don’t deserve such a lovely gesture for something so small.
This to me, and many religions would agree, was a God-like action; it was purely divine. Danielle didn’t know that I was having a bad day, how could she? And she didn’t know that something so small would make such an impact on me right then and there. But with such an unselfish and caring manner, she thought, “that was nice of him to help me and I want to thank him.” Utterly stunning.
A small gesture that in a beautiful reality is a tremendous one. Someone might need a gift, and not a materialistic gift, but something thoughtful and easy, which is totally unexpected, that doesn’t make the other person feel like they need to get something in return.
I really hope you don’t buy a gift for someone expecting something in return, because that’s you wanting to gain or capitalize, making your gesture completely invalid. Instead, just get a gift to say thank you. This truly gave me hope, at a time when it felt like I was on the brink of losing hope in many people, that we have humans in this world who don’t just think of themselves.
As Christmas is approaching and this glorified buying of material is ever so ‘present,’ I think we should all think of, firstly, who we want to buy a present for, and secondly, why we want to buy them a present.
I think we have lost this notion of buying someone a gift because we feel forced to, because that is the norm. But why? Why do so many of us just buy gifts don’t actually mean anything? Just giving for the sake of it.
When I was a young British boy still being carried up the stairs by my mummy after falling asleep watching television (which was only a couple years ago), my mum used to read me a book. And in that book it would say this after every page. “I will love you forever, I will like you for always, and for as long as you are living my baby you’ll be.”
I haven’t seen my mother for months, and I haven’t spoken to her too much since I have been away, but I know what I am going to get her as a gift for Christmas. I want to get a plaque that says that quote on it, but instead of baby, I’ll say “Mummy.” And I know that she would appreciate that over a pair of earrings or a necklace. Because that small quote has meaning behind it. It will give her some nostalgia of a time before she became an empty nester when my brothers and I left home. She will love it.
For me, this is what a present or gift represents. Ok, Danielle’s gift to me wasn’t a piece of nostalgic beauty, but it was an unselfish beauty for someone she barely knows, and that in its own right is perfect. So please, take a step back and ask yourself, are you unselfish? Would someone maybe benefit from a small, beautiful gesture? Really think about the gifts you may get for people during the holidays; it would be wrong if you didn’t, because then we are no longer thinking of individuals, but of robots who follow a system. After all, we can all be beautiful, can’t we?
Now Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone, writing for you was a pleasure this semester.

Over the past month president-elect Donald Trump has been slowly selecting who will serve in his presidential cabinet, and so far the choices have been nothing short of controversial. Trump has to fill hundreds of positions, however, the top spots are Chief of Staff, Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, Secretary of Defense, Chief Strategist and Attorney General; all except one have been filled.
Trump’s Chief of Staff will be Reince Priebus, who previously served as chair of the Republican National Committee. Priebus played a key role in getting Trump elected through his leadership in the Republican National Committee and clearly gained Trump’s trust in the process. As the Chief of staff, Priebus will be the president-elect’s top aide and advisor; he will play a large role in the west wing of the white house.
For National Security, advisor Trump selected retired Army Lieutenant General Mike Flynn. Flynn is a registered democrat but is perceived to have more in common with republicans when it comes to national security, given his more aggressive approach in the Middle East. Flynn has also come under sharp criticism for a statement he made in an August speech saying that Islamism is a “vicious cancer inside the body of 1.7 billion people” that has to be “excised,” according to CNN.
The most controversial of appointees to the president-elect’s cabinet thus far has been the selection of Steve Bannon for the position of Chief Strategist. Bannon has most recently served as executive chair for the conservative news agency Breitbart news. Bannon has described himself as a member of the ‘alt right.’
For the position of Attorney General, Trump has selected Jeff Sessions. Sessions has represented Alabama in the U.S senate since 1997 and before that was the Alabama state Attorney General for two years. Democratic politicians have criticized the choice of Sessions because of his failed nomination to the U.S District Court for the southern district of Alabama in 1986. Sessions was nominated for the position by Ronald Reagan and was opposed by the NAACP.
Trump chose retired Marine General James Mattis to serve as the Secretary of Defense under his administration. Mattis served in the U.S Marine corps from 1969 to 2013 and at the time of his retirement held the rank of four-star general. Mattis served in a leadership position for the Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan War and Iraq War of 2003.
As for Secretary of State, the position has yet to be filled. Mitt Romney, David Petraeus and Rudy Giuliani have been two individuals presumed to be in the front running for the position.

Sean Fitzpatrick, the co-director of the LIU Post Jazz Combo, and the piano accompanist for the Long Island Sound Vocal Jazz, will direct the LIU Post Jazz Ensemble on December 7 in the Hillwood Recital Hall. The show, which is free for LIU Post students with I.D. will last from 8:15-10:15 p.m.
Senior music education major Robert Riepe, the bass player for the Jazz Ensemble, has had a positive experience playing at Post. “The teachers here really pushed me to play and learn. I’ve played countless gigs with my classmates and professors for the Tilles Center, school events, and during our trip to the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland last summer,” he said. “Our school gives our music students fantastic opportunities. I have met famous musicians who I adore such as Esperanza Spalding and Jimmy Heath.”
Riepe said that playing in the band has helped shape his musical career. “I’ve grown in so many ways and capacities just over the few short years being at this university. All of my teachers have impacted my growth as a musician and as an individual.”
The Music Department will host three other end-of-semester shows including the LIU Post Wind Symphony and Wind Ensembles on December 8 at 8 p.m. in the Tilles Center, the LIU Post Chorus with the Cecilia Chorus and Orchestra of NY on December 10 at 8 p.m. at Carnegie Hall, and the LIU Post Merriweather Consort on December 11 at 3 p.m. in the Great Hall. For more information, call 516-299-2474.

Since arriving on the scene in June 2009, Jermaine Lamarr Cole, better known by his rap-name, J Cole, has consistently delivered hit-song after hit-song. Albums such as, “J Cole: The Sideline Story,” “Born Sinner,” and “Forrest Hills Drive,” the latter which on March 31 was received platinum honors. A remarkable feat, considering that Cole’s “Forrest Hills Drive” album was the first hip-hop album, with no features, to achieve platinum status since the year 1990.
Fast Forward to the latter days of 2016 and the music world is truly becoming a ‘Cole World’ once again. Since Nov. 2015, J Cole has alluded to the fact that he had started work on a new musical project. “4 Your Eyes Truly” seems to be J Cole’s next upcoming project, and if his new hit single “False Prophets” is a preview of things to come, Mr. Cole may soon have another Grammy coming his way.
Cole’s “False Prophets,” which has no features, starts by way of chorus: “Somebody should have told me it would be like this, be like this.” Soon after the 15-second chorus ends, J-Cole wastes no time voicing his opinion on the latest drama surrounding fellow artist Kanye West.
Although Cole does not mention Kanye West by name, Cole’s lyrics unforgivingly slash from head to toe West’s current state of relevancy. “Ego in charge, in every move he’s a star, but we can’t look away due to the ways that he caught our hearts,” says J Cole, who seems to be speaking from a typical fans perspective. “He’s falling apart, but we deny it,” Cole goes onto say, later implying that West’s latest album “Life of Pablo,” pails into comparison from West’s past albums.
After ridiculing West’s music, J Cole offers his insight as to what may be attributing to West’s downward spiral by seemingly calling out the Kardashian family, or “The women…The Yes-men, [nobody] ever seems to contest them.”
Cole spins 180 degrees, using the mastery of his lyrics to let his narrative come full circle. Cole goes onto say that he doesn’t care who listens to his music, claiming that his lowest moments in his life have come from trying to portray himself as someone he never was, a false prophet.
Before “False Prophets” comes to an end, Cole thanks his fans, stating, “Real God is in you, not the music you’re coppin’ [buying].” J Cole’s upcoming album “4 Your Eyes Truly” is slated to release on Dec. 9, and is currently available for pre-order on iTunes.

GIANTS
Currently sitting in a good position for a wildcard spot, the Giants, on paper, seems to be a team that could challenge any of the top teams in the NFC. It is the only team this season to beat the Dallas Cowboys, but that was a start for rookies Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot. They don’t have a signature win this season and taken games against the lowly Bears and Browns down to the wire.
I see the Giants as a playoff team, but that’s it. It could win a first round matchup, but I don’t see it beating Dallas or Seattle in the playoffs on the road. Those two teams are as complete as any in the league and the Giants are good, but not as good as either of those teams.
JETS
This season has been a disaster for the Jets. It opened the season against playoff teams from a season prior in five of its first six weeks and took a gut punch. The quarterback situation is a complete joke and Ryan Fitzpatrick manages to be under center every week even though he is unlikely to return as the starter next season. There are young guns waiting in the weeds. The Jets are already on to 2017 where it can’t get much worse. Can it?
KNICKS
Through the first quarter of the season, the Knicks have yet to identify itself as a contender or a pretender. The team has games where Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis look like all-stars and others where they struggle shooting from the field. They also have the tendency to disappear at times. They need to develop more consistency and use Carmelo’s strength of mid-range shooting and his ability to draw double-teams to open up the offense for the rest of the offense and the prolific Porzingis, who is having a stellar sophomore season.
YANKEES
Offseason time for the Yankees is always interesting because the team is seen as a “big spender” years prior, but the Bronx Bombers adopted a youth movement last season and if they want to embrace that, then they need to hold off, offering aging sluggers Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion multi-year deals. Youngsters Gary Sanchez, Greg Bird, Didi Gregorius and Luis Severino will have a lot on their plate this season. If everything falls the way the Yankees hope, the team’s core of baby bombers and influx of veterans can lead to a return to the postseason.
METS
Re-signing Yoenis Cespedes breathed a sigh of relief and brought back championship aspirations for the Mets. With him in the lineup, the Mets is simply a better team. His impact brings the level from a team with the best rotation in baseball and below average hitting, to a team that can contend with the Chicago Cubs for a pennant. I think the Mets will look to trade one of its outfielders and maybe get a catcher in return. Either way, it is a team favored to win the World Series.

Led by a second half charge that included a 13-point scoring advantage, the Pioneers forced overtime on Wednesday, Nov. 30, against the Wildcats from Daemen College, and sealed the deal in the extra session, winning 73-70 from the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y
Behind 58-44 with 10 minutes left, the Pioneers went on a 21-7 run to tie the score at 65 with 30 seconds left. Senior guard Jared Hall, who finished with 12 points and four assists, had the game-tying basket. During that stretch, three pointers brought the Pioneers back and were the catalyst; senior guard Jemal Mosley knocked down a pair, while senior forward Greg Dotston and junior guard Kyle McLeggan added three balls as well.
Both the Wildcats and Pioneers had opportunities to win in regulation; both failed to do so. In the overtime period, the Pioneers got four points from Mosley and a big two points from Dotson to solidify the comeback win.
Dotson had a game-and season-high 24 points on 67 percent shooting from the field, which included five three-pointers. He also grabbed 10 boards for a double-double. Mosley finished with 15 points, nine rebounds and three assists.
A big reason for its come-from-behind win was the second half performance. “We basically told our guys that we need to do a better job chasing and ball pressuring shooters this half and we need to get the ball inside against their zone. We were playing out of operating areas and not looking to get the ball inside,” Head Coach Erik Smiles said after the game. “In the second half we did a much better job moving the ball against their   3-2 zone and playing inside/out getting our forwards involved.”
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Dec. 3, against American International College and it came down to the final possession. After the Yellow Jackets missed two free-throws that would’ve sealed the game, McLeggan attempted a game-tying three but was off the mark. The Pioneers lost 85-82 and dropped to 2-6 on the season.
Hall scored 14 points, including three trey balls, grabbed five rebounds and totaled five assists. Freshman guard Jared Rivers led the Pioneers in scoring with 17 on 6-of-10 shooting from the field.
The matchup was very even and the only significant advantage the Yellow Jackets held was points off turnovers, which help contribute to the win. They scored 20 points compared to 10 for the Pioneers. The Pioneers totaled 18 turnovers, which was the second most they committed this season, and shot just 37 percent from the floor.
One of the Pioneers’ strengths this season was defense and in its first matchup, the team held the opposition to 35 percent shooting, a huge reason for this victory. In its matchup vs AIC, it allowed the opponent to shoot 44 percent from the field. As Smiles said before the season, “We tell our guys if you can’t guard then you can’t play here.”
Smiles and his team will look to improve their defense when they return to the court on Wednesday, Dec. 7, against St. Thomas Aquinas College. Game-time from the Pratt Recreation Center is set for 7:30 p.m.

With the score deadlocked at 51 with under eight minutes in the fourth quarter, the Pioneers went on a 13-0 run and closed the door on a Daemen College comeback attempt, winning 69- 59 on Wednesday, Nov. 30, at the Pratt Recreation Center.
The Pioneers was led offensively by sophomore guard, Shannon Doyle, who had a game-high 15 points on over 50 percent shooting from the field. Another key contributor, senior guard, Kylie Garrett, notched 14 points and five rebounds. During its 13-0 run, Garrett started and finished the stretch with lay-ups, the latter of which put the Pioneers up 64-51 with just under four minutes left.
Sophomore forward, Sasha Patterson, earned her first double-double of the young season, pouring in 11 points and grabbing 18 rebounds. Senior forward, Janaysia James, finished with 11 points and nine boards. As a team, the Pioneers dominated down low, outscoring the opposition 32-16, and with its 27-point scoring prowess off the bench.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Dec. 3, against American International College. In their matchup, Garrett poured in a game-high 19 points, but it was not enough as the Pioneers suffered a 61-55 loss. The team currently sits at 4-4 on the season.
The Pioneers faced a 10-point deficit in the third quarter, but rallied for a 15-3 run and grabbed a 44-42 lead with eight minutes left in the game. The go-ahead basket came courtesy of freshman forward, Mikaiya Moore. Besides Garrett, the Pioneers’ offense also got contributions from Kristen Olsen and Moore, who scored 12 and 11 points, respectively.
In the final minutes of the games, the offense was held with a made field goal from which the Yellow Jackets capitalized, taking the lead and winning by a six-point margin. For the game, the Pioneers shot just 28 percent from the field.
Head Coach Deirdre Moore and her team are back in action Wednesday, Dec. 7, against East Coast Conference opponent St. Thomas Aquinas College. Tip-off from the Pratt Recreation Center is scheduled for 5 p.m.
