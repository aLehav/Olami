LIU Post’s new football stadium was supposed to be completed by this fall. However, as it currently stands, construction has not even started yet. Work on the stadium is tentatively slated for the end of the fall sporting season.
“We are planning to actually start construction or demolition shortly after the fall sports season has ended, which will hopefully be at the end of November,” said William Kirker, director of LIU Post›s Facilities Department.
Two members of the Post football team stated that they believe plans for renovating the football stadium are already in progress. However, one of those students, Steven Laurino, a junior History Education major, is unsure of what the future will hold regarding those plans. The outcome would “depend on whether or not the athletics department can raise enough money,” Laurino added.
However, “There have been no renovations made to the stadium,” Laurino stated. “There are plans . . . most likely following this season,” Laurino also mentioned that the new renovations “would primarily be new bleachers . . . much taller than the bleachers currently standing, and it will have a large number of chaired seating, less bench style.”
“They are planning to renovate the stadium completely,” said
Rob Bright, a junior Business Management major, also a member of the football team. In more detail, Bright added that it would be a “much nicer and larger stadium, which would be connected to Pratt.”
Bryan Collins, coach of LIU Post’s football team and university athletic director, expressed why progress is taking so long. Collins stated that they “did not receive permits from the town of Brookville . . . until the summer months, and then we decided to create a two phase portion of building the stadium.”
“Phase one is going to start after the fall football season, and it’s going to be replacing the bleachers and the seating within the bleachers,” Colllins added.
Collins stated that the delay is due in part to complaints by residents in the Town of Brookville. Potentially distracting noise was a main issue, and the town was not satisfied with the plans to build the new stadium.
“The village had many concerns about noise and crowds. We assured them about what we were aiming to do with the rebuilding. We told them it would be less loud, and I believe when they heard that, they accepted to grant us the permits,” Collins continued.
LIU Post’ s old football stadium has been in use since 1965, according to Collins. “We want to make the new stadium a great experience, for our Pioneers, and our University.”

This past month, student loans were transferred to the Sallie Mae loan company. The Federal Government has made a few changes to their methods because of the large amount of loans students are applying for. Although students might feel as though they should have been alerted about the transfer of their loans beforehand, the change was beyond LIU Post’s control.
LIU Post, according to Joanne Graziano, associate provost for the Student Financial Services, didn’t have any control over the transferring of several student loan profiles to Sallie Mae, a well-known and often criticized loan company. “These kinds of decisions are made by the Department of Education; Post did not give the loans to the students.”
In an automated email sent to those whose loans were transferred about a week ago, the Direct Loan Servicing Center explained that the Federal Student Aid has “expanded the federal loan servicers to provide additional servicing capacity.”
Federal resources are kind of limited, according to Graziano. “So [the federal government is] hiring companies like Sallie Mae to assist them,” she added.
Payment plans will remain the same, except now students will have to send in their loan payments to the Sallie Mae Company. Sallie Mae will also assist students if they need to adjust their loan payments.
“When students signed the Master Promissory Note [when they applied for the loan,] they gave the federal government permission to do as they pleased with the loan,” Graziano added. She also compares signing the Master Promissory Note to signing for a mortgage. “You make a deal for the life of that mortgage.”
There are rumors of Sallie Mae harassing those who take out loans with them. “Like with any other loan company, if you agree to a payment plan, you have to be on time with your payments. Late payments result in those phones calls,” said Graziano .
This is not just happening at LIU Post, according to Graziano, it is happening at many other universities as well.
According to LIU Post senior and English Literature major, Nicole Ramlogan, this is not the first time loans were chosen and switched to other loan service providers. “Last year, my federal loans were transferred to Nelnet.” Ramlogan, who had two other friends who experienced this change, explained that she was not worried at all when she received a letter in the mail disclosing the details of the transfer. “Everything [about my loan arrangements] stayed the same.”
When asked if she would have preferred some sort of notice before her loan transfer, Ramlogan stated, “I’m indifferent. If you sign [a loan agreement], you should know what you’re signing for.”
Not every student at LIU Post had their loans transferred because the loan load was basically split between the Direct Loan Servicer and Sallie Mae. Though it is still unclear the criteria used to choose student loan profiles to be transferred, all students should check their My LIU emails to see if their loan was switched over to Sallie Mae.

Kings Hall is closed this semester to students because there are about 200 less students living on campus, according to Jennifer Fuoco, director of Residence Life. Statistics released by the Admissions Office on the university’s website show that enrollment has been dropping at LIU Post for the past couple of years.
“Due to a lack of demand for on-campus housing, Kings Hall is not occupied this semester. Kings Hall was not offered during Returning Student Room Selection and staff was never assigned to the building,” said Fuoco.
In the 2011–12 school year, there were 4,485 undergraduate students and 2,820 graduate students at LIU Post, as shown on the university’s website. During the 2012–13 school year, the enrollment dropped to 4,429 undergraduate students and 2,697 graduate students.
Rita Langdon, Public Relations director, said the 2013–14 enrollment numbers are not available at this time because the semester has just begun and students are still enrolling and registering for classes.
Jessica Falconer, a junior Forensic Science major, resided in Kings Hall last year and applied to move there again this year. “There weren’t enough people. Because enrollment is down so much there weren’t enough students to fill it. Now everyone will have a roommate and they won’t have to pay an RA [resident assistant],” said Falconer.
Falconer was notified that she had to change dorms after she submitted the application. The university switched her to Riggs Hall and she didn’t have a choice as to which hall she would move to. Falconer doesn’t mind the change and said that the two halls are very similar. She added that the bathrooms in Riggs might even be a little nicer.
Fuoco said that Kings Hall will be renovated while there are no students residing in the building.
“While Kings Hall is closed, the Facilities staff will take the opportunity to remove any remaining carpet from the rooms, install new flooring, and paint the bedrooms and common areas,” Fuoco added. “In 2009, Queens Hall was closed and underwent similar renovations. The building reopened the following year,” she added.
Amadi Weekes, a junior Biology major, who dorms in Nassau Hall noticed a change in campus life this semester since Kings Hall closed. “Everywhere I go [on campus], I don’t see anyone,” said Weekes, “Wherever I go I mostly see freshman…and that’s weird.”
Some students feel that less people are enrolling at LIU Post because of the price of tuition. When asked about the reason for the decrease in enrollment at LIU Post, Brian Harrigan, a senior Psychology major, joked by saying, “You mean besides being less expensive?”
His friend Melody Schaal, also a senior Psychology major, agreed, saying that more people are probably enrolling at state universities because of the high price at LIU Post.
Fuoco agreed that this is the reason that many students stopped dorming on campus. “The majority of students choosing not to reside on campus indicate that is due to financial difficulty.”

On Saturday, Sept. 14 the LIU Post football team defeated the Southern Connecticut State University Owls (0-2) by a final score of 24-12. Redshirt junior quarterback Steven Laurino starred in the home opener for the Pioneers (2-0) as he threw for over 200 yards and two touchdowns and also rushed for 92 yards. This marks the second consecutive season the Pioneers have started the season 2-0 and won their home opener.
Both teams came away empty on their first possession of the game. However, on the Pioneers’ second possession, they marched down the field 83 yards in less than two minutes to kick off the scoring. The touchdown was a 58-yard pass from Laurino to redshirt senior Joe Botti. The big-play receiver now has three touchdowns through the first two games of the season. The Owls finally found the endzone with just under 11 minutes left to play in the second quarter when sophomore fullback Michael Johnson punched it in from one yard out. The extra point that followed was unsuccessful so the Pioneers led 7-6.
About midway through the quarter, the Pioneers padded their lead when Laurino found redshirt freshman wide receiver Michael Richardson for a 16-yard touchdown. Later as time expired to conclude the half, senior kicker Karsten Viste nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Pioneers a comfortable 17-6 advantage. The third quarter was a defensive quarter. Both teams had a difficult time developing an offensive rhythm and putting together solid, lengthy drives that resulted in points. Eventually with 5:26 remaining in the quarter, the Owls cut into the lead from the Pioneers with a two- yard touchdown pass from senior quarterback Jacob Jablonski to junior wide receiver on attempt, but failed. The score heading into the fourth quarter was 17-12 with the Pioneers still holding onto the lead.
Jablonski was interception-free through the first quarters, but he made two critical mistakes when it mattered the most in the fourth quarter. Pioneers senior outside linebacker Tommy Williams capitalized on the ill-advised throws and as a result, intercepted two key throws. In addition, the Owls also threatened another time deep in LIU Post territory, but could not convert. It was fourth and goal on the two yard line, and Jablonski got sacked by senior linebacker Rob Bright and junior defensive lineman Bernardo Nunez for a loss of downs.
The defensive was clutch and made critical plays down the stretch of the game in crunchtime. The Pioneers’ defense put the offense in great field position for the last touchdown of the game when senior running back Jeff Mack scored from two yards out to finish off the Owls by a final score of 24-12.
The next game for the Pioneers is on the road on Friday, Sept. 20 at 7:00 p.m. against the Bentley University Falcons (1-1). The next time the Pioneers play at home at Hickox Field is on Saturday, Oct. 5 against Merrimack College (1-1).

AM, Arctic Monkey’s latest album became the bands fifth number one record in the UK. The band was formed in 2002, and by 2006, had grown an adoring internet fanbase following their debut full-length album, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not. To some, that album is one of the greatest in the garage-rock genre. Seven years later, the Arctic Monkeys has released its fifth studio effort, AM. The album was released on Sept. 6 through Domino Recording Company.
AM opens up with the bluesy track “Do I Wanna Know?” which prepares listeners for the album and is followed up with “R U Mine?” Both songs contain a very simple-riff that carries throughout the songs.
Alex Turner, the lyricist, singer, and guitarist, has a powerful crooning voice, and the reverb only makes it 100 times smoother. On top of the outstanding vocals, the lyrics are very passionate and haunting.
I may add that “I Wanna Be Yours,” originally written by British poet, John Cooper Clarke, and with Turner’s original chorus, is a dark tale of love. This is the first time an Arctic Monkeys’ song had not been primarily written by Turner.
Joshua Homme, singer, song-writer, and guitarist for Queens of the Stone Age, lent his musical talent to a few tracks on the album. “Knee Socks” and “One for the Road” make it quite clear how his friendship with Turner has affected the Monkeys. His vocals add an intensity to the album. With influences for the album ranging from The Black Keys and Black Sabbath to OutKast, and even comedians such as George Carlin and Louis CK, there’s always something new to look forward to on each track. Arctic Monkeys are there to impress, and this album is recommended for fans of any kind of music.
Key Tracks: “Fireside”, “Arabella”, “Number One Party Anthem”, and “Snap Out of It”
Rating: 10/10

A sea of eager faces swarmed through the front doors of residence halls at LIU Post on September 2nd and 3rd, marking the start of a new school year. Move-in day provided students the opportunity to prepare their new place of residence before fall classes began on September 4. Incoming and returning students alike were welcomed to the Post campus with various new changes and obstacles they may not have expected.
Move-in day occurs over a span of two days at Post. Incoming freshman move in on September 2 and returning students the following day, with the exception of athletes, who move in two weeks before the semester begins and international students who move in on August 29.
Beginning at 9 a.m. students were able to move their belongings into their dorm rooms. The process began with students signing emergency contact forms, housing agreements and an entrance inventory form that informs students of the furniture in their rooms and what has been recorded as damaged. Resident Assistants, Residence Hall Directors, and athletes all took part in helping students move into their dorms. Students were then shown to their rooms and were able to try out their door codes.
“Move-in day at Brookville seemed much quieter than it was the year before,” said Tina Lo, a senior Psychology major currently residing in Brookville Hall.
“There were not any obvious changes when I moved in, how- ever, no one showed me to my room as they usually do, and there was a box of Red Bull sitting on my desk, as a welcoming gift. I’m not sure who left it there but, I thought that was an interesting gesture,” Lo added. South Residence Hall, also known as ‘the suites,’ houses several students in suites, with one large common room and four bedrooms, with two students per room. Move-in day at this residence hall was much different compared to the years before and some students commented on the obvious change.
“Most of us that were placed in the suites are there temporarily,” said Gyujin Hwang, a junior Public Relations student. Some students living in South Residence Hall were placed there if they did not attend room selection.
“Not all of the dorms are open this semester. Kings Hall and the Suites are currently vacant,” said Carl Martinez, a resident assistant (RA) in Nassau Hall. “Renovations are taking place in Kings Hall,” Martinez added. Students living in temporary housing assignments will be able to move into new dorm rooms when the opportunity presents itself, but for now all room assignments are currently full. Hwang continued to discuss life in South Residence Hall, stat- ing: “We do not have an RA, but there is an RA from Riggs Hall who comes to the building to make sure things are going well.”
Students who moved into Post Hall were welcomed with a change in the way they would be able to access the internet in their dorms. “We were told that we are allowed to have routers in all dorms now,” said Lauren Apkarian, a senior Public Relations student. Apkarian continued to share her move-in experience, stating: “There aren’t any elevators in my hall, so it was very tiring moving everything up to the third floor.”
When moving into their rooms, students are required to bring specifivc items to help accommodate them while living on campus. An Ethernet cord, used to connect students to the Internet in their rooms, is one of the many items students are told to bring while living on campus. Students are also asked to bring surge protectors, televisions cables, and printers to assist them with daily needs while living on campus.
Move-in day is the start of a new year at LIU Post. Students are provided with the opportunity to make their dorms feel like home, meet their new roommates, or reunite with friends.

Hobbies are as unique and varied as those who practice them. Collecting marbles and playing sports are fairly common ones, but how about the uncommon? LIU Post students have interests that may border on the weird, strange, and rare. This week, I asked students if they had any strange hobbies, but came to realize that, to them, their hobbies are normal. The question arises; what then is a strange hobby?
“I don’t know if it counts as a hobby, but I need to get my nails done every 4-5 days.” said Jacqueline Marino, a junior in the Medical Imaging Program.
“I’m a landscaper and I like to collect lawnmowers, so some might think that’s really weird,” said Nicholas Sesto, a junior Pre- Pharmacy major.
After gatherng some information, I scoured the Internet for some really quirky hobbies. While my chances seemed improbable of finding a student with a strange extra- curricular activity, I kept my hopes up.
According to ODEE.com, a blog that features the oddities of today’s world, the number one weirdest hobby is playing dead. Chuck Lamb, a 55-year-old man from Ohio, takes videos and photos of himself playing “possum”. He aspired to be an actor, but found he was only good at pretending to be deceased. You can visit his personal website, deadbodyguy.com. Number two on the list was a man from South London, who makes it his hobby to appear in the background of news reports filming in public areas.
I found one hobby to be particularly unusual: extreme ironing. After I discovered the obsession on toptenz.net, I stumbled upon a picture of a person scaling a mountain while ironing their shirt on an ironing board, which was tied to the mountain.
As I’m sure there are many others with strange hobbies, habits, or traditions, please write in to liupostpioneer@gmail.com and tell us about odd habits you may possess or have encountered. The possibilities are endless, especially when ironing can be a hobby if you make it extreme.

Every September tents go up and the stars come out at Lincoln Center for the Mercedes-Benz Spring Fashion Week. Even though the days are getting shorter and our sleeves are getting longer, that doesn’t mean we can’t have a little preview of what’s to come when the warmth returns. It’s clear that next spring will be full of animal print, leather, sequins, and floral patterns.
Designers came together to show case their talent and add a little pastel hue to the autumn leaves outside. The always-spunky designer Betsy Johnson showed the world that she wouldn’t be stopped by the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection she filed in 2012. Instead, she brought her designs right back to the top. Johnson featured textiles such as powder pink floral patterns that gave her pieces the notorious girly feel she has always presented so well. Her show consisted of comfortable dresses and capri pants, perfect for wearing around campus.
Designer Michelle Smith demonstrated that sometimes what’s underneath your clothes can definitely make or break your outfit. The collection Milly by Michelle Smith featured mesh skirts and jackets paired with neon bras and panties for a pop of color.
Veteran designers Michael Kors, Diane Von Fursternberg, and Rachael Zoe expectedly turned heads. Kors paired floral bandeau tops with airy maxi skirts while also presenting professional attire for both men and women. The suits could be the perfect outfit for any college student going to an important job interview. The variation between the bandeaus and suits gave Kors’ line a little sex appeal while keeping his clean sophisticated look.
A few designers also dazzled attendees. Rebecca Minkoff surprised her audience with a performance from R&B/Soul singer Janelle Monae. Monae’s music helped to add an urban flair to Minkoff’s already edgy collection.
Another showstopper of the week had to be Oscar de La Renta’s stunning gowns. Many know La Renta for his ability make a dress come alive. This year, his show started off with simple pencil skirts, but ended with haute gowns—something unexpected.. His line featured a lime- green gown with a leaf pattern that made it seem like foliage was falling from the model’s waist to the bottom of her gown. He also included a red rose dress, blooming for spring.
This year’s fall Fashion Week was a teaser for all the fashionistas out there. Even though the clothing may not be affordable, it doesn’t mean it can’t provide inspiration.

LIU Post students often have a difficult decision to make. Where you choose to live can make or break your college experience. The choice often boils down to privacy, comfort and affordability. If you spend your money wisely, living off campus can cost almost half the price of living on campus, but it does not come without its own share of drawbacks.
On campus, you are assigned a room that is around the size of an inmate’s cell. The room has a ‘60s feel and most likely has not been cleaned since then. The walls, made of white-painted cinderblocks, invoke the feeling of being held captive.
For a room and a meal plan you will pay up to $12,534 per year, according to LIU Post’s website. Living off campus allows you to decorate your space however you’d like. You will have furnishing freedom at your disposal,  and you may eat like a king. Maybe like a prince, to make the option more cost efficient.
There is also the issue of sharing space while on campus – sacrifices are to be made when living with roommates. The time when you could turn the light on or off whenever you please is over. Getting sleep without listening to pistachio nuts being cracked open at 2 a.m. is suddenly too much to ask for. Listening to music or television through speakers instead of headphones will feel like a privilege.
“I don’t miss worrying about bathroom encounters and wondering if someone was going to pull the shower curtain,” said senior Psychology and Pre-Med major Kaaynat Afgun, who previously lived on campus.
Afgun also said she enjoys the freedom of living in Hicksville by the Broadway Mall and loves having easy access to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). “I live in walking distance from everything, and am not dependent on the shuttle,” she added.
Food choices on campus are limited to what they serve in Winnick and Hillwood Commons when the dining facilities are open, since purchasing a meal plan is mandatory. Constant meal choices include pizza, pasta, burgers, and wraps.
The salad bar would be a better option if it were maintained properly. Living off campus provides more dining options; you can cut fresh cucumbers, grill a steak, make pancakes, and boil eggs if you want to. At 3 a.m., you don’t even have to put on pants or walk outside in 10-degree weather to get to the kitchen.
“Living on campus, you have no privacy, and it is expensive, especially with all the rules and restrictions,” said junior Political Science major Herman Kummeneje, who moved off campus this year. “The greatest difference is having a kitchen and a bathroom. It is pure happiness,” Kummeneje added.
However, living on campus is convenient. Going to class takes a maximum of 15 minutes from anywhere at Post. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served at any time between 7:30 a.m. and 9 p.m., and you don’t have to wash the dishes or buy kitchen supplies. There aren’t worries about traffic, or buying toilet paper or hand soap for your apartment.
Deciding where to live really reduces down to whether you are willing to compromise privacy for convenience. You may enjoy waking up, going to bed, and everything in between on campus or you may want to save money while living comfortably, by your own rules, with a group of friends. The choice is yours.

Located in Roslyn Harbor is the Nassau County Museum of Art, or NCMA. Located about a mile from campus, off of Northern Boulevard (25 A), this museum offers a variety of sights to behold and incredible features. Recently, the museum presented a new exhibit titled Alex Katz: Selections from the Whitney Museum of American Art.
The museum first opened in 1989. Originally owned by William Cullen Bryant, a poet and preservationist, the property was purchased in 1919 by Henry Clay Frick, co-founder of U.S. Steel. The building was then designed by Sir Charles Carrick Allom. Years later, it became a private non-profit museum, subsequently purchased by Nassau County’s Office of Cultural Development. Funds for the museum came from a board of trustees, which included civic, social, and business leaders from Long Island. Today, the museum is funded through money received from parking, membership, admissions, special events, private and corporate donations, as well as state and federal grants.
“What particularly sets the museum apart from other fine arts museums,” according to Doris Meadows, Director of Media at the museum, “are the extraordinary Gold Coast grounds, 145 acres of beautiful gardens, rare specimen trees, walking trails, and sculptures.”
NCMA also presents different exhibitions, many of which are original and organized by the museum’s curators. Past exhibitions include European and American art movements, such as La Belle Epoque (June 2003), Picasso (Feb. 2005) , and Francisco Goya: Los Caprichos (Sept. 2011). Their current exhibition is Alex Katz, a landscape painter.The exhibition, Alex Katz: Selections from the Whitney Museum of American Art, opened on June 29 and runs through Oct. 13. It features vibrantly colored portraits of the artist’s friends and family. These portraits are a highlight of Katz’ career. This selection also includes paintings of early collages and landscapes.
Born in Brooklyn, Katz was raised in the St. Albans section of Queens. He developed an interest in art due to his parents’ passion for it. He studied at the Cooper Union School of Art, and there was trained in modern art theories and techniques. Years later, Katz grew to the same level as Fairfield Porter and Larry Rivers, other figurative painters. Eventually, he delved into realism and began painting portraits.
With a student ID, tickets are only $4. The Nassau County Museum of Art is right around the corner from LIU Post. For more information, visit www.nassaumuseum.org or call the museum directory at (516) 484- 9337.

The LIU Post soccer players had great expectations for their trip to Sweden during their preseason. The citizens of Malmoe encountered 25 American soccer players, biking around town. Men’s soccer Head Coach Andreas Lindberg had difficulties in believing it. “This feels unreal to me. I have fought for this to happen, ever since I got here. Being able to bring the boys to my hometown, it’s a dream come true!” The soccer team did not experience a typical American pre-season, running mile after mile, from early in the morning until late at night, making the jogging shoes instantly threadbare. Instead, their days were filled with regular soccer practices, games and different sorts of activities, everything well planned by Lindberg.
“The social part of this trip was of great importance to us. We know that we already are more fit and have more special individual players than most teams we face. Therefore, we wanted to focus on developing as a group,” said Lindberg.
The coaching staff had planned the trip which perfectly matched the annual Malmoe festival, making the city crowded with people, concerts and food stands. Sophomore midfielder Per Forgaard picked another favorite moment. “When we were visiting the amusement park “Tivoli” in Copenhagen, most of us had a great time. Clearly, some people were struggling with the roller coasters though,” Forgaard laughed.
Calling the week relaxing would be an overstatement. Most days were double practices, thus, the team managed to play three games in three days, walking out undefeated. Forgaard was positive. ”We met some great teams, and it was good for us to be able to set the standard for the upcoming season”.
Moving forward, how far will this team go this season? Well, it is obviously impossible to predict, although Lindberg explained why this could be the year for the Pioneers. “We have a great roster and players with special qualities this year, although we have to take one game at a time. At the end of the season, this trip could be the key.”
The team was able to bring parts of Sweden back to America.
Their competitive side and the willingness to win have given the Pioneers four straight victories so far this season, and they are continuing their journey towards playoffs.
