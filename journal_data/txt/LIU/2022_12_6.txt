LIU’s emerging rowing team is one of the newest teams to join the program and is already proving their capabilities with great success in competitions.
Junior Rowing Team member Dan Tellerman reflects on how much the team has changed between October 2021 to today. 
“We started last year with just nine people in total. If one person was late or missed practice, we couldn’t go out in the water that day, so it used to be rough, but we’re at about 25 people now, which is exciting,” he said.
On Oct. 16, the team saw impressive results during their efforts in the Overpeck Fall Classic, which ended with LIU collecting gold medals in the women’s collegiate novice 8+, women’s collegiate novice 4+ and men’s collegiate novice 4+.
A common thread amongst much of the team is that many of them had not previously had careers in rowing until coming to college. 
Sophomore Isabella Kolstad-Khan, who originally competed on Track but has since decided to join the Women’s Rowing team, appreciates the effort the staff and other team members make.
“When I first joined rowing, they were the most welcoming group. They take time to teach you everything you need,” she said.
Tellerman is also getting adjusted to the lifestyle and workout required for the sport of rowing.
“I did a lot of sports growing up but never did rowing. I had no experience with it at all. I used the machine once or twice at the gym, but that’s as far as I ever went before I joined the team,” Tellerman said. 
So far, the team has been involved in two regattas this season. A regatta describes the various events and races that comprise a rowing competition. 
“We’ve raced our first two races this year, we’ve all placed, and the men specifically took home a silver medal on our first race and then the gold medal on our second. It’s been great so far,” Tellerman said.
The team prides itself on working out 10 times a week, which includes lifts, rowing machines and other forms of practice. 
Players acknowledge the work Head Coach Jacyln Smith and assistant coaches Julien Blythe and Aaron Bosgang have invested to get the team prepared.
“The coach we have is super chill. She went to the Olympics. Knowing that we’re coached by an Olympian who’s done well is just a great feeling. She has so much great advice to give,” Kolstad-Khan said.
Not only is the team getting victories, but they’ve also created a sense of community among the group. 
Junior team member Leah Bowlby believes the team has great chemistry despite how brand new the program is. 
“We like to say that we’re one of the teams that get along the best. We’re a real family,” she said. “It was great to go out and see all of us supporting each other.”
LIU’s latest team seems to have a bright future ahead, with wins already under their belts and rising recruitment. 
Tellerman believes there is so much potential in the future of LIU Rowing.
“The biggest thing is getting more people on the team, and that’ll just come with time. Also, finding more recruits from high schools for next year,” he said. “Everything is going great. We’re getting stronger and faster every day.”

On Oct. 29, social media star Jake Paul was fighting against MMA fighter Anderson Silva. In just his sixth pro fight, Jake Paul did his best to make sure youth was served on Saturday night against MMA legend Anderson Silva.
Paul (6-0, 4 KOs), the 25-year-old social media influencer turned boxer, rallied for a knockdown in the final round to cement an eight-round unanimous decision in the main event of a Showtime PPV card from Desert Diamond Arena. Paul took home scores of 77-74 and 78-73 (twice) against the 47-year-old Silva, the former UFC middleweight champion.
Paul has long been criticized during his surprising turn to pugilism for not fighting a real boxer. He tried twice to close 2021 but scheduled fights against Tommy Fury and Hasim Rahman Jr. fell apart. A fight with Silva (3-2, 2 KOs in boxing), an opponent many Paul critics said would never fight, suddenly came together, fueled by Silva’s 2021 upset of former middleweight title holder Julio Caesar Chavez Jr.
“This fight surprised me,” sophomore sports management major Leissan Hibbert said after seeing the fight. “I mean I knew Silva was possibly at a disadvantage because he’s a kickboxer, but Jake Paul showed so many improvements.” 
Paul outlanded Silva, 83 to 79, according to CompuBox. He floored Silva in Round 8 with a counter right hand and landed 42 percent of his power shots overall, including a 30 to 13 edge to the body.
The performance was largely a mature one from Paul, who showed legitimate improvement from his last performance, a late knockout of former UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley in their rematch in late 2021.
Controlling much of the second half of the fight with three-punch combinations that began to the body and finished with right crosses upstairs, Paul continued to show what time and dedication can do.
Junior health science major Lameko Mayes watched the fight and was surprised about the outcome of the fight. 
“It’s a surreal moment for Jake Paul. Hard work pays off,” Hayes said. “Silva took so many hard shots throughout the whole fight. Dude was a dog. He was the toughest guy Jake Paul fought, but Paul just wanted it more.” 
Paul also has a lot of respect for Silva showing his respect to MMA Legend.
“I want to say thank you to Anderson. He was my idol growing up and he inspired me to be great,” Paul said. “Without him, we wouldn’t have a fight this year. He’s a tough mofo, like for real. I have a lot of respect for him.”
After the win, Paul turned his attention to calling out Nate Diaz, who is set to be a free agent following the expiration of his UFC deal, and boxing superstar Canelo Alvarez. The Diaz fight is much more realistic and seeds have already been planted as members of Paul and Diaz’s team engaged in a scuffle backstage shortly after Diaz’s teammate, Chris Avila, scored a victory to open the PPV card.
“Nate Diaz is a chump. He tried to fight me in my locker room and then left the arena,” Paul said. “So Nate Diaz, don’t be a chump. Come fight me. Anyone! Anytime! Any place!”

In Game 6 of the Fall Classic on Nov. 5, the Houston Astros beat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-1 to win the World Series. This is the second championship for the Astros in team history, the other occurring in 2017.
Game 1 of the World Series took place on Oct. 28. The Phillies were the sixth seed in the National League and earned a trip to the World Series following playoff victories against the Cardinals, Braves and Padres. On the other hand, the Astros were the top seed in the American League, cruising throughout the postseason, sweeping both the Mariners and Yankees. 
Despite all this, the first game was a battle. The game could not be decided in nine innings and went into extra innings. With the score tied in the top of the 10th, JT Realmuto homered, and the Phillies defeated the Astros 6-5.
In the second game, the Astros beat the Phillies 5-2 to tie the series at 1. In the first inning, the Astros scored three runs off of three doubles and an error by the Phillies. In the fifth inning, Alex Bregman’s 2-run homer increased the lead to 5-0. The Astros scored the next two runs but held on for the five-run victory.
Game 3 was supposed to be played on Oct. 31 but was canceled due to rain and played on Nov. 1. Because of this, the Phillies changed the pitcher who was scheduled to start Game 3, and handed the ball to Ranger Suarez, who pitched five scoreless innings. The result was a 7-0 win for the Phillies.
In Game 4, history was made. The Astros starter that day was Cristian Javier, who pitched six innings and held the Phillies lineup hitless. All three relief pitchers who came out after him also held the Phillies to no hits, completing the combined no-hitter, making it only the second no-hitter in World Series history. The Astros won the game 5-0.
In Game 5, after the no-hitter, both sides scored runs in the first inning. The Astros scored a run in the first inning, with Jose Altuve leading off the game with a double, followed by an RBI single by Jeremy Pena. The Phillies quickly tied the game when Kyle Schwarber, the leadoff batter, hit a home run. Pena had a leadoff homer of his own in the 4th, giving the Astros the lead back at 2-1. The game then proceeded to a low-scoring affair, and in the end, the Astros took the game by a single run, 3-2.
Game 6 would finally settle the series. The Astros were down 1-0 in the 6th but scored four runs in a row, including a home run by Yordan Álvarez. Then, they went on to win the game, and the Astros became world champions for the second time in five years. Astros shortstop Jeremy Peña was named World Series MVP.
Junior California State University business management major Takuto Kataoka commented on the results.
“The Astros cheated in the past. They were able to prove to the world what they were capable of by winning this World Series without cheating this time. I want them to be proud of this victory,” he said.
Junior Middle Tennessee State University communication major Kota Sato believes the Phillies put up a good fight despite the odds against them.
“I wanted the Phillies to win this World Series because they have not been the World Champions for a long time. However, they entertained us so much, so I want to thank both teams,” he said.

On Nov. 1, Takeoff, who is a member of the hip-hop group Migos, was shot and killed in Houston, Texas. This news shocked many people, including his fans.
Migos is a music group formed in 2008 by family members Takeoff, Quavo, and Offset. Quavo is Takeoff’s uncle, and Offset is their cousin. They were popular not only for their music but also for their fashion. What made them popular was a music album released in 2017 called “Culture.”  “Culture” quickly became a hit and reached number one on the U.S. charts. After that, the group continued to produce a lot of music together. In addition, the style of rap music they popularized had a major influence on today’s hip-hop music scene. They have even performed with big-name artists including Drake and Katy Perry.
In a sad turn of events, on November 1, Takeoff went bowling downtown with Quavo, and there was a party going on at the bowling alley. Then, an argument broke out and a shooting ensued at 2 a.m., while they were playing a game. Takeoff sustained a gunshot wound to the head area and was certified dead on the spot. According to the report, there were about 40 to 50 people at the scene, and two people besides Takeoff were shot, but their condition has not been disclosed to the public. The cause of the altercation which started the shooting is still unknown. The day before the incident happened, Migos had just released new music.
This news saddened fans all over the world.
Senior business management major at University of Hawaii at Hilo Erick Shinjo was shocked to hear the news. 
“His music had all kinds of messages in it, and those songs have encouraged me many times. I also loved their stylish fashion. So, when I heard this news, I was very shocked and could not believe it,” Shinjo said “He was a very great rapper and was going to be a great addition to rap music in the future.” 
Junior business management major at California State University San Bernardino Takuto Kataoka commented.
“The members of Migos were not a group formed from friends, but were strongly connected by their relationship as cousins and uncles. Then, their charisma attracted people from all over the United States and the world,” Kataoka said. “It was very shocking news to me that he passed away in such a situation. I am very sad to think that I will not be able to hear any more songs by the three of them.” 
Junior business management major at Fresno Pacific University Koutarou Matsumaru made this comment about the incident.
“Takeoff was a hero for me. His songs had the ability to influence people’s feelings. It is hard not to hear those songs anymore,” Matsumaru said. “I know he was popular with other artists as he has performed with many big name artists in the past. His personality was wonderful. I am so shocked because he was such a great person.”
 The perpetrators of this incident have not yet been identified, and the details of the case are not entirely clear yet. The police are trying to unravel this case that has shocked so many people.

Selena Gomez debuted her documentary, “My Mind & Me” on Friday, Nov. 4. She gave viewers a close look into her life the past six years. She discussed her struggles with lupus, mental illness, and stardom.
Gomez first explained how much she loved to sing and act. She got her first job at 7-years-old on Barney. She went on about how awesome it was to get away from reality, but slowly it started to feel awful. With all of Gomez’s success, she felt lonely. Her depression and anxiety worsened as she saw her name in the tabloids. She understood that no matter how successful she was, she would always struggle with self-doubts and self-deprecation. 
Fans quickly understood how after 55 performances, the Revival Tour was canceled. Her physical illness became a complete emotional breakdown, leading to an episode of psychosis in 2018. Gomez sought help to understand her ongoing spells of anxiety and depression. In 2019, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Fans of Gomez shared their thoughts on the vulnerability shown by Gomez in the documentary and how that shifted their perspective on celebrity culture.
“This documentary honestly reminded me that celebrities aren’t always happy. Yes they are lucky enough to have a fabulous life, but we only see what they want us to see. We tend to forget they struggle with their own personal issues,” sophomore psychology major Olivia Nawara said.  
The film showed how connected Gomez is to helping those in need. She took a trip to Kenya where she visited a school that she helped fund. While being there, she met a college student who related to her struggles with pressure and self-harm. Gomez wants to build genuine connections with the people she meets to help them through their problems. She explained in a recent interview that her dream one day is to focus on philanthropic work.
Throughout the documentary, Gomez speaks about how she does not want her Disney past to define her or her past relationships either. Growing up, Gomez was always overshadowed by her previous work and fans still know her as the character Alex Russo from “Wizards of Waverly Place.” She also expressed concern with fans still viewing her as an extension of her famous ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber.
“When am I just gonna be good enough by myself?” Gomez said. 
 Every show before Gomez goes on stage, she would have to check her blood pressure because if it was too high she could have a stroke due to her lupus. Gomez has been struggling with lupus since 2015. As the disease progressed, her kidney was failing and needed a transplant immediately. Francia Raisa, a close friend of Gomez for 10 years, donated her kidney to Gomez in 2017. 
Gomez went into great detail with her health struggles in the film, but did not mention her kidney transplant or Raisa. This raised many eyebrows as to why she did not mention her. Further, in a recent interview in Rolling Stone, Gomez named Taylor Swift as her only celebrity friend in the industry. Following this interview, Raisa unfollowed Gomez and commented “Interesting” under the E! News post of her quote. 
Fans were in shock of the drama that was going on and it spiraled on TikTok. One fan made a video breaking down the drama and Gomez commented “Sorry I didn’t mention every person I know.” 
Fans of Gomez on campus shared their feelings on this controversy.
“I was a bit shocked that Selena didn’t go into detail about the person who donated their kidney for her. If that were me, I would honor them in every way possible,” sophomore criminal justice major Sabrina Kuvykin said. “Francia is not just a person, she’s someone who saved her life,” she added.
Viewers tune in to know more about Gomez and the hardships she dealt with. By offering the insights and struggles that Gomez went through, viewers might understand their own struggles. In the film, she spoke to many young people about the struggles they went through and how they almost took their life until Gomez helped by sharing her own experience. 
“I love Selena Gomez. I watched her in “Wizards of Waverly Place” and have loved her ever since. She’s one of the very few celebrities that is down to earth and doesn’t revolve herself around drama like many other celebrities do. I believe she genuinely cares about her fans and their mental illness,” freshman veterinary technology major Lilian Ferguson said.  
On her release date she gave her fans a link to redeem a code that is valid until Dec. 2 that gives people two free months of Apple TV+, giving fans the opportunity to watch her film for free.

Black Panther “Wakanda Forever” was released on Nov. 11. This film is in the sequel to   the first Black Panther film released in 2018. It has been very popular since its release and is currently showing as a blockbuster hit.
The first Black Panther movie was tremendously popular and set all kinds of records. The film received a lot of attention, including several awards at the Academy Awards. The film’s social themes and unique setting have made it popular with people of all generations. For example, the film has some links to real social themes, such as discrimination and a villain whose background is poverty. Further, Chadwick Boseman, who played the main character Black Panther in the film, was very popular and had a great impact on the world.
However, in 2020, Chadwick Boseman died of colon cancer. With the actor who played the main character gone, there were all kinds of concerns, including whether the second film of this franchise would ever be released, but now Wakanda Forever is here.
Junior Communications major at Gardner-Webb University Kazuya Kojima elaborated on the importance of Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the role Boseman’s death plays in that.
“Every single Marvel film is very important. So, this Black Panther is also an important film that will lead to future Avengers films, so I don’t want to miss it. Also, this film is linked to the death of actor Chadwick and the death of the king in the film,” Kojima said.
In “Wakanda Forever,” the role of Shuri, the younger sister, is the main character in the film to carry on the legacy of Boseman. In this film, the story takes place after the death of Black Panther. The story is about the Kingdom of Wakanda confronting its enemies in the absence of its king. The trailer for the film included some very exciting action scenes, including a battle at sea.
Junior business management major Cal state university San Bernardino Takuto Kataoka made this comment amidst all the expectations for the film.
“There were concerns about this film, such as whether it would be released to the public after the death of Chadwick, who played the main character in the film. However, we are very much looking forward to seeing how the story will progress now that it will be released to the public,” Kataoka said.
Senior Communication major at Western Oregon University Hibiki Ouchi also shared excitement surrounding the film’s release. 
“This is the second Black Panther movie. The first one was so much fun that my expectations for the second one are inevitably high. I am looking forward to seeing if it will exceed those expectations,” Ouchi said.
Many people have been anticipating a second Black Panther film. The film made $180 Million at the box office in its first month. . It could become  one of the most important Marvel films in the future. Therefore, many people do not want to miss this film. In addition, some people are sure to see this production in memory of Boseman

Latin music artist Bad Bunny is one of the most dominant names in the industry at the moment. His latest project Un Verano Sin Ti not only brought his career to new heights, but has brought reggaeton music to the mainstream. 
His rise to stardom was quick but also expected considering the amount of talent he has. Bad Bunny, born as Benito Antonia Matinez Ocascio, was born and raised in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. He was a member of the lower middle class, where his father was a truck driver, and his mother an English teacher. He grew up listening to Latin music, and as he got older, he started creating his own songs. 
“Bad Bunny is one of the best artists around. Considering that he has only been around for a short period of time, it is mindblowing to see the amount of success he has had thus far,” junior education major Erin Carlin said. 
Bad Bunny’s debut album titled X 100pre was released on Dec. 24, 2018. It was met with some commercial success, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard 200 chart. Since then, he has released three more studio albums, each gaining more popularity and sales. 
He was most known for his features on songs such as “I Like It” by Cardi B, and “Un Dia” by J Balvin and Dua Lipa. However, this changed when Bad Bunny released his fourth studio album in 2022. 
Bad Bunny’s most recent studio album titled Un Verano Sin Ti was released on May 6, 2022 and it completely blew away the expectations of fans and critics alike. 
Un Verano Sin Ti soared to the top of the Billboard 200 chart and stayed atop the chart for an outstanding 13 weeks. The album is a celebration of his Puerto Rican heritage, but is not afraid to discuss political topics. 
Fans of Bad Bunny praised him for the innovation shown on the album.
“This album changed the reggaeton scene. It not only is some of Bad Bunny’s best work, but it pushed the boundaries of what we normally hear in the genre,” Carlin said. 
The album is 23 tracks long and clocks in at 1 hour 21 minutes long, split into a Side A and Side B. Prior to the album’s release, Bad Bunny posted on his Instagram, “people, we have to worry less and enjoy more because life goes too fast.” Essentially, Bad Bunny wanted his fans to enjoy the music and treat it as a celebration of life more than anything.
“The best part about Bad Bunny is that his songs are so much more than what is being displayed on the surface. Sure, the song sounds like a fun summer banger, but if you take the time to read his lyrics, he discusses serious topics that some artists are afraid to discuss in their songs,” junior fashion merchandising major Grace Catanese said. 
“I think it is so impressive that an artist like Bad Bunny was able to skyrocket his career to a place of superstardom in such a short amount of time. Some artists can only dream of having his successes, especially so early on in their careers,” junior education major Katelyn Roseman said. Un Verano Sin Ti proves that Bad Bunny can create an album that tells a complete story from start to end. He is an artist that cares about the work he puts out, and if he continues on this trajectory, he is an artist that can continue to make music that tops charts.

Post’s latest play will be premiering on Dec 2 at the PTC Lab Theatre. Unlike most shows that have graced PTC, this production was written by one of Post’s own students, senior musical theatre major Rebecca Lynn Goldfarb. 
“Student directed productions and plays written by students being put on have happened before. However, this is the first play I know of— (or at least the first in a very long time—) where a student has written a play that Post Theatre Company is producing where the playwright is acting in it too, which is a really exciting feeling,” Goldfarb said. “This opportunity allows me to combine two of my favorite passions, writing and performing, and to be able to do this with fellow students who work hard and care as much as I do is really special. It really shows how talented my peers are and I’m so grateful to be able to work with them in this way.”  
Lynn Goldfarb has written and will be performing in the upcoming play, which was conceived as a senior honor thesis project titled “5 Jews and Near Death Experience (that shockingly has nothing to do with Antisemitism!) ”.
 The story details a modern American Jewish family who experience an extraordinary event and grapple with shared trauma. However, the themes are universal. 
Familial bonds are a core element of the production and the crew hopes the audience absorbs this message.
 “The experience is actually very medicinal. So many of us are so far from home and to get to talk, laugh, and reflect on family pulls on my heart more than I thought it would. I’m most excited for people to get to join in on that energy,” senior Director Tea Einarsen said. “I know when I see plays about the dynamics of relationships of siblings and parents I, of course, always think of my own.  I hope getting to hear the inner monologues of each of our characters makes people think about how they empathize with their own close relationships.”
The tone has been described as a comedic drama filled with touching moments. The backdrop of the plot is set just before a family’s youngest child’s Bat Mitzvah, a traditional Jewish coming of age celebration.
 “I couldn’t write a story based on a real event from my life and erase the truth of who I am as a Jewish person and artist. Hence, including a Bat Mitzvah in the plot came to be,.” Lynn Goldfarb said.
Jewish identity is intended to be a defining characteristic of the production’s theme. 
“Writing and sharing Jewish stories is really important to me. There is so much people don’t understand about our culture because they’ve never learned about it or have seen inaccurate representation in the media,” Lynn Goldfarb said. “Being able to share a very real and authentic Jewish family dynamic from today’s society is something I think all people should see.” 
Einarsen enjoyed the positive atmosphere that was maintained on set during pre-production.
 “The dynamic between playwright and a director can be fragile, but Becca and I found a solid rhythm very quickly,” Einarsen said. “I think because we had such a deep respect for one another, the production and piece really grew into something special.”
The narrative will be presented in a manner of inner dialogue which highlights the various characters’ thoughts.
 “I hope getting to hear the inner monologues of each of our characters makes people think about how they empathize with their own close relationships. I’m excited to, hopefully, bring a little more understanding to the relationships we might’ve left behind,.”Einarsen said.
The crew has encouraged anyone interested in the play to see it while it’s running.
 “I would love for anyone who’s interested in seeing the play to come.! This show is at its core about family, loss, and love — values and emotions that all people can relate to. I encourage anyone who sits in our audience to take our story in and try to imagine themselves as one of our characters,” Lynn Goldfarb said. 
The show will run through Dec 2 to Dec 4. On Dec. 2 it will be performed at 7:30 p.m., while the Dec. 3 and Dec. 4 shows will have shows at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.. “5 Jews and Near Death Experience(That Shockingly Has Nothing to Do With Antisemitism!)” will be the last PTC production of the fall 2022 semester.

When enrollment for spring 2023 opened to all students on Oct. 24, many students at Post struggled with creating their schedule due to a lack of availability in the courses they need in order to graduate on time. 
“Every semester I have a problem with finding courses,” junior marketing major Jess Morse said. “I get very stressed out when we have to enroll because I know there will be an issue … I have noticed a decrease in availability in many of my courses. I had a plan on what courses I would take each semester, and I can’t follow it because a lot of them are not offered. I am a marketing major, so many of the classes that are required for my major, like the marketing and business classes, are not offered, which is concerning.”
Morse has contacted her department head, as well as her Promise coach, for guidance when classes that are a part of her degree requirements are not being offered.
“In the past, if a class wasn’t offered before I would just hope that it would be offered the next semester and take it then. I am a junior now, so I can’t really do that anymore,” she said. “I am running out of time and it is getting more difficult each semester to find classes.”
Junior veterinary technology major Alan Krivenko has a difficult time making his schedule due to a lot of his class times conflicting with his required externship.  
“With the vet classes, some require externships during the junior and senior year two days a week,” Krivenko said. “My externship is on Wednesdays and Fridays, but when I was making my schedule, there were chem classes that conflicted with the externship.”
Krivenko knows multiple students that have had to take two classes that overlapped by more than 50 minutes. The student would leave one class early and arrive at the other class late every week. 
Junior fine arts major Liz Buckley thinks that there are limited options for professors teaching the courses that she wants to take, and this can harm her learning experience for specific topics.
“A lot of the fine arts and art majors are getting [their programs] cut, so it makes the variety of professors dwindle. I have the same professors for different classes now, because [the professors] are teaching classes that are not specific to their training and expertise. I feel like when I am in some of those classes, I don’t learn exactly what I’m supposed to because they don’t normally teach it.”
On the official LIU portal that students enroll in classes on, many courses are missing crucial information for scheduling. 
“Some of [the courses listed] don’t have the time the class is being held, or who the teacher will be until a few weeks before the class starts,” Buckley said. “That doesn’t work for everyone’s schedule. You’re basically gambling to get credits and if that doesn’t work, you are in a panic to figure something else out.”
Students are often unsettled while they create their schedules because they worry about being able to graduate on time. 
“[Making my schedule] has induced a lot of stress and anxiety and I hate feeling that way,” Buckley said. “It is only during enrollment where I get scared and anxious about my courses. I don’t think it should be like that, I think there should be people that are equipped to help you and to make that part of college easier. Students shouldn’t be stressed about if the university will offer them the necessary courses to graduate.”
When a student needs to take a course that is not being offered by the university, they can often request to create an independent study class for the semester.
Buckley reports having to contact multiple people, including her success coach, department chairs and professors in order to create an independent study course. 
“Classes I need to take aren’t [available] and independent studies are a pain because I don’t know which professors taught that class when it was running and I don’t know if they will want to come back and just teach one person … I am trying to get into an independent study now. I am trying to get into advanced painting, which I have to take [to graduate]. It was held and stopped being held in 2018.”
The Promise department provided the following response to questions regarding student concerns with creating their schedules:
“The Promise office seeks to assist students in making appropriate academic progress. Our coaches provide students with a plan of study. We can assist students in seeking available courses and, if they indicate a schedule conflict, our coaches can assist them. We can recommend finding an alternative class or facilitate communication with academic departments to inquire about appropriate options. Our goal for registration is to ensure students find courses that meet their degree requirements.”
As students are directly affected by the course options that Post makes available each semester, many have suggestions for the direction that the university could take to improve enrollment.
“I think the university can offer more options for classes and offer more teachers to teach those classes because having just one time frame and one teacher is impossible,” Buckley said. “When I thought I had my schedule semi figured out, the teacher switched and now my class time changed and no longer works with my schedule.”
Krivenko recommended that the university offer more time slots for classes that fill quickly. He says that the veterinary technology program students often compete to get into biology and chemistry classes with other programs, for example, the nursing program. 
“I think there should be more options for classes, rather than just one or two options for some classes,” Krivenko said. “It comes down to manpower, there are not enough professors to teach some of the classes that students want to take.”
While students may need to take the initiative in knowing what courses they need to take and when to take them, adjustments for course options and the times they are available are necessary to help improve the experience students have at Post. Students will not be as stressed if they know the courses they need to take will be made available to them without having to contact multiple faculty members regarding independent studies, substitutions and other alternatives each semester.

The term anti-semitism has been making multiple waves of notoriety in the headlines recently. Many celebrities, athletes and politicians have publicly shared their views. 
Some have wondered what brought this rise to a popular level. Rapper Kanye West has been seen as the unanimous frontrunner to this wave of antisemitism. Using tweets such as, “I’m a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I’m going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE,” as well as expressing his views in various interview appearances. These views received praise and criticism from social media users. 
NBA player Kyrie Irving also is seen as an influence to this wave of antisemetic ideals. The superstar point guard for the Brooklyn Nets was suspended for 8 games and lost his Nike brand deal for screenshotting a link to the movie “Hebrew to Negroes: Wake Up Black America.” Some players, like Jaylen Brown, came to Irving’s defense saying that the punishments were too harsh. Irving even had the support of the Israel United in Christ (IUIC), a Black Israelite group. IUIC members were seen standing in front of the Barclays Center in support of Irving’s first game back.
There’s two major factors involved. The first factor has been seen in more of a racial light. The rise of antisemitism has a very deep racial context to it. 
“The biggest problem is that their starting to mix up antisemitism with other oppressions. That shouldn’t be happening,” freshman social work major Leo Weiss said. 
The role of free speech has played a factor as well. The CEO of Twitter, Elon Musk’s, recent ownership of Twitter has led to people with antisemitic views to be provided an opportunity to spread these ideas on social media with little repercussion. 
“It makes people feel comfortable sharing their antisemitic thoughts if its so accepted in the media,” sophomore communications major, and Jewish Leadership Association (JLA) secretary, Jenna Melman said.
That hatred doesn’t stay online and leads to hate being spread in real life, putting the lives of Jewish people at risk. Two men were charged after making threats to attack a New York City synagogue on Nov. 20. The AMCHA annual report revealed there were 254 attacks on Jewish college students on 63 different campuses that had a high Jewish population.
“It’s scary, because there’s certain places where you can’t even go wearing a Jewish necklace without the possibility of danger. No one should be forced to hide their identity,” sophomore speech language pathology major Sharon Kariyev said.
Some students feel there’s a lack of respect shown at Post towards the Jewish community.
“We are really struggling with professors accommodating us on our holidays. Every other week we hear professors give outrageous statements about the jewish community,” Weiss added.
Many wonder how this issue can be fixed. JLA member and junior marketing major Daniel Tellerman has a few ideas.
”It’s about education.and just having a presence. A big part of what we’re doing as the JLA is embracing jewish life on campus. But also, we’re trying to put the message out there that the words and animity can’t be as powerful as they believe it can be,” Tellerman said.
The JLA’s president spoke in regards to having a strong base on campus.
“We are building a community on campus. There is more awareness and a sense of `we will represent you’ and now we’re building in numbers,” JLA president and junior art therapy major Renee Haimov said.
Anti-semitism is a problem that causes damage and hurts many. This new wave of these ideals hasn’t shown any different from the chaos caused in the past. With groups combating it like the JLA, the wave has all the possibilities of crashing out sooner than later.

This year, the off-campus shuttle, the Shark Shuttle, introduced new drivers and an updated schedule. As the semester comes to a close, students reflect on their Shark Shuttle experiences. 
The Shark Shuttle serves as the main means of transportation for dormers on campus, bringing students to Broadway Mall, the Hicksville train station and back to campus on a loop. 
Junior graphic art and design major Alan Knoll relies on the Shark Shuttle at least once a week to go to Broadway Mall. Here, he picks up groceries and hangs out at the Round One arcade.  
Knoll believes the shuttle is easy to use and a cost effective means of transport. However, he believes there’s room for improvement. 
Knoll has had issues with the shuttle arriving extremely late. On one occasion the shuttle drove past him completely. 
“I was standing right there and it drove past me. I guess they didn’t see me. I have a flashlight on now whenever it’s dark just in case,” Knoll said.
Knoll believes shuttle issues are much more prominent this semester.
“We had the same driver for two years and now there’s new people who I don’t think know the route. The first day the bus was in session they drove the complete wrong way,” Knoll said.
Going forward Knoll hopes for more training for the drivers and better communication so students aren’t left wondering about the shuttle’s wearabouts. This semester Knoll had to order multiple Uber rides due to the Shark Shuttle’s inconsistency. 
“I had to do it at least three times now. I had no problems with it prior to them switching who drives the bus,” Knoll said. 
These complaints are shared by sophomore marketing and merchandising major Amir Saunders. The Shark Shuttle is not his ideal mode of transport, but without a driver’s license Saunders has limited travel options.
“Since I’m out of state and I don’t drive, I often have to take the shuttle to get necessities from stores like Target,” Saunders said. 
Saunders has had multiple unfavorable experiences with the Shark Shuttle. With the new drivers and the updated shuttle schedule this semester, the shuttle service had a rocky start. 
“There were a few times at the beginning of this semester where they would literally drive behind the mall and nobody knew where to wait,” Saunders said.
Saunders voices his frustrations with the Shark Shuttle’s inconsistent pick up times. 
“The schedule has been all over the place. It’s often late to pick students up from campus so that can be super inconvenient when I’m on a schedule. It’s supposed to wait at [Broadway Mall] until the 50th minute of every hour, but it never does. It just shows up at like the 45th minute then leaves 10 seconds later. It doesn’t wait at all,” Saunders said.
As of now there’s no way for students to know where the shuttle is located as they wait to be picked up. Students like Saunders are left wondering if the bus left early or if it’s running late. 
The Shark Shuttle schedule states that LIU is not responsible for any delays or disruptions in service.
“You have to stand in whatever weather for like 10-15 minutes because it’s so unpredictable. that’s the only way you can catch it,” Saunders said.
Saunders claims to have gotten sick multiple times as a result of waiting a prolonged period of time in unfavorable weather.
Despite its quirks, The Shark Shuttle is still appreciated by students. Sophomore musical theater major Ruby Hough runs an instagram account dedicated to The Shark Shuttle, @sharkshuttleofficial. 
“I just think the overall premise of The Shark Shuttle is really funny. When I first got to school as someone without a car it was kind of a novelty. Me and my friends just started making jokes about it and I felt like the shark shuttle should have some sort of social media presence to bring together the lovers of The Shark Shuttle,” Hough said.
Despite the joking nature of the account, Hough appreciates the shuttle drivers. In her experience the drivers are very kind and timely. 
“The drivers are always very timely and wait an adequate time before leaving so as not to leave anyone behind,” Hough said.
Her main complaint is the lack of warning from the university when the shuttle isn’t running. She’s also taken notice of the inconsistency with the physical vehicle itself. 
“There seem to be a lot more different vehicles known as The Shark Shuttle, such as the long sort of vip looking one, the one with the shark emblem, the mini one and the extra mini mini van one that only has 7 seats. Last year there were really only one or two,” Hough said.

On Tuesday, Nov. 8, voters went to the polls, dropped off mail-in ballots or waited patiently for their already mailed ballots to be counted.
Gubernatorial races were held in 36 states, including New York. 34 states held elections for the U.S. Senate, which New York had as well. All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives were also up for election.
In New York, incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul (D) was elected to her first full term as Governor of New York. Hochul was serving out the rest of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) four-year term, which he was elected to in 2018. She rose to the position of governor after Cuomo resigned amid multiple scandals, becoming the first female governor of the Empire State. Hochul faced a stiff challenge from Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican representing New York’s first congressional district on eastern Long Island.
Hochul defeated Zeldin by 5.7 points, receiving 52.4 percent of the vote while Zeldin received 46.7 percent. This election was closely watched by pundits in the final weeks due to the close margin in the polls in the traditionally deep blue state. 
Democrats have easily won state-wide elections in New York for the past 15 years by double digits, however this year the state saw a right-ward shift, more so than the rest of the nation. For reference, Cuomo won the 2018 Gubernatorial election by 23.4 points, a much wider margin than Hochul’s 5.7 points.
Much of the rightward shift was seen in the New York City suburbs, as Zeldin flipped Nassau, Suffolk and Rockland Counties from blue to red, compared with 2018. Hochul flipped Columbia and Schenectady Counties from red to blue, however these are much less populated than the three counties Zeldin flipped.
In addition to flipping both of Long Island’s counties in the Governor’s race, the newly-drawn third and fourth congressional districts, both located almost entirely in Nassau County, flipped from Democratic control to Republican control. The 17th congressional district, located in Westchester, Putnam and Rockland counties also flipped to Republican control, by a margin of 0.8 points. All of these districts were rated as leaning Democrat before the election, but flipped to the Republican Party, helping give Republicans their narrow House majority.
Zeldin focused his campaign on crime, and the rising crime rates in New York City. He showed that many people living in the suburbs of the city cared about this issue, as he won these previously Democratic-won counties by double digits. 
In Florida, Republicans had a victorious night as well. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) was re-elected by 19.4 points, much higher than his 2018 margin of 0.4 points.
Outside of New York and Florida, Democrats outperformed expectations in many states. In the Senate race in Washington, incumbent Sen. Patty Murray (D) faced a challenge from Republican Tiffany Smiley. The contest was looked at as a close race, however Murray pulled through by 14.6 points. This margin was much higher than many of the polls, which showed Murray winning by single digits. 
Democrats shocked many in Arizona, a swing state that less than a decade ago was solid Republican territory. Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs was elected as the governor of Arizona, defeating Republican candidate Kari Lake by a razor-thin margin of 50.3 percent to 49.7 percent. Almost all polls showed Lake winning easily.
Democrats also flipped one of the U.S. Senate seats from Republican control in Pennsylvania. Lieutenant Gov. John Fetterman (D) defeated Television personality Dr. Mehmet Oz (R) by 4.9 points, while many polls showed Oz winning. 
Data showed that young voters helped deliver many of these wins. The Hill reported that 70 percent of voters aged 18-29 voted for Fetterman in Pennsylvania. This figure was very similar in Arizona, with Hobbs winning 71 percent of this age group.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) was re-elected by 10.6 points, higher than her 2018 margin of 9.5 points. Young voters turned out in large numbers in Michigan to support Ballot Proposition Three, which affirmed a woman’s right to an abortion in the state constitution. Both houses of Michigan’s legislature flipped from Republican to Democrat majority as well.
In Washington, 22-year old voter and LIU communications and theatre alumni Shelley Dean feels that young voters helped deliver wins in her state, as well as across the country. 
“Of course I think Gen Z has affected the midterm results. With each new election cycle there’s a new wave of youth who are eligible to vote who have been angrily watching from the sidelines. I don’t think that will change anytime soon,” Dean said.
Young voters have turned out in large numbers for Democratic candidates in the elections. Some feel that the influence that Gen Z has will continue to grow over the years. 
Michael Lyons, a 21-year-old New York resident who recently moved to the state, feels that this momentum is seen across the country.
“The youth in my home state of California and the youth of New York are relatively the same in terms of politics,” Lyons said.
As young people from coast to coast get older, people feel that their impact on elections will only grow.
“Gen Z may have had a small impact on the election because the people who make up the generation are mainly still too young to vote. They will continue to have a greater impact on future elections as they age enough to vote,” Lyons added.
Young people also feel that Gen Z can influence the political parties to change their positions, specifically making the Democratic Party embrace more progressive policies.
“I think Gen Z will continue to move more left, but the Democratic Party as a whole will continue to stay more centralized for a while longer. We have a while to go before the older generation of moderate Democrats retire and the new wave of younger more radical democrats take over. It’ll be interesting to see when and if that shift occurs,” Dean said.
Lyons agrees, but thinks that as the generation ages, their left-wing ideals could fade away.
“I feel as though they will definitely have some impact on political parties, but I don’t think anything can be said for certain. Usually when people get older, they lean towards the right. So it is possible that this could happen to Gen Z,” he said.
