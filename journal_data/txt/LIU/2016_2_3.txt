Winter Storm Jonas dropped nearly two feet of snow on parts of Long Island, according to weather.com. With more snow expected in the forecast within the next few weeks, students may have difficulty filling the time when stuck indoors. Although the weather since Winter Storm Jonas has been mild, winter is far from over. Here are a few ideas that can help pass the time if you are snowed in.
1. Netflix
Many students will probably say they spent their time indoors binge-watching their favorite show on Netflix. As long as the Wi-Fi is working, streaming services like Netflix can be the perfect way to pass the time; whether you are alone or with a group of friends. If you aren’t a subscriber to any of these, you probably know somebody who is. An easy solution would be to join them, or since subscribers are allowed multiple devices, many people may have extra devices that have not been used. Ask them if they would be willing to share their username or password. Temporarily of course.
Natalia Schaefer, a freshman business major, is one of many students who went with this option. “I stayed in and watched three seasons of The Office,” she said.
2. Games
Whether they’re video games or old-school board games, games are a great way to spend time with friends without just sitting in front of a T.V. If neither is available, look up new ones on the Internet.
3. Adult Coloring books

It is amazing how quickly time flies when coloring in all of the intricate details in each picture. Adult coloring books are a new craze that makes it socially acceptable for grown men and women to color pre-drawn pictures. They are available from a variety of retailers including Barnes and Noble, Target, Urban Outfitters or Amazon. Plus, according to an article published by medicaldaily.com in 2015 by Dana Dovey, art therapy in highly effective in relieving stress in adults.
4. Shovel

Zoey Zibor, a freshman public relations major, went home to New Jersey for the storm, where she said her hometown got more than 20 inches. “I shoveled for about three hours because the plow plowed us in,” she said. Although this may not sound like the most fun option, it is a really productive way to spend the time. If your sidewalk or driveway is all clear, try seeing if anybody in your neighborhood could use any help.
5. Schoolwork
Whether you finish your homework at the beginning of the storm, or put it off until, it has to get done eventually, so you may as well use this time inside to finish it.
6. Go Outside!

After the storm has passed, but the roads and sidewalks have not yet been touched, put on a few layers and go outside. It looks like the snow could be around for a while, so you might as well enjoy it. Grab a few friends, channel your inner child and head outside.

Memes and viral videos play a huge part in what we know today as modern comedy. Almost every other day that I log into Facebook or any other social media site, I see different examples of what people in this generation find funny. Some examples, to name a few, are the Kermit the Frog tea meme and the famous Grumpy Cat.
Internet comedy can be funny and relatable to almost anyone. Doug Robinson, who graduated in May 2015 with a B.F.A. degree in musical theater, believes that this type of comedy speaks very loudly for his generation. “The Kermit meme is a great meme and it’s so relatable to everything we know because of the Internet. We’ve all been so connected because of memes, and they make everyone laugh,” Robinson said. “I think things like Vine and [memes] are funny, but, I am not sure of [its] lasting impact. I guess no one is sure of the lasting impact of our generation’s brand of humor,” he added.
Robinson believes that people simply have a lot of free time on their hands to ‘make’ their own humor, whether it’s someone creating a meme, or uploading a funny video on YouTube. “I think those who really know how to use their free time, use it well and have made a career for themselves and everyone else is just copying [them],” Robinson said.
But, Robinson also believes that there isn’t enough substance to physical comedy today. “People now try to be clever and witty, and often times it can go over people’s heads,” he said. “I think comedy writers are often thinking ‘man how clever am I’ and the point of comedy isn’t how clever you are; it’s what you are making people realize, and if you are so smart that people are missing it, you really aren’t that smart.”
Another issue that comedy faces in the present day is the issue of political correctness. It is common for comedians to make jokes that degrade others; however, when an individual feels offended by these offensive jokes, a common response is that it is simply comedy. The question is: how far is it ok to go with comedy? Does political correctness have to be taken into consideration?
Marielisa Andaloro, a senior sociology major, believes that modern comedy can be a little bit over the top. “I went to a fundraiser and there was a comedian who just [said] really horrible things, like degrading women, so people started to actually leave,” she said. “It’s really sad that you have to use comedy to do that; to get a laugh out of college kids, when you can use it without having to o end anybody.”
Comedy can sure have a big impact on what people think. I believe it’s important that comedians have that freedom of speech, but I do think some comedians can take it a bit too far when they use degrading comments in their jokes. Of course everybody has their personal sense of humor and what may be funny to some might simply not be funny to others. However, I do believe there is a line that can sometimes be crossed.
As for comedy on the Internet, I think it so popular because a majority of comedic trends are all so relatable. Anything can be turned into a funny meme or video and it’s guaranteed to be successful as long as people actually can relate to it. However, this modern comedy doesn’t really have a long impact on the audience. Just as one meme surfaces, there is one right around the corner that will most probably make us forget the other one even existed.

Going to a play or a concert is a vivid experience. There are so many details incorporated in the performance, in addition to the performers that are often overlooked and taken for granted. However, Greg Brown, a senior technical theatre student, notices these details because of his soon-to-be profession. He is one of the people who help make the shows happen.
“I’m the tech guy. I set up for sound, lights and prepare the stage,” he said. Brown’s last project was a jazz concert, where he designed the lights to the best of his efforts. “It ended up being a bit dim and sexy and jazzy,” he described.
Brown is a busy guy to anyone’s standard. He works at the Tilles Center as a stagehand helping with lights and sound, he is a stage manager at Chaminade High School where he helps students with the light and sound designs, and does the same at Adelphi University. In addition, he is a volunteer firefighter.
Throughout the semester, his classmates are involved with just about every theatre production that comes through. “I touch on just about everything. Next weekend, we’re doing “Corpse Bride,” but the major production this semester is Bernarda Alba, a musical,” Brown said. “We work very closely with the actors and the director. We work together to present something together. We all love performance.”
The technical theatre majors have to have a wide variety of knowledge for this profession. They take electric engineering classes, sound production classes, light production classes, acting classes, costume design, the list just goes on and on. “It’s a [widespread] field,” Brown said. “And it’s heavily related to art.”
They also need to keep a wide variety of skills intact to have a job. “Paid theatre work doesn’t just jump at you without a huge resume,” Brown said. They work on a lot of different productions. “My job at the Tilles Center helps me for my other jobs as well. I get to see the best of the best,” he said, both in terms of performances and equipment. “I get to try it there before we get it at Chaminade, so I’m already familiar with it when we get it there.”

Two days after releasing his final album, legendary rock persona David Bowie passed away at the age of 69 after an on-going battle with liver cancer. His music never spoke for itself. Bowie needed to be the voice for his own tune and the face for his next album. More importantly, he never quite made the music about him, but rather about five fictional individuals camped within his alternative worlds.
Early on in his career, Bowie fashioned a traditional Beatles haircut and embodied the simple, but soothing presence of a whimsical singer-songwriter. Before leaving planet earth, his earlier music shifted between soulful Rolling Stones ballads to the occasional London pop. With the all-round entertainer mentality, Bowie finally ventured out into space, producing lightly psychedelic folk-rock with hints of progressive rock tendencies thrown into it. His second album, “Space Oddity” gave listeners a taste of the Bowie-like originality coming in full fruition.
The album’s title track, “Space Oddity”, became the poster-child song for his unique story-telling ability and reference to one of his many fictional characters, Major Tom. The late, Woody Guthrie, who was a true folk master at painting vivid images with his words, would most certainly nod his head in approval following the release of Bowie’s 69’ “Space Oddity”.
Now, with the passing of “The White Duke,” people from around the world recall and reminisce about the mysterious man from his earlier swing of multiple identities to a more refined, jack-of-all-trades Bowie of present. Stuart Berman, staff writer for Pitchfork magazine, beautifully sums up the life of the star-man by stating the following:
“David is not simply the prettiest star—he’s a constellation. No matter which Bowie you encountered—the orange-haried alien androgyne of Ziggy Stardust, the creepy clown in the “Ashes to Ashes” video, the louche lothario of the Let’s Dance era, or even the guy refereeing Derek Zoolander’s walk-offs—you were instantly disarmed by his style, sophistication, and presence.”
I just imagine to myself what people would think if Ziggy Stardust walked out onto an American Idol or Britain’s Got Talent stage. The judges probably would tell him to leave the drag at the door. Even in the 21st Century, we are still afraid of individuality expressed in its deepest sense. When David Jones (his original name) became David Bowie, he chose to disguise himself as a way to hide his shy tendencies.
Bowie’s choreographer, Lindsay Kemp first introduced to him ancient dramatic arts like commedia dell’arte, kabuki, and mime on a more grandiose scale. And like a true artist, Bowie carried these influences in his back pocket and sometimes wore them with the upmost pride.
Beyond his fluid, joyous charisma, Bowie left his final mark on planet earth in a rather grim prophetic manner with his last album, Blackstar. This album became the only album among Bowie’s extensive discography to top the UK Charts at number one. The nature and intentions of this album as Bowie continued to battle cancer remain to be a mystery. However, with his passing coming two days after its release, it is almost impossible to imagine that this album is not referencing an end of a hero and the beginning of a legacy.
In his music video, Lazarus, you finally see the theatrical Bowie coming to terms with the reality ahead of him. “Just like that bluebird,” Bowie took his flight from his makeshift stage to the great beyond, leaving audience members with unsettling wonder, but in complete admiration for their space cadet.

Love, happiness, sadness, peacefulness, contempt, anger, rage, kindness, determination.
They are all pieces. Pieces of us.
But are the pieces always meant to fit?
My love has always made you a piece of me as yours has always made me a piece of you.
Our love is a broken puzzle.
I wanna line the pieces up…
Yours and mine…
Some of the pieces don’t t you say?
Well that’s okay because the pieces don’t always have to fit the same way.
Let’s make a new puzzle.
Some pieces we’ll throw away and some we’ll cherish.
No matter the pieces the picture will always be the same.
We’ve broken each other’s hearts countless times…
Possibly an even bigger puzzle than the world itself.
I have a new way to put the puzzle known as forever together again…
Laugh your joy into my despair.
Cry your sorrow into my comfort.
Together this puzzle will be a piece of the biggest mystery of all: Life.
The journey will take time but I am no longer alone because you became my final piece…
No longer a puzzle as with you I am complete.

Despite four Pioneers scoring in double gures, the men’s basketball team came up short against arch-rival, University of Bridgeport, 100-91, on Wednesday, Jan. 27, at Hubbell Gymnasium in Bridgeport, Conn.
The East Coast Conference duel commenced with the Pioneers (13-7) jumping out of the gate with a 10-4 lead thanks to junior guard Jared Hall who scored six of the team’s first 10 points. However, Hall only played 10 minutes in the first half due to foul trouble and had four turnovers. Bridgeport (8-7) took a 41-32 advantage into the locker room. The Purple Knights ourished behind the lights of senior forward Muhammed Ahmed, who tallied 13 points in the opening stanza.
After falling behind 47-33 a minute into the second half, the Pioneers began to chip away at the deficit. Just passed midway through the second half, the Green and Gold came within four points (61-57) after junior forward Barrington Alston dropped in a lay-up.
Bridgeport would re-gain their double-digit edge (79-69), but the Pioneers used an 11-0 stretch highlighted by a trifecta via senior guard Devon McMillan, as the Pioneers went on top 80-79 with just over three minutes left. Junior forward Greg Dotson gave the visitors the lead with a pair of free throws.
It was all Bridgeport from that point on though, as the Purple Knights used one last run to put the game to bed with under a minute remaining. Although the Pioneers shot 74% from the floor in the second half, it wasn’t enough to prevent the Purple Knights from clawing out another conference win. Hall finished with 24 points and six rebounds in the contest. McMillan tallied 17 points while Dotson chipped in with 15 points and six boards.
The Pioneers received a similar fate in Oakdale, N.Y. when they lost an 89-87 heartbreaker to Dowling College on Saturday, Jan. 30, in another ECC matchup.
With eight and a half minutes to go in regulation, the Pioneers staged a 24-7 run to take an 84-83 lead with just 1:04 remaining. Hall paved the way for the Pioneers during the run with seven points. Alston continued to dominate the interior and crashed home the go-ahead dunk.
From that point on, Dowling (10-9) stole the lead away and put the icing on the cake with six free-throws in the final 48 ticks as they held the Pioneers to just one eld goal.
In the first half, the Golden Lions had control for the most part as junior forward Chris Millender collected 14 points in the final six minutes of the period. Thanks to Millender’s effort during a 24-8 stretch, the hosts held a 10-point advantage (51-41) at the intermission.
Offensively, the Green and Gold continued to shoot the ball well at over 50% from the eld and 43% from downtown. Hall led the team with 25 points, in addition to his seven rebounds and five assists. Dotson provided 18 points, five rebounds and dished out two assists while McMillan recorded a double-double with 10 points and 10 boards. Alston and sophomore forward Hunter Powell both contributed off the bench as the Delaware product had 11 points, five rebounds to go along with three steals and Powell pitched in with 10 points of his own.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers look to salvage the final game of their four-game road trip Wednesday, Feb. 3 against Mercy College in another ECC showdown at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, N.Y. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.

Rich Grillo, a junior psychology major and journalism minor from Wantagh, N.Y. is a member of the men’s wrestling team at Post. Grillo has an impressive track record as a four-time Nassau County Team Champion in high school and was New York State Champion in 2012 and 2013.
Q: What first sparked your interest into becoming a wrestler and joining the team?
A: My dad was the head coach of the youth program in Wantagh. Some of my dad’s friends and buddies from work convinced him to bring me down when I was about seven years old.
Q: Did you always want to be a wrestler?
A: No, I used to be really into baseball, but that didn’t really work out and wrestling did, so I just stuck with that and it became the best decision I’ve ever made.
Q: How did having Johnny Brush as a captain last year help you grow and become more experienced?
A: He was really inspirational because he’s been through so much and having a guy like that on the team and seeing everything he’s gone through. He’s just a regular, level-headed, cool guy with all he’s got going on for him with his wife and three kids, having a job, going to school and still coming out to wrestle.
Q: How has being on the wrestling team affected you as a student?
A: I remember I was late for a practice last year because I was out the night before and he kind of knew about it and talked to me and told me I was a really good kid and wanted me to make good decisions. After that it really never happened again.
Q: What’s your biggest goal this season?
A: I really would’ve liked to have been all-state, but things don’t always work out. I’d say my biggest goal this year is to fill in where I’m needed for the team and do whatever I can.
Q: After attending Nassau Community College for one year, what influenced your decision to come to LIU Post?
A: I wanted to come here in the first place, but I hoped to wrestle too and I heard Post was getting a team. My dad was Coach Patrovich’s high school coach back then and I found out the coach here was recruiting one of my best friends from Wantagh, Matt Langan, and my other best friend from Wantagh was with me at Nassau and we imagined the three of us together, so we all decided to come here.
Q: What goes through your mind when you’re preparing for a match?
A: I just try to relax and remember everything I’ve been through and try to stay loose. I say to myself that it’s not the end of the world if you win or lose and I just try to have fun with it.
Q: Is being competitive a part of your mentality heading into matches?
A: I’m extremely competitive with everything I do, but that’s not necessarily a good thing. Wrestling helps keep me in check and sticking with my schedule. It also keeps me in shape, disciplined and it really helps me blow off some steam when I’m stressed out.
Q: Any plans after graduating from Post?
A: I want to be a comedian because I do that now and I hope that would take off. Being a comedian is my number one focus in life right now.
Q: Can you share something interesting many people don’t know about you?
A: A lot of people don’t know that I was a triplet. My sister actually went here, but she transferred out and I had a little brother when I was a kid who passed away when we were ten years old. That’s really why I got into comedy at such a young age because I wanted to help the world. I knew how to make people laugh and realized that you can’t waste one second in life, which is why I work so hard at everything I do.
Q: Who do you most admire?
A: My little brother. He’s my rock and my guardian angel. I always think about whatever I’m going through could be so much worse. Any minute it could all end, so he’s my driving force.

The Pioneers traveled up to Connecticut to do battle with Bridgeport University on Wednesday, Jan. 27, and suffered an 82-77 overtime loss to drop to 2-17 on the season. The Pioneers got off to a strong start and kept their foot on the gas through the first half; leading 31-26 at the break. Senior forward Nyasia Davis led the squad in the scoring department at intermission with 12.
In the second half, the Pioneers extended their lead to as many as 12 points, but left the door slightly open for a Bridgeport comeback attempt. Although down by double-digits with just over a quarter to play, Bridgeport battled back and eventually tied the game at 66 late in the fourth quarter. Senior guard Khea Gibbs nailed two free throws for the visitors towards the end of regulation to send the match into overtime. In the extra period, the two teams went back and forth trading baskets, but Bridgeport had the last laugh as they hung on for a wild 82-77 victory.
Davis ended up scoring a team-high 21 points and grabbing 10 boards for a double-double while Gibbs tallied 19 points of her own. Junior forward Melsha Messam also chipped in, scoring 13 points and snagging nine rebounds.
The Pioneers looked to right a couple of wrongs when they payed a trip to Dowling College on Saturday, Jan. 30. Led by a career-best 24 points from senior guard Jalyn Brown, the Pioneers cruised to a 90-63 win. The win was their third of the season and by far their largest.
It didn’t start that way though as the Pioneers got off to a sloppy start, but quickly responded with a short 11-2 burst to get back in the game early in the first quarter. From that point on, Brown and Co. took over the game. The Pioneers shot close to 50% for the game and were dominant down low; out-rebounding the opposition by 17 and outscoring them in the paint by 20.
In addition to Brown’s 24 points, she also had four assists as well as two steals. Senior guard Quanisha Ratley contributed 19 points and nine boards while Messam had 15 points to go along with seven boards.
The Pioneers and Head Coach Deirdre Moore hit the hardwood again on Wednesday, Feb. 3, when they continue their road trip against Mercy College; a team they have yet to play this season. Tip-off is set for 5 p.m.

The university’s Chief of Staff, Dr. Jackie Nealon, has been named the new vice president of enrollment at the Culinary Institute of America, in Hyde Park, N.Y., and will not be returning to LIU.
As the Pioneer reported on Feb. 13, 2014, Dr. Nealon was appointed as chief of staff and vice president of enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications by President Kimberly Cline in 2013. According to Dr. Nealon’s LinkedIn page, before that, she spent 14 years as the Vice President for Enrollment, Communications and Marketing at NYIT. LIU Administrators would not comment about why Dr. Nealon left less than three years after becoming President Cline’s second in command. The university did not issue an announcement about Nealon’s departure.
The university’s department of human resources would not respond to inquiries regarding her last day of employment. Dean of Students, Abagail Van Vlerah, confirmed that Dr. Nealon was no longer at the university, but would not comment further. Dr. Nealon did not return the Pioneer’s multiple phone calls.
Although Dr. Nealon’s name is not listed on the Culinary Institute’s website as part of the admissions team, Dr. Nealon’s LinkedIn page states that she began her new position as vice president, enrollment management, in January 2016.
Jeffrey Kane, vice president for academic affairs, in response to the Pioneer’s inquiries about Nealon’s departure from the university, said, “We don’t comment on personnel matters. It’s a matter of personal privacy, and I wish her the best.”
