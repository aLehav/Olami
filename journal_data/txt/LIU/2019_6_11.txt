Maxime
 Devillaz (’16), the Pioneer’s co- and sole Editor-in-Chief from 
2014-2016, is a Digital Channel Coordinator for international sports 
media agency Spring Media with its hub in Stockholm.
 ”It’s unbelievable what opportunities the journalism program and not 
the least my time with the Pioneer has done for my progress and career 
in a seemingly new area of expertise,” Maxime said. ”I see great 
benefits working within the sports rights and licensing market: lots of 
travels onsite being in charge of big TV broadcasts and international 
distribution, vast networking opportunities, and possibilities to use my
 journalistic skills creatively in event-, marketing- and digital 
channel purposes.”
