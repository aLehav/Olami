Update – On Wednesday, Oct. 14 an additional 20 cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases since Oct. 10 to 33.
Editor’s Note – The Pioneer chose to keep quotes given to us by athletes anonymous out of respect for their privacy.
At least 14 students have tested positive for COVID-19 due to off campus gatherings attended by several members of various athletic teams, according to an email from Chief of Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement Michael Berthel on Sunday, Oct. 11. 
The affected students and individuals who they were in close contact with are required to quarantine for two weeks. Anyone who is in a class with a student who tested positive has been notified, according to the email. The email also states that the university will be disinfecting all impacted areas, but does not specify what areas on campus have been affected.
The university shared the email with students and staff when they became aware that off campus gatherings had occurred, according to Berthel.
“The University immediately coordinated its response with the Department of Health. We are working in close cooperation with the Department of Health on contact tracing in accordance with their Contact Tracing Program, and notifying all students and faculty who are in classes with these individuals,” Berthel said. “Anyone who had been in contact with these students would have been notified by this point.”
The incident comes soon after the NEC announced winter athletics we’re supposed to start on time on Nov. 25.
On Saturday, Oct. 10, 11 positive cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases for the two week from Sept. 27 to Oct. 10 to 19. On Sunday, Oct. 11 a new two week period that will last until Friday, Oct. 23 began, with a total of 13 positive cases being reported thus far. It is unclear how many cases are directly related to the gatherings.
All athletics have been paused for one week, and several athletic teams are currently quarantining as precautionary measures, according to Berthel.
One student athlete of a team not involved in this incident was upset because their practices have been cancelled for at least a week. 
“Everyone has been working super hard to be able to practice again, and because of a party it’s all on hold again,” they said. “None of us even heard of a party or anything and then next thing you know it’s shut down.”
The university currently has 85 students in quarantine, and 39 out of the available 50 quarantine rooms are currently in use, according to the New York State COVID-19 Report Card website.
Some athletes are afraid to speak out about the situation, fearing possible negative consequences.
“Athletes are being quiet about this incident in fear of negative repercussions from the athletic department,” one athlete said. “Although their information could be the difference between life and death to students with underlying health conditions.”
Disciplinary action against the students who attended the gatherings is being considered, according to Berthel. No details about what consequences may occur are known at the moment.
Some students, such as senior psychology major Nicole Ludwig, feel that the university needs to do a better job with enforcing social distancing guidelines on campus.
“The school needs to do more than send text messages and emails to enforce social distancing guidelines,” Ludwig said. “I’ve seen so many students walking around with their masks either below their noses or completely off without any consequences, and have even seen giant groups of friends eating together.”
In his email to the community, Berthel urged the student body to follow the university’s social distancing guidelines. 
“I understand that this pandemic has required sacrifice and you yearn for the social and emotional connection that has become synonymous with your LIU experience. We want that for you too,” the email stated. “However, the stakes are too high and we cannot take chances. Remain vigilant, renew your commitment to keeping yourself and our community safe, and act in a manner that demonstrates a genuine concern for your peers, your faculty, and your loved ones.”
Berthel would like to see the university have no new cases, which is something that can only be possible if students follow the universities COVID-19 guidelines.
“LIU will continue to respond immediately to positive cases when or if they occur. The positive test rate on campus is below county and state levels, but the university goal is to have zero cases,” he said. “All members of the LIU community are reminded to adhere very closely to LIU’s health guidelines: wear a face covering at all times when in public spaces on campus; practice physical distancing, do not gather in large groups; complete the daily health check-in; wash your hands regularly; stay home when you’re sick and seek immediate medical attention if you’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.”
Senior psychology major Sarah Ren, feels that while the university has done a good job regarding their COVID-19 protocols, the university’s dashboard does not provide enough information to keep the campus community informed. 
Ren would like to see the dashboard include the total number of cases the campus has experienced since the beginning of the semester. She feels that only showing positive cases from a two week period makes the situation appear less serious then it might otherwise be if the total number of cases were shown, and that students would be less likely to break social distancing guidelines if they had all of the information. 
Senior broadcasting major, Matthew Valentino thinks that the behavior displayed by some students is unfair to commuting students who have to put their families at risk.
“Now the students who commute and have to come on campus, but also be around their parents, or possibly grandparents, are putting themselves at risk, and everyone else around them at risk as well,” he said. “All because these kids want to have their college experience.”
Ludwig understands that the students who attended the parties most likely wanted to have a normal college experience, but thinks that what they did was reckless and dangerous.
“I think it’s very selfish to be trying to go to a party right now. I know so many people feel robbed of their college experience, and I can empathize with that, but your college experience isn’t going to mean as much to you if you find out someone you love has died from COVID,” she said. “And the longer we refuse to follow guidelines, the longer it’ll take for things to return to normal. To not follow the rules is to openly admit that you do not care about the safety of yourself or other people, and I don’t have any respect for that.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging people to get their flu vaccinations this year. With the ongoing threat of COVID-19, the CDC is asking people to do their part to keep themselves and others safe during the upcoming flu season. The university partnered with Walgreens to bring a flu Vaccine Clinic to both the Post and Brooklyn campuses on Oct. 7 and 8, 2020. 
 Some students have been adamant about getting their flu shots this year due to COVID.  “I cannot allow for my immune system to get compromised this year and then get COVID on top of it,” said Steele Whitney, a junior acting major, “ COVID made it so much more urgent to get it done.” 
 According to Whitney, the process of getting a flu shot this year felt very safe. There was no huge difference in this process besides the added use of masks. Whitney received a flu shot at a local CVS. 
 “I did feel safe getting my flu shot. There were people around, but I think it was worth the risk,” Whitney said, “ I think I still see flu shots as important, if anything, I am thankful to have a vaccine and wish we had one for COVID.” 
 Other students, such as junior international relations major, Matthew Sporrer aren’t sure if COVID-19 should be a factor in whether or not you get vaccinated.
 “I think flu shots are important for the general population to get every year, but I don’t know if they’re specifically more important this year,” Sporrer said. “I just haven’t looked into the science.”
 With the upcoming flu season, some students like Gabby Lavoie, a junior musical theatre major, are feeling an increased amount of pressure and anxiety about staying safe and healthy during this time.  
 “I am afraid of the flu now during this coronavirus time. I have heard the flu is going to be way harsher this year and I want to stay healthy,” Lavoie said, “[COVID] made me more scared of getting sick in general and it was the first time I got the shot in at least 2 years.”
  “COVID has made me more aware of how my health affects those around me. I realize that being healthy isn’t just for me but also my community” Lavoie said. 
 Lavoie believes that the Coronavirus pandemic has caused them to become more aware of not only their health but the health of the community around them. Lavoie, like many students, feels that it is important to continue to do everything that they can to keep themselves safe.

At 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Oct 9, over 40 Post students were setting up music stands, assembling instruments, and clipping headlamps over baseball caps in an empty parking lot. The members of marching band hadn’t been able to make music together for over six months, but on Oct 9, under the dim lighting of street lamps and car headlights, the night came alive with the sound of the group’s first rehearsal this semester.
 “It means a lot to me to be back in a rehearsing group of band members,” Sarah Gordon-Macey, a freshman musical theatre major and flutist with the Marching Band, said. Macey’s sentiments were echoed by the rest of the band, as the group was teeming with the excitement of being able to play together again.
 “Marching Band for me means being able to return to another creative outlet in making music and having fun with the people I got to get closer with last year,” Hannah Winston, a sophomore musical theatre major and drum player in the Marching Band, said. 
 For returning members like Winston, they’ve been looking forward to being back with their bandmates for months now. Like most school activities, Marching Band was shut down in March with the closure of campus. Still, the group has made strong efforts to maintain their sense of ensemble in spite of the pandemic.
 “Over quarantine, we would continue communicating in our own group chat and find free days to zoom all together and catch up,” Winston said. “We’ve also been keeping up with posting content on our social media pages.”
 Even though classes have resumed, Marching Band has faced unique challenges in navigating how they can safely rehearse during a pandemic.  
 “It’s been challenging to find the right space and time, and to be able to make music safely,” Winston said. In order to ensure safety, Marching Band rehearsed outside and spaced 12 feet apart from one another, which added another layer of difficulty to the group’s ability to play together. 
 “As instrumentalists, it’s a lot easier to play when we are closer to our other bandmates, just so that we can hear them,” Macey said. In order to remedy this, the drum majors used a speaker system, and whistles to communicate with the group while they’re spaced far apart. This has allowed the group to successfully play together in spite of social distancing.  With rehearsals successfully underway again, the group has also enjoyed the return of their supportive, fun-loving dynamic.
 “As soon as I joined the band, I could definitely tell that they are a very close-knit group which I’m looking forward to being a part of,” said Macey. As for returning members, they’re just as excited to be back and making music together.  “I’m happy to be making music again with the family we created last year as well as welcoming new members into the family,” said Winston.

New York Gov. Cuomo and New Jersey’s Gov. Murphy launched the COVID Alert NY application on Thursday, Oct. 1. The app has been made available on the app and google play store. This anonymous, voluntary exposure notification app alerts the user if they are in close contact with another user who has tested positive for COVID-19. 
The COVID Alert 19 is available for citizens over the age of 18 living in N.Y. and N.J. The goal of the application is to keep the citizens of both states knowledgeable to their potential exposure to the virus. This is hoped to reduce the chance of potential risk, increase an unwarranted self-quarantine, and encourage those who feel they might have been exposed to go out and take a test. COVID Alert even has an exposure notification service that activates a closeness sensing feature that uses Bluetooth technology to alert the user if an exposed person is in the vicinity. 
 N.Y. COVID Data is an app feature that displays total percent, percent, and total persons tested within a month period, along with the occurrences in testing over a daily figure and seven-day average. The Health Log feature allows users to keep track of their health by storing a history of their symptoms. Logs are kept anonymous from other app users while assisting public health researchers in fact on how the virus is affecting N.Y. and N.J. 
The COVID Alert app is suggested to be looked at as another safety protocol for the citizens of N.Y. and N.J. It has even been projected that if everyone downloaded the app and proceeded properly, positive cases would decrease. It is a way to protect the community while maintaining a sense of personal security due to the anonymity feature. 
Post students have expressed concern over the privacy matters of the application. 
“It might sound a little invasive if you don’t read the fine print, but I think it’s fine,”  first-semester graduate student Megan Settinger said. “None of my personal
information will be released, so I don’t see anything wrong with it. I appreciate the health log; I can track my symptoms easily without having to get on the phone with my expensive doctor. Plus, it helps researchers stay up to date with the virus. Whatever it takes to help us get back to normal faster, I’ll do it.” 
Some students believe the COVID Alert App is an invasion of privacy.
 “I see more potential problems arising with the applications sensing services,” first-year master’s in social work student Danielle Kerr said. “I feel this can lead to higher cases of discrimination towards those who might have been exposed in public, leading them to get kicked out of certain spaces and not enjoying certain past-times they normally do. This breach of privacy is almost like the HIV situation, where somebody proposed that those living with HIV should get a tattoo symbolizing, they have HIV. You cannot brand people for ailments. There are some people in this world who feel it is necessary to take things into their own hands and cause emotional harm, or worse, physical violence.” 
Cuomo encourages users to download the app to ensure its effectiveness.
“I understand the initial concern people may have when it comes to this app breaching their privacy, but if you think about it: it seems to be a small price to pay considering most people have social media on their phones that exposes their daily actions and content anyways,” senior and forensic science major Jahdai Hart-Hernandez said. “If everyone agreed to use this app properly and proactively, this could be a really good thing. We’re all on our phones already, might as well make it constructive.” 
The COVID Alert app is the government’s latest innovation to stop the spread and effects of the coronavirus. For more information regarding the COVID19 Alert app, visit coronavirus.health.ny.gov.
