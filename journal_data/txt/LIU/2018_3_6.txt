Diamond White, a 2017 musical theater graduate, has made it to Broadway in the musical “Dear Evan Hansen” as an understudy for the roles of Zoe Murphy, Evan’s high school crush, and Alana Beck, Evan’s classmate. She got the part in December, but she hasn’t gone onstage yet.
“It’s a dream come true, it’s what I’ve always wanted to do, and I’ve made it super soon,” White said about performing in a Broadway show. She has dreamed of it since she was six years old.
The show is about a high school senior named Evan Hansen who suffers from social anxiety disorder. After the death of one of his classmates, he fabricates a lie that ends up bringing him closer to the classmate’s family, while also giving him a sense of purpose and meaning. “I couldn’t pick a better show to be a part of because it’s a show with a strong message,” White said. “Not your typical music- theater piece where you just sing and do a tap dance; it requires serious acting, which was drilled into our heads here at Post. So it’s a dream come true. Of course, it’s amazing just being there.”
Some of White’s favorite playwrights are August Wilson and Lydia Diamond. Her favorite Shakespeare play is “Measure for Measure.” Her acting inspirations are Viola Davis, Audra McDonald and Meryl Streep. “They’re all women, and Viola and Audra are two women of color who paved the way for women of color like myself to make it, and they’re all strong actors, they’re actors first,” White said.
White credits her success to her theatre professors, including Professors Maria Porter, David Hugo and Rob Gallagher. “Rob Gallagher taught me how to sing properly; David Hugo and Maria Porter were my two main acting teachers here.”
Her one regret is that she did not get to perform in a Shakespeare play during her time on campus, but she hopes to do so one day. 
Being an actor comes with positives and challenges for White. “There’s nothing like it
in the world, like being able to slip into being someone else for a little while and live out their reality,” White said. “Some of the cons are that it does get hard, auditioning all the time, hearing ‘no’ constantly; I think actors might be some of the most insecure people, but we wouldn’t trade it up for anything.”
White would like to perform in the musical “Memphis” on Broadway. She once played Felicia at CM Performing Arts Center in Oakdale, N.Y., and she would like to perform the same role in the future.
White has had a positive experience with her fellow actors in “Dear Evan Hansen.” “My favorite person is Taylor Trensch. He’s the new Evan and he’s a star and just the kindest person I’ve ever met, so kind and down-to-earth and so sweet,” White said.
White recommends that aspiring theater actors watch and read plays, as well as study the history of theater. “It’s very important to know the history of theater, how it all started and why we have arrived to this point,” she said. “All these musicals from Broadway stemmed from somewhere, and we need to know about that.”
White describes the understudy as a “save-the-day” role. If the actors onstage get sick, have a family death or any issue of the like, it is the understudy’s job to take on the part in their absence. “We have to learn more than one role,” she said. She must be in-house for every show unless she gets sick or situations intervene.
Her advice for aspiring actors is to persevere and have dedication to the craft and a drive to improve. “It’s a hard business to break into. It’s very easy to get down on yourself and feel like you want to quit when it’s just right around the corner,” White said. “Take classes, brush up on your skills, what you don’t know–find out, what’s your weakest point? Make it stronger, make it your strength.” White believes it is important for actors to continually take classes and brush up their skills.

As February comes to a close, students on campus are stuck in a transitional period in between winter and spring clothing, and many are using layering a way to transition their on-campus style.
For Theresa Kelley, a junior double major in music education and Spanish, a transitional out fit is all about dressing for the temperature. On Feb. 15, Kelley wore a flannel from Faded Glory, paired with a Greek-lettered t-shirt from Something Greek, her favorite high-heeled boots from Steve Madden, and Aerie leggings. She layered the flannel over the t-shirt for some extra warmth.
“I would wear this for the temperature. It isn’t bright spring colors, but to me this would be a transitional outfit,” Kelley said.
Vanessa Villani, a junior photography major, said her favorite piece of transitional clothing is her J Crew vest. “It transitions from winter to spring,” Villani said, “because it is a vest and not a heavy coat.” She wore her vest layered on top of an oversized sweatshirt, leggings, brown moccasins, and a small Mickey Mouse-shaped silver necklace.
Morgan Tiggs, a sophomore health science major, wore an outfit appropriate for the transitional period from winter into spring, as well. She paired a hooded jacket with ripped light wash skinny jeans and sneakers, accessorizing with her gold watch and necklace. According to Tiggs, hoodies are the best winter apparel item because “you can always throw one on; they’re casual and comfortable.”
There are also ways to dress-up a transitional outfit. Destinee Pierre, a freshman political science major, wore a staple piece for a winter-to-spring wardrobe, a cropped sweatshirt. Her Charlotte Rousse sweatshirt also included a rose design along the sleeves, a popular 2018 trend. She wore this over a white tank from Forever 21 paired with ripped blue jeans from Fashion Nova.
For students trying to stay warm and still wear outfits that transition into spring, layering is an easy fashion option.

Spring has sprung! Soon it’ll be time to get outside, start riding bikes, relaxing in the quad, and taking walks with friends. Before we get to the fun, however, there’s something that must be done to ensure a happy and healthy next couple months, and that’s to give our homes and cars a good spring cleaning.
While none of us may be fond of cleaning, especially when over fifty degree weather is calling us, spring cleaning is a very necessary activity, especially for those of us that suffer from allergies. Although the lovely fall and winter months brought Halloween, Santa and even a New Year; it also brought mold, bacteria, dust, dirt, and stuffiness that we’ve since gotten use to. Often times we become blind to the caked up dust taking residence on the bookshelf, and we even start to consider the bunnies behind doors and under beds to be our pets, but little do we know these things are often quiet contributors to conditions such as asthma, heightened allergic responses to both foods and the environment, and skin irritations.
In fact, the Environmental Protection agency advises those who suffer from allergies of any kind as well as anyone who owns a pet, to do a full house cleaning every six months, so by the time Spring arrives, we’re all most likely long overdue! As well as the obvious surface dusting, window cleaning and tidying up, carpets should be cleaned with soap and water, and chairs, couches and beds should be thoroughly vacuumed.
Spring cleaning also elicits psychological reactions: going through junk mail, getting rid
of unwanted clothes and items, and rearranging rooms have been proven by the American Psychological Association to reduce stress and encourage productivity.
It’s no wonder why spring cleaning has been a ritual of our past for decades. Three or four hours, a vacuum and some gloves seem like a small price to pay for purer air and a clearer head.

“The Sun and Her Flowers” is the second book of poetry by Rupi Kaur, author of “Milk and Honey.” Released Oct. 3, 2017, the book focuses on Kaur’s personal growth in terms of life and relationships. The book is split into five sections of short poems, entitled “Wilting,” “Falling,” “Rooting,” “Rising,” and “Blooming.” 
In “Wilting,” Kaur’s poems focus on themes of abandonment, loneliness, and sadness. In one poem, she writes, “It isn’t what we left behind / that breaks me / it’s what we could’ve built / had we stayed.” This poem shows her emotional response to losing the opportunity to grow with the one she loved.
Throughout the next section, “Falling,” Kaur focuses on her own body image issues and her lack of self-worth. She discusses feeling a disconnect between her true self and who she has become, and writes “It felt like you threw me / so far from myself / I’ve been trying to nd my way back / ever since.” This poem is accompanied by an illustration of a gure of a man and his shadow, with the shadow representing her disconnect from herself.
Throughout “Falling,” Kaur’s poetry changes in tone, discussing the process of growth and turning towards positivity. In one short poem, the author writes “Like the rainbow / after the rain / joy will reveal itself / after sorrow,” showing that she believes her sadness is not permanent. This could evoke a feeling of hope in readers, who see Kaur beginning to heal after sadness.
“Rooting,” the third section of the book, focuses on Kaur’s relationship with the world, and how she feels about immigration and the borders between people. She also focuses her poetry on her mother, who was an immigrant. The themes of childbirth and lineage permeate this section, which could connect to readers who, like Kaur, have familial bonds to those who have immigrated.
In “Rising,” Kaur shows herself beginning to love again. She writes “If you got any more beautiful / the sun would leave its place / and come for you,” showing that she has fallen hard for a new person, and she has opened herself to the possibility of real love.
In the final section, “Blooming,” the author’s healing and growth has given her insight into herself and the world. In a poem titled “legacy,” she writes “I stand / on the sacrifices / of a million women before me / thinking / what can I do / to make this mountain taller / so the women after me / can see farther.” Readers can see Kaur’s journey as an inspirational path towards self-acceptance, as she tries to spread her self-love on to others.
On the last page of the novel, Kaur writes an inspirational message to her readers, telling them through metaphor that there is never a time when they should give up hope. “We might not hear it at times, but the music is always on. It just needs to be turned louder. For as long as there is breath in our lungs, we must keep dancing.”
“The Sun and Her Flowers” is an inspiring book that highlights Kaur’s internal growth. Kaur’s poetry shows that one can prevail through heartbreak and anyone can learn to love themselves. For those that want to grow in self-love, “The Sun and Her Flowers” is a book of poems that will motivate any reader to live life to its fullest potential.

Karina Cuba, a senior art education major, explored themes of marine life and pollution with works that call the viewer to take action in her exhibition “Out of Sight, Out of Mind,” shown at the S.A.L gallery from Feb. 27 to March 3.
Cuba first became interested in marine life in high school when she took a course in marine biology. “I decided to do my senior project on marine life because I am so interested in it, and my professor told me to take it a step further and discuss a cause, so I decided to create a project surrounding pollution and how it affects marine animals,” Cuba said.
The mediums Cuba used to explore the topic of pollution included photography, drawings, sculpture, and ceramics, each illustrating a different effect of marine pollution. On the walls, pelicans made of wire were positioned next to discarded plastic cups, spoons, and other repurposed litter.
“The pelicans will scoop up the garbage while trying to catch fish,” Cuba said. “They then will die from starvation because they do not realize what they are eating isn’t food.” According to National Geographic, plastic trash is found in 90 percent of seabirds.
A sculpture of a whale tail constructed from litter stood in the center of the gallery. “Every piece of that [whale tail] was collected from the bay,” Cuba said. “Even the horseshoe crab shell, which was stuck on wire on the shoreline, and had probably died there from not being able to get back into the water.”
A ceramic sea turtle was another focal point of the show. Having taken six months to complete, Cuba said it was the most time-consuming piece to create. “I started with newspaper and plastic, and formed clay around it,” she said. “The shell is bent by the six-pack of soda plastic wrapped around it. A baby sea turtle can get trapped in this plastic, and then their shell and even their organs grow in the shape of it.”
The most important thing about her work, Cuba said, is inspiring others to be more aware of environmental pollution and make changes in their lives to prevent it. “I hope people have a change in lifestyle. Use less plastic plates, and more biodegradable options,” she said. “You don’t have to just throw things away. You can reuse them to make something beautiful.”

Students often have to juggle many things at once such as unending essays and tests. However; a college student’s schedule may not be as strenuous as they think. During her time on campus, 2017 graduate Alex Lynn balanced dual undergraduate majors in physics and math and the forward position on the women’s soccer team in addition to a thriving music career. Some students knew her by her stage name, Alex the Astronaut. Universal Music publications scouted the Australian pop artist in her senior year. Most of her music videos include the lights and skylines of New York city, along with her former teammates and friends.
Lynn’s former teammate, Gabrielle Clark, sophomore political science major, is astonished by how Lynn excelled in everything she took on. “By day, she was the quirky friend, teammate, genius everyone couldn’t get enough of, but by night she was the most relentless song writer,” Clark said.
Lynn moved back to her home in Sydney after graduating with a 3.94 GPA and a contract with Universal Studios, ready to invest all of her time into her music. “It’s weird moving home; it’s like moving to a new country,” Lynn said. The experience has been a drastic transition for Lynn, for reasons including leaving her pet dog, Martin, behind in the U.S. He now lives in Lynn’s New York home with her former teammate Tiffany Reyes.
The singer writes songs about her life experiences, and this refreshing honesty is what makes her successful as an artist, according to Caitlin Johnstone, junior health science major, and Lynn’s friend and fan from New Zealand. “She is true to who she is,” Johnstone said. “Her unique style is what draws you in, and it helps that she’s a great story-teller,” she said.
Lynn released her second extended play (EP), “See You Soon,” on Oct. 2, and she has since been touring in Australia and gaining popularity across the globe. She has a large fanbase in Germany and the United Kingdom, according to her.
Her latest single, “Not Worth Hiding,” had over 1 million listeners on Spotify and caught the attention of pop icon Sir Elton John who gave her a shoutout on his national radio show. The song describes Lynn’s experience coming out as gay and growing up knowing she wasn’t like the “other girls.” Clark spoke about how Lynn is an inspiration for many people. “She has become such a strong role model for people, especially in the gay community, as she demonstrates how to succeed at being your raw self,” Clark said. “She is not afraid to write about controversial or political topics and express a clear view.”
So what’s next for Alex the Astronaut? She is set to tour Australia through April with her friend and fellow singer Stella Donnelly. Lynn has yet to set dates to return to New York, but will travel to Brighton, England to perform her concert, “The Great Escape” on May 7.
Despite all the hustle and bustle of a musician’s life, Lynn loves what she does and is thankful for the opportunities she’s been lucky to have. “Music is great; I’m like a real adult now,” Lynn said. To stay up-to-date with Alex the Astronaut, follow her on Instagram @alex.the.astronaut or on Facebook at Alex The Astronaut.

The point guard position is one of the most crucial roles on any basketball team, and sophomore criminal justice major, Jared Rivers, performed it outstandingly during this past season. Rivers scored 30 points against Roberts Wesleyan college on Feb. 25. “I was locked in, I was in the zone,” he said.
His efforts helped lead the team to victory with 86-80 points, and this propelled them to an ECC playoff game on their home court against Molloy College.
Rivers has had a fun experience during his two years on the men’s basketball team. His most memorable moments were joking around with his teammates and scoring his career high of 41 points in a game against Post University. The most rewarding part of the season was spending every day with his teammates; getting strong enough to advance to playoffs. “That was one of our targets; we accomplished that goal,” Rivers said. Having the home atmosphere of their own court and cheering fans was an advantage that helped keep up the team’s energy.
“I’m very aggressive and score great for myself and for my teammates,” Rivers said. According to him, he has an unselfish style of play, and his teammates are just as competitive as he is. Their success depends greatly on their teamwork, “I feel like when one person can pass, the whole team’s morale is boosted,” Rivers said.
“We get along great,” Austin Kennedy, freshman general business major, said, “I’ve played basketball forever, but this is one of the better teams of people I’ve gotten along with. We’re all like a family.” Both players consider keeping a sense of community within the team to be very important.
According to Kennedy, Rivers is one to lead by example. “He tries to lead us with his scoring, and he carries us on almost every game,” Kennedy said, “On off the court, he’s trying to help us, the younger guys, in certain situations.” Rivers has helped Kennedy to stay confident playing the point guard position. “It’s a big role for me to play as a freshman,” he said.
Playing at one’s best requires overcoming a number of obstacles, and for Rivers this was maintaining his grades while going to practice and class on a daily basis. As the season progressed, Rivers played more minutes on the court, typically up to 40. He found staying positive was a hurdle he had to overcome while playing for extended periods of time. “[I have to] stay hydrated and keep my body right and healthy,” Rivers said. “We faced a lot of challenges, everyone goes through adversity, individually and as a team,” Kennedy said. Though the team did not advance past playoffs, they maintained an optimistic perspective on their game play. “[We’ve] just got to keep striving and keep working,” Kennedy said.
As the top scorer, Rivers’ performance is a key element to the team’s victories. “It really does help us to the greatest extent, he’s always putting the ball in the basket,” Kennedy said, “He comes out every night and performs, and that’s just what we need from him.”
Rivers has been playing basketball since he was five years old, and it has had a significant impact on his life. “I don’t know where I’d be if I didn’t play basketball. It means the world to me,” he said.

The number one seed women’s basketball team was defeated the number four seed New York Institute of Technology in the final seconds of the ECC Semi finals on March 3.
NYIT’s, Maia Hood, grabbed an offensive rebound and scored the game-winning layup with 0.7 seconds remaining on the clock, leading NYIT to the 80-78 victory. The win secured the Bears a spot in the championship game.
The Pioneers scored a season-high 31 points in the first quarter and had a 45-29 halftime lead over NYIT. Despite the 16-point advantage, the Bears clawed their way back eventually leading to their victory.
Sophomore sports broadcasting major, Mikaiya Moore, led all scorers with 19 points, four rebounds and three assists on 9-of-13 shooting. Senior political science major, Sasha Patterson, extended
her double-double streak to six games with 10 points and 11 rebounds. Along with 13 points, seven rebounds, and four assists from sophomore physical education major, Taylah Hudson.
“We definitely learned that we can not take any team for granted,” Moore said. “Just because we were the number one seed doesn’t mean the championship was going to be handed to us.”
Despite the loss, the Pioneers’ season has been extended with a berth in the 2018 NCAA Division II Tournament announced during the NCAA selection show on March 4. Now the number six seed in the East Region, the Pioneers will battle number three seed University of the Sciences at Stonehill College on Friday, March 9 at 12 p.m. in Easton, Mass.
The Pioneers’ 22-7 overall record (17-1 in conference play) is double the number of wins last season. It will be the team’s fifth appearance in the 64-team tournament in the last 10 seasons and the first since 2013-14, when the Pioneers reached the Sweet 16 before falling to eventual national Champion Bentley University.

The men’s basketball season ended on Feb. 28 with a 71-66 loss to Molloy College in the first round of the East Coast Conference Championship.
With less than 10 minutes into the game, before a large crowd at the Pratt Recreation Center, the Pioneers had a 20-4 lead coming from effective three- point shooting from senior business administration major, Aary Bibens, who ended up racking up 11 points in that half.
Senior economics major, Kyle Taylor-McCleggan, also scored eight points. At the end of the first half, the Pioneers were leading with a score of 36-28 and showing their stellar offense by contesting all 13 of Molloy’s attempts from three-point range.
As the second half started, an amped up crowd started to silence when Molloy slimmed the lead down to three points and eventually tied the game with 49 points in just less than 10 minutes left in the game.
The two teams swapped leads until Molloy capitalized on a three pointer, putting them in the lead with a score of 63-60. Molloy went on to defeat the Pioneers in a heart breaker, with a final score of 71-66.
Not only does this mark the end of the season for the Pioneers, but also the college basketball career of senior criminal justice major, Hunter Powell, Mc-Cleggan and Bibens.

Coming off a victory against Southern New Hampshire University on Feb. 24 in their home opener, the women’s lacrosse team planned to keep that momentum going into the matchup against Bentley University on Feb. 28.
The home matchup against Bentley’s Falcons started off quickly with a goal in less than seven minutes by freshman health sciences major, Jamie Alvino, assisted by sophomore digital art and design major, Angela Deren.
Eighteen seconds later, the Pioneers scored another goal, this time by sophomore criminal justice major, Brianna Feldman, assisted by Deren. Deren then scored two more goals in three seconds.
Later in the first half, sophomore health sciences major, Paige Sherlock, scored her fifth and sixth goals of the season, both unassisted. To end the first half, sophomore criminal justice major, Alyssa Mallery, scored her third goal of the season and Feldman closed the first half with her second goal of the game. The first half ended with a score of 8-1.
Less than seven minutes into the second half of the game, Deren picked up her third and fourth goal of the game, and eventually picked up assist number three by feeding the ball to Feldman for the Pioneer’s fourteenth goal of the game. The game ended with a score of 15-5 in favor of the Pioneers.
“I go into every game with the same plan every time, which is doing the little things and play my role that I’ve been working on during practice,” Deren said about the team’s victory after the game. “I never have a planned number of goals or assists, I just play my hardest and hope to provide for my team.”
