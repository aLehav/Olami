Julian Wilson (’16), was the Pioneer’s Opinions Editor during his senior year at LIU Post. He began as a staff writer and then became the assistant opinions editor before becoming opinions editor. With a love for audio and writing in his heart, Julian took his interests head on, taking broadcasting as a major, while pursuing music and journalism on the side.
Aside from working on the Pioneer, he also worked as a staff member for WCWP, the LIU Post campus radio station. After graduating, Julian took a leap of faith and tried something he never had before; working temporarily as a student leader as part of the Summer Honors Institute camp. He worked for a week at Post, leading and teaching high school students about radio and the etiquette that follows in the field.
