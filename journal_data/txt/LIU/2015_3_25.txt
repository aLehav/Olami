The Runway club is hosting its annual spring fashion show on March 27 at 7 p.m. in the Tilles Center. Tickets are being sold in Hillwood Commons at a table in front of the Treat Shoppe during common hour, and cost $5 for students and $7 for non- students.
The theme of this year’s fashion show is the experience of being on television. The event will start out with a red carpet and cocktail hour. During the show, the audience will be able to watch typical television programming along with the main event, which will include celebrity news, and regular news broadcasts.
Thirty models, along with Jennifer Mejia, a junior Art Therapy major who is the president of the club, decided to name the fashion show “Mass Damage” and have it followed by the hashtag #TheMachine.
“The Runways’ ‘Mass Damage’ fashion show is a really unique and exciting event that the club has worked really hard for. It’s an event I’d recommend everyone attend,” said freshman Political Science major Adam Hornbuckle, the student government liaison to The Runway club.
This year, 100 percent of the proceeds from the show will be donated to Relay for Life. Last year, the club made approximately $1,000 in profits, and hopes to do the same this year. As for the types of clothing that will be showcased during the fashion show, the club preferred to keep that information classified. However, The Student Body boutique will debut items they sell in store during the fashion show.
The Runway club has two main goals. First, the members of the club strive to build self-esteem, and promote love. Second, the club teaches members to accept themselves for who they are. “I feel this is extremely crucial today because as a society we still lack acceptance in oneself. Before, everyone strived to be a size zero and tall. Now, society says that people like Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez have “broken” that mold. I completely disagree because all that they have done was change the [way] young girls feel they need to look like,” Mejia said.
In past semesters, The Runway club has teamed up with the “Stop Bullying Campaign” and “You are Beautiful” to help promote self-love and self-esteem. The models seen in the show are students of different backgrounds, body types, and college majors, with one thing in common; they are all passionate about fashion. All of the designers, photographers, and performers involved in the show are LIU Post students. The runway gives them a platform to expose their talent.
“My favorite part about being involved in such a wonderful club is everything that it stands for. It has allowed me to push myself and be a strong student leader. I also love the new relationships and entrepreneurial skills it has enhanced in me,” Mejia added.

A fundraiser for Huntington’s disease research will be held on the Great Lawn in front of Hillwood Commons on Wednesday, April 1, from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The event, organized by senior Film major Michael Mirabella, will involve student donations and culminate in visuals that include a release of balloons into the sky. These balloons will have info cards about the disease, meant to literally, as Mirabella puts it “raise awareness.”
Huntington’s disease is a rare genetic condition that affects and breaks down nerve cells in the brain over time. Mirabella will be operating a table for the event, as well as have a film team present to produce an online video. Funds will be donated to the Huntington Disease Society of America, an organization that Mirabella has been in contact with to help guide his process. “They are participating by supplying brochures about the disease to [hand out] to students, and will likely be sharing the video,” Mirabella said.
“I had been interested in doing something charity-driven for a while,” Mirabella added. “Given my background in film, I figured I’d make some kind of charity video, which led me to consider getting the whole school involved since it wouldn’t be much of a fundraiser if it was just me walking around with a balloon.”
After contacting Campus Life Coordinator, Arianna Livreri, Mirabella was able to branch out and involve several clubs in the project. These clubs, who will participate in the video, assist in running the donation table, and setting up the event include Circle K, Do Something, and the Kickline team.
“We’re leading the [interested] students out to the Great Lawn with a small routine. Then as the balloons [are] released we will be in front of everyone doing a small dance routine as well,” said Emily Lagonigro, a junior Criminal Justice major and president of Kickline.
Mirabella decided on fundraising for Huntington’s disease research after a conversation with his brother, who is a doctor. “I asked him what a good disease is to raise money for that is fairly unknown,” he explained.
LIU Post has been home to several fundraising events, including cancer research, arts fundraisers, and even an effort to save a slaughter- bound miniature horse by the equestrian team. The university will hold their Relay for Life event on Friday, April 17 at 5 p.m.

Delta Zeta has been added to LIU Post’s Greek life, joining the two Panhellenic sororities already on campus. According to the 22 founding members, they had shown interest in being a part of Delta Zeta during annual spring recruitment, and were assisted by Educational Leadership Consultant Cindy Park.
According to the Constitution of the Delta Zeta Sorority, the organization seeks to unite its members and create long lasting bonds of friendship and sisterhood, which is something that founding members already feel after just three weeks.
“Delta Zeta is committed to providing educational programs and leadership opportunities that enrich the lives of young women,” a spokesperson from the National Headquarters of Delta Zeta said. “The Delta Zeta experience is a transformative one for [it’s] members, and we look forward to bringing that experience to the women of LIU Post.”
“I’ve only been a part of the sorority for a short period of time, but I can already feel a connection with the other girls, and I now understand that aspect of being a [part of] sisterhood,” Marisa Kofmehl, a junior Public Relations major said. “I knew a couple of the girls before I was officially in the sorority, and they were kind of the final push I needed to decide to actually join. But I didn’t know a lot of the girls before, and although we’ve only been sisters for a few weeks, I already feel like I’ve found my home.”
Kofmehl stated that although there were other sororities on campus that she could have joined, she never really felt interested until she started to go to some Delta Zeta informational events. “I feel like there was a different vibe [with] this group of girls. There were always good vibes coming from the other sororities on campus, but when choosing a sorority, you pick the one where you feel at home with, and that’s what I felt with Delta Zeta. It just felt more like where I belonged,” said Kofmehl.
Delta Zeta’s bid day took place on Wednesday, March 4. Kristin Esbin, a senior Education major, another founding member of the sorority, said, “It was very different from what we normally see, and it was exciting because we didn’t know if we were going to have the support, but it was really nice to see that we actually did have it, and that a lot of people came out to bid day for us.”
The Greek organization had its first sacred event on Monday, March 16, which was their pinning, the beginning stage of the new member process where the girls pledge their time and effort to the sorority. Although the founding members stated that they can’t share the ritual with non-members, they seemed to be very content with how it turned out.
Since they are a new sorority on campus, the founding members received a Panhellenic big sister, which means girls from other sororities on campus were assigned to be “bigs” for the sisters of Delta Zeta. “I think that was a fabulous idea because we are all new to Panhell Greek Life, and we don’t really know what it’s about, so it’s nice to have those big sisters to guide us in the right direction,” said Kofmehl. “We’ve seen things, we’ve read things, we have a general idea of what Greek Life is about, but having [a] big is nice; it’s guidance.”
Delta Zeta has two main philanthropies, for which the girls in the sorority would do community service for; these are the Painted Turtle and the Philanthropy of Speech and Hearing. “The Painted Turtle is a year-round summer camp in California, and its main mission is
to give ill children the camp experience without them having to feel misplaced [or] different [from] the other kids,” said Esbin.
Both Esbin and Kofmehl believe that being a founding member of the Delta Zeta chapter at Post is a great thing. “I feel that being a founding member is quite the honor,” said Kofmehl. “It’s a big responsibility, but it’s a great one, and I am proud of not only being able to be under that title, but to be a part of such a great family.”
“Founding members, not unlike Delta Zeta’s own founders who established the sorority in 1902, lay the groundwork for future chapter members to build upon,” said Delta Zeta’s National Headquarters representative. “Each founding sister signs the charter, which represents the chapter’s beginning and the special meaning of founding a sorority on the LIU Post campus, [It] inspires not only the charter members, but all members of that chapter, and its future members as well.”
Students interested in becoming a founding member should contact Park at cpark@dzshq.com, who will also be on campus to guide and help any interested students.

From the WCWP Alumni Chapter:
I wanted to take a moment to thank you for the wonderful article about our 50th anniversary celebration at WCWP. It was a pleasure meeting both Alyssa Seidman and Tia-Moná Greene. They took the time to really get the feel of what was going on at the station Monday. My concern about such a piece is having someone simply walk in and not understanding the emotions of those us who have been around the station for so many years and what that day was about. This article and pictures captured the day perfectly.
If our alumni group can be of help to The Pioneer on some future project, don’t hesitate to ask.

The LIU Post Newman Catholic Community Club is hosting a dance for Cerebral Palsy in the Tilles Center Atrium on March 26 from 6 p.m. – 9:30 p.m. The event is being held to raise awareness for cerebral palsy, and to give the students of LIU Post the opportunity to experience something that will truly change their perspective on mental health, according to Maggie Garcia, an undeclared sophomore and the treasurer of the Newman Club.
More than 100 people who have cerebral palsy will participate in the event, which they consider to be their “prom.” There will be about 30 vans that are wheelchair accessible carrying about four or five people each from residences all over Long Island who are associated with United Cerebral Palsy, a nonprofit agency in New York City.
“Do you remember how excited you were for your high school prom? This is exactly how they feel. They look forward to this day all year [long]! The whole dance is just an amazing way to dance and sing like nobody is watching,” Garcia said.
“Who doesn’t love to dance?” Garcia asked. “Using “dance” as a way to gain awareness for this disability is our way to show that even with all the struggles and disabilities we face in life, dancing and great music is one of the ways we can all come together.”
The dance for Cerebral Palsy is just one of the ways that the Newman Club tries to raise awareness to important issues. “The purpose behind this event and most of our events is to bring awareness and help those in need,” said Reyna Romero, a sophomore Early Childhood Education major, and Vice President of the Newman Club. “Not only through our special event like [the dance for cerebral palsy], but many others like our soup kitchens, [whose] main purpose is to feed the hungry.”
Garcia said that matters of religion and race are irrelevant when it comes to what really matters. “It does not matter what religion or race you affiliate yourself with, we all have one thing in common: the need to make a change,” she said.

The George Polk Awards will be presented at a luncheon on April 10 at The Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan from 11 a.m. – 2 p.m. The George Polk Awards for journalism were founded by LIU in 1949 to memorialize CBS correspondent George Polk, who was killed in 1948 while covering The Civil War in Greece.
Students can attend the luncheon by purchasing tickets in advance for $100 each, at https://community.liu.edu/Polk. “Although students have to buy tickets to attend, student tickets are dramatically discounted,” Michael Glickman, LIU’s Chief of Strategic Partnerships and University Advancement, said. The original cost for an event ticket is $250.
The Polk Awards recognize and award brave reporters, instead of news organizations or publishers that are more commonly emphasized. The goal is to award and bring to light courageous reporters committed to informing the public, even at the risk of their own life and liberty. The awards, given out each spring by LIU Brooklyn, support and celebrate pioneering journalists who work across all media, making The George Polk Award one of America’s most prestigious and desirable journalism awards.
The awards are granted to journalists who show excellence and originality in their reporting on serious and secretive matters such as abuse of power, the endangered public, corrupt officials, war criminals, and corporate cheats who circumvent the poor. Reporters are also awarded if their stories accomplish results such as raising awareness for important issues.
The prize has honored work across all media platforms, and winners are named each year in almost a dozen categories. The list of winners varies from the biggest names in journalism, such as Sidney Schanberg, Christine Amanpour, and Seymour Hersh, to non-prevailing reporters. However, on occasion, an award is given to people outside of the news reporting profession, such as when Oliver Sacks, an author and neurologist, was rewarded for his article “An Anthropologist of Mars”, “An Anthropologist on Mars”Polk Award for Magazine Reporting, “An Anthropologist on Mars” Polk Award for Magazine Reporting, “An Anthropologist on Mars”in 1994.
The winners are chosen from among hundreds of nominees that are referred by the Polk Advisory Board, which is a panel of news-business influencers. In addition, nominations are welcomed from reporters, the public, and news organizations. A jury of educators and communicators that has a connection to the university makes the
final judging. At the awards luncheon, honors are paid to journalists who have died in the line of duty. A list of the deceased, assembled by the Committee to Protect Journalists, is read to memorialize them, and to bring attention to the danger journalists face when covering serious matters, as well as symbolizes why the Polk Awards is of much importance.
LIU Brooklyn’s journalism department will hold a George Polk Seminar, which is a discussion about the award-winning efforts of prize recipients. The seminar will be held on April 9 at the Kumble Theatre at LIU Brooklyn from 5:30 – 7:30 p.m. Reservations can be made at info@kumbletheater.org or 718- 488-1624. “The seminar is open to everyone, Post is very much a part of the Polk awards, and we would love to see Post students attend the seminar,” Glickman said.
Sandra Mardenfeld, the director of the Journalism program at Post had no comment about the Polk awards because she said that Post is not a part of the ceremony.
“The Brooklyn campus has different programs than Post and vice versa,” Glickman said, explaining why LIU Brooklyn hosts the Polk Awards and not LIU Post. “Post has the Tilles Center, which [Brooklyn doesn’t]; there are some differences [between the campuses]. [But], the [Polk Awards] seminar is a LIU community event, where Post alumni, faculty and students are welcomed”.
“I wouldn’t go all the way to the Brooklyn campus for the Polk seminar,” said Errol Nicholson, a junior Journalism major.
At this year’s awards ceremony, the Award for Foreign Reporting will be given to Politico’s Rania Abouzeid for an extensive and authoritative account, “The Jihad Next Door: The Syrian Roots of Iraq’s Newest Civil War.”
The George Polk Award for International Reporting will be given to Rukmini Callimachi for her article, “Paying Ransom, Europe Bankrolls Qaeda Terror,” published in The New York Times on July 29, 2014. “
The George Polk Award for National Reporting will be given to Carol Leonnig of The Washington Post, who will be recognized for a series of exclusive reports including, “Secret Service Fumbled Response after Gunman Hit White House Residence in 2011” and “White House Fence-jumper Made it Far Deeper into Building than Previously Known”.
The George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting will be given to James Verini of National Geographic, for “Should the United Nations Wage War to Keep Peace?” a fascinating and prolifically illustrated 11,000-word story.

Looking for an inexpensive way to brighten up your spring or summer wardrobe? You’re not alone. Many students are looking forward to shedding their heavy sweaters and winter coats for shorts, t-shirts and summer accessories, and want to add some inexpensive, new items to their closets.
Online shopping is easy for college students with busy schedules who don’t have time to drive to the mall, especially students who live on campus and don’t have a car. Polyvore.com is a website where you can find shoes, clothes, handbags, and even accessories. Polyvore allows you to create an account for free and shop for clothes by brand, or by category. Whether you are looking for something casual or fancy, Polyvore can easily help you find what you need at an affordable price.
Zappos.com, which is similar to Polyvore, but with a lot more brands and clothing variety, is also a place to shop for both men’s and women’s attire. These sites appeal to college students because they sell clothes that fit the style of a young adult and students can find just about any article of clothing they are looking for.
If you do have a car and time, there are stores nearby where you can shop without breaking your bank account. TJ Maxx is located on 90 Northern Blvd. in Greenvale, and offers a variety of designer clothes, shoes and handbags at discounted prices. Payless, located at 630 Old Country Road in Garden City, has quality shoes for any occasion beginning at around $20. Another store where you can shop for your spring wardrobe is Mandee, located at 3373 Hempstead Turnpike in Levittown. Mandee has high sales so you can purchase a lot for your money.
Students can even buy clothes right on campus, at The Student Body Boutique, which opened last year, and is located on the second floor of Hillwood Commons. The boutique, which employs students, is a good place to shop if you need something quickly, or don’t want to leave campus. The prices vary depending on whether it is new or old merchandise, and they also have sales when there’s a holiday approaching or a special school event. The Student Body Boutique is open Monday through Friday from 12:30 p.m. – 8 p.m.
“The spring merchandise we are selling now is great and really cute,” said Perla Marte, a freshman Criminal Justice major who works in the boutique. “We also have a couple of new dresses.”

Six Below with a chance of snow? Yep, we had that; eight degrees, a week in a deep freeze? Yep, we also had that; school, class, practice? Ha, yeah we barely had a full week of that!
This past winter has been one of the worst on record in the history of New York, according to weather.com. Oh, and it gets worse: this winter was the coldest winter on record for the entire eastern seaboard. It was even 39 degrees in Miami one night in early February. It was one of those winters when one would say, “Hey, maybe this whole global warming thing doesn’t sound so bad after all.”
With all that said, as a student body, we somehow found our way out of the tundra and into the classroom. So I ask you, how did this modern day Ice Age affect you? Could you make it to class? I posed these questions to both commuters, and students who dorm at LIU Post, and the responses; well, they were passionate.
Bradley Thompson, a freshman Biology major who commutes to Post five times a week from Queens, disclosed how turbulent and treacherous his daily commute was, and how the trouble started just outside his house.
“I live in an apartment in Flushing, and my landlord never ever salts our staircase,” Thompson said. “So before I can even get to my car, I have to cross a manmade ice rink.” He drives a 1997 Honda Accord with heat that is off and on; usually more off than on. “Sometimes my car wouldn’t start, and I would have to take the bus to campus because I cannot miss Bio lab no matter what the cost may be.” Mind you, from Flushing to Post by bus is nearly a two-hour commute. One can’t help but admire the valiant efforts made by Thompson to be present by the time attendance was taken in his class.
Mother Nature showed no mercy this semester, even for those who live in the dorms. Aletta Salerini, a freshman Liberal Arts major, lives in Nassau Hall. She recalled the longest half mile walk of her life.
“I was running late to my sociology class,” Salerini said, which is held across campus over at the Kahn Discovery Hall. “I was underdressed, literally, I was wearing leggings, a tee-shirt and an old fleece.” Although one can’t help but wonder why anyone would leave their residence in that attire, on a frigid, 22-degree morning, Salerini later went on to tell me that she sprinted from Nassau to Kahn in under six minutes. Impressive? Yes.
However, according to Salerini, her eyes were iced over, fingers near frozen, and she could barely feel her cheeks. Moral of the story, wear an actual winter jacket! But I commend my fellow classmate for her valiant effort to make it to class.
Although, professors had no problem assigning homework on these makeshift snow days, they had trouble making it to campus too.
“The Northern State was turned into a ski ramp,” said Sandy Held, a Broadcasting and Media Arts professor. “You had to see it! Cars were sliding all over the place. Thankfully I had all-wheel drive, or else I might have been in serious trouble.”
Jorge Rosario, a Spanish professor, said, “If you can’t make it here because of the snow, I understand, I will not hold it against you.” So there you have it folks, professors actually have feelings, and go through the same hardships as you sometimes — cut them some slack, too.
Despite Long Island turning into an iceberg this winter, there was a recurring theme when it came to all those who had an obligation to Post. Whether it be students or professors, everyone tried to make it to campus. This speaks volumes of our campus; everyone did their best to keep functioning fibers of post intact. It is also worth mentioning Post’s grounds crew and public safety, who are perhaps the unsung heroes of this winter. They did their best to keep Post up and running, and never conceding to Mother Nature’s unforgiving cold streak.

This past Monday, March 23, Brian Sweeney, assistant professor of Sociology, was awarded the 2015 David Newton Award for Excellence in Teaching, along with Tung-lung Steven Chang, and Linda L. Vila. A professor gets nominated and must then submit material for review, including the professor’s syllabi, assignments, and teaching philosophy.
Sweeney has taught at LIU Post since fall 2007. He teaches courses on youth, gender, sexuality, and education. “I find the teaching part of my job very fulfilling,” Sweeney said about working closely with students. “Receiving the award provides affirmation of my commitment to work closely with students.”
Sweeney completed his undergraduate education at Ohio Wesleyan University, a small liberal arts school of about 2,000 students. He studied many subjects, including English, sociology, and anthropology. He enjoyed the social aspect of college life, because everyone was active and involved, as well as the academic part of college life. Sweeney said that “taking classes, leaning more about the world, and developing skills like writing [made me] really love my college experience.”
Since Sweeney began college, he was enthralled by sociology. “I greatly admired my professors and they seemed to have good jobs!” he exclaimed. The fall semester after his undergraduate graduation, Sweeney was back in the books in graduate school at Indiana University, and he stayed there for the next seven years.
“I had doubts at some points along the way, but I am glad I stayed on course. And now I have the job I wanted,” Sweeney said about his experience in graduate school. Starting in his third year in grad school, he was already teaching.
Sweeney pegs his Sociology of Sexuality class to always be a fun class to teach. “Most students have never taken a course related to sexuality,” he explained, “and the class is a big eye-opener.” The classes are open forums, populated by frank discussions about a wide range of sexuality-related issues. The class helps students make sense of all the confusing and harmful messages about sexuality in our current society.
When Sweeney is not teaching sociology courses, he is busy researching several subjects. First, he is looking at gender and sexuality among young adults, and writing a piece that looks at “slut stigma” and “slut shaming” for women. As fascinated as Sweeney is by the intersection of gender and sexuality, he believes that sexuality remains an important part for the production of gender difference and inequality, despite a lot of gains toward gender equality.
Sweeney believes his job in this field gives him the opportunity, however small, to try and address these social problems. The other subject he is currently researching involves studying how friendships encourage healthy and successful aging among LGBT older adults.
Sweeney still finds the time to engage in other activities. He is part of the American Sociological Association and the Eastern Sociological Society. He attends meetings to present his research and learn about the other research in the field. In 2013, he was in charge of reviewing and selecting presentations related to the sexualities section of the American Sociological Organization. This year, he will be continuing his legacy as the presider over presentations related to youth and risky behavior.
Sweeney’s students rave about his teaching technique and classes. Mikki Rosman, now a success coach with LIU Promise, decided to try several of Sweeney’s classes because she had so many electives included in her major.
“He’s not just here to teach about the course curriculum or to follow a syllabus, he teaches you about life,” Rosman said. “I was eager to learn about current events, passionate about injustice and he was right there to inform us, to spark an interest and awareness in us.”
Eliza Sefton, a senior Sociology major, said that Sweeney “puts a great amount of thought and effort into preparing for his lectures and assignments.” The classes were engaging and allowed students to question and participate with freedom from apprehension.
Myles Goldman, a freshman Forensics major, agreed that, “Dr. Sweeney was always helpful and could apply current events to sociological conversations.”
Rosman felt that Sweeney helped her grow as an individual. “Dr. Sweeney shaped my passion for helping others, for being aware of differences, and for being an activist,” she explained. Furthermore Sefton said, “As a Sociology major, he has really helped me to understand what it means to think sociologically.”
“Sweeney definitely helped me in becoming more confident in my ability to make change possible and to know that people can make a difference, him being a perfect example,” Rosman said.

“Coca-Cola Life” is the Coca-Cola Company’s first reduced-calorie sweetened sparkling beverage with cane sugar and Stevia leaf extract; and has 35 percent fewer calories than other leading colas, according to the official Coca-Cola website. Other beverages sweetened with stevia leaf extract include Glaceau Vitaminwater Zero, Honest Tea and Odwalla.
The particular way in which people prepare their coffee proves that sweeteners make a difference. From saccharin-sweetened Sweet’N Low to aspartame-sweetened Equal, low calorie sugar alternatives are plentiful. Consumers choose to use sugar substitutes to help lower their calorie and sugar intake. More than 78 million U.S. adults are obese and sugar-dense foods and beverages may be a major contributing factor, according to the Huffington Post article, “7 Things You Didn’t Know About Stevia,” published Oct. 2014. A sweet but healthy solution is in need. Stevia, an FDA-approved sweetener, is trying to be the answer. “Coca-Cola Life” is a low-calorie soda targeted toward the demographic of those who dislike the taste of diet soda. This new beverage has only 89 calories as opposed to the regular Coca-Cola, which contains 139. “Coca-Cola Life” relies on both Stevia extract and cane sugar to get its sweetness. This sweetener is calorie free. However, there are some interesting facts about it being used in “Coca-Cola Life.”
According to the Huffington Post article mentioned above, a 2014 study from the Weizmann Institute of Science showed that artificial sweeteners may have detrimental effects on our bodies that lead to an increased risk for obesity and diabetes, which is ironic considering these are the conditions many diet soda drinkers are hoping to avoid. Yet despite this one study, there’s not yet enough research to point to either stevia’s health benefits or negative side effects.
What we do know for sure is that Stevia, the sugar substitute used in “Coca-Cola Life,” is being pushed as the “natural” ingredient. Still, natural sugar water is still sugar water to the tune of four teaspoons of sugar per can. That is 25 percent of the daily recommended sugar intake for children.
I have tried the new “Coca-Cola Life.” It is much sweeter than regular cola as a result of this Stevia sweetener. There are only 24 grams of sugar in “Coca-Cola Life” as compared to 37 in regular cola. Also, there is a bit of a dry after-taste that only makes the consumer thirstier.
In my opinion, if people are looking for a low calorie drink, there are many flavored waters, even some with carbonation, that act as healthier options. If one wants to lose weight and live a healthier life, soda must be cut out as a whole. Humans should start adjusting their taste buds now.

Class ends at 4:50 p.m., but the on-campus shuttle does not pick you up until 5:25 p.m. It gets dark and you’re tired of waiting, so you decide to just walk instead. Isn’t this what the majority of students who take the shuttle have to face every day?
“The shuttle is a great service for students who have class all over campus, especially when you have a class all the way at Lorber Hall,” said Zaroon Ahsan, a senior Finance and Marketing major. “However, usually students end up waiting much longer due to the weird shuttle timings that aren’t in sync [with] class schedules.”
Last semester, I was 15 minutes late to my classes because the shuttle would leave way before the class ended. During the winter, this is the last thing someone would want to experience.
“I believe the shuttle needs to [be] more available and accessible for the students on campus,” said Ervin Gonzales, a freshman Musical Theater major.
It will be very helpful and more convenient for students who need to go to South Campus if the shuttle ran at least three times an hour. It becomes a problem when students needs to visit South Campus for ten minutes, only to end up waiting for the shuttle for at least 40 minutes.
Since morning and afternoon classes have a ten-minute gap inbetween them, it becomes an issue for students to reach South Campus or come back to the Main Campus for their next class.
“I have been left at Lorber Hall multiple times in the past, which causes me to be late for another class,” said Miki Maloney, a junior Education major. “The shuttle is very inconvenient [in this way].”
An on-campus shuttle is a free and convenient way to get to South Campus for those who can’t drive. Yet, making the schedule work better with class times can improve this service. This way, students don’t miss the shuttle or arrive late to their next class.

Throughout college, there are an abundance of happy, elated and amazing times and memories that we share and create. However, as we all know, there are also those stresses and annoyances that bring us down. For example, at the beginning of the semester, I was excited to sink my teeth into new things and was enjoying life. Yet, right before spring break, I broke my fourth metatarsal in my foot and my mood dropped. I began to feel “bovved” — meaning, I couldn’t be bothered.
Going to school became a chore rather than a place to learn new and exciting things. The week before leaving for Acapulco, my spring break destination, this became extremely apparent. So, I was hoping the time away from the stresses of school and other matters, which were becoming a burden to my serenity, would dissolve. But having a broken foot is not something you can leave behind in Hicksville.
I know many of you are feeling very much the same as I am about school and life at the moment, but the weird thing is, these feeling don’t apply when we rave it out at happy hour, or see the lights of the Big Apple on the weekends (apart from me, where I can’t exactly rave it out with the huge metal boot I have on my foot).
What can we do not to feel constantly bogged down with work or see school as a place of boredom?
One thing that has really helped me to reach my leveled karma is yoga. My partner in crime, Jason Lampkin, a junior International Business major, invited me to a yoga class at the Pratt Center — all free of charge, I might add. It was really great fun!
Sadly for us soccer players, and many other athletes, our hamstrings are pretty short and therefore so tight. At times, I must admit, I did have a few beads of sweat that seem to have their own little spring break on my forehead, throughout the session.
However it was very relaxing and helped to loosen a lot of muscles, such as the back and neck, which do suffer when stress is apparent. I seriously suggest classes like this, which happen on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5 p.m. at Pratt. Oh, and I nearly forgot to mention, you can even take yoga as a class for school credit!
Go speak to your success coach and see if you can fit it into your schedule because not only will you get easy credits, you will come out feeling almost released of all the things that were swimming around in your head before, therefore allowing you an excuse for that break you need during your revisions of essays that we spoke about a couple of weeks ago. And don’t forget to say: Namaste!
Another way to beat the feeling of frustration and stress-related anger is to simply be happy! I know, it sounds like an easy task, but being happy comes with many things. It’s not just ‘not looking angry’; it’s saying thank you, giving compliments and opening a door for someone. Since I have been here in the U.S., I have been shocked at how many people are just oblivious to others, not opening doors, not saying thank you, and for me being quite rude!
I always open the door for people — “ladies first,” etc. This may be completely different in America compared to England, but I find it totally bizarre that people don’t! I am not saying that everyone is guilty of being ignorant of other people, because there are many who do have courteous habits. However, try to make a special effort to be that one person who differs from everyone else, and pay someone random a compliment. I am probably the worst at being blunt. When I am angry or depressed, I just want to be by myself and deal with my problems, but when I want to be social and nice to others, giving them a few minutes of my day I feel as if my mood is being uplifted. Give it a try!
I gave someone a compliment about her coat the other week, completely out of the blue, and she said, “I thought it looked bad!” She said that I made her day, and then I felt good that I had made someone else feel better. So, give it a go, be the one who makes someone’s day and remember, if you are the one who is happy, smiley, opening a door for someone here, and paying a compliment there, you are going to spread that around!
P.S. For you boys, it’s been statistically proven that the majority of girls love gentlemen. Something to keep in mind!

There is a wave of street-inspired art at LIU Post this semester. Last week, Susan Kelly, a senior Art major, held her senior thesis show in the Hillwood Commons S.A.L. gallery. Her show, “HeartBeats,” had impulses from both the street world and music world, as her works are based on portraits of her favorite musical artists. The show ran from March 16 – March 20. The opening reception on Wednesday, March 18, had a gallery space crowded with students, professors, and advisors.
As Kelly pointed at one of her portraits, a painting on vinyl canvas of Korean artist Zico, she explained her inspiration. “They scanned his brain and figured out that his brain only rests like 20 percent [of the time],” Kelly said. While most people have much less brain activity at any given time, to her it symbolizes a willpower and determination that inspired her.
Kelly used the gallery space in a very tidy manner, un-crowded, and with no overfilled walls despite using varied mediums. These ranged from stencils and spray paint on a dress, to charcoal on a corkboard.
“I found that on my way home one day. Someone put it [the corkboard] outside with the garbage, and I stopped and grabbed it,” she said. “It’s been sitting around for a while, and now I finally get to use it!” The corkboard isn’t the only salvaged piece of society. Kelly had several paintings on wood that she also found on the way home. “It’s a door someone cut in half, so they fit in my car, and it’s a perfect size for my work!” she said, explaining another piece.
Kelly has also used other techniques such as screen-printing on wet clay and glass cutting to make a portrait look like stained glass. It’s all done with an eye towards street art, sharing stylistic features, including few powerful colors, simplistic motifs, and varied media. She also sneaked a piece into the “Concrete To Data” show in the Steinberg Museum of Art in Hillwood, which was curated by Professor Ryan Seslow.
Kelly had taken his class on street art, and, “as he [Seslow] was setting up [the exhibit], I went there and asked,” she said. An installation piece in “Concrete To Data” consists of cement castings, similar to Kelly’s in her own show, and now it’s a part of what she calls “Guerilla art,” where she has subtle but visible artworks around campus, including an altered Picasso poster and stencil sprays on the snow.
After she graduates in May, Kelly aims to continue her Fine Arts studies with a master’s degree at LIU Post. She’s also going to South Korea with Professor Seung Lee’s exchange program in the summer, which includes a two-week trip to different universities.
Last semester, students from the South Korea exchange program came to Post with their own show in the S.A.L. Gallery. “We’re going there and having a show at each university we’re [visiting],” Kelly added.

“Insurgent,” the sequel to “Divergent” in the series of the same name, is the latest Young Adult book to be transitioned into a blockbuster film. Though many may compare this series to “The Hunger Games” trilogy, the only resemblance I see is the fact that both stories take part in a dystopian world, and both have female heroines.
“Insurgent” is directed by Robert Schwentke, and follows up on “Divergent” as Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James), who have become fugitives, are now on the run from Jeanine (Kate Winslet), leader of the Erudite faction. Set in the distant future in Chicago, “Insurgent” goes deeper into exploring the social structure characterized in this world. We get a view into the lifestyles represented by other factions that were not seen in the previous movie, such as the Candor and Amity Factions. We even get a look at those who didn’t fit into any of the factions, better known as the factionless.
In their mission to discover what hidden secret Tris’ family sacrificed their life for, Tris and Four travel to the other factions in the hopes of discovering allies and answers. However, Jeanine does not make it easy on them since she has publicly blamed the pair for the attacks on the Abnegation faction, which took place in the last film. With enemies on their tracks, Tris and Four face challenges in the hope that they can protect the city from corrupted leaders before they get captured.
As someone who has a passion for art cinema, I think getting away with viewing a mainstream film every once in awhile is acceptable as long as the plot is engaging and entertaining. “Insurgent” is definitely entertaining, and the fact that this film includes a star-studded cast only makes it more appealing. However, as someone who has read the books this series is based on, I can’t say I was too keen about the many changes that were made between the book and the movie. The “Divergent” series, written by Veronica Roth, is a complex story that unveils layer after layer of plots twists and turns. Many of the changes in the film adaptation rush much of the overall plot, the complexity of the storyline feeling a little flat. Don’t get me wrong, I still believe the film promotes an engaging time between viewers and the story, but if I had not read the
books prior to watching the film, I might not have understood the point of this whole thing.
One of the things I love about the “Divergent” series is that it is one of the rare famous YA series adaptations that does not include a love triangle. I think that fact alone may seem very appealing to many moviegoers. The plot itself does not focus too much on the romantic aspects, which helps recognize the more crucial points of the story. However, whenever there are intimate scenes between Tris and Four, it isn’t melodramatic, and the chemistry between James and Woodley seems genuine. Apart from that, there are a lot of action sequences in this movie, but it never feels like too much, or as if the action sequences appear just for the heck of it. There is always a reason for these specific scenes, whether it was shown through a stimulation Tris goes through, or if it has to do with Four and Tris running from their hunters. These scenes never seem overplayed because, overall, they tie up plot points.
Due to the box-office success of the first film in the series, “Insurgent” benefitted from a greater budget and scope, which in turn helped with things such as the special effects. I could tell that a lot of effort was put into making the effects look so good because they look so real. Visually, the film was impressive. I did not have to visualize what a dystopian Chicago would look like because the filmmakers did an exceptional job at making me believe that what I was seeing was real, especially with all the shots of the scenery. The film’s soundtrack music isn’t as prominent as it was in the first film, but whenever music does come in, it fits perfectly with the chosen scene.
As a reader of the book series, “Insurgent” inadequately fails at matching up to its book, and disappointed in not living up to the first adaptation of the film series. However, as a separate piece of work, it plays out above average. Although this is a film that could easily be categorized as a “Matrix,” “Hunger Games” wannabe, overall it fights to stand well on its own, original dystopian pedestal.
“Insurgent” was released on March 20th and is being shown in wide release.

“The Riot Club” begins with a smashing prologue; quite literally. In the 17th century, we observe the rise of a hedonistic social club at Oxford University, named after a promiscuous and glass-smashing student who was murdered by the husband of a lover. They’re like an old school “Animal House,” priding themselves on an apparent intellectual superiority, while simultaneously taking part in party-boy antics. The club feeds on its elitism, with all of the members descendants of the rich, posh socialites of England.
Adapted from the play “Posh” by Laura Wade, and directed by Lone Scherfig (“An Education”), “The Riot Club” is like “Project X” crossed with an English historical drama, hinting faintly at the bigotry of the one percent while providing visual thrills sure to satiate the modern, maybe attention-lacking, viewer.
The film jumps forward to modern times, where the long-lived club is attempting to recruit some new, first year chaps into their cliquey circle. Miles (Max Irons, son of Jeremy Irons) is a bookish good-boy, our everyman, who almost immediately clashes with Alistair (Sam Claflin) as they argue about politics and economy. Yes, the film is filled with this mix of intelligent talk one moment, smashing liquor bottles and getting into brawls the next.
A ceremonial hazing begins, where we meet the womanizing Harry (Douglas Booth) and other equally quirky characters. The issue of class is examined as Lauren (Holliday Grainger) begins a relationship with Miles, and we glean at the divide between the entitled upper crust and their apparent underlings in society. Much of the film gives the appearance of a world building exercise, leading up to a climactic supper scene towards the end, where the club meets at a rural pub for a lavish meal and personalities diverge. The bubble that is formed by the ten men in the club begins to burst into a fit of violence, and the audience may be delighted to see these egoists unravel a bit.
This is an ensemble film, as each character as a group is given attention. The titular club itself is the driving force of the story – just another chapter of their history. It is in their mistakes as people that we learn that an academic perspective cannot be easily applied to the problems of life itself. Books can’t always match the teaching in overcoming a difficult experience, and our Riot Club boys are not as smart as they think they are.
While “The Riot Club” has its share of interestingly dark melo-drama, its portrayal of posh-society-gone-wild is ultimately unremarkable and overcooked. The film seems on the verge of fulfilling its root in social satire, yet lacking a clear route to being insightful in that way – there is a sense of incompletion. This is not helped by a lack of subtlety, especially in the emphasis on the arrogant elitism of its characters.
“The Riot Club” is released theatrically and on video-on-demand March 27 by IFC Films. It first premiered at the 2014 Toronto Film Festival.

On Friday, March 20, the baseball team defeated the Mavericks from Mercy College in the first of a trio of games over the weekend from Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Despite a forecast that called for some snow, the Pioneers were able to come out on top in their East Coast Conference opener, winning by a score of 3-1.
Sophomore pitcher Jake DeCarli tossed a gem, allowing one unearned run over 7.2 innings and striking out eight hitters. Fellow sophomore pitcher Dan Jagiello pitched the remaining 1.1 innings to notch his first save on the young season. The Pioneers scored two of three runs on wild pitches by the Mavericks. The lone RBI for the Green and Gold came from sophomore outfielder Kenny Daley who cracked a single in the first inning.
After heavy snowfall on Saturday, March 21, the Pioneers and Mavericks were forced to reschedule their set of games. Both sides returned to the diamond on Sunday, March 22, in a doubleheader, which rounded out the slew of games for the Pioneers. The Mavericks, looking to respond after Friday’s performance, did so in game one with a convincing 13-1 victory.
The Mavericks were put in a great position to win because of starting pitcher Matt Nalbone, who notched his first win of the year The sophomore allowed a measly six hits and one run over eight innings while fanning 13. The bats for Mercy didn’t get going until the sixth inning, but at that time they exploded for eight runs. They totaled 19 hits compared to the six for LIU Post.
In the finale of the three-game set, the Pioneers were able to pull out a 5-4 win. The Green and Gold were powered by a three run outburst in the first inning and a huge home run late in the game by junior first baseman David Groeneveld.
After the Mavericks grabbed a quick 1-0 lead early, the Pioneers responded with three runs of their own. RBI singles by Groeneveld and sophomore catcher Thomas Asbaty accounted for two of the three runs. The LIU three-run inning was answered with a Mercy three-run inning in the second and the Pioneers found themselves down by a run.
After a sacrifice fly by Asbaty in the third inning, which tied the game at four, the pitchers for both clubs decided to turn it up a notch. The Mavericks were held scoreless for the rest of the afternoon while the Pioneers grabbed the lead in the sixth on a homer by Groeneveld. On the hill, junior pitcher Dillon Burke earned his second win, tossing two scoreless innings and striking out one.
Head Coach Mike Gaffney and his squad return to action on Friday, March 27, when they hit the road to play the Lions from Molloy College in the first of a three-game set. First pitch is set for 3:30 p.m.

On Thursday, March 19, the eighth-ranked Pioneers commenced a three-game home stand as they beat up on Philadelphia University 20- 11, in non-conference action at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
Sophomore midfielder Connor Bird had a field day as she scored a career-high eight points. In addition, Bird also won seven draw controls in the victory. Red-shirt sophomore Emily Delaney racked up six points, five ground balls, and three caused turnovers. Senior midfielder Jenna Pierro and sophomore attacker Stefani Vagelatos each tallied four points apiece.
The Pioneers netted seven unanswered goals after trailing 2-0 and never looked back. LIU Post outshot the Rams by a count of 36-25. The hosts totaled 23 ground balls and 20 draw controls compared to Philadelphia’s 17 ground balls and 13 face-offs. To add to the stat-line, the Green and Gold also converted 15-of-19 clears and 8-of-12 free- position attempts.
The Pioneers returned on Saturday, March 21, where they won a low-scoring defensive battle against Roberts Wesleyan College, 6-4, in an East Coast Conference tilt.
Following a late second half rally, the squad held on as the Redhawks’ comeback effort fell short after falling into a 5-0 hole. Pierro put the game to bed as she scored her third goal of the contest, giving the hosts a 6-3 edge with under nine minutes remaining.
Vagelatos and Pierro both found the back of the net twice in the opening stanza as the hosts took a 4-0 lead into halftime. The Pioneers controlled the tempo for the entire period and limited scoring opportunities for the visitors.
Once Delaney scored to put the Pioneers up 5-0 at the 26:07 mark of the second half, the Redhawks put all hands on deck and started attacking the net. Sophomore attacker Cassley Jackowski scored three consecutive goals in an eight-minute span to cut the deficit to 5-3. However, the visitors’ glimpse of hope was quickly adjourned when the Pioneers milked the clock and tacked on another score.
LIU Post goaltender Olivia Kirk made two saves in the cage, but only faced six shots on goal the entire game. The Green and Gold held the advantage in every single category, recording 24 shots, 26 caused turnovers, 23 ground balls, and nine draw controls.
Head Coach Meghan McNamara and the Pioneers will close out their three-game home stand when they take the field today against East Coast Conference foe, Saint Anselm College. Opening draw is scheduled for 3 p.m.

In a double dip against the Southern Connecticut State Owls on Thursday, March 19, the softball team earned a split at the Softball Complex in Brookville, N.Y.
In the first game, the Pioneers grabbed the early lead when sophomore outfielder Mackenzie Buckley singled through the right side to score sophomore infielder Kayla McCoy. Later on in the third inning, the Pioneers doubled their lead when sophomore infielder Melissa Peet launched a solo shot over the right field fence, making it a 2-0 game.
The Owls answered back though in the fourth inning with a home run of their own to even up the game at two apiece. The score stood pat through regulation and eventually extra frames were needed to decide a winner. The Owls went on to secure a 4-2 victory thanks to another two- run home run in the top of the eighth inning. Sophomore pitcher Ashley Martin commanded the circle through eight innings for the Pioneers and struck out eight while allowing just one walk.
The second game was different for the Pioneers as their bats came alive and they pounded the Owls for 10 runs en route to a 10-0 victory. The Green and Gold manufactured four runs right off the bat in the first inning. In the third, Peet continued her spectacular day when she sent another ball over the wall to increase the lead to 5-0.
The back breaker for the Owls came in the sixth inning when the Pioneers tallied five more runs and the exclamation point was a three- run blast off the bat of junior infielder Maria Palmeri.
Perhaps even more impressive than the hitting in the second game was the pitching from Megan Salcido. The senior improved to 2-2 on the year and tossed six frames of no-hit ball. She struck out five batters and only allowed one base on balls.
Due to inclement weather conditions, the Pioneers’ doubleheader against the Bears from NYIT set for Saturday, March 21, was postponed and rescheduled. Head Coach Jamie Apicella and the Pioneers return to the field today against Mercy College. First pitch from the LIU Post Softball Complex is set for 2 p.m.

The men’s lacrosse team saw itself slide down three steps to fifth seed on the USILA and Lacrosse Magazine Division II Top-15 rankings last Monday, after a hard-fought battle at Adelphi University.
But the Pioneers recovered sturdily to the results of a seemingly unimportant poll thus far in the season; junior attackman Ryan Slane’s goal scoring led the Pioneers en route to two victories to finish off their three-game home stand in the East Coast Conference.
Slane went on a six-goal roll in the match-up against the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds that lead the hosts to a comfortable 13-5 win. Fellow junior attackman Matty Beccaris also recorded six points, four of which were assists.
Despite a 1-1 mark long into the first stanza, the Firebirds didn’t have much to say this afternoon. Once LIU Post notched three tallies with only minutes to go before the break, the guests were unable to respond.
The Green Machine totaled 45 shots over the four quarters while the Firebirds fired off 23. Neat and orderly, the Pioneers brushed off most of the ashes from offensive Firebird attacks as the defense stood for 15-of-18 clears.
LIU Post returned to the castle on Saturday, March 21, against Chestnut Hill, eager to continue their perfect ECC record. The hosts started off wildly up front by scoring six unanswered goals to welcome their opponents to Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium, which seemed to have recovered from the surprising late-March snow.
Up 6-1 after the first quarter, the home side had no intentions to stop attacking. The Pioneers stood for another six-goal commotion with two man-up tallies from junior midfielder Anthony Berardis.
The guests attempted to come back, but never really came close. Despite 33 shots for the Griffins, only six found the cage behind junior goalkeeper Adam Winne, who stood for 11 consecutive saves.
Senior attackman Chris Caiazza scored a career-high seven points, with six tallies and one feed while Berardis tied his career-best with four points as well. As the final whistle blew, the scoreboard shone 18 bright for the hosts and only six for the guests.
Head Coach John Jez and his squad are going on the road next as they face Post University today in a non-Conference tilt. Faceoff is scheduled for 3 p.m.
