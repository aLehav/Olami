As The Pioneer reported on Sept. 30, the LIU Post equestrian team set out to complete a daunting mission—raise enough money to rescue a slaughter- bound miniature horse, and make him the team mascot. The team held a bake sale during common hour in Hillwood Commons, posted flyers throughout campus seeking donations, and even created a web page on gofundme.com so that others could donate money to pay for the purchase and future expenses of the miniature horse.
After a lot of hard work and dedication, the girls were finally financially able to travel to the horse auction located in New Holland, Pennsylvania and choose which lucky horse would be coming home with them for another chance at life as their team mascot.
The mission took place on Oct. 13. Hope, a sweet palomino mare, caught the riders’ attention right away. Two of the three team captains, Cristina Bakos, a senior Speech Pathology/Pre-Med major, and Alex Diez, a junior Biology major, as well as one of the fundraisers, Christina Cepeda, a junior Psychology major, brought the mini horse to her new home in Bakos’ backyard barn in Nesconset, where she will have a much more exciting life with the other mini horses—and a donkey—already living there.
All of the money raised by the team will be put towards the many expenses needed to properly care for any horse, including veterinary and farrier appointments (hoof trimming), board, feed, wormer, shavings, and clothing. Hope had a warm welcome to the LIU Post equestrian team when she made her mascot debut at the annual Homecoming Football Game on Saturday, Oct. 18. For such a tiny equine, Hope handled the loud, crazy football game quite well. She tried her best to not get too overwhelmed.
“She was calm at homecoming, but would sometimes get startled with sudden, loud noises like popping balloons or the loud music, but eventually she got accustomed to the all the noise,” said team member Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major and the team’s Treasurer.
The day at homecoming was a success, which even included raising more money to care for Hope in the future. The equestrian team raised $1,110 through their “Go Fund Me” account, which is linked on the team’s Facebook page. To donate money to help Hope, you can go to www.gofundme.com/save- a-pony, or email christina.kotarski@my.liu.edu or christina.cepeda@my.liu.edu.
The next on-campus horse show at the North Shore Equestrian Center will be on Nov. 9, at 8 a.m. Hope, the mini mascot, will be there to show support. The event is open to the public.

A new, three-credit elec- tive course will be offered during the summer of 2015, giving Post students a combination of theoreti- cal classroom sessions and practi- cal field excursions while traveling through the savanna ecosystem of northern Tanzania. The two-week trip, running from May 31 through June 14, will be open to undergrad- uate and graduate students from all LIU campuses.
The course instructor, Dr. Mark Pires, is a professor of Geography and former academic director of the School for International Training in Cameroon. Pires has previously offered study abroad programs, including summer travel courses for LIU to Kenya and Senegal. “My first experience ever in Africa took place when I was an exchange student [in] Kenya during my undergraduate years,” Pires said. “That experience led to what became a lifelong interest and commitment to learning and teaching about this part of the world.”
Students will analyze the complexity of the region caused by an overwhelming nature- related tourism, and the different stakeholders’ interest in its beauty. “This new success poses some big challenges to making sure that the boom in tourism is ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable for the long term,” Pires said.
During the time abroad, students will visit a Maasai community development project, take a four-day field trip at the Lake Manyara National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, and hike at the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro.
Pires is aware that two weeks is a short period of time to grasp the complexity of Tanzania, but he is hoping that students will bring back more in their educational portfolios than prior to leaving. “I hope to help students recognize, and chip away at some of the persistent myths and stereotypes many people tend to hold about Africa,” he said. He explained that former students’ lack of knowledge in geography would sometimes make him laugh. “I often joke with students in my introductory geography courses that if they learn nothing else from me all semester, they must walk away knowing that Africa is a continent and not a country!” Pires added.
“I am culturally an extremely open person, and believe [that] traveling [is] the most important school,” said Carolin Rademacher, a senior Psychology and Business major. “I would most definitely want to be part of that experience.”
Rademacher described her recent solo trip to Indonesia as eye opening, and would want more students to experience what she did, drawing some similarities to the study abroad trip. “Tanzania would give students the opportunity to broaden their horizons and get a better understanding of the world, as well as giving them the chance to see the influence each individual has on this planet.”
Some students may feel worried about the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa, but Pires reassured them that health comes first always. “Whether on campus or on a study abroad program, concern for student health and safety is of primary importance,” Pires said. He also stated that the Ebola virus will continue to be monitored before May 31.
Rademacher, though, was undeterred. “I wouldn’t be scared of Ebola,” she said. “Of course it is nothing to joke about, but it has been around for a very long time,” she continued. Rademacher blamed the mass media for playing an essential role in the hype of the virus.
Sophomore Health Science major Holly Azueta, aware of the current safety reports, stated, “At the moment, I would not be afraid of traveling to Tanzania because there are no reported cases of Ebola there.”
Pires stated that the trip would be subject to reconsideration if there are any new outbreaks that would jeopardize the health and safety of students participating in the course. Regardless, Pires warned of the moderately strenuous activities, such as hiking, that the trip entails. Good personal fitness is significant for students participating.
The estimated cost for the two-week program is $6,090 for undergraduate students, and $6,396 for graduate students. It includes LIU tuition ($3,090/$3,396); a course travel fee of $1,500 to cover in-country meals, lodging, transportation, and program activities; and airfare (estimated $1,500) from New York, according to Pires. For more information on how to register, contact Mark Pires at Mark.Pires@liu. edu.
*The cost for airfare is subject to change based on the fare applicable at time of booking. The above program costs do not include: recommended vaccinations, Tanzania tourist visa ($100), student health insurance fee, travel to and from New York airport, optional airfare cancellation, or personal spending money in Tanzania.

When Dr. Craig Spencer, a physician who traveled to Guinea to help those diagnosed with Ebola, tested positive for the same disease on Thursday, Oct. 23, New York had their first official case of Ebola, and LIU Post responded.
“Long Island University remains dedicated to the health and wellness of our campus communities, as we are proactive in our efforts to protect students, faculty, staff, and guests from infectious diseases and other serious health threats,” a mass LIU information email explained, informing the campus of the Ebola threat in New York City. “LIU continues to monitor the Ebola situation as it develops, and while the likelihood of a campus outbreak is extremely small, we are taking measures to ensure that our current health policies continue to be highly effective and communicated in an efficient, precise manner.”
According to the same mass message, which was sent out on Oct. 24, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a level three warning on travel advisories, and recommend that people avoid non-essential travel to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone at this time, and “that education-related travel to these countries be postponed until further notice due to the ongoing outbreak of the Ebola virus.”
Dr. Spencer’s timeline after arriving at Kennedy International airport on Oct. 17 has been met with heavy criticism, mostly through social media. However, in remarks said on Oct. 24, even New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo feels that Dr. Spencer should have behaved as if under quarantine. According to an Oct. 25, New York Times article on page A17 of the New York edition, Spencer rode multiple subway trains and attended a bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Lastly, the mass LIU email reassured the recipients that if you have not traveled to one of these countries in the past 21 days, or have not been in contact with someone diagnosed with Ebola, it is unlikely that you have the disease. According to cdc.gov, since March 2014, there are 5,481 laboratory reported cases of the virus.

“You’re Somebody’s Type!” read a flyer around campus promoting the LIU Post Blood Drive, which took place on Tuesday, Oct. 21, and Wednesday, Oct. 22. The blood drive was held by the New York Blood Center, which is one of the largest community-based, non-profit blood collection and distribution organizations in the U.S. Donation centers were set up in The End Zone on the first floor of Hillwood Commons, and were open from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
According to Michele McCaffrey, an Account Manager for Long Island Blood Services, 185 donors, all LIU Post students and staff, took advantage of the opportunity to help those in need of blood. McCaffrey said that was equal to 218 units of blood.
“On the first day, we had over 100 pints donated. As of 3 p.m. on Wednesday, an additional 70 pints were collected,” said Rita Langdon, the Executive Director of Campus Operations and Strategic Partnerships, who was involved with organizing the event. However, she wasn’t alone. “Campus Life collaborated with LIU’s Communications and Marketing Department, along with the New York Blood Center, to host the event,” she said.
LIU Post has hosted blood drives on campus for over 20 years. “We encourage students to participate. If you cannot donate blood, you can help recruit others or volunteer to work the event,” Langdon added.
Homecoming King Romar Lyle was a first-time blood donor this year. “What I loved about it was how friendly the staff was. They were also very good with confidentiality and taking care of those who donated after they finished.” The senior Psychology and Criminal Justice major was a bit squeamish after a bad prior experience. “I had a situation when I was doing a blood test, and the doctor messed up so many times. Since then, I never liked the idea of giving blood,” he said.
Yet, Lyle now claims that he wants to do it again. “I got over the fear of donating and after I got over it, I wanted to donate again. When I found out I could only donate every 56 days, I grabbed some people and convinced them to donate.”
According to the American Red Cross, every two seconds someone in the United States needs blood. This past week, LIU Post helped many in need. “This blood drive has been a huge success thanks to the LIU Post students, faculty, alumni, and staff who joined together to support this important cause. We are grateful to the campus community who contributed to saving lives through the gift of blood donations,” Langdon said.
The next LIU Post blood drive will take place on Dec. 3, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in The End Zone.

On Thursday, Oct. 30, Halloween will come early to campus as WCWP, the campus radio station, will be hosting a Halloween party on the rooftop of Hillwood Commons. The party takes place during common hour, and is open to all students. WCWP is located behind Hillwood Commons.
The Halloween party is an annual tradition, according to Assistant Station Manager and alumni, Christina Kay. “The Halloween party has been going on probably since the beginning of time,” said Kay. The party will feature a DJ and free food. Students are urged to dress up, as there will likely be a costume related giveaway.
This will be WCWP’s second party of the semester, but this time the party will also mark the end of a weeklong scavenger hunt. The scavenger hunt was cooked up Kay and several other members of WCWP’s Sports department. This is another attempt by the station to get students involved. The participants who signed up will find different items across campus and post them on social media as part of the contest. The winners will receive a $100 dollar gift card for each group member. “I wish there was something like this when I was a student,” Kay added.
As a former student, Kay feels that these events do much more than promote the station by providing an opportunity to socialize at school. “We are here for the campus, whether it be online or on the radio.” Kay also feels that the events WCWP hosts are great opportunities for students who are unaware of the station.
Chris Maffei, Production Director and alumni, feels that these parties offer a taste of the station’s atmosphere. Maffei believes WCWP has parties to create a very social and lively environment. “[It’s] a home away from home,” Maffei said when describing the station.
Deandre Wilson, a junior Broadcasting major, agrees. Wilson, who is the co-host of the sports show “In The Clutch,” transferred to LIU Post last year and has attended every WCWP party since then. Wilson believes these parties are a unique way to promote the station. “I think it’s different, it’s a good way to put everyone together, and at the same time a lot of people can get involved,” he said.
Members of PTV, the campus television station, will be in attendance filming the event. For all of WCWP’s events, Maffei produces a highlight reel, which can be watched on WCWP’s YouTube channel. In the past, WCWP has had rap battles, dance offs, and a Michael Jackson impersonation at its events.
WCWP has several more events planned for this academic year. There are tentative dates in The End Zone, Winnick, and hopefully a Christmas-themed party, according to Kay.

The Psychology Department in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is now offering a 36-credit Masters of Arts degree in Behavior Analysis, beginning in the 2014-2015 academic year. “Behavior Analysis is a technique within Psychology for designing interventions for various types of behavioral changes,” said Nancy Frye, Psychology professor and graduate director of the Psychology department. “For instance, Behavior Analysis is the preferred technique for helping children with autism. Behavior Analysis can be used to help foster children›s social behaviors, and to also help minimize problematic behaviors. Because of this, there are likely to be numerous job opportunities within the field of Behavior Analysis.”
“We have been trying to expand Behavior Analysis so that it deals with a lot of things other than autism. The idea is to try to broaden the field so that it [does] not only deal with people with developmental disabilities,” said Gerald Lachter, Psychology professor and Chairperson of the Psychology department, who is also a licensed behavior analyst in New York.
The addition of a master’s degree in Behavioral Analysis was a natural extension of an already existing certificate program in Behavioral Analysis in the Psychology Department, according to Lachter. “For about 12 years, we have had an advanced certificate program, which is an 18-credit program to train individuals to do applied Behavior Analysis. The courses that make up the certificate program also carry over into the master’s program,” Lachter added. The Behavior Analysis M.A. requires 18 credits beyond those required for the advanced certificate. Additional courses, such as Behavioral Assessment and Advanced Issues in Applied Behavior, have been added to the curriculum.
This past summer, New York passed a law that allows people to obtain licenses in Behavior Analysis, which will likely increase the job opportunities. “Behavior Analysis can be used to help foster children’s social behaviors, and also to help minimize problematic behaviors,” Frye said. “Because of this, there are likely to be numerous job opportunities within the field of Behavior Analysis.”
“If you complete this program and you pass a national certification exam, you can then become licensed as a behavior analyst in New York, which means that you can do in-home work, you can work with agencies, you can do private practice work, just to name a few,” Lachter said. “In order to take the certification exam, students need to obtain supervised, clinical experience in Behavior Analysis.”
Many students obtain supervised, clinical experience in settings where individuals are developmentally disabled – more specifically, with autistic children. “There are a lot of agencies on Long Island and in New York State,” Lachter continued. “There are usually no difficulties in finding appropriate placement for students.”
Acquiring the proper training and experience on the graduate level will allow you to serve a population of people that truly need it. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are on the rise, affecting children in unprecedented numbers, according to New York State’s Office for Developmental Disabilities. However, there aren’t enough people who are trained to provide the services that are of crucial importance to their development.
“The goal [of implementing this M.A. program] is to provide the kind of training that people need to serve the population of children who are on the autism spectrum. We want to train as many individuals that we can that are qualified because there really aren’t enough well trained people in the field.
There are only a small number of behavior analysts in New York State, probably between 400 and 500. Yet, there are 17,000 children who are on the autism spectrum,” Lachter said.
The Psychology Department plans to implement other new programs in the future, according to Frye. “The Psychology department is working on some five year degree plans, through which students could earn a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in five years,” she said. “We are currently working on five year programs that could lead to a Master’s in Behavior Analysis, and we are working with Mental Health Counseling on a five year program that would lead to a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and a Master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling.”
“I’m happy to see the Psychology department is expanding,” said Catherine Bihun, a junior Psychology major. “The Psychology professors at Post know their stuff, so I think they can do a lot with the program. However, I hope that the Psychology department implements more interning and volunteer opportunities on the undergraduate level, as well.”
To learn more about an M.A. in Behavior Analysis, contact Nancy Frye, the graduate director of the Psychology department, or Gerald Lachter, the chairperson of the Psychology department at (516) 299- 2184.

For most students, their first time being in a college setting is generally their first time living away from home. With all that freedom, you also begin to feel a sense of loneliness, leaving all your friends and family behind. Being a part of a club fills the void of feeling as though you do not belong.
Thankfully, Post provides a variety of clubs and organizations to be a part of to evoke a sense of belonging and family. These various clubs on campus cater to students with all interests. They allow groups of students with common interests to get together and discuss or even act on common concerns. It also invites students who are unaware of different cultures to learn more about other ideas and customs. Post does a great job of accommodating students and keeping them intrigued.
“Clubs are diverse on campus and there is a great variety to choose from,” Juanita Ramirez, a senior Psychology major and a member of Student Caribbean Association (SCA), said. There are clubs for dormers or commuters, dancers and athletes, and for those who want to learn about different cultures—the list goes on. The best part about these clubs is that you can have no experience in them and can still partake.
“There’s always something to do!” Moca Johnson, a sophomore Business Management major and Student Dance Association (SDA) member, said. If you are bored on campus, that is your own fault. Clubs keep you busy with programs and events held on campus. These meetings, programs, and events are generally held during the week: during common hour or after school.
Though Post provides students with a number of options to choose from, many students are still dissatisfied. “Certain clubs host events and programs that only residents can get to, leaving out commuters,” Amadu Barrie, a junior Computer Science major and member of SDA, The Runway, Twice as Nice, Do Something, Delta X and P.A.G.E.S., said. “The problem is not the lack of variety of clubs on campus, it is the lack of involvement from the student body.” Barrie continued, “The way to fix this problem is to get involved more as a school community.”
Jessy Pierre, a junior Psychology major and a member of Twice as Nice, SDA, The Runway, Do Something, and Black Students United (BSU) said, “Clubs on campus are more resident-based, having programs at inconvenient times and locations. This results in low attendance. The Student Government Association (SGA) should start surveying students on the clubs they would like to see on campus.”
I agree with my peers, that the problem is not a lack of variety of clubs on campus; it is the lack of interest from the student body to get involved. There should be more promotion and advertising of the clubs on campus. More importantly, the members of these clubs should attract other students with fun and exciting events and programs they can attend. For a better response from the school community, clubs should host more events during common hour, when practically the entire student body is here. The clubs can definitely count on better turnout and students will be exposed to the variety of clubs on campus.

Usually, at the end of senior year in high school, many students will take a road trip with their friends to explore the great unknown before heading off on different paths to college. Yes, this is an invigorating experience, but what if you can get the same experience—if not one more intense and diversified—in college?
“End-of-high-school-road-trips” are not the end of adventure in our student lives. Universities these days are offering more study abroad opportunities to the students than ever before. LIU is one of those universities that have broadened their international spectrum. We are lucky to have LIU Global and regular studying abroad.
What is LIU Global? LIU is the only college in the world with a fulltime immersion in numerous countries around the world with classroom and field study, internships, and community service. Sounds great, doesn’t it? Well, the catch is, to be part of LIU Global you have to be in the Bachelor of Arts in Global Studies program. If you are part of this unique program, you live eight semesters abroad in eight or more diverse countries. It’s an amazing opportunity to learn about cultures, experience new and unique adventures, and be educated in a degree about Global Studies. The program is somewhat limiting, however, since there are only afew countries you can travel to, making it difficult to create a customized study abroad experience. If you are interested in this program, all this information, and more, can be found under the LIU Global tab on LIU’s website.
Whereas LIU Global pertains to a specific program and limited options of countries to live in, general study abroad is the best option for all other students. LIU has recently expanded its study abroad opportunities to include London, Turkey, Thailand, India, Japan, China, Costa Rica, Australia, and Taiwan. The school offers over a dozen affiliated study abroad programs during all times of the year in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. Some current programs include tropical reef dynamics in Fiji, dolphin social behavior in Costa Rica, and tropical marine biology in Jamaica. And, if you don’t like LIU’s affiliated programs, you can also apply to non-affiliated programs through Academic Programs International, AIFSA, Arcadia University, CIEE, and GlobaLinks. All you have to do is schedule a meeting with Patricia Murdock, Director of Study Abroad, at patricia.murdock@liu. edu to start creating your study abroad experience.
It is easier now, more than ever, to pack a suitcase and spend a semester (or summer session) in England, Africa, Asia—you name it. Whether it’s eating a baguette in a local Parisian café, watching a bull fight in a Spanish village, or trekking the Great Wall of China, studying abroad helps us grow as individuals and members of our society. It is a good thing that study abroad opportunities at LIU are growing by the day, because, in my opinion, it is a vital component of our education.
Studying abroad diversifies our understanding of ourselves in culture. Not only are you fully immersed in a foreign landscape, but you are also educated in classroom and community settings. Every study abroad experience is completely different, and one you will not regret. Your end-of-high-school-road-trip is just the beginning of bigger and better adventures throughout college and beyond.

Summer has come and gone. The leaves have changed colors and the temperature has dropped over the last few weeks. Before we know it, we will be exchanging our sweaters and scarves for warm jackets and snow boots.
Winter is a difficult time to be a college student for a few reasons, such as how inclement weather can cause snow days. Snow days can be fun and enjoyable once in a while, but too many can put a damper on the flow of the semester. Black ice and snow on the roads also make the trip for the commuters an even more gruesome one. Those who dorm on campus don’t have it all that easy, either; students still must hike in the bitter temperature from the Residence Halls to either Hillwood Commons or Winnick to eat, and Humanities Hall or Pell Hall for class.
I believe that LIU Post is totally prepared for the upcoming winter. Not only does our campus staff have many years of experience dealing with harsh Long Island winters, the Facilities department has salt and plow trucks standing by ready for action.
“All snow plowing is performed by LIU employees,” Head of Facilities William Kirker said. “Our grounds and custodial personnel clear the roads, paths and stairs along with applying salt.”
Kirker continued, “We are already in the process of getting ready for these conditions by preparing vehicles and other equipment for plowing and salting. We also need to monitor fuel levels, salt levels and spare parts that may be needed during times of emergencies. Contracts with vendors need to be set up well in advance.”
Generators for power are in some of the campus buildings, such as Humanities Hall. “We have generators in many buildings. The south end of campus does not have generators. However, generators’ primary purpose is for emergency lighting for people to safely exit a building in time of an emergency,” Kirker said. “In many buildings we also use them for providing power to heating systems to be able to keep buildings from freezing in the winter time in the event of a prolonged power outage. All our generators are tested regularly and then tested annually by the Nassau County Fire Marshal›s office,” Kirker added.
Communication about cancelled classes, early dismissals, and the like are able to be broadcasted on news stations throughout the Long Island area. Another great way of contacting students that many colleges, including LIU Post, use is by texting our cell phones pertinent notifications as they arise. WCWP, the campus radio station, is also great for staying in the know for any adjustments in class schedules or closings.
While the Facilities department is getting the campus prepared for winter, we students should be doing our part to prepare. We should be getting out our warmer winter clothing and snow gear and paying attention to the weather forecasts, either by computer or cell phones. Since most students either drive to campus or keep their cars on campus, caring for your vehicle is another factor of winter at Post. Students should check the overall soundness of their cars, make sure it has anti- freeze, and has good tires for traction on those snowy days. A handy tool to have in the trunk of your car is an ice scraper for the windshields.
For campus-wide school closings, a vital number to have in your phone contacts is 516-299-EMER(3637). Students can also check the LIU Post website or report to www.weatherclosings.com. News 12 Long Island, CBS Channel 2, and NBC Channel 4 are the TV stations that will announce late openings or early dismissals. If you have any suggestions on how students or the staff can better prepare for this upcoming winter, let us know at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

For some students, to dorm on campus provides a sense of independence or freedom. You are on your own, living in your own space with no one really to answer to. You may come and go as you please, have company, and do whatever it is you may want to do while you are not in your parents’ household. Though you are technically living on your own, there are campus housing rules you do have to follow. These rules are meant to provide a fair and safe environment for students.
Among the dorm rules, “Quiet Hours” seem to be the most disputed among students. Quiet Hours is simply a time of day, typically at night, that residence halls are required to be quiet. Throughout the day, there may be music playing or loud talking, which is acceptable, but Quiet Hours, ensures a peaceful and silent environment.
As a Campus Life Coordinator of Nassau and Suffolk Hall, Arianna Livreri knows firsthand about the impact of Quiet Hours in residence halls. “Quiet Hours start at 9 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday and 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday,” she explained. The Quiet Hours policy is intended to limit the amount of noise in the dorms during the week, but allots more time for noise during the weekend.
“Quiet Hours are needed. It helps me concentrate while studying,” Khadijah Swann, a junior Photography major who lives in Nassau Hall said. This is in fact one of the reasons for Quiet Hours in the residence halls: to ensure silent and equipped study environments. “I’m able to sleep at night, so that I’m better prepared for class the next day,” Swann added.
There are cases, however, when students ignore Quiet Hours and go on as if these rules do not exist. Those students feel that they are entitled to make as much noise as they want because they pay for school.
“Though they are not effective and used properly, Quiet Hours are essential to the school community,” Romar Lyle, a senior Psychology and Criminal Justice major who is also a Residence Assistance (RA) in Nassau Hall, said. “It’s too bad students do not take advantage of them.”
Lyle continued, “There should be more desk attendants (DAs) provided so that RAs can do their job effectively.” Desk attendants are student workers that watch the front door of the residence halls, assist in signing in visitors from other residence halls, commuter students or outside guest, and monitor the traffic of the door. There are a different number of desk attendants assigned to each residence hall.
“I deem Quiet Hours to be beneficial for the students so that they have time to work on homework and other projects that may require a quiet environment,” Livreri said. “It also is beneficial to those who like to go to bed early.”
Livreri continued, “I feel that some students do take advantage of Quiet Hour. Especially those who have early practices and those very involved in their studies. RAs are able to monitor each building and if noise ever becomes an issue it is addressed immediately.” Traditionally, too noisy students are forewarned to bring the noise down. If the students do not take precaution, they are eventually written up for noise disturbance.
I feel that Quiet Hours are essential and beneficial for students in residence halls. It ensures the peace and quiet that is needed for students to focus and concentrate on school work. You feel secure in knowing that you will get a good night’s rest for that 8 a.m. class the next day.

When we international students made that huge leap of faith into the unknown, most of us had a plan. “The Plan” is something your parents have nagged you about for ages, and something our generation and the ones before us have all felt pressured to make and stick to. I want to know whether you guys, and myself, have stuck to these regimented layouts or whether some of us have veered off down a new path; maybe one that we didn’t see ourselves strolling down? What were our initial thoughts and ideas of what was entailed for us or what we were destined for? And what are you guys up to now? Has it changed? These are the questions I wanted to answer this week.
“Eivind, could you take me through some of the things that have changed since you have been here at post?”
“Yeah, my teammates have got younger!”
This is a reply from Eivind Austboe, a senior Business Management student and captain of the Post’s men’s soccer team. I would note down all of his other accolades, but there isn’t enough room! Eivind is from Stavanger, Norway, and this is his fourth and final year in the “Green Army” of LIU Post.
When I spoke to him about whether his “plan” had changed since making the audacious move over to the U.S., he replied, “I actually stuck with my original plan of studying Business Management. You may want to ask someone who had a more interesting route to their degree.” But this is the thing: in my eyes, I find this incredible and fascinating how he has had the capability, patience, and strength to be able to withstand the pressure and the hard times, while continuing on the same line he set out to walk across.
Being Eivind’s teammate, I have witnessed his great drive and determination in everything he does. In this aspect of life he is like a role model to me, in terms of how he has everything planned out and knows what he has to do to reach the goals he sets himself. I imagine there are many students like Eivind that have the great discipline and determination to not veer off into other paths, or even choose easier subjects to take.
If I compare myself to international students like these, I have mixed feelings. “Am I the same? Do I know what my path is?” Yes, I knew what major I wanted to do, which is Psychology, and I have been interested in this ever since I could remember. But, is this what I really I have so many questions and queries on what I want to do now, compared to what I thought I wanted to do before I came to the “land of opportunities.”
Soccer is my immediate and most important career path. It has been since I was a little munchkin who couldn’t be seen doing anything else apart from having a soccer ball at my feet. But will this dream of mine stay? Will it be the most important thing, now that I have moved to a different place that offers so many different and diverse opportunities? Well, I guess I can rule out one subject that won’t be catching my eyes with appealing job opportunities: Math!
Another international student, Alex Billington, majoring in International Studies and known as “The Stud” of the Post men’s soccer team, as well as our own publisher of the “Bottom Line” (which you should definitely pick up next time it’s out!) has an extremely different story to that of Eivind Austboe.
“My political views and ideals have definitely changed and developed since I’ve been here, partly because of my exposure to so many different nationalities all from different systems. One big thing that is constantly changing the more I learn is what might be the path in life that will make me the happiest. But the single biggest thing that has changed is my wealth of opportunity. I used have this immediate dream to become a professional soccer player, but now, however, I have an abundance of things I can chose from and pursue. This is becoming the hardest choice, what is going to optimize my happiness…in every sense of the word.”
I can relate to and find lavish amounts of similarities with Alex because of some of the feelings I have had recently. The words Alex says above are ones I am, too, familiar with. Soccer was—and still is— my main focus and career path, but I can feel my “path” evolving and changing for the better, widening my horizons to all the different and crazy ideas here at college.
Captain Eivind Austboe of the LIU Post men’s soccer team
– Harry Pearse
Ever since this adventure into the wild, I have had this weird and almost overwhelming feeling— is it this abundance of opportunities I am being smacked in the face with, or am I scared to grab hold of something new? So, what I have been doing and I want you guys to take from this column, is to “go with the flow.” Allow things to change and venture into the unknown. We have all made that leap of faith into the abyss anyway, so we may as well “grow a pair’”and come out of our comfort zone. However, if you feel more similarities to Eivind’s story, carry on and don’t let anything budge, push or dislodge you off your path. It’s your path and your dream; just make sure you make it yours!

Smoking is a habit about 42 million Americans have picked up, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention. The American Lung Association declares that “85% of current smokers started when they were 21 years of age or younger.” This statistic demonstrates why it’s not so surprising to see college campuses populated with cigarette smokers.
LIU Post’s smoking policy, which is in compliance with the Nassau County Ordinance, is that “No person shall smoke or carry
a lighted cigar, cigarette, pipe, or any other form of smoking object or device in any building on the campus,” according to the LIU Post Memorandum. The memorandum which states this policy can be found on the LIU Post website under the Public Safety tab. The policy further explains that smoking is not permitted in any residence hall on campus, and there should be no smoking in areas within 15 feet of a residence building. The policy also states, “Those found in violation of this law will be subject to disciplinary action and will be reported to their respective supervisors.” The Nassau County Ordinance, according to NassauCountyNY.gov, states, “smoking inside, in public, or at any workplace, is prohibited,” and LIU follows this ordinance since all buildings on campus are smoke-free.
Anti-Smoking activists often make it publicly clear that they are against smoking and find it not only deadly to those who smoke, but also to those exposed to second-hand smoke. There are often students smoking directly outside residence halls and many of the education buildings. Smoking closely to any of these buildings causes the smoke to flow into the buildings, which can cause discomfort to others.
“I don’t think people should be able to smoke cigarettes on campus because they may not think the smoke is affecting anyone when really it is affecting everyone around them with second hand smoke,” said Dylan Silva, a freshman Business major. “LIU should not allow smoking on campus. Some students may feel like they cannot live with the constant smoking that takes place.”
Recently, the University of Georgia system banned smoking on all of its campuses. A New York Times article, written by Alan Blinder on Sept. 28, 2014, stated that, “At the 31 public colleges and universities that make up the University System of Georgia, smoking will be forbidden. The use of chewing tobacco could lead to a penalty.” The Americans Non Smokers’ Rights Foundation reports that, “there are now at least 1,477 100 percent smoke free campuses in the U.S.,” and of those “975 are 100 percent tobacco-free and 291 prohibit the use of e-cigarettes anywhere on campus.” There are 32 college campuses in New York State that have adopted smoke-free policies. As more universities continue to implement bans, it causes other colleges to question whether or not they should do the same. Even though there are several colleges that have adopted smoke-free policies, there are many more that are functioning without such strict restrictions, like LIU Post.
Each day, an “estimated 2,100 youth and young adults who have been occasional smokers become daily cigarette smokers,” according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Running into people that smoke is inevitable. Many teenagers and young adults find stress relief in smoking cigarettes. Being a college student means you have to balance assignments, exams, tuition costs, and personal schedules, so it is not surprising that Post students find relief in smoking cigarettes. “As long as people do it outside, I don’t have a problem with it, it’s a pretty big campus and if people responsibly dispose of the cigarettes then they aren’t doing any harm,” said Adam Hornbuckle, a freshman Political Science major.
Due to the fact that cigarettes aren’t banned from the Post campus, it is impossible to restrict people from smoking, but students can be encouraged to clean up by tossing all cigarette butts into the specific trash cans provided all around campus.

An exciting time of the year for adults, teenagers, and kids is approaching this Friday, Oct. 31. This particular time of year is known as Halloween. Halloween is a holiday that features trick or treating, costume parties, haunted houses, the carving of Jack-O’-Lanterns, and bonfires. Unlike other holidays, Halloween gives individuals the opportunity to dress up, and be someone else for the day. There will not be a Halloween party here at LIU Post; however, some students still anticipate on celebrating the holiday.

“I’m 20 years old and I still go trick or treating every year” said Janet Gavin, a junior Psychology major. “I have a little brother and sister so they keep the Halloween excitement in me. Being around them takes me back to when I was young and used to dress up every year”.
Trick-or-treating has been a Halloween tradition for approximately 100 years in several different countries. Knocking on doors or ringing doorbells with friends, and waiting impatiently to see what the owner will give you is the best excitement about trick or treating. Some owners give small portions, some give big portions, some may even give money, and others may not have anything at all for you.
Freshman Business major Christopher Miles said that he will be attending a Halloween costume party in Brooklyn this year. “Since I’m older now, the party scene is the only thing that I like to do on Halloween” Miles said. “I enjoy dancing, having fun, and seeing what creative costumes people would come up with”. When asking Miles, what he plans on being for Halloween he replied saying he wasn’t sure yet.
“I’m trying to decide on a scary costume or a more creative one; it’s [maybe] going to be Michael Myers, a basketball player from the 80s with short shorts,” Miles said Parties on Halloween are for all ages, but usually are more popular for teenagers and adults. It’s a way to keep the Halloween experience exciting for people when they grow of age. Not everyone may be into the trick-or-treating aspect forever, or even the haunted houses. However, dancing and having fun with your friends dressed as characters can be exciting as well.
Simone Johnson, a Public Relations junior, is excited about going to the haunted house “Blood Manor” in the city. “I’ve never been to a haunted house before so I’m pretty anxious and nervous at the same time,” she said. “I get scared easily, but my friends are begging me to go so I’m going to give it a try,” Johnson added. There are about 10 haunted houses in the tri-state area, and several on the island. If you are really interested in the horror, thrilling, mystery-side of Halloween, then haunted houses are the place for you.
There are plenty of other activities and ways to enjoy yourself on Halloween. For the people that don’t enjoy going out there are horror movies and theme shows that appear on television the whole week of Halloween. It is not a holiday that everyone enjoys, but it is different from others and gives people a different experience. Halloween can be extremely fun, but can also be very dangerous. So the most important thing is to be safe, be aware of your surroundings, travel well, and have a memorable Halloween.

Famed American journalist Mary Schmich once said “Good art is art that allows you to enter it from a variety of angles and to emerge with a variety of views.” For the month of October, Larry Aarons, a native New Yorker from the Bronx who works with graphite, pastels, and charcoals displayed his artwork, “The Myths Of Man” at the Hutchins Gallery located in the lower level of LIU Post’s B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library. He graduated in 1965 from the School of Visual Arts in NYC. Aarons has been honored with many industry awards and never let his love for art be abandoned.
Like many students, Aarons also entered college for one purpose and graduated with his mind set on another. Aarons spoke enthusiastically about his life and artwork. “I entered art school to become an illustrator and somewhere in the end of my first year, some friends of mine introduced me to advertising,” he said. “I became a creative director and had my own advertising agency.”
Although life was wonderful for Aarons, he returned to what he desired the most and that was art. “Somewhere three or four years ago, I decided that I had enough of the business world and I really reentered my art world. It has been fantastic and wonderful and that’s what’s been going on for me,” Aarons continued.
For Aarons, his audience’s reaction means more to him than his own opinions. “All art speaks to people differently, I feel that in my exploration of the portrait world, I have had great success in capturing the human corollary of a portrait.” “Many of my portraits give you eye contact but not staring at you, they give you an eye contact in the manner of what am I thinking as a portrait. So that the viewer reads into the eyes of the person whose portrait it is and can input their own feelings into it, “ Aarons added.
There is always something different about every artist. Either it’s the style of painting, the technique or the theme that makes their artwork different from others. According to Aarons, each artist—no matter how they are schooled—portray their work they way they want to. He believes in the realism of the person but in making sure that the person’s personality comes through the artwork.
On further explaining about what makes his artwork different, Aarons said, “Each piece has its own personality, no two pieces are identical and no two pieces are treated the same. If you look at a gallery show, some of the things that tends to happen to an artist is that he starts to do something really good and then kind of repeats it with a slight variation and there is a tendency that that can get boring.” “The key aspect of my work is that every work of mine has a defined element of lighting,” Aarons said. “When you see something in light you get the information but when you see something in shadow
it’s really there for the fall. You may not see every aspect of the body but you know it’s there. One of the key things I do that separate me from the other artists is that my art is very graphically designed and the aspect of my art leaves you to finish it yourself with your own imagination.”
Aarons is an inspirational artist. His artwork “Myths of Man” which consists of portrays of human and sculptures from around the world took him less than two years to be completed. Aarons plans on adding more portrays to his collection.
Even after coming so long in life, Aarons knew that art is what matters the most to him and returned to which he had left years ago. “Do not let your dreams be diverted, dreams come at different times and mean different things to people,” he said. “Many people follow pursuits that have been dictated to them by other people who say you should do this and I think you’ll be best at that, I’m not telling those students not to listen but I’m saying listen to your heart, listen to your mind, try and give yourself the ability to be open as the ability opposes to itself. A great teacher is one who gives you the tools to make your own decision not the one who gives you the answers,” Aarons advised.

Jianan Li, an MFA Fine Art student from Shandong, China, and Sofie Hoff, a senior Fine Arts major from Malmö, Sweden, held opening receptions for their solo art exhibitions on Wednesday, October 22. Both artists use nature as major parts of their work. Li’s show was held in the Student Art League Gallery in the Hillwood Commons. The show, named “Existence,” is a collection of photographs, ceramics and sculpting. The show was inspired by peace in nature. “I was in a field of reeds, and it was so peaceful,” the artist said. With her show, she’s aiming to emphasize “the natural you.”
That natural you, she says, is you alone in nature. The sculp- tures are made of driftwood along with ceramic faces covered in a leaf on each forehead. “I found the driftwood in Oyster Bay,” she said, with the sculptures resembling that lonely, natural self. “These natural drift- woods, symbolizes the past time. After years of exposure to weather and rain, driftwoods become more tenacious, tougher and smoother. Human life seems like the microcosm of the driftwood” the artist writes in her statement. “Putting masks on the wood and leaving every mask with a leaf, is my way of express the pureness and stillness of human beings.” Her reception was on October 22, and the exhibit ran through Monday, October 27.
Hoff had her opening reception in the gallery in the Sculpture Building on October 22, and her pieces will be exhibited through No- vember 1. Her show, “Flowers a Lover,” is a mix of many different me- diums, including paintings, drawings, sculptures and installation. The show builds around love, with an installation of roses being the main focal point of the exhibition. “Since it’s my last semester, I wanted to put all the mediums I’ve come across to use, to make it sort of a retrospect. Also, the roses and a few drawings I’m basing it on, I felt had potential.” Hoff said. “Lately, I’ve done a lot of abstracts, but I’ve been struggling with putting color to use, but nature is a nice way for me to incorporate colors to my work.”
The artist says the exhibition is the opposite of what one would think of when thinking of giving away flowers. “It’s more as a goodbye than an act of celebration, and it fits more with my kind of art concept,” she said. “The roses hanging from the roof have a potential of falling down and breaking, and that connects with the theme I have in the paintings” she said. Hoff had her thesis show in the SAL Gallery earlier this year and will graduate in December, and she’s aiming for her MA in Art Therapy at Post.
Li and Hoff’s shows are two among many student shows in the galleries around the campus, and already next week, there will be new exhibitions in the same art spaces.

On Friday, Oct. 24, and Saturday, Oct. 25, from 6 p.m. – 11 p.m., the Music Department got into the spirit of Halloween with their 16th annual Haunted House in the Fine Arts Center. The haunted house is a guided walkthrough (about 10 min) with flashing lights and fog effects.
The Music Department’s haunted house has a theme each year. This year’s theme was Dante’s Inferno. Dante’s Inferno is a well- known story about a journey through hell. Hell is depicted as 9 circles of suffering deep within the earth. The haunted house depicted various stages of hell.
Prices were relatively inexpensive compared to other haunted houses, at $7 for adults, $6 with an LIU student ID or for anyone in costume, and $5 for children. The money raised from the haunted house will be used for the Music Department’s Convocation Series, which is now required for all music students to take in order to complete their undergraduate career at LIU.
Before the event Emily Plunkett, a junior Music Education major, said “This year is going to be a notch above the rest because so many different personalities will participate to make this an amazing year for our haunted house.” This will be Plunkett’s third time as an actor in the haunted house. Plunket and the other actors in the haunted house are all LIU Post students, and they have a lot of fun doing it. Candy was given out to the children who attended in a designated “children’s room”.
The haunted house had child-friendly features, including an easily accesible exits as well as a waiting room for children (or scared adults) who are overwhelmed. The haunted house is publicly advertised, drawing attendees from the local area. Both resident students and commuters can enjoy a yearly haunted house that is nearby and inexpensive for college students on a budget. This haunted house is set up for success—between the eager and talented student actors, the incredible artwork and design provided by the Art department, and the air of creepiness about the place, this year’s haunted house was to die for!

The Port Washington Play Troupe, in partnership with WCWP, the campus radio station, will be performing “War of the Worlds” as part of their Fall Radio Drama Series. The performance, which will feature actors reading from original radio drama scripts on stage in front of a live studio audience, will be presented Oct. 30, at 8:00 p.m. in the Hillwood Recital Hall. The performance will be recorded for future broadcast. Howard Koch’s adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel, “War of the Worlds,” is the story of a fictitious alien invasion, and is part of the Play Troupe’s 2014 Golden Era of Radio Celebration, set to thrill and haunt listeners as it did nearly 80 years ago.
“War of the Worlds” was originally aired on Oct. 30, 1938, on CBS radio, and was made infamous by stage and screen legend Orson Welles. It was presented as a series of simulated news bulletins, which suggested to the public that an actual alien invasion was happening. The radio drama caused mass panic and complaints from the general public, and to make things even worse, the original broadcast was aired a day before Halloween.
This partnership between the radio station and Port Washington’s troupe began in the spring of 2014. The first three performances that were produced included “The Maltese Falcon,” “Casablanca,” and “The Thin Man.”
Dan Cox, director of Broadcasting at WCWP, acts as the producer of the events, coordinating the venue, ticketing, technology, and promotion. He explained how the partnership started. “I was looking for a group that want[ed] to perform radio plays from the 1930s and 40s in front of a live audience,” said Cox. “I reached out to LIU Post alumnus Tony Traguardo, who works in the Media Department of the Port Washington Public Library [with the idea.] Tony introduced me to Pamela Meadows, the president of the Play Troupe of Port Washington. I pitched her the idea and she took it back to her group’s board of directors who thought it would be a great partnership.”
Cox went on to discuss his experience with the radio drama series. “My parents are 90-years-old, they grew up with radio before the invention of TV,” he explained. “They had recordings of these programs from the 30s and 40s. I grew up with ‘old time radio.’ I listened to them as a child and thought this was the coolest way to hear a story. When I was an undergraduate at LIU Post a few decades ago, there was a radio drama class where we produced radio plays. I was always hooked on these stories and the process in which they are produced. They are fun to listen to, [as well as] watch being performed [live.]”
“Listening to the performers and forming the images in my mind is the most fun part, ‘seeing’ the story,” he exclaimed. “These old radio plays were called ‘theater of the mind,’ allowing each listener to create their own interpretation of what the person looks like and how the action is happening. Play Troupe has also added songs [from] the period to each show between acts. It is very entertaining.”
David Barnett, the production’s musical director, pianist, and the sound effect specialist, discussed his involvement in the show. “I am putting together a four-piece combo to back up the singers who will perform during scene and act breaks,” Barnett explained. “I am also dusting off my vintage R.A. Moog [sound player] to [create] the many sound effects which will be heard throughout the show.”
“We have six actors: two for the primary male and female roles, plus four who will play several roles each,” continued Barnett. “We have a live Foley artist providing many sound effects performed live, and prerecorded [effects] using a variety of devices and techniques. We have two [sound effect specialists] to get that classic, spacey, 50s sci-fi sound for the spaceships and the aliens. We also have two featured singers who will perform period songs during scene and act breaks, with the four- piece combo to back them up. Other than the sounds of explosions and trucks, which will be prerecorded, everything will be performed live.”
Though the broadcast is not your traditional stage production, live radio performances still face the same challenges as live theatre. “The primary thing I need to keep in mind is what’s coming next,” said Barnett. “Whether it’s a sound effect cue, a music cue or a song, it needs to flow from what came before so there is no dead air in the show. The pacing of all the elements needs to be precise so they work together and produce an intelligible result.”
Margaret Werner, who plays the lead female role, Sylvia van Buren, discussed the difference with performing a radio drama versus a “normal” play. “The actors do not have to memorize the script, there is no set, and all of the action is represented by the sound person. Additionally, one actor may play several different roles. Historically, radio plays were created for a home audience gathered around the family radio. Therefore, it was routine to have one actor voice several characters simply by changing his or her voice and speech patterns.” Werner explained how having to speak into a microphone changes your performance. “While I am performing, I keep in mind that I need to stay at the proper distance from the microphone, that I need to speak clearly for the listening audience, and that timing is crucial when working with sound effects.”
If you’re looking for a little fright before All Hallows’ Eve, then head down to the recital hall in Hillwood Commons. Sit back and enjoy “War of the Worlds,” a haunting blast from the past. As realistic as the performance may be, please be assured that it is only a play. Or is it? WCWP will broadcast the radio presentation on Dec. 13, at 7 p.m. on their website mywcwp.org.

On Saturday, Oct. 25, the men’s soccer team (11-3-1) took on the Mercy College Mavericks (3-12) and defeated their East Coast Conference rival from Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., by a score of 4-3. The Pioneers claimed the victory and in doing so, pushed their winning streak to a season high of seven games.
The scoring got underway in the 26th minute as junior midfielder Matias Ruiz found the back of the net to give the Pioneers the early 1-0 lead. Ruiz took advantage of the Mavericks goalie being too far out of his net, and kicked a shot from 40 yards out. With the early goal, the Pioneers did not let up, as they scored their second goal of the match less than two minutes later.
After a pass from Ruiz, junior midfielder Per Forgaard weaved his way through the defense and beat the Mercy keeper, putting the Pioneers up two goals.
However, despite the growing momentum for LIU, Mercy was not down for the count. A goal from senior midfielder Danny Leon Jr. cut the lead in half and kept the Mavericks in the game. Looking to answer the goal, the Pioneers turned to freshman forward Jason Lampkin. He found senior forward Eivind Austboe who managed to guide the ball passed the keeper, making the score 3-1 in favor of the Pioneers.
With the game nearing halftime and Pioneers with all the momentum, they chose not to let their foot off the gas pedal. In the 43rd minute, the Pioneers took advantage of a corner kick and were able to score again. Sophomore defender Joey Forgaard found the net after a rebound.
In the second half, Mercy increased its offensive intensity, firing a total of 10 shots. The score remained at 4-1 until the 85th minute, when junior midfielder Juan Gatti received the ball from senior midfielder Jonathan Garcia and was able to penetrate the Pioneer defense and score to slice the led in half. With the score now 4-2, the Mavericks made it even closer with a goal in the closing seconds, but the clock finally struck midnight on their comeback efforts as they fell short.
The Pioneers will take their momentum with them when they travel to Rochester, N.Y. to take on Roberts Wesleyan University on Friday, Oct. 31. Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and his squad will take the field at 7.30 p.m.

On Friday, Oct. 24, the women’s swimming team hosted its first meet of the season and notched a win against the University of Bridgeport at the Pratt Natatorium.
Junior Meghan Brazier started the evening for the Pioneers with a win in the 50-yard freestyle, as she hit the wall at a time of 24.41. The Green Machine then saw itself beaten by the Purple Knights in the 200- yard freestyle race, but came back strong in the team events.
In the 200-yard freestyle relay, freshman Laura Bendfelt, senior Courtney Delehanty, junior Joyce Kwok, and Brazier raced to a time of 1:37.04. In the medley ditto, senior Johanna Pettersson, freshman Erika Hultman, Kwok, and Brazier clinched a 1:46.38 time, which was clocked as an NCAA provisional qualification time. As the evening came to a close, the Pioneers won seven events, and racked up 117 total points, beating its opponent’s by 82.
After the season-opener at home, the Pioneers were back in action again on Saturday, Oct. 25. The away trip to Central Connecticut State University ended with the same total of wins for the Green and Gold, yet with a close defeat to the hosts overall.
The first event of the day was the 200-yard medley relay, raced by junior Seren Jones, junior Marthe Soerensen, Hultman, and Delehanty. The squad fell short with the time of 1:49:79, which declared the visitors’ faith, as they landed second by less than a 10th of a second. From that point on, the two teams both clinched significant wins in their individual events. Kwok won both the 100 and 200-yard butterfly events, marking two NCAA “B” cut times respectively.
The Pioneers stood for an outstanding double-finish in the 50- yard freestyle event as Bendfeldt and Brazier finished at 24.83 and 24.97 to clinch the two first spots. But despite a win even in the last relay, the 400-yard freestyle, the hosts from Connecticut won the day with the close score of 141-121.
Head Coach Maureen Travers and the team are now looking to continue their winning-streak at home on Saturday, Nov. 1, when they face East Stroudsburg University. The teams are set to hit the water at 1 p.m.

On Saturday, Oct. 25, the football team (5-3) suffered a nail-biting 27-24 defeat at the hands of Northeast-10 Conference rival American International in a battle for first place at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
The Yellow Jackets (6-2) struck first on a 17-yard touchdown pass via senior quarterback Kevin Arduino to senior wide-out Stephan Davis with 2:40 remaining in the opening period. AIC took advantage of a fumble on the Pioneer 22-yard line and just three plays later, Arduino connected with Davis for seven points.
In the second period, the Green and Gold managed to reduce the gap to 7-3. However, the Yellow Jackets pieced together a quick three-play drive resulting in a touchdown, putting the visitors up 14-3 at halftime. Arduino hooked up with senior wide out Maurice Easterling on a 69-yard pass at the one-minute mark.
During the third quarter, the Pioneers scored a touchdown on their third possession to cut the deficit to four points. Red-shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino staged an eight-play, 34-yard drive that resulted in a five-yard scramble into the end zone.
The contest was ultimately decided in the fourth quarter. After AIC missed an extra-point attempt, LIU Post put up 14 unanswered points to grab its first lead of the game at 24-20. Laurino first tossed a 23-yard touchdown strike to red-shirt sophomore wide receiver Shane Hubbard with 5:35 left. That made the score 20-17.
On the Yellow Jackets’ following possession, Arduino drove his team into Pioneer territory, but red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti picked him off at the LIU 32-yard line, and subsequently returned the interception to the AIC 31. On the ensuing snap, LIU Post ran an end-around to red-shirt freshman receiver James Higgins and he fired a 37-yard pass to a wide-open Laurino for the go-ahead touchdown.
The Yellow Jackets answered immediately as Arduino led his team down to the Pioneer four-yard line. Shortly thereafter, on a fourth-and-one, Arduino got a push over the goal line to put the visitors back ahead. The Pioneers kept battling back, as Laurino completed three straight passes to set up the hosts in field goal range. Senior kicker Karsten Viste missed a 41-yard try as time expired.
The Boise-native finished the game 32-of-51, passing for 353 yards and a touchdown. Hubbard hauled in nine receptions for a team-leading 123 yards and a score while junior tight end Sean Binckes caught seven balls for 75 yards. Defensively, Brunetti led the Green and Gold with eight tackles. Red-shirt junior linebacker Brandon Cheney recorded seven tackles and junior defensive back Jahleel Oswald had six stops.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers return to action on Saturday, Nov. 1 when they travel to New Haven, Conn., for a matinee showdown against NE-10 rival Southern Connecticut State. Kickoff is set for 12 p.m.

Coming off their loss against Dowling College on Tuesday, Oct. 21, the women’s volleyball team (15-11) looked to bounce back against the Lions
from Molloy College (10-13) on Thursday, Oct. 23, from Quealy Gymnasium in Rockville Centre, N.Y. The Pioneers outlasted the Lions in five sets as three different players recorded double-digit kill performances for the visitors.
With the two sides tied at seven in the first set, the Pioneers went on a 6-1 spurt to grab a 13-8 advantage. The Lions responded however, eventually drawing even at 17. The Pioneers managed to claim the first set with help from freshman middle blocker Danielle Valenza, who captured the final kill of the set. The Lions regained their composure and won a hard fought second set 25-23 to even the match at 1-1.
The crucial third set saw the visitors rally from four points down to even the match at 14. Key blocks from Valenza and freshman middle blocker Heather Ball sparked the Green and Gold. With the set later tied at 21, the Pioneers scored four of the set’s final five points to claim the upper hand. Junior setter Monica Amador provided two kills during that span. The perseverance of the Lions was on display in the fourth set as they won the do-or-die game to even up the match at two sets a side.
In the deciding fifth set, the Pioneers jumped out to a 10-3 lead and never looked back. Amador notched back-to-back kills in the streak while Ball chipped in two kills of her own. Graduate outside hitter Katie Hudencial served two aces during the span as well. The Pioneers cruised in the final set, earning their sixth win in their last seven matches. Sophomore middle hitter Analise Austin totaled 14 digs to go along with her five kills while junior setter Lulu Centro accumulated 47 assists.
The Pioneers returned home to Pratt Recreation Center to welcome the Bentley University Falcons (13-8) on Friday, Oct. 24. The five-game home stand for the Pioneers started with a bang as they defeated the Falcons in straight sets en route to their seventh win in their last eight matches.
The Pioneers battled back two separate times in the opening set and found themselves tied with the Falcons at 22. The Pioneers earned the next three points and the opening set. The second set saw more of the same for the Pioneers as they rallied
late to draw within striking distance. Trailing late in the set, LIU got key kills from junior libero Rachel Ringor and senior middle blocker Heather Adams to pull even at 22. Adams teamed up with junior middle hitter Melissa Hansen to secure the 2-0 advantage for the hosts.
After their 11th tie of the final set at 16, the Pioneers won the next three points and never looked back. With help from unforced errors by the Falcons and two kills by Valenza, the Pioneers won the hard fought set and match by a score of 3-0.
Head coach Shellane Ogoshi and the Pioneers return to action on Thursday, Oct. 30, when they welcome Southern Connecticut State University to Brookville N.Y. First serve is set for 7 p.m.
