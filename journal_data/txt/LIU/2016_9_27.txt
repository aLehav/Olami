The presidential candidates clashed in their first debate Monday night at Hofstra University in the most watched presidential debate in the history of televised debate. According to CNN, the debate was viewed on television by more than 80 million people and on the Internet by millions more.
Over 7,000 Hofstra students entered a lottery to win the 200 tickets available for the debate. One of the lucky Hofstra students who won a ticket was sophomore business major Emily Basile. “Being one of the students lucky enough to have won a ticket to the first presidential debate of 2016 is an indescribable feeling. Being inside of the debate was an eye opening experience because the media tends to sway in the direction of their own perception of each candidate, so watching it live was a different experience compared to television.”
Angela Curcio, a sophomore political science major at Hofstra, recounted her experience on campus before the debate. “Having my school host the first presidential debate was such an amazing experience. Throughout the day of the debate, students were allowed to walk around campus and take part in interviews as well as be live on the news sets of Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC. In my opinion, Hofstra did an amazing job making the students feel safe while also making the students want to be a part of this time in history.”
The debate moderator, NBC Nightly News’ Lester Holt, posed questions in three areas: “America’s Direction,” “Achieving Prosperity” and “Securing America.” Holt questioned the candidates about their economic plans, how they would heal racial divides, how they would combat cyber attacks and ISIS, and if the candidates would respect the outcome of the election. Along the way, the inevitable topics were addressed, such as Trump’s taxes and Clinton’s emails.
After the debate, Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with Holt’s choice of questions by tweeting “Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi.” Clinton tweeted after the debate “43 days left. Let’s go win this thing #DebateNight.”
New York newspapers quickly commented on the debate, some coming as soon as a half hour after-the-fact. The New York Times editorial board wrote: “On balance, she (Clinton) pulled it off, swatting his attacks aside and confidently delivering her own criticisms from higher, firmer ground.” Newsday’s editorial board took a more centrist opinion, “On Monday night, neither candidate lost. But the nation won when both said they would support the outcome of the election.”
The first debate was not without controversy off stage as Green Party candidate Jill Stein was escorted off of the Hofstra campus for not having the appropriate credentials to be on the site, according to Newsday. Stein has a history of running into roadblocks at presidential debates as she was arrested in 2012 for protesting outside of the Hofstra campus during another presidential debate, according to FOX news.
The Green Party candidate, and the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, did not participate in Monday’s debate as neither candidate met the requirements set by the presidential commission on debates.
On the Post campus, dozens of students gathered in The End Zone to watch the debate at the campus life sponsored screening party and many more congregated in dorm room viewing parties. The Pioneer surveyed 40 students at the LIU Post screening party about who they thought won the debate; 74 percent of the surveyed students thought that Clinton won the debate and 21 percent thought that neither candidate was a clear winner. Seventy nine percent of the surveyed students thought that the questions presented by debate moderator, Lester Holt, were either reasonable or fair; and 22 percent thought that the questions were either too easy or too broad.
The first Vice-Presidential debate between Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and Indiana Governor Mike Pence will take place Tuesday, Oct. 4, and will be moderated by CBS News’ Elaine Quijano.
The second presidential debate is scheduled to take place Sunday, Oct. 9, at 9 p.m. The debate will be moderated by CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Martha Raddatz.
The third debate will take place on Wednesday, Oct. 19, at the University of Nevada, moderated by FOX News Sunday’s Chris Wallace.

The student run magazine, The Bottom Line, will be revived on Oct. 26, with the mission of informing and educating students, staff, and faculty about what’s going on in the world, beyond our campus realm.
The Bottom Line, published last semester online, will return to the world of print alongside its website, www.liupostbottomline.com.
“Students want a hard copy in their hands,” said Grace Oshin, a senior broadcasting major and journalism minor, who has taken over as the editor of The Bottom Line this year. Jeremie Rosario, a freshman pharmacy major, agreed. “I would prefer a hard copy, because it can physically get my attention,” he said.
The Bottom Line’s first issue of the fall semester will contain 16 pages, front-to-back, following the 2016 presidential election and its political impact on fashion, lifestyle, and culture in the U.S. Oshin hopes that connecting these topics in a “cool and creative way” will grab students’ attention.
Returning not only with a renewed domain, the magazine’s layout joins the renaissance with a pop of color. Past issues had mostly black and white pages, with the cover in color, but Oshin plans to change that. “I want people to be attracted to it,” she said. Cover designer Candice Licalzi, an M.S. student in arts education, has much in store for the first issue. The cover will feature her own art style.
Creative minds are at work behind the magazine’s production. Oshin and her newly built staff want to make the magazine stand out with fun and interactive content both online and in print. Previously, The Bottom Line was a platform for ideas that did not cover many topics of interest to the students, from what Oshin has heard. “I don’t want to stifle anyone’s creativity,” she said.
The online edition of the magazine will allow readers to take quizzes, submit ideas, answer polls, watch videos, and leave comments. The addition of the magazine’s social media links on the website will make it more user friendly, an aspect of the website that has been lacking.
“I am very pleased to see The Bottom Line is coming back to life,” said Barbara Fowles, chairperson of the department of communications and film. The magazine will serve as another home for different forms of writing other than conventional news, making room for longer articles, and to feature pictures and artwork by students. “It would be wonderful if students around campus were to begin to see The Bottom Line as a publication where they can display their talents to the entire community,” Fowles added.
The magazine staff believes that a print platform is essential to attract students, who already are bombarded by options to read online. Oshin does not want to disappoint her staff. “I want to see them proud of their work,” she said.

A mumps outbreak that originated in Long Beach, just over twenty miles from campus, continues to grow among the young adult population.
On Aug. 1, the Nassau County Department of Health released information about looking further into a sudden outbreak of the virus among young adults in Long Beach around the age of 25 years. According to Healio Infectious Disease News, by Aug. 23 the infected patient count reached 36, which doubled the original amount reported at the start of the month.
Mary Ellen Laurain, spokeswoman for Nassau County Department of Health (DOH), shared with Healio that the Long Beach area is not highly populated once the summer comes to an end. Does that mean all infected summer residents of the area will return to their full time location and expand the range of cases on Long Island?
“It’s not something we can predict,” Laurain said in her interview with Healio. There are precautions that can be taken as the infection is shared through saliva or mucus. By avoiding sharing objects that have contact with your mouth, the risk of expanding the infection may decrease.
According to campus nurse Conni Montalbano, LIU is closely monitoring information from the Nassau DOH. “The best way to prevent the spread of the mumps virus is never to share food, drinks, eating utensils, or any other item that may contain saliva,” Montalbano said. “Symptoms of mumps include swollen cheeks, headache, fever, muscle aches, stiff neck, loss of appetite, and fatigue.”
Senior speech pathology major Gab Dellorusso had no idea that the virus was something to be concerned about. “It’s scary and dangerous,” she said. Dellorusso was surprised the school hadn’t made the student body aware of the outbreak or any precautions that could be taken. “I wish an email would have been sent out. Is there a vaccine?”
The vaccine for mumps is combined with the vaccine for measles and rubella. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended. For vaccination appointments offered at the NYIT Academic Health Care Center, where many of the university’s health services are now provided, contact nurse Montalbano in The Center for Healthy Living, Life Science Room 154, or through extension 3477.

Fresh fruit smoothies are now available to students at the brand new smoothie bar at the Hillwood Cafe located in Hillwood Commons. It is open from 7:00 a.m. – 2:30 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays.
The bar has a variety of fresh fruit including berries, tropical fruits and more. Many students in college gain weight—everyone’s heard of the alleged “Freshmen 15”—perhaps because there is just so much work and so little time.
Some students are burdened with deadlines, tests, schoolwork, and even jobs. For most, there just never seems to be enough time in one day to do everything that needs to be done in college. Work builds up and energy levels drop low as the months pass by.
“I haven’t even tried it yet. I just found out about it,” said Griffin Lockette, a sophomore musical theatre major. “There are so many people walking around with it that you can’t miss it. I definitely want to try it soon.”
People try to stay healthy, students and athletes all included. Imagine running between two classes that have approximately a ten minute gap, trying to get something from the cafeteria that will fill you up, wake you up, and your options either cost you your health in the long run, or thirty extra minutes in the gym.
“I know this is kind of embarrassing but I’ve tried all the flavors. I have to say that the mixed berry one is my favorite,” said Christine Mackerer, also a sophomore theater major. “It’s literally the most perfect snack to grab before class.”
The menu includes: Ginger and Carrot Smoothie, Strawberry Banana Smoothie, Tropical Fruit Smoothie, Very Berry Smoothie, and Mango Smoothie. For those who wish to add a scoop of protein, it is available upon additional charge. The smoothies themselves are $4.59, and with the additional protein boost they add $0.60 cents to the total. The location is central to most of the classrooms and it takes about one- and-a-half minute to make.
“They need to put healthier things out there on the counter to choose from. I mean it’s already pretty healthy but I think it would be better if they had some greens out there too,” said Heena Kewalramani, a senior and an international business major, and student-athlete. “Like a vegetable smoothie I guess. Also, they add a syrup or juice and it tastes too sweet. They should add way less syrup and it should be on the student’s request as an option. Other than that, I like it and I’d recommend it to people too.”

Among the changes on campus this semester that have the student body buzzing are the changes to the food service. The changes this semester include things that students can see and feel, but this change the students can taste. The revamping of the food services is largely a result of the new leadership of the Aramark team on campus.
Ed Taraskewich, the president district manager of Aramark at the Post and Brooklyn campuses, and Dave Jagsarran, the director of catering services, are now leading the campus Aramark team.
Jagsarran came to Post in June, three months ago. He has 17 years of experience leading food service teams at two nearby universities, serving as the director of catering at SUNY Stony Brook for 12 years and at Columbia University for five years in the same role.
Jagsarran has led an effort to revamp the catering department on campus, expanding menus and making catering more affordable for clubs and organizations. Presentation is one of Jagsarran’s focuses.
“We want to make people’s dining experience exciting again.” He said that the biggest strength of the new Aramark team was “teamwork; we don’t play.”
Taraskewich has been heading the Aramark team since April. He has been in higher education food service for 25 years and has worked at universities across the nation, including at M.I.T., St.John’s and Texas A&M. The new leadership team, he said, aims at delivering the best quality products, and consistency.
“One thing I’m big on, today’s achievements don’t become roadblocks to future success,” he said. “We’re not a specialty food, we’re everything food. We have to be everything, which means always being on top of what’s good for your customers and the students that go here. It’s always a work in progress.”
Along with the changes in Aramark’s on-campus leadership have come several logistical changes to Aramark’s operation at Post. The Winnick POD has been remodeled and now carries an expanded line of frozen foods, snack, cereals, toiletries, and a soon-to-be gluten free station.
The Winnick POD will be open 6-11 p.m., seven days a week. Last year, it was open from 7-11 p.m., five days a week. The Humanities POD has closed, for unspecified reasons. Hillwood Cafe now offers homemade fruit smoothies and daily specials. The menus for Winnick will be available in advance on liu. campusdish.com. A new menu will be offered in the End Zone for late night dining.
There have been behind-the-scenes changes, as well. Aramark has introduced a new training program that focuses on customer service and food safety. “We want to train our team members to be the best in their position; that’s an Aramark philosophy,” Taraskewich said.
Some students have noticed the changes this semester. “I do see some changes that aren’t as noticeable, but are still there,” said Miranda Alldaffer, a sophomore biomedicine major. “The food that they’re catering now is a lot more diverse so that’s great to see, and there have been some good additions to Winnick like the new flavored water machines. I know they’re not big changes like everyone is expecting but there are little improvements.”
“Aramark has really stepped up this year,” said Brianna Pisano, a senior accounting major, and the student government president. “They have stepped up on all levels including customer service, quality of the food and their dedication to delivering the students the best product they can. They truly want to make sure everyone campus wide is enjoying their dining experience and they are putting their best foot forward to prove that, it’s very encouraging to see.”
Abby VanVlerah, dean of students, said that the changes have been good. “Students have largely responded positively to the new options Aramark offers both in catering and in the campus dining facilities,” she said. “The new management has put a great deal of work into increasing the quality of offerings and customer service. We are fortunate to have so many dining options on a campus of our size.”
Editor’s Note: Adam Hornbuckle is the vice president of the student government association.

With the fall semester just a few weeks old, residents are already complaining about the Winnick dining hall. Not only are most of the options that they have to choose from unhealthy, according to students. But Winnick has also run out of what seems to be the most popular item on its menu within its first two days, grilled chicken.
Winnick has, in the past, had many options during the first weeks of school. Not this semester. Even though the dining hall does have a salad bar, students have said that it doesn’t offer any protein besides grilled chicken to go with the lettuce. And, the grilled chicken has not been available, said students.
Some students may find this grilled chicken “mishap” funny, but for others on the Post campus, it is truly traumatizing. Many residents on campus request grilled chicken. From athletes to your everyday student, they are trying to be healthy.
Taylor McNamara, a senior psychology major and resident on campus, went to Winnick last Wednesday to find no grilled chicken because they had run out. She then asked if there were any turkey burgers, but there were none. “Being that grilled chicken is the most high demand choice for dinner, having them run out before 6 p.m., the normal dinner time, doesn’t make any sense,” McNamara said. “If they know that grilled chicken is what everyone wants, why do they not order a higher supply?”
Samantha Negron, a senior broadcasting major and resident, said, “Personally I don’t like to always eat red meat and I don’t particularly like the entrees served at Winnick for dinner.” She added that Winnick is always serving burgers at the grill station, but grilled chicken always seem to run out at a certain point during the day.
“It sucks because I would much rather eat that than anything else in Winnick on any given day of the week,” Negron said. “It’s healthier than most options they serve. Plus their grilled chicken is some of the best food on the Winnick menu and it’s just annoying that they don’t always have it even when they say it’s on the menu.”
With no other healthy options available at the Winnick salad bar besides lettuce, some students resort to cereal. Others say they begin to gain weight. A third group spends money on food outside of campus, which arguably defeats the purpose of a meal plan, and it does concern some parents.
Natalie Mashaal, a public speaking professor who has a daughter attending The University of Michigan, said that she would be upset if her daughter didn’t have healthy food choices, “I’m upset for her because she now has limited food options that are high in calories or not good for her, which now causes her to go out and buy food with the money I am giving her.”

“I thought it would be an interesting challenge to teach something new,” said Lloyd Siegel, who joined the journalism program in the department of communications and film this fall. Siegel is currently teaching Journalistic Interviewing, a cross-listed journalism and broadcasting class this semester.
He has taught many other subjects at the Columbia university graduate school of journalism, and at Montclair state university school of communication and media. However, this is a new task for him, and with all the experience he acquired from his many years in the journalism field, it “felt right” for him. Siegel has previously taught news management, audience engagement, media writing and many other subjects in the journalism and media field.
“I worked for NBC news for 44 years,” he said, starting as a local reporter in Cleveland, Ohio. While living in Cleveland, Siegel was able to jump through multiple fields. He graduated from Ohio State University and has since been living the dream he’s always had.
At NBC universal, he was vice president of news partnerships, and before that the director of news partnerships and a domestic producer for NBC nightly news. He received the first amendment service award from the radio television digital news foundation for contributions to the television industry in 2013.
“I don’t have any regrets,” Siegel said, later saying the only regret was not getting his master’s degree. But Siegel still has hopes in receiving his master’s on top of decades of real-world experience that he imparts to his students.
“My students are actually out interviewing people right now,” Siegel said, while wondering when he’ll be able to grade all his papers. “The journalism field is evolving but [is] also promising, many doors are opening for journalists but you have to be able to learn more than just one side of being a journalist in order to be successful.” Today most students get their news and information from Instagram or Facebook, or any other social media outlet. Compared to the days where you had one person writing and one person shooting video, nowadays one person is asked to do both, and do it quicker.
“I think it’s a great class to have, especially in your freshman year,” said Shakira Clarke, a public relations major who would have liked to take the class. “Being able to interview someone is sometimes hard but with a class like this, I think I would be able to get over what’s holding me back from holding a great interview and probably becoming one of the best,” she added. Siegel is a beloved husband and father, and a new resource in the Post community.

If a picture is worth more than 1,000 words, the graffiti on the halls, stalls, and bookshelves on campus would be priceless. As students weave their way, eagerly or anxiously through the bookshelves of the library, chances are they’ll feast their eyes on profane phrases and images illustrated by student “graffiti specialists.”
So, how does one earn the title, ‘graffiti specialist’? Very simple. In a covert, stealth like manner, the individual stains campus property with graffiti, while managing not to be caught by administration, or a member of Post’s custodial staff.
Thousands of students walk through the halls of Post hourly, so capturing one of these vandals is essentially the equivalent of finding a needle in a haystack. However, work done by Post’s graffiti specialists hardly, if ever, goes unnoticed.
Jalen Benson, a sophomore Political Science major, recounted a story about a piece of unsolicited art work. “I had just gotten out of my 9:30 a.m. political science class and bee-lined it to the men’s bathroom on the second floor of Humanities Hall, and boom, before I knew it, I was reading an ‘inspirational message’ from someone who called himself, ‘The Pooping Prophet,’” Benson said.
Benson is not the only student to encounter graffiti on campus this semester. Gabriella Vitolo, a senior business major, saw graffiti last week in the library, while searching for a textbook. “Plain and simple, there were images that I would expect to see in a middle school’s library, not a college library,” Vitolo said.
“It’s defacement of school property,” said Melissa Hinton, the assistant dean of technical & digital services at the library. In astern tone, Hinton expressed her distaste for the school’s graffiti problem, pleading to the culprits, “It’s your home away [from] home. Have pride in your institution and maintain it. Don’t deface LIU property.”
Hinton referred to page 32 of the 2015-16 student handbook. That section specifically goes over the ‘Goals and Benefits of the Academy.’ Stressing the importance of student ethics both on and off campus, the handbook reiterates that responsible behavior is vital to making LIU a reputable and professional institution of learning.
When asked if she had ever caught a student vandalizing the library, Hinton said, “No, but if a student is caught in the act they’d be sent to Public Safety, and from there, sent to the Dean.”
The office of public safety declined to comment on the graffiti. The facilities services department, headed by William Kirker, is the department left with the necessary, but not glamorous responsibility of cleaning and maintaining the dormitories, library and academic halls.
“We do our absolute best to keep our campus as clean as possible for students and faculty alike,” Kirker said.

Illegal parking has expanded throughout campus. With Public Safety not offering advice or cautions about parking, 50 percent of the student body that commutes are taking own initiatives when parking their cars.
Diamond White, a senior musical theatre major, and commuter from Jamacia, Queens, for two years has now switched to being a resident student. A key reason for her switch was because the parking situation was “plain awful.”
“I usu- ally tried to park as close to Kahn or the Little Theatre as possible being that all of my classes were in the theatre building, but there were times where I literally had to park at the dorms,” White said. Her biggest frustrations came when Tilles had shows during school hours. “There’s no parking and we all have class. Where are we expected to go when you block off two full parking lots for shows at Tilles?” she said.
From what she can recall, White has been ticketed 11 times total. She has received tickets in areas without any limitations or signs restricting student parking. Recently she has been ticketed in her designated dorm lot. The school has placed holds on her account that prevents her from viewing her grades and applying for graduation.
“I’ve tried to fight most of the tickets being that a lot of times [when I got the tickets] it was because I had to simply drop stuff off,” she said. None of her arguments have been successful. However, it is possible to have ticketless success on campus. Unlike White, Chiara Marangelli has never received a ticket. The senior childhood education major has been commuting from Rosyln Heights for three consecutive years.
The seasoned commuter has found the strategy that comes with traveling to campus everyday. “You have to learn to figure out the times when not a lot of commuters have gotten to campus and parked yet,” she said. “If you give yourself some extra time in the morning, it’ll guarantee you a spot.” On snowy days, or days when lots are limited, Marangelli admits to having to park illegally but was fortunate to be overseen by public safety.
Which is the bigger issue? The first come, first serve procedures that the few lots follow, or Public Safety’s inconsistency toward ticketing vehicles. Though certain questions may only be answered through their office, Public Safety was unable to speak on behalf of the department.

Home-cooked meals and the diner around the corner are some of the things students who dorm often find themselves missing. For students, it can be a constant struggle of whether or not to use those dining dollars at Hillwood, or go to the dining hall three or more times a day.
Cravings can also pose an issue for students living on campus, and for those midnight munchies, most college students want instant gratification, which many local take-out restaurants are more than happy to provide.
Whether you are a weather-worn senior, a newly instated freshie or anything in between, a wide variety of quality food is what all residents long for. And most importantly, students want reputable and relatively cheap food that is conveniently delivered right to campus. After a broad survey across campus about what students here really enjoy, I was able to put together a list of five places with the “highest quality” of reviews from our peers.
Sun Ho, a Chinese restaurant that delivers right to campus for, (wait for it…) FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS, was definitely number one in what students first thought of when asked what their favorite takeout place was. There is no fine print involved; it actually costs $5. This deal is a college-friendly discount that they offer students here, and in the surrounding area.
“I love the shrimp lo mein and the affordable prices makes it really convenient,” said Crystal Ellington, a junior biology major. Another strong advocate for Sun Ho is Joe Piscitelli, a sophomore criminal justice major. The sesame seed chicken is my favorite thing to order,” he said.
Another take-out place that broke the charts was Domino’s. They have a multitude of options for anyone looking for something quick and easy at 1 a.m., or whenever you personally desire.
“I find ordering from Domino’s super convenient and helpful during a day where I need to focus on studying,” said Tianna D’Italia, a freshman business major. Brittany Alexander, a senior social work major, agrees.
“It’s the easiest pizza place around and seriously, who doesn’t love their parmesan bites?” she said. Domino’s does offer student discounts through student coupon websites, such as Coupon Follow and Save the Student.
Similarly, Abeetza offers a wide range of artisan pizzas and hand rolls with other traditional Italian fare for take-out. “I love the white pizza and chicken parm hero and even though it is a little expensive, the quality stands for itself,” said Sydney Robinson, a sophomore musical theater major. Though Abeetza only offers student discount on eat-in or take-out, Abeetza is an interesting choice when you are craving a little taste of home.
Wing Zone is another popular place in the area that delivers to campus. It has a variety of different wings with a plethora of sauces to choose from, as well as other typical fast food items like chicken fingers, fries, and burgers. “I highly recommend the boneless buffalo wings, which are typically very popular,” said Joe DeStefano, a freshman business major. Justin Hansen, a sophomore criminal justice major, weighs in. “I really like the mild to hot wings which has a really great flavor to them.” Wing Zone does offer student discounts when you sign up for an account, but there are also additional coupons available through alternative sites similar to Domino’s.
BoBo’s Kitchen is another take out place offering Chinese food. It offers a lot more options than Sun Ho does and mimics the Chinese take-out that most students are accustomed to from home. BoBo’s offers a variety
of pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, and vegetarian dishes. “I highly recommend the pork lo mein and this is seriously one of my favorite places to get food from,” said Samantha Mullins, a sophomore business administration major.
Although, these are not the only options around campus, they definitely rak top five amongst surveyed students. Send in the name of your favorite take-out or delivery crib to liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

Allie Wise, a freshman double majoring in marketing and environmental science, has been immersed into college life for nearly two- and-a-half weeks, and she has already begun to make her presence known. Wise is the Vice President of Human Resources for the student- run businesses on campus as well as Vice President of recruitment for Phi Beta Lambda (PBL).
Wise, just like many other students on campus, expressed her interest in being involved with the businesses on campus and she worked tirelessly over the summer with her peers, both upperclassmen and freshmen, to prepare for the upcoming school year. She helped recruit e-board members over the summer, who do various operational work, such as stocking and public relations. Allie was offered the job in early May of last semester, and has recruited roughly 30 e-board members since.
Her job as VP of Human Resources doesn’t stop at hiring people; Wise is also responsible for making the contracts and writing employees up if they violate said contract. As a spokesperson for the employees under all six businesses, Allie also has to play mediator in tight situations. Oftentimes she is found to be the student run business’ biggest fan.
“People who are happy at their job don’t see it as work and so they produce better work, are friendlier, and work harder,” Wise said. She is currently in charge of helping run all six student run businesses including: The End Zone, Pioneer Nation, Hutton & Post, The Student Body Boutique, The Dollhouse, and Time Out.
When she isn’t doing her VP duties, Wise is working as a floater—a helping hand to whatever business is in need at that particular time—or she is working a shift, mostly at Pioneer Nation. When asked what her favorite business is, Allie answered, “Oh no! That’s like choosing a favorite child!” Though she is wholeheartedly dedicated to all six businesses, she did confess to a preference for Pioneer Nation, the store that she works at the most.
“I love promoting Pioneer Pride and just being around people who love Post just as much as I do,” Wise said.
As VP, Wise has many responsibilities. She has set goals for herself and the businesses this semester, hoping to maintain a positive environment within the businesses that enable every employee to be happy at work. Additionally, Wise hopes to promote the businesses with key marketing strategies and have more people come in and be interested in the stores and their work.
Wise describes her work as, “a big responsibility, but one I’m happy to take. I barely feel like I’m working and I really love my job. It’s something I’d recommend everyone to get involved in even if you just stop in and chat with us.”
There are several e-board positions available. Wise often looks for people who are committed, enthusiastic, and hardworking. Work- study students are encouraged to apply, but it is not limited to just work-study. To contact Wise, email her at alexandra.wise@my.liu.edu.

That book. That quote. Wonderful. Beautiful. Life changing…ever had the words of a book jump off the page at you? Where an idea literally makes you shake with excitement, onto a very scary and unrecognized path mixed with the respect of brilliance, and it makes you read more and more.
At the moment, I am reading Aristotle’s metaphysics. It’s terrifying, completely petrifying, but it’s absolutely incredible. Being a philosophy major, maybe I am biased towards the fact that Aristotle is a God, a genius, and completely great. Yet, I would argue the fact that everyone should have an interest in what it actually is to Be, with a capital B, and what reality is, and whether we actually live in it. (Read ‘the allegory of the cave’; you’ll know what I mean).
Don’t all of us have books, which tickle something inside of us? That one book which fondled with those heart strings, or messed with YOUR head and made YOU really think about who you are and how you carry yourself? Well, I think I have the right to assume that many of those books might be about love. Am I right? Well, I have just the book for you.
“The Phaedrus.”
In fact, it’s a very short essay written by Plato, and taken from the wise guru named Socrates, who I hope you have all heard of. It’s about love. Plain and simple. Now we have to remember that Socrates believed that ‘the many’—the people who didn’t bother to acquire knowledge or ‘wisdom’—weren’t worthy of such a ‘divine’ thing as love. It’s way too sacred, way too gorgeous for the people of the materialistic world to even comprehend, let alone receive or give to another.
The first time I read this incomprehensibly stunning piece, I cried. I balled my eyes out. There are probably still tearstains on the pages, which presented me with incomparable beauty. And why? Maybe the daunting reality at what I thought was love, never was; maybe it was the fact I am a complete sucker for that type of language and how it was written. I don’t know. But it presented me with a scary realism, and with so much grace.
In hindsight, my reaction to what I read and the interpretation on which I defined my beliefs afterwards could have been improved…I began to believe that none of us could reach pure divinity of love (much like Socrates’ thought). That we are all obsessed and disillusioned by this consumeristic and materialistic world, where we can’t see further then the dollar bills or the best way to look within the current fashionistic images. I thought that all we wanted to do in terms of love is follow an Instagram page or watch videos of that ‘perfect’ couple who look like they are in complete bliss.
But, although I still believe that many of us are stuck within this ‘fake’ reality, my dogma has changed. Now I believe that we can all achieve this God-like notion of love in the purest of fashions. Yes, we may have to adopt different opinions of how we should ‘look’ in a relationship, and how we should act. We may also need to change our perception on beauty, and decide whether this is the drive of our trueness to love, or whether again, it’s a materialistic notion we have developed. But I really do believe, as a society, humans love inherently. Love, in its natural state, is within all of us.
Now, going back to the relevance and the beauty of books—something seemingly forgotten by many in our generation—we need to realize that books and essays, or articles such as “The Phaedrus,” and “The Symposium,” written thousands of years ago, are yet here at our disposal, screaming at us to be read. They want us to learn their knowledge and ‘wisdom’ of love and life. Don’t be scared. One passage I read has affected my life in such a dramatic way that it completely changed the way I look at things. It might do that for you, too. Not just the subject of love, but politics, philosophy, economics…anything you want to read, any questions you have, find the book. It’s there. It’s just waiting to be found. Go get it!

Sororities, fraternities, athletic teams, clubs, organizations. LIU and college life in general offer lots of possibilities to join a group or team. And those are just the official ones. Then there are all the other groups of people you come across; your dormitory, your different classmates and, of course, your friends.
Motivational speaker Jim Roth has said, “You are the average of the five people you spend most time with.” Even though that might be a stretch, there is no question that your closest people will affect you and you will affect them, especially if your group has a formulated purpose or goal.
Being part of a group is often touted as a positive experience. Job descriptions often require teamwork, job interviews with a group exercise is increasing in popularity, and being able to work in a team always scores high when different employers rank the most important skills they seek in hiring.
Being part of a bubble is viewed with more scepticism. Often used to describe groups of people that have their own view of the world, like religious sects and other inverted societies, the term implies being a bit cut off or isolated from the rest of the world.
In some extreme cases, the negativity connected with the term is probably well earned. There are bubbles where bullying and brainwash is used to manipulate people, especially in groups with strong hierarchal structure. But what is more interesting and relevant is the affect and peer pressure we experience on a daily basis, in the bubbles that don’t have rules or a clear hierarchal structure, like our closest friends.
Spending time with people sharing your passion, interest or opinion often amplifies that attribute. This can lead to pushing yourself, trying harder and achieving more than ever before, or even doing something you didn’t think mattered that much to you. And often this is fine, at least while you’re in the bubble with likeminded people. It is no problem setting a specific play as your life goal if you are on the football team. It is nothing weird with viewing rituals in a fraternity as the most important thing in the world if you are a member. It is when leaving that environment, that you may question whether those things really are important to you.
Often this strong drive found in mem- bers of a bubble are related to competition, and getting approval from within the group. And just like in business where corporate success can be explained by the surrounding environment and clusters, where the competitive environment is supposed to be a key factor in development and performance, the world seems to apply the same thought when it comes to people.
Bringing “the best” people together, whether in sports, academics or work, is supposed to make people evolve and perform better. But this competitive environment can also be repressive and break people. So while this strategy may be successful on a group level, it is harder to draw conclusions about what is best for every individual. This dilemma is sometimes phrased: it is better to be the big fish in the small pond than a small fish in a big pond.
Another important aspect of your bubble is happiness. According to Daniel Ariely, professor in behavioural Economics at Duke University, relativity is everything when it comes to being satisfied with life. Ariely stated that you are best off not choosing to hang out with the best and the brightest, but rather with slighter inferior versions of yourself, since this will make you feel more satisfied when comparing everything from salary to appearance.
Yet, there seem to be ways of gaining advantages if you choose your bubble wisely. Maybe it will give you that extra motivation that you need to pass an exam, run the best organization or win a national tournament. And you can probably avoid the downside by regularly stepping outside the bubble, meet someone else on campus and experience a different perspective.

“Modern Family” is one of the longest running comedy series on television, along with shows like “The Big Bang Theory,” “Family Guy,” “The Simpsons,” “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” and “Saturday Night Live.” Since premiering in 2009, the ABC sitcom has been able to create unique storylines around different characters, while keeping true to its original premise of following three unique families as they try to overcome the challenges of everyday life, while still remaining intact.
In the show, created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, Jay Pritchett is the patriarch of the three families, while his two children, Mitchell and Claire, have families of their own. Jay is in his second marriage to Gloria Delgado, a much younger woman from Colombia who has a son named Manny from a previous marriage. Together, the couple also has a son named Fulgencio Joe.
Claire is married to Phil Dunphy and has three kids named Haley, Alex and Luke. Mitchell and Cameron Tucker, who adopted a girl named Lily from Vietnam in the first season, comprise the third family.
The show stars Ed O’Neill as Jay, Sofia Vergara as Gloria, Julie Bowen as Claire, Ty Burrell as Phil, Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Mitchell, and Eric Stonestreet as Cameron. Throughout its time on air, all of the child actors have remained and grown up on the show with the exception of Lily, for whom a new actress was brought on between seasons two and three.
“Modern Family” has been very successful in giving equal character development to both the adults and kids. While one episode focused on Jay and Claire’s closet business, another revolved around Haley getting kicked out of college. In the first episode of season eight, which premiered on Sept. 21, each family’s story was separate at the beginning but managed to converge by the end. The Dunphys were vacationing in New York, the Pritchetts in Mexico, and the Tucker-Pritchetts in Missouri. After some unusual circumstances, each family ends up at Jay and Gloria’s for Father’s Day.
One of the strongest aspects of “Modern Family” has always been the chemistry between the actors. While there are standout pairs such as Cameron and Gloria, Jay and Phil, and Manny and Luke, the eight seasons have allowed each actor to pair with one another to create some memorable scenes.
Throughout its eight seasons, “Modern Family” has managed to retain the same quality of acting and writing, which has allowed it to win five consecutive Emmy awards for best comedy series. While it hasn’t won that award for the past two years, “Modern Family” has already established itself as one of the best comedy series of the 2000s. New episodes of the show air Wednesday nights at 9 p.m. on ABC. This show is for anyone who enjoys comedies or family shows.

The arrival of fall does not only signal the start of school, but also the debut of new and returning TV shows that will dominate the small screen for the coming year. One of the most riveting shows each year is “American Horror Story.”
The FX show is structured in an anthology format, with each new season focusing on a different theme and bringing in new actors and characters. This show is for viewers who enjoy horror or drama shows. Viewers should be warned of extremely violent and disturbing scenes. Previous seasons have been subtitled Murder House, Asylum, Coven, Freak Show and Hotel. However, season six, subtitled Roanoke, is different in more ways than one.
Creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk have always released the theme of the season either in the summer or late spring, giving fans ample time to speculate and devise their own theories about the season. For season six, however, Murphy and Falchuk decided to try a different strategy and keep most of the season a secret, only revealing the actors.
Last season was a first of many; it saw singer Lady Gaga make her debut as the Countess. It was also the first season without Jessica Lange, who had been a main cast member since the show premiered in 2011. For Roanoke this season, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Cuba Gooding Jr., Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Denis O’Hare, Lily Rabe, Wes Bentley, and Cheyenne Jackson will join Lady Gaga as the main cast members.
When season six premiered on Sept. 14, the iconic theme song and opening credits, which had been a staple since season one, were missing and were replaced with a title card stating, “My Roanoke Nightmare.” It claimed the story was based on true events. This season is also in a documentary style format, with two actors playing one character. Viewers are either watching one actor give an interview or watching dramatic re-enactments of events the characters are describing in the interviews. One of the problems viewers may have with the re-enactment scenes is its shift of focus between the characters, which may dust off some deeper concern for them.
Season six revolves around Matt and Shelby, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Sarah Paulson in the re-enactments and Lily Rabe and Andre Holland in the interviews. After experiencing tragedy in Los Angeles, the couple moves to North Carolina and purchases a house and large property that holds a few secrets of their own. Soon, the couple begins to hear strange noises at night. Consequently, Shelby follows a woman into the woods and stumbles upon a sacrificial ritual in the woods.
So far, Gooding Jr., Paulson, and Bassett have received the majority of the screen time in the re-enactments, with Bates, Gaga, and Bentley receiving limited screen time as supposed ghosts of the lost colony of Roanoke.
It remains to be seen if the documentary format will last the entire season or if this is just the beginning of another confusing season of “American Horror Story.” New episodes of “American Horror Story” air at 10 p.m. on FX.

Down by two goals, the women’s soccer team dug deep and pulled out a dramatic 3-2 overtime victory over Wilmington University on Wednesday, Sept. 21, at the Pioneer Soccer Park.
The Pioneers were dealt two blows in the first half and needed to re-group; halftime came at the perfect time. The Pioneers limited the damage in the first half and were down 2-0 at the horn. Less than four minutes into the latter 45-minute session, the Pioneers cut the deficit in half when senior midfielder Sarah McGarry went top shelf to get the Pioneers on the board. Just minutes later, the Pioneers scored again to pull even. This time, sophomore back Alice Schonfeldt fired a shot that had a date with the net, evening the score.
At the end of regulation, the Pioneers had a few golden opportunities turned away, but seemed to have momentum going their way to start the extra session. Freshman midfielder Medina Mulic completed the Pioneer comeback with a score less than three minutes into overtime.
Although the Pioneers trailed early, they managed to outshoot their opponents, 21-7, for the match. Sophomore goalie Hillevi Eklow made four stops, earning another win for the Pioneers, her fourth of the season.
The Pioneers returned to the pitch on Saturday, Sept. 24, against Merrimack College and handed the Warriors their first shutout loss of the season and their first since 2014. The team’s 3-0 victory also improved its record to 5-2-1.
The Pioneers controlled the pace of play and dictated the action on the field, and as a result, they owned a significant advantage in scoring opportunities. By law of averages, the Pioneers 14-3 advantage in shots on goal would have to eventually pay off, and it did in the 38th minute when freshman forward Julia Duffy netted the go-ahead goal.
Two eightieth-minute goals from sophomore forward Isabella Fuduli and sophomore forward Andrea Huntzinger gave the Pioneers a decent sized cushion and sent the Pioneers on their way to yet another victory.
The Pioneers have now won three straight games and will look to continue that streak when they travel to the City of Brotherly Love on Wednesday, Oct. 5, to play Philadelphia University. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m.

Capped off with a 34-yard field goal as time expired by sophomore kicker Joey Tolgyesi, the Pioneers bested the Falcons from Bentley University, 27-24, on Saturday, Sept. 24, in front of the Pioneer faithful in Brookville, N.Y.
The game-winning kick by Tolgyesi came two minutes after the Falcons orchestrated a four-play, 80-yard drive, which ended with a 50-yard touchdown and tied the score at 24.
Rewinding to earlier in the game, it was a defensive battle early on. The first quarter saw zero points combined. The big play came in handy for both teams in the second quarter. The Pioneers struck first when senior quarterback, Jeff Kidd, connected with redshirt junior receiver, Kyle Ward, on a 40-yard touchdown to give the Pioneers a 7-0 lead. The Falcons, however, one-upped the Pioneers with a 69-yard touchdown pass just three minutes later to pull even. At the break, the score was knotted at seven. After the intermission, the Pioneers got a momentum boost when their defense made a huge play and got a safety, putting them up 9-7.
Less than three minutes before the start of the fourth quarter, redshirt senior Shane Hubbard hauled in a seven-yard touchdown from Kidd, which made the score 16-7. After another passing touchdown by the Falcons, the Pioneers saw their lead disappear when the Falcons connected on a field goal to go ahead, 17-16.
The Hubbard-Kidd connection worked well once, so why not try it again? The duo successfully gave the Pioneers the lead on a game-changing 52-yard touchdown pass, which, thanks to a two-point conversion by Kidd, gave the Pioneers a seven-point lead.
That lead was not safe though, as the Falcons tied it up but left too much time for the Pioneers to get Tolgyesi in field goal range. The 27-24 win is the Pioneers’ fourth of the season, and the team remains undefeated.
Kidd finished with 377 yards in the air, three touchdowns, and 80 yards on the ground. The halfback combination of senior David White and red-shirt sophomore Malik Pierre rushed for 77 and 58 yards, respectively. In the receiving department, Hubbard led the way with 14 catches for 167 yards and two scores, while Ward totaled seven catches for 97 yards and a touchdown.
Junior defensive back Richard Wright was all over the place, totaling six tackles and snagging an interception. Redshirt junior defensive lineman Anthony DeNunzio and redshirt senior defensive lineman Kenny Scotland also played well, each adding a sack.
The Pioneers are back in action Saturday, Oct. 1, at Worcester, Mass. to battle with Assumption College. Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

The wins keep piling up for the newly no. 2-ranked Pioneers. The women’s field hockey team topped NE-10 rival Assumption College, 3-1, on Wednesday, Sept. 21, thanks to smothering defense and timely goals from freshman midfielder Arantxa Rosainz Caloca, senior midfielder Steph Mocerino and senior forward Melissa Quintanilla.
The scoring started early as Caloca connected in the ninth minute on a bouncer that gave the Pioneers a 1-0 lead. That goal not only put the Pioneers on the board, but also put Caloca on there for the first time in her collegiate career. Mocerino got in on the action in the 28th minute with a little help from junior midfielder, Alyssa Lopresti, who set up the goal that doubled the Pioneer advantage.
The home team’s first half defense was stout, holding the Assumption Greyhounds to zero shots. Heading into the break, the Pioneers were up 2-0. The Pioneers added another tally in the second half, but also surrendered a goal. The Assumption tally however was the only blemish on a successful day for the Pioneers, who won 3-1. The Pioneers outshot their opponents, 17-3. Senior goalkeeper Ericka Parks was like a brick wall, stopping two shots and notching another victory.
Head Coach Raenee Savin and her team returned to the field on Saturday, Sept. 24, when they hit the road to face fifth-ranked Stonehill College. The top five showdown culminated in a 3-0 Pioneer victory.
The Pioneers came out of the gates hot and immediately got a scoring opportunity off a Skyhawk turnover. Sophomore forward Emily Miller went unassisted for the first tally of the day to put the Pioneers up early. The first half, which saw action early on, became a defensive battle and each side managed just two shots. At the break, the Pioneers were up 1-0.
However, in the second half the Pioneers were able to find some cracks and take advantage. Miller was again the catalyst, this time assisting Lopresti who was able to beat the keeper and give the Pioneers a two-goal advantage. Less than two minutes later, Miller struck again. Similar to her first goal, she went unassisted for the score.
The three-goal lead was safe in the hands of Parks who faced seven shots and stopped all of them in route to earning her third shutout of the season. The Pioneers now own a perfect 6-0 record and have held their opponents to less than two goals in every single match.
The Pioneers will look to keep the right side of their ledger clean when the team plays Pace University on Thursday, Sept. 29, in the first of a two-game home stand. Game-time is sched- uled for 4 p.m.

The eighth-ranked men’s soccer team, backed by three goals, topped the Knights from Bridgeport on Saturday, Sept. 24, to remain perfect on the season. The team (8-0) also improved its conference record to 2-0.
On the field, the Pioneers set the tone early and were rewarded with a strike in the 11th minute. On a corner kick, junior midfielder Harry Pearse sent the ball to the box where sophomore forward Charlie Ledula took care of the rest, putting the Pioneers on the board with a header. Pearse and Ledula weren’t done just yet.
In the second half, Ledula added to his fantastic day with another goal, widening the Pioneer advantage to two goals. Ten minutes after Ledula’s second goal, Pearse thought he’d have the same. After getting a pinpoint pass from senior forward Sean Collins, Pearse maneuvered his way forward and sent his shot to the back of the net.
The energy the Pioneers set early stayed the entirety of the match and the Pioneers owned significant advantages because of it. They outshot the Knights 36-6 and owned a 14-2 edge in corner kicks. The Pioneers’
victory is their eighth in a row and they have yet to allow more than one goal in any game this year. They have also shutout the opposition five times, including four of the last five games.
The Pioneers, led by Head Coach Andreas Lindberg, now start a five-game road trip that gets underway on Saturday, Oct. 1, against Wilmington University. Game-time is scheduled for 2:30 p.m.
