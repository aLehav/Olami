Although our beautiful and picturesque school is located in one of the wealthiest towns on Long Island, it does not mean that the students who attend Post are as wealthy as those who reside in Brookville. I wonder how everyone pays such a high sum of money for his or her education? Is it the students themselves paying for their education? Is it their parents? Scholarships? Loans?
On the men’s soccer team, who are playing extremely well at the moment by the way, well over half of the players come from another country. The majority of those international students are making the trip over the pond from Europe. I am one of these weird-looking Europeans, who wear the tight skinny jeans and have an odd accent. I am able to pay the high tuition through scholarship, which I earned through my ability to play a sport.
I am lucky to be able to experience something so great such as college, through financial aid, as well as funding from myself. Many of you may ask the question, do all athletes receive scholarships, and are they the same? The answer to this commonly asked question is no. Many athletes still have to fund some, if not all, of their education. Only about eight or nine full scholarships are given to the men’s soccer team, which has at least 14 overseas players, who made the journey over to America, and over 25 players in total on the team.
Although many Scandinavian players used to receive discounts to come to Post because the university had a ‘Scandinavian relationship’ with certain schools and companies, in the past two years this discount has been terminated. Any financial aid that a student from Sweden or Norway would have received in the past has now been halted, which means they have to find a vast amount of money for their tuition. Post offers many opportunities to get financial aid, through good grades, athletics, or excellence. This aid is where most students receive help when it comes to paying for their college education.
A lot of students at Post receive tremendous help from their parents, which is completely understandable. Who at 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 or even 23, is going to be able to play $50,000 a year for four years? Unless he or she is the Prince of England, (I do only share the same name as Prince Harry of Great Britain…), surely this is the only way to pay for such an outrageous amount.
In England, the tuition is £12,000, which is a ridiculous amount, and it’s rising. But compared to the outrageous sum that universities in the United States charge, it seems very little. I am very sympathetic with American college students who don’t receive any financial aid, and therefore have to shell out ridiculous amounts of money to further their education. However, maybe some students could work harder to just contribute to their time at college, and their party animal lifestyles?
I’m not saying you have to get a job as the CEO of Apple and earn millions a year, but maybe work at a café in your free time, maybe a job on campus, or a paid internship? Anything that pays just a small amount, so that instead of your parents paying your tuition, books, petrol, car, drinks, food and everything else that they pay for, maybe you could get it yourself. Instead of putting the tequila shots on your daddy’s American Express card, you pay for them with the cash you worked so hard for?
Try and think about how you pay for your tuition…this is a lot of money that you or mainly your parents are shelling out. We need to be smart! If you feel like you are living off all of your parents’ money, then try and help out! Although you have sacrificed working full time to better yourself with academia, you still need to be motivated about paying your tuition!

“Star Wars,” “X-Files,” “Heroes,” “Jurassic Park,” “Mad Max,” — even the return of old Nickelodeon shows with its new, anticipated channel, “The Splat.” One could wonder, what exactly does it mean? Are we genuinely attempting to revive and reinvent the golden, ‘blockbuster age of media’, or is the media itself simply aiming to tug on our heartstrings of nostalgia for a quick buck?
According to Don Steinberg’s Wallstreet Journal article, entitled, “Hollywood Digs Into Archives to Revive Old Franchises” (April, 23), Steinberg dives into his thoughts on the subject. “It would be romanticizing the business to chalk it all up to nostalgia, to suggest that 1980s kids grew up to run studios and now decide what movies to release based on their childhood memories. Studios own franchises and are always looking to monetize them.”
If this is the case, why now? Is there something special about this current time we live in that allows for old franchises to still hold such prominence in our daily lives, or is it something related to the concept of nostalgia in itself?
According to John Tierney’s New York Times article, entitled, “What Is Nostalgia For? Quite a Bit, Research Shows,” (July 8, 2013), nostalgia can be integral and can make us feel more ‘complete.’
“Nostalgia makes us a bit more human,” says Dr. Constantine Sedikides, who previously encountered strange feelings of nostalgia when having lunch with a former colleague.
“Nostalgia has been shown to counteract loneliness, boredom, and anxiety,” Sedikides said. “It makes people more generous to strangers and more tolerant of outsiders. Couples feel closer and look happier when they’re sharing nostalgic memories. On cold days, or in cold rooms, people use nostalgia to literally feel warmer.”
What do students think about nostalgia and its hinted connection to the old franchise names that we know and love?
For Cara Grogilo, a senior art education major, nostalgia plays a very important role in her life. “Nostalgia has affected me greatly in terms of what I watch,” she said. “For example, when ‘Dragon Ball Z: Battle Of Gods’ came out in theaters, my boyfriend and I got those tickets in advance. ‘Dragon Ball Z’ was a popular anime on Toonami in the ‘90s – early 2000s. Grogilo thinks it is really smart from the media industry to capitalize on nostalgia, which she believes is exactly where they are going.
Meanwhile, Eric Goodmark, a senior electronic media major, said that nostalgia has affected him, but not really at an emotional stage. “I mean, when there is something form back in the day that I really like, I’ll be passionate on my fondness for it,” Goodmark said. “But not in a way where I’ll start tearing up or anything.”
In a general state of mind, Goodmark believes that the concept of nostalgia is intriguing. “No matter how much I loved a series back in the day, going back to it now, I can still look at it critically, and remember it was because nostalgia was making it seem better than it actually was,” he
said. Personally, I definitely agree with the concept that feelings of nostalgia drive out our emotions of thrill and excitement when hearing about an old franchise making a return to the big screen. I think that many factors are involved with the process, but above all, it makes us think about our childhood, and what we used to be connected to in a positive way, and in my opinion, that’s a very healthy thing. I love feeling nostalgia and similar feelings to it, because it provokes emotions that make me feel ‘warm’ inside, and overall, excited and ready for what may come my way — in this case, media-wise.

On Tuesday Oct. 27, the Honors College held its annual Halloween party, including the Department of Philosophy, and the Department of English, along with all students involved in these majors, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.
Dr. Joan Digby, Director of the Honors Program and Professor of English, facilitated the party, along with the help of other faculty in the Winnick House. The afternoon was meant to “bring together the three academic groups that are up on the second floor of Winnick,” Digby said.
Several professors participated in the spirit of the Halloween party, such as Dr. Glenn Magee, the Department of Philosophy Chairman and Professor of Philosophy, who decided to dress like a Viking. Digby also dressed up; she wore a fox mask.
“I wore it because I was teaching a piece about a fox hunt in my class the horse and literature,” she said. “In fact I actually planned this months ago and bought the mask knowing I could get them to read this story for this particular day for the Halloween party.” Several members of faculty participated in the festivities.
“I think it’s a great morale booster to spend time to have something to eat and drink cider together,” Digby said. It was a social gathering that allowed students to interact with their professors, where they were able to discuss more than just a class lesson. Ilana Leviton, a freshman psychology major, agreed. “It was a lot of fun. We met a lot of people, [the costumes] were hilarious.”
Leviton participated in dressing up for the party, attempting to look beatnik, a young person from the ‘50s and ‘60s belonging to the beat generation. “But I ended up wearing Whovian apparel,” she said. “It was interactive, we were on the same level when it came to anything [with professors], it was very relaxed.”
Ari Kunofsky, a sophomore childhood education major, also participated in the festivities; however, she felt that the setting didn’t matter regarding the person environment with her professors. “That’s just kind of normal to me.”
Throughout the party, students have filtered in an out of the Great Hall, due to their class schedule. The time frame made it difficult for several students to attend. Digby understood that students have their own classes to worry about, and was pleased that students still took the time out of their day to stop by.
Digby also enjoyed that students participated in some of the classic Halloween events that were set up for the party. “In the beginning of the party, we put out apples to do dunking, and at first only one girl wanted to try it. But by the time we finished, three or four people ended up doing it,” Digby said. “I think everyone wants a break to sit a moment and drink some cider.”

Nick Tangorra, a freshman Public Relations major, has been grabbing the attention of other students. He has also been attracting attention from people all over the country. Tangorra started posting videos of him singing on YouTube about four years ago, when he was 14. In 2013, Tangorra was also a finalist on “America’s Got Talent.”
The videos he posts are usually covers of popular songs, with a few of his own songs, and often feature his older brother, LIU Post alumnus, Raphe Tangorra, on the drums.
“I think ultimately what inspired me to get so involved with music is my passion. Ever since I was a little kid I’ve just loved music,” Tangorra said. “My grandfather passed away when I was young and we were going through some of his stuff; we found records of him performing from back in his day. Ever since I’ve loved music and feel like I’m connecting with my grandfather every time I get on stage.”
Being a finalist on “America’s Got Talent” is a huge accomplishment for anyone, but to Tangorra, his biggest accomplishments are not about titles and competition. “I think my proudest accomplishment so far would be how successful our EP did on the charts, landing in the Top 20, and also getting to perform at Nikon Jones Beach Theat,” Tangorra said. “I’ve been going to shows there my all of my life, so for people to be there to see me was just absolutely mind blowing.”
While Tangorra has already accomplished so much, he still has big dreams. “I would love to tour with Bruno Mars,” he said. “His music is incredible and style is remarkable.” Tangorra also states that he would also love to tour with Amy Winehouse. “But I don’t think that’s possible,” he said jokingly. “At least not until they make her hologram.” Aside from who he would like to tour with, Tangorra says his biggest goal is “to be heard, but most importantly to be true to myself and my craft.”
“At first I didn’t know who Nick was until I saw him perform at the Columbus Day Parade and recognized him from around campus,” said Ariana Franz, a freshman vocal music education major. “To fellow music majors and music lovers, it shows that a music career isn’t just a dream, it’s a reachable reality. I fully support and admire his determination.”
As a young singer, with a bright career standing in front of him, you would imagine Tangorra would be studying music at Post. But Tangorra is currently enrolled in the Public Relations program. “I really am fascinated with how it all works in relation to advertising, social medias, and a celebrity’s/company’s relationship with their fans,” he said.
As for Tangorra’s plans after college, he said, “Keep doing what I’m doing! Music is forever!” Tangorra said. “I’d also like to get married and start a family. That’d be nice too.”

College can be difficult; tests, papers, long days and all-nighters add up and can put immense stress on students. Sometimes, all we need is a little break. Perhaps, we need a vacation.
There are many destinations that attract students looking to go on a trip. During an informal survey of 20 students, all said they would rather visit a tropical destination for a vacation rather than a cold one. Some students spoke about their desire to lie on a beach with a coconut drink in their hand.
One popular vacation spot for this kind of relaxation during any season is Florida. Almost any part of the sunny state is popular for a short or long getaway; however, many college students enjoy South Florida specifically.
“I went to West Palm Beach during my sophomore year, and it was the perfect way to relieve stress from school,” said Cody Petit, a senior musical theater major. “Going away with friends from school, but not having to deal with school work was awesome. We stayed at a friend’s condo which was conveniently right on the beach.” Florida has numerous attractions, ranging from Disney World in Orlando, to the nightlife in Miami.
Olivia Platania, a senior dance major, is attracted to destinations that have a lot of sunshine. “I visited both California and Vegas this past year,” Platania said. “They were for completely different reasons but both were great experiences.” Platania visited Las Vegas for a family vacation and California for a dance program, outside of school, in Los Angeles. “The West Coast is completely different than the East Coast,” she said. “There were mountains everywhere I looked, it was such a relaxing environment.”
Although the cold weather does not appeal to certain people, for those who enjoy bundling up, there are certain destinations to vacation that involve the cold. A few years back, my family visited a resort in Harmony, P.A., the complete opposite of a sun kissed resort, but loads of fun nonetheless. It was called Split Rock Resort.
Split Rock is popular when there’s snow on the ground, due to the winter activities the resort advertises, such as tubing and skiing. The resort also has a bowling alley and movie theater attached to it, with an indoor pool and shuffleboard courts as well. It’s an awesome place to go with adults and kids of all ages.
Winter break is approaching quickly, Dec. 23-Jan. 19, so start planning your vacations now!

Over the last several years, television creators have been adopting the anthology format when creating new shows. Each season of an anthology show tells a complete story, which allows for new characters to step in and have a new story set in a different location or time period. This trend began with “American Horror Story” on FX five years ago and has continued with HBO’s “True Detective,” and fellow FX show “Fargo.”
Anthologies are a very unique type of show that allows the creator to tell a different story every season and employ talented actors who would otherwise not have time to appear on multiple season shows. Senior film major Amaury Narvaez believes anthology shows are a good addition in television.
“I like them,” Narvaez said. “Compared to a series running over multiple seasons, it can be refreshing to get a new story and new characters every year.” While anthology shows can have some drawbacks if the story is not particularly interesting, Narvaez feels that the trend is good for television. “Overall anthologies can be awesome, especially when you don’t want or have the time to invest in multiple season stories.”
“American Horror Story” was the first anthology show to start this trend. In AHS, every season takes place around a different clichéd horror location or group, like a haunted hospital or group of witches. The show is currently airing its fifth season and has included a haunted house, insane asylum, witch coven, freak show, and now a hotel.
The show has also had well known actors and actresses such as Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Wes Bentley, and Lady Gaga.
In “True Detective,” each season revolves around a crime case and the detectives assigned to solve it. Season one took place in Louisiana over the course of 17 years, as Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson attempted to catch a serial killer. The season was extremely well received and was nominated for several Emmys.
The recently wrapped second season, starred Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, and Vince Vaughn. Instead of Louisiana, the action moved to Los Angeles and centered around a murdered businessman. Detectives from three separate departments attempted to solve the case.
The latest anthology show is “Fargo” and each season revolves around a different crime case set around Minnesota. The first season took place in 2006 and revolved around the arrival of a drifter named Lorne Malvo in a small town in Minnesota, in addition to the impact he had on the community. The cast for season one included Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Allison Tolman, and Colin Hanks.
Season two is actually a prequel to season one, taking place in the 1970s. This season focuses on Lou Solverson, who is the father of Allison Tolman’s character, Molly Solverson, from season one. This season features Partick Wilson, Ted Danson, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, and Jean Smart. Season two focuses on the cover-up of a hit-and-run murder, and the investigation of a massacre that occurred in a diner.
As each new fall season approaches, it seems like more anthology shows are premiering. Some new anthology shows this season include “Scream Queens” and “American Crime Story.” “Scream Queens” airs new episodes Tuesday nights at
9 p.m. on FOX, while “American Crime Story” premieres early 2016 on FX.

Every fall, summer and spring, the Steinberg Museum in Hillwood Commons usually have a rapidly changing exhibition, but for the last exhibition of the fall, museum director Barbara Applegate wanted to try something new. “We’re having this one up through March 25,” she said.
The new approach includes events and activities for students, and is also open to the public. On Thursday, Nov. 5, there will be a hands on drawing lecture outside, to learn about the new exhibition, which opens on Wednesday. There will also be guest lectures from renowned historians, outside speakers, and hands on events.
The exhibition itself is called “L’Amour du Beau,” “Love of Beauty,” and features 19th century French paintings and drawings. “The artworks are neither romanticism or impressionism,” Applegate said. “They’re kind of a mix between the two.” The exhibition features 67 works from 42 artists, including Antoine Vollon. The collection comes from Carol Tabler.
Tabler, a Long Island native, who also curated the exhibit, is an art historian who specializes in the French 19th century movement. “She could pick up any of the pieces you see here and write a paper on it,” said of the collector, calling her one of the most foremost historians in her field.
The way the exhibition is set up is very categorical. It has landscapes in one area, still lives in another, but Applegate says it follows a “stream of consciousness.” The pieces are paired with quotes from the artists themselves on the wall to follow with the consciousness theme.
“It tells exactly what the artist said,” Applegate said, explaining how even though the exhibit is very classical compared to what they usually feature, it has to appeal to her audience. “This is a very academically heavy show, and the art is very serious,”she said. The quotes, she hopes will help students and museumgoers understand a bit more what lies behind the canvas.
The exhibition is open from Wednesday, Nov. 4 through March 25, 2016. Museum hours are:
Monday – Friday 9:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. Wednesdays 9:30 a.m. – 8 p.m. Saturdays 11 a.m. – 3 p.m.
There will be an opening reception at a later, undecided date.

At least with my friends, watching horrible movies is a bit of a tradition. The Halloween season provides the perfect context to sit back, browse Netflix and find a classic like “Gingerdead Man,” “Troll 2,” “Leprechaun 5: in the Hood” or the infamous “Plan 9 From Outer Space.” But what is appealing about a bad movie? We don’t watch them for their gripping stories. We don’t watch them for their amazing special effects. We don’t watch them because they’ve got good ratings.
We watch bad movies because they don’t challenge us like other films do. Take a heady film like “Interstellar” or “Requiem for a Dream,” you can’t simply watch them with a group of friends, unless your friends are cats who don’t talk at all. The attention span of the viewer casually watching a movie with friends is short. We are prone to distractions, we love to talk, and so we welcome bad movies that provide zero substance and all (bad) thrills. These types of films rarely have statement to say, relying instead on the pure entertainment of genre tropes.
We watch bad movies because in world of high-tech CGI and overproduced blockbusters, sometimes it’s nice to see a laughable attempt at special effects. Take the original “Evil Dead” films from the 1980s. The creative use of clay animation in the film may seem oddly outdated now, but the viewer has to appreciate the tedious effort involved in making them — stop motion, prosthetics, wax and fake blood intermingling to create creatures and gore. A use of practical effects has become signature to low-budget B horror films, and the effects are one of the qualities that so endear the viewers.
We watch bad movies because they’re funny. When all of the elements of filmmaking fail, when a drop in quality from the norm is apparent, humor can be derived from the experience. Relinquishing all expec- tations of quality, the viewer can allow him or herself to purely enjoy a bad movie for the communal aspects involved. Bad movies bring people together.

On Wednesday, Oct. 28, the poetry club on campus known as S.N.A.P.P.S., held their third event this semester. It was an open mic in which the students had the chance to come a read their own poetry or poems by other poets.
“Since the event was Halloween themed it was suggested that participants read spooky poems,” said Richard Renelique, a senior Broadcasting major, who is also president of the club. “But it’s a general open mic so the work isn’t restricted to just that, it can be about anything. We also welcome fiction and comedy as well.”
The event was one of many this semester. “We had an open mic at the beginning of the semester and we coordinated with a bunch of other club on the Hispanic heritage month event,” said Renelique.
“All of these past events have gathered a very large and diverse crowd, about 15 to 20 people,” said Renelique. “For this particular event there were a little less but there were some issues with putting up a flyer and advertising.”
During the event, Renelique read his own poem titled “Waves.” “The inspiration behind that poem is that I am constantly surrounded by sound, hence the term waves because of audio waves,” said Renelique. “And how I prefer to be a more introverted and quiet individual but that doesn’t always agree with societies standards,” he added.
Ilana Leviton, a freshman psychology major, who is a member of S.N.A.P.P.S, attended the event and participated as well. “I didn’t prepare anything in particular for it but I was in the mood to write some thrills and chills and some scary poems so I sort of went with that,” she said
When writing, Leviton used a little bit of Edgar Allen Poe and James Patterson for inspiration. “Event’s like these are awesome cause they allow us to express ourselves,” said Leviton. “I think expression is the best thing and people can find it in writing, in acting, in whatever they do.”
Leviton finds her expression mostly in writing “Writing is a great form of expression it strengthens your personality expressing who you are, because that’s where it starts connecting your mind to the paper basically,” she said.
During the first open mic they had this semester some people that weren’t even part of the club read poetry about things like the economy and or politics, Leviton recalls. “It was bizarre but awesome to see, people can express themselves in many different ways,” she said.
Club member Alexis Watkins, a senior in Forensic Science major, loves that poetry gives her freedom. “Science is really restrictive but with writing there really isn’t no wrong or right, and I like that,” she said.
One of the things that Watkins really likes about being a part of S.N.A.P.P.S. and attending events like these is how open they are to different types of expressions. “I love that we not only just do poetry and/ or writing short stories,” Watkins said. “If you have any songs you want to sing, or even today we saw a comedian. Just any form of expression is pretty much acceptable or wanted at our events.”
Other than open mics, Renelique said that the club holds workshops that allow students to sit down and write. They also organize trips to poetry cafes in the city every semester. The club has nine members and most of the members write their own poems. S.N.A.P.P.S. meets every Wednesdays in the Honors Lounge from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

The men’s basketball team was voted to finish third in the East Coast Conference for the 2015-16 season, according to a poll done in the league office last week. The team finished behind the University of Bridgeport, who are the reigning conference champions, and St. Thomas Aquinas College.
The Pioneers are returning two starters from last year’s campaign; senior guard Dillon Burns and junior forward Greg Dotson. Burns averaged 6.6 points per game while leading the conference in assists, and Dotson averaged 11.3 per game and was top five in the ECC in field-goal percentage and blocked shots.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and his squad open up the regular season on Saturday, Nov. 14, against the University of the Sciences. Tip-off from Delaware is set for 1 p.m.

After an overtime loss at the hands of no. 1 ranked Bentley University, the Pioneers were back in action on Friday, Oct. 30, in their regular season wrap-up against Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire.
Their matchup featured three total goals, two of them coming from Franklin Pierce, giving them the 2-1 win. The hosts got on the board first with a tally late in the second half. LIU responded with a goal a little while later from freshman forward Emily Miller. With the equalizing goal, the Pioneers were set to play their fifth overtime game of the season. In the extra session, junior midfielder Kenady Kelly gave her squad the victory with her second goal of the match.

Armed with four stud-starting pitchers, the Mets had every reason to believe they would raise a third championship banner in 2015. As a great baseball mind once said, “Offense gets you to the playoffs, pitching wins you playoff games.”
The Mets rolled over the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS, swept them in four games, and made their first World Series appearance since 2000. Their opponent, the Kansas City Royals, were in their second straight Fall Classic and determined to bring a championship one year after losing in game seven.
Matt Harvey got the ball in game one and held the Royals in check for the most part, but the story of the Royals season has been ‘not giving up until the final out.’ With the lead in the ninth inning, the Mets turned the ball over to perennial all-star closer Jeurys Familia, and he served up a game-tying homer to Alex Gordon. In extras, the Royals won on a sacrifice fly. A game, seemingly in the Mets’ hands, but snatched away by the Royals. After the Royals took care of arguably New York’s best pitcher, Jacob deGrom, they took a commanding 2-0 lead in the series to New York.
Game three turned the series around for a short time. Citi Field was rocking and the Mets offense came to life. The Mets captain, David Wright, set the tone with a two-run bomb in the first inning, and the boys from Queens never looked back. The Mets took game three handily and looked to even the series the next night.
With the lead late in game four, the Mets bullpen, which was one of the weaknesses of the team, showed its ugly head. Aided by a defensive error by NLCS MVP Daniel Murphy, the Royals scored three runs in the eighth inning, and took control of the series. Game four showed where the Mets had holes in their team and the Royals took advantage of those holes.
Matt Harvey, the Dark Knight, got the ball again in game five, and he was on fire. He allowed no runs through eight innings and was single-handedly putting the team on his back. After a decision that will get second-guessed by many fans by Terry Collins to leave Harvey in the game, the Royals showed their resiliency. Down two runs and with three outs to go, Eric Hosmer doubled home a run and then made the biggest play of the series. Hosmer broke for home on a grounder to Wright and the throw from Lucas Duda airmailed the catcher.
A few innings later, the Royals showed their championship heart and put up a five spot in the 12th inning. The last out by closer Wade Davis was just a formality as the Royals won the series four games to one, and ended a 30-year title drought.
The Mets season was one of the most interesting of recent memory. They were hot in the beginning, awful in the dog days of summer, then a couple of trades later and this team wound up in the World Series. There are decisions to be made in the offseason, like: do they resign Murphy and Yoenis Cespedes? But one thing is for sure: if you didn’t think this team was for real, think again.

After defeating Molloy College one week ago by a score of 5-2, the no. 10 ranked men’s soccer team returned to the field on Saturday, Oct. 31, when they played in their regular season finale against St. Thomas Aquinas College. After a quick strike by St. Thomas, the Pioneers re- sponded with not one, but two goals from sophomore midfielder Harry Pearse. Junior forward Jason Lampkin was on the passing end of both of those goals.
After a tying goal by St. Thomas and an intermission break, the Pioneers took the lead when senior forward Per Forgaard found the back of the net off a pass from none other than Lampkin. The hosts did not fold under the pressure though, as they scored two times, less than a minute in between, to steal a victory from the Green and Gold.
Andreas Lindberg and his team are now prepared for the 2015 East Coast Conference Championships, which begin on Wednesday, Nov. 4.

After giving up 22 unanswered points in the fourth quarter, the football team (6-3) held on and defeated Northeast-10 opponent, Southern Connecticut State University (3-6), 49-46 on Senior Day at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium.
With just 16 seconds remaining in the contest, junior quarterback Jeff Kidd put the game in the books with a first-down pass to red-shirt sophomore wide receiver James Higgins on a crucial fourth-and-three.
The game was highlighted by Kidd’s season-high six touchdown passes as the LIU offense proved to be unstoppable throughout the first three quarters. Two snaps into the second period, Kidd delivered a 19- yard touchdown pass to red-shirt sophomore wide-out Kyle Ward, put- ting the hosts in front, 14-7.
On the following drive, junior running back David White dashed for 23 yards into Owls territory, before a personal foul on the defense put the Pioneers in the red-zone. The next play resulted in a 13-yard touch- down as Kidd found senior tight end Sean Binckes, giving the Pioneers a 21-7 advantage.
LIU’s onslaught continued for the third straight series as Kidd rifled a bullet to Higgins, which set up shop at the Owls’ 37-yard line. He then hoisted a 37-yard bomb, which was hauled in by red-shirt junior wide-out Shane Hubbard for the score. Kidd threw three touchdowns in a span of 4:28, giving the Green and Gold a commanding 28-7 lead.
Southern Connecticut tacked on a field goal, but the Oregon- native kept on rolling as he scrambled for 41 yards down to the Owls 23- yard line. Three plays later, Kidd found Ward up the seam for an 18-yard touchdown in the back of the end zone to put LIU ahead 35-10 heading into the locker room.
In the latter stanza, the visitors marched down the field and scored a touchdown on their opening possession. However, the Pioneers kept airing it out as Kidd perfectly placed a 13-yard touchdown strike
to Hubbard, scoring his second touchdown of the game. The Pioneers jumped out to a 42-17 lead, but the defense started to lose its footing when Owls quarterback Robert Nittolo threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to junior receiver Devante Jenkins, making it a 42-24 game.
As the third quarter came to a close, Kidd continued to throw for big chunks of yardage, hooking up with Binckes and then red-shirt junior running back Mike Williams giving the Pioneers a first and goal from the Owls 2-yard line. On the next play, Kidd would find Williams again on an out route for a two-yard score to close out the third quarter.
A fourth quarter, which was filled with injuries and miscues, nearly cost the Green and Gold the game. The Owls scored three touchdowns in the final period putting the crowd on the edge of their seats. After Jenkins scored his second touchdown of the game for the visitors, the Pioneers turned the ball over as Higgins coughed up the football. The visitors capitalized when senior running back Robert Thomas scampered into the end zone from three yards out, bringing the Owls within 11 at the 7:52 mark.
In addition to red-shirt senior linebacker Brandon Cheney missing his third straight game, the Pioneers lost junior safety Clarence Sears in the third quarter due to injury, leaving them thin in the secondary. With Sears sidelined, the guests continued to gain momentum as they got the ball back and scored with 3:35 remaining, cutting LIU’s lead down to three following a two-point conversion. On the ensuing kickoff, red-shirt sophomore defensive back Mike Gregorovic recovered a squib kick to give LIU possession. From that point on, the Pioneers were able to chew down the clock and escape with a 49-46 victory.
Kidd completed 19-of-27 passing for 282 yards and a season- best six touchdowns. In addition to Kidd’s outstanding performance, the Pioneers rushed for 260 yards and racked up 542 yards of total offense. White ran for a career-high 185 yards on 26 carries. Kidd also showed his mobility on the ground with six carries for 58 yards. Binckes had four catches for 67 yards and one touchdown. Williams served as a nice check-down option out of the backfield, making four receptions for 58 yards and one score. Ward and Higgins each caught four balls for 48 yards.
Defensively, the Pioneers missed the presence of Cheney and Sears late in the game, but did enough to secure the win. Junior line- backer Nate Feliz led the defense with a career-high 14 tackles. Red-shirt junior defensive lineman Kenny Scotland and sophomore defensive lineman Kevin Petit-Frere were fierce off the edges, each recording two sacks. Scotland led the squad with four quarterback hurries while Feliz and Petit-Frere each had two.
Head Coach Bryan Collins and the Pioneers will wrap up the 2015 regular season Saturday, Nov. 7, when they take on Northeast-10 rival Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

Powered by a two-goal performance from freshman forward Andrea Huntzinger, the Pioneers cruised to a 5-0 win against Molloy College last Wednesday. The Pioneers looked to carry that momentum into their matchup on Saturday, Oct. 31, against St. Thomas Aquinas College, and did they ever.
The Pioneers blanked the opposition and won by a score of 3-0 in their regular season finale. Propelled by two goals in the first half from junior forward Julia Backman, the Pioneers never looked back. They held St. Thomas to just two shots in the first half and were able to put the cherry on top when senior forward Susanne Vistnes continued her incredible season and scored a header to put LIU up 3-0.
The Pioneers and Head Coach Mark Dawson now sit back and await the seedings for the East Coast Conference Championships, which get underway on Thursday, Nov. 5.

For fall 2015, 60 new students have joined the Honors College, which is more than double the number of students who enrolled last year. Many of these new students come from the immediate area, as well as other states and countries. The Honors College was created this fall from the former honors program to provide students a heightened level of education, and an experience that is beneficial to continuing future education, and a professional career. Last fall semester, 29 students enrolled in the honors program.
Athletics brought many students into the Honors College. Golf and tennis have drawn students from other states. Of the students coming from North Carolina and South Carolina, one student is coming to play golf and the other to be on the tennis team. The equestrian team has drawn some students in as well. “One of the girls on the equestrian team has come with her horse from Canada,” said Dr. Joan Digby, the Director of the Honors College and Professor of English.
A large portion of the Honors College is made up of students majoring in musical theater. In Digby’s freshman English class alone, five students are musical theater majors. Post’s theater company attracts many of these students by recruiting at events all over the country. The students who make up the Honors College come from many different backgrounds and cover a broad range of majors such as business, art therapy, the fine arts, biology and many more. The diversity makes for a “richer, deeper, [and] a more cultural experience,” said Digby.
Tracey Christy, assistant to the director of the Honors college, said, “since we were transitioning from an honors program to an Honors College, we wanted to have a nice enrollment for that.” Honors students are required to take honors level courses, giving them a deeper insight into a broad range of subjects. Honors courses usually have smaller class sizes.
Hannah Fitch, senior arts management major who is enrolled in the Honors college, said “smaller class sizes allow you to talk to your professors more individually.” Fitch explained that she got to know Professor Barbara Applegate, who later became her thesis advisor, because of her classroom setting. Being a student in the Honors College is also beneficial in helping prepare students who plan on going to graduate school.
Digby is pleased with the increased enrollment in the college this year. “The more students we have, the more courses we can offer, and greater variety we can put together,” she said. One of the most important aspects of the Honors College is to gain knowledge, and to become educated in areas outside of your major. A larger variety of courses will provide more opportunities to study different subjects, and improve the Honors College overall.
The Honors College is not closed off to students who haven’t enrolled yet. Students who enrolled at LIU Post as freshman are able to join the Honors College until their junior year. Christy explained, “I know a lot of [students] have put entering the Honors College on hold,” since they are concerned about transitioning into college and other factors. They are able to enroll in subsequent years, by filling out an application available on liu.edu.
“My biggest goal now would be to have our Honors College considered one of the best honors colleges to attend in the country, and I think that is a reasonable goal and I think we achieve that,” Digby said.

On Nov. 7-8, Post the School of Continuing Education will be offering an opportunity to improve students’ marketability and process management skills through a Lean Six Sigma certification course.
The course is open to the public, at $450 per person. There is not a final registration date, however, registration before Nov. 4 will guarantee you a seat. This course is being offered by The School of Continuing Education in conjunction with Six Sigma US, which is a global organization.
The ball began to move on this offering when Brian Gali, a professor in the computer science department, became a full-time professor and met with Robert Valli, Dean of the College of Management. They have a mutual interest in bringing workshops to Post.
“Six Sigma is a continuous improvement methodology that focuses on reducing variations and creating more standardization surrounding processes,” Galli said.
Six Sigma is about making a process as efficient as can be. This can be applied to manufacturing like an assembly line, or the order in which you do things to come to school in the morning, on a personal level. Six Sigma specifically focuses on finding possible deviations, and eliminating them. There is also a variant to Six Sigma that is called Lean Six Sigma, which has a lot of the same terminology, but focuses on wasted time.
The two-day course will be a Yellow Belt certification in Lean Six Sigma, which is a combination of the certifications. A yellow belt is still at a relatively introductory level belt. The certifications begins with a white belt, and once a student improves then the student receives yellow belt, following with a green belt, to a black belt, and finally to a masters black belt. For the course, Galli has planned a simulated project where students will, “reduce variation in the Six Sigma world and then reduce the waste from the Sigma world.”
This course will introduce students to some of the tools and terminology used by Six Sigma. During the first few hours of day one, students will get an overview of Lean, and Six Sigma. After lunch, all of the time left will be spent on the Six Sigma tools, such as cause and effect diagraming, process mapping, and FMEA’s which was created within a spreadsheet, to help anticipate what might go wrong during the process. The following day will be spent on the Lean tools, such as spaghetti diagrams, which is a chart that displays product flow.
Galli, who has taught this course before at Stony Brook University, is predicting a 90 percent course success rate, based on his past experience teaching the course. Although Galli has not decided, he is considering giving a final assessment at the end of the course.
Although the price might seem steep, Galli believes it is well worth it. He said, “It helps make students more marketable, employers are looking for students who have the ability to think critically beyond what they learn in textbooks.” He added, “These are skill sets that not only will help you professionally, but personally.”
For example, one of the exercises he has planned will test this: early in the day students will be timed while they assemble five Lego cars following a specific set of instructions. After they are taught some of the tools, the same exercise will be done, but they will be allowed to build the cars the way they want. From Galli’s past experience, the second trial is usually faster.
This course is made up of students from LIU Post, LIU Brooklyn, and NYIT. Because this is the first time the course has been offered, the rate will remain the same but that is subject to change. The price is a combination of the royalties that Post has to pay to Six Sigma U.S. for the actual course materials, the annual licensing fee, and catered food.
There are currently less than 20 students registered, but Galli believes the final number will be in the mid-twenties. Galli has already had to change the location once to accommodate all of the students. Currently, the course will be held on one of the top floors in the library.
Students can pay with a check, in cash, or check or by credit card. It will be possible for students to pay in increments; however, the course must be fully paid for by the day of the course.
