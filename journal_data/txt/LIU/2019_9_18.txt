Long Island University
welcomes a new athletic director, Dr. William Martinov. At the end of July
2019, President Kimberly Cline announced Martinov as the University’s athletic
director after the previous Athletic Director Debby DeJong accepted a position
at Stony Brook University. Martinov will serve as the athletic director for both
Brooklyn and Post’s campuses as they begin their first year as a combined
Division I program. 
Martinov is thrilled to have the
opportunity to be named the athletic director during this historic time for LIU
athletics. “I am so excited and humbled to be working at LIU and be the
athletic director. LIU has so many great things going on and to be here in it’s
transition is amazing,” he said.
Martinov has already
shown to student athletes, coaches, and administrators his commitment and
dedication to success for the LIU athletics program. He held meetings with
athletes and coaches from both Brooklyn and Post’s campus to make clear what
his agenda and expectations are for the athletic programs here at LIU. Martinov
has explained vision and hopes for LIU athletics in three parts. “First, we
want to graduate student athletes. Next, we want to build the entire person
through athletics and third, is to win. If we as one program can focus on those
three things than we will win,” he said.
When introducing
Martinov as the Shark’s athletic director for the first time, Cline
commented on how the new director will positively affect LIU athletics. “Bill’s student-centered career, in developing
successful athletic programs and student academic services, will help lead LIU into
a new era of championship athletics,” she said.
Martinov is no stranger
to a championship mentality. After graduating from Indiana’s DePauw University,
Martinov began his career at the University of Notre Dame as the assistant
strength and conditioning coach for over 10 years
from 1987 to 1998. There, Martinov was a part of the coaching staff of the 1988
National Championship team with Notre Dame Football. He hopes to bring
this mindset and intensity of champions to LIU. “Notre Dame is a special place.
There was a culture of success there I was lucky enough to experience. And I
hope I can bring these experiences with me as my job as a leader here at LIU,”
Martinov said.
Martinov’s has over 30
years of experience in both higher education and athletics. He
has coached, worked with and overseen players that have become collegiate
all-Americans and professional athletes in the NBA, MLB, and NFL. “Any coach
wants to see their players go on and do great things. When they do, you feel a
little part of their success and are so proud of these players,” he said.
            Before
coming to LIU, Martinov
was involved in both student affairs and athletics at Mercy College. Prior to
Mercy College, Martinov served as the senior
associate director of athletics at Stony Brook University. 
            Long
Island University is not Martinov’s first job as director of athletics. Prior
to accepting the position at Stony Brook, he was the athletic director at SUNY
Maritime College for four years.
            Martinov
started his first job as an executive
in athletics in 1998 at St. John’s University. He started off as director of
equipment operations and strength and conditioning and then moved his way up to
becoming associate director of alumni relations for the duration of his career
at St. Johns. There, he earned his doctoral
degree in educational administration. 
            Martinov
is no stranger to either one of LIU’s campuses. He came to LIU in 2016 to work
first as chief of admissions and enrollment strategy and then as dean of
eastern regional campuses and chief of alumni and employer engagement. His
experience during this time as part of the campus’ athletic department prepared him for the position of athletic director.

 The women’s soccer team faced New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) at President’s Stadium at NYIT on Friday, Sept. 13. The highly competitive game resulted in a 1-1 tie after double overtime. Freshman forward Tatiana Lizarraga scored an early goal against the Highlanders off a deflection from the post two minutes into the game. The rest of the half was a consistent back-and-forth game from both sides. 
Each competitor had many opportunities on goal, but both teams were unable to find the back of the net. Opponent Tara Walenczyk tied the game 11 minutes into the second half due to miscommunication between The Shark’s defensive line. The remaining time was filled with both teams attacking towards goal, but the score remained a 1-1 tie after 110 minutes of play.
Freshman defender Grace Cagnina and senior midfielder Gabrielle Clark explained the final score of Friday’s game was just a case of bad luck. They thought they had a lot more chances to score in comparison to previous games. They both believe their team took the initiative to control the game through their movement of the ball. Clark believes it’s only a matter of time before her team is able to prove their worth.
Both players expressed frustration about the conditions of their practice and game field. Friday’s game was originally supposed to be their first home game, but they were unable to host the game due to the bad conditions of their field. Clark and Cagnina said the thick and bumpy grass made it difficult for them to prepare themselves against teams who have perfect clean-cut grass or even turf fields. 
They believe it was unfair that they were unable to properly train as their opponents are. Assistant Director of Athletics and Director of Media Relations Casey Schermick did not know the exact cause of the moved game or the conditions of the field, but says safety and grass quality could be determining factors. “I do know that the grass was spotty at parts of the field and caused concern for bouncing balls and the safety of players,” he said. “This could be caused by a number of different factors, including weather patterns, diseases and weeds in the grass, etc.”  The Pioneer was not able to reach the director of facilities services in time for an interview regarding the fields.
After letting the game field rest for another two days, the women’s soccer team was welcomed to play their first home game on Sunday Sept. 15, against University of the Pacific. The game ended with a narrow 0-1 loss. 
Cagnina and Clark both agreed their current record of 1-5-1 inaccurately portrays their team’s ability. They argue their team is better than what the results show. Clark admitted the merge of the campuses has brought together a team of players filled with a lot of talent, but different styles of play. “No style has been completely defined yet,” Clark said. She believes the results will soon begin to show how talented their team is once a style of play is developed to showcase each player’s individual talents.
The women’s soccer team is back in competition on Wednesday, Sept. 18, at 4 p.m. at the LIU Soccer Park as they face Fairleigh Dickin-son University in their first Northeast Conference (NEC) game.

 The Portland Trail Blazers, an NBA team, hired alumnus Travis Demers (2003) as their new radio play-by-play broadcaster. He is the fourth ever radio play-by-play broadcaster in the team’s history. “To have the opportunity to do this at the highest level in the 50-year history of this team, only three people have ever done it and there are only 30 people in the world who has this job, it’s literally a dream come true,” Demers said.
Demers got the opportunity to fill in as the Trail Blazers’ play-by-play broadcaster in 2018 when their announcer of 21 years, Brian Wheeler, was unable to work due to health issues. Demers called 57 games for the team last season and will now do so full time. In his new position, he will broadcast every one of the Trail Blazers’ games. “When you turn on the radio to listen to the game, you will be listening to me,” he said. 
Ever since Demers was a child, he dreamt of being a broadcaster. “You imagine calling a big moment. You sit there in your driveway with your friends and you are broadcasting your little game. You are doing the voice, and you are doing the fake crowd noises,” Demers said. “This is something I’ve literally wanted to do my entire life.”  
Demers graduated with a BFA in communications with a specialization in broadcasting. In college, he worked for the school’s radio station, WCWP, currently known as the Wave, doing talk shows and play-by-play broadcasting for football, basketball, baseball and lacrosse. The experience he got at WCWP is something Demers has found useful in the real workplace. “The classes were helpful, but having the experience of working at the radio station WCWP, that’s what prepared me,” he said. “Getting the on-air experience while I was in college, getting to make mistakes, learn what to do and what not to do, how to be on air and how to not be nervous that was all really valuable.” 
Demers sees the school radio station, his advisor Dan Cox and the people he got to work with as important factors to his success. “Dan Cox really put me in a position to succeed and build my career. Without having the opportunities to do what I did at WCWP and to work with the people I got to work with, there is no way I would be here right now,” Demers said. 
“Travis was an outstanding sports broadcaster as a student at WCWP,” said Daniel Cox, director and station manager of WCWP. “He was persistent and very tough on himself. He strived to be better each time he called a game on the radio. I am extremely proud of his accomplishments, not just as a broadcaster but as a person.”
Even if Demers felt well prepared by the school, in the real workplace he soon realized that he still had a lot to learn. “I really didn’t know how little I actually knew until I got out to the real world,” he said. “I didn’t quite have a grasp of how challenging this industry could be.” He doesn’t blame the school for his unawareness and believes that a person needs to get out there to fully understand it. “There’s really nothing that can prepare you for that,” Demers said. 
In an industry where everybody wants their big break, a person never has a safe spot, Demers explained. “It’s so competitive, and you never really have any job security even when you are full time,” he said. “The uncertainty of this business is the most challenging thing.”
Demers had experienced difficulties with the industry several times. “I have been let go from multiple jobs and I have been told by bosses that I didn’t have a future in this business,” he said. However, Demers knew what he wanted, and he kept working towards his goal. “I worked hard and I didn’t let any of that get to me,” he said. “Things were really difficult but I kept working at it and that’s what you have to do. If you have a dream you have to fight for it and do everything you can to accomplish that.”
Another piece of advice Demers wants to give is to place oneself in the field they want to work within, even if it demands sacrifices. “Whatever your dream is, find a way to do that. Don’t do something else. If it means going to a small town or if it means leaving your comfort zone, find a place to do what it is that you want to do because that is the only way that it is going to happen,” he said. “Nobody is going to hand anything to you.”
During his career, Demers has worked at ABC Sports Radio as a producer, SiriusXM in Washington D.C. as sports update anchor, and at 1080 The Fan in Portland hosting a sports talk show, amongst others. Currently, alongside his new broadcasting job for the Trail Blazers, Demers hosts a sports talk show on Rip City Radio between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. 
After years of searching and hard work, Demers found what he searched for. “My entire life and my entire career I have always been thinking about what’s the next job. This is that job. I want to do this job for the rest of my life,” he said

 Some documentaries are made to share people’s stories with the world, and shine light upon situations to bring understanding to others. This is what one former student planned to do with his original work.
Film alum Justin Portaro (‘18) has a documentary about Mort Kunstler’s work, both well and lesser known, showing at the Heckscher Museum in Huntington for the exhibit of Mort Kunstler. It is his first documentary, and will air on WLIW, Long Island’s PBS Station. The exhibit of Mort Kunstler features paintings and drawings from the artist himself alongside Portaro’s documentary as a companion piece to the show.
The idea for the film came about as former congressman Steve Israel, also our campus’ former Chairman of the LIU Global Institute and Distinguished Writer in Residence, knew the Kunstler family and wished to produce a documentary on Mort. Israel and the dean’s office helped fund this production to serve as a potential inaugural effort film for a possible production company on campus called LIU Productions. LIU Productions never came to fruition.
“It never crossed our minds that it would get into the museum exhibit with Mort’s other works or even travel with the show, let alone get aired on PBS. I worked on these projects because I had a passion for the subject matter and wanted to share a story with the world,” Portaro said. “The recognition received over the past few months, although different, is rewarding knowing that the films will reach a greater audience and be able to share Mort Kunstler’s work and story with even more people.”
The exhibit is showing from Aug. 24 – Nov. 19 at Hecksher, then traveling to other locations throughout the country. Portaro’s film is also being broadcasted on WLIW on Oct. 28, Nov.1, and Nov. 3. It will be live online as well at allarts.org and on streaming apps under the All Arts Docs Selects category.
Susan Zeig, professor of film and chair of the department of communications and film,played a large role in helping Portaro with his first documentary. “She was a staple throughout the entire process and an amazing documentarian. Being able to sit with her and learn from her throughout this film has been invaluable and if it wasn’t for her the other things like the traveling exhibit or it getting aired wouldn’t of been possible,” Portaro said.

 The Arts Education Outreach program at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts started offering specialized dance courses for individuals with Parkinson’s disease, a nervous system disorder that affects a person’s movement. 
Stephanie Turner, director of education and outreach at the Tilles Center, discussed how this program came to be and why it was chosen, “Several studies have been conducted about the benefits of movement, especially the mind-body connection for patients with Parkinson’s, so they do very well with activities such as yoga, dance, boxing, anything that really connects the mind with motor skills it’s all about cognitive function,” Turner said.
The inspiration and program itself was a result of the Mark Morris Dance Group (MMDG). “They created a model where they train dance teachers to learn how to work with patients with Parkinson’s, and also people with limited mobility so [for] anybody who might have a physical ailment that might prevent them from dancing, it is a highly specialized form of dance that these teachers are specifically trained in.” Turner said.
The model from the MMDG was brought to the attention of the Tilles Center and aligned with the mission of the Arts Education Out-reach program. Part of their mission is to “serve the underserved,” and make art accessible to everyone. “We have programs for children with autism, from low socioeconomic communities on Long Island, and programs for children with pediatric cancer,” Turner said.
Turner and others involved in the program reached out to the MMDG to connect them with people who were trained in this kind of work. “We were then lucky to acquire a sponsor, so the program is fully paid for by a non-profit Dance Party for Parkinson’s,” Turner said.
Dance Party for Parkinson’s found it important to make the program easily accessible, so there was no admission fee. “The sponsor is very committed to offering these programs for free understanding the high cost it can often be to live with these ailments,” Turner said.
The program was piloted during the 2018-19 academic year, and four classes were held during that time. The program garnered enough interest that staff plan to offer it again through the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. Classes in September take place every Friday from noon to 1:15 p.m. There is another class scheduled in February 2020 and one more over summer 2020. All remaining classes have open availability.
Each session focuses on a different style of dance. “We have more classic dance, [and] general dance which includes, zumba hip hop, tap,” Turner said.
Instructors of these classes are also trained to deal with the often differing levels of mobility each individual might face. “Due to the differing levels of mobility, they may dance at different levels, the instructors are well-trained to accommodate everyone’s differences so that the classes work out very well.” Turner said. 
The Parkinson’s dance classes are not the only specialized courses that the program offers. “We are also working on a new program called sensory immersion theater. This is a new form of theater for people on the spectrum that takes place in a very small environment.” Turner said. Program staff will hold these events in the Patrons Lounge for children and adults on the autistic spectrum. This opportu-nity is slated to debut in May 2020, and will incorporate students from the theatre program on campus to interact with visitors.

 The Great Lawn Festival, a yearly tradition to kick off the start of the school year for students, featured some new attractions this year. The festival took place on Thursday, Sept. 12 during common hour, and  gave students a chance to take a break from their class schedules and enjoy themselves. The festival hosted carnival games, rides, and a live band called Easy Street. Complimentary pretzels, popcorn, and funnel cake were also served.
Some of the new attractions this year included a swing carousel, a human gyroscope thrill ride, and for those who were up for the challenge, a mechanical bull ride. The Great Lawn Festival was hosted by the Students Activities Board, with the help of the Promise Office. “The Students Activities Board works really hard to give the students what they want, things they’re interested in,” said Jesse Meaney, Resident Director & Coordinator for Events & Operations. “So we just take their ideas and we run with them.” Students and staff alike seemed to enjoy the event. “It’s cool that LIU does these things for us,” Shelley Dean, a sophomore musical theater major, said.
“I think it’s great, I think the students are having a lot of fun.” said Julia Pagano, associate director for student involvement. “It really gets students out of the classroom, out of their residence halls, to get involved and get to know each other.”

 Welcome back to school LIU students! As you start this school year it is very important to keep a couple key ideas in your head since your com-muting life is a lot different from that of a resident student on campus. Your days take more planning and may include putting a little extra money into that gas tank.
With this being the first year merging LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn, we have a lot of students com-ing from different areas all with the same intention: to be a LIU Shark, and to get one of the greatest educations Long Island has to offer. 
As you plan your travel schedule, I find it critical to leave more time than you originally planned, just in case you get stuck in traffic due to a broken down vehicle or a car accident. I find traffic on the highway can cause up to an hour in delays depending on what time you plan on traveling. 
One tip I have always kept with me commuting from over an hour away to campus is to plan my schedule with minimal traffic to avoid rush hour. Plan your schedule for midday and look to leave the school around 7 p.m. I have found that traveling at these times is a huge benefit when trying to avoid rush hour traffic in both directions. 
This is my senior year here, and throughout the years I would like to say I have seen it all on the highway, but unfortunately you never know what you’re going to run into during your morning commute. People on the road don’t have your same intentions and are often in a rush.
The two things you need when commuting are a lot of patience and good timing skills, and with those you will be just fine! I hope you make this school year as great as it is intended to be! Have a great year LIU students!

 There is a new operational director at The Wave, the campus radio station formerly known as MYWCWP. The last time an operational director was appointed was in 2003. This year, the position is back with a woman at the helm for the first time in the station’s history. In the reestablished role, Samantha Uebel will tackle the changes incurred by the OneLIU merger.
The locally run radio station cut the position years ago because it was no longer deemed necessary, according to Director and Station Manager Daniel Cox. With various changes like a new mascot and school colors, Cox decided to find someone to accommodate the increased responsibilities associated with becoming an NCAA Division I school.
Appointed by Cox, Uebel, a junior broadcasting major, said she is ready to take on the role. Formerly The Wave’s program director, Uebel admitted the new job comes with more responsibilities than her previous position. The operational director oversees all operations from both The Wave, which is online, and WCWP, on FM radio. “As the operational director, it’s my job to make sure everything runs smoothly at the station. I work with various department heads to operate events, productions, and the general operations of the station,” Uebel said.
The role does come with its challenges. Uebel expressed her frustration about the inability for student station members to speak directly with athletes for their sports broadcasts one of the many difficulties experienced while the school changes divisions. As per NCAA guidelines, Division I athletes and their coaches are not allowed to speak to any media outlets without the permission of their team PR manager. She is grateful that the new PR managers are easy to communicate with. 
Replacing Uebel as program director this fall is Daniel Casazza, junior social studies major. Casazza admitted the responsibilities of the new position, along with his class work-load, hasn’t been easy to balance. He was a member of the station prior to his promotion, and founded the live show Rushhour Rock. He is confident he will adjust to the changes soon. The position provides him “a platform to enact some change for the good of the station,” Casazza said.
Casazza explained he’s a perfect example that anyone can be a part of The Wave. He joined the station during the fall 2018 semester because he loved music and wanted to share his words on the subject. Joining the Wave is an “opportunity for people to step up and take initiative,” Casazza said, and he encourages everyone to get out of their comfort zone and try something new.
In preparation for the upcoming year, both Uebel and Casazza invite more students to become part of their team. With the transition from Division II to Division I, there are more positions to be filled at the station. “[The Wave is] a place where you can express your-self,” Uebel said, and she believes it is a “forum for people to speak.” Casazza added it’s a great opportunity to develop “life-learning skills” that you won’t get elsewhere.

 The long anticipated College of Veterinary Medicine that was announced to begin during the fall 2019 semester is behind schedule. The school, which was announced at the beginning of the 2018-19 academic year, is still undergoing the process of obtaining a letter of reassurance from the national accreditation body. 
The university must obtain this letter before they can begin recruitment for the program, start construction for the new facilities, lecture halls and labs, and publicize in any media outlets, according to Carmen Fuentealba, dean of the college of veterinary medicine. 
The accreditation body granted the university a site visit in 2018, the Pioneer reported in the Oct. 17, 2018 issue. According to several professors who were on campus this summer, the accreditation body made a second visit in August. 
Fuentealba did not confirm whether or not those visits occurred and gave no further updates, but promised to share details about the program once the letter of reassurance is received.
The projected cost of the vet school is $40 million, the Pioneer also reported in October 2018. Governor Andrew Cuomo promised $12 million in state transformative funds, and the university hosted several fundraisers, including a polo match on Sept. 15, 2018, to raise additional funds.
The Pioneer will continue reporting on the process as new information arises.

 In the midst of flu season, students looking to receive medical attention won’t be able to go to the Center for Healthy Living in most cases. They’ll have to travel off campus to the New York Institute of Technology. Medical and psychiatric referrals are made next door to the W. Kenneth Riland Health Center at NYIT. 
Where the Center for Healthy Living at Post is built to only serve current undergraduate and graduate students, NYIT’s clinics are built to serve the whole community, according to director Lynne Schwartz.The center at Post pro-vides students with psychological counseling, nutrition counseling, and health services. Their hours of operation for counseling or nursing services are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; nutrition services are Tuesday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
According to its webpage on liu.edu, the center is equipped with licensed mental health professionals, nutritionists, and a nurse available to provide consultation and support for students. “The most important aspect of running our center is to provide supportive counseling and nutritional services to our students,” Schwartz said. The center’s staff are available to discuss concerns of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, self-esteem, eating disorders, sexual assault, gender identity, domestic violence, suicidal ideation, grief and loss.
NYIT’s medical facilities became the main clinical care facility for Post after a deal between the two campus was established in 2014. Services offered by NYIT’s clinics are family medicine, physical therapy, internal medicine, occupational therapy, speech pathology, psychology, acupuncture, physical medicine and rehab, radiology, exercise stress-testing, a wellness program, genetic counsel-ing and Adele Smithers Parkinson’s disease treatment center. 
Dr. Brian Harper is the chief medical officer and an associate professor of clinical specialties at NYIT; John Lopez is the director of health center operations at NYIT. 
“We operate year-round, so we’re talking about 8 a.m. to about 5:30 p.m.,” Lopez said. The center is open Monday through Friday. The health care center at NYIT is known for providing osteopathic manipulative medicine through their D.O. (osteopathic doctor school) program.
NYIT’s medical center promotes specialty services to Post, including sports medicine. “We work closely with LIU regarding the athletes coming to receive their physicals and what have you,” Harper said. “We work closely with athletes from our own college and local high school athletes as well.
Students can find the Center for Healthy Living on campus in the basement level of Post Hall or contact them at 516-299-3468 or post-healthyliving@liu.edu, as well as follow the center on Instagram @liupostcenterforhealthyliving. Shuttle service is provided to NYIT’s center when warranted.

 The former Dean of the College of Arts, Communication and Design (CACD), Steven Breese, was appointed to a dean’s position at a different school, leaving some LIU students without a permanent dean for the start of the 2019 fall semester.
Post welcomed Breese to the dean’s position back in August, 2017, after 25 years of leadership in the field. Just two years later, the actor, director and playwright accepted a new offer to serve as the artistic director of the Pittsburgh Playhouse and dean of the Conservatory of Performing Arts at Point Park University in Pittsburgh, PA. Breese fully intended to stay at LIU for a while, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, but the dual position was too much to pass up. Ed Weis, Vice President of Academic Affairs, will assume the duties of the position until a new dean is found. 
Following Breese’s departure, the chairs and a few faculty members of the CACD school voted unanimously to appoint theatre and film professor, Jon Fraser, as the department’s interim dean; however, the university opted against it. “I was associate dean; I was acting dean; I was senior associate dean, but I was in the dean’s office for 12 years, which is why my name came up. I had already done the job for many years,” Fraser said.
Professor of Communications and Film,  Dr. Barbara Fowles, attended the meeting and voted in support of Fraser. “We chose Jon partly because he was very willing to take on the job, and no one else was eager to do so, since the administration is so difficult to work with,” Fowles said. 
It remains uncertain why the university turned down the department’s recommendation. No further explanation was given, according to Fraser’s knowledge. The school’s determination comes amidst many changes and additions to the CACD school, including the recently introduced bachelor of science in communications program. “We are now in a situation where even minor paperwork must be funneled through academic VP Weis, who is vastly over-extended making for a difficult work process,” Fowles said. 
Weis seemed inclined to accept the department’s vote, and asked them for a letter in support of Fraser, according to Fowles. “The decision to not hire Jon – or anyone – was made by those above Ed Weis, and I assume it as a money-saving measure,” she said. “It certainly is not a helpful decision.” A letter was written promptly and primarily by Cara Gargano, the chair for the department of theatre, dance and management, and then given to Weis. When The Pioneer asked Weis for clarification on why the school declined to have Fraser step in, he said, “The University cannot comment on personnel matters.”
An ad was posted to LIU’s website on August 29 for a position titled “Dean, Visual Arts & Design.” Another ad was posted to Indeed.com on approximately Sunday,  Sept. 1, under the same title.  As of Thursday, Sept. 17, two weeks into the start of the fall semester, both ads have yet to be removed.

 In light of the destruction to the Bahamas caused by Hurricane Dorian, LIU Cares is hosting a hurricane relief drive for the week of Sept. 16-20. 
The relief was created in hopes that the campus community, as well as the larger community outside the campus, could come together during this time to donate as many items as possible to help the survivors of Hurricane Dorian, according to Julia Pagano, associate director of Promise. In the Bahamas, a number of homes and businesses were destroyed and much of the land itself was completely submerged beneath the ocean’s waves.
Members of the LIU Cares program handed out a list of items that different relief centers have requested in order to give whatever aid they can to the hurricane victims. Students can pick up a copy of the list at the Campus Concierge. 
Beginning Monday, Sept. 23, LIU Cares will hold a drive to collect these items. Students interested in more information can anticipate social media posts and flyers about the event. Residential assistants will also inform students about the relief.

 Starting in the fall 2019 semester, the Post Foundations class will be getting a new lesson in sexual assault awareness. The spring 2019 Student Government Association came up with a new program, the Sexual Respect Campaign, to educate the fresh-man class on how to define con-sent, sexual harassment, and sexual assault and on what resources are available to students facing these issues. 
SGA brought the idea to leaders of the Post Foundations (POST 101) classes and the Center for Healthy Living in the spring 2019 semester. “It was a great idea coming from student leaders taking the initiative. We agreed to facilitate whatever they want to do,” said Dr. John Lutz, English professor and chair of the First-Year Experience Committee. “I was very glad to make a place in the curriculum of Post 101, which is the transition to the college culture.” 
Faculty discuss the topic of sexual assault and Title IX – a federal law that guarantees that no person in the U.S. can be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity based on their sex – during fresh-man orientation each year, but in less detail than the new program will, according to Lutz. 
Lutz applauded the SGA’s initiative. “I took the SGA’s word for it when they said it’s important,” he said. “They saw a deficit and they decided to make changes to the culture. Here are the norms that are acceptable, and here is where we have zero tolerance for this thing, and there is a great need for this.” 
Many students are unaware of what constitutes sexual assault, a harsh reality that SGA President Ashley Rodriguez finds astounding. “There is a lot unknown across the board. Most people hear sexual assault and they think rape, but it isn’t just that. There are so many different forms of sexual assault and harassment. There are different types of outlets for students and ways they can talk about this too,” she said.
The SGA created a power point detailing everything students need to know, including the LIU Student Bill of Rights. The 2019-2020 peer mentors and Post 101 instructors will implement the power point presentation, not the SGA. Instead, the SGA will table in Hillwood Commons periodically and continue the conversation of the campaign, but won’t be directly involved in the training or teaching. 
“We’re not equipped [to teach]. But we ensured that the power point had resources,” Rodriguez said. “We worked closely with the Center for Healthy Living and faculty to ensure we aren’t putting out false information.”
Lynne Schwartz, director of the Center for Healthy Living, will take over the training. The training is similar to what resident assistants go through undergo IDS 100, where they learn are taught leadership and public speaking skills. “We want them to be comfortable with the material and to talk about it with sensibility,” Lutz said.
Their training this year included learning about bystander intervention— when you see something, say something— and “Direct, Delegate and Distract,” a program geared towards freshmen to help prevent sexual harassment and assault, according to Schwartz. There are 21 peer mentors undergoing training this fall semester.
Nicole Ludwig, a junior psychology major, has been a peer mentor since spring 2018, and she feels strongly of helping freshmen adjust. “A lot of people go into college having learned conflicting things or [have] certain misconceptions in regards to sexual respect.”
Ludwig finds that schools with minimal coverage leave students ignorant, which can be dangerous. “Students need to know how to keep themselves safe as well as how to make sure they don’t end up harming someone else,” she said.
Schwartz also stressed the importance of this program. “The bottom line is, we’re here for the students and whatever that means— if I have to tap-dance, I’m not good at it, but I’ll try,” Schwartz said. “There’s no other way. We have to do what we feel is right for the students.”
The first Post 101 presentations begins Wednesday, Sept. 18. The next step after the first year of the program, according to Rodriguez, is to bring the presentation beyond Post 101 and to the upperclassmen. “The power point should be shared with all students,” she said. “Especially with Greek Life and club training as well.”

 Dr. Joan Digby, English professor, was dismissed as the director of the Honors College as of  September 1. Digby received word of her dismissal from the director position two weeks prior to the start of the fall 2019 semester, and did not receive a  direct response as to why she was being replaced. “I do wonder why I was edged out and what they have in mind for changing the Honors College,” she said. Digby is a tenured faculty member and will continue to teach English this semester. 
Digby learned of her replacement from Vice President of Academic Affairs Ed Weis while inquiring about her contract stipend in mid-August. It is unclear who made the final decision concerning her replacement. Digby said she would have been happy to introduce administrative faculty to people in the National Collegiate Honors Council (NCHC) who have experience and are searching for open positions. “Being excluded from decision making about the future [of the honors program], I felt was really wrong,” Digby said.
“We are extremely grateful to Dr. Digby for her leadership in the Honors College. She played a vital role in evolving the honors program into a respected Honors College.  Dr. Digby remains a highly valued and respected professor,” Weis said, in response to an inquiry regarding the reason behind Digby’s dismissal.
Having taught English on campus since 1969, Digby became director of the Honors College in 1979. “It’s been a fabulous professional life,” she said. “I’ve loved being at Post, it’s an incredibly wonderful campus to work at.” Digby admires the campus’ landscape and enjoys interacting with the local cats and horses. She also had a part in developing the equine studies minor.
Digby is the president of the LIU chapters of Phi Kappa Phi, an honorary society for junior, senior and graduate students, as well as Phi Eta Sigma, an honorary society for freshmen with a GPA of 3.8 or higher. Digby established a relationship with the National Park Service in the form of Partners in the Park, a learning program where students can experience the great outdoors. In 2018, she received the Founders Award from the NCHC for her leadership in honors.
With many changes coming to campus, including the addition of a veterinary medicine school, Digby was ready and willing to adapt the honors program to accommodate the new students and majors. In 2018, she came up with a way for students in the fine and performing arts departments to complete their tutorials and theses with a reduced number of credits. 
Digby’s new office is 209 in Winnick House. “Of course, I’m always glad to talk with my students, and I know a lot of my students who are upperclassmen in the program, and I’m not just going to disappear from sight,” she said.
Daniel Hanley, assistant biology professor, and Heather Butts, adjunct nursing faculty member, will serve as the new co-directors of the Honors College. “I met with the new people. They really are going to be starting honors from scratch because they have no experience directing honors,” Digby said. “I don’t know what they have in mind. I am extremely worried that their new direction might diminish the structure of the program.”
“We are very excited about the scientific research, community engagement, and public policy opportunities that they can facilitate for Honors students,” Weis said in regards to the new directors. Hanley and Butts were informed of their new positions on Sunday, Sept. 1.
“We look forward to a productive and exciting year of honors courses and events,” Hanley wrote in an email sent out to honors students on Wednesday, Sept. 11. “While you have been settling back to school, or settling into college for the first time we’ve been planning for exciting internships, professional development workshops, and community service projects for you this coming year.”
Honors students can still expect to see a familiar face when visiting the honors office. Tracey Christy, secretary for the Honors College, will be present to help students with any questions they might have. Previously, Christy took over Digby’s role twice when she was out on sabbatical. “She’s going to help the new directors get up to speed, and I will too,” Digby said. 
“We are honored to be working with Tracey Christy… and helping students navigate through the program,” Hanley wrote in the same email. “For those of you who have been in the program, please do not be concerned about any changes to the program that will impact your progress. Everything will remain as it has been in terms of your requirements.” The new directors will occupy Winnick House office 126.
As for measures taken to ensure honors students have a smooth transition, Christy’s position as secretary remains unaffected. “I don’t know if or how it could change,” she said. Christy has worked with Digby for over 22 years and served as co-director of the honors program in the past. 
“As long as I’m here, I will continue to help the honors students and deal with situations as I always have until I am told otherwise,” Christy said. She would like honors students to know that they can still visit the honors college office for questions regarding schedules, tutorials and theses.
“I grew to love the honors college and appreciate why we have it,” Christy said. She had a hand in recruiting for the college. There are 95 freshman enrolled in honors for the 2019-20 academic year, almost double the 49 who enrolled last year. The honors program enriches student education and prepares them for the future, according to Christy. “Tutorials and theses have helped plenty of students get jobs,” she said.
“It’s a wonderful program. Dr. Digby is just a wonderful person, she cares about each and every student,” Christy said. “She will do whatever she can to help students get ahead and to learn and to be the best they can be.”
