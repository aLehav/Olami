What does it mean to be a woman? Where and when did the concept of womanhood come to life? The answers to these questions can be found on the stage in PTC’s production, “Age of Elizabeth.”
Follow modern Elizabeth and her mother’s story of betrayal and her journey through a timeline of mother-daughter relationships in past generations of her family, and the lessons that were passed down by each; discover how the trials women had faced in the past impact the future and define womanhood.
Written and directed by Logan DeWitt, the idea for “Age of Elizabeth” arose from a topic of discussion on nature vs. nurture within DeWitt’s household, where she is the only biological child of seven. DeWitt started to question learned behavior to search for the reasoning behind womanhood.
“I started writing it about a year ago,” DeWitt said. The script is still changing and transforming as the actors go through the workshop and rehearsal process.
The cast consists primarily of women: five Elizabeths, following the usually male tradition of passing down a name, and one man who plays every male character within the show.
DeWitt wanted to center the focus on the women of the play, as opposed to the men, an attempt to pass the Bechdel test. The test identifies the roles of female characters within a play or film based on three questions: whether they are named, interact with other female characters, and talk about anything other than a male character. In the entertainment industry today, many films fail that test. This pushed DeWitt to have a female-driven show.
“It’s really interesting being in this specific show,” said Cayla Michael, sophomore musical theatre major playing as modern Elizabeth. “There are a lot of things that she (Elizabeth) goes through that is personal to me and other people in my life.”
An overbearing and involved mother pressures Elizabeth, an issue that Michael sees reflected in some of her friends. “It gives me a sense of what they must have gone through,” she said.
With all of the focus on content and meaning throughout the play, the set itself is made to be simplistic in a fair contrast. Containing a single chair, three hanging frames to serve as time dividers, and walls on the sides covered in photos, the set establishes a place in time without drawing too much attention from the messages of the story.
What DeWitt wants is for the audience to examine the relationships they have in their own lives and what messages they are sending to one another through their interactions, especially for women. “Are we building one another up,” DeWitt asked, “Or are we subliminally tearing one another down?”
“Age of Elizabeth” will be showing at the Rifle Range Theater on Oct. 28-29 at 8 p.m. and Oct. 30 at 3 p.m.

The Little Theatre, next to the Theatre, Dance, and Arts Management Building, located across from the library, does not have sufficient heat or air conditioning, according to students in the theater department who performed in the recent “Trojan Barbie” production.
The building, which was part of the original Post estate, is now used as a black box theatre by theatre, musical theatre, and dance students for their performances throughout the school year.
With rigorous vocal and physical work, improper ventilation puts a strain on the performers, students say. The facilities department did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the lack of air conditioning in the building.
For the talent on stage, overheating is a major issue. Senior theatre major, Angela Downs, was part of the cast of “Trojan Barbie,” which ran from Oct. 7 to Oct. 16. Downs battled with stagnant heat that consumed the backstage. “I had to wear a tight corset and there were times when it was too hot in the back and I felt like I was going to faint. It wasn’t from the corset, it was just too hot,” she said. “The dressing rooms are the worst because we have the mirror lights on and the doors shut. There are so many people in there at once, all moving and in a hurry.”
There is one window in each dressing room. However, because the dressing rooms are technically underground, the windows barely help. “We can open the window, but it opens up to basically what is just a hole in the ground,” Downs added.
On stage, matters only get worse once the lights hit the overheated performers, students allege. Audience members do not have the same experience as the performers because they do not have lights beaming on them. Yet, it can get uncomfortable for the audience too, according to Post Theatre Company’s general manager, Heather Drastal.
“We do not usually produce shows in the summer, but in the early fall and spring it does get really hot in here,” Drastal said. “There is a ventilation system that was recently repaired when we had a new roof put on, but it is not an air conditioned building.”
The staff behind the scenes at the shows is having a similar experience as the performers on stage. Gabrielle McAree, the assistant director of “Trojan Barbie,” had issues with her contacts from the dusty, dry environment that comes from lack of ventilation. The junior musical theatre major had to continuously put in contact solution because of itchy eyes. McAree mentioned that cast members got sick during the week because of the long hours around insufficient air supply.
“It would definitely help to have an upgrade or new appliances in the theatre,” she said. “Performers are in the theatre rehearsing for four and a half hours a day and they should have proper air and heat!”
The issue with updating the ventilation system is the age of the building. “I know that it requires major funding to install a cooling system into a building this old, which is why it has not been done yet,” Drastal said. “There has been discussion about it on numerous occasions over that last several years, so I know it is on the radar of the University.”
Cara Gargano, chair of the theatre, film, dance and arts management departments recognizes the efforts facilities puts into the building. “One of the things about our facilities is that they are very specific,” Gargano said. “They spent a fortune on giving us proper equipment and we are in constant discussion about how we can improve. Personally, I am very grateful.” Facilities did not provide any information on their plans for the theatre.
Although the space can be a challenge to work in, theatre majors are nonetheless grateful to have it. “I think it is pretty wonderful of the faculty to let us use the space as freely as they do. It really is our home,” Downs said. “I know of other schools with better conditions, but they are so particular about it that the students don’t get to use it to their convenience.”

Do you love food? Then you’ll love that there is a whole day dedicated just to celebrating food. Oct. 24 was National Food day, a day set to inform people of the food they consume and the effects it has on their health.
Post’s nutrition club and future sustainability club partnered with the Dietetic Internship directed by Cynthia Pierce and set up a booth in Hillwood during common hour to celebrate with free healthy snacks and fruit smoothies. Trivia questions and medical information on healthy eating in the U.S. were exchanged for a taste
of snacks and drinks that could improve health.
Wild rice chips, organic cheddar popcorn, and a variety of fruit smoothies were offered. Andrea Senenman, one of the four dietetic interns, shared that the smoothies were made with a mixture of fruits and also included almond milk and sometimes peanut butter, which provide sources of protein.
“We are promoting the consumption of whole, healthy foods,” said Jessica Jaeger, a dietetic intern. Other topics among health included sustainability, hunger in the U.S., plant based diets, and the comparisons between vegetarian health and the health of excessive meat eaters.
Chelsea Gold, president of the nutrition club, along with Pierce and her interns, provided students with information of how we eat today, in hopes to potentially change how we eat in the future.

As the Pioneer reported last week, beloved psychology professor and chairperson of the psychology department, Gerald Lachter, passed away unexpectedly on Oct. 12. Professor Lachter was teaching three courses this semester, including “Introduction to Psychology (PSY 3),” “The Behavior Analysis program classes (PSY 607, PSY 659 and PSY 658),” and “Experimental Psychology 1 (PSY 21).”
Dr. Danielle Sauro, a graduate of the psychology doctorate program, has taken over the Introductory Psychology course. Suaro is a new professor on campus. Professor Olegunnar Zetterstroem, a graduate of the Masters of Arts program, has taken over the Experimental Psychology course. Psychology professor, Dr. John C. Neill, is teaching the Behavior Analysis (Experimental Methods in Psychology 1) classes in the Master’s Program.
According to Dr. Nancy Frye, the department is “having conversations” to decide who will take over as chairperson.

Early on Friday, Oct. 21, a rain garden was planted next to the Facility Service Building. Led by William Kirker, director of facility services, and assisted by students, Christopher Roerden and Erica Ferrera, the goal of the planting is to decrease the flooding of the parking lot and purify the water, as the water is intended to be picked up by the roots of the new plants.
This may seem like a minor project, but there is a big chance there will be more sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions applied on campus in the near future, as campus is stepping up the game on sustainability this semester.
Initiated by Professor Scott Carlin, the Center for Sustainability is launching soon. Building upon several years of initiatives to improve campus sustainability, the new center was approved by the faculty committee this past summer as part of the university’s over-all new strategic plan—“LIU 2020: Education Beyond Boundaries.”
Carlin will serve as the director of the center and run a committee with members from different facilities, as well as students. He says the mission of the Center is to expand interdisciplinary education and research opportunities, with the vision that this will lead to all students understanding sustainability principles and being able to relate them to their own personal and professional goals.
One way to reach this vision, according to Carlin, is to create models for new interdisciplinary courses, making it possible for students to acquire knowledge in other subjects besides their major, and becoming aware of the difficulty of dealing with problems that concern several areas.
However, the whole agenda of the center is far from written in stone. Carlin says that the Center now enjoys a more official level of support from the university and faculty, and is hopeful that the students and faculty members can help define the concrete work to be done.
One of the students taking advantage of this opportunity to influence and get involved is energetic freshman, Erica Ferrera, who is responsible for launching a new student sustainability club. The club will work as a subbranch of the initiative and will focus on what the students can do to improve aspects of sustainability on campus, according to Ferrera.
Ferrera says that an important part of the center and the club is to educate. Next up is a panel discussion with the topic, “The Presidential Election & the Climate Challenge” in Hillwood Commons, during common hour on Nov. 1.
Ferrara plans to make sure that the club’s activities won’t be limited to only discussions and spreading information. Several practical projects are planned, including campus farming. The club will, in cooperation with Aramark, LIU’s food service, spend the fall and winter learning more about farming using the campus greenhouses. Then, in spring the plan is to start growing crops that Ferrera hopes eventually could make it into the school’s food program.
But there are also other areas where Ferrera sees opportunities to make real change, like improving the recycling and reducing waste. “There are lots of small things to improve and we want to make it fun and personal, so students feel connected to the cause.”
The club hopes to use knowledge from students, for instance, theses from students majoring in environmental-related subjects. However, Ferrera is convinced that joining the club will be beneficial for students in every field. “We will learn how to be sustainable, which is important in today’s society, and it is a great way to start as a college student.”

A national Fox News poll conducted between Oct. 15-17 shows Hillary Clinton with 45 percent of the national vote, Donald Trump with 39 percent, Gary Johnson with five percent and Jill Stein with three percent. According to these statistics, Hillary Clinton is in a commanding lead. This poll is not an outlier, as the majority of national polls have shown Hillary Clinton with the lead since Oct. 1.
The poll with the largest sample size so far in October was an NBC News poll conducted between Oct. 10 and 16; it polled 24,000 people. This NBC poll showed Hillary Clinton with 46 percent of the vote, Donald Trump with 40 percent, Gary Johnson with eight percent and Jill Stein with four percent. The decided margin of error for this poll was relatively small, at just one percent.
In the battleground states of Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio, the polls have shown that the race remains tight. A CNN/ORC poll conducted in Nevada between Oct. 10 and 17 signaled that 46 percent of Nevada residents supported Hillary Clinton, 44 percent support Donald Trump and seven percent for regional darkhorse Gary Johnson.
In North Carolina a CNN/ORC poll conducted between Oct. 10 and 17 showed that the race there is very close, with Hillary Clinton coming in with 48 percent of the state’s support, Donald Trump with 47 percent and four percent signaling they will vote for a third party.
As for Ohio, a CNN/ORC poll conducted between Oct. 10 and 17 proved in Hillary Clinton’s favor as she is showing 48 percent of voter support compared to Donald Trump’s 44 percent; this poll showing the ineffectiveness of Donald Trump’s ‘Rust Belt’ strategy, which included targeting former big industry towns with his ‘bring back jobs’-pitch.
Post students are formulating their own opinions as to who is leading in this presiden- tial race. “I think Trump is winning, it’s not just my opinion. I think the pundits are hyping up Hillary, but it seems like according to things I’ve read online, American’s are saying Trump won both debates,” said Nick Buthcer, a senior, biomedical technology major. When asked whom he would be voting for, Butcher said, “I’m undecided, but I think I may go third party. Personally, it’s important that I vote.”
Not all students think Trump is leading. Sophomore, business entrepreneurial major Connor Farrell, said, “I think Hillary is ahead, primarily because the media and government want her to win.” When asked whom he would be voting for, Farrell said, “I want Trump to win because I just don’t trust Hillary.”
Some students are skeptical of the polls. “I don’t trust the polls. I think most people won’t say honestly [whom] they are voting for until Election Day,” said Brenden Gaghan, a senior history major. “I go off the debates, I feel like each won one debate. It’s probably closer than most people think.”

It might never be too early to get a head start on your spring schedule, yet some students seem to disagree.
Success coaches sent out emails just three weeks into the fall semester, informing their students that pre-registration for Spring 2017 has begun. Furthermore, the emails stated appointments should be made between Sept. 28 and Oct. 7 for students who would rather have a walk-through with their success coach than register online.
But, according to Beth Wilkow, associate dean of university registrar, pre-registration takes place during the second week of October. The email sent by the registrar conflicts with the emails sent by the success coaches, which gave different times to set up a spring schedule. Some students had already met with their success coaches before the appropriate scheduling time suggested by Wilkow, and were only able to register then.
So, the question of timing pops up. Why are the success coaches pushing pre- registration so early?
“Early enrollment provides the most opportunity for students to plan their schedules,” Wilkow said. Meeting early on with advisors to review the program and plan ensures that students are taking appropriate courses leading up towards graduation.
Some students appreciate the early registration. “I’m glad I got it out the way,” said Alexia Bridgett, a freshman dance major. Others, have concerns about potential changes in meeting days and times for classes after the early registration date.
Many classes on the spring schedule do not yet have assigned teachers or times. Yet Wilkow said it’s “not unusual” that all professors’ names are not listed, as teaching schedules are still being finalized.
While students are notified by the Registrar’s staff when changes occur, having two required classes that run simultaneously, may result in taking an extra semester to complete them all.
Despite the instructions from the Promise Office to begin registration earlier than normal, a few students would argue the later the better. Damario Hussey, a freshman bio-anesthesia major, said, “They should wait a little longer because people may want to change their majors.”
Pre-registration has already taken place, though some students haven’t stepped foot in the Promise office yet, for reasons ranging from laziness to indecisiveness. The question then becomes, how early do you need to be?

Halloween may be one of the very few times during the year when people can dress up in costumes and not have to worry about looking crazy. It’s also one of the holidays that require creativity and imagination. Questions that come up around this holiday usually revolve around whom or what are you going to be? Are you making your costume by yourself or are you buying it from a store? What inspires you?
“This is the hardest holiday for me because I have so many ideas to choose from I just get overwhelmed,” said Taylor Hill, a junior broadcasting major. “I mostly like the parties that come with the holiday but a great costume sets off the tone for my night.” Ideas get harder and harder every year especially when movies like “Suicide Squad,” “Captain America,” and “Doctor Strange” all come out in the same year, and become new fan-favorites.
“The only thing I don’t like about Halloween is the costume search because for me it has to be sexy but scary. I can’t just walk out looking a hot mess,” said Shakira Clarke, a sophomore public relations major. “Originally I wanted to be Harley Quinn, but after social media got a hold of the idea, I instantly dropped it.”
What to do when you want to be original? “I’m having my mother assist me in making my nun costume,” said Alexis Armstrong, a freshman biology major. “I chose to be a nun this year because I feel like everyone’s going for either superhero or sexy, so I’m going to be the total opposite. Hopefully I won’t be turned back from any parties,” she said jokingly.
Hot Topic and Spencer’s at Broadway Mall are just a shuttle ride away for students on campus. Stores like Party City, Hot Topic and Spencer’s cater to those in search for a costume, but after a visit to a Spencer’s in Boston, it was shocking to find that the store was full of costumes but no customers. “I think people are starting to realize that our costumes are pretty expensive, and are taking the alternative route by making them. I’m not dressing up this year, but if I do I’ll probably just throw on something from my closet,” said Josh Almonte, a store manager at Spencer’s.
“I don’t think Halloween should be celebrated anyway because I feel like too many people drag things and make them ridiculous,” said Julia Avanta, a mother who purchased her daughter a princess costume. “I’m only letting her go because it’s my sister’s house and all her cousins will be there. If it weren’t for that, I most definitely wouldn’t buy her a costume.”
The National Crime Preventions Council has released tips for keeping Halloween safe and preventing crime from happening. Crime Stoppers around the country have also released safety tips through media to ensure that everyone stays safe. The list deals with safety measures for kids who look to go trick-or-treating. The full list of tips can be found on the National Crime Prevention Council website.
The Black Student Union on campus has organized to have a “Halloween Ball,” which will take place on Oct. 27 at 7:30 pm in the Tilles Center. Even though costumes aren’t a must, there will be a costume contest. Besides the ball, students will have to venture off campus for Halloween amusement.

I looked up at the mansion while sitting on a bench near Humanities: the sun was shining, the grass gleaming and the birds chirping. This whole setting was stunning. It was in between classes, and so it was very quiet. A quaint breeze flew through my newly long hair. I listened to the rustling trees making a tremendous noise, dropping perfectly alive dead leaves.
I had Hegel in one hand and a coffee in another (drinking it the right way, of course). I felt so at ease that I pulled out my journal and just wrote about how I felt and what I was thinking. I tried to come to a conclusion about whether I was actually thinking at all. Of course, I completely negated myself—I was thinking about not thinking…duh!
But the most perfect thing was, I was thinking although I wasn’t thinking about anything; I was in a mode of bliss, taking in the environment and what was around me. It was a serene moment of meditation, which I wasn’t in control of. A flawless, exquisite moment.
Shouldn’t we cherish moments like this? An unforced, natural happiness, which the sun really brought home. We all know that weather, the ‘Indian summer,’ isn’t going to last. The fierce, brisk cold is on our doorstep, and although I love winter and the ‘koselig’ feeling, as the Norwegians would say (meaning cozy), I don’t think there is anything better than a sunny day with a slight breeze, and a gorgeous campus to top it off, right?
I think the most tremendous part of the feeling at that moment was that it was totally unexpected. I, for one, had no idea that a Tuesday in mid-October was going to turn into a sensational sunny slumber of shorts and sunglasses. We have to enjoy these days while they last. Before we know it, a hot chocolate and a turtleneck will be needed to pinch through our weekly adventure of academia.
As I was sitting on that wonderfully weathered bench, with Hegel on my right, blessing me substantial (hopefully you get the pun) security and wisdom, a few of those perfectly alive dead leaves suffered the force of gravity and graced me with their presence on my shoulder. Instantly, the delicateness and its message of serenity made me smile.
As I wrote last week, a tiny gesture such as the refinement of a leaf dropping from a tree on to me, made me happy. But what also got to me was, not only was I being witness to the beautiful Mother Nature; a fitting song from Fleetwood Mac caressed my ears…“You’ve got me mystified,” the voice sang.
What the heck? If there is something more mystic than what I have described, let me know. A religious man might be persuaded to tell me that I was lost in heaven. (And yes, I just compared the outside of Humanities Hall with the white pearly gates of heaven). But that’s the beauty of not only a beautiful summer’s day, but a beautiful day.
Please enjoy a beautiful day, enjoy it while it lasts, and cherish those moments of genuine happiness. When we are suffering from stress at school or work, or suffering under the hands of life, we can go back to that blissfulness and smile. “Because of your smile, you make life more beautiful” – Thich Nhat Hanh.

The Post Cecillia Chorus will be performing on Dec. 10 at Carnegie Hall. This is the ensemble’s third year performing at Carnegie Hall and it will include songs in Bach’s “Magnificat” in D major. Senior Alex Martinez, a music performance major, will be performing with the ensemble for his third and final time.
Martinez aspires to write his own music, perform on Broadway, and help the world with his music and voice. He learned how to play the piano in two years of lessons, and taught himself how to play the guitar. His love for music is influenced by rock, jazz and musical theater. “Each genre pertains with everything and relates with each other,” he said.
His musical interests vary, as he prefers not to listen to country but can listen to every other genre. “I can listen to Taking Back Sunday’s song ‘My Blue Heaven’ then switch to ‘Nancy’ by Frank Sinatra. I listen to everything,” he said.
The solos at Carnegie Hall will be open to professionals in the music industry, and the professional performances held at Post will allow students to audition for solos. Solos have not been announced for Martinez to audition for, but preparation for this event at Carnegie consists of two to three hours of practice every day for each performer. Martinez has a different method after practicing with the chorus. “I take an hour off every day to lay down, relax and take a breather before getting into all of my work. The piece will suffer and so will you if you overwork yourself,” he said.
Professor Mark Shapiro’s connection with Carnegie Hall has paved the way for students to perform at the venue for three straight years, after opening with a sold out event in 2013. Martinez is not a nervous performer, even while performing in front of a large crowd at Carnegie. “I put my energy towards the excitement, especially with a big crowd,” he said.
For the next few months, Martinez is preparing a recital with songs that he’s learned. The songs will include genres like classical, jazz, and musical theater. Some songs that he’s learned, however, are not in English. “It’s a life requirement to learn songs and see why you’re singing them. What it means to you affects how you sing the notes. You need to find meaning in the songs,” he said.
At Carnegie Hall, performers are required to wear black and white while on stage. The men are wearing a full tuxedo and bowtie, while the women are wearing dresses. This year’s ensemble has a larger ratio of females to males, and has new music with lots of movement and sequencing that balance different segments of the performance. Martinez has a positive mindset going into the performance for the last time. “I want to make it the best that I can make it,” he said.
The Cecillia Chorus performance at Carnegie Hall is open to all audiences. For more information or to purchase a ticket, visit www.carnegiehall.org or call 212-247-7800.

A quote from the artist Tupac reads, “Real eyes, realize, real lies.” This quote applies to the film, “The Girl on the Train” because the vision of the truth can, and will always recognize the sight of deception. This makes a perfect story for a filmmaker, which is why “The Girl on the Train” has now been adapted from book to film. Although, there are discrepancies between what occurred in the book and the film, the movie still managed to be a success.
In “The Girl on the Train,” divorced alcoholic Rachel (Emily Blunt), rides the train to New York every day and develops an unnatural obsession with a married couple who live in a house she travels past every day. When the wife suddenly disappears, she integrates herself into the investigation by posing as the missing woman’s friend.
The film does an amazing job at showing us the depth of Rachel’s alcoholism. In the beginning, viewers will find themselves confused as to why Rachel is having blackouts and what is actually causing them. Although her blackouts are used as a plot device, they serve the mystery by positioning her as an unreliable narrator. While confusing, it is still a thrilling aspect of the film. It makes you unwind different theories as to what could have caused her to blackout, or if what she is seeing during her “remembering stage” actually occurred.
Throughout the film, Rachel is a watchdog. She watches the couple and her ex-husband almost like an undercover investigator. The train commute she makes every day in the film is to New York, as opposed to the book where she commutes to London. With this commute, she is avoiding questions as to why she doesn’t have a job. The film makes viewers believe she does have a job in the beginning but she is never shown working. This is part of a presence she maintains to hide the fact that she lost her job and is just obsessed.
The director, Tate Taylor, uses methods such as shallow focus, voiceovers, and slow motion scenes to show psychological states, which help make the movie feel nightmarish. While the movie may seem familiar to 2014’s “Gone Girl,” directed by David Fincher, Taylor has a different style than Fincher’s that he uses to lift the film above a “Gone Girl” imitation.
Blunt’s performance in the movie is amazing as the film does a great job of showing how women               self-destruct in the real world. Her “questionable” moments as she wakes up from blackouts to her attempts to act sober and unthreatening as people around her make her feel little are perfectly pieced. Towards the end of the movie, long after her traveling has come to an end, we finally come to realize what is actually occurring and how the world she lives in was a complete lie. The film includes plenty of symbols, like the train, and how observing a life through windows and actually confronting what you see are completely different things.
“The Girl on the Train” is now playing in theaters.

Two years ago, a group of top musicians came together to announce a new streaming service called Tidal. Those musicians included Alicia Keys, Arcade Fire (Win Butler and Regine Chassagne), Beyoncé, Calvin Harris, Chris Martin, Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Jack White, Jason Aldean, J. Cole, Kanye West, Ma- donna, Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Shawn “JAY Z” Carter, and Usher.
Tidal was created in Oct. 2014, and allows you to stream songs, music videos, mix- tapes and various other musical content.
Fast forward two years later and Tidal hosted its second charity event on Oct. 15, in Brooklyn, N.Y. This time, the event was put together to raise money for the Robin Hood Foundation in order to help its education initiative. With performances by Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, Lauryn Hill, Robin Thicke, Nicki Minaj and many more, this night was one to remember.
Lauryn Hill, who is known to be late to her performances or sometimes not even show up at all, did arrive but performed a little late. After Lauryn Hill, the DJ got the crowd pumped up once more for the next guest to perform. Within five minutes, everyone was rapping along to “Roman’s Revenge,” as Nicki Minaj walked out.
You would think a show that has Beyoncé or Alicia Keys on its list would mostly consist exclusively of their fans, but that was not the case. I was immediately shocked at the variance in the stadium. The crowd finally became alive after a long night of performances, and once Minaj arrived on the stage, it was like New York was seeing the female version of Jay Z for the first time, after a long absence.
“I’m sorry I can’t hold my tears back right now, it’s just so amazing how she owns the stage and lets it be known that she’s in the building. She’s my idol and even my mom’s idol and she hasn’t even been around that long,” said Sherika Thomas, a 22-year old nursing major at Morrisville State College, who attended the event. “I came all the way home from school to grab my mother so we could come to this show together.”
Minaj knew that she had a huge presence on stage that night. Without her backup dancers and huge stage decorations, Minaj was still able to perform like the champion she is. Surprisingly, she didn’t perform any of her pop hits such as, “Super Bass,” “Starships” or “Anaconda.” She chose the songs that she knew her audience was looking for. “I don’t know if she’s angry right now or if this is the direction she’s going for the next couple of months, but I don’t want her to stop, this ‘Slick’ rapper Nicki is the Nicki I fell in love with, and I’m so happy she’s coming back,” said Tysheem Samuel, a Brooklyn resident, right after Minaj performed her verse from the smash hit “Monster.”
After performing “Win Again” from her third studio album, Minaj told the audience, “Champions will do what champions do.” Then, she offered her political perspective, saying “Barack needed a Michelle, and Bill needed a Hillary, you better pray to God you don’t get stuck with a Melania, y’all want brainless females to stroke your ego?”
Minaj is known for giving inspirational speeches at her shows, but this was more of an endorsement for Hillary Clinton. Minaj then went on to twerk for a minute before bringing Fetty Wap out as her special guest.
The performance ended with Minaj singing “Moment For Life” and reminding the members of the audience that they are special, asking them to promise her they’ll never give up on themselves.

Without senior signal caller, Jeff Kidd, to lead the offense against American International College on Saturday, Oct. 22, the football team turned to fellow senior Matt Brennan. After one half of a play, Brennan suffered a knee injury, which forced the team to turn to its third option at quarterback—red-shirt sophomore Michael Campbell.
Thanks in large part to a dominant running back trio, the team extended its winning streak to eight with the 22-7 win, and remains unbeaten. Senior, David White, led that department with 98 yards and a score, while red-shirt sophomore, Malik Pierre, had 73 yards and two touchdowns of his own. Freshman, Tim Marinan, ran for 70 yards on just 11 carries.
A field goal at the end of the half led the Pioneers to 3-0 at the break. After a long kick return to start the second half, the Pioneers ran it down AIC’s throat seven straight times, culminating in a Pierre touchdown from one yard out.
In the fourth quarter, two more rushing touchdowns, one by Pierre and the other by White, pushed the lead to 22-0. The Pioneer offensive line won the battle up front all day long, leading to huge holes for the tailbacks to weave in and out of.
Although the Pioneers surrendered a late touchdown, the defense was stout all day, limiting the Yellow Jackets to 165 total yards of offense. Freshman defensive back, Joshua Flowers, had eight tackles and two pass break-ups; red-shirt junior defensive lineman, Anthony DeNunzio, had six tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble. Red-shirt junior defensive back, Jared Chester, also contributed a tackle and an interception.
The Pioneers improved to 8-0 on the season and 7-0 in conference. AIC dropped to 3-5, and 3-4 in the NE-10. “The team’s vibe is humble and focused; going undefeated doesn’t mean much to us,” said Clarence Sears, senior defensive back. “We won a conference championship two years ago so our goal is to go as deep into the national playoffs as possible.”
Head Coach Bryan Collins and his team return to the field on Saturday, Oct. 29, when they welcome NE-10 conference opponent Pace University to Brookville, N.Y. for their regular-season home finale. Kick-off from Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium is scheduled for 1 p.m.

The new women’s bowling team will start its first season Sunday, Oct. 30, in Farmingdale, N.Y. The team of six girls is led by Coach Ed- ward Raven.
LIU Brooklyn has had a bowling team since 2008, and in March 2016, the athletics department announced that there would be a varsity women’s bowling team established on campus this semester. Raven, who is a nationally certified United States Bowling Congress coach and former 10-year member of the Professional Bowlers Association, created the team.
Many of the girls, including freshman Brielle Spillett, look up to Raven. “He’s a well-rounded individual and a great coach. He always knows which adjustments to make, and he will help you fix the little things he sees,” she said.
Spillett bowled at a competitive level from the seventh grade until her senior year of high school. One of her most memorable experiences bowling before Post was her ability to learn from her sister Kylie. “I got to bowl on the high school team with my sister for three years. I loved having Kylie next to me during every practice and match, and she taught me everything I know,” Spillett said.
With her average score at 195, Spillett’s goal for this season is to stay focused, bowl well and have fun. Being on the bowling team has helped Spillett make new friends who share her love for bowling. “I love being on the bowling team. The girls are extremely friendly and fun to be around,” she said.
Senior Stefania Cuomo, who is also on the new team, has been bowling since she could walk. Cuomo was part of the Valley Stream PAL Bowling League from age five. Cuomo is enthusiastic to bowl for the Green and Gold. “I’ve been saying since I started coming to Post in fall of 2013, that the only thing that can top off this great university and great college experience is if we had a bowling team, so for me, it’s a great feel- ing to be able to represent Post outside of the classroom,” Cuomo said.
Though Cuomo’s average score is 180, she is nervous about bowling at an NCAA level. She believes that competing at that level will be challenging and more intense than her previous experiences in high school and other leagues. “I think it’s important to just do my best, have fun with it and encourage my teammates,” Cuomo said.
The women on the team have practice two to three times a week, and also work out in the gym. Cuomo is enthusiastic about getting to know the other members of the team. “I’m excited to be able to work with them and share this experience together,” she said.
The season is about to begin, and fellow Pioneers can expect to see great performances and teamwork from the inaugural season of the women’s bowling team. The squad has yet to make season-long goals, but Cuomo said, “Coach reminds us to be consistent, have fun and try our best.”

Coming off the heels of its seven-goal victory over Daemen College five days earlier, the men’s soccer team bested Molloy College in overtime, 3-2, on Thursday, Oct. 20, to improve to 12- 0-1 on the season—dropping the Lions to 9-3.
The team proved once again that it has the ability to win in so many ways. Junior midfielder, Harry Pearse, who netted the game-winning goal against Molloy, said, “We have tremendous character. Being able to come back from behind at Mercy, then winning in over-time at Molloy is all down to how much work we put in during pre-season and the hunger we have as a group to win every game.”
Pearse is second on the team with nine goals and first on the team with shots taken so he sees his fair share of scoring opportunities. This goal was different, however. Pearse said scoring a goal of that magnitude was “an unbelievable feeling” and “one of the best [feelings] a player could ever have.”
Pearse netted the game-winning shot in large part because of senior forward, Jason Lampkin, and sophomore midfielder, Charlie Ledula, who both executed an odd-man rush.
Earlier in the match, the Pioneers drew first blood just a minute in when junior back, Johan Mauritzson, found the back of the net. The Lions re- grouped and evened the score in the 16th minute.
The Pioneers took the lead once again in the 24th minute thanks to Ledula and his team-leading 14th goal of the year. Just like earlier, the Lions pulled even, this time tying the game late in the second half.
For the majority of the match, the Pioneers held the advantage in ball control and pace, and that was evident in shot attempts as well; the Pioneers held a 14-9 advantage in that department.
The team returned to action on Sunday, Oct. 23, against St. Thomas Aquinas College in front of its home fans and delivered a 1-0 overtime victory.
After nearly 100 scoreless minutes, the Pioneers broke the tie and scored the game’s first goal. Lampkin sent a cross into the box and Ledula took it from there, heading the pass into the mesh for the goal.
The 100th-minute winner was a culmination of the work done in the first 99. The Pioneers held a 17-9 shot advantage, which included four shots to none in the overtime session. In addition to shots, the Pioneers also had 13 corner- kick opportunities.
Senior keeper, Jesper Malmstrom, stopped both shots that came his way and earned another shutout victory. The team extended its winning streak to four games, and stands at 13-0-1 on the season.
Pearse acknowledged the fact that the team has a zero on the loss column and said, “Staying undefeated is a goal of ours, and we are strong enough to do it. We just try to be the best team that we can be every game, and with the personnel that we have, hopefully go all the way.”
The no. 2-ranked Pioneers return to action on Wednesday, Oct. 26, against the University of the District of Columbia. The home finale is set to start at 2:30 p.m. from the Pioneer Soccer Park. The Pioneers’ 13 seniors are getting acknowledged before kick-off.
