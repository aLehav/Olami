Fifteen years after its initial creation, C.W. Post’s TV Studio, PTV, has received a major overhaul, bringing this studio state-of-the-art, high-definition capabilities.  The ribbon cutting ceremony included special guest and Post alumni, David Steven Simon, whose work includes producing “Sister, Sister,” and “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”
Financial assistance from a New York State grant allowed Post to go ahead with upgrades but not without a sizeable contribution from the university itself.  “For every $1 [from the state] we put in $2 and we had to pry it from the state’s cold, dark hands,” Provost Paul Forestell said jokingly.
In addition to HD capabilities, there has also been structural re-modeling of the studio now allowing for a much larger control room, conference room, prop storage and digital editing room.  “Our control room is now large enough to fit an entire class,” said Kathy Betka, the station manager at PTV. “We no longer have to break the class up into groups, allowing us to move forward more quickly than ever before.”
Not letting the recent upgrades allowing her plans for PTV to stand idle, director Jean Carlomusto hopes to see a make-up room and news lab additions in the near future.  “I would like everyone to come down and at least see [the studio].” Carlomusto said. “It is a great opportunity and now with our HD capable studio; skills can be developed for the pro [television] world.”
Patrick Holbert, from the graduating class of 2003 and now a producer for MTV’s True Life, came back to visit Post for the grand re-opening of PTV’s facilities.  Internships from WPIX, MTV and HBO “equipped me with skills for the real world” said Holbert. “[At Post] students are allowed to do projects above and beyond what they can do in the classroom.”
Long Island University President David Steinberg made a statement at the event saying “education does not have to be painful” citing the hard work and experiences of students who dedicate much of their time at PTV.  “This is a student centered campus,” Steinberg said. “I wish the students to use this facility regularly, and to use it hard…”
Looking to get involved with PTV? President of PTV, senior Heather Lonks is looking for anyone to get involved with the studio.  Meetings are Tuesdays at 5:30 PM in the studio located on the second floor of Humanities Hall, room 214.  For more information, email ptv@cwpost.liu.edu.

This summer, the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library made a few major changes to its website to make researching easier for students.
The library’s link on www.liu.edu, has set up a new system that allows students to instant message the librarians live with questions. The process is pretty simple: students make a new username for themselves by clicking on the, ask a librarian link on the website; then they just type the librarian what they need and how they can find it.
In order to receive these services a student must have a barcode on his or her student ID card. The barcode can be received at the reference desk in the library.
Students are encouraged to take in the other numerous resources the library has to offer. So, next time you’re in need of a research question or you’re tied up with a paper you have no idea where to start, just instant message a librarian!

Post Students Learn about Peace Corps Volunteer Work 
By: Robert Rockefeller
Assistant News Editor 
On September 13, the Peace Corps held an information session at C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University from 12PM to 2PM at the Kahn Discovery Center. The two hour presentation gave Post students an opportunity to learn the valuable experiences that can be gained from joining such a worthwhile organization like the Peace Corps.
“I’m interested in the Peace Corps because I studied abroad in Australia,” said Erin Lusenskas, a 22-year-old graduate student majoring in Childhood and Special Education. “I had friends who joined and am interested in learning more.”
Many facts and experiences were learned and shared during the session. For example, the Peace Corps serves 77 countries throughout the world and was started in 1961 by John F. Kennedy. Education makes up 33 percent of volunteer jobs in the Corps while Youth Development and Health HIV/AIDS account for 18 percent of volunteer work in the organization.
The Peace Corps is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year and is currently in the midst of “growth phase.” The Corps is forecasted to expand within the next few years and mainly visits college campuses like Post to seek out applicants who are currently working towards completing a bachelor’s degree.
There are many benefits that go with being a Peace Corps volunteer. For example, those that complete service earn up to $7400 dollars in benefits and up to 18 months of healthcare coverage. Being a part of the Peace Corps looks good on a resume and can instantly put a job seeker on the top listing of being considered for a government job.
In addition, students who complete service have the option to pursue a Masters degree after or during enrollment. For example, there is a Masters Degree Program that allows volunteers to utilize after the Peace Corps experience. Secondly, students can join the Masters International Program, which allows students the opportunity to apply for a graduate level education during the first year of service.
Students interested in learning more about the experience of a lifetime with the Peace Corps may email questions to Jason Cascone, Director of CW Post Career Services and/or visiting www.peaceCorps.gov.

The International Student Union is Back on Campus
By: Alea Rahim
Online Editor
According to the International Student Service (ISS) Office of Long Island University C.W. Post, there are over 750 international students on campus. However, with a large number still on the rise, the international scene on campus doesn’t seem to match its increase in admissions. This year, this statistic motivated a group of students to re-instate a student led organization that will change the international student scene: The ISU.
The International Student Union was originally created in 2006. However, due to its inactivity on campus, the organization was removed. Four years later, the union has finally been revived and is making ample changes. During their first meeting last Thursday, the ISU provided a list of events they would be holding this semester. Their schedule included a variety of functions from trips to the city to on campus parties.  All of which, they stressed, should be attended by both international and domestic students. The members of the ISU constantly emphasized on uniting all students on campus together in order to teach and learn from one another. According to Vice President Trista Lu, it is crucial for the ISU to better educate students of the world and its cultures.  As there are 53 different countries being represented here at CW Post, it would be ideal to explore the traditions of each nation.
The most important addition to the ISU is the structure of the club. Instead of the general meetings and the usual 4 e-board members, the organization is hoping to replicate and act like the Student Government Association (SGA). “We have committees,” said ISU President Jae Won Cheong. “We’ll be allocating budgets for other organizations under us, and we’re hoping that sometime in the new future, we’ll make it mandatory for all international students to take part in it.” There will be a total of five committees and the union is saving 53 positions for one representative from each country as sub-committees. The ultimate goal is to have ISU be the center of all things International on campus.
The union is still in process of finalizing its structure and events but is hoping to gather more supporters at this Wednesday’s club fair. “I know we’re new,” said Trista Lu. “But we’re ambitious and anxious for the year to come. With the international students united, we’ll help better our campus life.”

As we start getting used to being back at Post, there are many changes for us to notice. Not only do we now have a common hour, many new laboratories, and energy-saving projects in the works, but this year there was a significant increase in the number of freshman that enrolled as well.
Post had an incoming of 900 freshmen for the Fall 2010 semester, as opposed to last year’s 859 freshmen, Joanne Graziano, Assistant Provost for Admissions and Recruitment on C.W. Post Campus said.   And surprisingly enough, the free Ipad had nothing to do with it. Freshman Connor Gaffey, a film major, stated that he chose Post because of its film program as well as a faculty and student body who seemed to be constantly helping each other.
Another correlating factor to the increased number of freshman this year is that many new students enrolled have either a sibling or alumni on campus. In fact, 95 are the children or grandchildren of past C.W. Post students, as stated in a report from Rita Langdon, Director of Public Relations and the Office of Admissions.
Aside from students having family ties at Post other reasons freshman chose our school include; the academic programs we offer, scholarships, and our location. Seven hundred twenty nine of the total 900 freshmen at Post are from New York alone.
Knowing this information, it can be assumed that perhaps the class of 2014 really did come to C.W. Post because of their love for the school and what it has to offer, not just an Ipad,  That we should all be proud of.

Around the country, people are still dealing with the dilemma of universal health care. On one hand, everyone wants to be good, compassionate people and help their neighbors. On the other hand people hate to spend their money, and are afraid of catching the vicious and incurable plague known as socialism. One could say that a similar dilemma confronts students at C.W. Post.
Some complain that the Student Health and Counseling Center provides less than exemplary service. While, the health center is open Monday through Friday, 8 A.M. to 8 P.M., the hours that a medical doctor is available are limited to two to three hours per weekday. Arguably, this may prevent students from accessing qualified medical care on campus.
According to some, the limited hours also force students to make the choice of either visiting the physician or going to class. Furthermore, the waiting time in the infirmary can sometimes be extensive.
“I don’t expect them to have a hospital on campus,” said Michael Greco, junior at C.W. Post.  “People just like to complain about s**t.” Perhaps Greco has a point. It may be that students should consider the fact that if a student believes he needs to see a doctor, it should not be that difficult to prioritize.
Otherwise, it seems that the only solution to this supposed issue is to charge students more to pay for an around-the-clock, on-location medical doctor. The rise in cost would probably be marginal compared to the total costs of attendance here at C.W. Post. Nevertheless, one cannot help but wonder if the general student body is willing to pay to placate the worries of a few students.
The crusaders of complaint have previously been a topic for discussion, but is there more to this situation than arbitrary grumblings?

Remember when you were a little kid and you said “I want to be a fireman” or “I’m going to be a superhero.” Well, we all grew up. We even made it to college, and now it is time to choose what we are destined to become.
A large handful of us are now facing a decision: what major do I choose?
It may feel strange to choose something you could be doing the rest of your life, but it really does not have to be that way. Especially in this economy, people change jobs everyday. Whatever happens, you can always go back to school or you can get training in another field.
When you decide your major, you should weigh in your strengths as well as your interests. Take a look through the undergraduate bulletin, which is available online. Once you’ve made a list of your top three majors, try and narrow it down to three.  Then, take a walk over to Kumble Hall to pick up the plan of study for the three majors.
As you are looking at these plans, go back to the undergraduate bulletin and see what the required classes will be like. If you can, talk to some people you know in the major, get their opinion on the classes and the major itself.
The one thing you should not do is to choose one major over another because the classes are too difficult. That being said, if you find all the classes will be too difficult then that major is obviously not for you. However, if you choose, for example, english over business for the sole reason that business requires you to take more math classes you may want to reconsider.
Once you have thoroughly researched your three favorite majors, list the pros and cons for each. This may help narrow down the reasons why you like or dislike each one.
At this point it would be beneficial to make an appointment with your advisor to discuss your pros and cons list. Along with discussing the majors, you can also discuss the classes you would take, and the career opportunities you’d have with a given major. Most advisors have years of experience helping students, and can probably give you some helpful pointers.
If you choose a major and find you don’t like it, don’t worry! You didn’t fail or waste your time. There are students everyday who realize their chosen major is not for them and they change their minds.  Should you decide to change your major, speak with an advisor and they will guide you in the right direction.
The most important thing to remember in this process, whether you are declaring a major or changing one is that the decision is all up to you. Do whatever you feel is in your best interest and will be most beneficial.

Whether or not you know what “gluten” is, after learning about it the bigger question is “Why on earth would somebody go gluten free?”
Gluten is the tough, viscid, nitrogenous substance remaining when the flour of wheat or other grain is washed to remove the starch –eventually cause the tiny, finger-like protrusions lining the small intestine to wear down to nothing.  So when the question arises “why someone would voluntarily go gluten free” I still have no idea, for I still am asking myself the same question. Let’s be real, the best foods that exist on this earth have glucose. Mac and cheese, pizza, beer? I couldn’t imagine life without it. However, after a trip to the doctor for a simple stomach pain, I finally understood why such foods should be cut out. I was told that I was suffering from an irritable bowel syndrome, commonly referred to as IBS. According to Dictionary.com, IBS is any combination of common disturbances of the bowel –sometimes accompanied with psychological stress. After the doctor explained the symptoms of such a syndrome, I was confused because they didn’t exactly match up to what I was feeling. As weeks went by, my stomach pains got worse to the point where I had to stop exercising, then eventually stop eating. I had no idea what was going on with my body until I stumbled upon a show about Celiac Disease.
Celiac disease, also known as gluten intolerance, is a genetic disorder that effects at least one in 133 Americas. When the talk show started to explain the symptoms of such a disease, it matched up completely to how I was feeling. In no way was I diagnosing myself with Celiac, but after hearing the doctors on the talk show explain the causes and effects, I cut out all gluten from my diet. I knew this wouldn’t be easy, for what is a better alternative to 99 cent boxes of pasta and frozen pizzas. However, I was willing to do anything to rid my stomach pain and starting exercising and eating how I normally would. The hardest part was refusing to eat the bread basket at restaurants, until I found out Gluten free breads exist (as well as bagels, and even mac and cheese!) Any food that contains gluten, there exists the exact product made without it.
I have currently been eating Gluten free for two weeks, and my stomach feels better than it ever has, even before the gluten problem. Something that started out as a 30 day experiment turned into a life changing experience. I’ve even started a blog about it glutenfreethewaytobe.blogspot.com. Every day is still a challenge, especially when I’m not eating at home. As hard as it may be to give up some of my favorite foods, “what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger.” OK well that is a bit extreme, but you get my point. Try to go gluten free just for 30 days, and see the benefits right before your eyes. It is incredible.

This year, Koreans around the world will be celebrating one of the nation’s most important holidays this month. Dubbed as Korea’s “Thanksgiving”, Chuseok- also known as Hangawi- falls on the lunar calendar on the 22nd of this week.
Chuseok is a 3-day holiday that celebrates a good harvest under a full moon while feasting over traditional foods, and a time for Koreans to visit their ancestral hometowns. It is a holiday where families meet and share quality time together by playing cultural games and having a decent meal at the dinner table.
For 20-year-old Korean sophomore Sun Kyung Yoo, this will be her first Chuseok away from her family. “It’s already hard when we [international students] are so far away from home and feel home sick,” said Yoo. “It’s harder when it’s Chuseok and I can’t be with my family.” Yoo’s Chuseok would consist of taking a 3 hour drive to meet her relatives, then spend the next couple of days enjoying the meals prepared by her family members while catching up with her friends and relatives. In America, Yoo doesn’t have the opportunity to meet up with her family but she refuses to spend it alone.
“I may not have my family,” said Yoo. “But I have my friends here on campus and I am willing to share this tradition with them.”
As the treasurer of the Korean Student Association, Yoo and her fellow club members are planning a celebration for not only the Korean students, but for everyone on campus. The KSA is hoping to gather as many students and teachers as possible to make this Chuseok a less lonely holiday.
“We should always celebrate our holidays together,” said Yoo. “We should eat, laugh, and have fun on these days.”
The KSA will be celebrating Chuseok on Friday, September 24th at 1:00pm in the Chapel on campus.

Most college students face the challenges of balancing school with work and, not to mention, the occasional nights of going out with friends. Some of your fellow students juggle full-time jobs and internships as well. You wonder how these guys sleep sometimes. After talking to a few C.W. Post students about their schedules, it became clear that even though everybody has a set of different priorities, school remains the most important.
Alexandra LaRocca, a junior Public Relations major, works as a waitress on the weekends for quick cash. “Going to school full-time while working hours during the weekend is definitely hard, but it’s something I have to do,” LaRocca said.  “I wish that I didn’t have to work so much to pay for school, but at least I know I’m getting a good education, and it’s all worth it in the end.”
However, senior Journalism major, Melissa Wolff, has chosen not to hold a job during school. “I have a scholarship and need a 3.0 GPA for it. It’s too difficult to keep a job and keep up with my grades, so I chose to just focus on my schoolwork,” Wolff said.
Some students, like junior Photography major Emily Rawson, choose to work on-campus as part of the work-study program here at C.W. Post.  As an assistant in the Photography lab, she helps students develop photos and work on the computer software. “It’s really convenient,” Rawson said.  “I’m able to do my homework while I’m there. And my boss is really easy going, he doesn’t pressure us.”
For each person, the decision may be different.  But whatever the circumstances may be, we must remember that college is a reflection of what’s to come for our future.  Whether we’re trying to handle a job, a family, a husband or just simply the bills, it all ends up becoming a balancing act.

Last Saturday morning Jared Ciborowski, the new president of Student Government, took time from his busy schedule to tell readers about his big plans for the 2010-2011 school year. Jared, a junior majoring in early childhood education, was said to be “everyone’s best friend” when students were asked their opinions on the new SGA president. Jared is currently a resident who enjoys watching a variety of sports, hanging out with friends, and spontaneously going out to have fun. Jared has held many leadership positions on campus before becoming president of the SGA; he was an RA, Orientation leader, member of SGA and SRA, head of the food committee and orientation coordinator. When asked why Jared wanted to be president his answer was simple, “I feel that I can make positive changes throughout the school and know that my ideas will be supported and put into action. I have been a big student voice for awhile and have given up my status as RA in order to take on this position and I am confident that my friendliness and respected voice will help to make the necessary changes on campus.”
The SGA is an organization that welcomes all students to join and voice their opinions and concerns about Post. The SGA serves three main purposes. One is to be the mediator between the students and administration. Two is to be the voice of the students. Thirdly, the SGA oversees all clubs around the campus, making sure they are up to date with all of their paperwork.
When asked what Jared generally expects of this academic year he responded with full confidence that he wants to “ make students feel they have a voice,” on what is or isn’t going on within their school.  Jared wants the SGA to be a well-structured organization that will be the leader of the campus and its students.  So far, the SGA has already extended the food hours such as the Subway in Hillwood Commons and in Winnick–along with the “banner bash” which takes the written concerns of students and divides them among groups and clubs in order to make sure that these are no longer concerns.
For this school year, Jared and the SGA plan to continuously improve the campus. Jared claims that, “ not all improvements are materialistic, it is about building the student body to be a whole, not separated into groups such as commuters and residents but grouped all as students of C.W. Post.” The SGA also plans to install luxuries such as HD channels, WiFi in the residence halls and having a meal plan for the commuter students who are just as much a part of this school as the residents. Already, we have received new and “beautiful” shuttle buses that now include trips to Pathmark in order for students to grocery shop and/or get special items that they need. All the renovations, future and current, are because of the concerns and comments of the students. SGA simply listens to the students and does everything it can to make the necessary changes.
As for the new addition of common hour, Jared explains, although commuters may be angry at the fact that they might have to stay an hour longer, it is only to benefit every student. A lot of people including Jared felt that due to long schedules and heavy workloads, an hour in the day should be dedicated to “not thinking about classes but doing you.” It is felt by many that with hectic schedules, many students are not getting the full college experience.
It is often overlooked that the SGA is here to help the students become one body. In order to do this, it looks at all angles of the campus and figures out what it is that our students deserve.  When asked about the compliance of the administration, Jared explains, “administration is very cooperative and very understanding of the needs and concerns of the students. So making changes such as extending the food hours was no problem for the SGA because the administration is not here to strictly control us but to make us as satisfied with our school as we can be.” 
The SGA meets every Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. in the Top of Hillwood Commons and is always looking for new members at anytime.  Jared wants freshman to know that they might want to join  “ in order to represent a voice and leader on campus where you will hopefully find your own niche.” For those pondering the idea of joining SGA, you should be aware that “you will know that the ideas and actions you have in mind will get done and that your ideas will help your fellow students.”
Jared specifically would like to point out that on September 23rd there will be a Town Hall meeting during common hour [location to be determined] in which you will be in the presence of administration. Jared welcomes everyone and will give them an open floor to voice their opinions and concerns directly to administration. This is a great opportunity for everyone to show their voice and leadership within the C.W. Post community.

Nutrition
 By: Kathleen Crowley
Features Editor
Welcome back to reality. Summer vacation is now over and it is time to fall back into a healthy regime. Together as a school, let’s start on the right foot this semester by making better decisions as to how we treat our bodies –both inside and out. The bottom line is, we are what we eat and there is no exception to this rule. Throughout campus history, it is known that one of the biggest epidemics we fear is “the freshman fifteen” –and don’t let its name fool you, for students of all classes become victims to it.
This year the new staff of the Pioneer is going to feature a weekly nutritional guide to keep the student body here at C.W. Post healthy. We will include nutritional facts, tips and advice from both professional nutritionists and trainers as to how to stay fit, what we should and shouldn’t eat, and how to maintain a healthy life style here on campus. After this week’s issue, which will include a basic introductory to our new program, each week here on after will feature exciting topics such as new work out plans, easy but healthy breakfast/lunch/dinners offered on campus, and optimistic adjustments and encouragement to keep you going and speed up your results. Have faith in yourself and the staff of the Pioneer to walk your way towards the healthier you.
Getting Started
YOU CAN DO IT! It is a fresh new semester where we all are given the opportunity for a fresh new start. Enough with the excuses and the procrastination. We all have the ability to get the bodies we want, we just have to want it. Nothing works over night, and no diet in the world is instantaneous. Mark today as day #1 and from now on just keeping getting healthier. Since each of our bodies and metabolisms are different, you need to create a well balanced diet that suits you. 
Well-balanced diet: activity, moderation, personalization, proportionality, variety, gradual improvement.
 
On MyPyramid.gov, locate the online food guide called “MyPyramid” to get help on creating your own personalized diet. This site will provide each individual with a personal guide on finding out what foods are essential for your particular body.
 
MyPyramid.gov recommendations for the amount of different food groups one should intake daily: 
 
Ten Healthy Commandments: 
Eat when you’re hungry; know when your full. 
Don’t fear calories: Calories equal energy, you just need to know how to fuel your body appropriately. The more active you are, the more calories you need. Generally, active men need between 2,400 to 3,000 calories each day; whereas active women need 2,000 to 2,400.  Less active women should aim for 1,600 to 2,000; less active men need 2,000 to 2,400.
Portion Control: What your served and what one’s serving is, are to completely different things.
Listen to your body: Due to stress, distraction, and/or boredom, most of us ignore the signals our bodies are telling us, resulting in overeating or extreme dieting.
Snack Smart: Rather than a quick fix of a candy bar or bag of chips, go for a fruit or whole grain snack. Always keep healthy snacks around; throw a Winnick apple and/or banana inside your bag after breakfast for a healthy pick-me-up during the day.
Don’t mix up thirst and hunger! Most of us think we’re starving when we really are just dehydrated. Before indulging, drink a glass of water, wait 5-10 minutes, and then reassess your appetite. (Drinking water is crucial for weight loss and an overall healthy body.)
 Read the nutritional facts before you eat. Just because it’s “fat free” doesn’t mean the sugar content or sodium content isn’t skyrocket. Look at the ingredients and be query of artificial ingredients, unnecessary trans fat and hydrogenated oils.
Eat five or six small meals a day. By eating five or six small meals a day keeps your metabolism running, your blood sugar levels stable, and a stable energy level.
Don’t deprive yourself of anything, the key is moderation.
Trust yourself and have patience. This itself is the golden commandment. Take each day at a time and don’t expect instant results.
On Campus Eating: Please understand you don’t need the luxury of an organic super market or the brain of a plastic surgeon to know what is and isn’t “healthy.” Whether you’re eating at The Winnick or at Hillwood Cafe, there are a variety of healthy options for all types of appetites –you just need to be smart.

Men’s Football 
By: Matthew Saur
 Staff Writer
The weather was perfect for football at Hickox field this past Saturday. With a cloudless blue sky overhead, the Pioneers were set take on the Mercyhurst Lakers, however the outcome wasn’t as pretty.
The Pioneers again scored first when quarterback Erik Anderwkavich tossed up a 23-yard pass that was caught by wide out Sean Persh in the end zone to give Post a 7-0 lead. While the Pioneers held the lead, they looked sharp on defense, sacking Mercyhurst quarterback Garret Kensey and forcing a fumble that was recovered by defensive lineman Andrew Jackson.
Post controlled the clock for all but three seconds in the first quarter, yet in those three seconds the Lakers managed to tie the game. Lakers quarterback Garret Kensey took it himself for a nine yard dash past Post defenders before the quarter ended.
The Lakers capitalized in the second and third quarters where the Pioneer offense struggled mightily. With the Pioneers were held scoreless, the Lakers scored twice to up the score to 21-7. The Mercyhurst defense was relentless forcing Anderwkavich to throw three interceptions, forcing a fumble that they then recovered and blocked a field goal attempt by Post kicker Paul Stoltz.
The Pioneers offense showed some resilience attempting to come back twice in the fourth quarter. The first was a four play 59-yard drive down the field that ended with Anderwkavich, running into the end zone for a touchdown to cut the lead to seven. However, the Pioneers defense couldn’t hold the Lakers down on the next possession as they took a 28-14 lead after a score. Yet Post came right back with another touchdown to make it 28-20 after Anderwkavich made a nice pass to Kyle Hardy, to score a 12-yard touchdown, but the point after was blocked. But time ran out and Post dropped their second in a row at home.
The bright side for the Pioneers came in their persistence and drive. The offense totaled 458 yards; Anderwkavich 17 of 29 passing for 233 yards while gaining 173 yards on the ground. Thomas Beverly had another fine game rushing for 87 yards along with wide reciever Darnell Williams, who led the Pioneers with nine receptions tallying a 133 yards, while Kyle Hardy and Sean Persch each reeled in a touchdown pass. On defense Ronnie Modik and Billy O’Connor combined for a total of 27 tackles, including O’Connor’s career high 16.
The Pioneers look to recover from this two game slide next Saturday when they head to Shippensburg, PA to face the Raiders (1-2). Coverage starts on 88.1 FM and wcwpsports.com at 12:30pm, with kick off slated at 1pm.

Women’s Soccer
By: Heather Norris
Staff Writer
The C.W. Post Women’s Soccer team walked away from this past weekend with a victory and a tie, improving their record to 3-1-2 overall and 1-0 in the East Coast Conference.
Thursday evening’s away game against Philadelphia University ended in a two-all tie. Senior Ivana Babic, just named ECC Offensive Player of the Week, led the Pioneer offense with a goal and an assist while junior goalkeeper, Allie Weiser, recorded 11 saves. Babic’s goal was the only of the first half and lasted until 20 minutes into the second half, with a goal by Trisha Sileo. Senior midfielder Jackie Sousa gave Post the lead again but saw it disappear when a miscue in the backfield led to an own goal. However, the girls would hang on to end the match in a draw.
On the road again Saturday, the Pioneers walked away with the 4-1 victory against rival Molloy College. In their first conference game of the season C.W. Post got help from strong offensive plays by Babic and fellow senior, Sanna Pettersson. The Pioneers scored twice in the first half, once by Babic, off a penalty kick, and once by Pettersson, to take a 2-0 lead at the half.  Molloy was able to find the back of the net and cut Post’s lead to one at the 52 minute mark but junior back Tove Eriksson responded quickly with a goal of her own to putting Post ahead again by two. Twelve minutes later, freshman Alexa Niciforo scored off a breakaway to nail down the victory.
The Pioneers will have a week to rest before they face neighboring rival New York Institute of Technology next Saturday, September 25th at NYIT in Old Westbury.

Women’s Field Hockey 
By: Heather Norris
Staff Writer
Last Thursday, C.W. Post forward Amanda Nann put on a show for the home crowd as she broke the program record for career goals with a hat-trick against the Owls of Southern Connecticut State University.
The senior’s 53 career goals beat the previous record of 51, held by Amber Limanni, class of 2009. Nann’s achievement coincided with the team 4-1 non-conference victory making the Pioneers undefeated at home this year. Her three goals led the scoring for the Pioneers, who outshot their opponents 32-5.
The Pioneers took early control of the game with a goal from freshman forward Carlee Dragon, with the assist coming from Nann. Nann’s first goal of the game put the Pioneers up two at the sixteen minute mark. The Owls, however, were able to cut the lead in half with a goal by Erica Fisher late in the first half. Fisher’s effort would be the only point tallied by Southern Connecticut as two more Nann goals, one assisted by PSAC Player of the Week Vicky DeRosa, gave the Pioneers a solid 4-1 lead.
Currently ranked sixth in the nation, C.W. Post improved their record to 3-0 with the win. Building on their unbeaten streak they hope to carry the success the whole season especially in the upcoming conference games. “It’s great to be able to come into our PSAC games this week knowing we have three wins behind us already,” said junior midfielder Amanda Miller. “It gives us some extra confidence.”
The Pioneers will be on the road this weekend to face fellow PSAC members the Mercyhurst Lakers on Saturday and Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania on Sunday.
