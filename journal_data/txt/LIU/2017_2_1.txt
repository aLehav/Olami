Former tennis superstar and known feminist, Billie Jean King, spoke at the Tilles Center on Thursday, Jan. 26, and she brought us into the world of her historic tennis career, as well as spoke on other interesting topics. The Hillwood Recital Hall was full of sports fans and King’s admirers at 7:30 p.m. as they excitedly waited for the idol to walk on stage and address the crowd.
As early as age 12, King said to her mother, “Mom, I’m going to be the best player in the world.” This goal may have seen farfetched at the time, considering King didn’t even know what tennis was until she was introduced to the sport by fellow player Susan Williams. She asked King, “Do you play tennis?” and King replied, “What’s tennis?” It was at that moment King discovered what she wanted to dedicate her life to. After her first time on the court, she knew she loved the game.
There was more to tennis that mattered to King than the actual game. As King realized her potential, she also understood that she could be the catalyst to incite social change. She would say to herself, “Everyone who plays is white,” as she noticed commonalities in the athletes. “I was one of the lucky ones and I knew it.” She understood that she could play a big role in advancing women’s tennis, and she promised herself that she would “stay committed to fighting for equal rights for men and women.” The rights she fought for throughout her career were not guaranteed, although many men and women take them for granted for today. In a 1968 ruling, the British Lawn Tennis Association decided that both prize and amateurs could play for prize money. Most would think this was a win for feminism and equality, but that couldn’t be further from the truth, especially when gender plays a major role in the money one can bring in from a win. After winning her first event under the implementation of the new rules, King was only awarded 750 British pounds, significantly less than the 2500 pounds that her male counterparts received.
One of the most notable obstacles that King and other female competitors faced throughout their careers was the right to compete in their own tournament. For years, the men went on their own tours, but women’s tennis was steadily gaining popularity. King knew that in order for her wishes to be fulfilled, she needed to use all of the leverage that the women had. After gathering all of the top female players in a hotel room, they signed their first major sponsorship deal with cigarette company Phillip Morris. Despite not endorsing cigarette smoking herself, she and the other athletes accepted what is now known as the “one dollar deal.” With an endorser on board and several of the top players on her side, King then formed the Women’s Tennis Association which drastically changed the landscape of women’s tennis. She proclaimed, “The women got all of the attention in 1973.”
One of the most memorable moments of King’s career was defeating Bobby Riggs. Riggs was a decorated tennis player himself and the best player in the world in 1946 and 1947. The tennis match between these stars was dubbed the “Battle of the Sexes.” King’s victory was a defining moment for female athletes all across the globe trying to fight the stigma that women’s sports were a lesser version of men’s. Defeating Riggs in September 1973 notified everyone that the women were here to play,  too. King and the other women athletes helped prove that they could be the star of the shows as well, with legions of fans cheering on both the male and female competitors. King joked that she had to beat Riggs because she “respected him.”
Senior arts management major, Michaella Browne who is also a Tillis Center employee, attended the conversation with Billie Jean King. Browne was anxious to hear King speak as she looks up to her for being a “groundbreaking woman in tennis” and other aspects of life. She mentions, “I like feminist ideals she stands for… she’s a great role model for young girls.” After King’s discussion, Browne said she “was surprised by how vital she was to the forming of the WTA.”
Sophomore tennis player and forensics and psychology major, Shanice Arthur, was also excited to listen to Billie Jean King. “I didn’t know she was that involved in equal rights for everyone,” Arthur said. “It’s kind of incredible how she takes her time and spends her own to make sure that everyone is treated equally.”

After graduation many students do not have the right connections, experience, or qualifications that employers are looking for in that first entry-level job. How can graduates expect to land a job that offers a decent salary with benefits? Olivia Wicik, a 2013 Post alumna, returned to campus on Thursday, Jan. 26 to share her post-graduation experiences and advice to Communications students. She walked journalism, public relations and other majors through the important steps of networking based on her own success in a lunchtime lecture held in Humanities Hall during common hour. Wicik, who now works as global people and development coordinator at Ralph Lauren, began her career as a news desk associate at CBS News Radio.
The first step in getting the job, Wicik said, is to have experience. She stressed the importance of taking advantage of the opportunities on campus to gain experience. “Take advantage of being a student.” Internships, taking extra credits in your field of study, or working unpaid jobs are great ways of building up a portfolio and experience that recruiters are looking for, according to Wicik.
Wicik’s work while she was a journalism major as the Editor-in-Chief of The Pioneer, the News Editor at WCWP, and the editor of Upstart magazine during her study abroad in Australia helped her land her first job at CBS News Radio after graduation. Wicik described it as “not a very glamorous job” working for CBS. The nights were long and the deadlines were short. Fact-checking became a code to live by. “There was really no room for mistakes,” Wicik said.
The second step, Wicik advised, is to build connections. The more people you know within your industry, the more opportunities available for you to move up the ladder to bigger and better things. Wicik cited LinkedIn as a great source for networking and meeting new people. She demonstrated how to use LinkedIn to find jobs and connections.
Wicik moved from CBS to Ralph Lauren, where she began as a Business Systems Analyst and then became a Talent Acquisition Coordinator. Her job was to recruit product developers for the company. LinkedIn was the number one tool used for finding resumes.
“Make a list of places that you want to work,” she said, and follow them on social media.
“Whenever you meet anyone who can give you advice or connect you to a job, go for it, ask questions, make connections,” Wicik encouraged students.
The third step is to follow your passion. “Be realistic when following your passion,” Wicik said. “Sometimes it means following it after 9-5.”
Now as the global people and development coordinator (human resources) at Ralph Lauren, Wicik does not let her role define what she does in her job. Going back to her journalism roots, she has used her transferable skills of communication and writing to publish newsletters of employee engagement, and work on “passion projects” for the company.

Three residential buildings have closed to students on campus for spring semester. SGA Vice President, Adam Hornbuckle confirmed that both Nassau Hall and Suffolk Hall are closed along with the green SRC building this semester.

“The Student Government has been informed that Suffolk and Nassau are closed due to low housing enrollment,” Hornbuckle said. He included that though the SRC building is closed to students it is being used for groups like aupairs and conferences. Resident Assistants did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about their knowledge to dorm closures and representatives of the office of Public Safety would not answer any questions on the matter.
Students who live on campus noticed the closure. Cassidy Nelson, a sophomore musical theater major, and Holly Cignoretti, a junior fashion major, both said that Nassau Hall and Suffolk Hall are closed, but all other residential halls remain active. Freshman musical theater major Andrew Teperdijan said he has seen        non-students going into Suffolk Hall.
According to the school’s website, Nassau Hall was meant for students who lived on campus for 10 months, such as international students, those who worked on campus, or those who attended winter classes. Though inactive, the site still states that Suffolk Hall is a “traditional-style hall designed for intensified study for students who prefer a quiet, academic-centered environment, and graduate students.” Hornbuckle confirmed that Brookville, Post, Riggs, Queens, and Kings residential halls as well as SRC gold, a 21+building remain open at this time.
“Campus life is looking into making small improvements to the buildings while they are closed,” Hornbuckle said. Campus life would not provide any other comments in regards to their plans for the building during their closures.

When students returned for the spring semester, they saw small flags on the great lawn, marking the area where a new sprinkler system will be installed on campus.
“We will be installing a new irrigation sprinkler system on the great lawn and the area in front of Humanities where we have installed new walk ways,” Director of Facilities Services William Kirker said.
This installation is needed to keep the lawn from burning during the hot, dry months of summer, though this has never been an issue before. Fire demonstrations have been done on the lawn in the past, which caused some damage according to Fire Safety Officer Mike Conklin. “Keeping the grass green cuts down from fires,” Conklin said.
Three weeks into the second semester and the renovation to the paths on campus are also still underway. Due to inclement weather, the projects were postponed until the conditions improved. Mass piles of dirt remain next to these newly placed walkways and areas of overturned earth. Alongside the edges of the great lawn is suspected to be the new sprinkler system. Facilities Services did not clarify.
“I honestly don’t understand why [the renovations] would take so long with the amount of workers I’ve seen working on it,” broadcasting major Paul Evans, said. “They should hire a more experienced or dependable crew.”
Last semester, Kirker told The Pioneer the labor for the renovations came from a number of local firms based on a competitive bidding process. He did not disclose the names of any of the firms.
“We are working on finishing up certain paths on campus [and] we will be starting others to continue to keep the campus not only looking good, but also safe for our students and community,” Kirker continued. Facilities Services did not give an estimated end date for the renovations.

Four graduate students in the digital game design and development program developed a game called Side Slider, released in the iTunes App Store and Google Play Store on Dec. 12. The game was developed by a team made up by Eric Guadara, Ryan Cantar, Gerard Gilmartin and Felicia Cheng Zhang.
Side Slider encompassed an entire semester’s work in a class called “The Games Industry,” taught by Ramiro Corbetta, an assistant professor of digital game design and development. “The Games Industry is a graduate class that tasks students to create, release, and make money on a game or else fail,” Guadara, a second year graduate student in the program, said. While both teams in the class were not required to create games specifically made for iTunes, they felt it would be easier than developing games for a Mac or PC due to the longer development process.
Going through the entire process from inception to release of a game is very important, according to Andrew Wallace, an assistant professor of digital game design and development. “While learning how to create a game is vital, students need to leave Post with some understanding of how to market and release a game as well, which is the purpose of that class,” he said.
The Side Slider game was initially “just a game about tapping certain-sided shapes within a time limit,” Guadara said. “We wanted something that was simple, that we could make, and we also wanted to have thumping beats as a backdrop.” But, Professor Corbetta suggested that the game was too simple and that the students add another layer to it. “Sliding was the next most popular input we could think of, so then we had the slide to subtract mechanic. Eventually, we intertwined them and got the basis of what is released today,” Guadara explained.
Guadara has created 14 other digital games, including Beginner’s Guide to Chanting, and Pelt ‘Em, which he created during the Global Game Jam in 2016 and 2017. He has also created several board and card games in the game program at Post, including Highlandia, a hex-based tactical board game. “I worked with professor Winn Rea in the art/sculpture department to 3D print the pieces to the game,” he said.
Guadara likes that the digital game design and development program has a strong focus on creating games. The Side Slider game went through 10 versions before going through Apple’s certification process to be sold on the iTunes app store, “We tested eight versions of the Android game from Nov. 21 through Dec. 5, when the game went public,” Guadara said.
The easiest part of Side Slider’s development cycle for Guadara was creating the game’s 25-minute soundtrack, even though it took around 20 hours to complete. While making the soundtrack might have been fun for Guadara, creating the tutorial was a completely different experience.
“There was a full month span where I would ‘fix’ the tutorial, come to class with it, and watch as people had no clue how to play the game. I’d then get a long list of pointers from Professor Corbetta and add them, only to find that once implemented, they weren’t as effective as we thought they’d be.” Guadara and his classmates also found releasing the game on iTunes difficult. Due to Apple’s high standards for developers, Side Slider could only be released once it was completely free of glitches.
The experience of creating the game was “incredibly valuable” for Guadara. “It means so much in this industry to see a project from beginning to end. The last 10 percent of the work was so, so difficult, but the whole Side Slider team was great to work with, so we got through it. I’m very proud of what we created and the fact that we created it,” he added.
Side Slider is available to download for free on the iTunes app store and the Google Play store. While the reviews have been great, the game has not made a lot of money because it has not reached $100 in ad revenue, Guadara said. “I learned a lot throughout the development of Side Slider. The biggest lesson might have been the fact that marketing is hard and that promoting a mobile game requires a lot of money being put down in order to be successful.”

Noticed the cameras positioned around campus during the second week of the semester? Ish Entertainment and Keshet Studios are bringing the hit YouTube series “My Gay Roommate” to television with the setting of LIU Post campus. Based on the real life stories of Tufts University roommates, Noam Ash and Austin Bening, “My Gay Roommate” (MGR) follows the story of their friendship, despite their differing sexual orientations.
Pilot episode filming began on Saturday, Jan. 21 and continued until Tuesday night. Most cast members are well known actors within the New York theater community. Approximately 100 Post students were hired as extras for cafeteria and party scenes. Scenes were filmed in the Hillwood dining area, Nassau and South Resident Green Halls, the Lecture Hall in Hillwood and the Chapel.
“We had to do a whole bunch of takes of this scene even though it was very simple,” Adam Silverstein, social work major, said. He and approximately 25 other students filmed a cafeteria scene in Hillwood. “It really made us realize how much time and work goes into producing episodes of TV shows.”
After shooting the scenes, the extras signed permission slips and were rewarded with free pizza. Silverstein and a few extras had the chance to sit and talk with one of the producers for the show. “It was a very fun and interesting experience and I’m looking forward to seeing the completed pilot,” he said.
So what makes LIU Post the perfect setting? “The story is based on a quintessential, New England type college campus,” Jasmine Vargas, production manager for the pilot shoot, said. “The staff is great to work with, and it helps that [LIU] has done TV before,” she continued.
In the past LIU Post has had the independent films “Adrift;” “Independents;” “Captain of the Land of Tomorrow;” TV shows such as NBC’s “Blindspot;” TBS’s “The Detour;” CBS’s “Madame Secretary” and “Hostages and “The Rewrite” movie with Hugh Grant and Marisa Tomei, filmed on campus, according to Associate Director of Conference Services Kathy Mendall, who oversees many of the projects.
The story began in Boston, Mass. Ash and Bening became close friends during their college years together. Friends of Ash described their relationship similar to “an old married couple.” Because Ash was gay, his friends assumed he had a crush on his straight roommate.
“Despite Tufts being a liberal and open college, there was still speculation,” said Ash, the now 25 year old star and writer for MGR. During their college years, Ash said, “That a gay guy and a straight guy could be best friends still seemed novel.”
Both Ash and Bening wrote the script and acted in the show for the web series, but only Ash will be starring in the tv series. Bening assisted in writing the pilot script, but has moved on to other projects.
‘My Gay Roommate’ began in Nov. 2012 and ended in its third season on YouTube two years ago. Hollywood Vanity Fair magazine announced in an interview with Ash and Bening in Feb. 2016 that the show was receiving offers by premium online networks.
“Right now we are filming the pilot, then we have to find out where to air it,” said Ash. Ash has been living with this show for five years in the hopes of it reaching a major entertainment network. It is a dream come true to see it air on TV.
“It’s a part of the revolution to bring gay to TV,” Ash said. But the story is set in a post-revolution era. “There are two male leads – one is gay and one is straight – and that’s the two least interesting things about them,” he said.

The LIU University libraries introduce the new Digital Commons repository to students via university email. The digital repository will act as a base to share and save works by students and faculty. Chosen compositions will be highlighted and placed in a Special Collections and Archives section. According to the email, compositions will include journal articles, working papers, technical reports, campus publications, university documents, conference papers, presentations, dissertation abstracts, images and videos. The materials in the Digital Commons will be available, free of charge, to the entire world.
The repository will be administered by LIU University libraries. The software is hosted by a company called bepress. It was added to LIU as a way to highlight student scholarship library faculty and repository coordinator Natalia Tomlin said. There is a great chance of searching for material and it being brought up through Google. “Repository content is indexed in major search engines such as Google.” Uniquely, readers are able to see where on the globe other readers are viewing documents through the Earth map at the bottom of the home page.
Chloe Margulis, a computer science graduate of the Honors College, was able to see that her senior thesis was viewed nearly 40 times throughout the world. Margulis’ mathematical thesis, The Application of Big Data Analytics to Patent Litigation is one of the five original pieces uploaded so far to the Digital Commons. According to Tomlin, Margulis’ work was viewed in the America, Canada, France, Japan, and Switzerland. “In a year or so, this student could possibly have her name cited in someone’s research.”
Now that the repository is available, any student interested publishing his or her work in the Digital Commons can do so with the approval of a faculty member. A Member Approval Form, found on the homepage of the Digital Commons site, must be filled out by the student and a faculty member of their choice to obtain permission to post. Work can be submitted to the repository by uploading a typed document or scanning a written document. Images and videos may also be uploaded. Once uploaded, authors receive an email with submission status with a URL for work to be accessed and shared through social media, professional profiles, and especially digital portfolios.
The Digital Commons became a thought to the University in November of 2015 as part of the LIU 2020 Strategic Plan developed by faculty and administrators. Local schools such as Hofstra Law School, Stony Brook, and St. Joseph’s have Digital Commons whereas Adelphi, Nassau, and Farmingdale State do not. Officially, the platform became accessible to LIU in fall of 2016 and is now open for student publishing. There will be an instructional video on the main page of the Digital Commons site for understanding how to upload. According to the email, faculty members will be invited to an information session to learn about the repository and ways they can contribute as resources. “The more active [LIU Digital Commons] is the more Google hits it will receive,” Tomlin said. The Digital Commons can be accessed by logging onto digitalcommons.liu.edu.

While some students work in the student run businesses on campus, Samantha Samant, a sophomore theater major, has created and runs her own business, Fairy Godmother Face Painting, outside of Post.
She started Fairy Godmother Face Painting in Sept. 2016 to provide entertainment for birthday parties, classroom visits, festivals, and corporate groups in the Long Island area. Along with face painting, the business offers glitter tattoos, balloon animals, a swimming mermaid, coronations, and meet-and-greets with Disney princesses.
Samant has been an actor for seven years. Her first show was “Twelfth Night” at the Usdan Performing Arts camp. She believes that performing for children will sharpen her acting skills. Children are the hardest audience to please. “They notice every detail,” she said.
Samant, who runs the business on her own, will be collaborating with playwright Elizabeth Kotite to create new Disney-like stories for the business. Samant is also searching for a composer to create original music to accompany the stories, and for actors to join her team.
With any business comes responsibilities, including insurance. Samant’s parents were supportive of her business, and assisted in setting it in motion. They contributed funds for the insurance for the company. “This is most important, especially with working with kids. You want to be covered for any accidents that could happen to the children or yourself,” Samant said. It is important to have the right kind of insurance, Samant advises to those who wish to start a business that deals with children, a policy that will cover everything.
“Don’t be afraid to ask questions while working in this field, because 9 out of 10 times, the question that you didn’t ask will be where you trip up,” Samant said.
