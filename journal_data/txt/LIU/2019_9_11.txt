 The merger between the Brooklyn Blackbirds and the Post Pioneers has come into effect beginning with the fall season sports. With more than 170 years of athletic history combined between the Brooklyn and Post campuses, the univer-sity announced last fall the merger be-tween the two athletic departments into one Division I program. The fall sports teams have made their first official com-petition appearances as the LIU Sharks.
The women’s soccer team was the first Sharks team to compete as they travelled to California to take on the University of San Diego on August 23 and San Diego State University on August 26. The games ended with 0-3 and 0-1 respective losses. Since returning from the west coast, the team recorded two additional losses against Army West Point and Fairfield University and one win against Seton Hall University. 
While the women’s team struggled, the men’s soccer team started their season with greater success. They won their first two games on the road against Old Dominion University and Virginia Commonwealth University with the scores of 2-1 and 1-0 respectively.
Both the men’s football team and the women’s field hockey team are estimated to be underdogs this season. Neither of these two sports were in competition at the Division I level in Brooklyn the previous year. The women’s field hockey team lost their first three games, only scoring one goal in total. 
The Post Pioneers’ football team went undefeated in the regular season last year and won the Northeast 10 conference. Entering into the Division I ring could prove to be tough. The Sharks’ first game, which took place on the road against the South Dakota State Jack Rabbits, ended with a 38-3 loss. This was the first time in the history of LIU that the team travelled west of the Mississippi River for a match-up. 
When it comes to the players this season, head football coach Bryan Collins knew early on he wanted his transfer recruit from Iowa Western Community College Clay Beathard to be his starting quarterback. Collins expects many players, such as defensive linemen Able Joseph and receiver Derek Eugene to pick up the heavy load left behind from his impactful senior class from last year.  
The game did not go as planned for the Sharks. The first quarter was a very strong defensive standing by both teams, and the first score didn’t come until about 11 minutes into the game, when South Dakota quarterback Kanin Nelson rushed two yards into the end zone for the game’s first touchdown. The Sharks continued to fight and were the next to score as kicker Brian Defelice knocked through the 27-yard field goal bringing the score to 7-3 with 9:50 left to go in the half. 
The next score was the absolute turning point of the game. With a 4th and 6 coming up, the Sharks punted the ball away to the Jack Rabbits with Jaxon Janke on the receiving end, who returned the punt 77 yards for the Jack Rabbits touchdown, bringing the score to 14-3 with 4:24 left to go in the half. The Jack Rabbits did not look back, as they would score two more rushing touchdowns. They would also score on a 34-yard passing touchdown immediately following an interception thrown by the Sharks’ quarterback Clay Beathard.   
With 8:48 left to go in the game, the Jack Rabbits ensured their win with a 22-yard field goal making the score 38-3.  
This loss was not expected from an undefeated team in 2018, however, the competition will be much greater this year. The Sharks can take much away from this game and use it as motivation for the rest of the season.

 Two former students from the film department, Justin Portaro (‘18) and Kat Gueli, attended several film festivals over the summer and won a number of awards. 
“We did one [film festival] in Texas called the 52nd Houston World Fest,” Portaro said. Participants submitted their original films in hopes of winning an award. Afterwards, fewer films were screened. “Texas was about 4000 applicants then 300 awarded and 100 screened.” Portaro said. At this festival Portaro won the Gold Remi award for his film “Kid, the Moon.”  
“It’s cool because you get to network and meet different film makers in the field,” Gueli said about attending these festivals. “Festivals are a good way to network and have your film be seen by many different audiences.” 
Another festival the two attended was the Jersey Shore Film Festival where they each one an award. Portaro won Best Director of a Short Film, Gueli won Best Drama Short for her film “Heart and Soul.” 
The two spoke of how they got into film and pursuing the field. “I got an All County in photography, from [there] my friend asked me to film his short film, and from there I just kept going down that path.” Portaro said. Starting as a fine arts major, he soon switched to film, “I do film because I like being able to create something and share a story with people, it makes me feel good,” Portaro said.
Gueli came from a performing arts background. “I was heavily involved in theater throughout my life, then in high school I was asked to assist the director in the musical, and I fell in love with directing and connecting to people,” she said. She attributes her success to the professors who helped shape her college experience, including Suzan Zeig. “I love film because it gives me a purpose to feel everything that I do and experience and put it into work and make people connect to that something bigger than myself.” Gueli said. 
Gueli mentioned another festival, the Long Island Film Expo. “You are with a lot of your peers, meeting people who are very local and could get easy access to work on your films.” Gueli said. These types of festivals also exposed them to more professional work. “Being at a festival also allows you to see not just other student work but also people at all different levels so you learn from them and improve yourself.” Portaro said. 
The festivals themselves while having a similar setup are unique in the styles of art they present. “The Jersey Shore one was more indie and experimental, seeing my film there was with an audience that liked that type of film, so I got a unique response at that festival that I didn’t get at another festival.” Gueli said. 
The two highlighted the Jersey Shore film festival and had a positive experience overall. “At the Jersey shore film festival after my film, we talked about it for about 45 minutes, so it’s a good feeling that people don’t just want to watch it, but think about it longer then the run time,” Portaro said. 
“Jersey Shore Film Festival so far is the best one I’ve been to; the people that were there were so nice and so humble and so in love with the art that was being shared at the festival, I left there thinking I was part of this unique family.” Gueli said. 
Professor Lisa Robinson came across some of the festivals Gueli and Portaro attended. “[She] gave us a list of festivals that she thought would work best for us,” Portaro said. Inspiration is an important part of creating films and can come from many places from personal relationships to books and movies. 
“We see a lot of common themes, and it’s about taking those themes and making it personal to your own life experiences, and making it a little more intimate,” Gueli said. 
“Both films are about a parent and their child. They’re completely different but they have the same connection,” Portaro said. Both his and Gueli’s films in the coming of age genre. “We love when characters are finding themselves; that’s kind of where we are now, transitioning between college and trying to figure out what our next chapter is, and we just gravitate towards those films.” Gueli said. 
Gueli is screening her film “Heart and Soul” at the Golden Door Festival on September 19. A scene from Gueli’s film “Heart and Soul” can be found at https://vimeo.com/269282589. The trailer for Portaro’s film “Kid, the Moon” is also available online at https://vimeo.com/327858134.

 Welcome to a new semester as a college student. Maybe you just started your first year, or entered your last. Maybe you are somewhere in between. Regardless of who you are and what year you just started, there are some things I want to tell you. 
I could list fundamental actions that can lead to academic success, like attending classes, study the syllabus, get to the classroom prepared and take notes, but I won’t. Your professors and academic advisors will have that covered. I want to give you something else, something they might forget to tell you. So again, there are some things I want you to know. 
Number 1: College focuses a lot on performance, but remember, your academic achievements don’t define who you are, or what you are worth. Not understanding the lecture, doesn’t make you dumb. Not getting straight A’s doesn’t make you a failure. Don’t be too hard on yourself. People who really care about you won’t judge you based on performance.
Number 2: Don’t compare yourself to others. Everyone has different starting points and different goals. As long as you do everything you are capable of and feel good about where you are going, things will be fine. Number 3: Don’t be afraid to ask for help. To admit that you need support is not a sign of weakness, rather a sign of strength. There are plenty of resources on campus like the writing center, tutoring and counseling at the Center for Healthy Living. The Center for Healthy Living is located in Post Hall and open Monday-Friday between 9 a.m.-5 p.m. and the Writing Center is located in Humanities Hall, Room 223. 
Number 4: Focus on the things you can control and put the other things aside. For a very long time, and I still struggle sometimes, I was obsessed with pleasing people around me. I could sit for hours with homework assignments because I thought, if they weren’t perfect, my professors would be disappointed in me. I thought I had the power to control and read people’s thoughts and feelings. I couldn’t. Every time you feel stressed or worried about something, ask yourself the question: “Can I do something about this?” or “Can I control this?” If the answer is yes, take action. If the answer is no, let it go.
Number 5: Don’t be afraid to be alone sometimes. In a world where you can be connected with others at all times, it can be valuable to spend some time alone to get to know yourself; to be able to know what you want, what you need and what you feel. Quality time with yourself is valuable for your own growth.    
Number 6: Stress, worry and fear of not being or doing enough are just thoughts born inside your own head. Anxious thoughts will always appear, but don’t forget that they are just thoughts, a harmless fluffy cloud that won’t be real unless you react to them. If you manage to let the thoughts just pass, they will stay as harmless fluffy clouds.  
Finally, from one student to another, remember to be nice to yourself. Take school seriously to create a good foundation for your future, but don’t forget to take care of yourself along the way. We are only human. Listen to your body and mind. Eat, sleep and spend time with people who make you happy. Create time in your schedule to do things that energize you. Lastly, don’t be too hard on yourself. Practice thinking about yourself in a positive way. Be your best friend.

 Michael Berthel, former dean of students for Post since Sept. 17, 2017, was promoted to executive dean of students, which was announced via email to the LIU community in May 2019 by Joseph Schafer, the chief administrative officer. Berthel came to Post in 2013 as the associate director of the office of student life, reporting to then Dean of Students Abby Van Vlerah.
In the new position of Executive Dean of Students, Berthel will oversee student affairs for both the Post and Brooklyn campuses. He will spend a few days each week on each campus. The former Dean of Students for the LIU Brooklyn campus, Dr. Jessica Hayes, was promoted to the chief of staff for the University President Dr. Kimberly Cline.
The role is similar to his previous role as dean of students for Post. “It’s just adding the Brooklyn component to it,” Berthel said. “The conversations are how do we take these areas and make them both look similar and offer the same services. A student at Brooklyn should have the same services and advantages as a student at Post and vice versa.”
Berthel plans to increase the dialogue between students and faculty by being present on both the Brooklyn and Post campuses. He explained the contrast between the campuses. “I think it’s one of the things that makes LIU unique,” he said, referring to the campus in the heart of Long Island and the other in the heart of Brooklyn. To experience both campuses each week “is a really cool opportunity” for him, “so I get to see the full picture of what LIU is.”
Berthel studied at Adelphi University, where he received a B.A. in political science and government, a M.A. in industrial and organizational psychology, an advanced graduate certificate in human resources management. Before joining LIU, he was the Senior Assistant Director of the Center for Student Involvement at Adelphi from August 2012 to October 2013.“
Obviously, my main goal on campus is always to advocate for students,” to implement new programs that students want and to make students’ experiences enjoyable, a dynamic campus life,” he said in an interview with the Pioneer on June 19 about his new responsibilities.
In the spring 2019 semester, Berthel implemented a Dean’s Council and a Collaborative Initiative Team to have a dialogue and receive feedback from staff, faculty and students. ”We’ve been working with teams on both campuses together towards the ultimate goal of sort of creating one LIU experience.”
 One of the advantages to working with both campuses, Berthel noted, was that there are staff members on both campuses doing similar roles that can help each other and grow. They can talk to each other about day to day operations and techniques that they can share to improve and do better work overall.
One of the biggest challenges, he said, is “just making sure that I’m constantly hearing. I think other deans experience the same thing where we’re constantly talking with students, interacting with students, hearing what they want,” Berthel said. Because students are busy, Berthel stressed being “intentional” in your interactions, how you hear feedback, how you implement feedback. 
Last year, he held an Ask the Dean Series, during which he toured campus and spoke to students about their experiences on campus and where improvements can be made. He also held several lunches in the End Zone and created a Dean’s Council during which seven or eight students met every three weeks to talk about issues, challenges and new ideas.
Berthel noted the importance of asking students what they want. This allows for a middle ground for students and administrators to work comfortably together. Berthel plans to continue reaching out to students and engaging with students at traditional events like Home-coming and Holidays at Hillwood.
“I think tradition is great, but it doesn’t mean that you can’t make it better and improve upon it every year, and that’s the stuff that we want to do,” he said. 
Berthel’s Post office is located on the third floor of Hillwood Commons. 
Advertisements for a new Dean of Students – LIU Post and a new Dean of Students – LIU Brooklyn are posted on the university website. Janelle Owens is acting dean at Brooklyn and Jean Anne Smith is acting dean at Post.

 With the new semester comes new changes to the student center, Hillwood Commons. From office relocations and new stores, to colors and businesses, there is a wide range of things for returning students to get used to. 
The student run business Hutton and Post has been replaced with a new apparel store, Shark Nation, that sells merchandise depicting the new campus mascot, the Sharks. It is the updated version of Pioneer Nation. 
“We’re pretty confident that people are going to want to buy more school spirit stuff in order to sort of renew their wardrobe, so we thought we’d put [Shark Nation] in a more prominent spot that you can see when you walk in the building,” Michael Berthel, executive dean of students, said.
This new store is not the only new addition to Hillwood. The entrance itself has also been renovated. And when students walk in, they will notice the new blue paint surrounding locations like the concierge desk. 
There is a new Greek Life Center called the Pavilion, an Asian cuisine restaurant called Bamboo, a mini student gym called Bluefit that is equipped with Peloton bikes, and a new space for the ESports Arena.
Berthel helped direct the implementation of these new additions. The changes will allow for more activity diversity in the building, and will ensure Hillwood provides more to students as a center. 
“We really sat back and looked at where everything is situated, what makes the best use of space and we came up with a plan that would really create a more vibrant Hillwood Commons for the fall,” Berthel said. The Student Body Boutique has been moved to the first floor, where Pioneer Nation used to be located. The Bluefit bike studio is on the second floor in the Boutique’s old spot. 
Andrew Serken, a junior history major, is unsure about the renovations. “I do not think there was anything that needed renovations, except to switch color schemes to the new school colors,” Serken said. 
Student-run businesses will still be controlled by students in daily operations. According to Berthel, 50 percent of proceeds go back to students scholarship and 50 percent goes to building more student-run businesses. “[It’s purpose is] to continue to allow students to run businesses, help create new businesses and have experiential learning and that model is still very much the mission of the student run businesses,” Berthel said.
The old space that was occupied by the Promise Office is now a Greek Life center called the Pavilion. “Obviously Greek Life makes up a huge part of our campus life experience, so we really wanted to give them a dedicated space. That community has grown immensely over the last few years by design,” Berthel said. The space will be used as a meeting room, a place to have events, and for students to study with fellow fraternities and sororities. 
As chapter for most greek organizations take place on Monday, Former Director of Greek Life and Student Involvement, Joseph Vernace doesn’t see the space being a common setting for these meetings. “I think what’s really going to be the most bookable space is that board room, and that will all be bookable through our office. But in terms of all the organizations booking chapter rooms, that’ll still be through that Astra system,” he said. August 23 was Vernace’s final day as director, and Jessica Rappaport will take over as director of Greek Life and student involvement.
Greek Life students will have swipe access with their LIU ID cards to gain access to the Pavillion. Though there are plans to open the space to the entire campus community during the fall semester, according to Vernace. “Every December we have an annual tradition, it’s our Post Goes Greek Day,” Berthel said.
Other changes on the second floor include new furniture for the lounge area, along with a restructuring of the plaza at the front entrance of Hillwood.  
“While I think Hillwood becoming more activity-focused is good and needed, due to a lack of student activity on the weekends, I do not feel like another gym is the correct option, especially since its replacing the store that had student-designed clothes.” Students will swipe their card when they check in with a student worker at the Bluefit desk to use the Peloton bikes. 
Another change is the Esports arena moving next to the Pavilion on the second floor, allowing the team for more space and better computers and other equipment, according to Berthel. Serken thinks the area might be too big for the team. As far as food is concerned, Twisted Taco has been replaced with Asian cuisine restaurant, Bamboo, offering things like sushi and bubble tea. As a student, Serken prefers sushi to what Twisted Taco served, so he looked forward to the change. “If anything, Bamboo should be a more affordable or more reasonable package for students than Twisted Taco.” 
Berthel explained that one of the reasons Twisted Taco is now removed was because of how expensive it was. Even though Bamboo will serve sushi, the sushi station will still be present in the Hillwood Cafe. Aramark employees will continue to work in the restaurants and food venues on campus.

 When students need to meet with their success coaches, they’ll have to trek up an extra flight of stairs. The Promise Office in Hillwood Commons moved to the third floor on August 7, a transition timed alongside other new renovations in Hillwood. The new location has more office space and a patio.
“We wanted to give a place where students could congregate, [and] come for a variety of different reasons, [to] eat, hangout, study, [and] participate in student campus life,” Michael Berthel, executive dean of students, said. There are elevators leading to the third floor and navigational signs throughout Hillwood.
Promise staff members such as Berthel, Jean Anne Smith and Ashley John, manage campus life, resident assistants and orientation proceedings. Their presence in Hillwood Commons allows for students to have better access to them with the high foot traffic in the area. 
Andrew Serken, a junior history major, was not enthusiastic about the decision. “I’m not really happy with the move. I think it was in a perfect place, and I am unsure where it is currently located, which I’m sure will cause confusion,” he said. “Old promise was just so easy to get to.” 
“It’s a part of the bigger plan,” Berthel said. “This is a larger area, it gives us opportunities for some more student programming, it creates a little bit more of an open space for us to put all the coaches and the staff together.” The outdoor patio will be used for student events. The Promise Office’s previous location has been repurposed for a space called the Pavillion, which will focus on Greek Life.
“For us, moving an office out of the second floor so we can give it back to students is just a no brainer,” Berthel said. “People are going to come see Promise and their success coach no matter where they are.”  
Serken suggested that the Pavillion and similar spaces should be opened for clubs to host events. The Promise office’s new location might be beneficial as long as it is easily accessible and more coaches are hired, according to Serken.
“It was part of a collective brainstorming about Hillwood and how to make improvements to the building,’’ Berthel said on the decision to move Promise. The office has moved before within the last six years, having previously been situated in the Winnick mansion. However,  growing staff necessitated a move to wider space. “When it [Promise] first started, there were maybe five counselors, and its grown every time as more students come in,” Berthel said.  “We came to Hillwood which we thought was much more appropriate because it’s a student center, where students were at.”
Promise held a Welcome Back event on Sept. 4 in the new office space on the third floor to let students know of the change in location. Food was offered and students had the opportunity to adjust to the new environment. As for the old location, the Pavillion will be open only for Greek Life and those interested in Greek Life and will have the same operating hours as Hillwood.

 I am a freshman here at LIU Post, pursuing a B.S. in music. I had been planning on attending this school for a significant amount of time. Since hearing of this university’s music department, I attended an open house, had a private lesson or two with music faculty, spoken with cur-rent students and alumni, and even attended the “Exclusive President’s Dinner.” The vague “Only a select number of students have been chosen for this opportunity, and you are one of them!” mentioned in the invitation seemed like a cheap tactic made in an attempt to evoke feelings of uniqueness and individuality from students. Something about the dinner felt cold and impersonal. The dean I’d met with relayed false claims to me, which began to stir my suspicions and negative feelings toward this university.
Since my junior year of high school, I was dead-set on attending this school for a B.M. in music performance. My lengthy experience and time spent on this campus weaved a strong emotional connection to Post for me. I thought it strange that a private school with an insanely inclusive eighty-three percent acceptance rate (in comparison to their SUNY neighbors) could leave me with such a powerful sentiment of love and eagerness. My burning desire to escape the restrictive clutches of my high school was fueled by the promise which lay ahead at LIU Post.
When I received my acceptance letter on the cloudy afternoon of Wednesday, December 12, I saw the “You will look good in green and gold,” and I immediately burst into a fit of happy tears. I stood there, basking in a feeling of victory, still aware of the fact that this was a uni-versity with a more than non-competitive acceptance rate.
The following day, I got off the bus and went of the LIU Post website. The music department’s option for “B.M. Music Performance” disappeared. The degree I had anticipated pursuing for so long had vanished. Rumors declaring that the performance degree would be terminated were true. Current students had been telling me not to worry; they told me that a “stay” had been put on the performance degree, and that Post wouldn’t be seeing a fall in the music department for at least another ten or fifteen years. The pessimistic and unreputable voices spreading rumors had been correct.
Since my dedication to this school was so strong, I still decided to attend the school. Rather than changing my area of study entirely, I merely chose to pursue a B.S. in music– a much broader and less intense degree. For now, this was okay, for I had been told that the perfor-mance degree was “under construction.”
One random day in May, I opened up Instagram, and one of the Post accounts on my feed had cursed my day with the image of sharks swimming under a rising sun. The caption told me that we were now the LIU sharks, boasting brand new colors of a weak blue and an overpowering gold. No longer would I “look good in green and gold,” and no longer was I a member of “Pioneer Nation.” This was not the school that I signed up to obtain a higher education from.
This was a school that was setting fire to the widely pursued degrees, the arts, the careers of Division II athletes, job positions, beloved traditions, and much more. This was not a school welcoming me with open arms. It was an artificial, accepting, and promising place on the outside; on the inside, it was something of a ruthless lumberjack. It was a lumberjack deforesting the beloved trees and ponds which composed LIU Post in a cheap attempt to build a mall (a Division I school) and ultimately reel in more revenue than ever before. Of course, this approach is counterintuitive. From the outside looking in, it seemed that students were silent on the matter of the abrupt rebranding (although it is not commonly known that this was a conspiracy long in the making). I am now aware of the protesting voices that have been silenced with empty — yet heavy — threats. Why violently eradicate colors, mascots, and other customs which people had loved so much? Not only will it will continue to drain this place of morale, but I am sure that it has also cost a fortune to splash an underwhelming shade of blue on every ex-green sign, door-way, booth, shuttle stop, you name it, on campus. Scholarships I had been promised were not given to me, yet the school has not batted an eyelash when it comes to dumping money into non-sensible “assets.”
I have not been here for very long at all, though the tired rhetoric the administration has been feeding the student body is getting old. Our voices will not continue to be drowned out. We, the student body, the audience which the administration’s purpose is to serve, are here, and we will be heard.

 University President Kimberly Cline’s new chief of staff is a face many LIU students and alumni will recognize. Former dean of students for the Brooklyn campus, Dr. Jessica Hayes became the new chief of staff at the end of the spring 2019 semester. 
In an email to the LIU com-munity on May 7, Chief Administrative Officer John Schaefer announced that Hayes would as-sume the role of Chief of Staff and University Relations. In the same email, it was announced that Post campus Dean of Students Micheal Berthel was promoted to Executive Dean of Students for both the Post and Brooklyn campus. 
“Jessica Hayes is intelligent, hard-working and committed to LIU,” Cline said in an email to The Pioneer. “She is a great example of someone who graduated from LIU, started her career at the University, and proceeded to perform well, eventually earning her position as Chief of Staff. She is an asset and I appreciate all she does each day to make LIU better.”
As chief of staff, Hayes is responsible for day to day operations of the president’s office and ensures the university is on track of their strategic plan. Through the university relations role, Hayes contributes to projects such as the Sanford Institute, which works with elementary schools in California to roll out social emotional learning philosophy programs; and the Theodore Roosevelt Institute, which provides valuable resources and archives of President Roosevelt’s prolific writings, including journal entries and letters and is a part of the new School for Professional Studies at LIU. 
“These projects are exciting as they allow me to continue to build upon our strategic university partnerships,” Hayes said. Her role is “amazing, incredible,” and there is something new everyday. 
“For so many years I’ve worked wanting to help make LIU a better, stronger place. I’ve done that on the front lines with students on the campus and now I have an opportunity to expand the way in which I make students’ lives better,” she shared. 
Hayes is aiming for success in her new role, crediting her long history with LIU as a foundation that gives her a macro-view of the entire operations of the university. 
Hayes has been a member of the LIU community since her undergraduate years. A student-athlete from Northport, Long Island, Hayes played field hockey as a Post Pioneer while earning her degree in speech language pathology. In 1994, she decided to be a resident assistant and spent two years in that role. “Life changed for me,” Hayes said. “That [being an RA] really transformed my career path in a way that I didn’t even know, because they didn’t even have a degree in Higher Ed back then. I really fell in love with Higher Ed and working on a college campus.”
After graduation, Hayes had the opportunity to be a residence hall director. She was in charge of Riggs Hall and worked fulltime while she pursued her masters in school counseling. 
Every two years, Hayes was offered another opportunity to rise in the ranks at LIU. She held several positions across resident life and housing while completing her doctorate in education leadership. Before moving to the Brooklyn campus five years ago, Hayes served as Associate Dean of Students at Post under then Dean of Students Abby Van Vlerah.
“I’ve got 16 years experience at Post, five at Brooklyn, and a love and passion for LIU,” Hayes said. “Altogether it brings me in the right place to be able to help moveus forward and make us a national teaching institution, trying to elevate our academic reputation and make this a destination where students want to be. What better work to do than that everyday?”
Hayes doesn’t find her new job to consist of extra work or stress. “When you find something you’re passionate about, it doesn’t feel like it’s more work it feels like opportunity and excitement,” she said. “I’m made to work hard I think it’s not hard, it’s being persistent, consistent and positive. Those are my strengths. It’s vigorous, so we have to put good work in to make sure we’re going to get results for students, but that feels exciting to me.”
Dr. Hayes’s new office is located in Bush Brown Hall at University Center. But she tries to go to campus as much as possible to see students. She attended move-in, orientation, welcome back and convocation for both campuses this semester. “It’s like Game Day. You see students yell and scream and be excited, to me that feels like it’s what it’s all about,” she said.
For students both old and new coming to campus this semester, Hayes leaves this advice: have a mentor. One of the keys to her success has been through mentorship. “When I speak to students I always ask them, do you have a mentor? Have someone in your life that you can reason things out with, that can help with decision making. When you know you’re not alone, it’s so much easier. Knowing you’re not alone and finding a mentor is critical.” 
Gabrielle Bernadotte, who graduated in August 2019 with an M.S. in speech language pathology, worked under Dr. Hayes as an RA and recalled how uplifting she was. “She made those long and hard-working days worth it. She really became a mentor I could speak to about things besides school,” she said.
Hayes makes herself a resource to every student and encourages students to reach out to her before they actually need her. “Let me get to know you before you need me, because then when you need me, you’ll come get me. But if you only know me when you need me, it limits our ability. If I can be that support for you, sign me up.”

 As another school year begins, a new crop of students prepared to begin their college journey. These students, who all came from many different places and have many different goals, have one thing in common: they have entered LIU as the class of 2023. 
Students who live on campus moved into the dorms on August 29, and they prepared to begin their first year of university life. “I’m really excited to study the thing that I love and focus on that, whereas [in] highschool you are told what classes you have to take,” BrayLynn Willis, a freshman musical theater major, said. 
As students settled into their new residence halls they also had a chance to explore the campus and all it has to offer. “I think the campus is really nice,” Ethan Sanft, a freshman childhood education major said. “Originally I wasn’t going to go local because I thought a lot of local schools had, a road going through them, but this campus feels really secluded and nice.” 
Students who will be dorming will also be experiencing a big change in their lives as they begin living on their own. “I’m so excited to be able to live on my own and have freedom, and go to bed when I want, and be able to start making decisions for myself and be more responsible,” Nessa Randazzo, a freshman secondary education major said. “I’m away from home, but at the same time I’m only an hour away,” Adriel Williams Jr., a freshman dual business administration and data analytics major, said. “If there is an emergency I can return home, but I feel excited. I’m getting ready to explore life on my own.”
The freshmen weren’t the only ones excited about moving in. RA’s greeted incoming students as they entered their dorms for the first time. “Being in a freshman dorm really brings it back home,” Vanessa Gardner, a senior photography major, said. “I literally just went upstairs and talked to a parent for a good five minutes about all my freshmen move in stories. It’s an interesting experience being a freshman RA.”
The Alumni committee was also present to help students move in and get situated on campus. Sherlyn Ortiz-Suarez, a member of the Alumni committee, and a graduate of the class of 2000, thinks that events like Move In Day help students feel like they have support. “This is kind of a way of us showing the new students that are coming in that we are here and pres-ent, and that we do have a strong Alumni board here,” Suarez said. “We know that this kind of day can kind of be overwhelming, and sort of confusing, so we’re just here to show our presence on campus.”
With the freshmen class now moved into their dorms and ready to begin their new col-lege life, a new school year awaits all students at LIU.
