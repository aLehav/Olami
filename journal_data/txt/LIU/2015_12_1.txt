Dr. James Freeley has been a professor at Post in the School of Management for the past 35 years. He currently teaches Organizational Behavior, Creating and Managing a Small Business, and Management Seminar. Along with teaching management courses, he also started a graduate program in Social Entrepreneurship. The program requires MBA students to “give back to society” by becoming consultants to local non-profit organizations and assisting them to become efficient in serving the needs of society.
Freeley has studied the characteristics of successful entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs on Long Island. “You can come up with a great idea that works, but do you have the characteristics to take that great idea and move forward?” Freeley said. “You want to surround yourself with people who are strong in the areas you are weak in.” Freeley said that everyone should have a basic understanding of business, no matter what his or her career may be. “You have to be acquainted with marketing. A lot of entrepreneurs get so in love with their idea that they never ask the question: is there a market for the product? And if there’s a market: can I make a profit?”
“We live in an ever changing world and there are so many layers to business, both [locally] and globally. Having the ability to understand even the basics can open your eyes and your mind,” said Amy Brown, a freshman business administration major.
Freeley has had his entrepreneurship research featured on USA Today Online, Entrepreneur, and in a 2004 article of the New York Times. He has written a book, titled “Are You an Entrepreneur?” and has created a series of video documentaries in which he interviews CEOs, such as the CEO of JetBlue, and uncovers how they became successful. In his videos, he analyzes the thinking of successful entrepreneurs, and who they were before they became successful. “I wanted to get inside the thinking of the entrepreneur,” Freeley said. “Other people can watch the video and get a real sense of who and what this person is all about. What is their thinking? Why did they get into the business.”
The idea behind the documentaries was to find out the “nitty gritty,” “beyond Google” information. “One of the CEOs on Long Island said ‘growing up, I was so poor. I had to sleep on the kitchen floor.’ When you Google them, you don’t find out they had to sleep on the kitchen floor.” “My hope is to expose students to the idea that you can start your own business; that you don’t necessarily need to graduate and then go directly to work for a large corporation,” he said.
“It’s interesting to see where these people have come from and how they achieved their success,” said Jason Lampkin, a junior business major. “The documentaries go to show that you don’t need a Harvard degree to be successful; you just have to have a good idea and be willing to put in the hard work.”
“Dr. Freeley makes you think,” Brown said. “His class is an open forum for which everyone is involved. He’s made me look at life, work, business in a way that has me asking different questions and pay more attention to how things in business are structured and why.”
“You’re living in an entrepreneurial society,” Freeley said. “But in the media, it’s all large companies. So I say to my students, ‘okay its all-large companies, but if you trace them back, they all start with one person in their garage.’ Walt Disney: garage. Walter Grumman: garage. Steve Jobs and Wozniak: in a garage. Yes, we’re in a big business environment, but most of the companies today were started by entrepreneurs in a garage.”
As for the key to success, Freeley said, “We all come with certain skills, certain cultural backgrounds; if you work hard and keep learning with the idea that you work hard, eventually it will be beneficial for you.” “But luck determines what happens and what goes on,” he added. “It is an important factor in achieving success.”

Alex Lynn, a junior maths/physics major, sat by the bar-like chairs just outside of the Starbucks glass doors, casually leaning over the counter, her legs free-flowing in the air. She smiles. “Having one of these performances in front of your friends really kicks you to do well, because they know you,” Lynn said. “If you make a mistake it’s a little more embarrassing.”
The Sydney-native has turned a beloved hobby into a potential career, and is now throwing up flyers all over campus to make her fellow Post peers aware of what’s to come.
When Lynn returned home over the summer, A&R Records, an independent music publishing company from Australia, liked one of her new songs, and offered to do a single release with her next year. The only catch: the cost of following through with the proposal would cost approximately $2,000.
”The thing with independent labels is that they don’t record for you, and there’s nothing free really, so you kind of have to give in what you give out,” Lynn said.
As part of the new four-song E.P., “Moon Rising,” that is expected to be released in February of next year, Lynn has worked on implementing new sounds into her acoustic feel. ”It’s called foc-electronic, or foctronic,” she said. “I have never really had the skills to do it yet, but have taken a few online courses, and some of the producers that I’m working with are really good at that stuff.”
New York has provided Lynn with opportunities hardly found anywhere else, including her performance at the Bitter End, a historical little stage where musicians like Bob Dylan have played. But her career didn’t start in known venues.
Blowing on a trumpet, and jamming on a guitar since the age of 10, she started early to write her own lyrics. Once, at age 12, Lynn was of fered to play one of her own songs as part of the school choir; she then felt the fulfillment that made her wanting to push it further.
At age 16, Lynn submitted all of her songs online to an independent Australian radio station, and—surprisingly to herself—got to the top of the chart. ”My songs were terrible, really bad,” she said, with a laughing emphasis. “But some of the talent reps and bloggers, would talk to me and give me advice on my songs. I’ve kept talking to them over the years.”
The inspiration for her songwriting comes in different waves; some stream from her experiences, others from personal interests and more complex thoughts.
“I’ve written a couple of love ones, but love songs are just sappy and boring,” Lynn said. “But when there’s songs that have a deeper level to them, I like that.”
The concert to support her funding of the E.P. will be held at the End Zone on Tuesday, Dec. 8, at 7 p.m. Entrance fee is $5. Lynn understands that college students and money is not the perfect match, but admits that no direct response is as valuable as the exposure and opportunity to play in front of her friends. “It’s good to have this performance opportunity where people come and see what I’m actually doing,” she said. “Maybe next time they hear a song, they’ll start talking about it to their friends, and so on.”

On Saturday, Nov. 20, the men’s soccer team took a trip into the city armed with 20 winter jackets, 20 hats, 20 scarves and 20 pairs of gloves to hand out to the homeless in an initiative that Alexander Billington, a senior international major and the organizer of the event, named #WarmerWinter.
Collegiate sports teams are required by the NCAA to complete 20 hours of community service each semester, but this particular initiative was organized as a separate endeavor. “I just felt like I had a great group of friends who were all capable of giving back so I wanted to organize something effective, that also had a little bit of longevity,” said Billington.
In the past, the men’s soccer team has completed community service events such as, working with a special needs soccer team, spending a day playing sports at a live-in facility for troubled children, volunteering at a charity triathlon and going for a dip at the annual Jones Beach Polar Bear Plunge. “I was skeptical about proposing the idea to the team since we have already completed our community service for the semester, but knowing the personalities on the team, I decided to go with it and the feedback was really positive,” said Billington.
The men’s soccer team decided to buy 20 new winter jackets from a local thrift store. “I managed to collect $440 in a day just by asking my teammates for $10 or $20 buck. Then we went to the thrift store, only to find out there was 50% off everything. [The discount] enabled us to have money left-over to buy all the hats, scarves and gloves too, so we got really lucky,” said Billington.
“It was great to see the reactions when we were giving out the jackets, many of the people said anything to keep them warm was a big help,” said Per Forgaard, a M.B.A. student said.
There are many initiatives currently helping many homeless people in need – soup kitchens or emergency food programs are examples of initiatives aid the homeless in their daily struggle to survive. In an article by NYDailyNews.com entitled “Hunger crisis: Charities are strained as nearly 1 in 5 New Yorkers depend on aid for food,” it is stated that there are currently “1.4 million people, who now rely on a patchwork network of 1,000 emergency food programs across the city to eat.”
“In Iceland, we really don’t have many homeless people,” said senior international business administration major Johan Kristjansson said. “You almost never see them, so sometimes it is frustrating to see so many people in need of help. I’m glad I could be part of something that could help give back.”
Despite the large patchwork of initiatives already in place for the homeless, Billington said that he still felt that #WarmerWinter was an important initiative, which would lessen the struggle of the homeless to stay warm especially during the frigid winter months.
“My teammates and I often talk about how freaking cold a New York winter is, but we barely have to spend time outside, maybe a couple of hours for practice each day,” Billington said. “But when
I walk past homeless people in the city, I just think about how cold they must be, how long they have been outside, and how long it will be before they get some warmth.”
“I think sometimes people don’t donate to certain charities because they can’t find the money and they feel like their donation is meaningless. The good thing about small, community-based initiatives is that people feel involved, and they know and feel like they are helping, not to mention the positive effects it can have on our dwindling notions of empathy and sympathy,” said Billington.

LIU Post is a culturally diverse campus featuring students from around the globe. According to collegedata.com, roughly 6 percent of the population is international students from an estimated 40 countries on our campus. How did they find our campus from abroad and why did they ultimately decide to attend at Post?
For me, I am an international student from Stockholm, Sweden. When I started researching schools online in New York with an English degree program, I found LIU Post and LIU Brooklyn. However, I felt
as if there wasn’t enough information about them for me to form an opinion by simply looking at a computer screen. So, I booked a ticket to New York with the sole purpose of going to see both Post and Brooklyn campuses.
Before I left Sweden, I had arranged meetings with the Admissions office and the International Students office at Post. When I arrived during the fall of 2012, the humongous and lavish-looking campus amazed me. Compared to the University of Stockholm, where I had last attended, and that had modern square-shaped buildings, the Post campus looked like an old, English dream that assured me I was as close to attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as I’d ever be. After my meetings, I took a liking to Post and never went to see the Brooklyn campus. I enrolled at Post for spring 2013 and well, the rest is history.
Everyone’s path to Post is different, even for students coming from the same country. However, international students provide interesting stories about how they made it to Post.
“I started off at Stony Brook doing the ESL [English as a second language program] and as I was completing the program a friend there recommended me to go to LIU Post, because it had a smaller campus and better professors,” said Mohammed Ahayd, a sophomore radiology major from Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
Ahayd said that he is “more than happy with his decision to come to Post. I really like the campus and the people here are really friendly.” Muhannad Falemban, a freshman international studies major from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said that he found the school for the reason that his sister started her studies at Post in fall 2014.
“I started my studies in spring 2015, and I applied for other schools as well, but when I got accepted at Post, I decided to go here since my sister was already enrolled at Post,” he said. Falemban mentioned that the hardest thing about being away from home and deciding to study abroad has been the language barrier. “I’ve only been in the U. S for less than a year,” he said, “so it’s a learning process.”
“I finished my undergraduate degree in Pakistan, and I applied to three different schools in New York for graduate school,” said Priya Devi, a masters of business administration graduate student from Karachi, Pakistan. “But a friend suggested Post and when I got accepted here I enrolled in spring 2015.”
Devi said that her brother had already moved from Pakistan to Long Island, so she had him as support system when she moved to the U.S. Still the move hasn’t been a walk in the park. “I find it difficult to make friends here because of the workload from my graduate program,” Devi said. “So I don’t have that much free time to make friends.”
“I found Post as I researched schools and I applied online,” said Chenghan Kuo, a junior economics major from Tainan, Taiwan. “When I got accepted, I decided to move to Long Island as I already had my uncle who lives here as a support to help me learn the language.”
Kuo added, “Learning English is hard, it’s frustrating when I’m in class and I don’t understand the meaning, but you can’t stop and ask the professor to repeat themselves.” Kau said he’s happy with his choice to study at Post and says he likes the school despite the challenges he has to overcome with the language barrier.
These international students relied on other people’s experiences, and their decision to enroll at Post was because of recommendations. For those international students, taking the leap of faith and leaving home was made easier as many of them had the comfort of knowing someone already studying at Post or living on Long Island.

What makes a great movie? Seriously. As we enter what you’d call ‘awards season’ I can’t help but wonder what qualifies a great movie, why these particular titles are picked by critics and the Academy to be shoved at as the golden children of the year.
This time around we have selections like “The Revenant,” “Carol,” “The Danish Girl” and “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” already being talked up and setting down the road to awards. This makes me wonder what makes an awards-worthy film tick? Is it all hype? Is there a bias in play here, or do films truly stand on their own merit? What are the elements that qualify a particular movie for these sorts of accolade, at least according to the Hollywood illuminati?
Let’s look back at Oscar nominees from the past to gauge the palate of the Academy. One key factor that appears to come into play is if a film is inspirational, particularly a film based on a true story. At the 2014 Academy Awards we saw films such as “Selma,” “Theory of Everything,” “The Imitation” and “American Sniper” receive several nominations — all of these are based on true, inspirational stories of perseverance. This seems to be an ingredient favored by American filmgoers, or at least those who tell filmgoers what they should be watching.
You don’t have to roll back the years very far to see that this is a consistent interest. The 2014 Best Picture Winner at the Oscars was “12 Years a Slave”, the true story of ex-slave Solomon Northup, yet another tale of a character overcoming impossible odds, perhaps a notion stressed within the American film world as it aligns with the ideology of the American Dream and exceptionalism.
The film world appears to be self-interested. Plots of Best Picture films like “Birdman”, “Argo” and “The Artist” are directly imbedded in the world of filmmakers and actors. While this could be slated as a masturbatory facet of the industry, one might also consider the ways in which meta-culture has infiltrated the film world as of late. While it was snubbed as far as the Oscars go, “The Lego Movie” made major bank and received wide acclaim, no doubt due to its fresh, irreverent and self-aware humor that directly acknowledges its own artificiality.
Looking forward, then, why would a film like “The Revenant” (coming out Christmas day) already be slated for an Oscar nod? Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, who has been gipped of a Best Actor nod for time immemorial, not to mention Tom Hardy. Director: Alejandro Inarritu, whose “Birdman” just won Best Picture at the 2014 Oscars. Story: based on a true story and novel by Michael Punke, in which fur trapper who was left for dead and robbed after a grizzly attack in the 1800s seeks revenge. These elements already set the film apart from huge amount of titles released in the American market each year, building up our expectations.
The somewhat sad truth here is that, even if “The Revenant” ends up being fantastic, even if any other hyped films does the same, it appears as if the best of the year are already selected for the average movie goer by pre-existing qualifications. And in this way, despite the hundreds of films that could be seen and enjoyed, theater are packed for only a handful of these titles we’re coaxed into liking. What I’m saying here is that we must judge what makes a great movie for ourselves, and only consider with a grain of salt what the burgeoning zeitgeist of history and popular culture tells us is great.

On Friday, Nov. 20, singer-songwriter Adele made her comeback, after not releasing new music for about three years, with her new album “25.” A few months ago, she released the hit single “Hello,” sparking excitement among both fans and non-fans alike. “To be honest I was never a huge fan of Adele,” said Marisa Kofmehl, a senior public relations major. “It’s not that I thought her music was bad I just was never interested in it, but with ‘Hello’ I found myself constantly playing it on repeat.”
“Hello” is a song filled with deep emotion that talks about trying to ask your former lover for forgiveness but they never seem to respond, as she sings, “When I call you never seem to be home”. The song has been extremely successful and it created more anticipation and more excitement for the new album.
Unfortunately, when the album was released various fans, myself included, found the album to be surprisingly ordinary. “I was extremely excited when I found out Adele was [releasing] a new album,” said Jawaan Smith, a senior arts management major. “I’ve been a fan for a while and I love her to pieces, but I have to say this album definitely wasn’t what I was expecting.”
Now, the album isn’t a bad album, Smith assures us that Adele’s voice shines right through in every song. “The music isn’t bad, the album is a good album, it’s just very ordinary and I think a lot of people just had really high expectations after listening to Hello,” said Smith. “It’s not much different from ‘21’ (her last album) but I think ‘21’ is even better than this one.”
Ileana Lado, a senior psychology major, who is also a big fan of Adele’s music, agrees that the album wasn’t quite what she was expecting. “The album is more pop than I expected based off the two singles released before the album dropped,” Lado said.
Lado does admit that she has been listening to the album on repeat many times since it was released. “I have to say that the song that resonated with me the most is ‘All I Ask’,” she said. “It’s probably one of my favorite ballads she’s ever written.”
Another issue that Smith found with the album was the cost of it on iTunes. “To buy the entire album it cost you about $11 which I was fine with until I realized that there are only 11 songs on the album,” said Smith. “I don’t know I just think that’s a bit ridiculous when there are other artists selling albums with up to 17 tracks for a similar price.”
Smith admits that he will probably still buy the album since it’s not on the music streaming service, Spotify. “I am still a huge fan of her voice and I do love her so I will probably purchase the album eventually, but I do think it’s a bit overpriced for just 11 tracks.”
The album “25” definitely has inspiring songs and considering Adele’s voice, sometimes that’s just enough to make a good album. When it comes down to it, even though the album is very ordinary, with not much variety, Adele’s voice makes it a powerful record.

As the holiday season approaches, the weather is changing and the temperature is dropping, which means finals are approaching. At this time of the fall semester, students often become run down and sick. This could result from not getting enough rest due to long nights studying, or simply from not dressing appropriately for the weather when now that temperatures have dropped. Regardless of the reasoning for a possible cold coming on, there are ways to keep healthy during this time of change and stress.
According to the Nicole Regan, Melissa Goldstein and Jonnie Agresta, the campus nutritionists, there are some general steps to a healthy lifestyle. Though seemingly simple, these tips are important and could help avoid the possibility of sickness. These three campus nutritionists are available free of charge for all students. Students can make appointments for a consultation about their eating habits, exercise habits or a combination of both.
The campus nutritionists encourage us to listen to our bodies. This may seem silly or overly simple, but as your body adjusts to stress, it can tell you when enough is enough. For example, knowing when to go to sleep instead of studying all night and picking back up in the morning.
In regards to listening to your body, eating healthy foods is important. “Eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables and keep healthy snacks on you. Also get your nutrients from real foods, don’t rely on vitamins and supplements,” the campus nutritionists said.
Sophomore dance major, Emily Bivona, is constantly on the go with her busy schedule, but she makes sure that she is stays healthy through it all. “I make sure that my snacks throughout the day aren’t too salty or sweet, because junk food won’t get me through my day,” Bivona said. “I also try to drink at least three bottles of water a day to [stay] hydrated.”
In addition to healthy eating, sleep is important, especially for college students with rigorous schedules and work loads. According to the National Sleep Foundation’s website, young adults from the ages 18 to 25 need 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Though this may seem difficult while attempting to finish homework, it is crucial for students to be able to sleep for a substantial amount of hours to ensure his or her body to runs well.
The National Sleep Foundation recommends sticking to a sleep schedule; go to sleep at the same time every night for the same amount of hours.
Websites such as health.com, and wholeliving.com offer tips on an array of health-related topics such as eating habits and overall wellness. The campus nutritionists are also a helpful resource for students, available for appointments or consultation by email at post-nutritionist@liu.edu. They can also be found in Pell Hall/Life Science, room 150.

If you’re not moving forward, then you’re moving backward. Chances are, there is someone else out there developing the next “super product” that will revolutionize the movie industry. Just ask Hollywood; actually, just ask Warner Brothers Production Studios they’re the ones who brought sound to movies, and forever changed the world of cinema as we know it.
Before I begin, let me take you back to the ‘Roaring Twenties.’ The first World War had just ended, our boys were back home, and our women were out of the factories, no longer manufacturing ammunition, or any other kind of weapon for that matter. It was time to relax, or, as President Warren G. Harding would say, it was a “return to normalcy.”
During the 1920s, Americans would attend the theatre to see a movie “nearly three times a week,” according to Emily Thompson, a history professor at Princeton University. Compared to the types of movies that premiere today, there was one significant difference in the movies that premiered in 1927; they were silent. Charlie Chaplin was the premier actor in the late ‘20s and early ‘30s, and he did not speak in most of his movies. In fact, a majority of his movies lasted no more than ten minutes.
For silent films, the only sounds heard while these movies ran, was the sound of the band that played in a pit in front of the screen. Oh, and the crowd. A crowd so naïve and new to movies, that “[it] would get up and run for cover when a train was coming their direction on the screen because they thought it was real!” said Dan Cox, a respected professor of the Media Arts department who has worked at WCWP radio for nearly thirty years.
The transition from silent film, to a movie with sound was seamless; a perfect fit, and one that revolutionized the movie industry. May I begin with Disney’s “Frozen”? Granted, “Frozen” is an animation-based film, however, would animation be as popular as it is today if there was no sound to this films?
Just to put things further into perspective, sound has opened the door for a totally different type of actor; one that does not require a physical onscreen appearance, just his or her voice. You no longer need to ‘look’ the part to be in a movie. Technically, you don’t need to act the part either (although some would disagree). All one needs in essence, is a very, very good voice over, and that’s it.
Just imagine Seth McFarlan’s “Ted 2” without sound; it’s unfathomable. The truth of the matter is, Hollywood calls upon a much more talented actor than they did nearly a century ago. Acting ‘in character’
in front of a camera has taken on a whole new meaning, partly because now, the storyline is in the words, not just the action.
Even soundtracks and special effects play a bigger role now than they ever have before. Perhaps 50 years ago sound still played a complementary role to a film. However, now you can win an award off it. The money doesn’t stop there in both a literal and figurative tense.
First off, the movie “Pitch Perfect” doesn’t exist without sound in cinema, and it’s because of sound in movies that ticket prices have skyrocketed since 1927. The price to view a silent movie was barely a nickel back then, and according to a National Research Poll, it costs about $10 to watch a movie. That’s an increase by two hundred fold!
So next time you see a movie and enjoy it, thank the Warner Brothers, not just for making the movie, but for investing sound in movies, when everyone else said sound “was not needed.” They thought otherwise and took the initiative.
On behalf of the Pioneer, and LIU Post, thank you Harry, Al, Sam, and Jack Warner. I think I’ll see a movie tonight.

All 13 episodes of the Marvel television show “Jessica Jones,” were released on Netflix on Nov. 20. This is only the second Marvel television show to premiere on the streaming service, following “Daredevil” last April. “Jessica Jones” will be followed by “Luke Cage,” premiering in early 2016 and “Iron Fist,” which premieres late 2016.
A mini-series called “The Defenders” will follow the four shows. In “The Defenders”, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist will form a team and fight together to defend Hell’s Kitchen. “Jessica Jones” is the second female led TV show in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Marvel Cinematic Universe includes every Marvel movie from 2008s “Iron Man” to 2015s “Ant-Man” and every TV show from 2013s “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” to “Jessica Jones.”
In the show, which is based on the Alias comic book series, Jessica Jones is a former superhero who hung up her cape after a personal tragedy and opened up her own private investigation business in Hell’s Kitchen. In the first episode, “AKA Ladies Night”, Jessica takes on a case involving a missing NYU student, Hope, when her parents come looking for her.
After following up on several leads, Jessica discovers that Hope has been captured by Zebediah Kilgrave aka “The Purple Man” through his power of mind control. Kilgrave is Jessica’s greatest villain who she thought was dead after he was hit by a bus.
Throughout the episode, Jessica also crosses paths with her best friend Trish Walker, a talk show host and Jeri Hogarth, a lawyer with whom Jessica occasionally works. “AKA Ladies Night” also introduces Luke Cage as a bar owner in Hell’s Kitchen. The final quarter of the episode is very intense, ending with a massive cliffhanger, which will leave viewers wanting more.
Krysten Ritter stars as Jessica Jones, whose powers include flight and super strength. She plays the role extremely well and is able to convey all of Jessica’s emotions with ease. She particularly excels at dealing with Jessica’s PTSD issues as a result of her encounters with the Purple Man. The supporting cast is also very strong with David Tennant and Mike Colter as the standouts. David Tennant, who plays Kilgrave,
is probably most known for his role as the Tenth Doctor in “Doctor Who”, but these two roles could not be more different.
Though not seen in the first episode, Tennant’s presence is always felt in Jessica’s mind and comes across as very creepy and menacing whenever Jessica thinks about her time under his control. Mike Colter is also great as Luke Cage, whose superpowers include unbreakable skin and super strength. He not only looks the part, but also has great chemistry with Ritter which is important since Luke and Jessica have a relationship in the comics.
While “Daredevil” predicated itself on great fight scenes and plenty of action, “Jessica Jones” is more of a psychological horror series with the addition of Kilgrave. With his power of mind control, Kilgrave can make anyone do what he wants and uses his powers for purely evil intentions.
Viewers who enjoy any of the Marvel movies, other comic book movies, or the Alias comic book series should tune in. Non-superhero fans may also enjoy “Jessica Jones” since Jessica’s superpowers do not play a big role in the pilot and she mostly relies on her detective skills to solve the case.

After splitting their first two home games of the season, the men’s basketball team’s offense erupted as they took care of business in a 95-81 victory against Bloomfield College last Tuesday, Nov. 24, in Bloomfield, N.J. The Pioneers (4-1) turned on the jets from the get-go as they jumped out to a 36-22 lead in the first half. Junior forward Greg Dotson scored seven points in the early stages of the contest, but picked up two quick fouls earning him a seat on the bench for the remainder of the half.
Although Dotson was sidelined, the Pioneers were able to hold on to a 49-40 advantage heading into the locker room. Senior guard Dillon Burns tallied seven points, four rebounds, three assists, and two steals in the period, and sophomore forward Hunter Powell provided a spark off the bench in relief of Dotson, collecting 10 points and four boards.
Defensively, the Pioneers played lockdown defense as they limited the Bears (0-4) to just 35 percent shooting from the field and 22 percent behind the three-point arc.
In the latter stanza, the Pioneers allowed the Bears to come within two possessions until the Pioneers took flight going on a 16-6 run. Burns and Dotson drained back-to-back threes during that stretch. The burst was capped off by a fast break layup from senior guard Akosa Maduegbunam giving the visitors a 70-54 cushion. It was all LIU from there on out as they continued to bury shots from the floor shooting 50 percent on the day and 39 percent from downtown.
One key piece of the Pioneers second half success was Dotson who made up for his early foul troubles in the first half, scoring 15 points. Burns continued his aggressive play with seven points, dishing out four assists, and swiping two steals.
Five players scored in double figures for the Pioneers as Doston led the pack with 22 points. Senior forward Michael Phillip pitched in with 15 points and nine rebounds off the bench. Junior guard Jared Hall scored 14 points and Burns finished right behind him with 13 points, in addition to his seven assists, five rebounds, and four steals. Powell did all of his damage in the first half with 10 points and boards.
Head Coach Erik Smiles and the Pioneers are set to return to the floor on Saturday, Dec. 5, against Mercy College in an East Coast Conference showdown. Tip-off is scheduled for 2 p.m. from the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y.

For the second-straight season, the men’s soccer team won the 2015 NCAA Division II Championship East Region title after knocking off the no. 3 ranked Penmen from Southern New Hampshire University, 5-4, in penalty kicks on Thursday, Nov.
19. Both sides played a very physical first half, with the Penmen outshooting the Pioneers, 6-4. SNHU’s keeper was put to work in the first 45 minutes, stopping three shots. At halftime, the score was deadlocked at zero. In the latter stanza, the level of play stayed the same and both teams were kept off the board for the remainder of regulation. In the first overtime, the Penmen had two golden opportunities to score and move on to the next round, but junior keeper Jesper Malmstrom stood strong and sent back a pair of shots to keep the game scoreless.
In the next overtime, the Pioneers big chance to win the game before penalty kicks came when freshman forward Charlie Ledula made a dash for the post and headed the ball towards the net, but the keeper made an incredible save to keep the match scoreless.
In the penalty kick session, both sides converted their first four attempts, keeping with the theme of the day, which was neither side giving an edge. After graduate back Seb Baxter netted a goal to put the Pioneers up 5-4, Jonathon Lupinelli, who could have sent the match into a sixth round, shot over the bar, and sent the Pioneers to the quarterfinals. The loss for the Penmen was only their second in 22 games this season.
The Pioneers returned to the pitch on Saturday, Nov. 21, to do battle with another no.3 seed in the University of Charleston. In their quarterfinal matchup, the Pioneers fell by a score of 2-1.
The Pioneers found themselves behind the eight ball early on; letting up two goals in the game’s opening 23 minutes. Seeking some sort of momentum heading into the break, LIU turned to graduate midfielder Tom Bowen who sent a free kick into the mesh cutting the lead in half. At the break, the Pioneers trailed 2-1.
The second half was dictated by the spectacular play of Charleston keeper Fabian Velt. He made three saves; including one that could’ve sent the match into overtime. With under a minute left in the match, Ledula got a shot away and Velt used every inch he had at his disposal to get a fingertip on the ball and keep it out of the net. That scoring chance was the last one the Pioneers got and Charleston came away with the thrilling 2-1 victory.
The Pioneers concluded their 2015 season with an overall record of 15-3-3. Under head coach Andreas Lindberg, this is the team’s fifth straight 15-win campaign. The Pioneers will kick off pre-season again in the summer of 2016.

A Note From the Opinions Editor
Dear Readers,
An issue arose after the publication of the November 18 issue of ‘The Pioneer.’ In the Opinions section, one of the Pioneer’s regular staff writers, a sophomore international student, wrote an opinion piece about the controversy that has arisen in connection with Starbucks’ new red cups. His opinion was that there are more important topics to discuss than the Starbucks holiday cups. He mentioned a subject of international concern that he felt strongly about; his, and only his opinion. The article was found online by a blogger not affiliated with our school, who also felt very strongly about the topic, and who disagreed with our columnist’s opinion, which, of course, is certainly his right. The blogger criticized our writer’s article online in harsh language, and, ultimately, his criticism made its way back to administrators at LIU.
The Pioneer’s opinion columnist, like any other student who is encouraged to write for the Pioneer, freely expressed his opinion and only his opinion. All articles in the Opinions section of ‘The Pioneer’ only reflect the opinions of the author/writer of the article, and not the collective opinions of ‘The Pioneer’ or LIU Post as an institution. I write to make this evident and clear to our readers. It is my responsibility as the Opinions editor to make sure that these things don’t go unnoticed if it’s within my grasp. However, as a fellow student and representative of the university, I also think that it’s important to allow students to voice their opinions. I understand that not all readers will agree with those opinions, but the Pioneer provides a forum for those readers to write letters to the editor with their disagreement too. Sometimes Opinions pieces may make readers feel uncomfortable. They may even possibly offend them. But, ‘The Pioneer’ and our staff does not publish articles with that aim. We try our best to provide a way for students to discuss timely topics of importance to the student body. This is what all good students newspapers should strive to do. I want to reiterate that every opinion piece that ‘The Pioneer’ publishes, only represents the opinion/thoughts of the person who writes the article, and not the rest of our staff and/or LIU Post. On behalf of ‘The Pioneer’ staff, thank you for reading this, and for your time.
Julian Wilson

The most serious accidents sometimes require medical attention via ambulance, to transport the injured to the hospital quickly. Until the start of this semester, an ambulance provided the LIU campus with an extra layer of safety– just in case. However, this fall semester did not have an ambulance stationed on campus.
With an ambulance no longer present on campus, some students admittedly feel less safe, and are wondering why the change was made.
Din Djukanovic, a junior accounting major, sees a major problem with the ambulance service being shut down, citing time as a main concern. “I don’t think [the ambulance service] should have been shut down,” he said. “Rather than the EMT being on the scene in less than five minutes we [now] have to wait at least 20 [minutes] for an outside EMT to come into campus,” he continued.
Djukanovic also said that his friend Nick Manikis, a junior health and science major, was an EMT on campus last semester, before the ambulance services were shut down. Manikis is upset about the lack of emergency services on campus.
“I am aware that there [are] no more emergency medical services on campus and am very angered by that,” Manikis said. “We had an ambulance on campus 24/7 responding to medical emergencies within seconds, that made me feel safer,” he said.
Now, one of Manikis’ biggest concerns, is the time factor, reflecting back on a moment when the Post ambulance saved his friends life. “When one of my friends had an allergic reaction and had difficulty breathing last semester, the C.W. Post ambulance was there within seconds,” Manikis said. “If a serious medical emergency happens now, I’m afraid there won’t be an ambulance on campus in time,” he said. According to Manikis, there are almost 400 emergency calls made to public safety every two semesters. “We definitely need an ambulance on campus,” he said.
Student concern over their safety has raised questions as to why these services are no longer available on campus. Dean of Students, Abigail van Vlerah would not specifically state why the ambulance is no longer on campus. Van Vlerah said, “LIU Post is committed to a safe campus with a high quality response system for ambulatory services.” In addition, Van Vlerah said that public safety officers are trained in first aid and CPR, and maintain “continuous communication with local authorities.” Van Vlerah would not say whether there are plans to bring the ambulance back to campus.
Georgia Gantidis, a sophomore criminal justice major, is unsure on her stance on having an ambulance on campus. While Gantidis has not used the ambulance on campus personally in the past, one of her friends, who has a kidney problem, was taken by the on-campus ambulance to a hospital for more treatment, in the spring 2015 semester. Gantidis said that having an ambulance on campus is “helpful” but can understand the decision made by administration to eliminate the program. “[The ambulance] is helpful, but it’s costly and there are other ways people can get help. It can go both ways,” she said.
Only time will tell if the ambulance will make a return onto campus next semester. Spring semester is approaching, and although “spring” is in its name, Long Island has been hit with harsh winters during this time, making travel a dangerous task for just about anyone.
Should an emergency happen, the LIU community will need to put trust in public safety and its protocols to keep everyone safe. As of now, there are no plans to bring back the ambulance.

The Post Foundations course has been revamped to incorporate a service learning component into the class. In return, students in the course will be involved in a community service project over the duration of the class. The concept was inspired by the perceived notion of students, that college is only good for textbook knowledge, according to John Lutz, Chair of the English Department.
“Many students arrive at college with the idea that they’re here only to learn skills directly related to their careers; however… With the help of dedicated student leaders, first-year students are being taught the value of empathy and learning,” said Lutz. Lutz, in addition to faculty and staff, decided that this was the best way to get students involved right when they come to Post.
This program has been a work in progress for the past year, but with the recent involvement of peer mentors, it has become a more organized part of the class. Previously, the professor for Post Foundations would run the service learning project; now that responsibility has been given to the peer mentor in the class. A peer mentor, “has the role of helping new students adjust to college life by giving advice and guidance,” according to Lutz. There is one peer mentor in every class.
Service learning became more organized as peer mentors dedicated more time to the class. According to peer mentor Stephanie Frobin, “The difference this year is that peer mentors are taking a Friday class dedicated to helping further our ideas and learning things from one another to inspire us.”
This is Frobin’s third year as a mentor, and last year for her first project her class planted trees, “to help them understand how important it is to take care of our environment and to be proactive about keeping earth clean.” This year she plans on starting a recycling program, with a goal to raise awareness about how the environment is impacted by trash.
Some of the other projects include cleaning up local beaches, organizing food and clothing drives, and another class sold pumpkins and donated the proceeds to charity. There are a total of 32 sections of Post Foundations, and every class has their own project.
It was reported earlier in the semester by The Pioneer, that Post Foundations was originally called College 101, but was changed in 2014. In addition to the different title, the class became a one credit course, instead of being a pass or fail course. The course also includes: learning how to improve study habits, note taking, time management, and the common read.

On the first floor of Hillwood Commons, the Gold Coast Cinema became cluttered as the anticipated arrival of LIU President Kimberly Cline grew near. Students and faculty alike filled the rows at 12:30 p.m. on Nov. 3, to hear the president speak on “contemporary issues, and to show strength in what defines LIU Post as a great modern learning institution,” according to the email sent two weeks ago by President Cline.
Father Daniel O’Brien, LIU’s new Chaplain and Campus Minister, who replaced Father Ted this fall, opened what he referred to as the “convocation” with a prayer invocation about the attacks on Paris on Nov. 13. Father O’Brien said that with chaos eventually comes tranquility and peace. He said that it is up to LIU Post to do their part in the search of that peace.
Next, President Cline came onto the stage. She spoke for about three minutes about the introduction of “LIU Cares.” This movement, still in its infancy, was introduced in light of what happened in Paris and Lebanon with the hopes that Post will come together in the challenging times that the world is facing and will face.
Following the president were four representatives from the Student Government Association. The SGA members encouraged the LIU community to be involved in services around the campus and local community. They mentioned upcoming events they are hosting, such as blood drives and the free Thanksgiving dinner, to gain support from the LIU students.
The final speaker, Professor Eric Lichten, the Chair of the Sociology Department, spoke the most about foreign and domestic world issues. He said that we must stand together as a family and that each individual is connected to the greater good. Around the world, near or far, suffering knows no boundaries, said Lichten. He said that those who suffer are an extension of us and we are part of the solution to grow humanity. Professor Lichten closed his speech saying “education kills ignorance.”
The event was followed by an ice cream bar, hosted by the SGA and a community dialogue in the lecture hall of Hillwood Commons. Because there were no questions permitted during the speeches, the audience could ask any questions of the speakers or add any comments they had in a general forum setting. It was not mentioned during the discussion whether or not there would be other forums in the near future.

On Nov. 9, the Writing Center in Humanities Hall, room 202 added a new feature – a lending library. The lending library is a bookshelf filled with different genres varying from mysteries, romance, poetry, memoir, non-fiction, and fiction, to name a few. It is set up to allow students to borrow books of their liking for free, to read in their leisure time. The initiative to create a lending library was made by Mary Pigliacelli, the Director of the Writing Center.
Pigliacelli explained, “Because there is a strong connection between liking to read and being a strong writer, we wanted to provide students with easy access to books that they feel excited to get back to reading. Our selection of books aren’t books that are assigned in classes…our collection are pleasure readings to read over a break or such.”
The Writing Center’s rules for borrowing a book are simple. Students pick a book to take home without having to register what they borrowed, and then they return it when they are finished reading. There is no limit to how many books, or a time limit for how long a student can borrow a book.
Kristen Roedel, an English graduate student, has already used the lending library in its first weeks of operation. She said, “I’m currently reading “Dad Is Fat” by Jim Gaffigan. I am more likely to pick that up and read it, than to sit around and procrastinate on my homework. I think that in reading something that is enjoyable, you are allowing yourself to regenerate those brain cells and be refreshed. It’s a nice escape from reality. If you are reading something enjoyable, you are more likely to go and be on task later.”
Kaycee Grancher, an English graduate student, agreed. “Reading pleasure books such as the ones in the writing center takes off the stress of reading. For me to actively engage in a relatable story is relaxing.”
So far only a few students have borrowed books from the new feature. Pigliacelli is positive that once students are informed about the lending library they will borrow books, as they plan to put up posters around campus. Compared to the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, the writing center has no time limit on their books, to further accommodate students to not feel any stress regarding finishing up a book before a due date.
Pigliacelli explained that all of the current books have been donations, “We accept donations….If anyone has read a book they like and is done with it, and wants to pass it along, we can put it to good use at our lending library. However, our biggest donor is Madeline Vazques, who works at the Learning Support Center. She has donated countless books. Also, Brian Skulnik, one of our staff members who works for a publisher, has brought in books that are newly published books.”

On Tuesday, Nov. 24, the women’s basketball team was searching for its first victory of the season against Bloomfield College. The game, which came down to the last shot, didn’t bounce in LIU’s favor and the team fell by a score of 54-52.
The Pioneers played a very good first half, taking a three-point lead into the break. In that first half, the Pioneers shot 40 percent from the field and 33 from behind the arc. After a big run by Bloomfield that put them up 11 going into the fourth quarter, the Pioneers woke up offensively.
Senior guard Jalyn Brown drained a three pointer, which was followed by a lay-up from fellow senior guard Khea Gibbs. That brought the score to 53-52 in favor of Bloomfield with just under a minute left. After a trip by Bloomfield to the free throw line, the Pioneers, down by two, missed a chance to tie it as Gibbs shot was off the mark.
Freshman guard Robyn Francis led in the scoring department with nine points and also added six boards. Brown also had nine points off the bench while Gibbs tallied eight points of her own.
The Pioneers looked for their first win on Sunday, Nov. 29, when they traveled to Massachusetts to face Stonehill College. Again, the Pioneers were denied their first victory of the season in a 62-41 loss.
Stonehill had the upper hand from the opening tip, as they dominated early and often. They jumped out to a quick 20-10 lead after the first quarter, then played lockdown defense and allowed just five Pioneer points in the second quarter. They took a 41-15 lead into the break.
The Pioneers attempted to make a comeback in the second half, but they were facing the clock, as well as Stonehill. Eventually, time ran out and the Pioneers lost by well more than double-digits.
For the Pioneers, senior center Nyasia Davis scored 10 to lead the team while freshman guard Shannon Doyle scored nine and grabbed six boards to go along with two steals and two blocks. For Stonehill, they were led by sophomore guard Courtney Walsh who had a game-high 17 points and also dished out three assists.
The Pioneers are back in action on Wednesday, Dec. 2, against Mercy College from the Pratt Recreation Center. Tip-off is set for 5 p.m.

On Tuesday, Nov. 10, the tables and umbrellas outside of Humanities Hall were knocked over due to inclement weather. After seeing the aftermath of the storm, several students came together, independently, and took matters into their own hands, turning back over the tables and umbrellas without being asked.
While the students thought no one was watching, there were actually two witnesses; Dr. Barbara Fowles, the Chair of the Media Arts Department, and Arlene Weydig, the media arts department secretary. The two watched the event unfold through their office window in the front of Humanities Hall.
Dr. Fowles stated that she first witnessed one student’s attempt to straighten the tables. Four or five more students then came over, putting down their backpacks and helped with the cleanup. After the tables were fixed, each student went their own way.
Dr. Fowles expressed her appreciation for this unrequested act of kindness on the part of the students, “They just saw another guy doing it and stopped to help. It was a very nice gesture.” She added, “I think it was a thoughtful thing for them to do, especially in the pouring rain.” The umbrellas attached to the tables have now been taken away, perhaps as a result of this situation. William Kirker, Head of Facilities, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about why the umbrellas were put away.
Usually when an act of kindness like this occurs, the students in question are recognized in some way. However, since Fowles and Weydig did not know the students, it makes it harder to personally acknowledge their good deed. Dr. Fowles does believe that the students do need to be recognized in some small way.
“I think a story in The Pioneer will be recognition enough…I think just the fact that they were noticed might make other students think about being thoughtful,” Dr. Fowles stated.
While this act was witnessed, some others around campus may not be. Dr. Fowles believes that events like this happen around campus, particularly when someone is in need.
“I do think things like this happen on campus, though maybe not often,” Dr. Fowles said. “I have seen it happen mostly when someone gets hurt or falls ill. People seem to gather around and help in those situations.” She suggested that The Pioneer could incorporate a good Samaritan section, which may encourage students to come forward with other acts of kindness they have seen.
If readers have more information about this event or knows the students, they should contact The Pioneer so these students can be named and properly recognized for their good deed.

To the Pioneer editors:
As the Chairperson of the Department of Communications and Film (Media Arts), I would like to express my support for the editors of the Pioneer as they deal with an unfortunate response to an opinion piece in the November 18 issue of the paper.
Our journalism program trains students to report the news fairly and responsibly, with all legitimate sides thoroughly and fairly given weight. However, the Pioneer also provides a forum for students to voice their views on current issues of importance to them. The “Opinions” section of the paper, in contrast to the “News” section, gives students the opportunity to express personal opinions in a campus forum. The opinions expressed may not be the opinions of the editors, other students, faculty members, or school administrators. Yet, it is important, at a university, for students to have the opportunity to freely express views that may be in the minority of public opinion, and may indeed be offensive to some.
Because they are students, sometimes these opinions may be presented using language others consider tactless. This is a frequent occurrence in the world of student op-ed writing. The student editors of the Pioneer have the task of critically and skeptically editing the opinion pieces before they are published, but they do not, and absolutely should not, impose their own views on their writers. When an op-ed writer offers a piece that appears to go against mainstream views, it is, in fact, particularly important for the student editors to bend over backwards in their efforts to afford the writer free expression. This is what the First Amendment is all about. Though we may not agree with the ideas put forth, we “adults” in the campus community should defend their right to discuss controversial issues in a responsible manner, and we should certainly not teach them that their focus should be on avoiding offending readers, even those in positions of authority.
Because they are still learning their craft, they may make decisions that seem, from the outside, to be unwise. But, it is important for us to understand that, like the science student who may create an explosion in the lab, we should not squelch them, but rather encourage them to develop and refine their sense of editorial judgment through practice. When journalism students go out in the world to practice journalism today, they must be independent and ethical thinkers. The Pioneer staff gains that invaluable experience every week as they work hard to put out the paper. When the campus newspaper is restricted and second-guessed by authority figures, this cannot happen. At a university, all students- all members of the campus community for that matter- must have the opportunity to freely express themselves. For students, faculty members and administrators who disagree with a given piece in the Pioneer, the appropriate reaction should be to write a rational and intelligent response to the “Letters to the Editor” department, which is provided by the paper for that purpose. It is the role of a quality student newspaper to create a conversation on campus about important issues of the day. Our campus newspaper creates such a forum for students and others. In the process, it may ruffle some feathers. We should commend the editors for not shrinking from what they may have seen as a controversial piece, rather than attack them for doing so.
The Pioneer should continue to aim for excellence for the benefit of our entire community, and we should support, rather than undermine, their efforts.
Sincerely,
Barbara Fowles, PhD
Chairperson
Department of Communications and Film ( Media Arts)
