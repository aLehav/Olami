LIU Post’s women’s field hockey team is collecting prom dresses on campus for Prom Boutique, an event hosted by the Long Island Volunteer Center. The drive benefits young women in the local community who were directly impacted by Hurricane Sandy and who cannot afford to purchase a dress for prom.
The dresses will be collected from now until Tuesday April 2, 2013 and then distributed to high school girls in the local community.
The field hockey team has always wanted to do a prom dress drive, but it never worked out with the teams schedule “timing wise,” explained assistant coach Ashleigh Daniels. “Our team is very involved in community service and this drive is very special to each of us,” said Daniels. This spring, the team finally decided it was the perfect time to participate in the dress drive.
“When we announced the community service project to the team [before spring break], we received nothing but positive feedback and excitement,” said Daniels.
The following week, the girls were off for spring break, digging through their closets and calling for help from all their family and friends back home.  “As women, we are all aware of the importance of prom. We want to share and help create that perfect prom experience for other young females. And let’s be honest, it all starts with the dress,” said Daniels.
Freshman Health Science major and field hockey teammate, Heidi Schaffner, explained that she wants to make sure every girl gets her prom experience. “Knowing that prom was one of my favorite memories of high school, I would not want a girl to have to miss the experience because they could not afford a dress to wear,” said Schaffner.
“I brought in a few dresses, as well as hung up a few posters to promote the event, but it is the team effort that will make the difference,” added Schaffner.
Cindy Russell, a freshman Health Science major and field hockey teammate, said, “We chose to do this because we are constantly looking for ways to help and give back to the community, and what better way than to allow a girl to go to her high school prom.”
According to Russell, the team has been posting statuses on Facebook and Twitter to reach out to their friends and family in hopes of increasing the amounts of donations they will receive. “Most of us have donated ourselves and will continue to donate,” said Russell.
“Prom was one of my most treasured and memorable moments in my life. Almost every girl cannot wait until the day that they can go to prom, so I could not imagine not being able to attend. I am especially glad we are able to allow these girls to go to prom,” explained Russell.
Russell explains that they do not get to meet the girls that they are helping, “however that would be a great experience,” she said.
Sarah Montgomery, a junior Education major and field hockey teammate, explained that once they heard about the organization Becca’s Closet, which collects and donates formal attire to young girls with financial need, she and her team deemed it a great cause to support. “I think that everyone should give try and give back and do a little something for someone else,” said Montgomery.
“It’s always a great feeling to help someone out who is less fortunate,” said Montgomery. She hopes to participate in the event every year.
Daniels began researching the cause and was astounded by the amount of organizations that do this every year. Prom dress donations are apparently very popular all over the U.S. “A local organization, we believed, would be best and, as a result, I came across Becca’s Closet,” said Daniels.
The team was informed of an opportunity to help those impacted by Hurricane Sandy. “Immediately, it hit home for all of us. Our whole area was affected somehow by Sandy and this was another opportunity for us to give back,” said Daniels.
The coaching staff thought it would be great to reach out to the whole LIU community for more support, which is why they have extended the due date for dress collection until Tuesday, April 2, 2013. 
The team found out that Becca’s Closet was no longer accepting dresses so the Long Island rep that has been working with the team referred them to Prom Boutique instead.
In the past, Prom Boutique’s focus was on girls who simply could not afford these beautiful and one-time use pieces of clothing. The dresses will be used not only for proms, but also for Sweet 16’s and graduations.
Guidance counselors chose the high school girls that are in need and recommended them directly to the Long Island Volunteer Center. Last year over 1,500 girls were served. The next distribution will take place in May at the Hagedorn Family Resource Center in Hempstead. This distribution is open to community members who cannot afford to purchase this type of item for an occasion they may be invited to.
“Our goal was to collect 24 dresses from our team of 12. Currently, we have 50. We hope this article will motivate our LIU community to bring in more dresses. Our new goal is 75 dresses,” exclaimed Daniels.
Dresses can be dropped off at either the front desk at the Pratt Center or information desk in Hillwood Commons up until Tuesday April 2, 2013.

The U.S. News and World Report ranking out of 51 master’s degree programs in library and information studies in the U.S. that are accredited by the American Library Association ranked LIU Post’s Palmer School of Library and Information Science 39.
Library Science is a program of study where students learn to catalogue, preserve and collect books and other documents.
Geraldine Kopczynski, academic advisor for Palmer, said that although it’s not the greatest ranking she is happy to be on the list. She added that the school hasn’t made the list in at least 15 years.
Caitlyn Wrigley, who studies Library Science at Palmer, stated that she is thrilled that her program has been recognized as one of the top in the nation. “It’s exciting and it’s a testament to the hard work of those who spend so much time to make it so wonderful; our administrators, and our faculty have a very strong presence within the profession,” Wrigley said.  “They both put their every effort into providing amazing opportunities for students to learn as much as possible and to develop the skills that will be necessary to be able to thrive in a job atmosphere that is rapidly evolving,” she added.
According to Kopczynski, the Palmer school stands out because of the various programs it offers, and how they offer them. “We have three different campuses; we rent space over at NYU, we’re over here [at Post] and we’re in Brentwood,” Kopczynski said. “We understand our student body—we try to connect with them and interact with them. We try to look around and see what our students need and we constantly review our curriculum,” she added.
One concentration within the curriculum is Rare Books and Special Librarianship; through the program students learn about rare books, how to identify the books, catalogue them, their history and how to preserve the books. Students in this program learn everything about rare books through electives that they choose to take.
Wrigley, who got her undergraduate degree from Manhattanville College in English Literature and American History, chose the Palmer School because of the opportunities the school provides for internship experiences in New York City. She also chose this school because the professors teaching the program have expertise in various fields of the library science profession.
“The Palmer School offers incredible support for professional development and advancement. The relationships they have forged with libraries, museums, historical societies, and other information institutions have provided students with amazing internship opportunities and most importantly a career path after graduation,” Wrigley added.
Kopczynski said that many students, and professionals, refuse to use the “L-word” [library]. “Some students don’t even consider themselves librarians; they consider themselves information brokers. I prefer the title information diva, but that’s just me.”
Students enrolled in the library science program are gaining the experience to be “information brokers.” There are many jobs that require a library science degree besides your typical public or school librarian. Some of these jobs include school media specialists, rare book and special collections specialists who work as archivists, law librarians and corporate librarians.
“You’re not strictly a librarian, you’re an information professional; and that has changed over the course of the last 10 years. Information professionals are used in all industries and in all different types of businesses as well as in education. Our programs prepare you to be an information professional,” said Heather Ranieri, director of marketing and recruitment of the Palmer School.
Ranieri added that a former student is doing archival work sorting old comics between the 1920s and the 1940s, while another former student is cataloging vintage jewelry in Manhattan with her degree. “There are so many different options with the degree,” Ranieri said.
Kopczynski, who is a Palmer school graduate herself, has noticed several changes within the program since she attended in 2000 besides the addition of technology. She recalls a core course in her curriculum called Technology for Information Management and said that her first assignment was to email the professor. The class doesn’t exist anymore because students are entering the program with experience using technology.
“The student body has gotten younger. When I first started it was mostly women coming back to school and they wanted to change their profession. They had their kids, their little ones were maybe four or five, and they wanted to go back to school to do something that they liked, Kopczynski said. “They wanted something that worked better for the family life. Now I’m seeing much younger students. I also see more diversity with men, women, and ethnicities; so that’s good,” she added.

Today, however, we seem to celebrate it in more of a spirit of tradition rather than remembering the origin of the holiday. With good reason, it is doubtful that running around hunting for Easter eggs, or hoping that the Easter bunny is going to visit our house, is an ancient tradition that originates in any religious books. But it is what it has become, a family holiday with the focus on the younger family members, on good food (and wine) and on candy.
In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes started the well-known White House Easter Egg Roll. In pairs, children push the eggs with a long spoon. This year’s roll, which will take place on April 1, will be the 135th roll.
In Scandinavian and other European countries, children wait for the Easter bunny to deliver one large Easter egg filled with candy. Some families also arrange Easter egg hunts with a twist; the children have to look for something called Kinder Eggs, which are German made chocolate eggs with a “surprise” in them, a small Lego-looking toy.
In England, families serve roasted ham for an early dinner on Easter Sunday. On that very same day, Greek families do it a little bit differently. They host large family parties outside in remembrance of Jesus’ resurrection.
Many countries serve ham or lamb for Easter, but in some places in Mexico, sea turtle meat is a tradition; although, hunting for sea turtles has been illegal for over a decade.
Former LIU Post student Anna Kurkina from Russia explained that they celebrate Easter differently in Russia. “Religious people go to church. The priest pours some [holy] water and sprinkles it over baskets that contain special bread called ‘pasha,’ wine, and some other food. It makes the food holy and we eat it in the morning.” They also do Easter eggs. “We have egg-fights. We paint the eggs in various colors and we try to break them. The one egg that doesn’t crack is a winner.”
Italian-American, liberal arts sophomore, Joseph Vertuccio, said, “Growing up, my parents would put Easter eggs all around the house with nickels and quarters and chocolate [inside]. We would also get big Easter baskets and depending on the year, we got more candy, video games, movies and stuffed animals.” He added that on Easter morning, his family goes out to eat a large dinner in the city.
No matter what your Easter traditions are, it is important to remember this holiday is a good time to spend with your family. With busy schedules and days, it’s often easy to forget to show the ones at home the appreciation they deserve.

The Pioneer recently spoke with A Rocket to the Moon lead singer Nick Santino. The pop-rock group consisting of Justin Richards on guitar, Eric Halvorsen on bass, and Andrew Cook on drums released its new EP “Wild & Free,” which features 13 new tracks including “Whole Lotta You,” “Somebody Out There” and “If I’m Gonna Fall In Love.” The band’s sophomore album was released on March 26, 2013, and is available for download on iTunes. You can follow A Rocket to the Moon on Twitter @ARTTM.
The Pioneer (TP):  “Wild & Free” is set to drop March 26. How did you choose the album title?
Nick Santino (NS): “Wild & Free” is something I had written in my iPhone notes for about three years now. For some reason, I always liked the idea of music being wild and free. I thought it was a good way to sum up our album in two words.
TP: Which of the new 13 tracks is your favorite and why?
NS: “If I’m Gonna Fall In Love” is one of my favorites. It has an awesome groove, the lyrics are fun and the overall vibe of the song is just fun.
TP: You immersed yourself in the Nashville scene to create “Wild & Free.” How does the actual Nashville scene compare to the one depicted in ABC’s TV series “Nashville”?
NS: Nashville is a great place. I’ve only watched a few episodes of the show. I liked how the locations in the show were accurate. It was cool to watch and see places that I knew and would go to. TV shows always take things a little too far but I’d say they did a good job at it. But Nashville is a place you have to experience on your own.
TP: The EP was produced by Mark Bright who worked with Rascal Flatts, Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire. What new elements were incorporated into your music from Bright?
NS: Mark is an amazing producer and an even better person. He brought a sense of freedom to the recording process. He had amazing ideas and would make us feel so comfortable about everything. He is a blessing to this band.
TP: The music video for “Ever Enough” features Disney star Debby Ryan, who is seen in a much different light than on the kid-friendly network. How was it working with Ryan?
NS: Debby is my best friend. We talk about everything together. If one of us has a bad day, the other one knows. She is a great person and so easy to work with. It was a comfortable video to make and we had a great time doing it.
TP:  Where do you find your inspiration?
NS: Everything. Just everyday life. Friends, family, love, regret. Everything.
TP: You started in a bedroom by posting a few songs on the Internet. What advice do you have for college students who want to get ahead or break into the business?
NS: You can’t give up. You never know when you’ll break. You could literally be a day away from the biggest day of your life and you’ll have no idea. If you give up, you’ll be missing out on the biggest thing to every happen to you.
TP: Tell us about one of your YOLO (you only live once) moments.
NS: Touring. I’m so grateful to be doing what I do. I’m 24 and I’ve seen so much of the world and I’ve gotten the pleasure to meet thousands and thousands of people that believe in what I do. It’s a truly great feeling.

With common knowledge brought on by ongoing media reports on the use of steroids and its effects, we have come to expect that professional athletes will get drug tested for the use of steroids or other enhancement drugs to make sure any sporting event is being played fairly. Drug testing is also fully accepted by college athletes. Certain jobs, such as the banking industry, also expect employees to take drug tests before being hired in order to guarantee that each employee will give their full potential to their company. If certain jobs and participating in sports teams require drug tests, why aren’t they required of entertainers, especially musical performers? What puts celebrities above the rest of us?
When rapper Lil Wayne was rushed to the hospital for reported seizures on Friday, March 14, it left his fans curious about the cause behind the situation when they reached out to Lil Wayne on Twitter.
According to MTV News, seizures can be accidentally stimulated by a concoction called “syrup, the name of a concoction of prescription-strength codeine cough syrup and a soft drink.” This is also referred commonly as “lean” or “sizzurp,” which leads to euphoric mental capacities. This simply means that the person who has “sizzurp” goes on “trips” as one on ecstasy or marijuana would have. Lil Wayne has admitted to using this drug before.
Lil Wayne’s website indicates that he has concert tours in Europe scheduled throughout the next few weeks. Because of his most recent seizure, his last one occurred in October, his concerts have without a doubt been cancelled until his recovery. This not only makes his fans feel concerned for his health, but disappointed about the cancellations.
With the thoughts of Lil Wayne’s seizures being possibly stimulated by his drug use and his fans being disappointed from not being able to go to his concert, the question comes back into mind, should musicians be drug tested?
It is no secret many musicians have overindulged in drugs or alcohol. Whether it was the Beatles or Amy Winehouse, most musicians have easy access to endless drugs and alcohol because of their wealth. Yet, just like any other person, a musician will be affected by drugs and the effects are always negative.
When a musician is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they will not perform to the best of their abilities for their audience. If a famous football player plays a football game under the influence of drugs or alcohol, fans would be angry that the athlete is getting paid millions of dollars to not do what he is expected to accomplish. If an athlete is caught doing drugs, they run the risk of being on probation, suspended for multiple games, or even suspended from their league.
In order for famous athletes to not fall into the path of drugs and alcohol as well as achieve maximum performance, drug testing is routine for professional sports leagues. This way, fans are getting what they are paying to see.
According to ABC News, the average concert ticket for the first half of 2012 was $46.69. With expensive prices, fans are entitled to the best performance possible. If a fan paid around $50 to see a performance and it was terrible or even cancelled because of the musician being under the influence of drugs, I personally would be upset.
Drug testing of musicians before concert performances is one way to minimize this disappointment of fans. If musicians were required to undergo drug tests and face somewhat the same repercussions of professional athletes for failing them, there would be public repercussions for their drug usage. Drug testing will also have musicians behave better, knowing that failing a drug test will get in the way of their performance. Performing at their best is a simple but heartfelt way to show respect for their fans; the people who put the musician where they are today.
Kelly Urbonas, a sophomore Criminal Justice major says, “I think it will keep them on the right track to recovery.”
Catiana Pereira, a freshman Childhood Education major says, “If musicians get drug tested I hope they’ll give the best of their abilities. I think that it will probably work out if they get drug tested because they’re going to want to continue performing.”
I believe that drug testing musicians would not only improve their performances but improve the music industry all together. When I see that a musician is using a lot of different drugs during performances, it makes me not want to go to the musician’s concert or even buy their work on iTunes. It shows that drugs come first to them and I don’t believe that the drugs should come close to being first in their life. It should be the fans, the people who are paying them to perform.

The women’s lacrosse team maintained its perfect record this week, defeat- ing the Dowling Golden
Lions 1613 on Wednesday, March 20, and the Bloomsburg Huskies 97 on Sunday, March 24.
The two victories move the Pioneers’ record to 70 on the season and 10 in conference play. They also remain ranked number one in NCAA Division II lacrosse.
Junior attacker Jackie Sileo set a new NCAA Division II ca- reer assists record in the win on Wednesday. The previous record was held by Adelphi’s Claire Peter- son, which was set in the 201011 season, and Sileo tied the record the game prior. She finished the game with six assists, along with four goals.
Sileo was the one who opened the scoring for the Pioneers against
the Golden Lions. She tallied her first goal of the afternoon at the 25:20 mark to tie the game at one. Dowling answered right back scor- ing two goals to jump in front 31.
But, the Pioneers scored four goals over the next five minutes to capture their first lead of the game. Junior attacker Morgan Chiarenza started the scoring at 15:22 of the first half. Less than a minute later Sileo scored her second goal of the game, followed by goals from junior midfielder Katie Rotan and senior attacker/midfielder Abbie Ross.
Dowling added three more goals in the half, including one with three seconds left in the first, but Sileo and Ross tagteamed to score three goals for the Pioneers to go into halftime with an 86 lead.
Senior attacker/midfielder Ashley Olen made it 96 just min- utes into the second half before Golden Lions’ sophomore attacker
Jackie Andersen cut the LIU Post lead to two. Ross scored less than a minute later, however the Golden Lions went on a run over the fol- lowing three minutes and took the lead off a goal from Andersen at 17:18.
The game was tied two more times before the Pioneers captured the lead for good in the final 10 minutes of the game. Olen scored twice in less than a minute and Ross scored at 8:59 to put the Pioneers ahead 1512. The Golden Lions scored one more time, but junior midfielder Samantha Losco added the insurance goal with 4:01 left to play and secured the LIU Post win.
The Pioneers played another close game on Saturday against the Huskies. This time it was Chiaren- za who scored the game’s first goal. Olen tallied backtoback goals fol- lowed by scores from Sileo, Rotan and another by Olen. Sophomore midfielder Julie Falk scored the
Huskies’ first goal of the game at the 11:06 mark of the first. Losco pushed the Pioneers lead back to six with a goal at 9:22. Bloomsburg added two more goals before the half ended and LIU Post notched one more with three seconds left in the first to go into halftime with an 83 lead.
Falk scored two goals at 19:36 and 18:47 of the second half to move within three points of the Pioneers.
Sophomore midfielder/de- fender Morgan Sherriff scored at 11:36 to make it a three point LIU Post lead and sophomore attacker Patrice Coleman scored with less than five minutes left to play in the game. But the Pioneers would hold the Huskies at bay and come away with the 97 victory.
The Pioneers have a week and a half off before their next con- test on April 3 when they travel to Dobbs Ferry, New York to battle the Mercy College Mavericks.

“The ban should have been passed,” said Kathy Isoldi, LIU professor and director of Nutrition, after Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Milton Tingling struck down Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s sugary drink portioncontrol legislation.
The banned drinks included soda, energy drinks and pre sweetened ice teas. The proposed restrictions would not apply to alcoholic or dairy-based beverages, diet sodas, fruit juices, and sugary drinks sold at grocery and convenience stores.
While sugarlovers rejoiced, some health advocates were not so happy. “This ban doesn’t impede on anyone’s rights and everyone should be invested in trying to create an environment that promotes health and helps people limit their intake of sugary beverages,” said Isoldi.
Isoldi has been in the field of nutrition for 32 years. She is a registered dietitian and was affiliated with New York Presbyterian Hospital. Her specialty is childhood obesity and she spent 22 years counseling obese individuals, children and adults, and preventing and treating the disease at an elementary school in East Harlem.
According to an LIU Post Nutritionist, Melissa Levine, people can enjoy sugar sweetened beverages from time to time in moderation. However, they should be aware that these drinks provide nothing more than empty calories with no nutritional
value. “Something to consider: A 20ounce bottle of regular soda
has about 16 teaspoons of sugar. Would you eat 16 teaspoons of sugar?” said Levine.
According to Isoldi, Mayor Bloomberg’s proposed ban would have helped to filter that. Instead of drinking the whole 32ounce soda, a consumer would have no choice but to only purchase the 16ounce. However, the ban did not factor in the loophole that consumers could buy multiple 16ounce drinks.
According to Isoldi, the economy has a role in the unhealthy choice. Many of the biggulp soda options are not much more expensive. A 32ounce soda costs roughly ten cents more than a 16ounce soda. “People could feel that they shouldn’t turn down a good bargain,” she added. “If you went shopping and purchased a beautiful outfit and someone said that for a dollar more you could buy a whole new outfit, most people would say ‘yes.’”
According to The American Heart Association, approximately 180,000 deaths worldwide are linked to sugary beverages every year.
According to Isoldi, “People are driven by different thingsand not necessarily to be healthy. Behavior is hard to change because we tend to stick to the status quo and the behavior is you get more [sugary drinks] for much less. I think we should try the ban in the specific locations [proposed by Bloomberg] to see if it changes behavior.”
Some students believe consumers should have the right to buy whatever size drink they want. “If someone wants to drinka biggulp soda, they should be allowed to,” said Alyssa Yannuzzi, a sophomore Public Relations major. “People are aware of the health risks and the choice is in their hands. No one should have to control the soda intake of people, it’s silly.”
“I believe [the ban] is a waste of time. People are going to eat and drink what they want to,” said Rafe Tangorra, a sophomore Broadcasting major. “Since when did the mayor decide our diet?”
Others argue that this ban could have possibly helped fight obesity because it would take away the option of choosing the larger
sugary drink and promote an environment that supports limits on unhealthy dietary options. In a single 12ounce can of Coke there are 39 grams of sugar and 140 calories.
At a press conference after the court’s denial of the ban, Mayor Bloomberg, stated that he would appeal the ruling.
“The plan wasn’t comprehensive enough, but it’s worth continuing to find the right way to institute this,” said Isoldi. “This is a public health issue that we all pay for; we are already paying for it with death, losing worker hours and diseases. Public health is an issue for the public.”

The word aloha has several meanings in the Hawaiian Pidgin language. It is used as hello, to express love, and to some natives, it is a lifestyle. Aloha also translates into goodbye, but goodbye is never right to say after a trip to Hawaii. When a week of kayaking next to sea turtles, volcano hiking, and swimming in waterfalls leaves you eager to explore more, then it isn’t goodbye – it’s so long.
There is without a doubt, a lot to do and explore on Oʻahu, the most populated of the 132island long chain that comprises the eight main islands of Hawaii, the 50th U.S. state. The Hawaiʻi Island, also known as Big Island, is the significantly largest, but Oʻahu, with an estimated one million inhabitants is the largest in population. This is also where the state capital, Honolulu, is located.
When approaching Honolulu in a hotel transfer bus from the airport, a little boy exclaims: “Look mommy, it looks just like Miami!” His spontaneous reaction upon seeing the Honolulu skyline was pretty spoton. The city, located on Oʻahu’s south shore, has numerous white, modern skyscrapers and tons of luxurious boutiques. There is a commercial touch significantly visible in the tourist (and spending) friendly Waikiki Beach, an area that stays crowded from early morning to late night. Waikiki Beach is great for shopping and dining. With food, there is a lot to choose from (try Duke’s and Roy’s for Hawaiian cuisine). But you should be willing to go beyond the shining surfaces of Honolulu and Waikiki; Oʻahu offers many experiences that are hard to find on the U.S. mainland.
One such experience is volcano hiking. Located close to Waikiki Beach lays Diamond Head, an overgrown volcano crater that has not been active for hundreds of years. In fact, it is so unlikely that it will erupt that the U.S. military has built its Hawaii base inside the crater. You get there by taking a local bus or a cab almost halfway to the top, pay an entry fee of $1 and reach the top in 40 minutes to enjoy a spectacular view over Honolulu and the deepblue Pacific Ocean.
Another adventurous idea is a oneday excursion that combines two activities for the price of $7689. (See thenorthshoresurfbus.com for more information.) A local guide with great knowledge of Hawaii picks you up outside your hotel and drives you to the Northwest side of Oʻahu. You then get to choose from a wide range of activities, such as snorkeling, biking, surfing, hiking and kayaking to name a few options. A hike through a botanical forest to a waterfall where you get to swim in fresh water that gives your body a renewing feeling, followed by kayak paddling in a delta inhabited by big sea turtles often come up next to your boat, are two alternatives wellworth the price.
There is time for lunch in between, and you can choose to have that in a botanical garden where peacocks in every green blue shade stroll around your table while you enjoy Hawaiian ahi (a type of tuna) tacos. You could also pick a restaurant in the small town of Haleʻiwa, a very traditional Hawaiian town where both natives and staff are very aloha spirited, meaning friendly, and helpful with a very relaxed attitude.
On Oʻahu’s eastern shores lay many world famous beaches. Kahlua and Lanikai are well known for their beauty, while Hanauma Bay is ideal for snorkeling and Makapuu Beach for body boarding. Beginner surfers would enjoy learning with an instructor at Waikiki Beach in the south shore, while advanced surfers may like some of the north shore beaches better. Hawaii is very surferfriendly and there are waves of all sizes depending on where you go. Where’s a better place to try it? After all, Hawaii is the home of surfing.
And then there are a bunch of free activities, some of which reflect the kindness of the natives. On Fridays and Saturdays, people gather around locals who perform hula shows on the Waikiki Beach boardwalk for free; therefore, you can skip ordering a paid hula show dinner. On Fridays at 7:45pm, there is a fireworks show at Waikiki Beach that follows sunset. The sunset itself is incredible. The Pacific Ocean meets the horizon while the sun quickly lowers towards a multicolored sky in every yellow, red, pink and blue nuance there is. If lucky, look towards the ocean and see if you can catch a glimpse of whales whipping their gigantic tales or water coming up of their blowholes.
Finally, don’t miss going to the Pearl Harbor area, where you can look at the Arizona Memorial, the USS Missouri ship, go onboard the US Bowfin Submarine and look at the airplanes and helicopters the Aviation Museum. Local buses from Waikiki can take you there for $2.50 and the entrance fee will be somewhere between $4560 depending on how many of the attractions you want to see, so there is really no reason apart from comfort to chose a twicetheprice tour that many Hawaiian companies offer.
Oʻahu is a colorful island where many unique activities are offered by a friendly population. A ticket from New York does not have to cost more than $700 (see sites like mrjet.com). When starting to plan a summer trip, keep in mind this unique destination that will be hard to forget.

From fun, feminine clothes  to studded shorts and leather jackets, there is something about spring fashion sure to suit everyone. Spring trends are hitting retail stores, as the season slowly begins to change. As a college student on a budget, it can be depressing seeing all the new clothes and not being able to splurge on the most coveted items.
Spring is a time when jackets are not only instyle, but needed. With the weather slowly starting to warm up, pairing a jacket with a summer outfit is an effortless way to stay warm. Right now, denim vests are trendy. They can be purchased at retailers such as Bloomingdales and Nordstrom costing between $50.00$70.00. If you do not want to purchase one, you can make one yourself; simply cut the sleeves off a denim jacket you no longer use!
Leather jackets are also in for spring, especially colored ones, such as beige, gray and blue and ones with studs. Piperlime.com sells a studded leather jacket for $80.00.
Popular stores for college students including, Urban Outtfitters, Victoria Secret’s, Anthropologie and Abercrombie, are close by in Americana Manhasset on Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City on Old Country Road. Victoria’s Secret sells popular spring items like shorts, cropped sweatpants, hooded jackets and classic v neck tees. They always have coupon deals and online sales. For the shirts, they offer a 2 for $40.00 deal.
Other stores, geared towards college students that are also close to campus include Ruby and Jenna in Plainview on South Oyster Bay Road, Reign Boutique on Merrick Road and Lester’s in Greenvale on Northern Boulevard. Lauren Pizzimenti, a sophomore Health Sciences major and Business minor, said, “The Wheatley Plaza Shopping Center on Glen Cove Road at Northern Boulevard in Greenvale has stores like Scoop NYC and
Vince Camuto, but those are definitely more expensive.”
There are many different ways to look like you just left the runway without having to pay the high fashion prices. Websites such as Nastygal.com and Toby.com have clothes at cheaper prices. Also, register for discount sites like Hautelook.com and Ruelala.com that have different brands and designers everyday at discounted prices.
Shorts are guaranteed to make an appearance during spring weather. There is nothing better than feeling the sun on your skin for the first time in months. Denim shorts, ripped and studded, are trendy right now. An alternative to purchasing shorts can be to cut old jeans into shorts. With a stud kit, you can easily add studs to your shorts without spending money. For those of us who are less crafty, shorts can be purchased from retailers like Lester’s, Free People, Lord and Taylor, and many others. Brands like 7 For All Mankind, Citizens of Humanity, True Religion, and Joe’s Jeans offer a variety of denim shades and styles.
Shorts, jeans, pants and skirts can be worn with virtually anything on top. Throw on a baby doll top, a tight fitting tank, a leather jacket, or a cozy sweater. “My favorite spring clothes are jeans and a cute sweater or long sleeve off the shoulder with ballet flats or boots,” said Pizzimenti. “I wear gold jewelry only and always my watch.”
Day dresses and maxi dresses are a must have item in spring. They are not only comfortable and stylish, but they are so easy to just throw on in the morning and go on with the day. Floral print and bright colored dresses are fun to wear in the spring. Wear dresses with a jacket and flip flops or wedges.
Spring shoes include wedges and t sandals. Brands like Sam Edelman and DV Dolce Vita sell for $60.00 and they can be purchased from Nordstrom or Bloomingdales. For cheaper prices, go to Zappos.com, they sell hundreds of shoe brands, and have free shipping and returns.
Havaianas have adorable flip flops and are relatively cheap. They can be purchased at Havaianas.com as well as many retailers. Designer Tory Burch also has fun patterned and colored flip flops for the spring, but they are a bit pricey, starting at $60.00 and get as expensive as $300.00.
“I personally love the Tory Burch flip flops. They are expensive but I feel most shoes are,” said Alyssa Yannuzzi, a sophomore Public Relations major. “I wear mine almost every day during the summertime.”
Of course, sunglasses become an accessory worn on most once the weather heats up. “Sunglasses are my favorite accessory to every outfit and my Rebecca Minkoff
black tote,” said Pizzimenti. The most popular sunglasses would be designer like the RayBan Aviators and Wayfarers. Other designers like Michael Kors, Burberry, and Coach also have highly coveted sunglasses. These are all a bit pricey, usually starting from $150.00. If you can’t splurge, you can buy a pair cheap for about $30.00 at Urban Outfitters, Zara, or Topshop, among others.
Without paying expensive prices for spring fashions, a girl can still look stylish and put together. Try some DIYs and buy clothes early at discounted prices. Save your money for the summer parties, and still look fashionable while attending.

“The Place Beyond the Pines” is an unforgettable drama that truly captures the essence of the bond between father and son. It delivers three authentic stories that each connect to the last. In each of the stories, we learn that choices change lives.
Ryan Gosling plays Luke, a traveling motorcyclist who, after returning to Schenectady, New York, after a year on the road, finds out he has a son with a former lover, Romina (Eva Mendes). To provide for his son, he uses his only skill set: robbing banks and using his motorcycle for a quick getaway. Halfway through the movie, Bradley Cooper is introduced as Avery Cross, a cop fresh on the scene, who tried to tail Luke. After a confrontation between the two, the consequences reverberate into the next generation. Their sons, Jason (Dane DeHaan) and A.J. (Emory Cohen), must face their fateful, shared legacy.
Each character has their own agenda, although the mindset of providing for the family is what keeps them going. Both Gosling and Cooper have a huge presence on screen and they really do a great job at portraying their characters. The movie is much more interesting than I make it seem, trust me. Choices do not only change your life, but the choices you make pass on down to your children. “The Place Beyond The Pines” nails this theme right on head. The movie is from Derek Cianfrance, the director of Blue Valentine.
“The Place Beyond The Pines” is a new, fresh drama that deserves attention. With a strong cast, moving score and pure cinematic genius, it is definitely something worth experiencing. “The Place Beyond the Pines” hits select theaters this Friday.

On March 10, the Pioneer attended a college press conference with the cast of “Place Beyond the Pines,” which debuts in select theaters this Friday. Actors Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes, Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen joined Director/Writer Derek Cianfrance to discuss the drama that explores the unbreakable bond between fathers and sons.
In the film, Luke (Ryan Gosling) passes through Schenectady, New York, and tries to reconnect with a former lover, Romina (Eva Mendes). He learns that she has given birth to their son, Jason, and resolves to forsake life on the road and provide for his newfound family. After a string of bank robberies, rookie cop Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) confronts Luke sending the consequences reverberating into the next generation.
“A number of years ago, when Ryan and I were working on the script for Blue Valentine, we started talking about this fantasy [that] Ryan always had of robbing a bank on a motorcycle,” said Cianfrance. “And I said, ‘You’ve gotta be kidding me because I’m writing that movie right now.’ We both imagined it in the identical way. It was one of several moments when I knew we were meant to make films together.”
The film was shot over a period of 47 days last summer in Schenectady, New York. For authenticity, locations included a functioning police station with real officers, a live hospital with real nurses and patients and real banks with real bank tellers and bank managers who had been robbed before.
“Derek had the idea of working in the diner that my character works at,” said Mendes. “I was like, cool, yeah. I went and got to know the people that worked there and their families and their stories. It was great because a lot of people didn’t recognize me. They were hungry, they wanted their food fast or I didn’t get a tip. It was a great idea because honestly, I wouldn’t have thought of it.”
Production was canceled for one day when Hurricane Irene struck. Equipment trucks were buried under water and the camera department took a canoe out and rescued two days worth of footage. When combined, the footage tells three linear stories about a motorcycle stunt rider who turns to a life of crime to support his newborn son, an ambitious rookie cop who takes on a corrupt police department rather than confront his own demons and two troubled teenage boys who confront the mysteries of their past by battling each other.
“It was pretty compartmentalized,” said Gosling. “We were all pretty excited about that structure because you have to admire Derek, he can be frustrating at times and everybody told him to cut it, to change it, and not to do it that way. What he has done is take all the conventions of the reasons why you go to the movies—the heist, the crime drama and family drama, thriller—you have all those things that you love but constructed in a way that to experience them in a different way.”
The movie was partially inspired by Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho,” due to the stories hand off of main characters from Janet Leigh’s Marion Crane to Tony Perkins’s Norman Bates. Cianfrance wanted characters who would have real consequences for their actions—where guns come into the movie and actually have an effect.
“Ryan has this incredible presence and charisma on the screen and in real life,” said Cianfrance. “He’s inherently interesting and cinematic and is just such an amazing human being who just makes everyone better around him. He is a magic man. When I met Bradley, he had that same kind of incredible charisma that Ryan has. But the thing that really convinced me on Bradley more than anything else was how hard he worked. After meeting with Bradley a couple of times I went back to the script and completely re-wrote the character for him because I knew he could go deep. Much deeper than I originally had suspected.”

In 2006, A Rocket to the Moon was formed by Nick Santino, lead vocalist and guitarist, in Braintree, Massachusetts. Justin Richards, guitarist and backup vocalist, Eric Halvorsen, bassist and backup vocalist, and Andrew Cook, drummer eventually joined to complete A Rocket to the Moon. The band is currently signed to the label Fueled By Ramen, which has produced music for Paramore, Gym Class Heroes, Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco.
A Rocket to the Moon’s first album, “Your Best Idea,” was independently produced in 2006. The band’s debut album produced by FBR, “On Your Side,” was released on October 13, 2009, and the newest album, “Wild and Free,” was released this past Tuesday. As a mullet and pop culture-loving gal, I try to experience different kinds of genres and generations of music. I gladly reviewed “Wild and Free” because I have actually seen the band in concert, when they opened for Boys Like Girls. A Rocket to the Moon had an alternative rock/pop sound, which was similar to Boys Like Girls. The band members were fun and they had the audience going. I was a very impressed teen.
After listening to “Wild and Free” three times, I found that the band’s sound has completely changed from alternative rock to country. As a fan, I was not expecting a completely new sound but then I realized that A Rocket to the Moon has made a dramatic change in their sound before. “Your Best Idea” also had a very different sound than “On Your Side.” “Your Best Idea” had a very purposely auto tuned sound overall. It was not a great sound to me. Some other fans may have liked it, but there might have been a reason why the band changed to alternative when it signed with FBR.
A Rocket to the Moon had a great thing going on with the last album and its alternative rock/pop theme. The songs where catchy and cute and I enjoyed listening to them. The majority of the songs were very memorable as well. However, this new album was not fun. It sounded similar to an old Train album but less upbeat. There is a dramatic difference between this album and the band’s previous ones but some bands must changes and mature their sound. I give the band kudos for being brave enough to take such a risk. Obviously, A Rocket to the Moon did not have the sound it wanted but perhaps the third time is the charm.

I feel it’s about time I did a little bit of guy bashing. Why is it that men feel the need to flirt with other girls while they have a girlfriend? Now, don’t go jumping to conclusions. I’m not talking about a little harmless flirting once and a while. I’m talking about blatantly flirting on the regular with girls.
Not only is it disrespectful to the poor soul who’s dating you, but also can be quite perplexing to the female you are flirting with. When you go out of your way to text her or whatever it is that you’re doing, it sends mixed signals. On the one hand we know you are not available, on the other it’s as if you are implying that you are unhappy in your relationship and may want to end it. What is your ultimate purpose with this flirting?
Is it just a male ego complex? You’ve been off the market for a small amount of time and feel it’s necessary to see if you “still have it?” I know every guy walks around thinking he’s God’s gift to women everywhere but,
really? It’s slightly ridiculous and makes you look like a complete ahole. What’s a girl to do? If your girlfriend were to find out about the texts and tweets, etc. she would most likely go straight to the girl you’ve been flirting with and freak out. Watch while the catfight ensues, be- cause it will. Is it really her fault though? Should she stand there and take the responsibility for the whole situation, especially when it was the faulty boyfriend who started the entire flirting ordeal in the first
place? Absolutely not. This poor girl was essentially being led on by this dumbdumb and
was just along for the ride. Now she’s supposed to take the fall for you? Think again buddy. In no way is that fair. What you should have done was just kept it a casual flirting thing once and a while, now you’ve created quite a mess. Not only did you hurt one girl, you hurt two; on top of it all, both of them most likely want to kick you right in the baby maker. (Sorry if you are wincing as you read this)
Bottom line, either break up with your girlfriend or keep it in your virtual panties. I highly doubt anyone wants to be put in the middle of this situation.

When are facial piercings appropriate? Who decides whether or not piercing your body is right or wrong? Does age play a factor? I personally love facial piercings. I think they give people an edgy look. My favorite facial piercing are nose rings. Yet, I am too scared to actually get one. Our generation is evolving from the old fashioned cleancut style to a generation with piercings, colored hair and tattoos.
I don’t think piercings dictate what type of a person someone is; instead it describes their sense of style. Having facial piercings doesn’t make someone a bad person. I believe that when people do have facial piercings they are showing off a badass or rebellious style. Maybe I think this because you have to be brave to put a needle through your face.
Junior Broadcasting major, Lauren Thomas, believes that there is a stigma to people who have facial piercings. Thomas said, “People look at them and say, ‘Oh there’s THAT person,’ especially in the work place.” Thomas thinks that bosses in today’s workforce are older and more conservative, and believes that they look down on facial piercings. “They believe you need to be plain and be dressed appropriately which means no hair dye and no piercings,” added Thomas.
In the younger generations, I feel that it is common to see people with facial piercings. You don’t really think badly about it when you see it; it has become a part of the culture. The kids of our generation have piercings and tattoos and they will become the bosses of the next generation. I think that as time goes on everyone will become more accepting to this new era of style because it is so prevalent.
Junior Public Relations major, Andria Osler, used to date a piercer. “I was really attracted to piercings; I thought they were really cool,” she said. Osler had 13 piercings but never had anything on her face pierced. She had 12 piercings in her ears and her bellybutton. Today she only has a few in her ears and her bellybutton. “Now I realized that I can’t put anything on my face; otherwise no one will take me seriously,” explained Osler. She now feels that facial piercings are unattractive. However, her mom, who is 55, has her nose pierced. Olser said, “It looks classy on her; she just has a small stud.” Osler explained that her mom doesn’t work in a corporate office but at a spa in Port Washington and that no one there has a problem with it. I don’t think that there should be an age limit on piercings; everyone has the right to do what they want to their body.
Junior Public Relations major, Kerry Evans, got her nosed pierced when she was 16 years old. “I got my nose pierced during my alternative phase. I also wanted my tongue pierced,” said Evans. “When I was 19, I got my nose repierced, since it had closed. I started dating my current boyfriend and he didn’t like my nose ring so I took it out,” Evans said. She believes that the nose is a very common piercing; therefore it’s not something extreme.
Facial piercings are no different than the way you choose to dress, style your hair or put on makeup. I believe it is a way to express yourself and your style. People shouldn’t be judged by their piercings. It’s just a style.

Earlier this year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) voted to raise the base fare on subways and buses from $2.25 to $2.50, effective on March 1. They also increased the cost of the 30day MetroCard from $104, to $112. On MTA’s website, MTA Chairman and CEO Joseph J. Lhota states, “[It is] costs that the MTA does not exercise control over, namely those for debt service, pensions, energy, paratransit, and employee and retiree health care, continue to increase beyond the rate of inflation.”
However, what residents of Long Island dreaded the most was the increase in Long Island Rail Road ticket fare. On March 1, the prices were raised between 8.19 percent and 9.31 percent, depending on the ticket type and distance. For many, the LIRR is the only way to get into the city, and this leaves a lot of students at Post very frustrated. For instance, it is now nine dollars for an offpeak to ride from Hicksville into the city.
Kent Johansson, a junior Theater major, lives on campus and is not happy with this change. Johansson stated, “Taking the bus and buying an MTA card is much more expensive now after the price increased.” Johansson objected to the price increase since he does not have any other choice and, for many students, every penny counts. Johansson continued, “Bus is the only alternative to get off campus when the shuttle bus stops going.”
Petter Holmsen, a junior Film major who commutes by car to school from Glen Cove, believes that it is too expensive as well. Holmsen stated, “It’s too expensive, but hey: this is America. They [MTA] got the power. For my roommates and I, it is easier and cheaper to buy a car. Instead of riding public transportation everywhere, and all over the Island to get to where one is going, it is better to have a car. I would love to ride public transportation, but it is too expensive, and the offer [schedule and locations] is very poor,” said Holmsen.
Cato Benjaminsen, a junior Finance major, lives off campus but states that he is not that impacted. “Even though I am taking the LIRR and the bus to school, I am not that affected by the new prices since I am only at school two days a week. Of course it is expensive, and it’s bad that it is getting even more expensive. Next semester I have to have class three days a week, so it might be cheaper getting a car with my girlfriend.”
It is evident that a lot of people all around the New York area will be affected by this price increase, LIU Post being no exception. Students on campus are more or less affected by this. Some students live on campus and don’t go offcampus except in the free shuttle transportation that LIU Post provides to nearby locations such as Hicksville station and Broadway mall, a perfect way to avoid the ticket charge on a regular bus, while commuters are more heavily impacted. However, some commuters go by car and can avoid the issue all together, even though other issues like rising gas costs can be a problem.
For me, the prices affect me tremendously, since I am a commuter that usually goes by bus. I also use the Long Island Rail Road almost every weekend to go into the city and use the subway while I’m there. However, the reason they raised the price seems appropriate and I accept the fact that they made that decision, but nevertheless I’m still bummed out since I won’t have as much money in my pocket.

A common occurrence within society today is for the preceding generation to comment on the flaws of the succeeding generation. One of the more controversial issues pertaining to the current youth of America is the topic of kids who “sag.” Teenagers who “sag” wear their pants low enough to a point where their buttock is exposed.
There has been talk for a while about making it illegal for people to wear sagging clothes, but until this year, nothing had been set in stone. The General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts addresses “Crimes Against Chastity, Morality, Decency, and Good Order”–reading: “a man or woman, married or unmarried, who is guilty of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than three years or in jail for not more than two years or by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.”
In January, the Black Mental Health Alliance of Massachusetts launched a public service campaign warning teenagers about future fines and possible imprisonment due to “saggy” pants.
In the PSA created by the BMHAM, there is a male dressed in a police officer’s attire stating that in Boston, one can be fined $300 or imprisoned for a maximum of three years for wearing sagging pants. In Massachusetts, it is considered an obscene offense to dress inappropriately. As the officer in the campaign warns the teens to pull up their pants, he states “It’s the law!”
The PSA’s main focus was to let it be known that they want the youth to respect themselves, and respect their community. BMHAM, the association which released this PSA, shared that it is their belief that saggy pants heighten thug-like behavior and contribute to how young men are perceived and treated by police, teachers and other adults.
According to a February 2013 article by Meghan E. Irons in the Boston Globe, “Suffolk County prosecutors said the alliance is basing its premise on a loose interpretation of state law on open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior. They [Suffolk County prosecutors] say they would never press charges on anyone for what some consider a fashion faux pas.”
When informed of Massachusetts’s crack-down on saggy pants, freshman Kevin Guardia, an undecided major said, “I don’t even wear my pants like that but I think it’s crazy that the government is now trying to lock teenagers up for the way they wear their clothes. If prison is involved for some of these young kids, it will be on their record and follow them for the rest of their lives.”
When asked for an opinion on the new law, sophomore Melissa Weisman, a Film major, stated, “No, I do not agree with people wearing their clothes like that, but I do not think that it should be pushed to such an extreme like prison!”
Others strongly support the new law. Omar Reid, a 54-year-old education psychologist from Grove Hall who is helping to lead the ad campaign in Boston told the Boston Globe, “Our community and our people are tired of these kids walking around like this.”
In desperate attempts to expand their ad, the campaign against saggy pants spends an average of $2,000 a month on having the ad released in more areas. Reid stated in the article that they are not trying to single out teenagers. Their main focus is to get the youth to understand how critical of a role appearance and image play in life.
Many people can agree that they are tired of seeing the backsides of so many teenagers and young adults. However, can those people agree that putting these teens in prison is not going too far? Personally, I feel that the law is a bit extreme. Although I do not appreciate seeing young teens showing off their underwear, I do not think that they should pay such a large fine or be put in prison.

Imagine being a young kid, thirteen years old, going to your first summer football camp. You’re so excited to see your friends, throwing the old pigskin. Then, imagine being brutally raped, tormented, and bullied by older boys who threatened to hurt or kill you if you ever spoke a word. Imagine wanting to tell your coach, who kept telling you that no one would believe you. Imagine coming home and living in fear that you can’t tell anyone, not even your parents.
This is what the victims of the Mepham High School football camp, located in Pennsylvania, faced from the time they arrived at the summer camp until the return home in 2003. Mepham High School itself is located in Bellmore, N.Y. and their football team, known as the “Pirates” was one of the top athletic teams on Long Island. But what does this say about our society? Is rape something that should be brushed aside when it involves potentially high profile athletes? Or should we accept rape as normal in our society? This is what is known as rape culture and it is something the American public should be fully aware of. Sadly, this is not the latest news of victimization in young children.
In 2012, former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted of 56 counts of child molestation and aggravated sexual assault, and was sentenced to a minimum of 60 years behind bars. This went on for nearly 15 years while he worked with the Penn State football team, as he brought young boys into the locker rooms and washrooms. No one said a word, and even prestigious ex-coach Joe Paterno turned a blind eye to Sandusky’s atrocious behavior. Jack Thedinga, a sophomore Political Science major said, “I went to PSU the year before the Sandusky scandal hit so it really hit home for me. I’d worked alongside Sandusky once in his charity and I thought he seemed like a great guy at the time. Obviously in hindsight I’m appalled at what transpired…We have become part of a system that accepts rape as an inevitability in society, and not the abhorrent anomaly it should be.”
In the most recent news, spanning from August 2012 until the trial on March 18th, 2013, two high school football athletes, Ma’lik Richardson, 16, and Trent Mays, 17, were convicted and charged with aggravated sexual assault on a minor. The incident took place at a Steubenville, Ohio house party. For three consecutive days, these boys took advantage of a 16 year-old girl while she was intoxicated. When she tried to report the incident to local authorities and teachers, they told her to keep her mouth shut. Eventually, word of this case went viral when videos and photos of the girl surfaced on the Internet. These boys made jokes through text messages about how she “deserved it” and “we raped her.”
It wasn’t long after that the Internet vigilantes, known as “Anonymous,” would release personal information of both boys and a local cop who the victim reported to. They vowed that justice would be served, and have proven thus far by attracting media attention to the case. Without the help of these people, the case may have gone unseen, like the Sandusky and Mepham cases had for so long. On March 18, the boys went to trial in an Ohio state court. They were found guilty, but only sentenced to one-year probation and ordered a no-contact rule until themselves and their victim were 21 years old.
When interviewing students about the incidents of rape and how they were handled, Rachel Mahler, a senior Earth Science Education major said, “I believe that anyone who could destroy someone else like that should face the consequences and they should be punished to the full extent. Why should they get off easy when their victims will have to live with it their whole life?”
Sports culture has always been about the brotherhood of the sport, the fun of the game, and friendly competition. What is shocking in all three cases is that people told the victims to keep quiet about this. Why should anyone suffer through this mental and physical torture while these rapists get away with it. Peers even spoke out against the victims of the Mepham case, calling the boys “fags” and “broomstick boy.”
Our own virtues of respecting humans are diminishing, and it is becoming more acceptable to blame the victim rather than the attacker. In protest to this, women every year go on a walk to raise awareness of our rape culture and “slut shaming.” This event is known as “The Slut Walk.” There are also various organizations that help rally volunteers and bring an understanding to those victimized by rape. We must also realize that rape is not gendered. Men, women, and children alike can all be victims.

A classic competition in bars all over the world is armwrestling. Enormous amounts of beer is lost, or won, every Saturday over this form of competition. If you are not an anabolicgymrat, you probably have lost more than you won over the years. Well, here is the solution for you: Toe Wrestling.
Yes, the competition is exactly what it sounds like, a far relative to the arm wrestling, where the ultimate goal is to out conquer your opposition and smash his toe to the ground. With shoes off, the competitors face each other toe-to-toe across the ‘toedium,’ where they interlock their big toes and try to force each other to touch the foot rest on the opponent’s side. This motion is called a “Toe Down” and wins you the set.
Every matchup has three legs: right big toe, left big toe and right big toe again (if a decider is needed). The game is started and decided by a referee, who screams, “Toes Away” to start the competition. You can win a set by either successfully performing a “Toe Down,” or a competitor may surrender by calling out the words “Toe Much.” The winning toewrestler must then release their toe-hold immediately.
If you are worried about the hygiene at a toe wrestling championship you don’t have to, as all competitors need to have their feet inspected for any funny business; such as, hidden daggers or fungus between their webbed weapons. It is also common courtesy that you help your opponent with taking off shoes and socks before entering the ‘toedium’ if needed. This tradition dates all the way back to the first World Toe Wrestling Competition held in Derbyshire, UK.
Toe Wrestling is not a new sport, as it can be dated all the way back to 1976 and even further in various homes throughout the world. Toe wrestling, and its less popular cousin thumb wrestling, has been popular child games for decades. While thumb wrestling is still not accepted as an official sport, toe wrestling has its own annual World Championship and in 1997 its originators applied for it to be inducted to the official Olympic program. The application was notsurprisingly denied.
Even with the set back in 1997, the sport has kept growing over the last 10 years and the number of participants has been increasing. Still, a few people have dominated the sport since the 2000s. On the men’s side, either Alan “Nasty” Nash or Paul “Toeminator” Beech have been on the top of the podium since the start of the new millennium. On the women’s side, Lisa “Twinkle Toes” Shenton, and Heather “Mrs. Toeminator” Beech have been the predominant figures.
For most, the next World Championship in Derbyshire, England, on July 14, is too soon, and you should focus on smaller events first. Head out to the garage and build your own “toedium” and battle to be the neighborhood champion. Just make sure you get yourself a proper artist name and make sure you tell your neighbors to wash their feet before the competition. If you don’t fancy getting to know your neighbor’s toes this close, you could always invite them to a game of TicTacToe instead…

LIU Post offers a wide variety of classes to its students. Now, the martial arts styling of aikido is one of them.
The class has been in the works for a while, but only recently has gained momentum. The last time the class was offered it did not work for many students who were interested in taking it. The class was originally allotted a time slot of 11:30 a.m. to 12:25p.m. The class has now been moved to Fridays from 10 a.m. to 11:50 a.m. and will be conducted by Robert Waltzer, or as he’s known to his students: Waltzer Sensei.
Waltzer has been practicing martial arts for 43 years, and along
with a strong knowledge of aikido he knows karate and jujitsu. He describes the difference between aikido and other martial arts; aikido is strictly a selfdefense art that emphasizes footwork, while karate is an offensive art. “It’s more similar to an aspect of using the person’s energy, rather than karate uses force against force and steps back and blocks the person. But that person is still in front of you. Where Aikido really empha- sizes a lot of footwork,” he said.
“When the New York Times came and did an article about self defense, the person that did the article looked at me and watched what I was doing,” Waltzer said. “I don’t know why, but he compared it to a matador, meaning that when somebody is much bigger and
coming at you, you’re deflecting and redirecting, rather than clash- ing with it,” he added.
Aikido is also considered especially helpful for women and smaller people.
“I did karate for 18 years and I can tell you the Aikido is much more practical,” Waltzer said. “It is much more on a defensive side and works much better with a smaller person who has a much bigger person as an adversary.”
The class at Post will teach students how to fall properly, as well as defensive moves in the event they ever are attacked.
“I teach people how to fall properly, how to roll properly and when a new student at Post starts they would learn defensive moves if they were being grabbed,” Waltz-
er said. “Whether that’s grabbed by their wrist, whether they’re grabbed from the front to the back and as the session progresses they would be learning each time more defensive maneuvers. So the bot- tom line is they’re not being taught to fight, they’re being taught to protect themselves.”
Waltzer believes that the class is useful and will help students. “I think it’s really beneficial to the students and I think that’s why I really want to get in there to teach them,” he said.
The class will run the rest of the semester in the racquetball court at the Pratt Center. Students who are interested in attending the class can contact Kent Hatch by email or show up to racquetball courts on Friday at 10 a.m.

The Pioneers dominated Mercy College on Saturday, March 23 in both games of a double-header, defeating the Mavericks 12-4 and 7-2. The matchups against Mercy (7-10) marked the first two East Coast Conference games for the Pioneers this season, as well as the first home games of the year. The Pioneers started off the 2013 campaign with a ten-game trip down to Kissimmee, Florida in the Rebel Spring Games.
In the first contest on Saturday afternoon, the Pioneers (9-4) jumped out to a quick start scoring nine runs through the first three innings. Freshman catcher, Paige Swantek, smacked a three-run double to begin the onslaught. In the bottom of the second inning, the Pioneers added two more runs without even hitting the ball. Junior shortstop, Nicole Hagenah, and sophomore catcher, Aly Dzierzynski, each walked with the bases loaded to make it 5-0 in favor of LIU Post.
The Mavericks made things interesting with a three-run third inning, but the Pioneers responded back with four runs in the bottom half of the inning. Sophomore leftfielder, Catherine Havens, and Hegenah, both drove in a run with RBI singles.
Pioneers’ junior pitcher, Liz Weber (5-3), a member of the 2012 ECC First Team, went the distance. She threw six innings, allowing two runs and striking out five batters.
The latter half of the double dip was more competitive. The score was evened up at one until the bottom of the fourth inning when the Pioneers put up a crooked number on the scoreboard. LIU Post had a six-run inning which ultimately was enough for the win behind the strong effort of sophomore pitcher, Megan Salcido (2-0). She threw seven innings allowing only one earned run.
Hegenah and Dzierzynski led the way for the Pioneers as both players had two RBI’s. Dzierzynski has driven in at least one run in four consecutive games.
The next time the Pioneers are in action is on Thursday, March 28 as they square off in a double-header against Stonehill College (8-12) at 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.
