With just a month into the new year and starting spring semester, I can’t help but feel like it’s time to, in a way, start all over again. Although it’s the second semester of the year it still feels like it’s a good opportunity to have a blank slate and do things that we perhaps wanted to do last semester but just didn’t have the time to, like for example, joining a club on campus.
Joining a club in college can sometimes be time consuming but I have to say it’s extremely beneficial. During my first few years of college I was the type of person that tried to get into campus clubs, went to the first meetings, but then just stopped going because I felt as if I didn’t have time. Now, in my senior year of college and being a member of a club for almost two years, I have to say that I wish I stuck it out and joined more clubs in the very beginning.
Clubs don’t only allow you to meet new people on campus but they also allow you to network and prosper professionally. Most, if not all, of the resume workshops I’ve attended in the past three years have discussed how important it is to join clubs. Having a resume filled with clubs and organizations will stand out more than just a resume of your education and classes.
Not all students feel the same. Stephanie Rozza, a senior accounting major, claims that with all her classes, work, and being a commuter she really doesn’t have the time to join clubs. “It’s really hard when you not only are a full time student but also have jobs,” she said. “I’ve tried to look into it but every semester I usually have class or have to work during the time they meet.”
Rozza believes that her major courses and her jobs come first. “I do agree that it’s good to join clubs but for me there just isn’t enough time,” she said. “I like to prioritize my time and classes and jobs are always above the clubs on campus. If I had more time, I’d definitely think of joining a club or two.”
A big factor that interferes or prevents people from joining clubs is being a commuter student. Rozza and other students may feel that way since they don’t have the convenience of living on campus; it becomes more difficult for them to connect to all clubs’ activities. “The reason I am not part of any club is not only time-wise,” Rozza said. “I have a 45 minute commute and I don’t tend to be on campus every single day so that doesn’t make it any easier for me to be motivated to join.”
On the other hand, some commuters find a way to still commit to on campus clubs, like for example Marianna Scalise, who graduated in January 2015 with a BA in psychology. “I think it’s important to be a part of something you stand for in college,” she said. “Because that’s where you really get to meet other individuals who share the same ideas and beliefs.”
During her last semester, Scalise held the position of President of the Rainbow Alliance club. “It is definitely something that jobs or internships like to see,” Scalise said. “Going to college of course provides you with more opportunities but being a part of a club goes beyond what they ask for.”
It’s important to realize that everything worthwhile takes work, therefore although clubs are definitely time consuming, it does pay off to be part of one. On the other hand it’s also understandable to prioritize and if a club just doesn’t fit into your schedule maybe there are ways to even make small contributions.

Most of us start college expecting to only take classes related to our majors. Personally, at my high school, the classes I had to take were already chosen for me. I didn’t have a choice in taking a subject that I might be interested in; I was never given an option; all classes that I was required to take were the only ones offered to me.
Coming to college, I always thought, “There is no way I am taking a class that is probably not beneficial for my major.” I didn’t want to think of taking math or science again and I hated the fact that I had to take the core classes as it was. Taking any class outside my major wasn’t in my thought process.
What’s funny though is that through taking one of these so called core requirements, I found myself falling in love with a different major and eventually making it my minor.
Having studied two different types of fields, I realized that, although taking classes outside of your major might sometimes make you feel like you are wasting your time and perhaps money you really aren’t. You might discover something new you are passionate about, or that class might actually be beneficial to your future in the professional world. Everything overlaps; therefore; taking classes that may have little to do with what you are studying is not completely a waste of time.
A lot of majors require a certain amount of free elective credits, where you can take any classes that you may be interested in. Some students tend to forget that they have these credits until their final semester, like Marisa Kofmehl, a senior public relations major, whose two classes this semester consist of free electives. “I think at first I was mostly just focused on my major,” Kofmehl said. “You know, getting all the major requirements done before I thought of taking any other courses.”
Kofmehl will be taking a ceramics class and a sociology class this semester and she claims to be excited about both. “I chose ceramics because I really enjoyed it when I took a similar class in high school,” she said. “The reason why I chose a sociology class is because I’ve always looked at it as the study of people and I think that could really be beneficial for a career like public relations.”
Sometimes students just feel that they don’t have enough time to take classes outside their majors or that his or her major doesn’t allow them to do so. For example, Victoria Onorato, a sophomore who is planning on entering the field of communications, thinks that taking classes outside of your major can be a hit-or-miss. “For me, it was a great way to really test the waters in fields I normally wouldn’t pick,” she said. “The only downfall is the fact that even if you take a class and you were bad at it before, you might dread taking the class.”
Onorato uses the example of how when she was in high school she took a trigonometry class that led her to hating math but then she took one in college last semester with Professor Losonczy and she loved the course. “I think it’s great to take courses outside of your major to get a different perspective of life and what you really want,” Onorato said.
With everything becoming multiplatform, it’s better to be prepared and have knowledge of various fields rather than have no knowledge at all and just being prepared for one specific job. Taking classes that are not in your major requirements can help you prepare yourself for this, it makes you a well rounded person and shows that you are not only open but have incentive of learning things outside of your comfort zone.

Many full-time college students look forward to kicking back, relaxing, and ridding their minds of all things regarding school and academia in the summer. However, if this is not the lifestyle you choose, you may be able to enroll in a summer course and still have just as much time for yourself to relax as you had hoped for. If you’re thinking about taking summer courses, there are a couple of points to keep in mind.
It’s essential to know what these various summer courses can do for you personally. According to a group of collective authors, the Varsity Tutors USA Today’s article entitled, “3 Benefits of Summer College Courses,” (May. 20, 2015), summer courses can offer the same level of education as a spring or fall semester, in a condensed period of time.
One of the benefits of summer college courses is that they offer you the chance to catch up on your work or to get ahead of any coursework if you choose to do so. “Summer courses are a great idea even if you are on schedule to graduate. If you would like to work ahead or lighten your standard semester load, taking one or more summer college classes can help you do so,” according to the Varsity Tutors.
Other benefits include condensed class sizes, and fewer distractions in class, as well. According to the authors, “Summer courses are typically smaller in size than classes available during the traditional academic year. (This is due to lower summer enrollment numbers). Thus, one benefit of the summer term is its increased student-professor interaction.” In regards to fewer distractions than a regular class, the site states, “With a reduced course load, you will be able to focus more on the class or classes you’re enrolled in.”
Freshman psychology and forensic science double major, Shanice Arthur, believes summer courses are beneficial to pursue. “To me, learning in the summer is easier because I don’t have to worry about doing work for five other classes. I go, get my work done, then I still have a lot of free time to myself,” she said.
Junior broadcasting major Stephanie Mocerino agreed. “I think it’s definitely beneficial because you’re able to get ahead of things and set yourself up so that your schedule isn’t as busy in the fall. I haven’t enrolled in a summer course thus far due to traveling and working a lot over summer, but I have always wanted to and I may look into it this summer,” she said.
I believe that taking summer courses in college can only help and not harm in the long run. You’re receiving the same education but in a condensed amount of time, and for what it’s worth, I would definitely take advantage of summer courses, if it means making my workload lighter and overall, relieving substantial amounts of school-related stress.
What about you? Have you taken, or do you plan to take, a summer course? Please forward your thoughts about it to the Pioneer at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

So, here I am turning on my fourth first episode of a series on Netflix. I have been completely lost since I finished “Game of Thrones” last Friday. What do I do? The action packed, blood flowing and astute HBO series has got me hooked. But, my last words to my housemate Ian Jonson, who hadn’t ventured into the world of kings and wars, were, “Mate, don’t start it, your life will end and with no remorse.”
I have now started to watch another series, after many vigorous trials, and I guess it isn’t that bad. However it is nothing like the heroism of Jon Snow. It will have to do for the time being. This bubble I’ve been in throughout the winter break, during which I was getting annoyed at deciding what series to waste my life on, has been popped, and my brain has come alive with excitement. It has also put things back in prospective. I know what I should really be getting enthusiastic about, and I am now so happy the semester has begun.
In this brisk, bitter, and battering start to the spring semester, which I guess is no different than the torrential rainy London where I come from, my brain and my body grew warm at the thought of the class schedule I have chosen this semester.
I signed up for a Zen Buddhism philosophy class with the infamous and quick-witted professor Alexander Najman; anybody who knows me well enough understands that this type of course gets my ‘juices flowing’.
Najman’s ability to intrigue me in his Intro to Philosophy class during the fall semester made me feel the need to take another class with him, and so I did…and as he came to the end of explaining what this wonderful class entails this semester, my mind was exploding.
He explained that in the class we would be, “…ideally creating a new way to overcome and passively analyze the stresses and anxieties that plague our everyday realities.” Now if you aren’t blown away after reading that short quote from the mouth of the man himself, Professor Najman, then I better close up shop. This type of class, with someone with such great experience teaching it, can’t get any better, right? Although I haven’t really begun the full class entirely, I am already filled with content.
My favorite part of this class is the writing tasks. A task that doesn’t only apply to students in this course, but it also applies to students who like writing. Each week, we have to write as much as we can; whether it is a page, page-and-a-half, or two pages, we just have to write something. The rules are that we don’t want to think, we don’t want to really put our minds to this task, but just write, anything: how you feel, what you sense or smell, something you are looking at or have seen.
This is truly beautiful. And I also think it could be therapeutic and beneficial for any student. Any stresses that you feel at the moment, about maybe starting new classes that are going to test you, any anxiety that you are having at coming back to school and seeing people you may not necessarily want to see, or maybe if you broke up with your partner over the break—just write some things down in your notepad.
It will take things off your mind, and make you more relaxed so that you can concentrate on everything that this semester will throw at you. Perhaps practicing this writing technique on a day-to-day basis is something worth trying, and if it doesn’t work then ‘sod’ it. What have you lost?
I hope that you guys felt just as lucky as I do walking into your first classes this semester. If you haven’t, then make sure you give your classes a chance, be open-minded and try to find what the class has to offer to you, to your future. If it is one of those nothing-classes that we all have to take, for one reason or another, then get through it. But please try to find positives in whatever the subject is. Don’t fight the opportunity to learn something new and different.
For example, if you think that your English Literature class will be boring, find something intriguing about it. In my English Literature class, we read a poem called ‘An Essay of Man,’ written by Alexander Pope. I couldn’t help but get aroused at the prospect of learning such gorgeous rhythmic writing. Granted I am English and I am a sucker for philosophy and writing, but if we all go into classes that we think we are going to hate, with an eager attitude and a willingness to try and learn and feel the material we are given, then maybe we might be enlightened to so many new ideas, and we might all just be surprised at what we actually enjoy, whether it be statistics or a poem from a geezer in the 18th century.
Although I haven’t quite understood the meaning of this quote yet, and I am sure I will as the semester goes on. I am going to leave it with you and see how you interpret it:
“Empty handed I go and yet the spade is in my hands; I walk on foot, and yet on the back of an Ox I am riding; When I pass over the bridge, Lo, the water floweth not, but the bridge doth flow.”
–Alexander Pope
