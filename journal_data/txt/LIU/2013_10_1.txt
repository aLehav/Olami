Kristiane Aateigen, the Pioneer’s 2013-2014 Online Editor, is an intern at NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) in Lillehammer Norway.

“I am so glad I got involved with all the publishing platforms at school, because NRK journalists produce articles for the web, a daily news show, and they have a radio channel. And they let me try any of it whenever I want! So if I am bored at my internship, it is my own fault.”
Kristiane’s favorite topics to report on are hard / breaking news and human interest stories. Her advice to undergrads is to, “Treat school like a job. Be a credible, respectable, intellectual and honest person. And start thinking ‘now’, not ‘later’.”

Samantha Bishal, former Pioneer Editor-in-chief from 2010-11, started as an assistant editor at NBC after graduation, working primarily on the show Talk Stoop.

Everyone I worked with was “so helpful and taught me so much,” she said. “I feel truly blessed.” She was promoted to Show Editor for Talk Stoop, which airs every Saturday on NBC after SNL. Here is a link to some of the shows Bishal cut. She continues to work at NBC, now as Story Producer and Lead Editor on  George to the Rescue, airing on Saturday mornings on Channel 4. “It’s the most rewarding project I’ve ever worked on,” she said.
Bishal also said, “I know I will be running the risk of sounding simple but I love it here. I feel like all my hard work at Post has led up to this very moment and I plan on staying in this industry as long as I can.”
Her advice to undergrads is to, “Never turn down an opportunity to learn something new. That’s how I got here.”
“I still think back to the “Pioneer days” and miss it. It was and will always be an incredible experience.”

Kiara Braithwaite (’14), the 2013-2014 Design Editor of The Pioneer, is now a Graphic Designer for the Fisherman Magazine Corporation on Long Island. Kiara is in charge of producing the layout for the New Jersey Edition of The Fisherman. She is also in charge of editing online hyperlinks and uploading weekly and monthly online reports of her edition.
“After graduating, I was completely nervous about not getting a job within my field of Digital Art and Design,” Braithwaite said. “This job was sent to my email back in January from a job website and I was completely bummed that I couldn’t make an attempt to apply because they were looking for a full time employee and I had a semester left. Clearly it was not the right time, and I had to be patient to see what else might have been in store for me. Three weeks after graduation, after applying to 15 jobs in my field, I received another email from the same job website saying that The Fisherman was looking for a full time employee! I didn’t waste anytime and I immediately applied. I was hired and welcomed into this amazing company with open arms. I feel truly blessed.”
Kiara is convinced now that everything happens for a reason. She found her lucky number 16! Kiara would like to give special thanks to the LIU Post Pioneer for giving her a great resume that allowed her to land such an amazing career.

Kayla Krause, the Pioneer’s Editor-in-Chief in 2010, has been living and working in Boston since she graduated.
She is a Senior Account Executive at CHEN PR, www.chenpr.com, a public relations agency based in the city. She works on security-based technology accounts that involve dealing with data breaches, cyber security, and online hacks such as the recent Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of Personal Management (OPM), and the notable Target and Home Depot breaches. As a Senior Account Exec, she handles a variety of tasks. On a daily basis she communicates with reporters and analysts; pitches stories to publications, journalists, and industry experts; helps develop client brands and industry messages; and writes press releases, award submissions and speaking proposals. She is in constant contact with her clients whether it’s about a recent cyber hack or an upcoming press opportunity or event, the list goes on.
But Kayla hasn’t lost the knack for writing outside of the industry as well. CHEN has its own blog, www.chenpr.com/blog, which she writes for at least once a month on pretty much anything – social media, PR, sports, and what’s going on in Boston.

Mimmi Montgomery (’14), who was the Pioneer’s spring 2014 Operations Manager, and before that the Assistant News Editor and Assistant Features Editor, is a journalist from Sweden currently working in News for the Associated Press, London Bureau. She also freelances for the BBC in London. After graduating from LIU Post, she earned a masters degree focusing on human rights and politics at University College London. She was accepted to a program, via City University, that offered the opportunity to shoot two documentaries, as well as trainee placements with big media outlets. She first did ten weeks at BBC News at Six and Ten, worked hard, and was later offered freelance opportunities at the BBC.  
Mimmi obtained her first “big” internship as a reporter for The New York Observer using her Pioneer articles as writing samples. “When I got my first big internship, for The New York Observer in New York City, I applied using only clips from The Pioneer. That proves that even some of the most competitive internships put good writing skills above the outlet your work comes from. For that reason, I think all journalism majors should get involved with The Pioneer,” she said.
“If I’d give aspiring journalists some advice, I’d say: Strong writing skills matter (I think I’m a strong writer because I read a lot, and solve crosswords). Help others & network – some will remember something you did for them, and help you out at a later point. Be kind, fair, and positive! – most of my feedback letters state I’ve got ‘just the right attitude’.  Plus, of course, don’t be late.. and arrive prepared.”

Heather Norris (’12), the Pioneer’s Sports Editor from 2011-2012, lives with her fiancé in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she is the external affairs specialist for Cincinnati Metro, Cincinnati’s public transit agency. In that capacity, she writes news releases, newsletters and columns, conducts background research, updates the website and social media, and organizes and hosts community events. She also produces behind-the-scenes videos as well as interview pieces with transit riders.
Norris was previously a reporter with the Baltimore Sun Media Group, covering community news for the Cantonsville Times and Arbutus Times in Baltimore’s southwest suburbs. Before that, she worked as a local news reporter for the Baltimore Jewish Times.
Norris received her master’s degree from Syracuse University’s Newhouse School in June 2013. While she was there, she worked as an instructional associate, or a TA, for the Introduction to Multimedia Storytelling class all freshmen and new students in Newhouse are required to take. She was in charge of teaching the technical part of the class, where students learned how to shoot and edit video.
“I turned down a job offer covering high school sports in New Jersey [right after graduating from Post] in order to go to Syracuse, and I’m really happy I did. I graduated from LIU confident in myself as a sports writer, but now I am comfortable reporting on anything,” she said.

David Otero (’14), the Pioneer’s Editor-in-Chief during the 
fall 2013 semester and before that the Sports Editor from 2012-2013, is now an on-air personality at WALK 97.5 FM on Long Island.
You can hear him on your radio on weekends as David Cole. He also helps produce a psychic show on Sunday nights (9 p.m. – 12 a.m.) at WALK with Jeffrey Wands, heard across the country.
David believes that students should join the Pioneer because it’s such a friendly environment, and the experiences you can have through the paper are invaluable.
“I walked into Post as a freshman and I had a love for writing so I decided to join the Pioneer. It was one of the best decisions I made! The people I met were amazing! The experiences of covering almost all the sports teams on campus were a blast. Running meetings for the Pioneer staff as the Co-Editor-in-Chief was valuable for me and I looked forward to them each week! And I’ve made friends for life because of the Pioneer! I loved every minute of being a part of the Pioneer and I miss it very much!”
