Plans are finalizing for a student-run Art Gallery Store that will be built into the ASL Gallery in Hillwood Commons. The university- funded store will feature and sell student-made art, ranging from ceramics, paintings, t-shirts, sculptures, mugs, and everything in between. Initially slated for a Sept. 23 reception, the grand opening will be postponed several weeks due to logistical issues. The store is also waiting for a new drafting of the consignment contract given to prospective artists wishing to sell their work. Displays of student works are already situated in the gallery, with more to be added before the reception.
Special Projects Coordinator Tamir Dayya, manager of the student-run businesses on campus, is tasked to work with students and other faculty in organizing the new store. Interested students must sign a consignment contract with the university in order to have their work be sold, with prices decided by the artist.
“[Students] receive 70 percent of the sale price,” said Dayya. “The other 30 percent will go back into the student-run business program, which is then split 50/50; half going to a scholarship fund, [and] the other [half] going back into the businesses.” This is a new amendment
to the contract currently being negotiated, with advisory from art department faculty.
Dayya, the LIU Post legal faculty, and Art Foundation Director, Winn Rea, to whom the initial idea of the store belongs, wrote up the contract. Despite the large percentage of potential sales money and positives for students, according to the contract as it now stands, LIU Post is not responsible for any damaged works during their stay at the Art Gallery Store. Dayya was confident that this would not be a problem.
“Within the consignment contract I do believe that students are responsible for their work. However, we don’t by any means think that will be an issue,” explained Dayya.“That door is going to be locked when there is no attendance, and the items will not be touched other than by the student [who] is working there; [they are] trained to deal with the different pieces, [so] it is not an issue that we think will come up at all.”
Regarding the selection process of artworks, Dayya said, “It’s typically a 30-day period that a student’s artwork will be in there, unless they contact us before that time runs [out], and we can renew it. We
are not very strict on what we select, as long as it’s a custom, one-of- kind, made by that individual student. We want to give everyone a fair chance.”
The Art Gallery Store is due for an opening very soon, according to Dayya, who has been working with art student groups on campus such as the Art and Art History Club. These students are aiding in social media outreach for the launch of the store. “We want to get the artwork up, and we want to add to the diversity to the different entities that are in this [student-run business] program. I think this is going to be a great addition,” he said.
“We are planning the opening reception,” said junior Digital Arts and Design major Stacie Zucker, president of the Art and Art History Club. “There are still some things to work out. For example, I am designing the logo, and we will be installing those in the windows.” Students are also being employed to handle the artworks, and operate the cash registers.
“From what I’ve heard, in order to make it democratic, there may be a board of members who will preview the work,” said senior Art History major Joseph DeLeon, treasurer of the club. “In order to make it fair, so one person is in charge of it, there may be a board where [students] would have more of a say in the [judging process].”
“We’re trying to reach out to students, faculty, and various professionals that are coming in these doors day in and day out,” said Dayya, regarding the target market for the store. “People that are coming for events at the Tilles Center, [and] directly from off campus [are potential buyers]. We haven’t really zeroed in our target market because we want to keep it open. We are willing to offer a wide spectrum of things, and we don’t want to force things into the hands of anyone.”
It is currently in discussion if the exhibition pieces will become available for sale as a part of the store. Seasonal items may play a role in the marketing plan, as well. “Christmas time will probably be a big selling point,” said junior Arts Management major Hannah Fitch, secretary of the Art and Art History Club.
“I like the fact that students will be able to start selling their work, and see what is more or less valued in terms of sale nowadays,” said senior Fine Arts major Alexandra Pospelova. “However, I think that the location of the showcase is not the best because it will be cutting into showroom, which will [disrupt] the appearance of the exhibitions.” According to Dayya, fixtures that can be moved are going to be acquired, and the store will be able to accommodate requests for opening up floor space for exhibitions.
Suggestions for the upcoming Art Gallery Store and other student-run businesses on campus can be sent to studentrun@my.liu. edu. For additional information on how to get involved, the Art and Art History Club holds meetings every Wednesday during common hour in Hillwood Commons, room 114.

Bones protruding from the hips, sunken eyes, and sad expressions are some of the heart-wrenching things seen at horse auctions. Unwanted horses from lesson programs or those who were once privately owned stand helpless—futures unknown—in a scary environment. A good majority of these animals could have gone on to live perfectly healthy, long lives but end up at horse auctions because the owners surrender them due to financial reasons, life changes (such as moving or starting a new job), or loss of interest in the horse or riding in general. Some of these horses were once kids’ ponies, ex-show horses, school horses, or even those that pulled wagons for the Amish.
An auction is held where people can bid on a horse of their choosing after seeing it go under saddle or in hand. The two main horse auctions that take place near LIU Post are located in New Holland, Pa., and Camelot, N.J. The horses that aren’t lucky enough end up getting crammed into trailers bound for slaughterhouse plants.
However, the life of one lucky horse is about to change, as the coach and members of the LIU Post equestrian team are looking to purchase and rescue a slaughter bound mini. The team, under the guidance of Coach Jen Hennessey-Henick, has been fundraising through bake sales and contributions in order to rescue a miniature horse, which is set to go through sometime during the fall. The goal is to raise $1,500 and, so far, the team members have made almost half the amount.
The three LIU Post equestrian team captains, Cristina Bakos, a senior Speech pathology/Pre-Med major, Michelle Arenella, a senior Education major, and junior Alex Diez, came up with the plan to rescue a mini in order to raise awareness of the issue, get a cute team mascot, and—most particularly—to save a life. All of the money donated will be used to rescue the equine, and pay for its many expenses, some of which will include vet and farrier appointments, board, feed, and anything else it might need. The girls in charge of fundraising for the team are junior Education major Christina Kotarski, and junior Psychology major Christina Cepeda, but everyone on the team have decided to help out meet its goal. On Wednesday, Oct.1, a bake sale will be held during common hour in Hillwood Commons.
When asked about rescuing a slaughter bound horse, junior Christina Kotarski responded, “I am honored to be apart of such
a rewarding and inspirational fundraiser. We would be the first intercollegiate equestrian team on Long Island to save a horse from slaughter. I am so thankful for all of the generous donations and I know together we can all make a difference in one horse’s life.”
All members of the equestrian team are very involved with volunteer work, according to Colleen Dreyer, team treasurer and senior Public Relations major. “I think the equestrian team is very honorable for that,” Dreyer said.
The team is made up of riders of all levels, and practices at the on-campus facility, North Shore Equestrian Center. It is a part of the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA), an organization in the United States and Canada, which allows students to take lessons and compete against other school teams without having to own his or her own horse. On Nov. 9 at 8 a.m., the team will be hosting its own show at North Shore Equestrian Center, where teams from the region will compete. It is an exciting event to watch, consisting of “flat” classes that require the riders to walk, trot, and canter, as well as “over-fences” classes that necessitate the horse and rider to navigate a set course of jumps. LIU Post students and faculty are encouraged to come out to the stables and support their fellow classmates.
If you are interested in joining the team or just have questions, the members meet on Thursdays at the stables during common hour.
If you would like to donate to support the mini rescue, you can go to www.gofundme.com/save-a-pony or email christina.kotarski@my.liu. edu or christina.cepeda@my.liu.edu. Better yet, buy a cupcake or two on Wednesday, Oct. 1 at the bake sale!

On Wednesday, Sept. 24, the men’s soccer team (4-3-1) was handed their third loss of the young season at the hands of Molloy College Lions. The Pioneers climbed out of several holes during the match, but ultimately fell short.
The Lions got the scoring started with a quick goal in the eighth minute. Senior midfielder Hamza Elotmani scored an impressive bicycle kick, giving his squad the early lead. Later in the first half, the Pioneers tied the score at one via a goal from graduate midfielder Dale McDonald. Just before halftime, the Lions capitalized on a scoring opportunity
and jumped ahead 2-1. Meanwhile, the Pioneers had multiple scoring chances and failed to convert on three corner kicks. At halftime, the Lions led the Pioneers 2-1.
Fresh out from halftime, Elotmani and company came out firing and sent a shot passed the LIU goalkeeper extending their lead to 3-1. Looking to respond, freshman forward Jason Lampkin gave the Pioneers new life with two goals within a six-minute span. It was a new game in the 66th minute. The Lions, seemingly the underdogs now that they have given up a two goal lead, regrouped and netted a go ahead score in the 75th minute.
The Pioneers responded yet again. This time, senior forward Eivind Austboe beat the Lion goalie for his seventh goal of the season, evening the score at four apiece. A seesaw battle with multiple lead changes and ties featured one more. Senior back Joey Pinto provided the game-winning goal for the Lions on a free kick from about 25 yards out.
The Pioneers more than doubled the Lions in shots and corner kicks and had their second best game offensively with four goals, but they were obviously displeased with the result. The Pioneers looked to bounce back on Saturday, Sept. 27 when they faced the Bears from NYIT (5-1-1) in the battle of Northern Boulevard.
The Bears struck first, notching the games first goal in the third minute, putting the pressure on the Pioneers early. Looking to respond, Austboe slithered his way through the Bear defense to tally his eighth goal of the young season and tie the contest at one. The defense struggle now ensued as both teams had very little scoring opportunities, posting five and six shots on goal respectively.
Freshman Bear goalkeeper Jonathon Rico and junior Pioneer goalie Jesper Malmstrom each recorded four saves in the draw, and held the high powering offenses to no goals in the entire second half and both overtimes. The Pioneers return to action on Wednesday, Oct 1, against the University of the District of Columbia Firebirds. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m.

Coming off an impressive 2-0 victory against the Lions from Molloy College on Tuesday, Sept. 23, the LIU Post women’s soccer team took the field with a lot of confidence in their matchup against the Bears from NYIT on Saturday, Sept. 27 in Old Westbury, N.Y.
The first half saw neither team get on the score- board, but the Pioneers seemed to have the upper hand in the contest. They outshot the Bears 7-1 in the first 45 minutes and held a 4-1 advantage in corner kicks. The Pioneers were able to get on the board in the 66th min- ute, when senior back Lauren Bellone found the back of the net to one up the hosts. Less than four minutes later, Bellone was back for more as she headed a goal to double the Pioneer lead. The goals for the senior were her second and third of the season, which is third best on the squad.
Freshman forward Alex Lynn tacked on a goal in the 81st minute, beating the Bear goalkeeper and putting the icing on the cake for the Pioneers. The 3-0 win was the fourth shutout for the Pioneers of the season and their sixth straight victory. Sophomore goalie Hrafnhil- dur Agnarsdottir was once again stellar in the net, mak- ing two saves and notching her sixth win of the season.
Head coach Mark Dawson and the Pioneers return to action on Saturday, Oct. 4 against the Queens College Knights. Kickoff is slated for 4 p.m. from Brookville N.Y.

Despite the Greyhounds (1-3) leading by two scores early in the 4th, the LIU Post football team (2-2) pulled off a come-from-behind victory after trailing by 13 to defeat Northeast-10 Conference foe Assumption, 28-27, on Saturday, Sept. 27 at Multi-Sport Stadium in Massachusetts.
The Pioneers began their second possession of the contest with excellent field position at the Assumption 37-yard line. Red-shirt senior quarterback Steven Laurino executed a quick five-play drive, which was capped off by a five-yard Laurino scramble for the game’s first touchdown. LIU added to their lead the following drive, as Laurino mounted another fast-paced drive to double the Pioneer lead to 14-0. The 5th-year senior was swift on the ground and in the air, as he started off with a 12-yard dash into Greyhounds territory and then fired a 25-yard strike to red-shirt sophomore wideout Shane Hubbard on the following play, giving the Green and Gold a first-and-10 inside the red zone. A couple of plays later, Laurino scampered into the end zone from five yards out for his second rushing touchdown of the afternoon.
Assumption responded as they sliced the deficit in half, trailing 14-7 at the intermission. The Greyhounds were able to capitalize off a missed field goal try by Pioneers senior kicker Karsten Viste and score their first touchdown of the game. Greyhound junior quarterback Trevor Vasey hooked up with freshman receiver Ashton Grant to make it a one- score game.
The second half began with a boom, as the hosts evened up the score after an impressive eight-play, 71-yard drive. Vasey found the end zone on a 14-yard carry to tie the game up at 14 apiece.
LIU Post struggled to take advantage of two Assumption turnovers with one of the possessions resulting in another failed field goal attempt by Viste. The Pioneers inability to score left the door open for a Greyhounds comeback. On a third-and-10 from the 27-yard line, Vasey connected with senior wideout Eddy Frazier down the field for
a 46-yard gain to the Pioneers 27. Four plays later, Vasey and Grant hooked up again, this time resulting in a 7-yard touchdown.
As the game entered the 4th quarter, the visitors dug themselves an even deeper hole as the hosts extended their lead 27-14. Senior tailback Matt Heriveaux crossed the goal line for a 1-yard score.
The game was far from over as the Green and Gold narrowed the deficit to seven at the 9:54-mark when Laurino launched a 48-yard bomb to red-shirt senior wideout Kamron Palmer. The Boise native completed three passes of 10 yards plus in the drive, one of which was a 22-yard pass to red-shirt freshman James Higgins on a second-and-21.
Missing the extra point when the scoreboard read 27-14 proved to be costly for the Greyhounds, as the Pioneers eventually regained the lead and momentum on their next drive. Laurino paved the way for his team as he led a 64-yard passing assault, en route to the game-winning score. The series ended with a 19-yard pass from Laurino to Hubbard for his third touchdown catch of the season.
As time continued to tick down, the Pioneers defensive unit made a huge stop backed up in their own territory forcing the Greyhounds
to punt. Vasey faced the heat as Pioneer defenders brought him down
for a sack on a crucial third-and-six at the LIU 40. The ground attack proved pivotal in the late stages of the game as sophomore tailback Mike Williams rushed for two key first downs that sealed the victory for the Pioneers after starting their final possession pinned inside their own 10.
Laurino had another impressive outing, completing 27-of-40
for 329 yards and two touchdowns. In addition, he racked up 35 yards on the ground and a pair of scores. “Steven is a 5th year senior who understands this offense. He mentally prepares himself and acts as another coach on the field,” said Coach Collins. Palmer grabbed seven passes for a game-high 117 yards and a touchdown, while Hubbard reeled in eight balls for 96 yards and a touchdown. Higgins, junior tight end Sean Binckes, and red-shirt freshman wideout Kyle Ward all pitched in with multi-catch efforts.
Defensively, graduate lineman Manny Dopazo posted a game- best 10 tackles and red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti had nine stops to go along with an interception. Senior defensive lineman David Sumter (1.5 sacks) and red-shirt freshman lineman Jess Agbotse recorded six tackles apiece.
Head Coach Bryan Collins said, “We have an excellent group of young men who listen and have genuine respect for each other. Creating a great team atmosphere has helped relationships flourish and has created strong player bonds.” Collins and the Pioneers look to take two out of three on their roadtrip as they travel to Ossining, N.Y. to face-off against Pace University next Sat. Oct. 4th. Kickoff is slated for noon.

On Thursday, Sept. 25, the women’s volleyball team earned their third consecutive win, defeating fellow East Coast Conference opponent Molloy College, at the Pratt Recreation Center. The Pioneers fought hard to win their first set, but brought the fire in the end, beating their opponent in a three-set sweep.
Kicking off the first set, the Green and Gold collected 13 kills, with a total hitting percentage of .205. With the flow of adrenaline going strong for LIU Post, the Lions had difficulty in returning the favor. The Lions took one point on a service ace from sophomore setter Ally De Kruyf, before losing their offensive momentum at the end. Taking advantage of the drop, the Pioneers managed a 17-15 lead, which led them to clinch their first set win of 25-23.
During the second set, Post continued their dominance, as senior setter Lulu Centro started with six service aces and set up the game to be a runaway-one for the home team. Staying consistent with their flow, freshman middle blocker Heather Ball and graduate outside hitter Katie Hudencial, consecutively gave service aces of their own, to keep the momentum in their team’s favor. At the end of the set, the Pioneers earned the win, with a hitting percentage of .500 and a final set score of 25-10.
The final game between the Pioneers and the Lions went hand in hand, as both competitors were quick to match each other even. With six ties, and three lead changes, the Pioneers had to find a way to claim victory once again. Junior middle hitter Melissa Hansen acquired consecutive kills, which earned the home team a breakthrough; one that would decide the fate of the game later on. After a service error from the Lions, the Pioneers gained four consecutive points off the serve technique of junior libero Rachel Ringor. The Green and Gold achieved success in the third and final set, with the score of 25-18.
On Friday, Sept. 26, LIU Post moved on to face the Golden Knights of Saint Rose College, also at home. During the first set, the Pioneers held a close 10-9 lead at one point, but the Golden Knights capitalized on scoring opportunities, as they coasted to a 15-10 lead. The Golden Knights claimed a first set win, with a score of 25-21. In the second set, the Pioneers took the first two points of the game, but like the first, failed to recover after a big momentum swing by the Golden Knights. The squad from upstate New York claimed the second set with a score of 25-18. In the third and final set, tensions were high between the two sides, and the Green and Gold scored the first point of the set; one that would send them on a point-to-point exchange with the Golden Knights. However, it was not meant to be, as the Golden Knights defeated LIU in a three-set sweep, outscoring the Pioneers by three in the final set.
On Saturday, Oct. 4, head coach Shellane Ogoshi and the Lady Pioneers will try to avenge the loss, as they go on the road to face the University of New Haven. The game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.
