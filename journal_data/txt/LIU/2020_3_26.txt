Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly every professional sport has been postponed, suspended, or cancelled, including the NBA, NHL, MLB, and NCAA.
The NBA was the first to suspend their season on March 11. Originally, the league planned to hold games without fans in attendance. However, the announcement of the NBA suspending their season came after reports of a player on the Utah Jazz testing positive for COVID-19.
The NHL followed shortly after, announcing the next morning that their season would be postponed as well. The Utah Jazz had recently visited Madison Square Garden to play the New York Knicks, and Jazz players used the same facilities that teams visiting the New York Rangers at the Garden used. The risk was too high considering the virus’ easy spreadability, so the season was put on hold.
The MLB acted that day as well. They cancelled the remaining spring training games and postponed Opening Day until mid-May.
The NCAA suspension was a slow and gradual process. With the March Madness basketball tournaments approaching, the NCAA originally planned to play tournament games with just family and essential staff. Large conferences such as the SEC and Big 10 cancelled their conference tournaments, leaving the NCAA no choice but to cancel their men’s and women’s tournaments.
With the exception of the MLB All-Star break that usually happens in July, there is always at least one baseball, football, hockey, or basketball game on television. Now, no games are on the air.
“It just sucks,” Connor Lambert, a junior broadcasting major, said in response to the absence of sports on TV, “I look forward to sports all the time and now there are none on. There’s nothing to watch.”
Lambert is not alone. Others are growing restless without their favorite sports as well. However, Travis Fortounas, a senior journalism major, is an optimistic lifelong hockey fan. “I understand that this is bigger than hockey and one day the sports we all love will return,” he said. “This can’t last forever.”
Neither the NHL nor the NBA has mentioned what will happen with their playoffs for the 2019-2020 season. For now, self-quarantine is the recommended option and the professional sports leagues are trying to reinforce this so fans and athletes can enjoy their favorite sports again.

The growing fear of COVID-19 has resulted in the creation and spread of myths and misinformation on social media.
Some claim that eating Chinese food puts one at a significant risk of developing coronavirus. This stigma stems from the origin of the virus being Wuhan, China.
“Chinese people are facing stigma due to this virus from people avoiding their businesses or restaurants,” Lauren Ramirez, a junior accounting major, said. “People need to get their facts straight and not be so gullible in believing false information online. People can and should continue ordering Chinese food and whatever other foods they desire.”
Some students on campus have mixed opinions on eating from Chinese restaurants and eating out in general.
“I’m avoiding going to restaurants in general until everything clears up,” Breanna Boyce, fashion merchandising major, said. “I’ve been told not to go to Chinese restaurants now just in case workers happen to just come from China and have the virus. The worker might not know they have the virus because in some cases people show no symptoms. When it all gets contained then I will go back to eating out.”
Other students have no issue with eating from Chinese restaurants during the pandemic.
“I had Chinese food last night. I have no problem with eating out, not even a little bit,” Heath Felix,senior public relations major, said. “According to both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) you cannot contract the virus from food, there is no evidence that it is a food borne illness. People should continue to order take out and stop boycotting Chinese restaurants. We need to support service businesses which are taking a significant hit right now.”
Like Felix, some students including Isabella Ceravolo, junior psychology major, want to continue eating take out so that restaurants won’t financially suffer.
Sophomore biology major Joseph Campisi was unconcerned about changing his eating habits.
“I don’t eat Chinese anyways, but I always order takeout and I will continue ordering from these places during this period, unless we are advised otherwise.”
in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, all restaurants and bars had to move to only takeout and delivery orders in New York on March 15.
“Limiting people from eating out at restaurants where people will be in close proximity to others will prevent exposure and this is an effective measure to flatten the curve,” Felix said. “However, we must support our local businesses and order take out and delivery.”
“Individuals need to maintain social distance, keeping in six feet from other people and washing their hands,” Ramirez said. “These are crucial preventative measures that people should focus on instead of stigmatizing Chinese restaurants.”

On Instagram, there is an account that posts photographs of tiny rubber ducks hidden all around campus. When someone on campus finds one, they can post of photo of it with the hashtag #liudux, therefore participating in a “ducky scavenger hunt.” The account holder, Alina McCarthy, does not have an actual name for the activity. Students can tag @LIUdux on Instagram when they find one of the ducks.
McCarthy, a freshman vet-tech major, is the proprietor of the @LIUdux account. “I simply just wanted to add another fun memory for the students here. I thought of it about a year ago in high school,” she said.
“A bunch of people [have] placed these ducks around everywhere just for the sake of doing it. A young lady in my high school did it as an abortion protest and that truly motivated me to do this scavenger hunt,” McCarthy said. “I tend to carry around 10 ducks with me, all numbered, and place them wherever no one is looking or in obscure places.”
McCarthy numbers all of the ducks hidden around campus, and when she posts the photos people submit to the @LIUdux Instagram account, each number is displayed. McCarthy is working alone, although some people have known about it but don’t say anything, according to her. She uses about 60 ducks per scavenger hunt.
“I still have 40 to place, but that will have to wait until after the quarantine. I’m thinking about giving prizes to the people who find the ones that are hard to find in the fall,” she said.

Senior social working major Adam Silverstein is very involved on campus. He has been a Residence Assistant and Orientation Leader for three years, was elected as the 2019 Homecoming King, and is the founder and president of the Be The Change Club. However, there may be something you might not know about him.
Adam and his mom have had a tradition together on campus for the last four years.
“The tradition is that every Sunday we meet up at Hillwood Commons, get some snacks, and see the 3 p.m. movie together,” Silverstein said. “It’s been great because with our busy schedules it’s hard for us to find time to see a lot of movies in the theater so this gives us the chance to still see them.”
The Hillwood Cinema operates throughout the school year and shows movies that were recently in theatres. The cinema is located in Hillwood Commons and plays movies every Wednesday at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.
The Hillwood Cinema introduced the two to movies that they would have never normally seen. The movies allow them to discuss and talk about their opinions.
“It’s hard to pick a favorite movie we’ve seen but we love seeing scary movies, like recently we saw ‘IT: Chapter Two’ here and my mom’s favorite movie we’ve seen here is ‘A Star Is Born.’ We also love animated movies,” he said.
The tradition has been something Adam has held very close to his heart for the past four years.
“It’s important to us because ever since I started living on campus in my sophomore year it gives a chance to see each other at least once a week and we bond over the movies we see,” he said. “I also don’t know how busy I will be after graduation, so it allows me to cherish the time I have with her now.”
Adam is still currently living on campus but is unable to continue his tradition due to Hillwood Cinema being closed.
“They’re not showing movies here at Hillwood for the rest of the semester, but once I go back home then we are definitely going to continue the tradition,” he said.

Four members of the LIU Post Circle K Club took a trip to the New York District Convention (DCON) in Albany, New York from March 6-8.
The Circle K is an international organization that is the world’s largest collegiate service group. It is a subgroup of Kiwanis International, a non-profit organization which specializes in improving the lives of children.
LIU Post Circle K was established on campus last February. The club hosts bi-weekly meetings that consist of planning service projects. Circle K also hosts workshops to enhance leadership, and do fellowship activities to make friends within the club and get to know each other better.
Their in-house service projects include DIY Dog Toys to be donated, cards to first responders, and valentines to nursing homes. Their motto is “Live to Serve. Love to Serve.”
“Our club is open to everyone on campus, and we hope to make everyone feel welcome to stop by and see what Circle K is all about,” Beth Hillman, a junior nursing major and president of Circle K said.
DCON is one of three annual New York Circle K Conventions where they focus on leadership and celebrating student accomplishments. The students traveled with their advisor, Jessica Rappaport, taking the Amtrak train with the LIU Brooklyn’s chapter of Circle K.

During the weekend, the four students participated in a whole array of workshops to grow the club, while also growing as leaders and networking with their peers.
Circle K clubs from across the state came together to celebrate achievements from throughout the service year, present awards to clubs for service and involvement and attend a service fair dedicated to bringing awareness to causes.
“Throughout the weekend there are fellowship activities such as team challenges and a Lip Sync Battle to meet Circle K’ers from around the state and make new friends.” said Hillman. They also held elections for district office positions where clubs of the New York clubs could vote in elections to decide who would become the New York District leaders.
Any student is welcome to their meetings. The members recommend that people come and check it out or even do a service project with them. You can hear about future events through their instagram, liupostcki.

The NCAA announced the suspension of all remaining winter and spring sports due to the evolving public threat of the new coronavirus, or COVID-19 on March 12. The following day, the Northeast Conference (NEC) announced the cancellation of all remaining conference games and practices for the spring season.
The same day as the NEC’s announcement, the NCAA also made a statement that they will grant all spring sport athletes an extra year of eligibility.
Logistics of how this will work, including scholarship money, roster sizes, and other issues, are currently in discussion among NCAA officials.
For all spring athletes, this was an unexpected and undesirable ending to a season that had just barely begun. However, for seniors in particular, this was an abrupt ending to a senior season and for some, the ending to their collegiate athletic careers.

Kendall Purdy, a women’s lacrosse senior, is one of the seniors whose collegiate athletic career came to an end due to the impact of the coronavirus.
“It’s always hard for a senior to go through their last game and come to the realization that they will never be able to lace up their cleats again,” Purdy said. “But for us this was different. We were blind-sided to say the least, and there was nothing we could do about it.”
Jackson Svete, a baseball senior, is in a different position than Purdy, as he plans to take advantage of the NCAA granting spring athletes another year of eligibility, despite learning about the cancellation of his season being heartbreaking for Svete and his teammates.
“Through the start of the fall semester, everyone is looking forward to Opening Day. To finally get to the start of the season, play three weekends, and then have it cancelled out of nowhere was terrible,” Svete said. “We worked so hard for months to not have any of it truly pay off.”
Along with other collegiate athletes across the nation, Svete is hopeful the coronavirus pandemic subsides and allows for NCAA sports to resume play come the fall 2020 semester. “I just hope that this pandemic goes away quickly so that we are able to play summer ball and continue with baseball next school year,” he said.

With the Coronavirus continuously spreading across the globe, the United States and other countries have begun to take action to prevent further spread of the virus. Certain areas have been closed off, and people have been encouraged to remain indoors. These places include the Disney Company’s theme parks.
Both Disneyland, in Anaheim, Calif. and Disney World, in Orlando, Fla. have closed for the month of March. Some people consider it to be a prudent decision.
Lucia Terry, senior art therapy major, believes that Disney closing its parks was a good decision. “I think they are doing the right thing,” she said. “I think they of all places are so full of young, sensitive beings, and it was really resourceful of them to close.”
Terry believes that since the parks are frequented by children, closing for the time being is sensible.
“They are not as clean as adults, they don’t have the awareness to wash their hands as much, and their immune systems aren’t fully developed yet,” she said. “So they’re always touching their eyes, touching their face. They are not as protective of themselves yet.”
Other students agree that closing the parks was the right thing to do.
“While it may ruin some people’s vacations, which is sad, I think it was probably the best thing to do in light of the public health epidemic that we are facing,” Isabel Barry, senior sociology major, said. “It will impact people, but I think it’s good that they closed. When they had the measles epidemic that spread like wildfire in Disneyland, California, we don’t want that happening with the coronavirus.”
“It is a reflection of the fear that the world population is facing right now,” Barry said. “The moment everything is safe, Disney will reopen with fanfare, and it will be better than ever.”

Due to the recent outbreak and spread of COVID-19, a viral respiratory illness, the nation is being impacted in many ways. One of the most unorthodox practices Americans are engaging in during this time is panic purchasing.
Panic purchasing is defined by Oxford as the action of buying large quantities of a particular product or commodity due to sudden fears of forthcoming shortage or price increase.
As the virus spreads, shelves in stores are clearing at breakneck speed. This was an anticipated reaction from the public due to individuals’ tendencies to stock up during natural disasters such as tornadoes or hurricanes in the fear of never being able to shop for essentials again.
As some people buy products in bulk, they feel secure knowing that they have extra. However, this deprives other people of the same products. In normal circumstances, supply and demand are balanced, but when people are excessively anxious about a situation, the demand out strips the supply.
“In some aisles there’s not a single thing on the shelves. It’s like a bad science fiction movie, in a way,” said Robin Ferragamo (63), a nurse from Staten Island. “When I went food shopping, it was so silent that you could hear a pin drop.”
From non-perishable food, to hygiene and cleaning products, thousands of items are being purchased. Some states’ governments such as California have decided to take charge of sales in various stores to prevent shortages.
But not everyone is participating in sales control which creates stockpiling and or complete depletion of certain items, according to CNBC’s official website. As of right now, toilet paper is the most sought-after product. But it is uncertain why people are hoarding it.
Besides toilet paper, people are purchasing large quantities of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.
“The best ways to remain healthy during this time are practicing good hygiene, sticking to a healthy diet, disinfecting all your items before you enter your home, and social distancing,” Kristi Simonetti, a senior nursing major at Wagner College, said.

The NCAA announced all winter and spring sports will be suspended as of Thursday, March 12, and all championships are canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The very next day, the Northeast Conference (NEC) announced they would cancel all conference games, practices, and championships for the winter and spring season.
The bowling team is one of the teams affected by these cancellations. Team members started their season in October 2019 and worked for six months to qualify for the NEC championship. Over three NEC meets, the Sharks went 11-7, finishing third in the NEC standings. The NEC tournament was supposed to be held on the weekend of March 20, 21 and 22.
The NCAA granted an extra year of eligibility to all spring sport athletes, but not winter athletes since they completed all or the majority of their regular season play, but still missed out on title opportunities.
This means the collegiate athletic careers for seniors Tyler Karpinecz and Bailey Lubrano came to an end.
Lubrano bowled for the Molloy Lions for two years before transferring to Post in the fall 2018 semester. Lubrano was upset when she found out her college bowling career would be cut short right before the NEC tournament.
“It was devastating to have our season cut short without our control. My senior season, gone in the blink of an eye,” she said. “I wish I could have the time back. Bowling has been a part of my life for almost 10 years, and it was very hard to say goodbye.”
Karpinecz, team captain, bowled for the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds since her freshman year. In her final season as a Shark, she was hoping to achieve great things as a team.
“Going into my final collegiate season, I was hoping to achieve a lot. As a team, I wanted us to give it our all, win NECs and make it to NCAA championships,” she said.

Karpinecz is extremely disappointed in having her collegiate athletic career cut short.
“It’s devastating. After my last season as a Blackbird, not making it to NEC championships just pushed me to be a better player for the team,” she said. “This season, the Sharks were hungry for that NEC Title, and not having the opportunity to win hurts.”
Despite this, Karpinecz is happy with her achievements for her senior year.
“As an individual, I wanted to make my parents proud, be a leader for the team and make All NEC First Team. I accomplished these and I am so proud,” she said.
Head Coach Kayla Jones was devastated when she heard the announcement that her team would not be competing for the NEC title.
“I started reading texts, posts and emails when everything was being announced, and honestly sat in silence,” she said. “What was calming for me is connecting it to all the lessons we teach and learn through sport; control what you can control, nothing is promised or given.”
Karpinecz understands the decision made by the NCAA in granting an extra year of eligibility to spring athletes, but not winter athletes.
“I think it’s a great decision made by the NCAA. All spring athletes deserve to play their full seasons,” Karpinecz said. “For bowling, we made it through a majority of our tournaments. I am grateful for the time that I had on the lanes as a Shark.”
Coach Jones understood how hard it would be to address her team about the situation, but she is optimistic for what the future holds.
“It wasn’t easy to just give that kind of information to a group of young ladies that worked hard to get there, and we’re so excited to compete together,” Jones said. “We didn’t just wake up ready and excited for championships. We worked hard together and individually to earn it and be ready to compete. Next year’s mindset will be the same.”

The 28th Long Island Guitar Festival was set to take place from March 31 to April 5 on campus. Due to spreading of the coronavirus, the event is now canceled since campus has been closed. All performances, recitals, and festivals have been canceled. This change is negatively affecting the entire department of music.
Harris Becker is the director of guitar studies who organizes the festival. He is involved in the festival in some way every year, and this year he planned to host a workshop on “Exploring the Score – Techniques for Practice.”
“This was supposed to be an international guitar festival that brought the greatest guitarists together. This year, we were going to have David Russel, the most prominent guitarist in the world these days,” Becker said. “He was finally able to come after years of trying to have him attend. He would have been there and since it is canceled, he plans on coming next year to celebrate the 28th Long Island Guitar Festival.”
The Long Island Guitar Festival is a series of concerts, master classes, workshops and high school guitars ensembles. An orchestra consisting of high school students and community members was set to play at the end of the festival alongside Post students.
In addition to these events, there is an annual high school guitar competition. “This would have been the 7th competition. The winner gets to play a concert on the next festival, so this year was going to be last year’s winner,” Becker said.
As of March 21, 2020, scheduled performers included Grammy Award winner, David Russell, Beijing Guitar Duo, Jérémy Jouve, Yenne Lee, Evan Taucher, and the Olson/De Cari Duo. In addition, Damon Smallman and Ingrid Riollot were to present a lecture and demonstration about “The History and Design of Smallman Guitars,” and Taucher was to lecture on “Creating and Building an Online Presence: Leveraging Social Media.
James Erickson, instructor of music and assistant director of The Long Island Guitar Festival, took time to grapple with the event’s sudden cancellation.
“We had to reach out to all these amazing guitarists that we worked so hard to book and tell them it’s canceled. Months of planning and work ended so abruptly,” he said. “We are trying to secure many of the same performers for next year. We might have to wait, but eventually we will hear all this great music.”
Erickson felt sympathy for the high school students who will not be able to participate in the festival orchestra competition.
“We are always impressed with the level of playing we see from these aspiring guitarists. We definitely made the right call by canceling, but it’s a little surreal that, for the first time in 27 years, there will be no Long Island Guitar Festival,” he said.
Several others were disappointed at the event’s cancellation, but understood the interest of maintaining public health and safety on campus, according to Erickson.
The festival has a reputation of reaching out to the artistic community, and for 2021, the tradition of “excellence in guitar performance and education” will continue. “We have several high school groups that attend. We have students that travel from Kernersville, North Carolina and attend every year. Other students come from Staten Island and Brentwood, NY. We will be back in 2021, better than ever,” Erickson said.

A mass email was sent out by Executive Dean of Students Michael Berthel on Feb. 29 alerting some fashion merchandising students that their spring break trip to London, scheduled for March 6 to 14, was canceled due to the widespread outbreak of the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
The London trip was a fashion consulting project, according to Alexandria Price, a sophomore business major.
“I’m happy it got canceled as I didn’t want to catch the virus and get quarantined,” she said. “The school took way too long to make a decision. Instead of going on the trip, I went home to spend time with my family and to relax.”
The trip wasn’t canceled until the students brought up their concerns about traveling amid the ongoing chaos caused by COVID-19, which at the time, was already considered to be an epidemic, according to junior fashion merchandising major, Breanna Boyce.
“We started this discussion with our professor and she brought it to the attention of LIU global, which ultimately led to the trip being cancelled,” she said.
Boyce was upset at first, but said she realized it was for the better.
“We got the trip credited back to our tuition but would rather had it refunded back onto the credit card,” she said.
Alyssa Fiscella, sophomore business major, agreed that cancelling the trip was to ensure student safety and the best possible decision considering the circumstances. She said after Berthel’s email was sent, her professor sent all fashion merchandising students scheduled to go to London a more personalized email.
“I’m fine with how the school notified us; however, I found it absurd that the issue was addressed [by the school] only until after us students had raised a concern,” she said.
Berthel’s email was somewhat vague, acknowledging specifically that the abroad program in Florence, Italy was postponed, along with “several scheduled study abroad trips.” The notice went on to say that the school recommends those within the LIU community who are planning to travel to an international destination should carefully consider potential associated risks trying to reenter the country.
Europe already had confirmed coronavirus cases when the trip to London was canceled. Angela Barone, a junior marketing major who was also supposed to attend the fashion merchandising trip, said she believed the trip was called off rather than postponed because of uncertainty as to how long it would take for the virus to subside.

After someone with an office in the Life Sciences/Pell Hall building tested positive for the new coronavirus (COVID-19), Chief Administrative Officer Joseph Schaefer sent out an email on March 12 notifying the campus community that the university was moving all face-to-face classes to an online platform called Zoom.
Zoom is a web-based video conferencing tool with a local, desktop client and mobile app that allows users to meet online with or without video or audio. The cloud-based platform calls themselves “the leader in modern enterprise video communications” that’s easy and reliable for collaboration, chat and webinars.
Schaefer’s notice followed two emails sent on March 11, one from university President Dr. Kimberly Cline, and another from Executive Dean of Students Michael Berthel, alerting students and faculty that classes would be moved online for two weeks only. Schaefer’s email explained that the person in Pell Hall who contracted the virus was also in Kahn Hall before noticing symptoms.
“To ensure all students have time to prepare during this week of spring break, the university has decided that all online instruction will now extend until the end of the spring semester,“ Schaefer wrote in the email.
Given the current circumstances, Zoom offers a way to complete classes digitally, but its convenience is defined by the major of the student using the program.
Sara Wally, a freshman musical theatre major, was nervous about her new reality in a virtual classroom.
“It’s really hard to have online classes when all of your family members are also stuck at home because their schools have canceled, and my parents are working from home, especially as a performance based major,” Wally said. “It’s been really challenging to find areas in my house that are big and quiet enough for me to dance, sing and act.”
Steele Whitney, a sophmore acting major, expressed how Zoom is practically impossible to use for classes within his major; however, his two lecture classes work very well online.
“I think Zoom is better than nothing, but I am not getting nearly as much out of it as I would in person,” Whitney said.
The biggest difference for some, like Elissa Rose, a sophmore international relations major who doesn’t mind taking her classes online, is the environment that she is learning in.
“I try my best to pay attention to the professors and their materials, but it makes me feel less motivated since I can do class in bed and have no discipline to keep me from my distractions…being on my phone, TV, eating,” Rose said.
Some students have concerns about how complicated going digital can be, and Rose is one of them. She said sometimes her WiFi cuts out or the sound and video don’t always work. The program also has a tendency to lag and have delays, according to Whitney, which becomes a disadvantage for certain majors.
But within the chaos, Rose and Whitney discovered ways to make learning online fun.
“The coolest part about Zoom is the backgrounds,” Whitney said.
There is a feature within the program that allows any user to change the background like a green screen. There is also a feature where students can use emojis to react to things said by others in the class.
“It’s fun when you can use the reactions to give a thumbs up or raise your hand without interrupting,” Rose said.
During a video chat, students can see other students, their professors and their professors’ computer screens for the purpose of power points and videos. Teachers can even split classes into “breakout groups” where students can have discussions about different topics in groups within their class.
All classes are automatically enabled to record to the cloud so teachers and the university can view them after a session is done. The recorded files can be downloaded to a computer or streamed from a browser which is a helpful feature for students who miss a class.

For the first time in 17 years, Broadway closed its curtains and went dark on March 12. The last time was in 2003 due to the musicians of several Broadway musicals going on strike. The governor of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo, put restrictions on gatherings of over 500 people to help prevent the new virus, COVID-19, from spreading among people.
Tickets bought through Telecharge and Ticketmaster will automatically be refunded. However, there is not yet any word on whether people who purchased their tickets through a third-party website will be refunded.
Olivia Gonzalez, a freshman acting major, attended a Broadway show less than a week before the governor put a restriction on mass gatherings.
“I feel very lucky that I was able to see the revival of ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’ because I had been wanting to see it since it was announced last year. It was a great show and I’m sad it never got to open,” she said. “Ultimately, I believe closing Broadway was the right decision for public health, but my heart goes out to the casts and crews of all the shows that saw their runs cut short.”
Days later, March 15, a part-time usher who works at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre (“Six The Musical”) and Booth Theatre (“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”) tested positive for COVID-19.
“I wasn’t worried because the usher was not working the day I attended, but I was glad to have the information so I could avoid exposing others,” Gonzalez said. She has been on self-quarantine since Wednesday, March 18 and has not noticed any symptoms of the coronavirus.
“I’m glad the theatre made the information public so audience members could take appropriate measures to keep themselves and others healthy,” she said.
Some Broadway stars have turned to social media. Tony Award winner, Laura Bentanti, tweeted “Dark times for all. Trying to find some bright spots. If you were meant to perform in your high school musical and it was cancelled please post yourself singing and tag me. I want to be your audience,” on March 13. As a result, Bentanti watched dozens of videos of high school students performing, as did other Broadway stars including Lin Manuel Miranda, creator and star of “Hamilton.”
“I’m definitely a fan of Broadway stars using social media to reach out to the fans. It’s important that the theatre community sticks together during a time like this. It’s a hard time to be an artist, the least we can do is support each other,” Jordan Horne, sophomore musical theatre major, said.
As of March 22, all Broadway theatres will reopen on April 12. Students can visit playbill.com for more Broadway updates regarding COVID-19.

Due to the spread of COVID-19, the class of 2020’s commencement ceremony will be held virtually on Wednesday, May 20.
Students received an email from University President Dr. Kimberly Cline on March 23 informing them that the university decided on how to proceed with commencement.
“This difficult decision was made after much deliberation and in response to the recommendations and mandates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health and government agencies,” the email stated.
Graduating students and their families will meet online a week and a half later than its originally scheduled date of May 8, to celebrate the work they put into getting their degree, rather than having a traditional ceremony on campus.
The decision was made with the safety of everyone who would be in attendance in mind and to ensure that the class of 2020 would be able to celebrate it’s accomplishments, according to Dr. Randy Burd, senior vice president of academic affairs.
“In an effort to protect the health and safety of our students, their families, alumni, and our employees, we moved this year’s Commencement, held to honor the Class of 2020, to a virtual ceremony to be held on Wednesday, May 20th,” Burd said. “ Like many other Universities around the country, this difficult decision was made in response to the recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), health and government agencies and the mandates of the New York ‘stay at home’ order.”
The uncertainty of how long the pandemic will last for was also a deciding factor in the decision.
“Since we do not know either how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last or the order will stay in force, the University wanted to ensure our graduates were recognized for their accomplishments at the end of this semester,” Burd said. “The University knows how important graduation is to our students, so we are also planning a special in-person celebration for 2020 graduates during Homecoming Weekend, to be held Friday, October 16th through Sunday, October 18th.”
Students were quick to voice their displeasure in the announcement. A petition to host a commencement ceremony, started by senior health information management major Adam Pilzer, had 10 signatures before the announcement was made. After students received the email, that number skyrocketed to over one thousand throughout the course of one day.
Pilzer said that graduating seniors aren’t the only ones signing the petition, and that he saw a lot of signatures from parents, alumni and underclassmen as well.
Some students felt that the decision to cancel the in-person commencement ceremony was made too quickly.
“I was shocked they just went straight to virtual right away,” Griffin Ward, senior broadcasting major, said. “I thought they would at least push it back a little bit, or try to do something over the summer when all this calms down.”
A virtual ceremony isn’t the same as walking at graduation, according to Sarina Carbone, a senior early childhood education major. “The class of 2020 has worked hard to get to this point and it just seems unfair that they made a decision so early on instead of waiting until early May to figure out what should be done,” she said.
For some students, the idea of a virtual commencement is hard to take seriously.
“A virtual graduation is nonsensical. I’ve seen memes about having graduation over zoom and never thought it would become a reality,” Heather Felix, senior public relations major, said. “When I told my friends and family, they actually thought I was joking. Not a smart move for a university who tries so desperately to be taken seriously.”
Some students feel that a virtual ceremony is undermining their achievement.
“In my opinion, making the commencement ceremony virtual just takes away from the magnitude of the accomplishment that graduating college is,” Carbone said.
Felix was also disappointed and agreed with Carbone that the school was selling them short. “It’s disrespectful for a university to charge its students hundreds of thousands of dollars for a college education and think an online shoutout is satisfactory,” she said.
In addition to the virtual ceremony, the university is hosting a celebration event on campus for the class of 2020 from Friday, Oct. 16 through Sunday, Oct. 18 to coincide with homecoming weekend. This idea did not sit well with students who wish to receive the recognition they feel they deserve.
“I don’t think that hosting some sort of event during next year’s homecoming gives us the notoriety that we deserve for our achievement,” Carbone said. “Many people who are graduating aren’t even from around here and won’t be here or want to come back in October for some event during homecoming. All I can say is that there is nothing that they can do that is as special as commencement.”
An event put in place to celebrate the school’s graduating class is something too special to be overshadowed by other big events like homecoming weekend, according to Ashley Herkommer, senior digital art and design major.
“We deserve a day, one hundred percent, about us and our achievements, and we also deserve to not have to share it with anyone else,” she said.
Students aren’t the only ones unhappy with the decision. Family members of graduating students can no longer watch their loved one receive their diploma.
“When I told my mom I wasn’t having a real graduation she cried,” Felix said. “Of course it upsets us as seniors who worked hard to achieve the degree, but it’s especially difficult for our families who have raised and supported us through school. It is just as much their day as it is ours. My mom feels robbed of this experience and that’s what breaks my heart.”
Ward is in a similar situation as Felix. “I had family coming down from all over the country just to see me graduate and it’s kind of a moot point now,” he said.
Several students described feeling as though a major life event was stolen from them.
“We kinda feel robbed. With everything going on, I understand why they would not wanna do it, but it’s kinda depressing because we’ve had a lot taken away from us very suddenly,” Ward said. “We go on Spring Break and they cancel school, so we don’t have a chance to say goodbye to our peers, it’s kind of like a lack of closure for us.”
Throughout college, some students can’t help but imagine themselves finally walking across the stage while simultaneously hearing their name called as an official college graduate, according to Carbone.
“It feels like that moment has been stolen from me and everyone else,” Carbone said. “We won’t even get a cap and gown or anything. It just feels very odd. I don’t even understand what a virtual ceremony will be like. How is it possibly going to be as special? I wish they would give this more thought.”
Herkommer is heartbroken over the situation, and expressed that her motivation to graduate was depleted.
“Everything I worked for I feel like was a waste of time,” Herkommer said. “It’s almost insulting for us that this is all we get after all the time and money we gave Post. They could have definitely given us options or even asked our opinions first. This is an event that people wait their whole lives for and remember for the rest of their lives and we don’t get this.”
Cline said she is proud of how the student body has reacted, despite being put in a difficult situation.
“We are proud of the resiliency, compassion and understanding our students have shown while navigating these challenging and uncertain times. We understand that this decision impacts our graduates, as well as their families, who have supported them along their journey,” Cline said. “Graduation is a milestone and is arguably our students’ greatest achievement at this point in their lives. We are dedicated to making the virtual Commencement ceremony meaningful and memorable. And, we look forward to welcoming our 2020 graduates and their families to the special in-person celebration during Homecoming Weekend.”
This story is ongoing as we await more information about graduation and the event planned for next semester.

I am the proud parent of Heather Felix, Senior at LIU Post. When we received the notification about a virtual graduation I cried. My heart breaks for all the Class of 2020 graduates who deserve a REAL graduation ceremony. LIU Post should postpone the graduation ceremony. They should think of all the students who worked hard for Four Years, dreaming of celebrating their accomplishments with their peers and professors. Praying the administrators reconsider their decision and do what is right, reschedule the ceremony.

The Situation
Since The Pioneer last reported on COVID-19 on Feb.26, the new coronavirus became a pandemic, placing life on pause, and significantly impacting the daily routine of college students and faculty all over the country.
COVID-19, better known as the new coronavirus, is described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This large family of viruses tend to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.
The most common symptoms of the virus, which are fever, tiredness and dry cough, haven’t changed since the virus began to spread, according to WHO; however, symptoms such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea were recently added to the list.
Several ear, nose and throat doctors from various locations around the globe, warn they may have discovered a new hidden symptom called anosmia—the loss of sense of smell and taste–even in those who may be asymptomatic, according to reports by Forbes, The Washington Post and The New York Times.
The disease doesn’t discriminate, affecting every race, gender, age and occupation, according to Brianna Lobianco, a senior health sciences major who works at a health clinic.
“Most cases of COVID-19 show symptoms no different than the flu,” she said. “This pandemic is affecting everyone.” 
The virus was first reported in Wuhan, China in Dec. 2019. As of March 25, there are 438,749 plus confirmed cases worldwide with 19,675 deaths. In the United States, there are 53,442 plus confirmed cases with 712 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
In New York state, there are 30,811 active cases with 285 deaths, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. And thus far, Nassau County has reported over 3,285 cases, and Suffolk County has reported 2,260 cases. When The Pioneer first reported on the virus on Feb. 26, Nassau County had just 10 cases.
Currently, Brookville has a total of six confirmed cases, according to the Nassau County Department of Health. The university reported one positive case on campus—a faculty member who reported being in both Pell Hall and Kahn before getting tested. Both buildings are temporarily closed and are scheduled to be disinfected in accordance with guidelines set forth by authorities.
“I don’t think anyone could have predicted the situation we are in right now, however, it’s good that they’re taking every precaution they can do to keep people safe,” Margaret Levin, junior musical theatre major, said.
All residence buildings remain open to accommodate those who live on campus and chose not to return home. Like many other schools and universities, LIU determined that moving classes online was a step necessary to keep students safe and healthy.
“Since it’s been confirmed that a member of the LIU community has tested positive for the coronavirus, I don’t think it would be safe for students to have to go to class right now,” Angela Barone, junior marketing major, said.
“The outbreak has actually affected a lot of aspects of my life,” Barone said.
Not only was her spring break plans canceled, but her daily life changed as well. Due to the confirmed case on campus, she said people are hesitant to go out.
“I’ve been spending a lot of time at home,” she said.
Although the new coronavirus is a global issue, for many students, the situation is anecdotal, especially in New York where there are almost 30 times more cases than any other state.
As the number of cases continue to rise, primary protective equipment for healthcare workers is quickly diminishing. Gov. Cuomo expressed his frustration with the Federal government’s lack of response to the state’s growing need for ventilators and hospital beds.
“I will turn this state upside down to get what we need,” Gov. Cuomo said during a press conference on March 24.
New York hospitals must increase capacity by 50 to 100 percent, as it is presumed that up to 140,000 hospital beds will be needed.
“The cases in New York aren’t higher because we’re New Yorkers,” Cuomo said, “I’m asking you to help New York so you can help yourselves.”
The Struggle
Changes such as taking courses online, while also adjusting to a social-distancing lifestyle, make both Levin and Barone concerned. Virtually communicating with classmates and professors is a difficult task when a student is accustomed to learning a certain way.
“I also take an advanced taxation course which is pretty challenging already, so I’m nervous it’s going to be even tougher if I have to read the material on my own without a lecture from my professor,” Barone said.
LoBianco, who in addition to attending school also works in healthcare, said she’s afraid of how online classes will affect her ability to grasp the material.
“I learn best with demonstrations and being hands on, but I understand that this is what’s best for my safety right now,” she said. “I am a science major and most of my courses have lab portions along with their lectures. I’m not sure how I will be able to do experiments online.”
In cancelling face-to-face classes, many out-of-state students went home, including Levin who’s homebound for now but left many of her belongings in New York.
“I’m currently living out of the suitcase I brought home for spring break,” Levin said.
Sara Wally, freshman musical theatre major, also decided to go home. “Being from out of state made the entire situation of moving out and grabbing my stuff 100 percent more stressful because there was a possibility that at any given moment domestic travel could come to a halt and borders would be shut down.”
The university requested that many students who study abroad also return home, while also cancelling many planned study abroad trips.
Barone was supposed to attend the fashion merchandising trip to London before it was canceled. She said the school made the right choice in cancelling the trip because conditions continue to worsen by the day.
“Confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK are getting up, and travel restrictions are getting stricter, so who knows if we would have been able to get home safely,” she said.
In a public address delivered from the Oval Office on March 11, President Donald Trump announced a 30-day ban on anyone traveling from a list of 26 European countries, excluding the United Kingdom and Ireland, who were added to the list just days later. U.S. citizens are allowed to come home but only into 13 designated airports with advanced screening efforts. The European Union announced on March 17 that they are also restricting nonessential travel into Europe for 30 days.
Jacqueline Duncan, junior business administration major, was in Australia with the LIU Global Australia program when COVID-19 began to spread. The outbreak first affected her when their trip to Bali to collaborate with students at the Balinese Institute was canceled.
While overseas, Duncan also noticed that remote indigenous communities started to fear outsiders coming into their area. In reaction to the virus, Australia began to cancel flights.
“While our surrounding area was significantly less exposed to the virus than many of our hometowns, it became clear that if we didn’t leave now while we could, we would have a very difficult time leaving once the semester ended,” Duncan said.
The Australia program was one of the last to be advised to return home because of the minimal impact in North South Wales. Students were given the choice to take classes online once they came home.
Duncan had minimal trouble flying back, but reported other students experienced trouble.
“Students who had layovers in New Zealand lost their flights once New Zealand closed its borders to all foreign flights,” she said. “This cost them extra travel expenses and stress as they scrambled to find new flights in such short notice.”
The Uncertainty
Some students were amidst thesis projects and internships when the new coronavirus suddenly placed everything on hold.
Cuomo announced on March 21 that 100 percent of New York’s nonessential workforce must stay or work from home. States like California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington have all taken similar precautionary measures, including closing all bars, schools, restaurants, gyms, casinos and movie theaters after 8 p.m.
Robyn Beeber, a senior childhood special education major, was in the middle of student teaching before the state ordered everyone to social-distance themselves until further notice.
“Now I have no idea what happens next, whether schools will reopen soon enough, if I will have to stay after graduation, or if I will have to complete student teaching next semester,” she said. “I have also lost my job as a waitress, as all restaurants are forced to do pick up or deliveries only. I had to file for unemployment to keep some sort of income to support myself for necessities like food.”
Social-distancing is defined as intentionally creating space between you and others in order to avoid catching a virus or disease. Examples of social-distancing are working from home, visiting loved ones virtually instead of in person, and avoiding large groups of people and gatherings.
Anxiety has become a common feeling shared by students as they adjust to their new way of life. LoBianco said the outbreak affected her personally as well by creating unneeded stress. She works in healthcare and risks being exposed to the virus each time she goes to work.
“I deal with patients hands-on who may have been exposed or have concerns for it,” she said. “Then I go home to my family at the end of the day and they get worried and are concerned for my health and safety, as well as their own,” she said. “
LoBianco, who is a senior expected to graduate this spring, is disappointed her senior year of college ended abruptly.
“I’m not sure what the plans are for graduation which breaks my heart. My last semester of undergrad has completely changed,” she said.
Seniors were met with the unexpected situation of saying goodbye to college and high school months before expected. Even some freshmen were met with unfortunate circumstances as their first year on campus was cut short.
“What sucks the most is the fact that I won’t get to have my freshman year showcase for Post Theatre Company, which is something that I’ve been looking forward to all year,” Wally said.
As students learn to accept their new lifestyle a midst all the chaos, they’re also trying to remember to keep a six-foot distance between themselves and others, avoid touching their faces and to cover their mouths when they cough.
“Hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds is everything right now. Stay inside if you are feeling under the weather,” LoBianco said. She also added some advice for those who may feel ill. “Reach out to your primary care physicians, or feel free to call your local urgent care clinic. You don’t need to stock up on toilet paper.”

As students transition to online classes due to COVID-19, the university is issuing conflicting statements regarding potential refunds to residents, parents and residence-life faculty who are no longer using the facilities.
After LIU announced that classes will be administered online for the rest of the spring semester to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the majority of resident students did not return to live on campus.
“My mom called the school and was told by a representative that LIU would not refund students because we are still allowed to take advantage of the facilities,” BrayLynn Willis, a freshman musical theatre major, said.
After a staff meeting, however, resident advisors told students that administration was still discussing reimbursements and that an email would be sent to students with information about housing, meal plans and dining dollars.
 
Resident students who attend Adelphi University in Garden City received an email from administration officials on March 16, six days after they asked students to return home, acknowledging that refunds would be issued. Those granted an exception were permitted to stay.
“Partial residence refunds will be calculated and prorated as of Monday, March 23. We appreciate your patience during this process,” the email stated.
Since Post hasn’t officially announced what it plans to do, moderators of the Instagram account @barstoolpost created a petition on Change.org demanding refunds for the costs of dorms.
970 people have signed the petition electronically as of Monday, March 23. Information about the petition states that students and parents have “all complained individually” but together they “can push the administration to do what’s right.”
Kamerann Burney, a freshman musical theatre major, said she isn’t too concerned about the university’s stance on the situation.
“It’s only been a week since school moved online and since the situation is rapidly changing, I understand that faculty has more immediate concerns,” Burney said. “Personally, I am no longer on campus and will be moving out of my dorm by the end of the semester, so I would eventually like a ruling on whether or not I will get my money back.”
Funds paid for room and board should be refunded, according to Burney, because currently, she’s not using either of them and doesn’t believe she should have to pay for what she isn’t using.
“Essentially, I’ve become a commuter student without a meal plan and I think I should pay the same,” she said.
Russ Drowne, a freshman gaming design major, is concerned for students who have taken out personal loans to afford LIU’s dorms.
“It feels like all that money isn’t going anywhere except to Zoom university,” Drowne said. “I personally do not want to have to pay or have extra student debt because of this. If all of my stuff is moved out [of the dorm] and I’m not utilizing any of the campus facilities, whether that be my dorm or Winnick, why should I have to pay as if I am?”
While students not living on campus desire refunds, those that stay are trying to get what they paid for.
“The vast majority of residents have left early and the ones that are staying behind are there because the school will not return the money we paid for room and board,” Brenden Rosario, a freshman business administration major, said.
Room and board is incredibly expensive, according to Willis, who doesn’t feel comfortable throwing that kind of money away.
“I don’t want to live on campus just because I paid for it,” she said. “There are few people there anymore and it’s just not the same.”
The Pioneer reached out to the Promise Office and administrative officials, but no response was received. As of March 29, students are still waiting for clarification.
