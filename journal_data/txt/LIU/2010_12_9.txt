After losing two of their first three games of the season, the Pioneers  men’s basketball team has rebounded and is now even with a 3-3 record.
During the home opener on November 30th, the Pioneers won a close  encounter with Bloomfield College 89-84. Jonathan Kohler, a guard in his  second season, recorded his first double-double of the year scoring 19  points and snatching 20 rebounds, including nine offensive rebounds.  Senior forward Aaron Hall also had a solid all-around game scoring 19  points, hauling in four rebounds, and securing three steals.
A back-and-forth match between both sides as each traded buckets for a  good portion of the game. With just over three minutes left in  regulation, the game tied at 77, a combination of free-throws between  Hall, sophomore guard Tobin Carberry, and junior guard Billy Butler gave  Post a lead that they would never let go. After a resounding slam-dunk  by freshman forward Vaughn Allen with less than a minute to play,  Bloomfield still stayed alive by nailing a three-pointer.
Later after numerous missed free-throws by the Pioneers, Bloomfield  still had two opportunities to tie the game with three-pointers, but  failed both times. With one second remaining, junior guard Stefan  Bonneau put the finishing touches on a Pioneers victory by nailing two  free-throws, making up for the poor 65 % team free-throw shooting.
The next day, C.W. Post was pitted against their first East Coast  Conference rival, Mercy College. The Pioneers shot the lights out versus  the Mavericks shooting 58% from the field, a season high. The Pioneers  had four starters reach double figures in points, and had great  production from role players getting 29 points off the bench. Kohler led  the way for Post with 21 points, and guard Gilbert Montalvo set the  tone for the offense scoring 14 points and dishing out four assists.  Montalvo also played fantastic on the defensive side of the ball forcing  four steals and bringing down six rebounds.
The Pioneers were completely in control of the game as their biggest  lead was by 30 points. C.W. Post put on a shooting clinic from just  about everywhere on the floor, shooting 38% from three-point range and  made 24-31 from the charity stripe. The Pioneers breezed past winless  Mercy 104-80.
But in their most recent contest, the Pioneers fell to Dowling College  86-73 in a sloppy game filled with turnovers by Post. Bonneau led the  way for Post scoring 23 points, 18 of them coming in the second half of  play. Hall had yet another great game scoring 18 points on 7-13  shooting, and led the team in rebounds totaling nine. But overall,  turnovers proved too costly to overcome as Post could never quite get  close to Dowling.
The Pioneers next game is at home on Wednesday December 8th at 7 p.m.  against conference rival New York Institute of Technology (2-2) where  both squads look to push their records over the .500 mark.

After fending off Mercy College’s second-half surge Wednesday December 1st, the C.W. Post women’s basketball team caved against Dowling in the same situation this past Saturday. The two-game split levels the team record to 3-3 and 1-1 in the East Coast Conference.
Senior guard Janea Aiken led the team 26 points in the win against Mercy. Forward Alyssa Lombardi had a team-high 10 rebounds, Aiken and sophomore guard Ashley Caggiano each had three assists. Mercy got to within two with roughly 20 seconds on the clock when Maverick’s junior guard Simone Williams scored a layup. However, Mercy could not reclaim possession. Instead, junior guard Felicia Joyner closed out the game and converted 1 of 2 free throws with one second left on the clock.
Up by 17 points early in the second half against the Dowling, the Pioneers were a victim of the Golden Lion offensives explosion, landing on the wrong end of a 25-4 scoring run. The Pioneers had a 42-25 as the third quarter started but not after the run from Dowling were down by five. C.W. Post fought back to tie the game on two occasions but could not gain momentum as the Golden Lions put away the game with a final score of 65-57. Janea Aiken led the team again in points with 23. Nicolette Marciniak and Felicia Joyner tied for a team high with 7 rebounds each.
Despite the loss to Dowling, the lady Pioneers have a few more games before heading into break and will look to bounce back first against New York Institute of Technology on Wednesday, December 8th, at 5:00 pm.

For many students, Intramural sports are a great way to get out of their dorm room and get active during these cold winter months.  Every week the Pratt Recreation center hosts a different intramural event and students of every range of athletic ability are encouraged to participate.
According to sophomore Intramural supervisor Ryan Tabibi, participation usually dwindles in the winter months.  “People just get lazy in the winter,” he said.
Intramurals, however, run all throughout the year.  Some of the biggest events are the Wii competitions like Wii bowling and the Wii homerun derby.  Another, more traditional event is the flag football championship, which is held every fall.  There are also tournaments offered throughout the year in sports like Tennis, Racquetball, Ping Pong, Soccer, Volleyball, Basketball, and Softball.
Although an estimated 1,000 students participate in Intramurals every year, the Pratt center and Intramural staff would love to see more participation these coming months.  “It’s a way to be active instead of being lazy all day,” said Tabibi.  Not to mention it’s fun!”
The next Intramural offered, dodge ball, begins this Wednesday.  Students are permitted to sign up either in teams or as individuals and spots are still open.  For further information, contact the front desk at the Pratt Center at 516-299-2350 or search “intramurals” on the C.W. Post website.

MLB
The New York Yankees reached deals with both Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. Jeter signed a three-year contract worth $51 million with an $8 million player option for a fourth year. Rivera signed a two-year deal worth $30 million. The Yankees now look to bring in free agent pitcher Cliff Lee as the Winter Meetings have already begun.
The Mets continue to look for bargain deals. They have yet to name a hitting coach after naming Terry Collins manager three weeks ago. There has been interest in Beltran but it is unknown how willing the Mets are willing to trade him.
The Boston Red Sox landed the first blockbuster trade of the off-season acquiring first basemen slugger Adrian Gonzalez from the San Diego Padres for four prospects. Both sides were unable to agree to an extension, however still approved the trade.
Carl Crawford can expect a big deal after the Washington Nationals blew the world away when they inked outfielder Jayson Werth to a seven-year contract worth up to $126 million.
NFL
Brandon Jacobs ran all over the Washington Redskins Sunday compiling 103 yards on eight carries scoring two touchdowns. Ahamad Bradshaw also had a good game adding 97 yards on 25 carries as the New York Giants trounced the Washington Redskins 31-7.
Too cold for comfort as the New York Jets are routed 45-3 on Monday Night Football against division rival New England Patriots. Tom Brady threw four touchdown passes to four different receivers while BenJarvus Green-Ellis ran in two touchdowns totaling 72 yards on 18 carries.

Congratulations to those who followed along with the Pioneer’s nutritional guide to a healthier and happier lifestyle –you did it! After three long months, we’ve together learned how to eat, live and think healthier. However, with the long winter break ahead of us, it is now your time to take all that you’ve been taught, and bring it home for the holidays.
You’ve learned what to eat and what not to eat, how to avoid temptations, what to eat for energy, how to become motivated to workout, how to avoid stress, and even how to work off those weekend indulgences at Campus pizza. You’ve all come a long way, and now isn’t the time to forgo all the hard work you’ve accomplished. As much as we would love to, the Pioneer will not be delivered to your doorsteps this winter break, so it is up to you to research, learn, and put energy into trying new nutritional information to get you through the holidays.
We’ve given you the ground rules to establish a better life, now challenge yourselves and continue to bring your health to new and better heights.
But before you go, the Pioneer requests you all to follow these 10 healthy commandments this holiday break:
Above all, relax. Take this time off to snuggle up, sleep in late, and just breathe.
Eat well. Don’t worry about calories; don’t worry about carbs! Go ahead and eat your Grandma’s holiday cookies, and feel free to indulge in Dad’s infamous pancakes. Now that you are not forced to eat cafeteria food, enjoy your favorite home treats, guilt-free!
Get some rest. Now is your time to make up for those sleepless nights during finals week, so take a mid-day nap, or two! Go to sleep early, refuse to wake up late, and simply just enjoy your own bed.
Be a kid. Soon college will be over, our real life responsibilities will kick in, and we no longer will have the luxury of doing what we want, when we want.  So go adventure, go explore, go run around in the snow and do something silly. Christmas carol, build snowmen, create snow angels –let those childlike ambitions loose and just live it up.
Drink hot cocoa for breakfast. Nothing is better than chocolate in the morning, and this holiday season is the only time I’ll encourage it! Pour, sip and indulge in hot and soothing perfection.
Give back. We are all so blessed to attend such a wonderful University and be a part of such a beautiful and educational environment. There are kids out there who only dream to one day go to college, to one day go to a school football game, to one day have a warm cooked meal. Over this break, lend a helping hand and share your blessings with someone less fortunate. Whether it’s donating old clothes to the poor, visiting the sick, or volunteering at a soup kitchen for Christmas dinner –bring a smile to someone else this holiday season, and your selfless acts will remain in both your hearts forever.
Spend quality time with family and friends –for it’s what the season is all about.
Write a thank you letter to someone who helped you get by this fall semester. Whether it is a professor, a friend, or a staff member at Hillwood or Winnick Cafe, share the holiday spirit and show your appreciation.
The best present anyone could ever wish for is good health, and you have the power to grant such a blessing upon yourselves. Continue to work day in and day out on becoming the most beautiful person you could be, both inside and out. (And remember, with New Year’s Eve sooner than ever, don’t forget the mental and physical pain it takes fitting into last years little black dress.)
And last but not least, be happy for exactly who you are and be proud for all you’ve done. Have a wonderful holiday break, and a happy and healthy new year.
Best wishes,
Katie Crowley 🙂

Since the beginning of the year, the uproar for the newly instituted common hour has been a strongly disliked topic amongst students. But, for the new Red Mango that opened up in Wheatley Plaza, business is good.
“I see a ton of Post students in here during the common hour.” said Christian Mandarino, the manager of Red Mango. “ We make great sales during the week during that hour. We also get a lot of Post kids between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.”  It is not just C.W. Post that keeps Red Mango busy, but the surrounding area as well. “Everything helps, not only are we near two colleges in C.W. Post and NYIT, but there is an elementary school up the road, Pathmark is in this plaza, and there are a lot of high school kids that come in here. Location means everything.”
Mandarino also says that being around a few colleges inspired him to give students a discount on purchases. “If a student shows their student I.D. at the register, we give them one dollar off their purchase.”  The health aspect is also very important to the business as well, “I think the fact that these treats are healthy is what keeps the students coming back for more. Our original or small size contains only 110 calories.”
Red Mango is not the only business that is popular among students. Moe’s Southwest Grill is also a popular spot for lunch. “I absolutely see more Post students coming here during the common hour.” says Chris, an employee. “It’s not just Post students though; there are a lot of high school kids that come here too during that hour.”
One of Moe’s most popular features is the student discount that is given. “Since this place opened up, they started giving student discounts because of the location of the restaurant. If a student shows their school I.D., we give them 10 percent off their meal.” What makes Moe’s a popular spot is the great food, but Chris feels people keep coming back because of the service. “I think people keep coming back here because of how friendly we are to our customers.  Not only is the food great, but to have fast and efficient service is another great quality we have.”
With the holidays quickly approaching, the Old Brookville Police Department is gearing up for its busiest time of year. The holidays are about good times with family and friends, but it can also be a dangerous time. Between accidents, and crimes, P.O. McGinnis of The Old Brookville Police Department says that safety is a major concern. “Around this time of year we always put more guys on patrol.” P.O. McGinnis also had a few suggestions to students for the holidays. “When students go home for winter break, make sure everything valuable is taken home, laptops, video game systems, jewelry, and any other possessions of value.” P.O. McGinnis also knows of the new iPads that are being sold at C.W. Post. “If you leave your room for a long length of time during the day, either bring your iPad with you, or put it away safe. Don’t leave any valuables laying around in the rooms.”

Last Thursday there was a discussion in Professor Ryden’s Writing for Business class involving the school website. The contention  among the students was that the website, which just went though a major revision this past year, is still lacking. “On other schools websites, it is so easy to find what you are looking for. On ours you have to jump through so many hoops to find what you are looking for,” said senior Matt Marando.
Many students voiced comments about the ascetic look of the website, saying the focus seemed more on advertising the school than making the site user friendly for students. The web site is the image of the school. It is the first contact prospective students have with the school.
“Everything today is done online, high school seniors and parents are looking first at all the school websites,” says junior Natalia Zimnoch. “First impressions are really important; they could make or break a decision.”
The standout complaint is usability of the website. Students voiced their difficulty in finding information on the website. In comparison, students found the websites of other colleges in the area like Hofstra, St. Johns, and Stony Brook easier to navigate.
“Sometimes if I have to access my LIU from another computer I go to the C.W. Post website and stare for two minutes before I find the link to my LIU,” said Zimnoch “Everything is blended together and it’s all so confusing and complicated which makes everything harder to find.”
In Professor Ryden’s class the conversation turned to the location of the final exams schedule. On the old website the schedule was placed as a tab on the left side of the homepage. Now the schedule is located on the page that contains the academic calendar. Students joked that they had to Google, “C.W. Post final exam schedule” to even find the page. Comparing the other websites students found that finding their final exam schedules was a much easier process.
Not every student thinks the website still needs improving. “I like the website,” said Junior Taylor Williams. “It is self explanatory, and a much better set up then the older version.”
“The site needs to be easier to search,” says Marando. “We should not have to go to Google to find what we are looking for.” Many students agree the new website is a major improvement from the previous version; however, according to most students, there are still improvements to be made.
