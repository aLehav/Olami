Professor Susan Zeig, film director and chairperson of the department of communication and film, released her latest untitled short film, March. 31, at the KQED station in San Francisco.
Zeig’s passion for the film industry doesn’t stop at her classroom lectures. As a documentarian, Zeig looks at communities. Through her films, she comments on society, from economics to inequalities in the school system. Zeig first got involved in filmmaking following the climax of the political protest during the Vietnam war. “I ran a workshop for kids on the lower east side, where we taught filmmaking,” Zeig said. 
Zeig’s released her first film, “A Community Concern,” in 2010. It focuses on helping improve community and relationship between educators, parents and students. The film introduces the fact of community organizing and its faces.
“The idea’s not that complicated [fair and equal schooling opportunities], but the obstacles are ridiculous,” she said. Zeig believes that the only way people can have a collective voice is by community organizing. 
Zeig’s the released “The Long View,” in 2012 which documents the decades of inequality in the public education system in Oakland, Calif. The film brings together members of the community for a collective and impactful change, while showing how race, gender and ethnic background can affect schooling opportunities for children. Her latest film delves into the life of a character in “The Long View” that became a professional community organizer. 
Zeig currently teaches a class in video documentary and history of world cinema. She took over as chairperson of the department of communications and film in fall 2019, when Barbara Fowles, who held the position for many years, stepped down. 
Zeig plans on continuing her work in film and having the products reach the schools, universities and communities that would most benefit from the discussions they raise. “These films are meant for both big screenings and intimate sections,” Zeig said, as she recently signed a contact with PBS education, starting Sept. 1 of this year.

The men’s lacrosse team faced East Coast Conference rival, the Molloy College Lions, on Saturday, March 30 at the Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. 
After losing a close game 13-12 to the No. 1 team in the nation, Adelphi University, on March 20, the Pioneers won two games in a row against Roberts Wesleyan College (13-12) and Georgian Court University (19-6), with the hope of making it three in a row with a win over Molloy. “After the close loss to Adelphi, we knew we were going to have to work even harder,” Connor Farrell, senior face-off specialist, said. “We know we can be the best team in the nation; we’re right there. We just need to execute and finish more plays.” 
It took the Pioneers less than two minutes to score the first goal of the game when sophomore attackman Will Snelders, put a shot right by the Molloy goalie. Snelders finished the game with five goals.
 “When I have free time, I go out to the field a lot, shoot the ball on net to get my shot on point,” Snelders said about his preparation for the game. The Pioneers increased their lead as they outscored Molloy, 9-3, in the first half, with goals from Snelders, senior midfielder Steven Frank, junior midfielders Thomas Liantonio and Mike Kadner, and freshman attackman Jake Gillis. 
In the second half, the Pioneers continued to score with their high powered offense, outscoring the Lions 7-2 in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Molloy Lions scored two goals, but the Pioneers were too far ahead for the Lions come back. The Pioneers beat the Lions 17-7, achieving their third consecutive victory. 
Gillis ended the game tying Snelders, with a game high of five goals. Gillis and Snelders have almost identical statistics this season; Gillis has 38 goals and 13 assists and Snelders has 34 goals and 12 assists. 
“Jake and I are very close. Our chemistry is improving every game we play,” Snelders said. “We both learn from each other. He learns more of my style, using your body as your advantage and I’ve learned the Canadian stick skills he brought.” Last sea- son, Snelders was the team leader in goals; this season Gillis is leading the team in goals. “Last year, I had a target on my back. He helps make the target on my back smaller and now teams have to worry about both of us,” Snelders said. 
Connor Farrell ended the game with a perfect face-off record, going 22-22. “Every time I pick-up my stick for practice or a game, I tell myself I’m the best in the nation because facing off is all a mind game. If you think you’re the best, that’s exactly what will happen,” Farrell said. 
Farrell has a successful face-off percentage of 86.5 percent for the season, according to the individual statistics on liupostpioneers. com, making him the best face-off specialist not only in Division 2, but across all collegiate levels of lacrosse. 
The men’s lacrosse team will travel down to
Washington D.C. on Saturday, April 6, to face
East Coast Conference rival, the University of
the District of Columbia. Start time is set for 1
p.m.

Freshman lacrosse goalkeeper Hailey Duchnowski had an impressive debut in her first year on the team in their match against Merrimack College on Feb. 23 when she made 12 saves. She’s been a starter player in every game this season. 
As a new Pioneer, Duchnowski’s
favorite part of playing in gold and green
is the atmosphere from the team and
cheering fans. “Especially during games
when the crowd will come and support
you,” she said.

Duchnowski, a public relations and communications double major who grew up in Miller Place on Long Island, began playing both lacrosse and soccer in second grade. “I stopped playing soccer probably around third or fourth grade, and started playing field hockey,” Duchnowski said. Lacrosse has always been a big part of Duchnowski’s life “because my dad played and my aunt played,” she said. 
Her father played lacrosse in college
and had a huge influence on her game.
“My dad was always my coach growing
up,” she said, adding that he constantly
worked with her to improve her game.

The women’s lacrosse team won eight out of their ten games this season, and Duchnowski is aiming for a championship title. “My goal coming into this season was to win a national championship,” Duchnowski said, adding that the team works hard at every practice to achieve that goal. 
“I’m excited that Meg’s [Meghan
McNamara] still going to be the head
coach,” Duchnowski said about the Post
and Brooklyn teams merging. “Our team
is still going to be a team, we’re just
getting new faces, which will be nice,”
she said. Duchnowski believes that next
season will be a challenge because “we’ll
be playing teams we’ve never seen before
in a higher division.”

After college, Duchnowski has no
plans to abandon sports. “I definitely
would love to keep sports in my life after
college,” she said. If she doesn’t play
herself, she sees herself on the coaching
side. “Anything to just keep it in my life.”

 Dr. Cheng Zhang, assistant professor of chemistry, has been working on a project to convert carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into value-added chemicals and fuels like ethylene and propylene. 
“As the concentration of CO2 increases over the years, it’s really caused climate change, including global warming,” Zhang said. Zhang has been working with five students on this project: David Triger, a senior nutrition and dietetics major; Laura Bogen, a junior music major; Alexandra Leichman, a junior forensics science and chemistry student; Keolani Williams, a senior forensics science student; and Jiao Luyun, a senior chemistry student. 
Zhang has a similar project using methane (CH4). “Methane is a big component of natural gas,” she said. “Natural gas is very cheap in the U.S. But methane is very harmful as a greenhouse gas. So actually it’s more harmful than CO2 and a [big] cause of global warming.” 
Zhang wants to convert methane into methanol, a process she says will be significant to the society. “Methanol is a very important raw material also for many industrial processes. So in some industrial process to make ethylene and propylene, they use methanol,” she said.
Other projects include a paper on converting biomass and waste material into fuels in order to provide sustainable energy. This paper, “Essential Quality Attributes of Tangible Bio-oils from Catalytic Pyrolysis of Lignocellulosic Biomass,” is published in the Chemical Record Vol. 19 in March 14, by the Chemical Society of Japan. 
Zhang submitted an article on an industrial separation process she co-authored with Dr. Nicholas Ramer to the Journal of Chemical Thermodynamics on March 21. “We tried to use ionic liquid as a solvent to use in a separation process,” she said. Her unique approach is using green solvents. Ionic liquid is not as volatile as the organic solvent currently used in the industrial process and is thermodynamically stable. 
Her process works through the use of a catalytic approach. “We develop catalysts in a lab and the catalysts can efficiently convert CO2 or methane into ethylene or propylene. The process is simple and also very unique in converting waste material into more valuable materials. We turn waste into treasure,” she said.
Zhang loved chemistry in high school, and decided to pursue a chemistry degree at the China University of Petroleum in East China. She then came to the United States to complete her Ph.D. in chemistry at the Hunter College of the City University of New York. 
Zhang did not immediately go into academia, and instead worked in the field. After graduate school, she worked as a senior chemist and project leader for more than 10 years with the R&D center of Headwaters in Lawrenceville, NJ, for Celanese in Houston, TX, and for Scientific Design Company in Little Ferry, NJ, before she joined LIU Post in fall 2015. She has also been an inventor /co-inventor on 35 patents in the USA, South Korea (KR), China (CN), the European Patent Office (EP), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WO). 
She was motivated to become a teacher due to the positive impact her parents and her teachers had on her. “Bonding is very important between the teachers and the students,” she said. “I always felt like I want to do something different.” 
Her inspiration was partly due to her acquaintance with Dr. Stuart L. Soled, a distinguished research associate at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company and a fellow of National Academy of Engineering.
Soled told her, “Knowledge, when you share with someone and have impact on someone, [is valuable to yourself].” Pondering  this, she believed the scholar and student connection would positively impact society. “Those words really hit me at some point,” she said. 
Zhang believes her experience in industry helps her connect with students in the classroom with the real world application. Her work involves solving practical issues, such as how to convert carbon dioxide into sustainable energy. 
Every semester, five to ten students join the project for credit. Zhang’s students are from diverse majors, including  music, nutrition and biology, forensic science, and math. They take an interest in the practical possibilities of science, and she introduces them to the lab that she had built. 
As part of her project in converting chemicals into sustainable energy, she explained the connection between carbon dioxide and the materials we use (clothes, computers, smartphones) and expressed the project to them in terms of solving a problem for real-world purposes. She also showed them how to create a catalyst. The simplicity of the process amazed them, she said. 
This summer Zhang will mentor four students from the Brookhaven National Lab, two from the visiting faculty program (VFP) and two from the science undergraduate laboratory internship (SULI). The VFP program intends to increase the research competitiveness of faculty members and their students from historically underrepresented colleges, while SULI program are placed with members of the scientific and professional staff in order to gain research experience in areas such as chemistry, high and low-energy physics, nuclear medicine, and applied mathematics. Three of the students will be from Zhang’s research group. 
Students in the program will have access to the full range of facilities in the national lab, and can interact with scientists in the lab, according to Zhang. They can also get a $5,000 stipend during the 10 weeks from the Department of Energy (DOE).

 As part of Health and Wellness Week from March 24 to March 30, a Health and Wellness Fair was held in Hillwood Commons on Wednesday, March 27 during common hour. 
Many health related activities took place. At one table, students gave free massages to relieve stress. At another table, students were offering free condoms and also informing other students about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
A group of students in the nursing program gave free blood pressure screenings to about 40 students. Kayla Halper, a sophomore nursing major and health care administration minor, participated. She is a member of the new student nursing association on campus, which has a goal of becoming a “national student nursing association chapter.” At the blood pressure screenings, the students recommended follow up with primary care providers to those who needed it. 
Halper hopes to implement more health events on campus through the student nursing association. 
Other events during health and wellness week included a self defense workshop in the Pratt Recreation Center during common hour on Monday, March 25, Ask a Nutritionist Workshop during common hour on Tuesday, March 26 in Hillwood Commons, and a healthy cooking demo with Chef Romel during common hour on Wednesday March 27 in the Winnick Student Center.
The health and wellness fair, organized by Ashley John, director of student engagement, promoted the importance of seeking medical advice, monitoring and proper health care for students

 Vanessa Gardner, a junior photography major, worked on several projects during the spring 2019 semester, including a series of photographs called “Women of Color in Color,” which she hopes will encourage women of color to feel more vibrant about themselves.
“The series I add to most often is this project, a project I hope will highlight the confidence and vibrance inside every women of color,” Gardner said.
Gardner does her best to stay true to her original interests in photography by photographing nature. She hopes to do freelance work until she figures out what she would like to do with her skills. “I am leaning towards travel photography,” she said.
Gardner is currently taking darkroom and studio lighting courses in the photo program in the art department. These courses help her develop new skills. When Gardner isn’t on campus, she takes her photography skills with her on her travels.
“I took a trip up by Bear Mountain to run around in the snow taking photos,” she said. “I really enjoy traveling since I’m not a native Long Islander.” Gardner is from Mount Vernon, in Westchester County. “I’ve had a lot of fun driving around here [Long Island] and discovering new places to eat, hike and shoot photos,” Gardner said.
Gardner also runs a slowly growing business named VmgphotoCo. She started it in December 2013, in her freshman year of high school. Her Instagram account is @vmgphoto_.
“I have photographed kids’ parties, proms, school programs, camp photos, headshots, graduation shoots, and baby showers,” Gardner said.
When Gardner isn’t behind the camera, she likes to go bowling and horseback riding. 
Gardner is also an RA in Queens Hall; this is her third semester as an RA on campus. Gardener started in Kings Hall last spring semester. She loves to spend time with her residents. “I enjoy my job as an RA. I actually really like having the freshman buildings,” Gardner said.
Gardner has a passion for kids and hopes to work with high schools in the future. “I went to Thornton High School and was head of year-book there for two years; recently the school district changed the school to a performing arts school, and ideally, I hope to go back and contribute as a photography teacher,” she said.

 Happy Spring! We can finally pack away our winter coats and enjoy some warm weather! Since we all know that summer and beach season will be here in no time, and eventually the process of shedding ‘the “winter 10” will have to commence, I’d like to share some help-ful tips that can naturally increase the body’s basal metabolic rate.
While it may seem easier to walk yourself into the drug store and purchase some magical diet pill, they are often not the best choice. Diet pills are under no obligation to be checked by the FDA according to FDA.org, and have the potential for side effects such as vomiting, neurological and mood disturbances. These pills have also been known to contain hidden substances such as amphetamines, anti-anxiety drugs, and antidepressants, all of which can interact with medication and become addictive. The bottom line is that diet pills are a temporary and potentially risky fix that shouldn’t be our “go to” for weight loss.
Luckily, there are some simple ways that don’t involve diet pills to boost the amount of daily calories you burn. First is to try and increase daily activity levels via activities like going for a 20 minute walk instead of gluing yourself to the couch. Next is to cut back on daily consumptions of junk foods like chips and ice cream. Simple changes like these can burn up to about 300 calories more per day without even going to the gym. 
The number-one calorie burning food, according to the American College of Sports Nutrition, is hot peppers. Oddly enough, hot peppers have a chemical in them called capsaicin that triggers our body’s pain receptors. While doing this, blood circulation increases, as does metabolism. This is why some people break out into a sweat when consuming spicy foods. 
Green tea is another effective metabolism booster because it contains antioxidants that make it easier for the liver to breakdown fat for energy use. Additionally, green tea has the potential to stimulate the body to burn an extra 240 calories per day. Three to four cups per day should do the trick, however, avoid nighttime drinking since caffeine could lead to insomnia.
Increasing the amount of fiber consumed in a day to around 25 grams can increase the amount of calories burned by as much as 30 percent. Studies by NCBI show that fiber helpful insulin levels, preventing sudden crashes that lead us to grab quick, non-nutritious snacks throughout the day. In addition, fiber is a long term preventative measure for weight gain.
 A major rule of thumb when trying to speed up your metabolic rate, or at least keep it working at its optimal level, is to always be sure to eat enough. Don’t skip meals or portion yourself so much that you never feel satisfied. As your body is moving from source to source to find the energy to get you across campus to your next class, it’s simultaneously decreasing the rate at which it’s functioning so that, just in case food isn’t around for awhile, it will be able to preserve what it has in order to last longer.
Follow these steps and you’d be surprised at what can happen in just a few weeks. The key is to not deprive yourself of every tempt or crave. Slow and steady wins the race, but incorporating these points into a new regime of increased physical activity and adequate daily rest will undoubtedly show results. Not only will you see the difference, but you’ll feel more energized and ready to take on the day. Good Luck!

 Delta Zeta held its first Turtle Tournament on Friday, March 22 in the Pratt Recreation Center. The Turtle Tournament, named after Delta Zeta’s mascot, consisted of three rounds of kickball, basketball, and volleyball. Students from Greek Life, clubs and athletics participated in teams. A total of 60 people participated in the event.
Tau Kappa Epsilon won the event and earned $100 to donate to the charity of their choice, St. Jude Children’s Hospital.
Delta Zeta raised $1,800 at the Turtle Tournament, and donated it to the Starkey Hearing Foundation. The Starkey Hearing Foundation is an international nonprofit or-ganization that helps give “the gift of hearing” to people in various countries. Their services include hearing testing and providing hearing aids to those who need them. 
Jackie Duncan, a sophomore business management major and Delta Zeta’s vice president of philanthropy, came up with the idea for the tournament. As to whether the Turtle Tournament will happen again during the 2019-2020 academic year, “It depends on the vice president of philanthropy next year. Campus Life likes to continue traditions normally,” Duncan said.
The sorority holds small philanthropy events and one large event each semester. In fall 2018, that event was a male beauty pag-eant called Mr. DeZirable. For their small events, they usually hold sales during common hour, raising approximately $100-$200. The big events tend to raise much more money. The turtle tournament yielded the most funds the sorority has ever raised for an event

 Pioneer reporters encountered some issues last week while attempting to cover some of the scheduled events included in the LIU Promise email sent to students on March 25. 
In honor of health and wellness week, the movie “Super-Size Me” was scheduled to show on March 27 in the Gold Coast Cinema at 9 p.m. However, it was cancelled because those responsible for running the event did not show up.
The student employees working at the Hillwood Commons concierge desk said that although they had the movie on-hand, their supervisor advised them not to show it until someone responsible for the event was present. A phone call was never received that the event was to be cancelled, and no contact information for the event planners was provided. With no way to contact those in charge of the movie showing, and no explanation as to how to proceed, the Pioneer reporter went home without a story or review.
In addition to the cancelled movie showing, the email informed students about an “Elite 8 Sport Equipment Drive” to be held at 8 a.m. in Hillwood Commons on Saturday, March 30. The event directed donors to stop by the campus concierge with their contributions. When a Pioneer reporter showed up to cover the event, the campus concierge staff member was unaware of any drive scheduled that day or in the future. 
Sophomore biology major, Rondinio Rameau, who was working at the concierge desk Saturday morning, mentioned there had been no attempts to drop off any sports equipment since he arrived at 8 a.m. Had someone approached the desk to do so, Rameau wouldn’t have known how to assist them since he had not been informed about the planned event. “They didn’t tell us anything about that,” he said, regarding the drive. He questioned whether a notice was sent to students requesting donations. 
When presented with the listing, Rameau asked his co-worker, master of education student, Stephanie DiPreta, if she had any information to provide. “I don’t know anything about it,” she said. “A lot of people kind of just say, ‘Oh, everything is at the concierge,’ but they never tell us about it, so we never know.” 
Earlier in the week, representatives in the athletic department were also surprised by the Pioneer’s inquiries about the drive. Martin Guillet, associate director for recreational sports, fitness and intramurals, said it was the first he heard about the event. “I asked a few people who I thought might know about it and they were not aware of it,” he said. 
Upon returning to campus that following Monday, the Pioneer reached out to the LIU Promise office to question why the drive didn’t take place during its scheduled time. Residence director, advisor and coordinator, Julia Pagano, explained that the listing for the event was a bit confusing, and she apologized for any misunderstanding. The event’s information was included in the email to serve as a reminder to students going home for the weekend to gather any lightly used or new sports equipment that they no longer want or need.
 As of Monday, April 1, the campus concierge was aware and ready to accept student donations, which will be given to a Boys & Girls youth shelter in Westchester County, according to Pagano. “If they can’t do it today or tomorrow, students can bring it in over the next couple of days. We’re in communication with the organization, and we can bring the items whenever we receive them all,” she said.

 The Rainbow Alliance will host its first ever Rainbow Formal with the LBGT organizations at Hofstra University and Molloy College on Saturday, April 6 from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. A shuttle bus will transport students to and from the event at Molloy College, free of charge. The bus will leave from Hillwood Commons at 5 p.m.
The Rainbow Formal is a prom-like event where students can have fun and be themselves while enjoying a DJ and food. The goal of the event is to provide an inclusive space where students don’t have to worry about being judged for who they are. 
“One of the original reasons why we thought about something like this is [because] some of our members, and a lot of other people, said they had a bit of discomfort when they went to their proms at their high schools and being apart of the LGBT community,” Nicholas Frank, a sophomore game design major and vice president of the Rainbow Alliance, said. “Sometimes they wouldn’t even allow same sex couples. So for this we are really trying to say bring whoever you like.”
Being yourself isn’t the only thing that is encouraged; students are encouraged to dress as they like as well. “Semi formal attire is encouraged, but we want people to dress how they want to express themselves, so if someone shows up in a cowboy costume, no one’s going to stop them,” Nicole Ludwig, a sophomore psychology major and president of the Rainbow Alliance, said. 
A $1 minimum entry fee is required, but students are welcome to give more. All proceeds will go to Safe Center Long Island, a nonprofit organization that provides services to victims of abuse. The clubs sponsoring the event will pay for it.
This will be the first time the event is being held, but if it goes well, the Rainbow Alliance officers hope to host it again, and possibly to hold more events in conjunction with other schools. Students who wish to attend the Rainbow Formal can email Nicholas.Frank@my.liu.edu or Nicole.ludwig@my.liu.edu

 Students and administrators filled almost every seat in the Gold Coast Cinema for the fourth annual Take Back the Night event on Thursday, March 28. The event featured guest speaker Matt Baker, the director of public safety at Rosemont College in Pennsylvania and a survivor of sexual assault. 
Baker shared his story of being sexually assaulted for four years since he was nine years old. A man who watched Baker and his friends play on a motorbike for days lured Baker in by feeding into his love for motorcycles. Baker identified how the man “groomed” him, little by little testing the boundaries of how close he could get to Baker and earning his trust. 
Baker never told anyone what was happening to him, though he now wishes he had. He advised students to “stand up and say something” if you know someone who is doing something wrong. 
Baker’s abuse took place is the 1980s, when people dying of AIDS was the biggest news. When the abuse finally stopped, and Baker entered middle school, he feared that AIDS would take his life as well, but he felt that he couldn’t tell anyone what happened to him. With all of that bottled up inside, he became a bully and got into many physical fights. It wasn’t until he tried to attack a kid named Paul for wearing a belt that said “sexy” that some “divine intervention” made him stop. “I had a deep sense of shame and disgust of the person I’ve become,” Baker said.
From then on, Baker decided to change and stop attacking those who couldn’t defend themselves. He became the “bullies’ bully,” sticking up for those who didn’t have a voice. He encouraged the students in the cinema to be the better people in the world, and to always use these five words: “How can I help you?
”The Speak Out event, where students had the opportunity to share their own experiences, followed Baker’s talk. Students spoke on the stage, or submitted their stories anonymously in another room. Three students shared their stories in person, and a member of the Take Back the Night committee read the six anonymous submissions. 
Through these shared experiences, sexual assault and abuse was discussed in varying situations, including at college parties, in the home, in work environments, when alcohol was involved, and even within relationships. 
One of the anonymous writers who wrote about their fight to escape domestic abuse advised students to be wary and that “trust is something that must be earned.”
After the speak out event, campus life staff and members of the committee handed out glow sticks and asked people to crack them as they asked questions that applied to them. Students cracked the glow sticks if they know someone who has been assaulted, if there was someone in their family who has been assaulted, and if they wanted to “take back the night” and put a stop to sexual assault. 
Students lined up outside for a march around campus, following the red flags that started at Hillwood Commons and went on towards Kumble Hall, around to the Winnick House and across the freshmen quads, down the Chipmunk Trail, and back to Hillwood Commons again. 
During the march, students chanted, “People unite / Take back the night. Survivors unite / Take back the night,” and “Hey, hey, ho, ho / Sexual assault has got to go. The time is right / The day is here / Tonight’s the night / We take back the night. The time is now / The day is here / We will not live in fear,” and “Stop the violence / Stop the hate. Shatter the silence / Stop the violence. No more silence / No more violence.”
“The key message we want people to take away is that it [sexual assault] can happen to anybody, and anybody does it,” J. Fordsman, a sophomore psychology and criminal justice double major and a Take Back the Night committee member, said. “We always think ‘my brother wouldn’t do that, my cousin wouldn’t do that, they’re good people.’ But somewhere, someone’s cousin did do it. We have a responsibility to the people we love and care about to make sure that they don’t do it, and that if it happens to them that we support them as much as we can.”
Associate Dean of Students and Deputy Title IX Director Jean Anne Smith advised students who are victims of sexual assault, or students who know someone on campus who may be suffering, to visit her office on the second floor of Hillwood Commons, room 240. “My door is always open,” she said.
 Students can also seek counseling at the Center for Healthy Living in Post Hall, or by contacting Lynne Schwartz, the director for the center for healthy living, at lynne.schwartz@liu.edu.

Former Pioneer basketball player Tafare Berryman was killed at a nightclub on April 2, 2005. The crime was unsolved for more than a decade. On March 14, a member of a street gang called Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation pled guilty to the murder in federal court in Central Islip.
 “Nearly fourteen years ago, an innocent young man lost his life to senseless gang violence. Like his family, we do not forget,” United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Richard Donoghue, said in a press release the day of the guilty plea. “This case demonstrates our relentless pursuit of justice for the victims of gang violence and our determination to hold gang members accountable.”
Jaime Rivera, 34, along with other gang members, were at La Mansion bar and nightclub in North Long Beach on the night of the murder. Berryman, then a C.W. Post senior, was there with a group of friends, and a fight that started between gang members and a student inside the club moved outside to a parking lot. 
While Berryman and a friend walked from the club to the parking lot, his friend was hit over the head with a glass bottle. Afterwards, the two Post students drove off in a car. When Berryman’s friend pulled over to tend to his wound, Rivera drove up beside the parked car and shot Berryman once, thinking he had been involved in the previous fight.
U.S. Attorney Donoghue was grateful to those at the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Nassau County Police Department (NCPD) for their work on the case. Rivera will face up to a life term in his sentencing on Nov. 13. 

The Pioneer staff (‘05) gave a message to the campus community during the tragic week of events


 “This campus has suffered so much in such a short time. First we were dealt with the blow of losing Mr. John Farkas. Still, we go on, knowing that he lived his life well and that he would want us to continue on living life with as much heart and efort as he exhibited.Then, for those of the Catholic faith the passing of the Pope has been a somber time. Still, he was a man of honor that lived a long and virtuous life, which we can all respect.Now, we face the most shocking blow to our campus community. One of our students has been wrongfully taken. Tafare berryman was a young, outgoing, talented individual that had so much to offer. He should have been wearing a cap and gown in a couple weeks. He should have been able to go on, to have a chance to live up to his potential.We may never understand why tragedies such as this strike or why life may seem so unfair. It is times like these that we need to band together as a community. Our community has been shaken but we are strong. We will carry on not in spite of such esrth shaking events but because of these events. They remind us that there is a mystery to each of our lives. As a young boy in Poland in the 1920’s Karol Woj-tyla probably did not expect to live 84 years strong as one of the most distinguished people in the world. Mr. Farkas may not have expected to touch the lives of thousands of college students. Tafare Berryman did not expect to die that night, but he also may not have expected to touch the lives of the entire campus community.It is now time for us to comfort those that were close to him and wish for peace to e with him.”- The Pioneer, 2005
