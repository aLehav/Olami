Editor’s Note: Karis Fuller is the Arts & Entertainment Editor of The Pioneer.
Senior sociology major Karis Fuller finished the Metropolitan Championship at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J. on Sunday, Feb.24 in fifth place, with three first-place victories.
Fuller’s success combined with strong performances from other swimmers, such as junior math and physics major Elizabeth Law who came in second place in the 200-medley relay, led to a fifth-place for the Pioneer team.
Fuller is no stranger to winning and she expected nothing but victories during the weekend. “I expect to win; I’ve gone three years undefeated in the 200 backstroke and two years undefeated in the 200-individual medley and 100 backstroke,” Fuller said.
One of Fuller’s close friends, former swimming team member and alumna of 2018, Elin Kvarnemar constantly follows the success of her former teammate.
Kvarnemar works at a Swedish candy shop in Manhattan as a shift leader, so she was too busy to see Fuller compete, but she cheered from distance. Her expectations on Fuller at this year’s championships were high.
“I 100 percent expect for Karis to win at conference. Karis would have to literally miss her races for her not to win,” Kvarnemar said.
Despite living up to every expectation, Fuller was fatigued for the weekend, swim coach Kristen Foley said. “Karis was not as rested for this meet as the rest of the team because we already knew she’d be going to the national championships. 
Despite that, she raced hard and won all of her events. She came through for her team and I feel confident that when we get to Indianapolis for the NCAA Division II swimming championships, she will swim faster after tapering and resting,” Foley said.
Fuller agrees on her not being as rested as she could have been, but with nationals only two weeks away she didn’t want to ease up her training. “I didn’t see a point in dropping my training when I had already qualified my place for nationals in November,” Fuller said.
Coming up next for Fuller is the NCAA Division II championships in Indianapolis at the IU Natatorium on March 13. Fuller hopes that her last three wins will translate to more.

Snowfall hit New York during the night between Friday, March 1 and Saturday, March 2, causing cancelled and postponed sports games.
              The football field covered in snow 
Many of the Pioneer sports teams were affected as fields and roads were covered in snow on Saturday morning. The equestrian show at the Olde Towne Equestrian Center, the women’s lacrosse team’s game against Bentley University and the baseball team’s game against Pace University were all cancelled due to inclement weather.
“It’s really unfortunate that our show got cancelled, but at the same time I think it was for the best. We are outside all day and it’s not fair to the horses if the weather is bad and the show ring is in a bad condition,“ sophomorenutrition major Hedda Walltott, a member of the equestrian team, said. 
The weather isn’t only causing changes for the teams and athletes. It also affects the athletic department and the people arranging the games. With a limited time schedule, things sometimes get tense. “Those times get a little bit stressful,” Casey Schermick, director of athletic media relations, said.
“It’s a combination of trying to get the facilities ready for play and making sure that people know what schedule updates have been made so everyone is on the same page.”
The men’s lacrosse team was scheduled to play at home against Pace University at 1 p.m. on Saturday, but the snow-covered field led to an hour delay. “It was about five of us administrators who were out clearing the bleachers, trying to move as much snow by hand as we could to make the field playable and to make a safe environment at the stands,” Schermick said. 
The decisions determining whether a game gets cancelled is made by the facility staff, the head coach of the team who is supposed to play and athletic director Debbie DeJong. When a decision has been made, the head coach passes the information to the players and the opponents and the athletic department informs the public.
“We will send out a notification through social media saying the game has been postponed due to inclement weather, or whatever the circumstances may be, and we also post updates on the schedules on the website,” Schermick said.
While the teams in New York struggled with the snow, the softball team flew to warm and sunny Florida for their first games of the season. “We are very excited to be starting our season, especially in warm weather,” Katie Humhej, pitcher and junior health science major, said. The softball team always has to adjust to the weather and due to the weather in New York, the team has been practicing in the gym instead of outside on their field during preseason. 
“It was much different playing on an actual dirt field compared to a gym floor, but it felt fantastic,” Humhej said. The switch from the gym to an outside field went smoothly and the team won their first game of the season against no. 1 ranked Saint Anselm College. This was the Pioneers first win against a no. 1 team in the program’s 44 year history.
Ashley Melendez, infielder and senior childhood & special education major, said the win was a great feeling. “It was a great way to start off our last season. The win meant a lot to us considering last year we dropped two games against them in the super regionals,” she said.

For years, movie studios have been making famous music artists biographical movies (biopics) like “Jersey Boys,” “All Eyes On Me,” “Straight Outta Compton,” and most recently “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Now Netflix is featuring its first music biopic, “The Dirt,” the story of the notorious band, Motley Crue.
The trailer for “The Dirt” was released on Feb. 19, showing clips of how Motley Crue started and all the wild and crazy stories that gave the band their reputation. The movie is based on the book “The Dirt: Confessions ofthe World’s Most Notorious Band,” written by band members Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Tommy lee, and New York Times writer Neil Strauss.
Motley Crue was formed by lead bassist Sixx and drummer Lee. Soon after they found lead guitarist Mars through an ad in their local paper, and soon after that, Lee recruited Neil to become the lead vocalist and front-man. Lucas Lauer, a junior accounting major, is a Motley Crue fan. “Motley Crue is one of my favorite bands,” Lauer said. “My dad grew up on their music and I would listen to them when he would play their music and just fell in love with them. I can’t wait for this movie to drop on Netflix.”
Some college kids have never heard of Motley Crue, but may know some of their songs like “Kickstart My Heart,” “Home Sweet Home,” and “Smokin’ In The Boys Room.” Others were unfamiliar with the band. “I’ve heard of them, but never really got into their music” Samantha Uebel, sophomore broadcasting major said. After listening to their popular songs, Uebel recognized the songs from previous movie soundtracks. “This movie looks really interesting. I’m going to watch this movie with my dad because I know he grew up listening to them,” she said.
Students can read the book “The Dirt: Confessions of the World’s Most Notorious Band,” and can watch the trailer on YouTube, or wait to see the Netflix movie when it is released on March. 22. Get your popcorn ready.

The Steinberg Museum of Art will be getting three-dimensional, as 20 of the Art Studio Foundation students will host the “Dignity-3D Challenge” on Wednesday, March 6.
The exhibit will feature sculptures based on photos by Dana Gluckstein, a famous author and photographer. Winn Rea, chairperson of the art department addressed the meaning behind the upcoming event.
“The photos Gluckstein took are important because they influenced former president Barack Obama to sign on to the international rights for Indigenous people,” Rea said.
Sophomore art education major, Jonathan Meyer will be participating in the exhibition. “Each person sketched out their own concept for a wood sculpture based on the photographs displayed in Gluckstein’s Dignity Show Everyone has come up with some very creative takes,” Meyer said.
During the exhibition, visitors will be asked to do their best at matching the sculptures to Gluckstein’s photographs, which is why Meyer is keeping his idea a secret.
“My idea is a secret for now; you have to come down and do the dignity challenge during the show,” Meyer said. The reason why it’s called the Dignity Challenge is because each piece of art is based off of Gluckstein’s series “Dignity: In Honor of The Rights of Indigenous People.”
On the other hand, freshman, graphic design major, Loren Beyer is not keeping her idea a secret. 
“My idea isn’t a secret, but the premise of the show is to figure out what photograph you choose to do. I chose the drummer boy photographic,” Beyer said.
The reception will be held at the Steinberg Museum of Art in the library on March 6 from 5-6 p.m. For more information, call the Art Department at 516-299-2984.

If you’re underage or just not into drinking, St. Patrick’s Day might feel like a downer. But there are many ways to have just as much, if not more, fun than your of-age friends.
On March 11 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Hofstra University is hosting an Irish festival where you can enjoy authentic Irish food, listen to music, visit vendors and more. Tickets are $6, $5 for ages 65 and older, free for ages 11 and younger.
The Long Island Aquarium in Riverhead is hosting a fundraiser for the developmentally disabled.
The St. Patrick’s Day themed event includes live music from Beatles’ cover band Strawberry Fields, Irish food, raffles and a chance to watch someone in the “Shark Tank Showdown.” The event is on Thursday, March 15, from 6-10 p.m. Tickets are $65, $25 for children ages 2-12.
In NYC, a less pricey, but equally as fun option, is Sober St. Patrick’s Day. It’s a celebration of Irish culture sans the booze.
Entertainment includes live Irish step dancers, music, food and refreshments. It is on Saturday, March 16 at the St. Patrick’s Youth Center Gym at 4 p.m. Admission is $25, $10 for children under 10.
There another sober St. Patty’s Day at Our Lady Queen-Martyrs Church in Centerport, Long Island.

If you find yourself in NYC on St Patrick’s Day and care for a good laugh or two, head down to the West Side Comedy Club, which will feature stand-up comics from Ireland as well as showcase unique international perspectives. 
It’s on Sunday, March 17 from 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Entry is $5. 
For something closer to campus, you can join the Glen Cove St. Patrick’s Day parade, hosted on March 17 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. After the parade, there’s a family friendly reception at the St. Patrick’s Parish Hall.

Jacqueline DeStefano (15’) self-published her first collection of original poetry entitled, “Water Lilies,” released in June 2018. Since its release, the book garnered success among the author’s target audience: young men andwomen seeking motivation and healing. “It’s not long-winded; it’s concise and clear-cut, it’s real,” DeStefano said about the book’s structure. 
“I don’t know necessarily that this book was written for an audience of young men, but I do think it’s for the thinker,” Raphael Anthony, a reader who was referred to The Pioneer by DeStefano, said after reading “Water Lilies.”
The collection covers topics such as love, loss, friendship, family, bullying, and more.
DeStefano meant for this to inspire growth and healing. It also covers matters such as recognizing mental illness like depression. She hopes readers find the purpose and value in themselves.
“It embodies many different experiences and feelings and elements of growth that a person of this age group may have already experienced or might experience going forward,” DeStefano said. She started assembling this collection when she was 15 years old. “From 15 to 25, that’s a decade, I’d say, of exponential growth,” DeStefano said.
“It really shows how a woman can change over time,” Christina Principato, a friend of DeStefano’s, said. “I really think that it brought out specific features of my life that I was able to relate to within the book.”
The poetry is interpretable among a diverse audience. After reading certain poems, Anthony was able to take away messages that had meaning to him after interchanging the pronouns the author used. “When you read it [the poetry] from a guy’s standpoint, there’s a message of true love and finding someone that can love you the way that you deserve to be loved,” he said.
 The title “Water Lilies” was inspired by advice DeStefano, 25, got from her mother when she was younger. “She would use the analogy to ‘take it one step at a time, pretend that you are on a water lily and you’re focusing on the moment that you’re in at that point,” DeStefano said. “And then from there, you leap to the next pad, and that leap itself is the strength it takes to get from one life [experience] to the next.’” The illustration of a young girl jumping from one lily pad to another on the front cover reflects this concept. “You can’t take on life all at once,” DeStefano said. “That alone can be overwhelming.”
One poem entitled “Louder than his Lips” stood out to Anthony. “It’s about finding someone who can tell you that they love you without actually saying it and just getting it from the way that they look at you,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what your preference is or who you’re in love with, it’s just finding that emotional connection with somebody.”
Principato enjoyed a poem in the book the author wrote for her future son. “It describes how over the years people will judge you and treat you in different ways, but you are who you are,” she said.
Though she is Catholic, DeStefano’s poems near the end of the book are written based on Christian beliefs. “God, for me, is everywhere. He’s in every part of my life,” she said. “He’s ever-present, and for me, something that’s ever present would be embodied [by] water.” Furthering the symbolism of floating water lilies, “I know that [God] is the body of water that is under all these lily pads that I’m jumping over in life,” DeStefano said. “And if I were to ever fall short on the leap to my next pad, I’m notafraid because I fall into Him.
“[There are] definitely a lot of strong poems about God and faith in her book,” Anthony said. “That was a big takeaway for me that I personally loved and enjoyed.”
DeStefano received her Bachelor of Science in Accountancy and a Master of Business Administration in December 2015, and she is pursuing a career in writing going forward.“Both worlds have benefited me tremendously,” she said. 
Currently DeStefano works as a certified public accountant for a firm on Long Island. “I wanted to use my writing and my knowledge of business to fund the publication of my writing.” 
She enjoys being able to express creativity and emotion through writing. “I know I definitely have an aspiration to write another book, more in the sense that it promotes self-awareness,” she said. 
The author received positive responses about “Water Lilies” via social media. “I will never know the effect of how far my book will go, and that’s okay with me because it’s not for me,” she said. “I know that it’s going to heal and touch lives, and that’s all that matters.”
“I would absolutely recommend this [book] to someone going through a tough time because she opens up about hardships that she’s had,” Anthony said. For people struggling with situations such as losing a loved one, they can identify with what the author experienced. Right after, they’ll be able to read about how she overcame those challenges.
“Water Lilies” is available for sale at www. barnesandnoble.com and www.amazon.com. It is also available through iBooks as an e-book. For more information about the book, visit www.jacqann.com, follow DeStefano on Instagram @jacq.ann or on Facebook @waterliliesbyjacquelineann.

Professor Jennifer Rogers-Brown, associate professor of sociology in the department of social sciences has conducted research regarding advocating for women’s rights and the rights of migrant workers.
“My current work around justice for migrant workers stems from my long-time research in Mexico on the impacts of free trade policy on rural corn farmers,” Brown said. “I’ve seen how policies around food and agriculture, as well as immigration policy, have resulted in divided families and global inequality,” Brown said.
Brown received her BA from UC Irvine, and her PHD in sociology, with a doctoral emphasis in women’s studies, from UC Santa Barbra. She is the president of the Board of Directors for Rural and Ministry (RMM), a nonprofit organization in NY State. “I love working with this organization because they work directly with farm workers and rural workers, focus on empowering new community leaders, and prioritize the need to change unjust systems like racist labor laws and oppressive immigration policies,” Brown said.
Brown is a part of the LIU Post Center for Sustainability and is passionate about protecting others and the environment. “I consider myself an anti-racist, feminist, environmental sociologist, she said. “Environmental racismand structural inequalities must be addressed in order to have a sustainable future.”
Brown is working on several projects in her field such as supporting the Farm Workers Campaign and holding a town hall on campus for NYS farmworkers. She also is a lead representative for the Sociologists for Women in Society and holds events geared towards issues impacting women and girls. “We are showing the documentary ‘Red Light Green Light,’ which is about human trafficking, and afterwards we will have a panel of local activists and academics to talk about their work on the Suffolk County Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force,” Brown said.
Brown has opinions regarding migrant workers, immigrants, and minorities and how they should handle life inside and out of school.
“RMM is a non-profit organization in NY State. This organization advocates for rural and migrant families, workers, and youth throughout the state,” she said. “I love working with this organization because they work directly with farmworkers and rural workers, focus on empowering new community leaders, and prioritize the need to change unjust systems such as racist labor laws and oppressive immigration policies.”
“I encourage students to take advantage of being at a university,” Brown said as advice to students. “Join a student organization that has social justice as part of its mission. They may have more years of experience and can provide support in ways you may not expect,” she said.

Some people often underestimate the power of the liver. The liver plays many vital roles in the body, such as toxin removal, nutrient absorption, bile production and protein production. It’s the heaviest organ in the body and contributes to 21 percent of the body’s basal metabolic rate, meaning it requires more energy than any other organ in order to function.
With all of the critical functions of the liver, we should take actions in our daily lives to support its overall health. This is becoming increasingly harder to accomplish in today’s industrialized world. Substances like gasoline, dryer sheets, and other seemingly harmless things such as perfumes and colognes are all items we are exposed to on a daily basis.
Recent studies confirmed some fragrance chemicals used in popular perfumes have been found deposited in surface liver tissue, suggesting they may not be completely harmless.
A study done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information exposed mice to some of the most common perfumes and colognes sold on the market. The study concluded that after exposure, mice had decreased expiratory airflow and showed symptoms of neurotoxicity such as lack of coordination and decreased neurological function.
While there are many things that are beyond our control that can negatively affect the liver and body such as air pollution and other environmental toxins, it’s important to know that there are preservative actions each one of us can take on a daily basis.

Jonathan Ortiz (’09), who graduated with ac bachelor’s degree in criminal justice, is challenging incumbent Jose Serrano in the 2020 Democratic primary for the NY-15 (Bronx) seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Ortiz’s name is already on the ballot. Jose Serrano has held the seat since 1990. When asked if he has talked to the Congressman or his team, Ortiz said “I have not reached out to him or inquired about it, because I honestly don’t care. A guy like me [will be] direct to him.” He believes that Serrano hasn’t recently taken on any mainstream issues. “All he has been working on is street naming, and things that don’t matter to the community. Proposethings that are going to impact the mental health of my community. I’m a ‘do-er.’ I believe in doing.”
The Pioneer reached out to Congressman Serrano for comment, but has not heard back as of the time of publishing.
Yet, Ortiz still has high regards for Congressman Serrano. “I nonetheless respect him, and I honor him because he opened the door for Latinos and Blacks in the Bronx. If it wasn’t for people like Mr. Serrano, we wouldn’t have the representation we have in government right now.” Ortiz said.
Ortiz says his top three priorities are student loans, mental health, and affordable housing.
“As a part of mental health, I include universal health care for everyone. I don’t care if you’re a refugee. As soon as you’re American, you get healthcare.” He believes affordable housing is not affordable to those who need it. “Basing affordable housing on a person’s net income after federal, state, and local taxes” is a more appropriate approach than basing affordable housing prices off of gross income.
“The Capitol feels a little outdated. While the Constitution never changes, it needs to be applied to work in the times we live in, and not in the 1700s.” Ortiz said, addressing the political climate. “We are Americans. Those of us who came here through the immigration process, those who were born here, we’re all on the same page. It’s not like immigrants want something that we don’t want.”
As a student at C.W. Post, Ortiz worked for the admissions office and as a kitchen manager at Winnick. Ortiz said that he valued most about his time at Post “The connections made. The friendships I made at Post I carry every single day since I started there. I still have a group chat from my time at Post.”
Since graduation, he has been working at the pilot branch of the Financial Empowerment Center in the South Bronx, and is currently the Director of the Financial Empowerment Center at Phipps Neighborhoods. “It’s a program that was started by Mike Bloomberg,” Ortiz said.
“They basically started off in the South Bronx to help people rise above poverty by offering them free financial advice.” The center offers help with financial literacy, financial education and financial coaching to about 2000 clients annually and 25,000 clients since the program’s inception in 2008.
Following the center’s success, the program has been replicated nationally.
Ortiz has been featured as a financial expert and advisor on programs such as Telemundo, Univision, Bronx News 12, El Diario, Bronxnet, New York 1, Unimás, and in the Wall Street Journal.
Ortiz offered advice for students. “No matter where they see themselves on the political spectrum, they can contribute and collaborate, and see themselves as part of a bigger picture,” he said. 
Students can follow Ortiz on Instagram @jortizfinancetv.

The core curriculum and peer mentor program were recognized by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AACU),the leading national organization dedicated to advancing the standing of liberal education, at the conference “Creating a 21st-Century General Education: Responding to Seismic Shifts,” on Feb. 14-16 in San Francisco.
Fr. left: Dr. Abby van Vlerah, Michele Dornisch, and Nancy Frye in San Fransisco
Dr. John Lutz, chairperson of the English, philosophy, and foreign languages department, Dr. Margaret Boorstein, professor of geography and the chairperson of the earth and environmental sciences department, and Dr. Abby van Vlerah, the former dean of students, presented their panel “Pathways to the Majors: Fostering Interdisciplinary Collaboration Between Liberal Arts and Sciences and Professional Schools” at the conference.
“We explained to them how we had meetings throughout the summer, open to any faculty members, and from that we developed ideas about how our core should be structured, so this was cooperation and collaboration, which are usually good things to do,” Boorstein said.
Lutz, Dr. Nancy Frye, professor of psychology and the graduate director of the psychology department, and Dr. Michele Dornisch, associate professor of education, also presented a panel on the peer mentor program called “Mentoring Matters: Feelings of Belonging and Self-Efficacy in First-Year Students with and without Peer Mentors.”
“The overall idea is that we want to create opportunities for students in all areas to take courses that are related to their areas of interest and at the same time provide them with the basic skills and wisdom that is found in the liberal arts and sciences,” Lutz said.
Their presentations went through a review process before being chosen for the meeting. “We presented what the faculty at Post created. And before we presented it, we had to write up an abstract and explain how we’re going to explain this to our audience,” Boorstein said.
“And we chose to do a workshop and so it was received by AACU and they decided that our workshop was good enough to be presented at their meeting.”
Lutz finds that the core curriculum and the peer mentor program at Post respond to a major shift in the perception of the value of liberal education.
“I think in the 20th century, you could make the better argument for the importance of the liberal arts, but it’s being challenged in some areas.” he said.
Lutz wanted the AACU workshop audience to recognize the value of collaboration when constructing curricula. “My hope is that even the larger benefits to this campus is that collaboration has lasting benefits, that different divisions and units are able to work together to advance this new curriculum and also hopefully the other aspects like the peer mentor program also develop as well.”
Frye’s findings about first year course Post 101 indicated that the presence of peer mentors increased a sense of connection between students. “One of the goals of changing the core was to make the core courses more relevant to students and make them feel like they’re more active learners,” Frye said.
Frye sees the peer mentor program as an innovative force in education and on campus.
“I think at Post and education in general, we’re working to have students see the connections between what they’re learning in the classroom and other aspects of their lives,” she said. 
 The reception at the conference for the Post findings was positive, Frye said. Though the main focus of the peer mentor program is in Post Foundations, she would find it interesting to see how peer mentorship could be applied to other classes.

The women’s lacrosse team, ranked no. 6 in the nation, looked to improve to a 2-0 record as they faced Southern Connecticut State University on Wednesday Feb. 27. They got out to an early lead and did not look back.
Junior midfielder Brianna Feldman was the first player to score 37 seconds into the game. Later they had a 9-0 run to close the first half with a 10-0 lead.
Six different players scored goals in the first half including midfield captains Alyssa Mallery and Paige Sherlock. Mallery had a strong performance as she ended the day with a six goals, the most goals a single player scored during the game. 
“It’s never easy, but because of my teammates, I wouldn’t be able to do it without the help from them,” Mallery said.
Freshman goalie Hailey Duchnowski was able to make six saves and went nearly 80 minutes without giving up a goal, including their previous game against Merrimack. “I think that a solid defensive unit can take credit for part of that,” Duchnowski said. “As a team, we worked hard to keep up our communication and it was really exciting to see the results.”
 Junior attacker Angela Deren was also highly involved in the team’s win with one goal and four assists. “I had a great day, but there’s always room for improvement, so I can continue to contribute to the team,” Deren said.
Along with the other two attackers, junior Jill Lamanto and sophomore Jamie Alvino had a combined total of nine assists on the day.
“We go out every day in practice and work on developing a chemistry,” Deren said. “It’s really important to know how each and everyone of your teammates play and what their strengths are, so we can give them the right feed.”
Southern Connecticut State University didn’t score until there were 18 minutes left in the game and the powerhouse offense of the women’s lacrosse team overpowered the visitors. “As a team, we managed to keep our strong defensive skills and increase our offense with a better shooting percentage.” Duchnowski said. “Off the draws, we were very strong and never gave up on all the ground balls, especially when SCSU had the ball, we worked hard until we got the ball back or managed to give them little to nothing to shoot at.” 
With hard work and hustle on both offense and defense, the final score of the game was 15-5. “It’s awesome that the hard work we put in during the week pays off on the day of our games,” Mallery said. “It’s important to implement what we learn in practice into our games and I really believe we did a really great job doing that against SCSU.”
The women’s team look to improve their record to 3-0 as they take on Pace University, ranked no. 14 in the nation, on Wednesday, March 6 at 3 p.m. at home. Their game against Bentley University on Saturday, March 2 was postponed due to inclement weather.

Two artists showed their dynamically different work side-by side in the S.A.L. Gallery from Feb. 26 to March 3. 
Karen Cohen displayed a collection of nude photography entitled, “Naked Ambition,” and Chie Kim highlighted her mixed media and acrylic paintings in her collection, “Histories of Self Portrait.” Both collections hold importance to the artists that created them.
Continuing her undergraduate ambitions about her fascination with nude photography, Cohen put together this exhibition for her master’s thesis. “I started doing my undergraduate 30 years ago with film and then I transferred over to digital to finish my master’s.”
Cohen’s undergraduate thesis was in 1987, and developing the technique for working with a digital camera has been one of the biggest challenges she faced.
The photographs are printed on canvas, and each picture was taken through a sheet of wavy glass which distorted the subject behind it. There is a lot of experimentation with colored lights depicted in the photos as well. “I place the light in different areas, and when I go and look through the viewfinder, that’s where I start creating,” Cohen said. The neutral skin tones of the subjects allow for the mixing of colored lights to create bright colors, while the glass gives the impression that the photos are instead paintings. “I really love the mystery of [the pieces], and you’re not sure whether it’s photography or a painting, I love to confuse people,”Cohen said. 
For this reason, all of the photos are untitled. “I feel they don’t need a title, I would really like the viewer to decide what the title should be,” she said.
 Cohen printed on several different types of media before settling on canvas. Having done multiple prints and contact sheets, she chose which look she preferred.
“There’s so [much] new technology now to print on besides just paper,” she said. One option for her was stainless steel. “I did maybe four or five different [media] in all different sizes,” she said.
Afterwards, she discussed what worked and what didn’t with Allison Rufrano, adjunct professor of art.
“She comes from an analog background and an experimental one,” Rufrano said.“You can see in the the work that she still has that experimental aspect in her.” 
Cohen’s daughter is the subject of one of her photos and inspires much of her artistic work. “She’s one of my favorite subjects to photograph,” she said. “She’s always been a role model for me in bringing me up to the modern world of technology.” In the photo, a mysterious air comes from the subject’s expression as she looks away from the camera.
“Karen has such a comfort level; you can see the comfort in her models, so you can see the connection and the sensitivity she has to her subject,” Rufrano said. “I think that’s most important.
Kim shared the gallery’s spotlight with her collection of works detailing her transition to adapting to life in America. One of her more prominent pieces entitled “Encyclopedia” portrays Kim’s life story.
“When I came to America, the encyclopedia was my only friend who helped me to understand the new environment,” Kim wrote in her artist statement. “[It inspired]me and [led] me to another world.”
She carried an encyclopedia with her when she came to the U.S. in 1963 and said it was hard to adjust to the country without familiarity with the English language.
“Encyclopedia” depicts items of personal significance that helped Kim along her journey, such as the emblem from her previous school, Sookmyung Women’s University, as well as a pair of gloves and a pair of flat shoes. Kim used to wear high-heeled shoes often, but they became inconvenient as she had to rush to attend extracurricular English classes. “That’s why I cut off high shoes and [made] them flat,” Kim said.
The painting “Encyclopedia” also depicts a degree, representative of Kim’s academic ambitions.
“Based on my knowledge, I trained my courage,” she said about the depiction of her former school’s badge. “My college stimulated me to go to the United States, a very advanced country and I had to learn new things.”
Another painting, “My College,” depicts a mirror with a face painted into the glass. This represents Kim watching her past, present, and future. “The mirror is showing my self-identity with hard circumstances that I had to face,” her artist statement reads, “Even though the situation was hard, I tried to be optimistic and hope for [a] better future.”
Some of Kim’s paintings depict her original poetry printed to look like pages of a book. The poems were written in alternating Korean and English. When she painted, pictures came to mind, and when she wrote, the stories also inspired a picture. The images seemed alike to Kim so she incorporated them both into one piece.
Kim’s mixed media pieces are composed of items she found outdoors. Her piece “Flight of the Butterflies” focuses on a forked branch that she spray-painted in different colors. “When I take on new media, I really have a hard time, but I learn a lot.” Her professor Seung Lee gave her a lot of influence in creating the projects. “It gave me hope for what I have to do for the future [in] my life,” she said about Lee’s influence.

Emily Pius, a senior marketing student, is working with her father Donald Pius, a landlord in Huntington, and her alma mater, the Stony Brook School, to create a scholarship fund for a student to go to the Stony Brook School, a private college preparatory, co-ed boarding and day school for grades 7-12 in Stony Brook, N.Y.
 According to Pius’ GoFundMe page, “The applicants will submit an essay that will be reviewed by myself and the Stony Brook School.”
The child selected would be one that is coming from a low income family and in a difficult living situation and despite that is working very hard in and out of school.
The Pius Family Foundation will donate $10,000 to this effort, but it will not be possible without your help.” The Stony Brook School will provide $45,000.
She has been working on this fundraiser, which will contribute toward the selected student’s boarding, food, and education, since January.
Currently it’s intended for one student who is a low-income tenant of one of Pius’ properties in Huntington Station who shows potential.
“He or she would be in multiple clubs at the school, maybe has to help raise certain brothers or sisters he or she may have, and help out in the house, they may have to find a job to help their family out. They just have a lot going on, but have a lot of potential,” Pius said.
Pius feels that Stony Brook School provides a great opportunity for students to achieve their potential.
“This school also has a very good name to it and they have a 98 percent [rate] of students attend college. They have a very good culture there, good community, with the faculty all living on campus so they’re very close to the students and it would just be a good life-changing opportunity for the student that’s chosen.”
Pius went to Stony Brook from seventh to twelfth grade. “I really think this could have a good impact on the kid’s life,” she said.
She appreciated the family-like faculty and the small community spirit during her experience at the school. She was involved with soccer and track on the campus.
The Stony Brook School, founded in 1922, is an independent Christian preparatory school whose motto is “Character Before Career.”
Notable alumni include Peter Thomas, a television narrator; Clayton Daley, former chief financial officer of the Procter and Gamble Company; Jacques-André Istel, founder of the Museum of History in Granite; William G. Bowdler, an American diplomat; and Sarah Drew, an actress known for playing Hannah Rogers in the TV series “Everwood” and Dr. April Kepner in “Grey’s Anatomy.”
Pius hopes to work in real estate after graduation.

Students can celebrate International Women’s Day (IWD) on Thursday, March 7 with a presentation about the history of the holiday and women’s empowerment.
The event is organized by Jacqueline Duncan, a sophomore business management major, and is sponsored by The Body Shop, a British cosmetics, skin care and perfume company. Duncan is a student ambassador of The Body Shop, a role she took on in August 2018.
Along with a presentation of a timeline of successful and influential women throughout history, there will be free giveaways of sample products from The Body Shop. Students can also enter a free raffle for a chance to win a gift basket full of a range of beauty and care products. The Body Shop has lines of womens and mens cosmetics, so the basket can be altered depending on the winner of the raffle. 
The event features guest speakers Lynne Schwartz, director of the Center for Healthy Living, and Dr. Jennifer Rogers-Brown, associate professor of sociology.
Brown said she looks forward to engaging with students. “I plan on talking a bit about the history of International Women’s Day and what it means today. I’m interested in connecting it more to students and how it affects them today,” Brown said.
“I think that this day is not only going to make women appreciate the strength and resilience of women as a whole throughout history, I think it’s going to make them realize how far we’ve come and still how far we have to go,” Duncan said.
The International Women’s Day event will take place in the End Zone on Thursday, March 7, during common hour. The event is free entry, and will also have free pizza and refreshments.

Editor’s Note: Jack Georgis is The Pioneer Newsletter editor & assistant online editor.
Students were notified that summer and fall registration would be moved up, via email from Beth Wilkow, university registrar, on Tuesday, Feb. 5. 
Enrollment for the summer and fall 2019 classes began on Feb. 13, nearly a month earlier than last year’s registration, which began on March 5.
The email did not explain why the change was made.
According to the email, students who wish to register for classes must be “in good financial standing and have an enrollment date listed on MyLIU.” 
But the earlier registration date posed issues for some students whose financial aid hadn’t yet cleared for the spring 2019 term.
Jack Georgis, a sophomore computer science major, said the earlier start was confusing.
 “On Feb. 20, I had my meeting with my Promise coach. I finished making my schedule at [the Promise office] and then went to my computer on MyLIU to register,” he said. “When I put in to confirm, I had a hold on my account. It said that it was because my account balance was overdue.”
After searching on his MyLIU account, Georgis realized he didn’t owe an overdue balance, but instead his student loans won’t finish distributing until the next month.
“The registration took place before my loans could distribute,” he said. Georgis was able to register the next day as the hold on his account disappeared. 
But not all students find an issue with the earlier registration. Ashley Rodriguez, a junior accounting major, believes the earlier registration helped make her registration process easier.
“I work full time while going to school, so I like knowing ahead of time what my schedule is looking like,” she said. “I tend to only do classes on either Tuesdays and Thursdays or Mondays and Wednesdays, so I feel like [early registration] gave me a greater flexibility to see what classes would be offered and kind of change around my schedule for senior year.”
In terms of the efficiency of the new date for registration, Rodriguez said the earlier time had no negative effect on her registration process.
“It was pretty easy,” she said. “I was able to meet with my Promise coach on [Feb. 13] when it initially opened up, and then I enrolled on [Feb. 15].”

Overnight snow didn’t stop the men’s lacrosse team from gearing up for a home match against Pace University on Saturday, March 2.
Although the team suffered its first loss of the season against Pace, 10-7, they displayed an impressive offense. Following an hour-long weather delay, the team marched onto a landscape of Pioneer colors: a field of green surrounded by a ring of snow under an unanticipated golden sun. 
Five minutes into the game, the Pioneers were up 2-0 with two assisted goals. The lead was short-lived when Pace scored its first point less than a minute later. Pace closed out the first quarter leading the match 4-2.
Women’s lacrosse player Payton Napoli, a freshman special education major, braved the cold and observed the game from the sidelines. 
“I would say this is an evenly matched game. Though they’ve had better games, they’re still playing pretty well,” she said during the match.
In the second quarter, The Pioneers’ defensive measures took a downturn. Pace continued its lead, gaining two additional goals.
Halfway through the quarter, the referee called a holding penalty against Pace, creating a boost in the Pioneers’ offensive strength, and a sea of chanting boos from the opposing side. With just over four minutes remaining in the period, Pace ran out the shot clock, placing the ball in the Pioneers’ possession.
Senior midfielder Steven Frank scored a much needed unassisted goal, leaving the Pioneers’ behind by three points at the quarter’s end.
After halftime, both teams returned to the field, each securing a goal just five minutes in. At 10:25, the referee called a one minute penalty against the Pioneers for unnecessary roughness.
Despite being down one player, sophomore attacker William Snelders snagged the team’s fifth goal, assisted by sophomore defenseman Ryan Blume. The Pioneers were flagged again less than two minutes later, their fourth of seven penalty for the game. 
In response to the call, a man in a Pioneer sweatshirt yelled from the bleachers, “Another penalty, ref? This is men’s lacrosse; let them play.”
The Pioneers gained a sixth goal before time expired in the third quarter. But, it wasn’t enough to get in front of Pace, which scored two goals during the period, helping their team to enter the fourth quarter with an 8-6 lead.
Junior Pioneer midfielder, Mike Kadnar, scored the team’s final goal at the start of the period.
The Pioneers’ attempts at redemption fell short due to a strong defensive performance by Pace, causing them to suffer its first loss of the season. 
“We played hard but there’s lots we have to work on,” junior attacker Thomas Liantonio, said. “We’ll get them next time.”
Senior faceoff, Connor Farrell, snatched 14 ground balls for the team, and senior goalkeeper Bryan Ochs, defended the net with nine saves. Snelder led his team in goals scored with a total of three, followed by Frank, who scored one and assisted in two. Kadnar, Liantonio, and freshman midfielder Jake Murphy each scored a goal.
In their next match, the Pioneers play against national championship title holder, Merrimack College, in a home game on Saturday, March 9 at 2:30 p.m.
