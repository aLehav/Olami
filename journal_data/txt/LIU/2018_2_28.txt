The 120-credit bachelor of science in forensic science degree in the department of chemistry, according to the LIU Post website, prepares students for rewarding careers “in the laboratory departments of police departments, medical examiners’ offices, toxicology and pathology.” The program integrates lecture courses with laboratory work and hands-on field experiences.
Yet, some students in the program, have voiced concerns about the laboratory equipment available to them.
Jamie Licausi is a senior forensic science major, only months away from her graduation. She has studied the subject she is most passionate about for four years, attending classes, interning, and preparing to eventually enter the workforce as a forensic scientist.
There’s only one problem – Licausi feels that Post has not provided her with the education she paid for. “In the laboratories, a lot of the time we don’t have instruments that work,” Licausi said. According to Licausi, her professor had to cancel a class meeting one day due to not having the equipment to carry out an experiment.
The class was supposed to use a particular instrument necessary to see what chemical was in a sample, but that day the few instruments that were available to the students were unusable, outdated and easily breakable.
Licausi said that at first, her education at Post seemed to be satisfactory. It wasn’t until she interned at the Westchester County Forensics Lab that she realized she did not have the tools she needed for the workplace. “At an internship, they expect you to have used these instruments before,” Licausi said, “and I hadn’t been given that experience [at Post].”
In addition to this, Licausi, who had originally planned to double major in forensic science and chemistry, discussed the recent end to the B.S. in chemistry degree. Students can still get a B.A. in chemistry, but according to Licausi, this is a less science-based degree.
Dr. Cheng Zhang, professor of chemistry, agrees that the lack of a B.S. in chemistry degree has affected students. “We want to have a bachelor of science [in chemistry] because it is more focused on science,” Zhang said. “We no longer offer it, and that has affected some students.” Zhang also agrees that there is a need for new instruments for the students working with her on her research project in her lab. “We have instruments on campus- some are good, but some are very old. We would love to have funding to purchase more instruments for the program.” According to Zhang, the students in the chemistry department still thrive without the instruments, but their dedication is the exact reason they need the opportunity to work with more tools. “My students do great work. Students from the program went to Washington D.C. to present their work and two won national awards. Only 100 in the nation win this,” Zhang said. “I hope that people will see that we need these instruments for our research.”
Neil Edwards, the chemistry department laboratory manager, also expressed disappointment with the end of the B.S. in chemistry degree. “I think we lost a few chemistry majors because of it,” Edwards said. “Traditionally, if you want to go to grad school, you get a bachelor of science degree. I don’t understand the decision, but it is not in my hands.”
Edwards said that updates have been made in the chemistry department, but that the biomedical department is in more need of updated equipment. “In biomedical, things like the gene analyzers are outdated and need to be replaced,” Edwards said. “I think the equipment [in chemistry] does the job it is supposed to do. I hope to see updates in the next few years, but it is not as needed right now in the chemistry department as it is for genetic equipment.”
Edwards said the last set of updates to the laboratories in the chemistry department took place five years ago. “All of the labs received updated fume hoods, which are an integral part of the lab in terms of safety,” Edwards said. Within the last four years the department also added two new research laboratories, he said.
Cece Amayo, a senior biomedical science major, said that her education has been affected by the lack of instruments available to science majors.
“In chemistry, we have equipment that is outdated. The lab set up is outdated, too. Most other labs [at other universities] have better instruments,” Amayo said.
“At Post, money isn’t going into science. We are not getting the education we pay for,” Amayo said. “It doesn’t look good for the university.”
Dr. Vladimir Fainzilberg, a chemistry professor, agreed that the program needs equipment updates. “We need an update of practically all equipment, especially in forensic science. The equipment in that program is outdated,” Fainzilberg said. “In chemistry, we have good mass spectrometers, and very good FTIR, used in organic chemistry analysis. But we badly need an update on gas chromatographers.”
Although the department has requested funding for updated instruments, Fainzilberg said the “cries remain in vain.” Fainzilberg said, though, that “compared to other departments in the college of arts and sciences, we must treat ourselves as a “lucky” department. Administration was kind enough to update our general chemistry labs about five years ago, and we are now considered as state-of-the-art for entry-level chemistry courses, even compared to Ivy League universities.”
Fainzilberg added that the administration “also has the intention, which still only remains an intention, to update the organic chemistry laboratories this coming summer. But, we are still short on equipment and especially short on full-time staff, which ultimately hurts our students and affects the quality of education.”
For Licausi and Amayo, both seniors, a change in the curriculum and updated laboratory instruments would be a good start.
“I would like to see the money go where it is really needed. We are the next generation of doctors and nurses. Money should go to student education,” Amayo said.
Licausi also hopes that by speaking up about the issues within her program, she can make her voice heard and inspire change on campus.
“I want to make our program the best it can be,” Licausi said. “And I want to be able to be proud when I say I graduated with a forensic science degree from Post.”

The offie of public safety has responded to the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida with tightened security plans for the campus. There have been no incidents of shootings on campus, although some students and professors have raised concerns about safety procedures.
Alexa Kaplan, a junior business marketing major and commuter and business manager of The Pioneer, lost a relative in the school shooting in Florida. -“This particular shooting hit me a little harder emotionally,” she said. “I became a lot angrier and eager for a change in our society.”
Kaplan, who transferred to Post from Syracuse, wants the open campus policy at Post to be monitored thoroughly. “When I was at Syracuse, there were a bunch of security booths scattered at main points and entrances on campus who would stop people in cars and ask to see their student or faculty ID. I think we should do that here,” she said.
SUNY Old Westbury also has a security booth at its entrance. All visitors to the campus must “report first to the University Police Department to obtain a visitor parking pass,” according to the university website, oldwestbury.edu/police/parking
Security booths, or guard posts, are located at the west gate before the library. Michael Fevola, director of the office of public safety, said the booth, which is not covered every day, is secondary to campus patrol and response actions. Many commuter students have said they do not see a guard there in the mornings.
“The officer that is there goes when he is available, usually during the morning rush,” Fevola said. The officer is assigned Monday through Thursday, unless he is responding to a call, according to Fevola.
Fevola said an open campus is dictated by the type of community  a campus is in. “Brooklyn campus is closed, because that’s the way the city is. Here [on Long Island], campuses want to be a part of the community we are in,” he said. Violence and crimes are less likely to occur at Post, according to Fevola, who stated that Brookville has a “much lower average in crimes than the national average.” The U.S. national average crime rate is 278.8 percent, while Brookville is at 67.3 percent, according to City-Data.com collective data of murders, rapes, robberies, assaults, burglaries, thefts, auto thefts and arson in the United States.
Last semester, there was a reported break-in in the South Residence Hall, and several computers were stolen from the labs in Humanities by a local thief – who was caught and arrested – according to the university’s crime log records and reported by local news.
“The overwhelming issue we have had with people that are not part of our campus community and come on campus are property crimes, not against people or any type of violence,” Fevola said. To combat suspicious activity and/or persons, students and faculty are expected to follow the “see something, say something” protocol by reporting the issue to Public Safety at 516-299-2222.
Depending on the severity, one or more officers are dispatched to respond to the call. “We encourage people to call in suspicious people, but leave a description, what the person is doing [and] a call back number to get back in touch,” Fevola said.
An adjunct professor in the English department expressed concern for security on campus grounds after the high school shooting in Florida. “We aren’t even able to lock our doors [in Humanities]. What is the safety plan we have for this school – there’s nothing,” she said.
Public Safety officers began listing classrooms with doors that can be locked from the inside and which ones cannot. “We are looking at different ways to be able to secure classroom doors from the inside in the event of a lockdown,” Fevola said. These locks must be compliant with re marshal codes; certain types of deadbolts would not be allowed.
Along with door locks, additional cameras have been added to Humanities, and the Fine Arts building will receive more in the next week, according to Fevola. “All cameras on campus are 24/7, and the vast majority of them operate on motion, that’s to save space. We are constantly adding new cameras to different areas strategically,” Fevola said.
Fevola said that the most important thing to do is educate the campus community on active-shooter protocols. “In the event of an incident including an active shooter, Public Safety has protocols in place and the ability to immediately alert the entire campus community via a mass text/email blast with specific advisements and instructions,” Fevola said in the Nov. 29 article “LIU Post Campus Shooting Guidelines” published in The Pioneer. The guidelines are at http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety. Next week, a Public Safety app detailing the “see something, say something” and “run/hide/ ght” protocols among others will be available for students to download on both Apple and Android devices.
Fevola gives this advice: be aware of your surroundings. “When leaving the academic buildings, take different exits, get familiar with the building,” he said. “We are creatures of habit. When we leave, we go down ‘this’ stairwell because it’s the closest one. If you’re not in a hurry one day, explore the building, go out a different way.” Knowing your surroundings could be valuable in an emergency.
At the request of members from the Student Government Association (SGA), Fevola has set up a pilot program in Brookville residence hall to allow student access to side doors. The program authorizes Brookville Hall residents with ID to open side and rear doors. Residence halls only have cameras in the lobbies, according to Fevola, which is why entrance to the side doors is not allowed. “We want to be able to see on the camera who’s coming in, especially if the guard that is there had any type of issue, or the RA or desk attendant,” he said.
They are exploring the possibility of side/rear door access. Cameras are already put in place at Brookville side doors to monitor who is walking in and out. SGA wants to prove that with side door access, people won’t prop the doors, which is a common security risk in residence halls. “Students don’t always want to walk all the way around the buildings to get inside,” Fevola said. “If we get good feedback, we will continue that for other dorms.”
Editor’s Note: Alexa Kaplan, mentioned in this article, is the Business Manager for The Pioneer.

Last week, The Pioneer published a story entitled, “Students Complain about Undercooked Food.” The Pioneer is republishing a statement provided by Aramark District Manager, Simone Harper-Register.
“We take all customer concerns about food quality very seriously, and investigate every concern that is brought to our attention. We learned about the this concern through social media posts but the product was not brought to a manager or staff member so we cannot validate it.
We served over 185 portions of meat on the evening of Jan. 31 and did not receive any concerns. In addition, we checked the daily menu logs that we keep for every item cooked and served, and found that the meat was cooked to proper temperature specifications.
Nothing is more important to LIU Dining than food safety and the customer experience we deliver. We encourage anyone with a concern about their dining experience to contact any of our Managers on Duty in the dining location, or one of our associates, so that we can provide immediate attention to any concerns, comments or suggestions on the spot.
We did use this as a teaching moment with our staff to reinforce our food safety processes and procedures which are industry leading. We maintain rigid standard operating procedures for the entire flow of food production. This includes providing an environment that protects the safety and integrity of food from its delivery, throughout its storage, preparation, transport, and ultimately, to the point of service to the customer.
Our food service staff is also engaged in a learning environment that includes a food safety orientation before associates start work, ongoing manager and associate food safety training, and job-specific training to continually reinforce safe practices.
We are committed to providing a positive, safe, and healthy dining environment and we will continue to take all necessary precautions to ensure food safety and maintain a quality dining program for the entire campus community.
Please feel free to contact myself or one of our dining managers with any other concerns you may hear from the campus community.”

The LIU Post chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) hosted a free headshot event on Thursday, Feb. 6 in the Pell Hall photography studio. SPJ encourages students with backgrounds in journalism to take advantage of training opportunities and tools for their careers.
Justin Capalbo, professor of photography and Post alumnus, took student photographs to use for professional portfolios, resumés, websites and LinkedIn. The event was free for all students. “Our goal at LIU is to try to prepare students for the workplace, and we try to give them as many different opportunities as possible,” Capalbo said.
Over 40 students were in attendance with majors ranging from nutrition to business. “I thought it was a wonderful experience because headshots can get pretty expensive and it’s good for it to be professional looking,” Tiffany Miller, a political science major and journalism minor, said.
Tracy Zeal, a senior nursing major, enjoyed her experience. “I don’t want to take an immature picture, so taking professional pictures would be better for me and my professional career,” she said.
This was Capalbo’s first time taking headshots for students. “It was a wonderful experience working with the LIU students from all different majors and to give back to the LIU Post community,” he said. While SPJ hasn’t been as active in the past, the new co-presidents, Jada Butler and Dondre Lemon, sophomore and junior journalism majors respectively, plan for more events in the future. “We are hoping to have guest speakers from the New York Times and tours of studios such as FiOS1 or News 12,” Lemon said.
“We want to give our members real world experience, and hopefully what we have planned will be interesting and helpful for their careers,” Butler said.
SPJ is still taking more young writers to join in future events and trips. SPJ has a fee of $37.50 for a one-year membership. Students can sign up at www.spj.org.
Editors Note: Jada Butler and Dondre Lemon are the News Editor and Assistant News Editor of The Pioneer and are featured in this article as the co-presidents of SPJ. Tiffany Miller is also a staff writer for The Pioneer

Susan Gottehrer, the director of the Nassau County Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), spoke about immigration issues affecting many students in the community on Feb. 20. Her organization provides training to immigrant communities to be aware of “what the issue is of, who is responsible, and who has choices to make,” she said. The talk, arranged by Amy Freedman, chairperson of the political science department, was held in the End Zone in Hillwood Commons, and attended by over 20 students.
Gottehrer discussed the important issues that immigrants face when Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) arrive to detain undocumented individuals.
“Police in Nassau County are working with them and we are advocating for our local police to stop afiliating with ICE; in order for the police to do their jobs effectively, they have to have the community’s trust,” Gottehrer said.
Gottehrer mentioned the issues that an undocumented immigrant faces when approached by authorities.
“The police and the undocumented person will talk to each other, then the local data base will link up to federal and ICE agents and then the person’s undocumented status will be revealed,” she said.
“Language-barriers also is a present issue when ICE knocks on their doors,” she said. They often can’t stand up for themselves.
Gottehrer added that Temporary Protected Status (TPS), Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and the Mara Salvatrucha gang (MS-13) are being improperly used to label many immigrants today in the U.S.
“There are people in the immigrant communities who run away from MS13 and they are frightened; because of the loss of TPS and DACA, people are becoming nationless. Removal of bodies are happening in this country and if this is happening, it better be happening constitutionally,” Gottehrer said.
The NYCLU’s message to authorities, Gottehrer said, is “If what you are doing is constitutionally ok, then it is ok for us to question.”
Gottehrer provided students with procedures that immigrants should be taking if ICE approaches their homes.

On Oct. 13, 2017, LIU Post introduced 25 new bikes on campus, available free of charge to students, to enhance the beneficial effects of exercise and a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Due to the large size of the campus, using bicycles not only reduces traffic and parking congestion, but also improves the physical health of students, and allows them to effectively move from one building to another in a timely fashion. The bikes were initially stationed at Post Hall, Brookville Hall, in front of the Library and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls, locations where there is heavy student traffic. Students were able to choose a bike from any location by putting in the code 1954 to unlock it, and drop it off at the stations nearest to their destination.
According to the email sent by President Kimberly Cline introducing the bikes, “The bike program uses the Honor System.” The bikes were available to students at no charge, no advanced requests, and no identification required.
According to a mass email sent by Michael Berthel, dean of students, on Jan. 31, 25 new bikes were purchased and arrived on campus. The school continued to make them available by an honor system.
Nneka Carroll, a freshman biology major with a focus in pre-med, constantly uses the bikes to get to and from classes during the week. “I love that there are now more LIU bikes because it makes transportation to class and practice easier for more students; especially in the cold. However, I hate that they are always broken,” she said.
Other students have similar complaints about the maintenance of the bikes. “I hate the LIU bikes because they’re thrown around campus and broken,” Gabriela Fernandez, a freshman criminal justice major, said. Jahdai Harthernandez, a freshman forensic science major, agreed. “One thing I dislike about the bikes is that sometimes they’re hard to find on campus and they aren’t taken care of when people use them so they end up being no longer useful,” she said. On Sunday, Feb.18, senior broadcasting major Abraham Orenstein observed a broken bike thrown in the fountain in front of Humanities Hall.
On a recent Monday afternoon, bikes were observed in front of Kumble and Humanities Halls and either left on the ground or propped up a the walls instead of being placed in designated bike stands.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, has not responded to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the introduction of the new bikes or their maintenance.

Most health conscious individuals are aware about appropriate carbohydrate, protein and fat intakes. Something, however, that almost 95 percent of Americans are ignoring is fiber. Often we associate fiber with prune juice, bran and many other cringe worthy foods, and while it’s true that these foods have the highest fiber content, it is possible to eat a fiber rich diet without getting queasy.
We may not always consider fiber a nutrient, but according to the American Dietetic Association it certainly is. Even more, this nutrient is incredibly important for supporting the body’s detoxification mechanism, energy maintenance, and overall athletic health and performance.
Fiber is a complex-carbohydrate that sourced from a variety of plant-based foods such as fruits, veggies, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds. The two forms of fiber that are found in nature are insoluble and soluble. Insoluble ber supports digestion and the elimination of toxins while soluble ber helps steady blood sugar, aid intestinal nutrient absorption, and ensure proper hydration.
Perhaps the most significant component of fiber is its detoxification properties since we are exposed to many ‘hidden’ toxins in our daily lives such as food, tap water, and the environment. The daily recommended amount of fiber for men and women under 50 is 38 grams and 25 grams, respectively and since only 3 percent of people consume this amount, attention should definitely be given to this vital nutrient.
It should be noted, however, while fiber has many benefits, high fiber meals should be avoided right before exercise since consuming it puts the body into a ‘rest and digest’ stage in which blood flow and bodily energy is focused into the digestive system, not to the muscles. Also, drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day in conjunction with consuming fiber is crucial since fiber absorbs water in your digestive tract and can lead to constipation (eww, i know) if there’s not enough water present.
Of course, before changing your diet around and increasing your fiber intake significantly, you should consult with your healthcare provider to make sure it would be a beneficial component to your life.
