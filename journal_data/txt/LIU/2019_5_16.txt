As an alum (of the business school) and a
retired LIU employee I am shocked and saddened to see the announcement of the
new mascot. Did no one realize that Suffolk Community College in Selden, just a
few miles down the road, have been the Sharks for years!  Could no one at LIU come up with a mascot
that would not duplicate a community college and yet be unique to LIU and the
Long Island area?  So disappointing.
