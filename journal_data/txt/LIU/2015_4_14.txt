Relay for Life will be held at the Pratt Recreation Center on April 17 from 5 p.m. – 5 a.m. The event will raise awareness and money in an effort to find a cure for cancer. The event is open to the public, and students are encouraged to bring friends and family.
Teams of students will camp out around the track, and then each team will take turns walking. “We walk all night because cancer never sleeps,” said Campus Life Coordinator, Arianna Livreri.
Other activities at the event will include food, games, obstacle courses, music, prizes, and a survivor and caregiver speech. Last year, there were 70 teams total. This year so far, eight teams have signed up to participate in the event. This is the second year LIU Post has held Relay for Life. Last year, students raised $50,000, and LIU Post hopes to beat that goal this year.
Post has already raised over $19,000 this year for the cause. There are numerous ways for students to raise money. They can hold a table during common hour, or hold events with admission to enter. For example, The Runway raised over $1,000 by charging admission at the front door for the fashion show on March 27. Students can also put a link for donations on social media asking others to join their team. For assistance with ideas, students can go to Livreri’s office in Hillwood Commons, room 217.
The chairs of the Relay for Life committee are Patrick Bell, a graduate student and Political Science major, Sarah Knapp, a junior Sociology and Pre-Med major, and Ammar Obeidat, a senior Biology and Pre-Med major. They are working with a committee of seven students, as well as with clubs such as Twice as Nice, The Runway, the Commuter Student Association, and the Student Government Association.
“In my opinion, Relay for Life is an important event here at Post because it works as part of the American Cancer Society,” Bell said. “I think that cancer is something that closely impacts almost everyone on this campus in some way, whether it’s having had cancer themselves or a close family member/friend that had it. It gives us one thing to rally together and dedicate our efforts as a community towards.”
To take part in the event, students must either register online or pay at the door to enter. To join a team or donate, visit www. RelayForLife.org/liupost. For more information contact Post-Campuslife@liu.edu. To volunteer at the event, contact Livreri at Arianna.Livreri@liu.edu. Weekly meetings about the event are also held on Wednesdays in Humanities Hall, room 121, during common hour.

On March 26, LIU Post’s custodial and mechanical unit workers, as well as Local 1102 RWDSUUFCW members, stood outside the main entrance of campus protesting for a fair contract. The group of protestors called upon the school’s administration to create a fair contract, and allow for fair treatment of the members in their union.
As stated on the Local 1102 website, “The Local 1102 RWDSU/ UFCW is a labor union affiliated with the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union District Council of the United Food and Commercial Workers. Their primary function is to represent the needs of its members by fighting for fair treatment in the workplace, job security, quality healthcare, and a dignified retirement.” Local 1102 has represented the custodial and transportation mechanical units at LIU Post for almost 20 years.
According to the communications director for the Local 1102, Janna Pea, the union workers have been attempting to negotiate for a fair contract since Oct. 2012. She alleged that the school’s management has been unwilling to comply with the needs of its union workers. Yet, according to Gale Haynes, Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, and Legal Counsel for LIU, “the University has made repeated efforts to arrive at a mutually workable solution, one that fairly compensates the 75 Local 1102 employees in a fiscally responsible manner.”
“I have been working here nearly 16 years, and have always been proud to be a part of Local 1102,” said Bob Picard, a custodian in the maintenance department. “For three years now, my coworkers and I have been fighting for a new contract that includes a pay raise and adequate health benefits, which is long overdue. It’s time for the administration to quit stalling and give the workers what we’ve earned,” Picard said.
The administration vehemently denies the union’s claims. “The University’s goal is to meet our employees’ needs in a way that will not negatively affect our ability to provide a high quality, affordable education to our students. After a decade of tuition rate increases averaging 5.2 percent annually, the university is proud of our commitment to annual tuition rate increases of 2 percent or less through 2020,” Haynes said.
According to the RWDSU, Local 1102 members currently have a benefit package that includes healthcare (free medical coverage for employees and their family members) funded entirely by LIU Post. On average, LIU Post contributes over $14,000 a year for each employee to have good quality medical coverage. The cost of the benefits increases each year, and therefore need to be adequately funded – these contributions have not increased since 2012. LIU is not offering a wage increase for the union members to keep up with the high cost of living on Long Island. They are, however, offering a higher rate of pay to employees who are new hires. This rate will create an environment where long-term employees are less desireable and valued.
“Through its mission of access and excellence, the LIU community remains committed, above all else, to the educational needs and interests of our student body. The university will continue to bargain with Local 1102 and carefully balance both the needs of its employees with its mission of ensuring an affordable student experience that is unparalleled in academic opportunities. Our first priority is the education of our students, and it is important to us that there be no disruption to university life,” Haynes added.

Do you have any friends or family members who have been diagnosed with autism? The Delta Zeta chapter of Alpha Xi Delta is promoting awareness and raising money for children who suffer from autism. April is Autism Awareness month, and Alpha Xi Delta has been very active around campus to help the cause.
According to Olivia LaRocca, a junior Biology Education major, and philanthropy chair for Alpha Xi Delta, Autism Speaks is the sorority’s national philanthropy. On April 2, which is Autism Awareness Day, she and other members of Alpha Xi Delta lit up the fountain in front of Humanities Hall in blue, and made blue coffee stickers to show their support. They also had raffles and bake sales to raise funds for Autism Speaks.
“This is my first semester as philanthropy chair, but since I [was] initiated in fall 2013, I have been passionate about raising money and awareness for Autism Speaks. All the money raised towards Autism Awareness will help in research, family services, advancement, and advocacy,” LaRocca said. “It’s important that people embrace the uniqueness of people with autism because we generally have a poor perception of their abilities. By providing monetary relief we could make people more aware of the Autism Society,” she added.
For the 2014- 2015 school year, Alpha Xi Delta has raised $1,750, and still have a few more fundraising events this semester, according to LaRocca. One of LaRocca’s sisters, Marielisa Andaloro, mentioned how this means the world to her and the sorority.
Nobody knows what causes autism, but Alpha Xi Delta is attempting to provide a piece of the puzzle as a symbol for trying to find an answer. “Children who have autism generally need one-to-one intervention, and many don’t receive enough [help],” LaRocca said.
LaRocca said that the Autism Speaks effort stresses that people have a better understanding and knowledge of what causes this disability, and how to treat people who have it. “These children slowly process [what you speak] when you speak to them, and their brains can only process a certain amount of information at a time. Those who are on the autism spectrum are also usually speech and language impaired, but many autistic people are brilliant in their own unique way. Although children on the spectrum learn differently, they’re actually learning the same material as the average student,” she said.
Alpha Xi Delta’s slogan, “Individually Unique Together Complete,” sends the message that people with autism are different in special ways, LaRocca explained. “Alpha Xi Delta Listens,” is another quote that explains how the sorority understands what autistic people go through during their lives, and how they have a more complicated journey to be successful. “Some of the sisters in our sorority have siblings who suffer from autism,” LaRocca added.
Alpha Xi Delta is collecting money not only to find a cure, but also to change the lives of families who deal with autism. They also believe it’s important to learn more about different people on the spectrum, and try to help them through their difficulties since we’re surrounded by people with autism every day.
Autism affects one in every 68 children and is the fastest growing disease, according to Autism Speaks. Boys are nearly five times more likely than girls to be diagnosed. “All of my sisters and myself hold our national philanthropy very dear to our hearts, as we all try to raise money and awareness for Autism Speaks. My sorority has received so much support from fellow Greeks and students at LIU Post in our fundraising efforts,” LaRocca concluded.

Ke$ha is set to perform at LIU Post’s 2015 Spring Fling concert on April 29. The artist’s latest album, “Warrior,” was released in 2012, and her latest hit featuring Pitbull, “Timber,” was released in 2013.
Ticket prices for the concert range from $15 for students with an LIU Post ID card to $38.40 for the general public through Ticketmaster. The Student Government Association, which provides each student organization with a yearly budget, decides post’s Spring Fling budget; the money for the concert is included in the Association of Campus Programming’s budget.
According to Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, the concert is funded by students, run by students, and completely planned for students. Berthel added that the event can cost from $60,000- $100,000, depending on the artist and the year, and that the budget fluctuates based on the amount of artists booked, the type of artist, and even the day of the week on which the concert is held.
“Most of the budget for the spring concert is allocated to bring in the best artist possible; however, there are other costs including production, security, and promotion,” Berthel said. “Obviously, the more well-known and popular the artist, the more money it costs.”
Berthel said the Spring Fling concert is one of the biggest events of the year, and that it is a great opportunity for students to come out and enjoy campus life. Berthel said the campus likes making well-known artists affordable for students to enjoy the experience. “Having the Tilles Center on campus is a great resource, and allows Post students to see artists and shows that other college students don’t have the opportunity to see,” Berthel said.
Adelphi also booked Ke$ha to perform at their spring concert on April 23, hosted by their student activities board, according to Lauren Purcaro, Adelphi’s Senior Assistant Director of the Center for Student Involvement. The concert is being held in Adelphi’s gym for the first time this year. The cost of that concert is not available since the university signed a non-disclosure agreement stating that they cannot discuss the terms of the contract, according to Purcaro.
Kaitlyn Veygel, a junior Broadcasting major, said that she has seen Ke$ha in concert twice, approximately two years ago, at the Jones Beach Theater. She said that both times she had decent seats and the tickets were no more than $25 each time.
Veygel does not find Ke$ha to be worth the amount of money that it appears she is being paid, which, according to Campus Life, is between $60,000-$100,000, because of the fact that she is irrelevant. “She hasn’t even had her own single for at least two years now. She wasn’t even on the survey for who should come to Post.”
All of the 24 students who were told about the budget of the Spring Fling and the price in which Ke$ha’s payout ranges were in shock. Not a single student found Ke$ha to be relevant enough for the range of student activity fees that is being spent on her upcoming performance.

Each year towards the end of the spring semester, a series of events is held for the graduating class. “Senior week is a series of events that provide graduating seniors with an opportunity to end their career at LIU Post in a fun and memorable way,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life.
According to Berthel, Campus Life hosts senior week, with assistance from LIU Promise and the Student Government Association (SGA). Some of these events include a senior cruise, also known as a “booze cruise,” a trip to Dave and Busters, an alumni barbeque, and the senior formal.
Students are involved in the planning of junsenior week, according to Berthel; the SGA has a senior government who are involved in planning the events. “The schedule is set for this year, but we would encourage juniors to get involved early to have their voice heard,” Berthel said. Members from SGA and
the Association for Campus Programming (ACP) said that neither of the clubs were involved in planning the week’s events, and that Campus Life did all the planning.
According to Berthel, this year’s senior formal will have a different twist to it. “We are opening the senior formal to allow seniors to bring guests,” Berthel added. “We heard feedback from a lot of seniors that they wanted to opportunity to bring a guest with them to this event. It is important to us that we listen to the students and as a result, will be allowing them to purchase guest tickets next week.”
“I think the students will really enjoy senior week. It is always a big hit, and I believe it will be a success,” said Nicole Balnis, a junior Psychology major, and treasurer of SGA.
Despite that it is an entire week of events dedicated to the senior class, not all seniors are excited or even attending some of the events. “I’m not that excited, but I will be doing the cruise,” said Victoria Gentil, a senior Business Management major. “I think people would go to something like the cruise where there is free alcohol and can go somewhere to socialize and have fun” Gentil said.
According to Berthel, the senior cruise is the most successful event each year, attracting a large amount of seniors.
Tickets for senior week went on sale March 30, and the events will be running from April 28 to May 2. All seniors should have received an email to their LIU account with the event schedule. Seniors can buy tickets for each individual event, or as a package at a discounted rate of $120. Individual tickets are priced around $15 or more, and can be purchased at the Campus Concierge in Hillwood Commons; students need their LIU ID card with them to buy tickets. The cost of tickets for some of the events, such as Dave and Busters and the senior formal, will be discounted. All proceeds earned from ticket sales are going to the cost of the events.

Every college athletic team governed by the NCAA has to partake in community service, according to the NCAA website and rulebook. This means that in every institution, every athletic team, such as basketball, football, soccer, swimming, lacrosse, baseball, etc. has to do a certain amount of community service hours.
Andreas Lindberg, head coach of the LIU Post men’s soccer team, believes that the mandatory community service hours are worthwhile.
“I think that the compulsory community service that all athletics teams have to do is great; it really keeps the college entwined with locals,” he said. “If it isn’t a local event, it keeps LIU Post on the map, in terms of people knowing and understanding the cause of not only the school, but the athletic program too.”
For example, the men’s soccer team travelled to the Little Flower Center for children and adults, which is based in North Wading, NY. They performed many soccer drills and participated in games with the children on Friday, March 27.
One of the coordinators of the event and a teacher at the school, Regia DeAlmeida, said that the community service hours athletic teams fulfill are great for children in regard to their confidence and overall mood. “Many of the kids love soccer, so to have a team such as the LIU Post men’s soccer team come down and do a series of sessions and games with them is outstanding,” she said.
“The children here at Little Flower haven’t had the best lives so far, so to have the amazing attitude and happiness that the young men at Post brought really goes a long way for the children to enjoy themselves and raise their spirits,” DeAlmeida added.
The community service work of the athletic teams varies. Athletes from the field hockey and football teams partook in a charity ice plunge on March 27 in Oyster Bay, NY, raising money for the Special Olympics. “The Polar Plunge was an excellent event for us to participate in,” said Bryan Collins, the Head Football Coach and Director of Athletics and Recreation.”
“Part of our athletic program’s mission is for our student-athletes to be involved in service to others, and what better way to do this than to commit to another group of athletes,” Collins said. “I’m proud of all of our football and field hockey players, as well as staff members, that contributed to the day and took the plunge for Special Olympics.”
The athletic programs and Coach Collins feel that it is extremely important to utilize these mandatory hours, and get the best out of community service. “It’s been a tremendous effort to serve the community and help in every way that [we] can,” Collins added.

Anthony Tomaino, a senior Marketing major, began his career in art at a very young age. He won his first county art contest in third grade, and since then has been featured in numerous galleries, including the Katonah Art Show and Pace University’s gallery. Once he began college at LIU Post, he transitioned from fine arts to graphic design, and has worked with companies to create and rebrand their logos.
In 2011, Tomaino began his business, Exit Seventy, which started as printing his artwork on clothing and selling it to friends and family. After launching a Kickstarter that was a few hundred dollars short, Tomaino decided to transform this into a business that would help start- ups afford quality logos and marketing. Among those he has designed are Solar Vivant, Lets Entertainment, and Pied Piper Pre-School.
Since the creation of Exit Seventy, strangers around the country have purchased his shirts on Etsy and tattooed his designs on their bodies. He was also on the first board to brand and personally design LIU’s “Student Body Boutique.”
How did you come up with the name Exit Seventy?
Growing up, I spent every summer visiting Montauk. On my long rides to Long Island from Westchester, I associated exit 70 off the LIE with the final stretch of the trip. Since then, I have signed all my artwork as Exit Seventy.
How did you get involved in designing company logos and rebranding them?
I transitioned from painting to digital artwork in my senior year of high school. When I started college, local DJs and musicians began to ask me to draw up their logos and flyers. Word started to spread and I began receiving many friend requests and messages on Facebook from other people that were referred to me. After a few months, I went from working for DJs to creating the face and image of businesses nationwide.
How did you market yourself in this business?
I didn’t plan on doing marketing and logos when I started Exit Seventy, it sort of just happened. I just wanted to make art and share my story with other people. After I decided to take freelancing more seriously, I began to target a different demographic than most people. Instead of going after big jobs with big payouts, I offered cheap services to small companies and local kids who had an idea and no way to put it down on paper.
What inspires you to make the designs for businesses you work for and your company Exit Seventy?
Life! Everyday experiences, memories, old friends, new friends, and even places inspire me every day. When I make designs for other people, I want to express my own feelings as well as theirs in every design. Logos are not just images you see on products and websites; they are also works of art. You have to move the viewer emotionally and make them relate to it themselves in order to portray your message.
Why did you choose to be a marketing major?
I wanted to have a career in business without sacrificing my creativity and artistic abilities. I found an interest in advertising after my sophomore year and never looked back.
What do you plan on doing upon graduation?
As of right now, I work in sales and marketing for a local import/export business. In the future, I would love to focus on marketing and keep growing Exit Seventy.
What do you like to carry in your man purse?
I carry light, having only the necessities such as my wallet and phone. Other than that, I only have a picture of my mom and my sister from when I was growing up tucked away in my wallet. Today’s phones offer you everything else that you need to record and recall the moment.
If you are into traveling, does your traveling inspire your designs for Exit Seventy and rebranding businesses? If so, can you provide an example or two?
Traveling was and is the biggest inspiration behind my art and designs. The name came from traveling to Montauk every summer and the idea of putting my designs on clothing came to me on the eighteen-hour drive to my annual trip to Mardi Gras with my two best friends.
If you went on a quest, what would it be?
My favorite movie of all time is Into the Wild. Ever since I saw the movie I’ve wanted to visit the bus that Christopher McCandless lived in during his time in Alaska. I’m also fascinated by the landscapes and glaciers Alaska has to offer. I think it is every artist’s dream to see the beauty of Mother Nature.
What is your favorite artwork you have created? And what is your favorite business you have rebranded?
My favorite artwork I have created was a piece I did of a pocket watch. I made an agreement with myself not to get up from the computer until the piece was done. I stared at the screen for 22 hours with no extended breaks. A stranger from California stumbled upon it on Instagram through a hashtag and had it tattooed on her forearm. Just knowing someone was that inspired by the design made the effort worth it to me. My favorite business I have worked with is Post’s student-run Student Body Boutique. I designed the logo and promotional flyers for the boutique when it first opened. The boutique gave me the experience to help take Exit Seventy further.
What’s your favorite museum, and why?
I wouldn’t consider this a museum, but there is a gallery in my hometown that features local artists. The gallery was built in an old hat factory that gives it a very industrial feel, which also foreshadows its name (The Hat Factory).
What artist/designer inspires you the most?
I find inspiration in artists such as Andy Warhol, Shepard Fairey, and Banksy. However, my favorite artist is a South African painter named Ryan Hewitt. He only uses odd painting tools and techniques for his portraits to achieve an abstract look that is still recognizable.

Being an intern can assist students with future career plans, from possibly landing a job with that company to realizing that you actually might not want to work in that field. This is why students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of these opportunities; so much so that internships are required for certain majors.
“All students should get hands on experience and apply what they are learning in the classroom to the real world,” said Mikki Rosman, a success coach for LIU Promise. “Internships also provide students with great networking opportunities to meet people in their career field. Oftentimes students are hired for full-time positions after an internship, so the more internships you have, the more options you will have after graduation.”
Abigail Brosnan, a junior Broadcasting major, had the opportunity to intern for “Live! With Kelly and Michael” last fall. Brosnan stated that she found the internship by doing her own research and networking. Once she found it, all she had to do was apply online and attend the interview. She claims that there was a huge turnout and only five people ended up getting the positions, one of these five being Brosnan.
“The interview was one-on-one with a producer from Live, and it went well because I offered my knowledge on the show and conversed about my love for broadcasting; it was really all conversation,” Brosnan said. “For interviews, you have to make it as fluent as possible and be confident.”
Although Brosnan didn’t find this internship with help from Post, there are ways that the university guide students with finding their ideal internship. Rosman stated that if students need help, they can visit Career Success located in the LIU Promise office, second floor of Hillwood Commons.
“We assist students with the internship search process by providing useful websites and tips to search for internships during our internship workshops throughout each semester,” Rosman said. “In addition, we will prepare students to start the application process by reviewing resumes, cover letters, and preparing for interviews.” Also, students can visit JobNet, which is an online job database for students and alumni, where they can find internship postings as well as full-time and part-time job postings. Rosman believes that this is a great resource for students because employers are posting on the site to look specifically for LIU Post students. **
A 2015 Job & Internship Fair will take place in the Tilles Center on April 15 from noon –2:30 p.m. with about 44 employers, from companies like Apple, Verizon, Peace Corps, and many more. “This event is extremely helpful for students because employers are on campus looking to hire LIU Post students for jobs and internships,” Rosman said. But that isn’t its only purpose. Rosman stated that the fair was
also made for the students to have the opportunity to practice their interviewing skills.
“It is very good practice and preparation for students to work on their 30-second elevator speech,” Rosman said. The elevator speech is a quick way to describe yourself, your career goals and what kind of position you are looking for. “In addition, students need to come prepared with their resume to present to employers so this event promotes students to have an updated, completed resume,” Rosman added.
Both Rosman and Brosnan believe that internships are very important while in college. “Working hands on in an internship, and just any professional setting, is the best type of learning experience you can get,” Brosnan said. “I started off slow, feeling it out since this was my first internship, but gradually the work became fluent and my natural strengths were apparent.”
Students who do internships are often able to get academic credit for it. “This is dependent on the student’s major,” Rosman said. “If they are interested in receiving credit, they need to contact their academic department directly.”
Brosnan states that once she contacted her academic department she was able to receive three credits. “I also received an internship advisor who was really great to talk to about my struggles in adapting to my crazy new hours at the internship, and any challenges I faced.”
But if a student’s major does not permit credit for their internship then they have the option to take part of the co-op internship program (EEE), which is a non-credit, pass/fail course where students are required to complete their internship along with a reflective paper, evaluation, and learning goals.
Students who enroll in this program go through four steps in which they are helped with building their resumes and are guided to apply what they learn in class to the real world. “The benefit of completing an internship as a co-op internship is that the employer will be listed on the student’s transcript, Rosman said. “The co-op internship process is handled through Career Success.”

On Wednesday, April 15, at 1 p.m. in The End Zone in Hillwood Commons, guest speaker Karl Schapiro, a survivor of the Holocaust, will share his story with LIU Post students. Schapiro, who is originally from Poland, survived 18 months from 1943-1944 during World War II, by living in a dugout space underneath a farmer’s barn. His family and 16 other Jews shared the space that was only 30-feet-wide and the height of a kitchen table, fighting starvation, diseases, having no sunlight and a single pipe for fresh air.
At the age of 14 in 1948, Schapiro, his parents, and baby sister immigrated to New York. Schapiro didn’t speak English when he arrived to the U.S. He was determined to succeed and his motto has always been “learn and you will know.” He was self-taught by listening to music, reading comics, and working in a candy store. He pushed himself and through hard work and determination, he learned to read and write in English. He attended Brooklyn Tech High School and graduated in the top 10 percent of his class.
After high school, he went on to the Cooper Union for his bachelor’s and to Columbia University for his master’s in civil engineering. He worked for various organizations throughout his career, including AT&T, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Hospital of St. Raphael, and SUNY Downstate Medical Center.
Schapiro worked at Queens College as Director of Campus Facilities until 1996, when he retired. Now, 81-years-old, he speaks at various locations and to anyone who wants to hear his story. However, it was one incident while working at Queens College that made him start speaking openly about his experience. In 1995, a man wanted to advertise a discussion in the school’s newspaper about whether the Holocaust ever existed. Schapiro had never talked about his experience before and said that because of that man wanting to place an ad, he decided to speak up. After Schapiro and other faculty members were interviewed, the Holocaust-denier was never allowed to speak at Queens College again.
Twenty years ago, in 1995, Schapiro described the incident with the Holocaust-denier, saying, “It took one man to wake me up, and one interview for me to come out of the closet.”
Yoni Katz, the LIU Post campus Rabbi and the adviser for the Jewish community Hillel, arranged for Schapiro to come and speak at Post. The Amnesty International club and the Hillel club are sponsoring Schapiro’s lecture. The Hillel club hosts other educational events, holiday celebrations, Shabbat services, community service programs, and social activism programs on campus.
“I am hopeful that the lecture helps Jewish people connect with their faith and connect with their Jewish history, and that they are brought back to their heritage,” Rabbi Katz said. “Karl has an amazingly inspiring story, of how he overcame the challenges of childhood trauma, and became so successful.”
The human rights club, Amnesty International, is also sponsoring the lecture. Rachel Haas, a junior Design major who is a board member of Amnesty International, described their club. “Our goal is to spread awareness of various human rights issues, and to advocate for those lawfully incarcerated for expressing their opinion on government issues in different countries around the world.”
“I am thrilled to get the opportunity to hear such a moving story and to see such an inspirational survivor,” Haas added. “I have heard so much about him and how inspirational his speeches are; to be able to have him come to Post is a privilege.”
The lecture is being held on Yom Hashoa, Holocaust Remembrance day. Yom Hashoa is a day of remembrance of victims and to honor survivors. Schapiro’s speeches are motivational speeches to empower listeners that anyone can live the life they want. He conveys the importance of remembrance from a firsthand eyewitness.

Healthy eating and a balanced diet are important for so many reasons: a general health, good immune system, physical health, and physique. I don’t mean the diet of a super skinny super model or an animal on the cover of Men’s Health, nor do I mean a green tea only- diet, or just apples for each meal of the day, because let’s face it, most of you guys want to have a normal life. Right? However, making a conscious effort not to have Five Guys every day would go a long way, and eating relatively healthy will completely lift your mood!
Being an athlete, as well as living in a house full of athletes, we are all eating pretty well most of the time, and the one food that we love and live off of is eggs! We go through about four or five twelve packs each week. As students, eggs are just a perfect source for our balanced diet; they are cheap, rich in protein, versatile beyond belief, and if you have them with toast or bread, you’ve then made a nutritionally balanced meal with carbs and protein.
However, cooking eggs when you dorm on campus can be a tricky task, I suppose. Especially when you indulge in the campus’ Michelin star food court, Winnick. But instead of eating multiple slices of pizza, or having a waffle with syrup for breakfast every morning, mix it up: throw some lettuce in with the chicken parm, or have a glass of water with every meal.
Of course having the choice of eating or drinking anything you want is a perk that comes along with the western civilization we all live in, but before you have that second or third cookie, stop and think, “no, I have had one,” because the hardest thing when you are looking after your diet is trying not to overindulge when you have the opportunity to.
Although we have spoken about this a few times in other issues over the semester, and many of you gasped and snubbed at the idea of working out, that too helps to keep a healthy lifestyle. It actually provides a justification when you do eat at Five Guys or you do have that extra cookie. If I eat a really unhealthy meal, such as a SmashBurger or a pizza, I just say to myself that I’ll burn it off in the gym.
This lets me have a few treats and unhealthy meals here and there. But, obviously, if you have a good balanced meal, which means having a source of carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, fats, vitamins, fibers and salts, as well as paying the gym a visit every now and again, your body is going to reap the benefits!
One motivation to keep an eye on your diet is to make sure you don’t look like the guys on biggest loser, where ‘letting yourself go’ and not giving any f***s when it comes to your diet can result in severe problems. We don’t all have to look like Victoria’s Secret models, or Captain America, but just a small amount of effort to try and keep the balance of nutrition goes a long way, and as we are all college students, many of us drink on the weekends.
Imagine all the calories from drinking (unless you have a vodka-soda, a zero-calorie alcoholic beverage, which my teammate Jason Lampkin does enjoy, but then again he does belong on the cover of Men’s Health) and then obviously having your slice of pizza next door to Dizzies, then having a bad diet throughout the week. This can all take its toll on the fat content in your body.
So, just don’t have multiple Five Guys in a week, keep hydrated, and make sure you have a balanced diet with every meal. For you guys on campus, Winnick isn’t the best, but it’s not an excuse either. You can definitely get a source of everything that you need!

Saying goodbye is not an easy thing to do, but there comes a time in life when we have to let go. With the end of the semester approaching, seniors find themselves preparing to graduate and leave college behind.
We all have to face that day when we will be standing with our future in our hands, but, as we look ahead, we will also have to say goodbye to our friends, professors, and everyone who was there for us during all those years.
Stephanie Ruhle, a senior Broadcasting major, claims that when she thinks about the future and how she’ll be graduating in a month, she feels herself in panic mode.
“I am so strung out on the fact that I will not be a kid anymore,” Ruhle said. Once you graduate from college, that’s it, it’s time to actually grow up and pursue your life as an adult. Needing to have your life planned out can be very nerve wrecking for students. “It’s the most stressful feeling knowing you don’t have a career lined up,” Ruhle added.
Graduating from college means having to take the big step of pursuing your career. The ideal situation would be to have a perfect job waiting for you as you graduate, but this unfortunately isn’t always the case.
“I have sent out resumes, emails, I’ve gone to so many job fairs. I believe that this whole process is the most stressful thing ever,” Ruhle said. Being a college graduate in today’s job force is tough. Many of the jobs you’re trying to apply to want a good amount of experience and it just makes you wonder: how am I going to get all this experience they want when every job I apply to wants all of these years of experience and nobody is offering jobs?
As a Broadcasting major, although Ruhle appreciates her time at LIU Post, she doesn’t believe she has been going in the best direction for her career.
“I feel that I had to do a lot of job searching on my own and I also feel that other majors get placed in internships,” she said. However, Ruhle is not completely disappointed with what she has accomplished during her years at Post. “I had an amazing experience, with field hockey and friends,” Ruhle said, “but I feel that I could have pushed my academic career a couple more notches.”
Media Arts Professor Jennifer Cusumano said that no matter what major or university, finding a job is the student’s responsibility. She believes that professors are here to encourage, point students in direction, connect them with good internships and show them how to find these, but the effort, the intention, and the motivation has to come from the student.
“University is not job placement, we are not a trade school, so I think the student should absolutely take advantage of their relationship with their professors, pick their brains about jobs in the industry,” Cusumano said.
Other students agree with Ruhle that the thought of graduating can bring on a lot of nervousness as to what the future holds for them.
“It’s bittersweet, meaning I’m happy I’m graduating and it’s good to see my accomplishments,” said Juanita Ramirez, a senior Psychology major, “But I have a bond and love for my friends and this school. You can’t help but imagine what will happen once you graduate or if you’re going to be successful after graduation. Was it all worth it? In a sense.”
Being a senior at this time of the year can be very scary; it’s that time in life when you start to realize that you have to leave a lot of stuff behind and begin your actual life. Graduating is like taking that final leap into adulthood. Even the thought of being a senior next year still completely freaks me out. You start to get those thoughts where you question yourself, wondering if you actually have your life together or if you made the right decisions. But I believe having these doubts is something normal.
With only a month to graduation, seniors should embrace how hard they worked to get to this moment and they should celebrate their achievements. Yes, the future is scary, but graduating is a step in the right direction!

If you’re a dormer or commuter, finding someplace to eat on campus is not a difficult task. With choices ranging from Winnick Center, Subway, Starbucks, Hillwood Cafe, The End Zone, and Post Treat Shoppe, options aren’t limitless, but yet quite diverse.
However, even with these selections, some students find themselves searching for food elsewhere, or bringing in their own meals, to compensate for food variety on campus.
Some students may be wondering what Post has in store for the future? As announced in the article “New Food Additions to Campus” published in The Pioneer on April 1, Aramark is looking to add two new food places on campus: The Bleeker Street Café that will be located in the library and Twisted Taco that will share space with Subway.
Junior Broadcasting major Kaitlin Veygel believes the idea of bringing in new food venues is a step in the right direction, but thinks otherwise about the brands and placements of the venues themselves.
“I think something like a deli would be better,” Veygel said. “Maybe where we can get fresh bagels, and made to order sandwiches from sources like ‘Boar’s Head’ or other reputable meat products.”
Senior Information Technology Management major John DiMartino thinks that it’s a good idea overall because it meets the students’ wish for more food options. It may also help cut some of the lines at other venues, if these are serving food in a quick manner. “Post should consult students about these things much like they do Spring Fling,” Veygel said. “Not everyone like tacos; give us options that everyone, or the majority of the school population is happy with. I suggest bagels!”
Personally, I agree with DiMartino that introducing new food venues is a progressive step in the right direction. However, I also agree with Veygel that the locations of the venues themselves are a little obscure, and could be placed in better areas, with more free space to work with. Other than that, I’m fully behind the idea, and I’m curious to see what direction this is going to take, and how it’s going to be handled among the student body as a whole. I’m anticipating next year to come already.
What do you think about the new venues? Let us know your comments, suggestions, and thoughts at liupostpioneer@gmail.com.

By the late ‘90s, large U.S. businesses began to accept that greenhouse gases must be extracted from the economy, according to an editorial in The Washington Post from Aug. 24 last year. The same editorial states that by 2008, the presidential candidates of both major parties were in favor of the strong national climate strategies. No matter who won the election that year, earnest action seemed certain.
Since the year 2000, land temperature changes are more than 50 percent greater in the United States than ocean temperature changes, according to a 2010 Earth Observatory article, written by Michael Carlowicz. Global Warming is a global issue and is not going to improve on its own. The people must do something.
According to the Live Science website, global warming is defined as the gradual increase in the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere and its oceans. It is believed to permanently change the climate.
There is no denying that there have been some definite climate changes in the past ten years alone. Watching the Discovery channel for 15 minutes can break one’s heart when the polar bears are mentioned. Recently, it has taken longer than usual for the polar waters to fully freeze. This is proof that the temperature of the planet is getting warmer.
Cars are driven everyday, even to locations close enough to walk to. With the exception of the few and far between vehicles that run on electricity, most motor vehicles run on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a finite source that will run out if persistently used at its current rate.
The general public does not seem so concerned by these facts. It was a fad at one point to bring reusable shopping bags to the stores, but now that has passed. Very few people are conscious of their effect on the environment.
It is going to take a lot more than this generation to change anything about the current state of global warming, but we can definitely start.
“Global Warming is definitely a real life issue,” said junior Broadcasting major Kaitlin Veygel. “We are abusing our natural resources without finding alternative means of functioning in the world.”
Not all students at LIU Post feel this way. Senior Broadcasting major William Bruner, for example, does not believe that global warming exists. “How did the dinosaurs die?” he asked. “How did the ice age happen? It is because the earth evolves!” Bruner agrees with the fact that people are polluting the Earth, but said we do not control it.
Global Warming is not an issue that can be swept under the rug. This is affecting our generation, and will affect the generations to come. Unless a policy is not put into immediate action, which directly influences our generation to act against global warming, things will only grow worse for the world as we know it.

An exhibition of great variety is currently on display in the Stein- berg Museum in Hillwood Commons. The annual MFA senior show, consisting of the work of eight students, is called Eight of Fifteen. The exhibit, under direction of Professor and Director of the Art graduate program, Seung Lee, had its reception on Wednesday, April 8 and will run through May 8.
Lee, who said the MFA students have a relatively long leash on what they can do in the show, has worked with the students since early fall to prepare for the showcase. “It’s a part of their thesis,” he said, a required part of their graduate degree. The show itself sees mixed use of media, inspirations, and imagery. “We have students from Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S.,” Lee said, explaining the diversity of the MFA students and the exhibition itself. “It’s their choice what to do for the show.”
The MFA program is 60 credits, focusing more on research than actually going to classes. Lee explained the program is designed in a way that it’s more like a doctorate, where the individual student chooses what to research and learn.
The show consists of works ranging from traditional photo to ce- ramics and patchwork. It’s a dynamic exhibition, and the students were obviously inspired by each other during their progress.
Several, for example, used light as both inspiration and as a part of their work. Miro Kang, one of the students in the show, used clear vinyl stretched on a frame – her idea was to work with light. In earlier works, she has used the same concept in sculptures, with light and shade as the main thought.
“We treat them as artists,” Lee said. “That’s what they are.” He emphasized the program’s approach to students, and that they’re differ- ent from each other. “It’s fun to see them evolve. I follow them from the interview process up until this show,” Lee added.
Lee also uses his contacts as a working artist for the students’ benefits. “I bring some of their smaller pieces to a gallery in Chelsea, where they can get picked up by galleries and go to art fairs,” Lee said. “One student got three solo shows and several group shows within a year after graduation!”
The exhibition in Chelsea is held at Space In Arts New York, or SIA NY. It will run from April 15 – April 22, with the reception on April 16 from 6 p.m. – 8 p.m. The show in the city will have the same overall theme; however, the works in it are not the same. According to Miro Kang, it will be more like an excerpt of the main show in the Steinberg Museum, and will feature smaller works from the artists.

The men’s lacrosse team stole the triumph in a close 12-10 showing as they hosted neighboring rivals New York Institute of Technology on Saturday, April 11.
With both teams filling up the tank from the start, the hosts fell short on fuel at the end of it, and so the ”Battle of Northern Boulevard” was brought back to LIU Post. But it was predicted to be a close race from the start, with both teams undefeated in the East Coast Conference play so far — and close it was.
Both sides switched crown-bearer on and off during the game. As the latter stanza was coming to an end, the Green and Gold sat on the throne, up 11-10. The bears from NYIT marched with all their forces to get the equalizer in the last minutes of play, but the Pioneer defense kept clean. Instead, with only 16 seconds to go, junior attackman Ryan Slane found the Bear cage left empty at the other side of the pitch for his third in the contest, marking a game-high five points with his two helpers counted.
Head Coach John Jez and the squad are traveling to Dowling for another ECC-foe on Saturday, April 18. The game is scheduled for 1 p.m.

On Wednesday, April 8, the women’s lacrosse team knocked off Dowling College in an 11-4 triumph at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
This East Coast Conference showdown was choppy throughout all sixty minutes. Dowling piled up the fouls early on with yellow cards on junior midfielder Allie Merrill and senior attacker Jackie Andersen. However, the Pioneers couldn’t take advantage as they trailed 2-1 in the opening moments of the contest.
It wasn’t long until the hosts found their footing though. After sophomore attacker Stefani Vagelatos had a shot ricochet off the left pole, the Pioneers continued to attack and scored on an Emily Delaney goal, assisted by junior midfielder Kaitlin Gaghan.
LIU Post continued to string tallies together as they went on a four-goal run to carry a 5-2 edge into halftime. Sophomore midfielder Cara Douglas, senior midfielder Jenna Pierro, and Vagelatos all found the back of the net during the stretch. Delaney dished out the final score of the half to Vagelatos with just 8.5 seconds remaining in the first stanza.
Midway through the second half, the Green and Gold would extend their advantage to 8-3, with two goals from Pierro and one from Douglas. Shortly thereafter, the Golden Lions were slapped with their third yellow card of the game.
But, the visitors weren’t done yet, as sophomore attacker Katie Meinecke scored off a helper from Andersen to make the score 8-4, at the 19:49 mark. From there on, it was all LIU; as they went on to score the final three markers. Pierro delivered the knockout punch with 1:09 remaining, scoring her fourth goal of the game on a free-position shot to give the Pioneers an 11-4 victory.
Two-time East Coast Conference goalie of the week, Olivia Kirk, was a force in the cage, making seven saves for LIU Post. The hosts outshot the opposition 29-16 and converted 12-of-14 clears. Pierro won six draw controls and scooped up three ground balls, in addition to her four goals. Delaney and Vagelatos each had three points for the Pioneers.
Head Coach Meghan McNamara and her Pioneer squad traveled down to Washington D.C. on Friday, where they decimated their new ECC foe, the University of the District of Colombia, in a 20-2 blowout at Woodrow Wilson High School.
In the first ever meeting between the two teams, the Pioneers overwhelmed the Firebirds in the first half, holding a commanding 15-1 lead into the break. Vagelatos scored four goals and Pierro recorded three tallies and two helpers in the first 30 minutes of action.
LIU Post continued to strike in the second half, as sophomore attacker Brianna Gibbons and red-shirt freshman attacker Andrea Ferncsik each scored their first collegiate goals. The Green and Gold dominated in the shot count (40-2), as their defenders, led by Bird, Gaghan, and junior Brittany Smith, had the hosts on lockdown for the entire game. Smith and Bird both won six draws and secured three ground balls.
LIU Post will return to the field on Saturday, April 18, when they play host to St. Thomas Aquinas College, in a match-up at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium. McNamara and her team look to remain undefeated in ECC action. Game time is scheduled for noon.

Aly Dzierzynski, a senior Health Science major from Deer Park, handles the catching duties for the LIU Post softball team. Dzierzynski has emerged as a leader for the Pioneers and has been strong with her bat, posting a .291 batting average, in addition to her stellar defense.
Q: As a senior who has been on the team for four years, how have you grown as a leader who the younger players look up to?
A: When I was a freshman, I had really good leaders that helped me develop to the leader I am today. All five of my fellow seniors and I try day in and day out to set good examples for our underclassmen and teach the younger players how to be leaders when they get older, as well.
Q: When did you first start playing softball and what got you interested in it?
A: I was actually a soccer player when I was younger and my family friend convinced me to play softball when I was around 9 or 10-years- old. I also played tee ball, but I got nothing out of it. My dad was my biggest role model in playing sports because he played baseball, so I wanted to be like him.
Q: What’s the strongest asset to your game?
A: I would say my offense. I mean that’s the most exciting part of my game to me and I’ve gotten better as I’ve grown here. Coach Apicella has helped me so much in developing.
Q: How do you look to build on your 8-0 conference record when you take on Molloy in a doubleheader?
A: We go one game at a time and Molloy is one of our favorite games to play because they’re one of our conference rivals. So, we’ll take each game inning by inning, pitch by pitch, and hopefully come out with two wins.
Q: As a catcher, are you always working with the pitchers during games and practices?
A: The pitchers and I have a great relationship. Our pitching coach, Megan Butterworth, and I work day in and day out in the bullpen during practices and we’re always communicating during the game.
Q: What grabbed your interest into becoming a catcher?
A: When I was younger, I was honestly the only one who wasn’t afraid to put the gear on and shut my eyes when I was able to keep them open. I was a little tough one when I was younger so that had a lot to do with me becoming a catcher.
Q: What influenced your decision to attend Post?
A: Meeting with Coach Apicella was probably one of the biggest things that brought me here. I established that I wanted a guy coach and the program record was always something that I was interested in. We win a lot and we have a good reputation, which is something I wanted to contribute to and be a part of.
Q: Have you played any other positions besides catcher?
A: I’ve played first base and I’ve been a designated hitter a couple of times.
Q: What do you find most enjoyable about playing softball?
A: Definitely the team atmosphere is most enjoyable about softball. Being able to be on the field with my best friends and get some wins is what makes it fun.
Q: What’s your biggest goal this season?
A: We like to start with small goals, but of course we want to get to the World Series. Our little goals are finishing in first place in the regular season. Then we want to win the conference tournament, followed by the region, the super regionals, and get back to the World Series again.
Q: Who’s your favorite athlete and why?
A: It’s a mix between David Ortiz and Dustin Pedroia. I’m a die-hard Red Sox fan, which is hard being from Long Island, but Pedroia is just a gritty player day in and day out. He does what he needs to do and leads by example. I also just love to watch David Ortiz hit home runs.
Q: Do you have any plans after graduating?
A: Right now, I am most likely taking a year off and going to nursing school the following year. I’ll also be giving lessons and possibly start coaching.

Coming off a sweep of Molloy College, which pushed their winning streak to 12 games, the softball team returned to action on Saturday, April 11, when they faced off against the Mavericks from Mercy College.
The Mavericks took game one off two by a score of 2-1. The Pioneers lone run came on a fifth-inning homer by sophomore infielder Kayla McCoy. The Mavericks answered that run with one of their own in the bottom half of the sixth inning. In extra innings, the Mavericks dealt the final blow with a walk-off double off the bat of senior first baseman Jackie Couillard who scored sophomore outfielder Janelle Wade.
In the second game, the Pioneers jumped out to an early 1-0 lead thanks to a leadoff triple followed by a sacrifice fly. Like in the first game, Mercy responded. They avoided the shutdown inning and tied the score at one on a home run by senior catcher Liza Ueno.
With the score evened up at one, McCoy put the Green and Gold on top in the third inning with her second round tripper of the afternoon. That was all the offense the Pioneers would need as Isabella Corrao kept the opposition on their heels and guided the team to the 3-2 win. The junior hurler went seven innings while scattering nine hits and striking out five en route to her fourth win of the season.
The Pioneers rounded out their weekend of games on Sunday, April 12, when they took the field against the Golden Lions from Dowling College in their inaugural Make-A-Wish double-header from Brookville, N.Y. Powered by senior catcher Aly Dzierzynski, the Pioneers won both low-scoring affairs to take three out of the four weekend games.
In game one, the Pioneers and Golden Lions found themselves in the middle of a pitchers dual, as neither team got on the board through six and a half innings. Sophomore outfielder Mackenzie Buckley delivered the decisive run in the bottom of the seventh inning, which plated senior outfielder Samantha Miller for the walk-off victory.
Sophomore pitcher Ashley Miller held the Golden Lions to three hits while collecting six punch outs in her seven inning outing. She improved to 9-2 on the season.
In the second game, the Pioneers got their offense going early. After a RBI single by freshman shortstop Jaclyn Hahn, Dzierzynski came to plate and launched her 49 career home run, breaking the record for most round trippers at LIU Post.
Senior hurler Megan Salcido went the distance, striking out four and only allowing one run to earn her fifth win of year. The Pioneers won by a score of 3-1.
Head Coach Jamie Apicella and his squad return to the field today, Wednesday, April 15, when they play host to St. Thomas Aquinas College. First pitch is set for 4 p.m.

On Saturday, April 11, the women’s golf team visited Kutztown University to play its third spring invitational. One of the five members, Shelby Townsend, enjoyed seeing that the sun actually decided to show up for the first time, but said that the wind was unpredictably tricky, nonetheless. That was for those who could play.
“I was out with a shoulder injury so we only had two girls play,” she said, and she wasn’t alone on the side. The Pioneers were forced to play individual rounds as they couldn’t match up with a full team. Only two players made it through the course; junior Hannah Pohalski, who recently marked Pioneer golf history, as young as it may be, shot at 83 for the day, while senior Nokkie Koonvisal totaled 102, according to Townsend.
The hosts, Kutztown University, came out victorious for the sixth straight year on their home ground, only one stroke ahead of the runner- up, according to its athletics website.
Head Coach Tom Kane and the Pioneers will be back in action for their last spring invitational at Easst Stroudsburg, Pa., on April 19-20.

After a scheduling change, the baseball team returned to the diamond on Saturday, April 11, against the Golden Lions from Dowling College. They took the first of a trio of games over the weekend by a score of 7-2 from Brookhaven, N.Y.
The Golden Lions got on the board first in the third inning curtesy of an RBI triple. They tacked on another run in that inning on a double from senior catcher Daniel Parisi. After that small hiccup, sophomore pitcher Jake DeCarli settled down and pitched into the eighth inning without allowing another run. He went 7.2 innings while allowing five hits and striking out four.
Trailing by two runs in the sixth inning, the Pioneer offense went to work. In that inning, freshman first baseman Lou Doria drove in a run to cut the lead in half while senior shortstop Rick Alessi plated another run in that inning to even the score at two. Freshman outfielder Rob Andreoli contributed big-time to the Pioneer efforts with a two-run single to put LIU Post up 4-2.
In the next inning, the Pioneers added to their lead when Doria launched his second home run of the season, making it a 6-2 ball game. In the eighth inning, sophomore catcher Thomas Asbaty drove in another run for good measure, which rounded out the scoring on the afternoon.
Junior pitcher Dillon Burke worked a perfect 1.1 innings while striking out two to put a cap on the game. The Pioneers and Golden Lions faced off again on Sunday, April 12, in a doubleheader, but this time in Brookville, N.Y.
The first game saw the Golden Lions explode offensively for 15 runs. On the other side, the Pioneers only managed one run off of senior pitcher Brenden Butler who tossed seven of scoreless baseballs.
In the nightcap, the Pioneers again found themselves in an early hole. After allowing two runs in the top of the first inning, the Pioneers looked to respond in their half. Sophomore outfielder Kenny Daley led off the inning with a homer to cut the lead in half. Later in the first, red-shirt senior Anthony Brunetti touched home on a hit by sophomore catcher Kyle Fagan to tie the game at two. The Green and Gold tacked on another run to claim a 3-2 lead after six outs.
After the Pioneers and Golden Lions exchanged more runs in the coming innings, both sides found themselves deadlocked at four. On their half of the sixth inning, the Pioneers drove in three runs, which put them in great position to earn the win. After a fielding error loaded the bases, Andreoli scored the go-ahead run on a throwing error by the Golden Lions. After an RBI walk and sacrifice fly, Fagan contributed again, this time with an RBI groundout.
Senior pitcher Connor McCarthy earned his second victory of the season, striking out seven and only allowing two earned runs over a seven-inning span. Head Coach Mike Gaffney and his team return to action on Thursday, April 16, when they welcome Dominican College to Brookville, N.Y. Game time is slated for 3:30 p.m.
