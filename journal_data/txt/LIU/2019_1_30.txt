On Jan. 23, in connection with the men’s and women’s basketball games, all coaches and athletic department staff wore sneakers and suits on the sidelines.
Casey Schermick, director of athletic media relations, described how the choice of footwear was in a partnership with the American Cancer Society and their nationwide event “Suits and Sneakers” week. “They wear sneakers to raise awareness for healthy lifestyles and other aspects that can help prevent cancer,” Schermick said.
In addition to wearing sneakers, the school collected donations during the two basketball games for the American Cancer Society’s cancer research.
Besides from the suits and sneakers week the school takes part in other awareness events. “The school tries to get involved with as much as they can. In October, a lot of the teams dress in pink for breast cancer awareness month and in the spring The East Coast Conference has the mental health awareness week which the spring teams take part in,” Schermick said.

Back in 2010, Electronic Arts (EA) released a video game called, “Skate 3,” the third installment in the world-famous “Skate” series, and while it was a major success, it’s just getting a bit old. Fortunately, a company called Easy Day Studios released a beta for their upcoming game called “Skater XL” on Steam, a multiplayer gaming platform.

It seems like EA is pulling the plug on the series even though non-skaters enjoy the game.
“The ‘Skate’ series was definitely a really good skateboarding game that brought skate- boarding to mass popularity like the ‘Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater’ games did,” Cedric Oliver Sanz, junior astrophysics major, said.
“I’d say it [‘Skate’] filled the void that the Tony Hawk games left when they stopped mak- ing them,” Ryan Kneel-on, senior film major, said. “I definitely got a niche of being able to create your own skate parks though.”
The “Skate” series will always have a special place in my heart; I’ve broken my ankle four times from skateboarding and during each of those injuries when I couldn’t ride my board, “Skate” helped the time pass.
“Skater XL” is nothing like any other skateboarding game I’ve ever played; I thought that the controls used in the “Skate” series were realistic, but in this game, the player has to control the skater’s left leg with their left thumbstick and the right leg with the right thumbstick. When I plugged in my controller, I thought it would be really easy to get a hang for the controls, but I was wrong.
In every other skateboarding video game, the player automatically catches the trick, however in “Skater XL,” they need to do it on their own. Since “Skater XL” makes the player catch their own tricks, they can do tricks like a switch backside 270 degree tailslide, or double hardflip out.
Since the game is still in beta mode, there is only one map, the LA Courthouse. This is a famous skate spot because of the ledges and the stage that professional skateboarder Chris Roberts once switch kickflipped years ago.
For the first week or so after playing the beta, I started to get bored of skating the courthouse because there’s only so much you can do there. Fortunately, I came across some modifications that people have been building for “Skater XL” including custom maps, boards and shoes. I’m actually working on building a map in Blender, a graphic designing software. In the Unity game engine and the map is going to resemble the five-stair handrail outside of Hillwood commons, because I’m too chicken to do anything down it.
There’s no doubt that “Skater XL” has some big shoes to fill as it is the first real skateboarding video game since “Skate 3,” which is now a fossil. While the game so far is looking great, we’ll have to see if it can win players over completely.
“Skater XL” is available on PC through Steam for $20.

In the 2016 election, some students and faculty followed the story of how Donald Trump greatly angered the Washington D.C. foreign policy establishment by criticizing the Iraq War, saying it was a mistake and that the United States should not have invaded a nation to strip it of weapons that it did not have. In December 2018, President Trump announced plans to withdraw troops from the Syrian Civil War, and earlier this year, he was considering scaling back the number of troops in Afghanistan, the sight of America’s longest war.
“One of the main campaign promises Donald Trump made to the American people, and one that most certainly helped him get elected, was that he would end the Republican and Democrat complicit engagement in foreign wars,” said Shawn Welnak, a professor of philosophy. “One would think everyone could get behind this promise, given the manifest failures from the previous administration on this front.”
The goal of America’s foreign policy should be to further the prosperity and safety of the United States, and it seems that our policymakers have no real intentions of prioritizing America’s security or national interests.
When George W. Bush decided to invade Iraq in 2003 and “spread democracy,” thus reneging on his campaign promise to make America a more “humble nation,” he invaded and subsequently destabilized a nation that did not attack us, did not want war with us, and never knew what exactly democracy was. This nation building exercise did not help the United States.
In 2017 and 2018, under the influence of neoconservatives, Donald Trump ordered missile strikes in Syria after Bashar Assad used chemical weapons on his own people. How did this help the United States? It did not.
Article V of the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) treaty says an attack on one nation is an attack on all. If another nation in the NATO alliance is attacked, should the United States really send its young men to fight in defense of another nation?
“America should, in fact, have an ‘America First’ foreign policy. Our nation has focused on so much outside of our country, and there has only been destruction to show for it,” Dianna Gonzalez, a senior English education major, said. “It’s time for us to focus on what’s happening inside the country.”
America cannot afford to be the policeman of the world. We are a constitutional republic; we are not, however, an empire. Our military is too involved in the affairs of other nations, and this leads to other countries resenting the United States, viewing us negatively and as imperialistic. Unless the United States has been directly attacked, or our national interests are at stake, we should remain out of conflict. Perhaps it is time for the United States to return to an “America First” foreign policy.

At the end of the fall semester, most students look forward to a break from schoolwork and a time for relaxation. However, some students prefer to take classes during the winter term to get ahead or to catch up.
During the 2019 winter term, 10 undergraduate courses were offered, according to the LIU website, including Introduction to Philosophy, taught by Shawn Welnak, Sociology of Aging, taught by Eric Lichten, and Introduction to American Politics, taught by Sheldon Rothman. The winter term ran from Jan. 7 to Jan. 18.
Welnak is the assistant professor of philosophy and director of the Institute for Study of Democracy and Liberalism. Because the winter term offers less time to teach the materials, there are challenges in teaching what would normally be a semester’s worth of information in two weeks, he said. “The first challenge is knowing when a course is going to run.” Winter term courses usually have less students. According to Welnak, “across the university they’re small, not a lot of students take winter courses.”
Welnak selected Nietzsche as the topic of discussion for his course. “On the first day of class I just had a copy of the text for everyone. I selected Nietzsche because he’s so playful, ‘Thus Spoke Zarathustra’ is like a novel and has a compelling story.” This allowed for his class of six students to be engaged through the class’ four hour time frame. Because the winter term is so short, “missing one class would be the equivalent of missing two weeks of class,” Welnak said.
Johnny Schishkoff Jr., a sophomore political science major, took Welnak’s class, and found it to be a positive experience. “A four-hour class seemed tough at first; but as it started up, the class became more fun by the day.”

Winter is a wonderful time filled with so many things to enjoy like family, snow, and hot cocoa. While there are many things to cherish about this season, there are also a few things to be weary of. The occurrence of heart attacks and strokes increases by 31 percent during the colder months due to the affect weather has on blood vessels, according to a 2015 study done by Mt. Sinai Hospital.
The science behind this is that in response to falling temperatures, blood vessels such as arteries and veins constrict in an attempt to increase blood pressure and aid in circulation. In order for these vessels to constrict, the heart must use more energy and ultimately work harder. This means the heart demands more oxygen, nutrients and care than normal in colder months.
Studies in 2016 by Consumer Reports validated that for each 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit drop in body temperature, the chance of having a cardiovascular incident increases by two percent.
It’s important to also know that once body temperatures fall below 95 degrees, the heart muscle endures damage, making cardiovascular health extremely important during wintertime.
If heart disease or cardiovascular episodes are common in your family, or if you simply want to preserve your heart as much as possible, there are some simple ways to support it this season. For one, wearing hats and scarves are important since most of the body’s heat is let off at the top of the head. Limiting time outside in cold temperatures can also be highly beneficial. This means coming inside for at least ten minutes for every thirty minutes spent outdoors.
If you want to get more technical, you can speak with your healthcare provider about getting your blood cholesterol and glucose levels checked. These numbers will give you a peek into the condition of your heart and can help gauge how much effort should be put into preserving it, since high levels of these biomarkers are telltale signs that cardiovascular events may be in your future.
As a precaution, regardless of age, gender or background, everyone can benefit from switching to a low fat diet over the winter in an effort to support healthy cholesterol levels. Engaging in light cardiovascular exercise and avoiding highly physically stressful situations like shoveling for extended periods of time or moving heavy things around in the cold, may also help protect the heart.

The Global Institute joined several other university programs under the new School for Professional Studies (SPS), according to an email announcement by Rita Langdon, the new dean of SPS, sent on Nov. 1, 2018.
Former U.S. Congressman Steve Israel joined LIU in the 2017-2018 academic year to lead the Global Institute, with a mission, ac- cording to its website, of connecting our community with global leaders, traveling to foreign countries to network with leaders, and sharing education about national security and foreign policy trends. During the past two years, the Institute has hosted several events, including the Conversation with a Congressman series with guests Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
Within SPS, the Institute will be under the direction of Langdon, who has held many titles on campus including adjunct professor of public relations, executive director of campus operations, strategic partnerships and admissions, and dean of professional education and transfer and graduate enrollment. Dr. Lynne Manouvrier will also be directing the Institute. She is the associate dean of SPS who was formerly director for the center of gifted youth, and an adjunct professor in special education and literacy.
Whether or not Israel will still be involved is in question. Several students who were employed in the Global Institute’s 2018 fellowship program to coordinate events are unsure of what will happen to their promised stipends after they were told these events will be discontinued. Some students working at the Global Institute said they haven’t seen or heard from any of the Institute’s staff, including Israel, since the fall 2018 semester, and they are unsure of what is coming next.
Students in the fellowship were promised $1,000 stipends for 80 hours of work. Work included staffing and coordinating events, putting up flyers, and organizing Congressman Israel’s archives to be put on display.
Angelique D’Alessandro, a senior political science major, journalism minor, and executive editor of The Pioneer, was chosen for a Global Institute fellowship in the fall 2017 semester and began in spring 2018. D’Alessandro aided with several Institute events, including the talks with Vice President Joe Biden, President George W. Bush, and the anti-semitism conference.
“There wasn’t a clear timeline set to complete the hours [required for the fellowship],” D’Alessandro said. Her last event with the institute was the conversation with President Bush in October 2018. Since then, the only news
she has received about the institute was the press release about the creation of the School of Professional Studies. “I haven’t received any information from the source [the Global Institute] about what would be happening with our positions in the future,” she said.
Some of the original five Institute fellowship students were paid before the Institute discontinued its events.
Thomas Pallini (’18), worked as a student ambassador for the Global Institute from March 2017 through his senior year, an “unofficial” and unpaid position in which he helped promote the Institute’s on-campus events. He was later chosen for the fellowship program in 2018, and was paid a stipend after completing 80 hours of work.
Pallini, like D’Alessandro, never worked directly with Israel, rather he communicated and took direction from the staff at the Institute. “I would mainly see him [Israel] at Institute events,” he said.
Both Israel and the university’s public relations office did not respond to the Pioneer’s requests for comment.
Israel is still an active member of the university’s board of trustees, the governing body of Long Island University, according to the university website, despite having taken a salary as chairman of the Institute since 2017. “Members of the Board of Trustees serve as legal fiduciaries of the university and are responsible for overseeing the management of the institution,” the LIU website says.
Israel may be starting a new program at Cornell University, according to two professors at Post and a professor at Cornell University. The details of the program are unclear. Neither Israel nor his staff responded to The Pioneer’s inquiries. Representatives of Cornell did not respond in time for publication.

The Pioneer, LIU Post’s university mascot for many years, is approaching retirement. With the Oct. 3, 2018 announcement that the LIU athletic teams from Post and Brooklyn would merge, many changes are coming, including a new mascot.
Over the winter break, in January 2019, members of selected sports teams were asked which mascot they would prefer, a shark, eagle or falcon. Some student athletes said that they were not asked. Debbie DeJong, director of athletics and recreation, clarified the process of choosing a new mascot. “Our status is that we’re trying to have it very student and alumni driven, and we’re looking at trying to pick a mascot that takes the tradition of both Brooklyn and LIU Post and incorporate them in the new mascot,” she said. Is this happening all because our school is becoming Division I? No, according to DeJong. “It’s from the unification of both of our campuses so that’s what it is and it has nothing to do with the merger of D1 and D2.”
The campus already changed its colors from green and gold to blue and gold during the fall semester 2018. The new mascot, though, had not yet been chosen when the fall semester ended. “I think we want to make sure that we respect both campuses and start to listen to some of our students about what they will get excited about as a mascot and get that integrated in. I’m not sure as to if we have a time frame to finalize this or not,” DeJong said. Yet, she said that the choice of the new mascot will be solely based on what students are excited to see, not what administrators would like.
Sophomore nursing major Nicole Palmer is pleased that there will be a new school mascot. “I like the new mascot change. I think the Pioneers were not the most attractive option as a mascot,” she said. “The new mascot will give a fresh face to LIU.”
Junior business and marketing major at LIU Brooklyn, Eric Casarez, is not fond of the mascot change. “I am definitely against the new mascot change because the blackbird mascot for us at the Brooklyn campus has been more than a mascot for us,” he said. “To have a new mascot that supposedly represents both schools is just not fair for the students that had so much pride in their schools’ mascot and didn’t even get a say in this decision.”
“From what I’ve learned and heard with everything happening, I don’t think anyone knew about the merge between both Post and Brooklyn,” Casarez said. “It was honestly just a shocker to everyone at LIU Brooklyn; from students to faculties to even administration.”

The legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, America’s 26th President, will continue to capture the minds of scholars, historians and researchers due to the addition of the Theodore Roosevelt Institute to the School of Professional Studies. The Institute will provide future generations the ideas and principles necessary to lead by the example of a president held in high regard by both sides of the political aisle.
In a combined effort between LIU, the Theodore Roosevelt Association (TRA), and Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, the Institute promises to provide valuable resources and archives consisting of President Roosevelt’s prolific writings, including journal entries and letters.
The idea for the Institute was presented to the TRA chief executive officer and great-grandson of the former president, Tweed Roosevelt, by former Congressman and head of the Global Institute, Steve Israel, who’s an active member of the TRA and avid supporter of the past president. Together, Israel and Tweed Roosevelt approached university president, Dr. Kimberly Cline, to explore the possibility of housing Roosevelt’s works on campus.
Following their meeting last year, members of the TRA reached out to New York State Assemblyman Charles Lavine to assist them in securing funds for the project’s development.
“We are sincerely grateful to Assemblyman Charles Lavine for his hard work on obtaining $250,000 in New York State funds earmarked for future renovations of Lorber Hall, which will house the Theodore Roosevelt Institute on the historic LIU Post campus,” Gordon Tepper, director of public relations, said.
An expansion to Lorber Hall, which currently houses the School of Professional Accountancy and the Hutton House Lecture Series, will soon occur, and upon completion become the Institute’s official home.
“Having the institute and our Hutton House Lecture Series co-located at Lorber Hall, as part of the School of Professional Studies, will continue to help leverage important synergies and create an innovative learning ecosystem,” Tepper said.
The Institute will provide new topics of discussion, seminars, and unique programs, including lectures from Tweed Roosevelt, who will be the Institute’s chairman.
“Everyone involved is extremely excited. It’s starting as a center, and we’re hoping that we can build it up into a public policy school over time,” Roosevelt said.
People at TRA and LIU are working on bringing in faculty for their first set of students expected this summer or fall.
“We’re going to offer all kinds of stuff for students which should be fun and will enhance the whole educational experience. I’m really looking forward to that,” Roosevelt said.” And of course, I’ll be teaching.”
“We’re planning a major symposium on President Roosevelt and his period for October of this year. It will be a big deal, three-day event. There hasn’t been a major symposium on President Roosevelt for over ten years. We hope to bring in all the major scholars, and all the new younger people,” Roosevelt said.
The campus has already acquired an extensive amount of documents from various sources. For example, the Theodore Roosevelt Association Collection donated by the TRA, is housed in archives and special collections area of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library. Roosevelt is working diligently to gather the research of authors who have written books on President Roosevelt and the early years of the 20th century. He hopes to add their material to an already abundant archive.
“LIU will become a location for people who are researching President Roosevelt at that time,” he said. “President Roosevelt is very popular on both sides of the isle in Washington and we think we could do good things with this center.”
Sagamore Hill, President Roosevelt’s home in Oyster Bay, only 15 minutes from campus, is run by the National Park Service. “Researchers utilize the archives/museum collections at Sagamore Hill frequently for a variety of research needs and to glimpse some intimate details about a well-respected, world renowned historical figure,” Kelly Fuhrmann, the historic site’s superintendent, said. “TR’s writings and political influence provide a solid reference for modern times.”
Assemblyman Lavine first visited Sagamore Hill with his parents in 1955 when he was eight years old. His wife also visited often with her grandfather, an eastern European refugee. “He came to the U.S. when Roosevelt was president, as did my parents, and my great-grandparents,” Lavine said. “President Roosevelt was a fascinating man, and the first of the modern presidents; and to this day, one of the greatest presidents.”
Lavine values the importance of the former president’s historical home on Long Island. He and Israel discussed the significance of President Roosevelt’s place on Long Island years ago, according to Lavine. “We both had an interest in Sagamore Hill and in President Roosevelt.” The politicians also share a passion for the local community, and according to Lavine, LIU plays an important role in the economy of the Gold Coast, making the campus an ideal location for the Institute. “The Theodore Roosevelt Institute, I am sure, will be an education center that will attract people from all over the world, and will also benefit the entire north shore of Long Island…this is a very promising development,” Lavine said. As the institute’s recognition grows, he expects the local economy to grow with it.
Lavine wants students to realize there is much to be learned from President Roosevelt’s presidency and his ability to mediate conflict. “We all now live in a unique time with unique challenges in our history. It’s time we spent more time studying presidential leadership. That is exactly what will be the purpose of the institute,” he said.
Jonathan Albuja, a former student who returned to Post this semester to complete his undergraduate degree in marketing, is looking forward to the opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Institute. “If it’s made available, my thing is to utilize it,” he said. “I’m in school for a reason; I want to use everything they offer. That’s my main thing while I’m here.”

On the second floor of Humanities Hall, in the room formerly occupied by the Writing Center, students can find game design majors busy working in the new digital game design lab. The Writing Center moved, during the fall semester, to room 223, down the hall.
Construction of the new lab began summer 2018, with the lab officially opening at the beginning of the 2018 fall semester. The lab is being called the Game Workshop by professors and students. The workshop isn’t the biggest room on campus, but it has enough space for students to get work done and have fun.
Andrew Wallace, assistant professor of digital game design and development, stated that “the workshop is more of a communal space” for students in his program to hang out and get together after class. “It’s good to have a space to work on projects together,” he said. The lab is mostly used by digital game design majors, but like most places on campus, all students are welcome to come in, learn, and have fun.
“We usually bounce our ideas off each other and help each other out as much as possible,” Brandon Britt, senior digital game design major, said about working in the new lab. “It’s great to have a dedicated room to work in.” Professors Andrew Wallace and Ramiro Corbetto helped design the lab and get everything together.
Two tutors, senior John Mendez and junior Nicholas Buscemi, assist students in the lab. They have been “great assets to have and work with,” Britt said.
Since the lab is relatively new, alongside the computers the students are using a fully- operating virtual reality system. The students use it to create and test newly-made virtual reality games. The lab was buzzing during the fall semester with students working on projects or just having fun playing games. The door is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. during the week.

The women’s basketball team turned over their losing streak on Wednesday, Jan. 23, by beating the University of Bridgeport at home with a score of 80-74.
Music streamed from the gym 40 minutes before the game. With five consecutive losses, the team was in need of a victory. “We were really desperate to win,” junior guard Asia Turner said.
Despite the team’s eagerness, the Pioneers had a rough start. Midway through the first quarter, Bridgeport’s Purple Knights had a 10-0 lead. Bridgeport continued to pressure the Pioneers, and in the middle of the second quarter, they lead by 14 points.
Just when it looked like the Pioneers’ losing streak would continue, they turned the game in their favor. “We became more focused on stopping them from scoring and actually putting the ball in the basket,” junior forward Mikaiya Moore said. With stronger defense and offense, the Pioneers took their first lead of the evening with 42 seconds left in the second quarter (33-31).
“Basketball isn’t a five-minute game. You got to keep on playing and that’s what we did and we managed to come back and take the lead,” Turner said.
It was a close battle in the third quarter, and heading into the fourth, the Pioneers took command with a 58-49 lead. They stuck with their steady pace and, with seven minutes remaining in the game, expanded their lead to 14 points (67-53). The Purple Knights made an effort to come back in the game and reduced the Pioneers’ lead to five points with two minutes remaining, but they never managed to catch up.
Redshirt junior Taylah Hudson made the final score in the last seven seconds of game play, finalizing the score at 80-74. The players were excited to add their first victory in five games to their now 12-6 record. “It felt like it was a championship game,” Moore said. “But now we are on to the next one and we want to win the next game again.”
The Pioneers traveled to Dobbs Ferry to take on Mercy College on Saturday, Jan. 26. The game ended at 69-58 in favor of the Pioneers. The team’s next home game is Saturday, Feb. 2 against Queens College.

The spring semester brings about new adventures and challenges for the musical theatre, arts and music departments. Following the fall 2018 semester’s hectic schedule, the arts students continue to work through a busy spring. Senior tech design major Katherine Keaney outlined the theatre department’s busy schedule.
For the musical theatre department, the performance season has already begun. This past weekend the MFA students performed an original devised show, “Memento Mori.” This performance was directed, casted, and designed by the first and second year graduate students and is a non-realistic portrayal of the seven deadly sins and how they came to be.
With a successful opening night on Friday, Jan. 25, sophomore musical theatre major Emily Shoup assisted the MFA students with technical elements and stage managing.
“Opening night is always great. Adrenaline is high and you can’t wait to see the whole performance come together,” Shoup said.
The next performance of the season is the musical “Wild Party” directed by external director Scott Ebersold. The musical, set in the roaring 1920s, shows elaborate parties, prohibition and a twist that will keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The show occupies the main stage Feb. 22–23 and Feb. 28 – Mar. 2 @ 7:30 p.m. with matinee performances at 3 p.m. on Feb. 24 and Mar. 3.
There are a number of upcoming performances this semester, with both the freshman and seniors taking center stage. The Honors Thesis Weekend Festival 2019 is a showcase of the graduating musical theatre honors students, Elise Raemakers, Lauren Gissentanna, Aaron Cooper, Griffin Lockette, Jenna Gadille, Megan Breit, and Julia Vaughn. The performance will consist of four short undergraduate thesis productions, on Mar 8-9 at 7:30 p.m. and a matinee performance Mar. 10 at 3.p.m.
For the freshman, this will be the first time many of them grace the stage for their freshman year showcase, taking place between April 11 to April 14. This is a time for the class of 2022 to really place their stamp on Post Theatre Company (PTC).
The seniors will face a different type of final performance as a members of PTC. The senior showcase in New York City is an opportunity for theatre students to get their faces known by possible talent scouts. Tickets for all theatre performances can be purchased via tix55.com/ptc700 or directly from the box office prior to performance.
Along with the theatre department’s busy schedule, the dance company has their show in the latter half of the semester. The PCDC spring dance concert will take place from April 26-28 at 8.p.m. It is a chance for the dance students to display both their dance talents and choreography skills alongside guest performers.
This spring semester also sees the art departments undergraduate and graduate students’ continued showings of work in the S.A.L gallery, on the first floor of the library. The S.A.L gallery is a space for collective or individual gallery showings for the students in the department. For many of the artists, this is the first solo show they will participate in. The reception for each show takes place on Wednesday between 5 p.m. and 8.p.m, where visitors can interact with the artists and hear what they have to say about their work.
As for the freshman arts foundation students, they are continuing to broaden their horizons with a number of gallery trips planned. The first is a trip to the Whitney Museum of American Arts on Feb 20. Freshman graphics design major Lauren Beyer finds the trips with her classmates creatively inspiring and a lot of fun. “It is very inspiring to look at professional artists and incorporating their work into your own,” Beyer said.
There is plenty of activity in the arts departments this semester, with the students looking forward to staying busy and producing work they can be proud of.

The battle for free speech in schools, both public and private, has been a long and arduous one. There are student reporters across the country, from high schools, public colleges and private universities, who have to fight in order to have their voices heard.
In the case of Hazelwood School District vs. Kuhlmeier (1988), high school students from Hazelwood East High School in Missouri sued their principal after he censored a special section from the student newspaper that included articles on teen pregnancy and the impact of divorce on students. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which decided that it “a high school-sponsored newspaper produced as part of a class,” the principal could censor the stories where he demonstrated a reasonable educational justification and where their censorship was viewpoint neutral. Many states have anti-censorship New Voices laws to benefit student journalists.
As college journalists, the student reporters and editors on the Pioneer support press freedom for all student journalists. We too face challenges in our reporting, including delayed responses that lead to missed deadlines and incomplete stories, non-tenured professors scared to speak openly for fear of losing their jobs, student workers being advised not to speak, and budget cuts so we are forced to print fewer copies with fewer pages.
Yet even with these challenges, our staff perseveres. The Pioneer will continue to be a source of honestly and fairly reported news on campus for students and staff to depend on and will proudly support the press freedom of our peers.
For anyone interested in supporting The Pioneer and student journalists nationwide, we encourage to share the hashtag #StudentPressFreedom on social media.

Dr. Heather Parrott was named the chairperson of the new Department of Social Sciences during the fall 2018 semester. The newly-formed department combines history, political science, international studies, sociology, anthropology, and economics. Parrott has replaced the former chairpeople of these departments Jeanie Attie, Amy Freedman, Eric Lichten, and Panos Mourdokoutas.
As chairperson, Parrott is an advocate for the different programs in the social sciences department. “I have had to quickly learn each of the programs within the new department – the progression of classes, what courses are required for the major, what courses can be substituted, when courses are best scheduled for different types of students, who typically teaches each course, the relationship between undergraduate and graduate degrees, how internships work,” Parrott said.
Parrott also has goals for the future of the department. “My biggest goals are to figure out ways to grow and promote all of the programs under the social science umbrella. Certainly the skills and knowledge learned in our courses are applicable to any future career, including careers in business, law, social work, nursing, veterinary care, criminal justice, and teaching,” Parrott said.
Parrott, who is an associate professor of sociology, studies inequality on many fronts such as racial, ethnic, gender, and class inequality. “Even students can help address the problem of inequality, she said. “I think the biggest things that students can do to address inequality are to learn more about social issues. Take classes, keep up on current events, read news articles from diverse sources, and become informed voters.”
One of Dr. Parrott’s greatest achievements has been starting the Long Island Applied Research Center (LI-ARC). The LI-ARC’s goal has been to “more effectively mobilize the expertise of local faculty to assist Long Island nonprofit agencies and, wherever possible, use these connections to enhance student learning,” according to Parrot.
Unfortunately, many of the faculty that were affiliated with the LI-ARC have recently been let go, but despite the difficulties surrounding the cuts, the LI-ARC is still actively involved in community-based research. Those at the LI-ARC are doing a collaborative study with the Safe Center LI to explore the extent that their services reduce the effects of trauma.
Between her work as a professor, a new department chair, and a researcher, Parrott will continue to do a lot for the LIU community.
