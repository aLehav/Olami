Post Theater Company’s (PTC) production of Shakespeare’s “The Comedy of Errors” is a play of twists and turns. It explores marriage, duty, theft, and the strife that occurs through the mistaken identities of two sets of estranged twins. Opening night for this all-female slapstick comedy is Friday, Oct. 6, with the curtain rising at 7:30 p.m. in the Little Theater.
One week from opening, the actors portrayed vivacious energy in rehearsal. Through the complicated prose of Shakespeare, these actors bring a simplistic air to the language, allowing the comedy to tell the story through the carefully crafted expression and movement. The cast displays a captivatingly uid dynamic that appears natural. For the most part, it is evident that they are having fun.
Director Ryan Quinn, who comes from outside of the university, guides his cast from scene to scene, allowing them to come across the “magic” moments through their own discovery. “It’s a combination of getting to know your cast and what they find funny, and compressing each moment and allowing the lines to play themselves out with clarity,” Quinn said.
“The Comedy of Errors” is a comedy that plays on extremity. Over-the-top reactions emphasize the messages being conveyed by the characters. “We use dance and music to show the extremity of expression when words can’t say it all,” Quinn said.
Stage manager and junior technical theater major, Katherine Keaney, whose responsibilities include communicating between the actors and technical crews, said the costuming and set design play large roles in bringing the characters to life. “The set is like Tim Burton meets New Orleans, and the costumes really exemplify that too,” Keaney said.
The 14-member cast of “The Comedy of Errors” has been hard at work through four weeks of rehearsal. Isabelle Rutens, junior musical theater major, leads one half of the dynamic twin duo as the traditionally male role of Antipholus of Syracuse. “I tried to approach Antipholus not as a woman playing a man, but rather as a human playing another human,” Rutens said. Her character is an outsider to the town of Ephesus where in the play is set, and for that reason, she serves as the main link between the audience and the action happening in Ephesus. “It’s been really exciting and challenging to see how I can keep throwing the ball in the air [to my castmates] and how I can get the audience engaged,” she added.
PTC is offering multiple chances to see the production, with seven show dates. You can catch the performances the first week on Friday, Oct. 6 & Saturday, Oct. 7 at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 8 at 3 p.m. The following week’s performances will be from Thursday, Oct. 12 through Saturday, Oct. 14 at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 15 at 3 p.m.
General admission is $15, seniors are $12, and student tickets are $10. A season subscription that provides unlimited attendance to all mainstage PTC productions is $100. Tickets can be purchased at the box office in the Little Theater, or online at tix55.com/ptc700. Contact the box office at 516-299-2356 for more details.

Safety in school, home and work environments is an important key to many people in their day to day life. LIU Post has said goodbye to last director Paul Rapess and replaced him with Michael Fevola, a retired police lieutenant from the NYPD.
Fevola has served the NYPD for twenty years and retired in 2006. Fevola is not a new face on campus; he previously worked as the director of Audio Visual for LIU’s Information Technology department from August 2006 until his recent promotion to head of public safety.
Fevola plans to ensure the standards of campus safety for students. “We are always looking for [new] ways and ideas to make the campus even safer,” Fevola said.
The Public Safety team consists of 22 full-time officers stationed all over campus. Students noticed the increase in public safety activity on campus.
“I [noticed] they have been getting stricter with parking and on campus driving regulations,” Karina Cuba, senior arts major, said. Having more officers posted on campus allows for quicker response time if any incidents were to occur on campus.
As the Director of public safety, Fevola has many responsibilities. “The overall safety and well being of the entire campus community, day in and day out, is my paramount concern,” Fevola said.
The Public Safety Office, located on the east side of campus past the residence halls, is open 24/7 throughout school the year. “Someone is always in the office to help or just to listen to students concerns,” Fevola said. “If I am here and not in a meeting, I will make myself personally available to students who may have serious concerns or issues,” he continued. To reach the public safety office call 516-299-2222.

Every member of the 2017 graduating class of the medical imaging program was able to get a job post-graduation, some even had multiple job offers. However, this is nothing new. In the past four to five years, there has been a 100 percent employment rate for the graduating students from this program. They now work at facilities including Zwanger-Pesiri Radiology, Orlin & Cohen Orthopedic Group, and local hospitals such as St. Joseph’s, Winthrop, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, and North Shore University Hospital. Some students have since gone back to school, and some into higher administrative positions.
The faculty in this program hold a high standard for their students to follow, which plays a role in their overall success. They are strict with each student, requiring no absences from clinical training and absolutely no cell phones. The focus and professionalism in their job setting ensures that students are not only prepared for exams, but also for clinical connections within their occupation.
“Faculty of the medical imaging program take a lot of pride in the fact that our students do very well in their clinical rotations,” Director of the Radiologic Technology Program, Suzanne Thomas said.
While students have patient care classes in a SIM lab located in Pell Hall, each student is able to rotate clinical sites. There are eight clinical affiliates, and every semester there is a rotation, so students get experience at four different locations.
The application process is extensive. Students begin their specific program in their junior and senior years. The program is limited to current Post students. They must have already taken prerequisite classes such as anatomy and physiology, as well as have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.5.
Students hoping to apply for the program should plan ahead.
A secondary application to the program can be requested beginning in November of their sophomore year. The Health Occupations Aptitude Exam, an interview with the program’s admissions committee, and six hours of observation in a radiological facility are also required.
Beginning this semester, there were 70 applicants, with only 25 chosen each year. This year the program is also affiliated with CityMD. A future affiliation with Mount Sinai is still up for discussion. The strong reputation of this program will remain to outshine others with its 100 percent job rate, and ensure the students are prepared for life after Post.

The department of communications and film and the LIU Post chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists will host a resumé and interviewing workshop on Thursday, Oct. 5 at 12:30 p.m. Speakers from two media companies will help students strengthen their resumés and skills for internships and job interviews.
These speakers will give students first-hand accounts of what big companies look for in new hires. One of the speakers, Maryann Skinner, the assistant managing editor of Newsday, is in charge of hiring both interns and new employees for the newspaper.
“Having the opportunity to get first hand advice from the people who hire for these companies is a great opportunity for someone like myself who has only had one job,” Nick Matina, a broadcasting major, said. Ashley Damis, also a broadcasting major, agreed. “I always have problems with my resumé. I don’t know what to add in or leave out, so to have someone go step by step with me would be very helpful. It’s going be an interesting and informative event to go check out,” Damis said.
The workshop will be held in Humanities Hall, room 108, and is open to students of all years and majors. Lunch will be served.

Almost 100 students and administrators participated in the 2017 Long Island Heart Walk at Jones Beach on Sept. 17. The fundraising event, sponsored by the American Heart Association, consisted of fundraising efforts leading up to the walk as well as a walk along the Jones Beach boardwalk.
The students joined over 4,000 participants this year, raising a total of $338,846, according to the AHA. LIU Post raised $6,383.
“It was a great experience because there were so many people of all ages who were coming together for this important cause,” Adam Silverstein, a sophomore social work major, said. “Everyone there was clearly very compassionate towards people with heart conditions and wanted to show their support for them. It was very inspiring and uplifting to see.”
Silverstein was happy that LIU participated in the heart walk. “I think it is very important for our university to show our support for causes like these,” Silverstein said. “It was especially important for us because it was an opportunity to show our support for John Cammarata, the father of a current LIU Post student who recently passed away due to a heart condition.”
Many athletic teams attended the event to show their support. Sophomore marketing major Frank Catania, who plays lacrosse, relished the experience. “The heart walk was a great experience and I’m glad we were able to take part in it, considering one of our teammates who was poised for a productive season was out the entire season with myocarditis,” Catania said. “This was something that hit home for us. As a team we raised money for a great cause that will be used to save many lives. Overall it was a great experience for all of us.”
In addition to the men’s lacrosse team the men’s wrestling team, the women’s softball team, cheerleading squad, Alpha Xi Delta sorority, Delta Zeta sorority, Sigma Delta Tau sorority, Theta Chi fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and campus RA’s also attended.

After many professors demanded the return of the New York Times newspapers to campus, Michael Berthel, dean of students, has allocated money in order to provide 100 print copies Monday through Thursday.
One of the professors who reached out was Scott Carlin, associate professor of Geography. Carlin used to use the textbook, “Half the Sky” by New York Times columnists Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl Wudunn, for his class. This semester, instead of requiring his students to buy the textbook, he had them read the New York Times, as he was unaware of the changes being made to the New York Times subscription. The service change was a disruption to Carlin and his students.
“The world we’re living in right now, there’s much difficulty trying to figure out what’s real and what’s not real. It’s helpful for students to sit down and take a look at what the New York Times is offering…it’s a resource for students,” said Carlin. “It’s not the gospel…it’s a basic resource for students.”
The New York Times will continue to be available for students and professors to use. Copies will be available in the library Monday through Thursday.

Hello again LIU! Some of us might already be thinking about our schedules for next semester and how many credits we need to graduate. If you add them up and see that you’re short a class or two and if you have the freedom to choose a free elective, you might want to consider some of the fun, stress free, stress relieving classes that are being offered in the Pratt Recreation Center throughout the year!
Nana Koch, a professor and Chairperson in the Health, Physical Education and movement department informed me during my last interview with her that “there are so many classes available to students that they don’t know about”. I was intrigued so she enlightened me, revealing that “The department has formulated so many wonderful and fun classes that allow students to not only strengthen their muscles and body, but teach them lifestyle changes and patterns that can be extremely beneficial to them.” Some of the courses Dr.Koch is referring to are pilates, badminton, tennis, yoga, tness and conditioning and others!
You can check LIU’s course offerings at https://webapps.liu.edu/courseschedules/schedules. aspx?campus=P beginning Monday, Oct. 9 to see which classes are being offered. Simply type in the search bar ‘PE’ and hit the search button! Now you may at first turn your nose up to some of the courses, not wanting to have to physically participate, but before you make up your mind, make sure you know the facts.
Pilates is a highly overlooked activity. According to the Mayo Clinic, a world renowned center that offers not only health services, but also conducts trials that aim to educate the public on all things health. Pilates is a fantastic way to strengthen your core. In addition, it’s easy on joints, helpful for managing back pain, and does wonders for exibility. Aside from these great surface benefits, pilates also helps you connect your mind and body. It does this by yielding on fine motor muscles, such as the ones that control posture and dexterity, which in turn creates a positive muscle memory between the activated muscle and brain. Because of this, it also boosts brain power!
Tennis, as you know, is a great workout. Muscle training, cardiovascular endurance, peer interaction, these are the immediate perks of joining the course. Enrolling in either the beginners tennis course or the intermediate tennis course will allow you to acquire skills that can be translated to all aspects of your life. Instead of the whole “I don’t know, what do you wanna do?” chat that most of us go through with our friends, how about suggesting going to play a game of tennis so you can whoop their butts- I mean graciously display your newly acquired skills in a game at the local town courts!
Now I don’t think I need to remind you about the many benefits of yoga, but I’m going to anyway so you can see how vital this class could be in your stress management protocol that will inevitably have to go into effect near midterms or finals. As uncovered by the American College of Osteopathic Medicine, yoga has the ‘magical’ ability to shift the body’s energy towards self healing. By this I mean that it calms down the many raging thoughts inside our heads that tend to drive us a little crazy sometimes. The energy that it takes to make these thoughts then goes into healing small muscle tears, high pulse rates, anxiety, anxiousness and attention dilemmas. A study done by Duke University in North Carolina concluded that people who engage in yoga have a significantly higher concentration of serotonin in the body. Serotonin is a chemical messenger whose nickname is “the happy hormone” because of its ability to reverse a bad mood and regulate sleeping patterns.
Now that you know about some of the courses being offered, look into the courses, read them over and see if you have the availability to spend your three credits on a course that’s aimed at only benefiting you, your body and your lifestyle!

The College Democrats Club has started a petition to come to campus, hoping to expand and become a place for all people interested in politics. Jared Rosenthal, an 18-year-old freshman, and co-founder of the club says he felt that, “since there is already a Republican Club on campus, we should bring the Democrat Club to Post.” Rosenthal has experience in the political field and is currently working on his fourth political campaign. He even had the opportunity to work on the Clinton presidential campaign this past year, inspiring his love for politics even more.
To students who may have interest in the club, but are not democrats, Rosenthal ensures his club is, “open to all views, you don’t have to be a Democrat to join.” He wants the organization to be inclusive and open to all people so that all students on campus can learn more about politics.
The main goal of the club is to instill a knowledge of local and national politics into all of its members. Rosenthal wants to use College Democrats Club to, “teach people about politics, equality, and get people registered to vote.” He believes that it is imperative to get students engaged in politics, as many are not aware of the political workings around them. College is a time to expand in knowledge, and Rosenthal hopes his club can do just that for interested students.
To find out more information about the College Democrats Club, contact Jared Rosenthal at
jared.rosenthal2@my.liu.edu, or call (516) 946-4536.

Gabrielle Nau, a senior health science major, with a minor in health care administration, is the president of Delta Zeta sorority.
Q. Where are you from?
A. Kings Park, Long Island, New York.
Q. Do you commute or do you live on campus?
A. I commute
Q. What does Delta Zeta stand for? How did it start and what separates it from other sororities on campus?
A. Delta Zeta is one of the newer sororities on campus. We started here in the spring of 2015 and since then have [grown] tremendously. When I was a freshman I wasn’t sure what exactly what I wanted to do or how I wanted to get involved, but the Greek advisor, Joe Veronia contacted me and asked if I was interested in starting a sorority here. I was definitely hesitant because of all the negative connotations that come along with Greek life, but to be very honest, Delta Zeta proves all of those “views” wrong. Delta Zeta nationally holds its women to high ideals, and more specifically, our motto is “Do More. Care More. Be More.” For the past two years, we have won the title at the Greek Life Banquet for the Highest Sorority GPA, and we are extremely proud of it! Along with academics, we are extremely passionate about philanthropy, and Delta Zeta opens up so many opportunities for community service.
Q. How has Delta Zeta opened so many opportunities? And what are they?
A. We hold Mr. DZ, which is a big philanthropy event and all pro ts go to the Starkey Hearing foundation.
Q. When is sorority recruitment?
A. Sorority recruitment was the week of September 25.
Q. How does recruitment week work?
A. During recruitment week, the girls who signed up attended nightly gatherings of sisters and [meet] all four PanHellenic sororities on campus. They learned about our philanthropy and sisterhood.
Q. How was preparation for it?
A. We had been preparing for months for this and were ready to welcome new women to our sisterhood!

As the leaves change color and the temperature starts to cool, nothing screams autumn like pumpkins and apples. Eating an apple a day just got easier thanks to Jericho Cider Mill.
Fresh baked treats that feel home baked is within reach on Route 106. The Jericho Cider Mill is a small store that has been in business for over 150 years. The place is filled with an assortment of apples and apple related products. The cider mill gets its apples from one of the major apple producing areas in the country, the Hudson Valley.
The Cider Mill is a small, old fashioned house that is filled with apple goods and fall decor. Because of minimal parking, visitors should try to avoid peak hours, between 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. Visitors can park on the side of Route 106.
Jericho Cider Mill sells a variety of ciders, pies, baked goods, and gourmet apples. The establishment is known for their apple crumb pies, apple cider donuts, cider, and candy apples.
Senior broadcasting major, Marvi Sajid purchased an apple pie from Jericho Cider Mill last week. Visiting the cider mill is a tradition for the Sajid family. “Every year my family and I go to Jericho Cider Mill to get pies. It’s a tradition we have, and I love the pies,” Sajid said.
Senior broadcasting major, Taylor Hill loves fresh apple pie. Her favorite thing to accompany a warm apple pie slice is french vanilla ice cream scooped on top. “Even though I have a busy schedule, I would love to go one day,” Hill said.
Jericho Cider Mill is open 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. Monday to Sunday.

If you are looking for a better understanding of why people act the way they do and why you do things a certain way, reading the right books can help.
Although reading doesn’t seem to be a “go to” hobby for some people, there are a few books that I want to recommend. For some of us, taking time to read might seem unappealing. Yet, whether you hate it or love it, these three books will give you so much knowledge that they are worth the effort.
The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself, by Michael A. Singer, teaches us that our thoughts and the voice we have in our head is not who we are. We have to learn to let the negative thoughts pass through our minds instead of giving in or trying to block them out. “Being able to acknowledge is knowing the difference between yourself and your personal self,” Singer explains. “We are constantly trying to hold it all together. If you really want to see why you do things, then don’t do them and see what happens.”
Another book I’d like to recommend is Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck. brings to our attention that there are two mindsets with which we can face every day situations, fixed or growth mindsets. A person who has a fixed mindset avoids challenges, which leads to giving up, not putting in the effort, not taking criticism well and this leads to no success and negativity. But, someone with a growth mindset takes on challenges as an opportunity to learn, putting in every bit of effort, and appreciating criticism. This leads to great success and a healthy mindset. “The view you adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life,” Dweck writes.
The Four Agreements, by Don Miguel Ruiz, can be a guide to your life. Ruiz gives four agreements that if followed correctly and consistently can better your life.
Agreement one is to be impeccable with your word, second is not to take anything personally, third is not to make assumptions and the fourth is to always do your best. They might seem simple at first glance, but once you apply them to your life, you can see just how hard it might be to follow them. This book will teach you how to apply them effectively. “It is when we lose control that we repress the emotions, not when we are in control,”Ruiz states..
Applying the lessons from each of these books has made such a difference in my life. I am now able to understand that I can control whether or not I choose to give into doubts and worries. I choose to acknowledge them but I try everyday to let them pass by.
Acknowledging that I have both fixed and growth mindsets and working on how to change the fixed views and strengthen the growth views is a goal that I am working hard at. Also applying the four agreements in my life has positively affected how I face obstacles. These lessons require hard work and dedication, but are worth every step.

With the first month of school completed, students are finally adapting to their new routine, with the help of the resident assistants. RAs are peer leaders who supervise one floor of a residence hall.
According to Ashley John, Interim Director of Campus Life, the RA position is unique and sought-out position. This year, 34 RAs are supervising Post Hall, Riggs Hall, Brookville Hall, Queens Hall, Kings Hall, South Residence Complex and Nassau Hall, which has re-opened this semester due to the larger number of incoming freshmen.

“We look for natural student leaders who embody what it means to be a Pioneer. This includes students who are creative, influential, compassionate and committed to the values of the university. Our RAs play a huge part in making the residence halls feel as a home away from home for our residential students,” John said. RAs serve as a beacon among their peers inside and outside of the residence halls, she added.
“This year my current RA is really putting herself out there by having an updated wheel on her door so residents would know where or what she is doing which is deemed to be helpful,” said Taylor Hill, a senior broadcasting major.
“Being an orientation leader this past summer was an immensely rewarding experience. At first, the incoming freshmen were reluctant to participate in activities. But after just two days you could see the connections they made with each other. Now, I am excited and proud to be their RA and watch their growth as they transition into college, Emily Buonocore, a senior public relations major, said. This is Buonocore’s first time being an RA.
Olivia Kavanaugh, a junior majoring in art education with an art history minor, has been an RA for two years. “This is my second year as an RA and also my second year being a freshmen RA. I feel like that had made all the difference to me, not only do I make sure they are on the right track to being a respectable resident in the future but when they tell you that you made their freshman year great, that is what makes all the late nights and floor meetings worth it,” she said.
This year’s RA’s have created Instagram pages for each dorm to keep in touch with their residents.
Editors Note: Two RA’s have informed the Pioneer that they cannot speak publicly about their position as an RA.

On Wednesday, Sept. 27 the Student Art League (SAL) Gallery located on the first floor of the library presented artwork by second year MFA in fine arts student, Laura Sweeney.
Sweeney displayed seventeen of her sketched and screen printed works. The theme of her showcase was pop culture icons. The exhibition featured portraits of characters from television shows “Twin Peaks” and “Stranger Things,” and K-Pop artists such as Kris Wu. “It’s just stuff I’m into,” Sweeney said.
Sweeney has had two other showcases in the SAL Gallery before; her first was similar to last week’s theme, where it featured pop culture. Her second showcase featured traditional charcoal figure drawings. Usually gravitating towards drawing and oil paintings, Sweeney is experimenting in screen printing. “I kind of just try to challenge myself and experiment with different mediums,” she said.
On Thursday, Oct. 19, the MFA students will have a show in Bushwick featuring screen print. Sweeney will be showing two of her own pieces.
After her graduate degree, Sweeney plans to become a professor, either on campus or in the CUNY system. Sweeney will also continue to do illustration.

A busted bank robbery lands mentally disabled Nick Nikas (Benny Safdie) in Rikers Island, a New York prison known for housing notorious criminals, and it is up to his brother, Connie Nikas (Robert Pattinson) to help break him out. 
“Good Time” did not receive considerable advertisement on television, however; it is available on the Fandango app or website. The title “Good Time” is a bit deceiving. Though the movie’s plot did not permit a good time for the Nikas brothers, the directors Benny and Josh Safdie ensured one for the audience. One moment where Connie sneaks into the ICU of a hospital in Queens due to an injury Nick succumbed to in Rikers built up suspense and made me think-can Connie get Nick out? The expectations I had for Pattinson were low. Having only seen his work in “Twilight,” I expected similar character traits. For example, his fear of emotions which took away from the movie.
However, Edward Cullen is nothing like Connie Nikas. Nikas is boisterous while Cullen is dull to the point where even Pattinson got sick of the role. Safdie’s portrayal of a disabled adult reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio’s role as Arnie Grape in “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape” due to the character’s semblance. When I was walking out of the movie, I took a moment to reflect on what I saw, the chapped lips and muffed voice of Safdie stressed to the audience that Nikas is deaf.
In addition, Pattinson’s transformation from an Englishman to a New Yorker with his accent and diction throughout the film was impressive. The mood of the film was set in the opening credits as the directors used 80’s electronic music to emphasize the action-packed pacing throughout the movie along with the film’s dark palette. In this case, it highlighted the circumstances that occurred after the robbery. If you haven’t seen “Good Time,” prepare for an emotional journey of defining what brotherhood truly is.
I must say that I am very impressed by the performance of Safdie and Pattinson, there are not many negative things I can say about “Good Time,” as its high points drastically outweigh the lows. “Good Time,” is currently playing at the Plaza Cinema & Media Arts Center in Patchogue, New York.

The once underestimated and overlooked sports department of WCWP radio station has retired from being called those names as it has grown more than four times its original size in the past four months. This ambitious group was able to grow rapidly all because of a shift of focus. Sports Director and recent alumnus Thomas Scavetta, is leading the group by keeping a clear cut vision in mind. “I wanted to make the department the best it could be. I wanted to widen our horizon and take us to the next level,” Scavetta said. “It was important to give everyone an opportunity so members could gain experience,” he added. The more experience one has the more overall success the sports department would have. “My biggest goal is to get better and better each day, I want everyone to succeed,” Scavetta said.
After holding the position of sports director for a short five months, Scavetta put an executive board in place to create a better flow during the sports seasons. The assistant sports director position is now held by senior broadcasting major Greg Vavrinec. Vavrinec is the sports department’s second in command and helps run weekly meetings. He also organizes interviews with athletes and makes sure that all content is complete and ready to go for every broadcast.
Head Engineer is sophomore Griffin Ward, who works behind the scenes controlling the volume, in-cues, out-cues, and promos. Head of Production is sophomore Nick Mattina, who creates scripts, liners, and promos. Other students outside the executive board help drive each broadcast forward. Bryan Marbach, head producer of football, is responsible for production work and focuses on timing for pre-games. The sports department has benefitted from better organization and efficiency since implementing the executive board. “The goal is not to be a big department but a department of quality,” Scavetta said.
Looking ahead, the WCWP sports department is working towards covering a wider variety of sports on campus. “We represent every athlete at this university,” Scavetta explained. The sports department currently covers football, basketball, baseball, softball, and women’s and men’s lacrosse. Scavetta hopes to add soccer, rugby, and field hockey this year. Tryouts for covering these sports will be held Friday, October 6 from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. in Studio Four at WCWP.
The new sports crew is excited for homecoming weekend, which kickoffs Friday, October 13. Both current members of the WCWP sports department and alumni showcase their passion, skills, and love for the game of football at homecoming. “Homecoming is going to be fun as the Pioneers go against Southern Connecticut University,” Scavetta said. Alumnus Je Kroll will call the Saturday, Oct. 14 football game while alumnus Neil Marks will provide color commentator. “Jeff has been at WCWP for 46 years. I don’t know where the sports department would be without Je ,” Scavetta said. The much anticipated homecoming weekend will give members of the sports department access to alumni who have worked in professional sports. They will have the opportunity to watch and learn how those who came before them work while calling a live broadcast.
The WCWP sports department gives students hands on experience that will prepare them for the real world. Scavetta recommends not to “be afraid to go the extra mile” because “it does pay off .” He also says to, “treat this like it’s your job. Joining the sports department gives you an edge in the field.” Working with the sports department at WCWP radio one gets what they put into it and as long as you work hard and never get complacent you will see growth. The sports department is a young department in terms of experience however, that does not take away from their progression and tenacity. Vavrinec said. “The sports department might be the best it could ever be with the amount of new and young members that have joined in the last year and have made major contributions. I’m so excited what the year holds for the department.” The WCWP sports department has not only grown as a team but has challenged members to grow individually. Mattina dove in head first during his freshman year. “In this department, we strive for the best and nothing else. I learned that as soon as I joined in my first semester of freshman year. I worked my tail off every single day and made my way up through the sports department one by one, from highlight cutter, to voicing our weekly segment which updates the scores and news around LIU Post, the Pioneer Report, to reading a scoreboard update and then getting the chance to call my first game in my second semester,” Mattina said. The WCWP sports department operates like a sports team. Everyone has different positions but all of those positions are important and serve a different purpose. While playing the positions, students learn the importance of teamwork.
To join the WCWP sports department, contact Thomas.scavetta@my.liu.edu or Dan.cox@my.liu.edu. Check out their social media on Instagram @WCWPSports and Snapchat @WCWPSports! “Last year was a rebuilding year for us, this year it’s time to cash in!” Scavetta said.

The football team is ranked 24th overall in the NCAA Division II conference. Led by Head Coach Bryan Collins, the team is currently 3-1. “Coach Collins is a very passionate coach and cares about his players very much,” Pioneers quarterback Yianni Gavalas said. “He is a great teacher and has been a successful coach in this league for many years. Learning from him and his coaching staff has been a privilege.”
In their second game of the season on Sept. 9, the Pioneers traveled to West Haven, Connecticut to take on the University of New Haven Chargers. It was a back and forth game the entire day between the Pioneers and the Chargers. With the Pioneers trailing 27-14 with 12:26 left to play in the third quarter, Gavalas took matters into his own hands by throwing consecutive touchdown passes to Amir Crenshaw and Deon Mash to give the Pioneers a 28-27 lead. Just minutes later, the Chargers regained the lead, 34-28, with just over eight minutes to play. Once again, the Pioneers turned to their quarterback to come up clutch. With 4:07 remaining, Gavalas threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to give the Pioneers a 35-34 lead. Still trailing with three seconds left in the game, the Chargers lined up for a game-winning 27-yard field goal. The Pioneers’ luck continued in that game as New Haven kicker Danny Stock, missed the game winning field goal and the Pioneers hung on to win 35-34. “Out of the games I have called thus far, the game against New Haven was the one that stands out,” WCWP football broadcaster Greg Vavrinec said. “The game was so back and forth that no team had momentum for the whole game and the ending of the game was an ending you dream of for a broadcaster. Pioneers winning 35-34 with 3 seconds left, and the other misses the game-winning field goal as time expires to lose. That atmosphere was so intense and all the attention is on you to deliver the best call of that moment. It was a crazy game that I won’t ever forget.”
The next week, the Pioneers returned home as the ninth ranked team to battle Stonehill College. “It’s a great feeling to be on a team that is recognized to be of that caliber,” Gavalas said. “However, rankings do not mean much to us. We just want to do the best we can each week during practice to help us win more games.” The Pioneers offense continued to click in this game as they quickly jumped out to a 13-2 lead at the end of the first quarter. The second quarter, however, got off to a rocky start for the Pioneers as they surrendered the lead and trailed 16-13. Things quickly turned around for the Pioneers and took a 34-16 lead into halftime. The second half was more of the same as the Pioneers tacked on another 17 points while holding the Stonehill offense scoreless the entire half. The final score was 51-16 for the Pioneers. Following the game, Gavalas was named the Northeast 10 Conference Offensive Player of the Week for the second week in a row. “I am thankful for the player of the week awards I have received, but those awards are a product of my teammates’ hard work and stellar play,” Gavalas said. “The offensive line, coaching staff and wide receivers have done nothing but set me up for success. The defense has also been playing very well, allowing our offense more opportunities to put points on the board.”
On Sept. 23, the team traveled up to Woltham, Massachusetts to take on Bentley University. Going into this game, both Bentley and LIU were undefeated. This game was an ugly one from the start for the Pioneers. The offense struggled to get anything going and the defense was nowhere to be seen. Luckily for the Pioneers, they scored a late first half touchdown to bring the deficit down to 19-7 with eight minutes remaining in the first half. Bentley answered with a touchdown of their own and took a 26-7 lead into the locker room at halftime. In the second half, a pair of Pioneer touchdowns brought LIU to within five points, but that was the closest the team came to tying this game up. A huge fourth quarter for Bentley propelled them to a 40-21 win over the Pioneers.
Despite the loss to Bentley, the Pioneers have had a successful season so far. “I think the key to the team’s success this year is our ability to be a solid football team in all three phases of the game (offense, defense and special teams),” Gavalas said. “The offensive line has played tremendous and so has the defense, which are keys to any successful football team.” The Pioneers play Assumption College, Southern Connecticut State University, American International College, Pace University, Merrimack College, and Saint Anselm College to finish the regular season before, hopefully, heading to the NCAA playoffs.

“My goodness!” That was the reaction of Meghan McNamara, the Women’s Lacrosse Coach after she received word that she would be honored in the Women’s Professional Lacrosse League Legends’ Celebration and Legends Game at US Lacrosse Headquarters in Sparks, Md.
It’s a deserving honor for someone who first picked up the game because “her sister needed someone to play with.”
From family games to being honored for winning four National Championships at the University of Maryland, leaving with an 83-4 record, McNamara truly took to lacrosse and has helped “a really, really, fun sport” grow.
As the head coach, McNamara has stats that NFL legendary coach Bill Belichick would envy. There have been 40 consecutive wins, back-to-back championships, three consecutive “Coach of the Year” honors, and something that even Belichick can’t match; a perfect season. (Interestingly, the Holy Cross college women’s lacrosse coach is Amanda Belichick, Bill’s daughter.)
For McNamara, coaching has changed from her college days, as McNamara puts a greater emphasis on running, but the values and concepts have remained the same. Beyond McNamara’s win-loss record, her players provide a more important recommendation.
To Alyssa Mallery, a sophomore on the team, “Coach McNamara is always there when you need her. She is a selfless woman who you can always go to for advice, whether it is for school, lacrosse or anything.” It should come as no surprise that if she wasn’t involved in the world of lacrosse, McNamara believes she might likely have been a teacher.
Coaching, McNamara said, is “crazy,” and she provided a long list of her duties that included long hours in the office, recruiting, preparing for practice, lifting, studying opponents, and making sure players are doing well academically. It is no surprise that one of her secrets to success is “preparation, it’s all about prep.”
For all her preparation, McNamara’s legendary designation caught her off-guard. “No, not in a million years, not ever in my lifetime I never thought I’d be considered that, so it is a fantastic honor. It is a surprise just to be amongst all these amazing coaches and women that really are true trailblazers for our sport. It’s neat, it’s really neat.”
The upcoming debut of the Women’s Professional Lacrosse League is built on a foundation established by trailblazers like Meghan McNamara.

Players and coaches aren’t the only thing new to the athletic department this fall. Debbie DeJong has taken over as athletic director, replacing Bryan Collins, who remains the head football coach.
As Athletic Director, DeJong oversees 25 sports teams and everything that falls underneath them. She leads the coaching staff to make sure that athletes are being successful in the classroom as well as socially. DeJong prides herself on making and reaching goals for the athletic department. “When we meet a goal, we raise the bar up again to meet our next goal,” she said.
DeJong has plans for Post. She believes that the athletic program is successful and will continue to be successful, but she is not one to settle. She wants to have more speakers come in, more leadership forums, more involvement in the national student athlete advisory committee, and more community service involvement as an athletic program. She wants to get all student athletes to be more involved in a larger landscape than just on the field. “She has already had a speaker come and talk to the athletes about sexual assault and it’s only been a month of school,” Rob Andreoli, a senior baseball player, said. “So I think this is what our athletic program needs and I think she’s doing a good job so far.”
DeJong was a Division 1 college softball player at Rutgers University. She started coaching after college, and continued to do on and off until 2013. She came to Post that year as the associate athletic director for compliance, until her promotion this year. “I think to come in and become the boss of your peers is a hard thing to do, but she’s doing a great job at it this far. She has a different vision, she is pro student athlete and she has made that very clear,” Deirdre Moore, head women’s basketball coach, said.
One thing DeJong wants is to make sure she helps coaches mentor and teach young students. Moore said DeJong is definitely on her way to achieving that goal. “She came in on a Friday morning and talked one on one with my team about how to be a leader and how to be successful as a unit.” Being able to have a direct impact on the students and knowing she can make positive affect on them is DeJong’s favorite part of her new job.
DeJong said she always wanted to be an AD because when she coached she wanted to be able to talk to administrators who knew what each day was like as a coach. She wants to be an administrator who knows and understands that specific lifestyle it takes to coach.
DeJong has a vision for Post and will do anything in her power to make sure that vision becomes reality. “We will grow bigger and better,” she said.

It’s that time of the year again! Wear your green and yellow and bring your school spirit as the Pioneers will square off against Southern Connecticut State University on October 14 at 1 p.m. for the annual Homecoming football game.
The Pioneers, coming off a 40-21 loss to Bentley University and a matchup on September 30 against Assumption College, stand third place in the 2017 Northeast 10 standings with a 3-1 record. They outscored their opponents by an average of 21.6 points per game in their first three wins against Virginia Union, New Haven, and Stonehill.
Quarterback Yianni Gavalas has been on fire all season, throwing for an impressive 1,374 yards and 15 touchdowns. Wide Receiver, Michael Richardson has corralled 356 of those yards and scored six touchdowns of his own. Running Back, Malik Pierre leads the Pioneers in rushing, with 231 yards (4.9 yards per carry) and four touchdowns. The Pioneers defense also deserves a nod for being a crucial factor in their 3-1 start allowing 25.7 points per game. Pioneers Tight End, Andrew Ris said he and his teammates treat Homecoming like every other game—go out, play hard, and win for the hometown crowd.
“This game is no different for us as a team,” Ris admitted. “Every week our goal is to beat the next team up in our schedule. The atmosphere at [Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium] may be different, but our goals never change.”
The Pioneers will look to carry on their Homecoming winning streak this season. They have won five straight Homecoming games since 2012. Last season, the Pioneers took out Saint Anselm with ease, 63-20, on the big day.
“We are expecting the crowd to be into the game, enjoying the atmosphere and supporting us in our fight against Southern Connecticut,” Ris said.
Gather your friends and family and enjoy a memorable day at the stadium in support of the Pioneers!
