With rumors of major changes coming to LIU Post within the next six months, the semester’s first Town Hall meeting, held by the Student Government Association (SGA), was a necessity, both to dispel and clarify all the speculations.
The Town Hall meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 13, was an open forum, which allowed Dr. Jackie Nealon, the university’s new chief of Staff; Dr. Abby Van Vlerah, the new dean of Students; and Alerie Tirsch, the director of Student Life, to answer questions from attending students about a wide range of topics, such as campus life and the rumored changes.
There have already been some big changes since the new President, Dr. Kimberly R. Cline, took charge of LIU on July 1, including the opening of a new student run clothing store and the restructuring of certain administrative areas of the school, including Admissions and Academic Advisement.
On the subject of rumors, Nealon quickly squashed the question that a Shake Shack was coming to the campus.
There has also been an overwhelming worry around campus that tuition would be raised, which could mean added financial strain for many students. However, Nealon stated that Cline has promised no more than a two percent increase in tuition until 2020, compared to the average of over six percent.
The Apple Store that is rumored to be opening in Hillwood is not going to be an Apple store. However, it will be a tech store that is licensed to sell Apple products, a rare affiliation that only a few academic institutions can claim to have, stated Nealon.
This tech store is also going to have a tech support bar, something students can take advantage of if they are having any kind
of computer problems. The Student Art Gallery is will be possibly used as a shared space, perhaps with another student run business similar to the clothing store. The Center for Student Information (CSI) is going to be used for another purpose, possibly another student run business, but no plans are set in stone as yet, which means no more printing in CSI, something that could raise concern among commuter students who use CSI for their printing needs.
“I often use the printing facility in CSI as a quick option as I am passing through Hillwood on my way to class. I hope that there will be an alternative printing facility that is convenient,” said Andreas Olsen, a graduate Political Science major and commuter student, who attended the Town Hall meeting.
With the Gaming Room already moved to the upstairs study lounge, there was worry among students that
the Recreational room, also located upstairs in Hillwood, would be made into something else, therefore diminishing the amount of study space in Hillwood. However, Nealon assured students that there are plans to revamp the Recreational room, making it a better facility for students.
“There is already limited space for commuters to study during common hour; allocating space for this seems essential for a commuter school, ” said Kristina Renberg, a senior Public Relations major and commuter student.
An interesting discussion of proposed student run businesses for Hillwood was also held. One hundred percent of the profits from these businesses, according to Nealon, will go straight back to the students, with 50 percent going to scholarships and 50 percent to the school’s capital fund, which will be spent on other improvements for students.
For the students who live on campus, a hot topic at the Town Hall meeting was the Winnick Dining Hall, and the major question was, “Will the food change and get any better?” Van Vlerah said, “Paul Carroll, the director of operations for Aramark FoodSservices, is willing to work with students to cater to their needs. We encourage students to take to resources like the SGA food committee to help communicate what it is they want.”
Brianna Pisano, a freshman and member of SGA, who attended the meeting stated, “Dr. Nealon often reassured the students of their worries by explaining that they want to expand access to study resources and entertainment all around campus rather than just in Hillwood.”
The Town Hall meeting, which was held in the Cinema during common hour, didn’t have a large attendance. However, for students it was an interesting and necessary meeting that began to bring clarification on a range of topics.

St. Jude’s Children Hospital is holding a fundraising walk for cancer and other diseases in children on Nov. 23, 2013. The walk will be located at Bethpage Ballpark in Central Islip, New York. Check-in time is 9 a.m.
What some may not know is that on Nov. 23, 2013, LIU Post will participate in the walk. The team is made up of three LIU Post students. It was created as a social responsibility project for the students’ marketing class. Garrett Fatone, Michael Lupola, and Jean Pierre Rousseau make up Team Post. Rousseau is the team captain.
The team’s goal is to raise a grand total of $1,500. The team has raised $135 so far. “We are looking to gain more than just the on campus and local community support,” said Fatone, a senior Business Administration major.
To gain support they have posted links and posts on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to gain momentum from prospective donors. The team asks prospective supporters to log on to the St. Jude Walk website, click on the Follow the Find a Participant to Support link, and under Team Name type “Team Post.” It will bring supporters directly to the team’s page and show how much money they have raised so far compared to their goal. There is also a button to submit a donation on the page.
Also on the St. Jude Walk website, is the Find a Location and Register link, which will allow users to find specific dates, times, and locations, in addition to specific dollar amounts of goals compared to how much has been raised.
As of Nov. 18, the Long Island walk has raised $77,038, which is 96 percent of its goal for this year. Users can also show find a list of top fundraisers and top teams. Lupola is on the list for top fundraisers.
St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital is one of the largest children’s hospitals and has provided tremendous research for cancer in children. Since it is a hospital specifically for pediatrics, its full focus can be on diseases that affect children. The hospital, which was founded by Danny Thomas in 1962, aims to change the lives of people all across the world—not just the patients it holds.
The mission statement is: “The mission of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. Consistent with the vision of our founder Danny Thomas, no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family’s ability to pay.”
There is still time to join Team Post, supporters who do not wish to be a part of the team, can either donate money through the Team Post page on the St. Jude website or by attending the walk on Nov. 23 as a spectator in support.
“I plan on going to the walk with my little brother,” stated Alex Ochoa, a junior Accounting major. For students who are unable to join in on the walk, but want to do some good in the community, Circle K is a club at LIU Post, which is dedicated to helping out in the community and doing volunteer work.

Most people, during their college careers, have had at least one history lesson. They have learned about countries, wars and significant monuments. But the students here at LIU Post are not just learning about history – they are walking on it. Believe it or not there are several buildings and areas on the LIU Post campus that have historical significance.
The campus consists of three Gold Coast Estates. The first building, the Winnick House, was a part of Post Cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post’s estate. The Winnick House today houses the Admissions Office, Study Abroad Office, and some of the new Success Coach offices, as well. The second estate of Post, the Fine Arts Building, belonged to famous Wall Street broker Edward F. Hutton, who moved to the estate after he and Marjorie Post divorced. Finally, the third part of the campus known as Lorber Hall was owned by William E. Hutton, the nephew of Edward F. Hutton.
Lorber Hall, also known as the School of Accountancy, serves students for several majors, including Accountancy, Criminal Justice and Business. These buildings that once served as homes now serve as classroom buildings for students and offices for staff and facuty.
In 1947, Marjorie Post put her estate up for sale and Long Island University became interested in purchasing the property and transforming it into a small liberal arts college. The transaction was made official in 1951, and the school named the campus C.W. Post in 1954. The campus was named after Marjorie Post’s father, Charles William Post, the founder of the Post Cereal Company.
The history of this campus is not just information complied into a pamphlet, and should be known to the study body, as well as to the community surrounding the university. Kenneth Mensing, LIU Post Campus Historian, said, “The reason why I feel it is important to remember Post history is because so many great people lived here and their accomplishments in life were quite amazing.” Some students feel that learning about Post history would be interesting and would help them feel more connected to the school.
Marjorie Merriweather Post, for example, developed her father’s cereal company into a large food corporation, in addition to becoming the first woman to sit on the board of directors of a company at a time when woman were not known to do that. She became a board member of General Foods in 1937. Although she had owned the company for several years prior, she was told she could not become a board member. Despite the adversity, she fought against tradition and earned herself a spot on the board.
Each day students walk across campus without knowing they are standing in the same spot where many great people stood before. The beautiful trees and gardens that made up the former estate are now a community arboretum, located by the Winnick House, and can be appreciated by our campus community and the greater public.
Of course, with history there also comes rumors. Mensing said, “There is one rumor that I have tried to change for years and it never seems to really go away. It’s about the former rose arbor. [The brick arches south of the formal gardens] have for years been called The Seven Gates of Hell by more students that I can count.” Depending on whom you ask, you may get a different story behind the name. Some students say that as freshman they were told that the rose arbor, haunted the school with ghosts at night, but of course those were just rumors to try and scare the new class. Other stories include that Marjorie Post would haunt The Seven Gates of Hell every night at midnight, and that she would haunt the Fine Arts building at night as well.
Many may not know that the rose arbor has been a destination for many newlyweds. Mensing said that, “Many brides over the years have had their wedding photos taken on the steps of the arbor, and the first commencement for transfer students was held on the steps of the arbor in 1958.”
Now as students and faculty walk the paths and hallways of Post they will know that they are a part of history.

The success of the first International Fashion Show from the 2013 spring semester led to the planning of an international education week. Nov. 11 to 15, the international clubs celebrated International Education Week. The eventful week is co-hosted by International Student Service (ISS); Korea Student Association (KSA); Indo-American club; Conversations, Helping, And, Teaching, Students (C.H.A.T.S); Taiwan Student Association (TSA); and the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA). All these clubs and associations worked to put together cultural and festive events to improve awareness of the diversity of cultures on our campus.
“The International Education Week is an opportunity to celebrate the benefit of the international education and exchange worldwide. A series of events in this week brings various cultures to the campus and improve the awareness and appreciation of LIU Post community to the diversity of the world. Also, it also showcases the contribution and achievement of international students during their study at LIU Post,” said Leslie Bai, director of Asian Student Academic Support.
The series of events started on Monday, Nov. 11 with the International Student Union (ISU) basketball game at Pratt center. There were two games, ISU v. Vikings and CSSA v. the combined efforts of KSA and TSA. About 40 students from different countries played together, and many students came to cheer on their country’s players.
The Vikings won the first game. The score was tied in the first half, but the Vikings played really well in the second half. CSSA won their matchup by five points. The game was really close until the last minute.
ISS hosted the opening celebration for International Education Week on Tuesday November 12 at the Tilles Center. They had a dinner and Japanese students performed a dance called “Toran bushi.” The dance demonstrates the move of fishermen. “I was really nervous but I was proud of performing Japanese traditional dance to people,” said Saki Matsumoto, junior Public Relation major said.
They presented awards to the winners of the international student writing competition presented by ISS.
Wednesday, Nov.13, CHATS had a forum “My Childhood Photograph” in Humanities Hall. International students shared their childhood photographs and stories with other students. C.H.A.T.S is a program that unites American students and international students as partners so the two can learn about each other’s cultures and become friends. This gives the internationals students the opportunity to improve and practice their English and gives American students a chance to learn about different cultures.
“You don’t need to go abroad, and spend money. You could be in the culture by talking to international students. The most important thing is having fun!” said Lu Zhao, school counselor of ISS, advisor of C.H.A.T.S.
Later that night students participated in the event “Explore the World Through Our Halls.” Resident Assistants (RAs) prepared food, dance, and presentations about the country that they represented.
“I love this event because you really get an opportunity to learn about different countries and cultures. It also teaches everyone about different cultures in a fun interactive way,” said Stephanie Drew, B.M. in Music Education and an RA of Brookville hall. “I only wish that I had more time to spend with international students to learn more about each of their cultures.” she added.
On Friday, Nov. 15, as part of the last day of the International Educational Week, there was an International Friendship Festival at Top of Commons at 8 p.m. There were many different foods from the world and some traditional games. About 60 international students participated and shared food from China, Japan, Norway, and Korea and more. After dinner, students shared the traditional games that they played when they were young.
“We would like to invite more people to become representatives of their home country so that we can truly diversify our community and allow international and American students to exchange culture and tradition more effectively,” said Stephanie Trieu, a sophomore Health Science major and president of ISU.
There will be an International Cultural Week during the spring 2014 semester.

-There are so many health clubs and so little time to make a decision about which one is the right match. Let’s face it – gym memberships are expensive, and price is a very important deciding factor. With gyms such as New York Sports Club, Equinox, Synergy and Planet Fitness nearby, it is hard to make a decision about which gym to join. Access to a health club is becoming somewhat of a necessity for many college students looking to stay in shape, or ward off the curse of the Freshman 15. However, there is another option for students right on campus.
LIU Post students are able to stay in shape and partake in all of the exercise they like at the campus athletic facility: the Pratt Center. Pratt is equipped with many amenities students need to stay in shape. Within the Pratt Center are basketball, volleyball, and badminton courts, a jogging track and a large pool for students to swim in.
“I go to the Pratt Center everyday to work out,” said Gyu Jin Hwang, a junior Public Relations major at LIU Post. “I think the Pratt is great and clean and not too crowded. For students who may not have the means to sign up for a gym membership, or who aren’t able to get off of campus frequently, the Pratt Center is a free gym that LIU Post students can utilize during its operating hours.” The Pratt Center is open Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m.–midnight; Fridays 7 a.m.–9 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m.–9 p.m.
LIU Post students who would rather work out off of campus have an endless amount of opportunities when choosing a gym. How do students choose which health club to join, especially when membership rates tend to be very high? Nearby health facilities include: Life Time Athletic at 350 Robbins Ln, Syosset, Core Fitness Studios, Inc. 74 Cedar Swamp Rd., Glen Cove; and XSport Fitness at 630 Old Country Rd., Garden City.
For students who may not have the funds to sign up for a full-year membership, Life Time Fitness in Syosset allows members the opportunity to pay for their membership on a monthly basis. If new members are not satisfied with their experience, they are offered a 14-day money back guarantee. XSport Fitness gives members the opportunity to sign up at a low rate of $9.95 per month, instead of paying a yearly membership. Members are given a 30-day money back guarantee, and for every member they refer, they are provided with 20 XSport points per referral, as stated on xsportfitness.com. These reward points can be used, by members, to add complementary months to their memberships, or other products or services of their choice.
A student who prefers not to use health club facilities at all, may find that a home workout is something that can be just as effective as working out in a gym. “I really don’t work out at the Pratt Center, but I know many people that do,” said
Tina Lo, a senior Psychology major. “I always feel overwhelmed by the machinery and the people when
I go to the gym. I’d much rather work out at home, or take a jog outside.” Jogging along a track or the park, or working out to a fitness tape are some ways people choose to get in shape without being within the confines of a health facility.
As winter slowly approaches, students can partake in winter sports such as ice hockey or ice skating to stay in shape. Being conscious of healthy habits, such as eating right and exercising is important to many college students. On a daily basis, students are surrounded by foods and snacks, and sometimes it may become difficult to make healthful choices. With
a free, on-campus health facility, nearby health clubs, and many ways to simply work out at home, students are certainly capable of staying in shape during the school year.

By the time we reach college, we all have experienced at least one embarrassing moment that we will never ever forget. For LIU Post students, some of those memories are still just as lively as when they occurred. LIU Post students confessed their most embarrassing moments, while reflecting on them toward who they are today.
Jillian Giuffre, a sophomore Electronic Media major, said, “[I] fell down the steps the first day of high school because I was scared I was going to be late to class.” When asked why that was embarrassing to her, Giuffre stated, “I made myself look like a fool in front of everyone.”
Sophomore Acting major Kristen Camos said that her most embarrassing moment involved another person. “An acquaintance was waving at me and I waved back, but they were really waving to someone behind me.” Camos expressed her reasoning for being embarrassed, “When you think that one person is somebody else, when they’re not, things can get awkward and embarrassing really quickly.”
Some embarrassing memories can last a couple years. Amanda Gaimaro, a sophomore Speech Pathology major, found herself reflecting on one moment that in particular. Gaimaro stated, “In 9th grade, I sat through the wrong math class for almost the entire period. It was so awkward.” When asked how that made her feel, sitting through an entire class that turned out to be wrong, Gaimaro said, “I was so embarrassed. The teacher asked the class who she didn’t call out loud for attendance. So I responded to her, saying that she didn’t call me. After that, the teacher simply told me that I was in the wrong class.”
Gaimaro expressed, “It’s a funny moment in my life, but I don’t think about it that often though. Still, it was one of the first memories that came to mind,” she laughed.
Although there are regular embarrassments, and even those that stick around with you for a little while, other embarrassing moments can last a lifetime.
Jake Scotto, a junior Electronic Media Broadcast major, still remembers the day he played the DJ at a Sweet Sixteen party. “This was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. I was doing a one-man Sweet Sixteen. This means that I was the only DJ there, and my shift was the whole night. All the pressure was on me when I was calling out all the ladies and gentlemen to pay attention to the candle ceremony.”
“Then, it happened,” Scotto stated. “The room was filled with 125 to 135 people. I was calling this one girl’s name Kristen all night, and I don’t know what happened. When I was calling her up to the candles, I called her Stephanie instead of Kristen, and everyone looked at me, like I was an idiot. I will never forget it,” he said.
When asked if Scotto still reflects on this embarrassment, he confesses, “Yes, absolutely. Whenever someone asks me if I have an embarrassing moment that makes me not sleep at night, I always go back to that same night. It gives me butterflies in my stomach every time, but you live and you learn,” Scotto expressed.
Giuffre, Camos, Gaimaro, and Scotto, are only few students with embarrassing moments. However, all of them have something in common: their embarrassing moments have molded them into the people they are today.

For thousands of years, one question has plagued mankind: Does God exist? As we all know, there is no simple way to answer this question because nobody has ever seen Him, or Her for that matter. On Thursday night, Nov. 12, Brothers and Sisters in Christ (BASIC) and the Debate Team co-sponsored an event that highlighted the longstanding conflict between atheism and theism. The Hillwood Lecture Hall was packed with members of the LIU Post family, as well as those in the surrounding area.
Dr. Amy Karofsky, an associate professor of Philosophy at Hofstra University, advocated for the belief that there is no God, while Anthony Uvenio, an elder at Church on the Sound in Stony Brook, N.Y., defended the belief that God does in fact exist, specifically from a Christian perspective. Both sides seemed to be very well prepared for the debate, not only because of their studies, but also because of their personal experiences.
Karofsky, who has been atheistic for over thirty years and who has also published work that seeks to dispel the theistic worldview, used a couple of different ideas to support her position. Karofsky referred to the idea that our solar system was so tiny in comparison to rest of the Universe, several times. She also stated that the probability of our world coming into existence was nearly impossible and that alone should make us grateful. Uvenio’s argument also included some points about the design of the universe and about how the universe itself can be used as evidence for the existence of God.
Whenever you hold a discussion about God’s existence, it is inevitable that the next question that will pop up is “If God created us, who created God?” During the cross-examination portion of the event, Karofsky presented this exact question to Uvenio and he responded simply by saying that God is eternal. I am going to try to explain this as briefly as possible. In order for something to be eternal, it must remain constant. This also means that it has no beginning and no end, so in Uvenio’s worldview God has no creator. Karofsky still seemed to have an issue with this, stating that if we as intelligent beings had an intelligent creator, than that creator would need to have been created as well.
Another major topic that was discussed was morality. Morality is one of those things that cannot necessarily be explained. It seems as if we are all born with some sort of moral compass, or in other words, a conscience. During the debate, Uvenio mentioned that in his worldview, the Bible was his standard of morality. Karofsky rebutted this by stating that there are plenty of things in the Bible that we would argue are not moral. One example that was brought up was a text in the Old Testament, which supported the ownership of slaves. Uvenio responded by encouraging Karofsky to read the passage in its entirety before taking it out of context.
During their closing statements, each debater encouraged audience members to examine their own personal beliefs. The main takeaway from Karofsky was that if you cannot accept the whole Bible, then you should just drop it all together. Uvenio also left the audience with something to think about: “Science says that you are a whole lot of matter, but God says you matter a whole lot.”
Outside the content of the debate, it seems that the event itself went over very well with those who attended. Audience members were able to tweet questions and comments using the hashtag #BASICDebate.
“I had the opportunity to speak to some of the other students who came from different schools to this event as well as some of our own students. All of them were still talking about the debate and all seem genuinely intrigued by it,” said Caitlin Kennedy, sophomore Health Sciences major and president of the Debate Team.
“Bringing people together based on their differences, rather than similarities, is really beautiful to me. It opens doors and opportunities for so many things,” said Amal Zeidan, senior Nutrition and Dietetics major and BASIC president.
Unfortunately, the event was cut short because of a scheduling conflict. However, video recording of the debate will be uploaded to YouTube soon, so be on the look out for that as well.

Everyone’s favorite hammer-wielding superhero is back in the new film, “Thor: The Dark World,” released on Nov. 8. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the gruff and humble Asgardian prince. Unlike its predecessor, this film focuses less on Earth and more on Thor’s home planet of Asgard, as well as another planet the new antagonists are native to.
The film opens with Thor’s father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), telling the story of the Dark Elves; a race of outer-Earthly creatures who waged war against Asgard. The Dark Elves are led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), who seeks to destroy the nine realms of the universe by the means of a weaponry force, called the Aether. This prologue ends with the Dark Elves supposed demise, and the hiding of the Aether. While this build-up does not feature any of the main characters, it is necessary to understand the film, and the motivation behind the antagonist.
When the story turns its attention to Earth, it focuses on London, a setting differing from other Marvel movies. The quirky group of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), and Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) all return, due to strange readings coming from an abandoned factory in London.
The factory ends up possessing a gap in physics, where objects can disappear into another realm, or simply hop back and forth between Earth and the other realm. Jane and Darcy, along with Darcy’s new intern Ian (Jonathan Howard), unknowingly uncover the hidden evil of the Aether.
Fan-favorite, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), makes an appearance in the second scene of the film. Loki is sentenced to life in prison due to his actions in “The Avengers.” Hiddleston portrays Loki with the same mischievous grin and quiet wit, which causes so many to admire this villain, whose gears perhaps shift to an anti-hero role in “The Dark World.”
Senior Film major Jeremy Benavides said, “I’ll just say that Loki was the best thing about it, and it had some cool action scenes, but otherwise, I was disappointed with the story, villain, and humor.”
Other students, some who have not seen it yet, are excited. Sarah Taylor, a junior Musical Theatre major, said, “I loved the first movie. I’m really excited for the second one and I’m excited to see Chris Hemsworth again.”
This film is a solid sequel with action, special effects, and a light-heartedness that is standard in most of Marvel’s movies. Thor’s character development from the first movie, through “The Avengers,” and to the present has also made him a more likable lead. He’s been fleshed out since his earlier moments of arrogance and brawn witnessed in “Thor,” and has truly, as Odin states, proven himself a worthy hero.

The Rifle Range Theatre on campus is staging readings of excerpts from Musical Theatre student Ion Constantine’s “Daniel: An Ordinary Tragedy.” Dates include Nov. 22 and 23 at 7:30 p.m., and Nov. 24 at a 3:00 p.m. matinee. Constantine, the pen name of Paulie Pecorella, is joined by LIU Post Professor David Hugo for further direction and advisory of the production. Constantine and Hugo’s work together began as a chance encounter.
“I heard [Constantine] playing [piano] in a room one day,” said Hugo. “At the time, I was directing ‘Cabaret’ and we needed a pianist. He’s a great musician – I actually thought he was someone else. I thought he was staff here, that he worked here as a pianist.”
The two began to work together, and soon enough Constantine introduced Hugo to his own writing. “I was really inspired by his work,” continued Hugo. “Since he helped me out last year, I figured that supervising his production would be a way of paying him back.”
The story of “Daniel” centers on the titular character: a young gay man on a journey of self-discovery, seeking fulfillment through his relationships with others. With a deep existential dependence on his romantic relationships, he seeks validation.
Daniel meets three different men – each of whom offers elements of what would compose the ideal relationship. But none of them are perfect, as Daniel finds out, and his attempts at finding the romanticized ideal of a lover prevent him from realizing those who actually love him.
“He feels incomplete because he’s not in a relationship,” said Constantine. “And he finds that one man, or one person, cannot fulfill the things that make someone complete.”
This problem of identity is one of several ongoing conflicts for Daniel. His mother is an alcoholic, and he grows apart from his closest friends as he becomes increasingly consumed with filling the gap he feels is keeping him from being happy. “He’s this guy who’s looking for validation through love,” noted Hugo.
“I feel like he’s very misunderstood,” said Cody L Petit, who plays Daniel. “The way that I like to describe him [is] he’s very eager to show his feelings and be emotional.” Like Constantine, Petit is a sophomore studying Musical Theater.
The production of “Daniel” stretches back several years. In junior year of high school, Constantine began transposing some of his real life into a story, eventually incorporating his musical talent. “It was just an outlet to have fun, make some scenes and character names, and then it developed and I began writing songs to it.”
At the end of his senior year, Constantine was accompanied by his writing partner, Amar Benkhoukha, in further developing “Daniel.” This past summer, “Daniel” was featured in the American Academy for New Musical Theater for their Stages New Musical Theater Festival in Los Angeles. “Then I applied it to [LIU Post] at the Rifle Range Theater Lab for the season. It was picked up and it’s been a work in progress since,” he continued.
While he did recently compose for the student production of “Marat/Sade” at the Little Theatre, Constantine has placed most of his efforts in the continued development of “Daniel.” “It was just applied to the New Musical Theater in New York for the Spring,” he said. “Hopefully it will get accepted and be able to be produced there as a full production.”

It was expected to be a close match, but it wasn’t. The top-seeded Pioneers blew out the Dowling College Golden Lions at home in the second round of the NCAA playoffs on Saturday, Nov. 16. This crucial win advances the Pioneers to the third round, the Sweet 16.

Pioneer fans held their breath for the first 18 scoreless minutes. They breathed a sigh of relief when senior midfielder Jonathon Watkin scored the first goal of the game off an assist by sophomore midfielder Per Forgaard. A quick three minutes later, the Pioneers’ leading scorer, junior forward Eivind Austboe, notched a goal of his own.
Less than three minutes later, senior back Eirik Bjoernoe scored off an assist by sophomore midfielder Matias Ruiz. A free kick just over 10 minutes later led to a fourth Pioneer goal. Less than two minutes before the half, Forgaard scored off an assist by Bjoernoe, for a 5-0 lead at halftime.
The second period started with a new goalkeeper in for Dowling. Daniel Jenson did his best to stop the Pioneers from scoring, but his efforts fell short. Another Watkin goal off an assist by Forgaard brought the Pioneers to a 6-0 lead. The Golden Lions finally made it onto the scoreboard in the final 11 minutes of action.
The 6-1 win advances the Pioneers to play Southern New Hampshire University at 10 a.m. at Mercyhurst Soccer Field in Erie, P.A. in the third round of the NCAA playoffs on Friday, Nov. 22. The winning team of that match will hold the 2013 NCAA Division II East Region title, and advance to play the winner of the match-up between Millersville and Mercyhurst, on Sunday, Nov. 24.

On Saturday, Nov. 16, the LIU Post football team (5-6) rounded out its 2013 season with a 62-28 victory over the Pace University Setters (0-11) in the Northeast-10 Championship Weekend of games.
The Pioneers kickstarted the scoring with a touchdown on their first possession. Red-shirt freshman quarterback Matt Brennan conducted an 80- yard drive and found fellow red-shirt freshman wide receiver Michael Richardson for the 11-yard touchdown pass. After trading empty possessions, the Setters aimed for seven points. Starting in enemy territory, the Setters converted fourth down opportunities twice on their drive, and cashed in with a touchdown, evening the score at seven.
After a muffed punt return by Pace, Richardson recovered the ball and ran 36 yards to the Setters’ 23- yard line. Four plays later, junior tight end Tyler Heuer found the end zone on a two- yard rush, giving the Pioneers a 17-7 lead. Richardson set the Pioneers up again on their next possession with a punt return that brought them close to midfield. Brennan connected with four Pioneer receivers on the short drive that resulted in an eight-yard strike from Brennan to red- shirt junior wide out Kamron Palmer.
Right before halftime, LIU Post capped off their impressive second quarter with another touchdown. This time it was red-shirt senior wide receiver Joe Botti who caught a 21-yard pass from Brennan. The Pioneers went into halftime up 31-7.
As the second half moved along, Richardson continued his stellar play from the first half. On the Pioneers’ second drive, Richardson accounted for 41 of the 70 yards, including a 20-yard reception from Brennan, adding to the lead, and making it 38-7. The Pioneers added a field goal on their next possession, extending the lead to 41-7. The Setters showed little fight, and scored a touchdown on their next possession, making the score 41-14. On the green and gold’s next drive, Brennan was picked off by senior defensive back Jashon Dawson, who took it the other way for a score. The score held at 41-21 at the end of the third quarter.
Two LIU Post rushing touchdowns in the fourth quarter extended their lead even further, pushing the score to 55-21. Adding to the already sizeable advantage on the scoreboard was junior defensive back Roger Hamilton. Hamilton intercepted Setters’ junior quarterback Brian Beeker, and found his way to the end zone. A late touchdown by Pace completed all the scoring of the day. The final score was 62-28, in favor of the Pioneers.
For the Pioneers, Brennan finished 16-27 for 222 yards and four touchdowns. In addition to his contribution through the air, Brennan also ran for 52 yards and a score. The Pioneers’ ground attack as whole, which featured eight people, gained 257 rushing yards. Richardson ended the day with three catches, two of which went for touchdowns, and 53 yards receiving. Botti caught five passes for 68 yards and a touchdown as well. Defensively, red-shirt junior defensive lineman Dan Belfiore had three quarterback hurries, a sack, and two and a half tackles for a loss.
For the Setters, Beeker was 18-39 through the air with a touchdown, an interception, and a total of 122 yards. Dawson was their leading rusher, running the ball only nine times, but tallying up 96 yards and a touchdown.
Some notable seniors this season included: Joe Botti, Chris DiIorio, Tommy Williams, and Rob Bright. The Pioneers concluded their 2013 campaign at a 5-6 mark, improving their record from the 2012 season.
