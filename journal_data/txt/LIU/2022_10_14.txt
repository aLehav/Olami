From Friday, Sept. 30, to Sunday, Oct. 2, the Sharks women’s golf team competed among 16 universities in their third competition of the season at the Navy Fall Invitational. 
The Sharks finished fifth as a team. However, out of 88 total competitors, it was Sharks’ senior Emily Byrne who came out on top. Her 2-over-par score of 146 was three strokes ahead of the second-place finisher, Anna Ferreyra-Heit from Delaware State. 
This is Byrne’s first season at LIU after playing three years at Limestone University in South Carolina. 
Byrne was also the Sharks’ top performer over the first two events of the season. At the Delaware State Fall invitational on September 19-20, Byrne finished fifth individually, only one stroke away from tying for first with the other top four golfers. 
In the week leading up to the Navy Fall Invitational, Byrne finished first for the Sharks at the Boston College Intercollegiate. 
Byrne is from Liverpool, England, but knew for many years she had a goal of playing golf in the NCAA. 
“I’ve been playing golf for about 10 years now, and ever since I was about 14 or 15, I had friends who were coming over here and started playing college golf,” she said. “Then, when I got to about 15 and 16, I set my heart on playing golf and then getting to the collegiate level.”
With a combination of her athletic and academic plans in mind, Byrne had her heart set on coming to the Big Apple to finish her collegiate career. 
“I was down in South Carolina, and I decided I wanted to change and started looking in terms of location to be a business major,” she said. “I wanted to head up to New York, and then I started looking around this area and found LIU. I looked at the team, then started communicating with the coach and decided it was definitely the school for me.”
Bryne knew it was going to be important to make an impact early on in her playing time here at LIU, and she could not have wished for a better outcome. 
“It’s amazing, I’m just on cloud nine right now. Coming over here, I didn’t know where my golf was going to be. I had quite a big injury over the summer, and I was not sure if I was going to be able to play at the level I knew I could,” she said. “After I got here and had all the encouragement from the team and all the support I needed, to come and play really well is big for me.”
Despite the conditions of the long weekend, Byrne credits her performance, along with that of the team, to the perseverance they have shown so far this season.
“We had very bad weather the whole time. We had the back end of the hurricane, so we just wanted to get through and stay as dry as we could,” she said. “Just knowing I had to get through it and stay strong mentally helped it.”
Byrne was named a Northeast Conference (NEC) Prime Performer for the month of September. She could not have been more thrilled for the honor.
“I was really shocked and just couldn’t have expected this first month to go any better, so I’m excited to see the rest of the season and see how I do,” Bryne said.
Bryne looks to capitalize on her success early on at LIU and collectively carry it throughout the rest of the season.
“The goal is definitely to win the conference with the team we have and a great set of girls who have the ability to do it,” she said. “Personally, I just want to enjoy the last two years that I have of college golf with a great team.”

 The National Football League (NFL) and it’s Players’ Association (NFLPA) conducted a joint investigation on the treatment of Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa following consecutive weeks of head injuries. 
The initial injury sustained took place in the second quarter of the Dolphin’s Week 3 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sept. 25. Tagovailoa was shoved by Bills linebacker Matt Milano, hitting his head against the turf. Aft the big hit, the Hawain native stumbled when trying to get up.
The video, which went viral for the gross motor instability displayed by Tagovailoa, seemed to be a clear indication that the promising young quarterback was concussed and would not return to the game. However, Tagovailoa was reported to have a mild back injury, clearing concussion protocols and returning to the game in the third quarter. 
With the situation already raising some questions regarding the protocol and player safety, Tagovailoa started the following Thursday, Sept. 29, against the Cincinnati Bengals and sustained another head injury in the second quarter. 
This injury, which occurred with 5 minutes and 15 seconds left in the first half, was particularly scary, as following the sack by Bengals defensive lineman Josh Tupou, Tagovalioa’s arms and fingers went stiff, displaying a condition known as a “fencing response” that occurs after an individual gets knocked unconscious. 
Thankfully, Tagovalioa was rushed to the hospital and was diagnosed with only a concussion, as many feared the damage was far greater. 
Regardless of the mild diagnoses, Junior Broadcasting major Brendan Kaufman believes that Tagovalioa shouldn’t have been put in that situation. 
“The Dolphins’ medical staff clearly didn’t do their job well enough considering that they cleared Tua [Tagovalioa] to play when it seemed obvious to everyone watching that he shouldn’t have been playing,” he said. “Tua [Tagovalioa] should’ve been benched for Bridgewater during that game long before it was forced to happen.”
Following the consecutive injuries, the NFL and NFLPA launched a two-week-long investigation, interviewing all of the staff and medical personnel involved in evaluating the injuries sustained by Tagovalia. 
Immediately after the investigation launched, the Dolphins fired an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant after they were found to have made “several mistakes” in their evaluation of Tagovailoa, according to ESPN.
Brady Campbell, a junior broadcasting major, felt it was unfair to place the blame on one person. 
“I understand why they made the decision, but it’s not completely fair. This goes all the way down to the coaches,” he said. “Someone should have realized that he was unfit to play. As a college student who doesn’t study in this field, even I knew something was wrong.”
Kaufman agreed, citing that the member of the medical staff was likely a scapegoat. 
“This firing was just the NFL or the Dolphins trying to find a fall guy for the whole situation,” he said. “It might have been this guy’s fault, but it was likely a group effort that caused this whole controversy rather than just this one neurotrauma consultant.”
The investigation concluded with a joint statement by both parties on Oct. 8, which stated that the issue was with the league’s concussion protocols, not the Miami Dolphins’ handling of it. 
Campbell did not agree with this conclusion. 
“I don’t think that they should have let him get back to football activities that quickly,” he said. “There are definitely some holes in the protocol, but the team did not handle it well at all based on the fact that he lost his balance and had clear signs of a concussion the week before.”
Despite the uproar that the Tagovalia situation caused, injuries of this nature are nothing new in the NFL. Although the number of concussions per season has declined over the last few years, there has still been an average of 228 concussions in practice and games per year since 2015. 
Campbell, like many neurologists and medical experts, believes this is a problem that the NFL needs to address. 
“Safety is a major issue in the NFL. Obviously, it’s a violent contact sport to begin with, so there will be plenty of injuries,” he said. “However, some of these injuries seem a lot more preventable with the right safety measures in place. I feel that the league is so caught up in what makes the sport fun that they forget the danger that comes with it. 
With the NFL taking a lot of the blame for this incident, Kaufman believes the players have some responsibility as well. 
“Players playing through injury makes sense from their point of view, but that doesn’t mean that they should. I think players should try to understand their limits a lot better than they currently do, and they 100% should not try to play through concussions since those things are dangerous,” he said. “Player safety, in general, is a huge issue in the NFL, and things like this are part of that in addition to other factors like inconsistent ruling for dirty or clean hits or poor field conditions like at Metlife [stadium].”
The NFL and NFLPA sought to address the issues found within the concussion protocol when they made revisions to include the diagnosis of “axatia.” According to NFL.com, “Ataxia is defined as an abnormality of balance/stability, motor coordination or dysfunctional speech caused by a neurological issue.” Under this new definition, players would not be allowed to return to play if they exhibit this condition in any way. 
The updated protocol was put in place during Week 5 and already came into effect following an injury to Miami Dolphin’s backup quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, who was deemed unfit to return to the game under the new ruling.  
Campbell believes that it shouldn’t stop there. 
“I feel like they may want to find a way to use something like those ‘guardian’ caps that they wore in training camp to decrease the likelihood of a head, neck, or back injury. I also believe that they need to find a way to limit the risk of lower leg injuries,” he said. “Whether it’s the turf causing torn ligaments or seriously injuring an ankle due to the constant collisions and players landing on each other, there are plenty of other safety measures they should want to look to improve upon.”

“Don’t Worry Darling,” the new psychological thriller directed by Olivia Wilde was released on Sept. 23, 2022. 
Florence Pugh plays the role of Alice and Harry Styles who is the supporting actor plays Jack. They play the perfect couple in the fictional town named Victory where everything is perfect. While the men leave for their top secret job, the women stay at home to cook, clean and shop. The community was created by Frank, who is played by Chris Pine, he is in charge of everything that happens in the town of Victory making sure everything is perfect. 
Although everything is perfect, Alice slowly starts to realize that her perfect life may not be as perfect as it seems. She starts to hallucinate and manages to uncover the many secrets of her community that nobody else seems to understand.
Some viewers of the movie found this portion of the film distressing and anxiety inducing.
“It was really bothering me that no one would believe Alice, but I get why because Alice used to be like that with Margaret and not believing her for hallucinating first,” sophomore biology major at Hofstra University Kaylah Rivera said. “I wish I was able to teleport into the movie and help a sister out.”
The film itself was filled with visuals from 50s style outfits, cars and homes. It would then jump to striking creepy images. When Alice was hallucinating, she always had images of eyes, dancers, and drops of blood. 
Although it was interesting to watch, some viewers felt the images lacked meaning in the context of the plot of the film. 
“I enjoyed the film. I even enjoyed seeing what Alice was hallucinating but, I wish there was more to detail to it. I wish I understood why she saw dancers. The eyes I got because her own eyes were being held open but the dancer… I just don’t get it,” senior education major at Queens College Lauren Hernando said.
Audience members enjoyed the intensity of the film, but many were frustrated with the ending. Many said the ending felt abrupt, slightly unfulfilling and all around rushed. The film ended with Alice placing her hands at the top of the mountain making her wake up from the alternate universe which was known as “Victory” to her going back to her real life. Once she placed her hands it went to a black screen and a gasp for air was heard before the credits then appeared. 
“I went to watch the movie twice to see if I really understood the movie more, especially the ending. I just wish there was more to it. I would’ve loved to see [Alice] waking and seeing Jack dead beside her. I feel like it could’ve been better especially with all the hype built around the film,” sophomore musical theatre major Grace McNally said. 
Many fans have created their own theories about the film. One explained how Alice would constantly scratch or touch her eyes because they were being held open in real life. Another was: the red plane that Alice saw was her seeing red lasers passing her eyes. And, how when Alice was going to make tuna Jack said not to because Fred did not like it, meanwhile it’s because that’s all Jack ate in the real world. The most creepy theory was how Violet, the new member of the community, was actually kidnapped in the real world by Bill and was forced to be his wife in the simulation hence why she was always anxious. 
Some viewers have their own theories regarding how the simulation worked.
“We all know Frank was behind all this and once he found out Alice was slowly no longer being hypnotized, he was tormenting her by making her suffocate in an enclosed space island in her bath. I think he was able to control her in the real world and not in the simulation,” Hernando said. 
Towards the end of the film, Alice knew exactly what was going on and since she was no longer hypnotized she was able to help the other wives realize the truth, which is why we saw the women becoming aware of what Alice was saying this whole time. In order to escape, they had to kill themselves in it which is how Margret escaped and no one saw her again. 
There are many questions still left unanswered, but audiences are having fun trying to put the pieces together.

The MLB Playoffs are a fierce competition between teams that have survived the season and are in the thick of the action, and fan expectations are rising. 
Coming into the 2022 season, the MLB and Players’ Association agreed to expand the playoffs from 10 teams to 12. In the new expanded playoff format, each of the six division winners automatically gets a bid, and then there are three wild card teams from the American League (AL) and National League (NL). Each of the top two seeded division winners from each league got a first-round bye for the wild card round, with the other eight teams competing to move on to the Division Series.
The New York Yankees have now made the playoffs for the sixth straight year, finishing the season with a record of 99-63. On Sept. 27, the Yankees clinched a divisional title in the AL East for the first time in three years with a 5-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Expectations are high for the Yankees, as they have not won the World Series since 2009, despite 10 postseason appearances since. Therefore, many people hope that this year will be the year they become world champions. After finishing second in the AL, The Yankees are currently taking on the Cleveland guardians, who swept the Tampa Bays in the Wild Card Round. 
On the other hand, the Seattle Mariners have made the playoffs for the first time in 21 years, with a record of 90-72. The last time the Mariners made the playoffs was in 2001, so it will get a lot of attention to see what kind of games they will play. On Sept. 30, the Mariners clinched a playoff spot with a dramatic 2-1 win over Oakland Athletics. It was pitchers duel on both sides, with the game tied at 1 heading into the 9th inning. However, a solo homer from Cal Raleigh for the Mariners sealed the deal, giving them a spot in the playoffs as the second Wild Card seed in the AL. There is a great deal of excitement in Seattle, as this is their first postseason appearance in 21 years.
Junior computer science major at the University of Washington, Travis Lee, who is living in Seattle, has been waiting for this his whole life.
“This year has been a very exciting year for Mariners fans. I have lived in Seattle since I was born, and this is the most exciting year of my life as a Mariners fan,” he said. “The year I was born was 2001, and they had never made the playoffs since I was born. So, I am very happy they made it to the playoffs this year. I hope this momentum will help the Mariners become a world champion.”
The San Diego Padres clinched a playoff spot on Oct. 2. Their 89-73 record was good enough for the second wild card seed in the NL. This is the Padres’ first playoff appearance in two years, and one of the players that made a huge impact this year was Yu Darvish. Yu Darvish was a major contributor to the team this season, bringing them 16 wins. 
Junior business management major at Fresno Pacific University, Koutaro Matsumaru, who is from Japan, confirms how closely Darvish’s home country is eyeing the Padres’ push in October.
“Darvish’s participation in the playoffs has been widely reported in the Japanese news,” he said. “We are looking forward to his performance in the playoffs.”
The San Diego Padres defeated the New York Mets two games to one in the Wild Card Round. In game one, Yu Darvish only allowed one run over seven innings, securing the 7-1 victory. After the Mets won game two by a score of 7-3, the Padres shut out the Mets 6-0 on Sunday, Oct. 8, to clinch the series and move on to the NLDS, where they will take on their divisional rival, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers won the NL West with the best record in baseball of 111-51.
In this way, the playoff attracts attention from all over the world and becomes a major event for many people. The remaining eight teams will look to solidify their ticket to the World Series.

The Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver is facing some trouble, with calls to leave the NBA franchise following a league invention that found many occurrences of inappropriate workplace behavior. 
This includes the use of racial slurs and demeaning/harsh treatment of employees. On Tuesday, Sept. 12, after the NBA published the findings, they suspended Sarver from all activity related to the franchise for one year and fined him $10 million. 
PayPal also announced it would pull out of its sponsorship of the team if Sarver returns after his suspension. This deal was worth $3 million last season, according to ESPN.
NPR interviewed the CEO and President of PayPal, Dan Schulman, who had a couple of words to say about the situation.
“We have reviewed the report of the NBA league’s independent investigation into Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver and have found his conduct unacceptable and in conflict with our values,” Schulman said.
ESPN reported that Suns Vice Chairman Jahm Najafi, who owns the second-largest stake in the team, wrote a letter to team employees calling for Sarver to resign. Sarver’s stake in the team would be valued at $630 million, based on estimates. 
Junior finance major Jaiden Roe was devastated to hear about the news. 
“A Similar behavior by any CEO, executive director, president, teacher, coach, or any other position of leadership would call for to be immediately fired,”  Roe said. “The fact that Robert Sarver owns the team does not give him any right to treat others differently. They should be held to the same standard as anyone in that organization no matter what.”
Among the reported findings, people say that Sarver, on at least five occasions during his time with the Suns, repeated the N-word when recounting the statements of others.
He engaged in instances of inequitable conduct toward female employees and made many sex-related comments in the workplace. He also engaged in inappropriate physical conduct toward female employees on several occasions.
Owner Robert Sarver on Wednesday announced that he has begun the process to sell both the NBA’s Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury franchises.
Junior Suns fan Meko Mayes supports Sarver’s separation from the team.
“I fully support the decision by Sarver to sell the teams,” he said. “This is the right next step for the organization and community.”
The NBA instructed the information after ESPN published a story last year that reported many of the same allegations about Sarver’s behavior.

Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka was suspended for the whole 2022-2023 season over violation of team rules. Udoka had an affair with the team travel planner, while simultaneously leading them to the second seed in the Eastern Conference and all the way to the NBA Finals, but lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games.
Udoka’s relationship with the staff member was made aware to some Boston staffers in July but wasn’t seen as an issue at the time due to the relationship being consensual.
“I want to apologize to our players, fans, the entire Celtics organization and my family for letting them down,” Udoka said in a statement. “I am sorry for putting the team in this difficult situation, and I accept the team’s decision. Out of respect for everyone involved, I will have no further comment.”
Udoka has been in a relationship with Nia Long since 2010 and the two have a son together.
Players and fans have been stunned with the news surrounding this suspension. Star players like Jayson Tatum found out about the suspension when it was reported on social media. Jaylen Brown told reporters at Celtics Media Day there is going to be a lot more information to investigate. 
“From what we know, it’s hard to make a decision based upon whether it’s consensual or not in the workplace or whatever’s going on,” Brown said. “Which we know has happened before in the workplace, but I guess there’s more to it possibly, which we don’t know.”
Freshman sports management major Dylan Wilson was shocked to hear the news.
“It’s the last thing you would’ve expected from this offseason,” Wilson said. “The Celtics coming into this year as a heavy favorite just to lose their head coach before the games even start. That’s just insane to think about honestly.” 
The Celtics were seen as favorites to go back to the finals and seal the deal this time around at +600 odds(via DraftKings). 
Freshman business management major Nic Young is still hopeful in championship aspirations for the Celtics this season.
“There’s still a chance. It’s lower now since the East is once again stacked and our head coach is gone, but a chance nonetheless,” Young said.
Ime Udoka’s future in the NBA is definitely in question. It seems that he doesn’t plan to resign with the Celtics after the suspension. The Celtics won’t stand in Udoka’s way of becoming a head coach somewhere else, and there are teams who have tried to get a full understanding of the situation before properly showing interest. Assistant coach Joe Mazulla was named interim head coach for the season by the Celtics organization.

In recent times, there has been a large cultural shift towards promoting cultural diversity. An inclusive culture means celebrating cultural differences amongst people. Reality TV in particular has been a huge influence in the promotion of inclusivity. The show “Big Brother” on CBS is a show that happens once a year during the summer where 16 houseguests are cut off from the outside world and compete in competitions to prevent their elimination. The show has actively been working to create a more inclusive cast with each season. 
Students on campus view the increase in diversity on screen as a positive change.
“Movies have become increasingly diverse and it’s great to see that major television networks are moving in the same direction,” says junior fashion merchandising major Grace Catanese. 
Casting contestants of different backgrounds allows fans of the show to develop a new appreciation for cultures that are different from their own. “Big Brother” contestants have previously made it a point to develop alliances with each other to make history and ensure a person of color wins the game. 
Last year, during season 23, an all Black alliance known as the Cookout was able to run the house all the way until the end. Which not only meant that a Black winner would finally be crowned, but also for the first time six people of color were the final six contestants. At the end of this season, a Black man named Xavier Prather won.
On Sept. 25, , the show concluded its 24th season. For the first time in the show’s history, a black woman,  Taylor Hale, won.
Most fans have seen her win as deserved as she also went on to win America’s Favorite Player, an $75,000 prize awarded to the player who America voted as their favorite on CBS’s official website. The voting begins approximately three weeks prior to the finale airing. However, others believe that her win was the result of foul play from production.
Catanese, a fan of the show, considers the accusations of foul play ludicrous.
 “I think that it’s absurd that people could accuse Big Brother of rigging their show because they have live feeds, and if there was foul play it would have been caught and exposed,” Catanese said. 
On the show, live feeds are available for fans to watch what is going on in the house at any given part of the day. The only time that the feeds go down are during competitions to which they are shown when the show goes on air, but also when the show is live, such as on eviction nights. 
Hale’s win was the result of a game that revolved mainly on her social skills. She was up for eviction a total of six times yet stayed due to her bonds and connections with other houseguests. 
To actually win the show, when there are eleven houseguests remaining, nine of the eleven, based on who gets evicted next, will become jurors that will eventually vote for the winner. 
Fans of the show analyzed Hale’s game strategy and believe that was ultimately the key to her success.
“[Hale’s] strategy and her gameplay was undeniably the best and that is why the jurors voted for her to win,” junior business administration major Lauren Ritirato said. 
The allegations that the show was rigged by production is not based on any factual information . Fans are able to keep up with the houseguests in real time and can theoretically watch the entire summer unfold. 
Hale not only captured the hearts of her fellow houseguests, but also the hearts of America. This is evidenced by not only her win of America’s Favorite Player, but also the unwavering amount of love she has received from fans on her historic win.

On Sep. 15, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) sent a bus full of migrants to the Washington D.C. residence of Vice President Kamala Harris (D) without letting the VP know of his actions. 
This was just a first piece of a flurry of migrant movements across the United States by Republican governors, as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) chartered two flights of around 50 migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) sent buses full of migrants to New York. 
Since April, Abbott has been transporting migrants in buses all around the U.S.without forewarning, but he has mainly targeted Democratic-run states. Now with the transportation of migrants to Kamala Harris’ residence, many people think Abbott has gone too far. 
Junior actuarial science major Vincent Randazzo believes that there is a fine line that Abbott is walking in between illegal and legal. 
“Although morally incorrect, [Abbott] is not entirely wrong in doing so. It is the way that he does it though that’s the issue. What he’s doing now in general isn’t terrible. It just needed to be coordinated with the states and the federal government,” Randazzo said. 
One of the biggest complaints about what governors Abbott and DeSantis are doing with these migrants is that they are lying to them about their future in America and where they can settle down and make a life. There were also some instances in which these migrants were lied to and told they were headed to a different location. According to Chris Mangus, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, all of the governors sending migrants to northern cities and states are lying. 
In an interview with WCWP’s Robert Amato, host of Seldom Said, Patrick Young, the Downstate Advocacy Director of the New York Immigration Coalition and Professor of immigration law at Hofstra, talked about the decision of Gov. DeSantis to lie to migrants and flying them to Martha’s Vineyard. 
“What we’re seeing from these states is something I’ve seen back then,” Young said, in reference to 1960’s Louisiana buses north for African Americans. “What’s really going on there is this outrageous, cruel act by two governors supported of course by their followers in order to make the media and get on Fox News to push their political agendas… They’re using some of the most vulnerable people in the world to do it. What we saw with the shipment of people to Martha’s Vineyard was what we call trafficking. People were deceived.” 
 As of now according to the Texas Tribune, DeSantis is facing an investigation by a Texas sheriff and a federal lawsuit from Democratic lawmakers over DeSantis’ use of his $12 million migrant relocation fund. 
According to the Washington Post, U.S. arrests alongside the Mexico border have topped two million a year for the first time. That number is a 175 percent increase from August of 2021. 
Abbott has even questioned President Joe Biden’s (D) border policies in the past. Following his decision to send buses to Washington D.C, Abbott spoke about why he did it all. 
“Washington D.C, finally understands what Texans have been dealing with every single day, as our communities are overrun and overwhelmed by thousands of illegal immigrants thanks to President (Joe) Biden’s open border policies,” Abbott’s press secretary Renae Eze said in a statement to CNN. 
As of now, there is no clear path to fix the migrant issue in the U.S, but there are ways that communities and organizations are stepping up to help migrants. 
“What we’ve been doing at the New York Immigration Coalition is organizing our members to meet the migrants at the buses coming up from Texas. To assist with these migrants, and working with the city and state governments,” Young said. “We want New York City and New York State to continue to work with us to provide support so that nobody suffers unduly.” 
With thousands of migrants being sent all around the country, cooperation, consideration and collaboration are driving points for the states dealing with the migrant issue.

Reality TV star, social media influencer and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian landed in hot water with federal regulations, specifically the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), who announced the charges against her stemming from a June 13, 2021 Instagram post she made promoting a crypto asset security offered by EthereumMax. 
Kardashian was paid $250,000 to post about crypto security tokens sold by EthereumMax on her Instagram account, asking her then 220 million followers: “Are you guys into crypto????” 
The post, featuring the hashtag “#ad,” included a link to the EthereumMax website, which gives users instructions about how to buy the tokens. She did this without disclosing the financial compensation she received, violating Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.
“This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors,” SEC chairman Gary Gensler, said in a news release. 
Gensler said the case also serves as a reminder that the law requires celebrities and others to disclose when and how much they’re paid to promote investing in securities.
Estimated to be worth $1.8 billion, Kardashian has agreed to settle the charges by paying $1.26 million in penalties, disgorgement, interest and cooperation with the Commission’s ongoing investigation. The payment includes the compensation she received, plus interest, and the $1 million penalty. Kardashian has also agreed not to promote crypto assets for three years and will cooperate with ongoing investigations along with SEC. 
However, Kardashian has not commented on the regulator’s feelings.
“I think it was an honest mistake and she was in the wrong, but she is willing to work with the company to make it right,” creative writing professor Gabrille Sharp said. “Kim could have learned more about the topic before creating the post. I think it was wrong for Kim to advertise it as though everyone has access to it and understands it. I think it’ll affect society as a whole, but I personally don’t understand anything about it.”
In a statement, Kardashian’s lawyer Michael Rhodes said his client is pleased to have resolved the matter. 
“Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC form from the very beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter. She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. The agreement she reached with SEC allows her to do that so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits,” Rhodes said.
Earlier in the year, there was a class-action lawsuit filed against EthereumMax, where Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather were both listed for an alleged “pump and dump” scheme. It alleges that EthereumMax used celebrity endorsements to pump up the token value to inflate the price before selling their shares for a profit. Failure to disclose payment for touting a stock is a direct violation of federal securities law. 
The SEC believes that the public deserves to know if promotion of an investment is unbiased or not. When a celebrity is compensated for promoting any kind of investment it’s considered biased.
PTW instructor Thomas Conklin feels that Kardashian could have taken steps to avoid this situation. 
“Being aware that she’s dealing with a lot of money, a huge paycheck, knowing the ins and outs, making sure she communicates with her team and knowing this whole process is legitimate,” Conklin said.
Because crypto is an unregulated space, many new projects have been popping up the last few years that are either complete scams or just don’t have any utility. Almost anyone can put together some sort of crypto project without needing to go through the proper registration process for traditional securities. It’s difficult for the public to know if a celebrity actually believes in a project, or if they’ve simply accepted payment for profit.

Tensions arose in Hillwood Commons during common hour when the LIU American Club tabled in support of the pro-life movement, facing opposition from pro-choice students on Thursday, Sept. 29.
Club members held up signs that read “Abortion is not right,” “Women have a right to support, not abortion” and “All humans deserve human rights,” among other things. 
Not long after the club set up their tables, pro-choice students began protesting their messaging. Students gathered next to the club’s table holding up signs, as well as coathangers in reference to illegal abortions that people used to have in the U.S. before Roe vs. Wade, which often involved coathangers. One student held up a sign that said “The foster care system is broken.” Others simply sat in support of the pro-choice activists.
Senior theatre arts major Virginia Alonso-Luis was among the students in the pro-choice demonstration.
“I was just looking forward to getting coffee, and there was some really visible content, anti-abortion content, that was irritating me…I was trying to ignore it, but then I found that it was so grating to me that I wanted to do something, but I didn’t want to insense the anti-abortion folk,” she said. “I didn’t want to be inflammatory right out the gate.” 
Alonso-Luis says that she thinks there is a time and place to be assertive, but that she didn’t want to be assertive right away. She made a sign on a piece of wood and sat down next to the American Club, demonstrating contrasting views to their tabling event.
“People ended up bringing their own posters, somebody brought hangers, a lot of people took it somewhere I didn’t think it was gonna go, which is a good thing,” she said.
Alonso-Luis is not part of any political groups on campus, and says that her political action at Post is to show students that they could voice their beliefs without having affiliations with political groups. 
“You don’t have to be represented by anyone, you don’t have to meet an institution’s arbitrary idea of what makes someone legitimate to organize, you could just do that,” she added.
Junior musical theatre major Adam Turner was among demonstrating students. Turner, like many others, joined Alonso-Luis in her effort to support the pro-choice viewpoint on abortion.
“I got back from class, walked into the door and saw a huge sign saying ‘abortion is not right’ and I saw that there was a small crowd of people chanting…I just instantly grabbed paper and started chanting because [abortion] is a right,” he said. 
Junior musical theatre major Zavie Ward was a part of the pro-choice group as well. They said that the university allowing the American Club to exist shows a lack of empathy.
“I want more empathy. I want the administrators of this school to take a look at the student body, and kind of reckon with the monster that they’ve created, because allowing an organization like the America Club to thrive and exist on this campus, I just think it’s heinous,” they said.
The American Club was approved by the Student Government Association in March of this year.
Ward feels that the group stands for something different than they say they do.
“The American Club portrays itself as just a patriotism club, but I feel like we all know what it is and what it stands for, especially something like this who’s president and most of its members do not have uteruses, and granted neither do I, but I’m standing in solidarity, I’m not trying to control anyone or tell anybody what they should do with their bodies,” they added. “People deserve their own autonomy.”
Turner sees the situation similarly to Ward.
 “Abortion is healthcare, it is a necessary thing that all women should have the power to choose what they do with their bodies,” he said. “That is not for us to control, especially all of these people without uteruses.”
Alonso-Luis says that she was there to support people with differing views from the American club. 
“There are people in our school who aren’t in alignment with those beliefs, who dont agree with harsh abortion legislation, and there are people who will support you if you are in an oppressive class that might be victimized by that kind of legislation,” she said. “If people are really uncomfortable with others getting abortions, their resources should go to sex-ed, community organization, etc, and not towards yelling at people and moralizing people who get abortions.”
The American Club declined to do an official interview with The Tide, however junior business administration major Matt Cairo, the club’s president, said “I think it’s pretty clear what we’re doing, we’re here to support the pro-life movement.”
Alonso-Luis has a message for the students at the demonstration in the wake of the events on the 29th. 
“I’m really grateful and appreciative that people came through, but if you have strong opinions about reproductive rights, about anything at all, you will not succeed in your unionizing efforts, in your community organization or in your protesting if you are only ever incentivized to organize when there’s someone opposing your beliefs,” she said. “When the America Club isn’t there, do you still act?”
