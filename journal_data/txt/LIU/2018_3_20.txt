The State of the University address by President Kimberly Cline, originally scheduled for Feb. 5, and then rescheduled for March 19, has been cancelled.
Faculty and administrators were notified about the address, the rescheduled date, and then the cancellation, by email.
The email to CACD faculty and staff stated: “Dr. Cline will be delivering a State of the University Address on Monday, February 5th at 12:30 pm in the Hillwood Lecture Hall. Please encourage students to attend as well.” The address was then postponed to March 19. Yet an email on March 14 stated: “The State of the University Address scheduled for Monday, March 19th has been canceled.”
In response to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the address, President Cline said, “the event was not cancelled, as it was never scheduled.”
“Several weeks ago, we began having discussions about adding a second event [in addition to the fall convocation] to recognize student, faculty, and university achievements that occur during the academic year, in light of the many successes taking place on our campuses,” Cline said in her email response. “Major university events do not come together overnight, they take weeks to prepare, which is why several proposed dates were held on the calendar. However, as the conversation shaped, other university commitments took precedence,” she said.
Vincent Giordano, a freshman economics major, mathematics minor, and honors student, has his own theory about the cancellation of the address. “It is possible that this may have been due to controversy surrounding the new credit policy. Many students on campus have become frustrated with the rollout and implementation of the new cap,” Giordano said. The newly announced cap provides that students who take more than eighteen credits, beginning in fall 2018, will be charged $1,000 extra for every credit they add.
“I recently joined a group of students who have begun lobbying against it,” Giordano said. “Many of us are concerned that we will now experience significant hurdles in making our schedules in the future, especially the performing arts students.” Many performing arts students take 20 or more credits, and do so to ensure that they have competitive resumés and qualifications upon graduation, he said.
“We are also concerned about degree completion,” Giordano said. While it is possible to complete most, if not all undergraduate degrees with a minimum of 15 credits per semester, often times classes fill up quickly during registration periods and students may have to forego taking degree requirements during certain semesters, meaning that they must double or even triple up during others.
Not every course is three credits, so the new policy presents a risk of exceeding the new cap of 18 credits. “Many science and mathematics majors, who usually carry courses with more than three credits, may run into roadblocks as well. There are many other concerns as well that have been brought to our attention,” he said.
Giordano does not know whether the cancellation of the university address was connected to the new policy. “I caution against rushing to a conclusion without enough solid information. While it may be possible that there is a link, it is also entirely possible that the President chose to call off the event for other unspecified and pertinent reasons. If it was cancelled because of the controversy, then my hope is that the administration is reviewing the new policy and rethinking it,” Giordano said.
Students may nonetheless protest the new 18 credit cap. “Our group has been active in planning organized, peaceful opposition [to the 18 credit cap] in general, so it is logical to assume that some form of protest may take place,” Giordano said.
This modification to the credit policy was made to follow best academic practices and to provide a reasonable track for students to graduate in four years, according to President Cline. “For example, the university’s degree requirement was recently reduced to 120 credits. This change reduces student costs and time to graduate, with an average reduction of eight to nine credits. LIU is committed to keeping tuition affordable, limiting increases to 2 percent a year, significantly below the national average,” she said.
Giordano emphasized that his efforts to oppose the new credit cap have been peaceful. “My main objective is to provide a rational frame-work that will serve as a platform to voice students’ concerns. I have begun to write a list of grievances and concerns, inviting all members of the group to add, revise and provide individual testimony. When we complete the review and revision process, my plan is for members to submit it to their fellow students, professors and deans, with the goal of fostering discussion on this critical issue,” he said.
“The most important underlying goal should be to have clear and open communication between the student body, the faculty and the administration, in order to bring about decisive change and, most importantly, compromise if necessary,” Giordano said. Giordano is working on a list of solutions that he will present to the administration.

As of fall 2018, students will be charged an estimated $1,000 per credit for any student taking over 18 credits a semester. Christopher Fevola, LIU’s vice president and chief financial officer, notified staff of the tuition change in an email sent on March 5. Current freshmen students were the first to be notified of the change through their promise coaches. Other students found out through word of mouth or from their department heads.
“This is an academically driven decision, not a financial one,” Lori Knapp, LIU Post’s vice president for academic affairs, said. “Long Island University is driven to support students and align practices to ensure on-time graduation while encouraging students to make the most of their experience,” Knapp said.
Many students are angered and confused by the new policy. “Currently, I’m taking 24 credits, all to do with either my major or my minors. It’s important to me because to graduate on time [spring 2019] I need to take over 18 credits a semester with my required classes plus honors classes. I need my major and both of my minors in order to go into a masters program in the field of my choice,” Cassidy Nelson, a junior musical theatre major and double minor in arts management and psychology, said.
“Twenty four credits. In this major there are only 13 people and most of our classes only occur once every few years since there are so little of us. If we want to graduate on time that means taking all the tech classes when they are offered and that often means going over on credits,” Kiely Boyington, a sophomore theatrical design and production major, said.
This modification was made to follow best academic practices and to provide a reasonable track for students to graduate in four years, according to President Kimberly Cline. “Our goal is for students to graduate in four years. However, during a recent review, it was discovered that a number of students were taking as many as 27 credits per semester.
This practice pointed to the need of better planning and a more in depth scheduling review. Carrying a double course load is not an academically sound practice. That is why the vast majority of universities have already adopted similar policies,” Cline said.
This is a standard national practice, and in our region, private institutions with similar policies include Hofstra, Adelphi, NYIT, and St. Joseph’s, according to Cline.
Some students are suggesting to plan a petition against the decision as well as possible protests, after this news erupted on the Emerging Student Theater Association (ESTA) Facebook group. Samantha Resnick, a junior musical theatre major with a minor in gender and society and an ESTA member, said they are all willing to participate in petitioning.
“If it comes down to that, and the school does not listen to our side and our stories, then yes, I will protest,” Cassidy said.
Some ESTA members have formed a Facebook page called “Tuition Initiative,” for students to join in the planning of petitions and if necessary protest (https://www.facebook.com/TuitionInitiativeLIUPost/).
The group represents students in the fight for their at fee education, according to a post made by ESTA member Aaron Cooper, a junior theatre major with a minor in film and arts management.
In order to graduate on time, students with double majors need to take approximately 18 to 21 credits per semester, according to J. Fordsman, a junior psychology and criminal justice major and assistant secretary to the office of the honors college. The same rate goes for students in the honors college as well, according to Tracy Christy, the secretary of the honors college.
Fordsman’s scholarship is for a specific major not offered at LIU. As a substitution, her scholarship allows her the exibility to double major in psychology and criminal justice to fulfill the requirement.
Fordsman never received an email about the change, nor did many upperclassmen students. She wasn’t notified until she visited her promise coach about her fall 2018 schedule. There are “communication problems across the board,” she said.
Joan Digby, director of the honors college, was unaware of the change until the Pioneer contacted her for an interview about it. Digby agreed that communication between departments and administration needs to be worked on as well. “Administrative decisions are being made without consultation of faculty; it doesn’t make any sense,” she said.
Yet, she believes that it could be a good move for students. Students need to “slow down and not put so much pressure about finishing first.”
“Enjoy all the opportunities to study, socialize and join organizations, such as the study abroad program,” Digby advised students. “I never understood why people are cramming credits. It’s humanly impossible to take 25 to 30 credits and do well,” she said.
“The flat fee covered approximately 18 credits for many years. It was only recently that the at fee covered approximately 25-30 credits per semester,” she said. According to Digby, some of her students were over-crowding, sometimes taking 35 credits a semester, so they could graduate “practically collapsing from exhaustion.”
However, Digby understands there are some special cases. “A musical theater student cannot perform without learning how to dance, as a music education major cannot conduct without taking a conducting course,” she said.
Sometimes additional hands on courses are necessary for some majors, requiring students to take more than 18 credits each semester. Digby suggested that for certain cases like double majors and more hands-on majors, some adjustments need to be made to the policy.
“This policy follows on other recent policies that follow best practices and support student success,” Knapp, the VPAA, said. “Other policies include reducing the undergraduate graduation requirement from 129 credits to 120 credits and revising the core curriculum to allow greater student exibility to explore areas of interests.”
“LIU now has a 120 credit requirement, a full course load to graduate on time is 15 credits per semester,” Knapp said. “The policy provides students with an extra class each semester, or 24 extra credits beyond what they need to graduate—within their current charges. This policy provides students with the exibility for a minor and in many cases, even a second major. Students can graduate with 144 credits with no extra charges,” Knapp said.
This change was made to improve student retention and graduation through better course management, according to President Cline. “It is not a decision to derive fiscal savings, and we are committed to working with students who have emergency situations,” she said.
“We realize that every student has different personal circumstances, it is our job to meet those needs and ensure student success. That is why we maintain emergency financial aid for students when unexpected issues arise. Students may appeal to enrollment services regarding this aid,” Knapp said.
The funds generated from the extra credit charges will go towards campus operations, according to Knapp, including $100 million in scholarship funds.

The Writing Center will host a “Women are Lit!” read-in event on Wednesday, March 28 from 12:30 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. in celebration of Women’s History Month.
The event, which will take place in the Great Hall of the Winnick mansion, is co-sponsored by the English department, the Black Student Union, and the Panhellenic Council.
Mary Pigliacelli, director of the writing center and an adjunct professor in the English department, said she and Professor Carolyn Grimstead, also an adjunct professor in the English department, decided to hold the event to celebrate writing done by women from all backgrounds.
“We want people to read pieces by women. We hope all different kinds of writing by women are represented,” Pigliacelli said. Readers are encouraged to read essays, letters, poetry, prayers, songs, testimonies, and even tweets during the event.
One student has already signed up to read an excerpt from “The Second Sex” by Simone de Beauvoir, Pigliacelli said. “We are open to hearing students read any writing by women.”
Pigliacelli will also read during the event. She chose to read the poem “Diving into the Wreck,” by Adrienne Rich, which she feels is a poem “telling women to think very deeply about where we are and how we fit into larger society structures- and what we can do about that.”
“Adrienne Rich was a pretty important voice and ally for all women during the women’s movement in the 1970’s,” Pigliacelli said. “She was involved in making the movement more inclusive.”
Inclusivity is important to Pigliacelli, who hopes for the “Women are Lit!” event to be an open, wide-ranging experience.
“I want the event to be a happy and moving celebration of women’s voices, and I am hoping that everyone will want to come.”
Students interested in reading at the event can email carolyn.grimstead@liu.edu. Refreshments will be served, and all are welcome to attend.

The School of Health Professions and Nursing will hold its second annual Interprofessional Education student event on April 3 at 12:30 in the Pratt Recreation Center.
The purpose of the event is to promote interprofessional education and practice, and allow students from different professions and majors to interact. Students will have the opportunity to learn and discuss different health professions and their roles and responsibilities in the areas of ethics and values.
The event will host group discussions with 10 students per one faculty member. Professors, graduate students and interns from the School of Health Professions and Speech Language Pathology will lead these discussions.
“The event prepares students to enter their respective professions with the essential skills needed to be a successful health professional, including the ability to communicate, have interpersonal skills, demonstrate cultural competence and an appreciation for ethics and values that govern health care delivery,” Stacy Gropack, dean of the college of health professions and nursing (CHPN), said.
Over 500 students and 50 faculty members from CHPN, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Education, Information and Technology will be in attendance. Students from programs in biology, biomedical science, chemistry, clinical lab sciences, forensic science, healthcare administration, health information management, health sciences, medical imaging, nursing, nutrition, psychology, public administration, social work, and speech language pathology will be participating.
Professors in CHPN decide which of their students should participate and then make it a course requirement. As of now the event is not open to students that are not enrolled in these courses.
The registration is closed for this year’s event but for more information about programs in the School of Health Professions and Nursing,

Electrolytes are the body’s key to energy production, cardiac function, water balance and movement. They do this by communicating with one another and with the rest of the body, to maintain a normal blood pressure, ensure that there’s the proper amount of fluid cushioning our bones and to regulate electric signals that enable smooth muscles (such as the heart and intestinal system) to relax and contract normally.
Electrolyte concentration is controlled by two major systems, the kidneys and the adrenal glands. These systems release hormones that signal electrolyte excretion, movement and reabsorption throughout the body. There are four important electrolytes that are essential to keep the body functioning; they are sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Sodium plays a crucial role in water balance since wherever it goes, water follows. Sodium is essential for proper heart, muscle and brain function, but here in America, due to a high reliance on processed fast foods with low quality salt, these beneficial effects are compromised. A high intake of this low quality salt causes the condition hypernatremia (high sodium), which has largely affected the American public. Large amounts of this low quality sodium causes high blood pressure and strains the heart, increasing the risk of cardiac episodes. Steering clear of traditional table salt (sodium chloride) and using more mineral dense sea salt can help rectify this problem.
Another vital electrolyte is potassium. Its primary duties are smoothing muscle contraction and controlling the electrical activity of the heart. Along with sodium, it’s extremely important to replenish your potassium after strenuous physical exercise (these two electrolytes are the rst to be lost through sweating). Some great sources of potassium are citrus fruits, potatoes and nuts.
It’s been known for centuries that calcium causes strong teeth and bones, but what we may not realize is our body’s calcium concentration plays a vital role in the release of certain hormones such as calcitonin and parathyroid hormone. Calcitonin, released by the thyroid gland, stimulates bones to absorb calcium, decreasing calcium concentration in your blood. Parathyroid hormone, released by the parathyroid glands, does the opposite. Calcium is also responsible for muscle contraction and interneuron communication. Some common sources of this mineral include dark, leafy green vegetables and dairy.
Magnesium in charge of stress management and muscle relaxation, but a sufficient level of it in the body is required for the proper allocation of all other electrolytes. Without enough magnesium, it’s impossible to rectify a potassium deficiency and it’s a lot harder to properly absorb calcium and avoid calcification of the arteries. Magnesium is an enzyme cofactor, meaning that in order for proper digestion and ATP (the body’s form of energy) synthesis, enough magnesium must be present. Some common sources of magnesium include dark chocolate, nuts, and seeds.
Electrolytes are important, but be sure to vary things up a bit. Consume enough water, and indulge in a colorful diet with lots of fresh foods. This is the best way to ensure you replenish yourself and your electrolyte losses.

Joining a greek organization in college can be one of the most anticipated extra curricular activities students look forward to joining during their college career. During recruitment week, the last week of September and the first week of February, organizations speak with prospective members. The organizations explain their values, what joining the organization entails, the benefits of joining and students make the decision whether to join the sisterhood or brotherhood.
Casey McManus, a member of Alpha Xi Delta and senior early childhood education major, encourages students to join a sorority to discover new found potential. “By joining a sorority you will be able to gain a lifetime of sisterhood, leadership and will be more involved on campus,” McManus said.
McManus decided to join because she had friends in the sorority and they thought she would be a good asset. McManus describes Alpha Xi Delta as diverse and a sorority that stands on the fundamentals of philanthropy. For students who wish to join Alpha Xi Delta there will be an opportunity during the fall 2018 semester during recruitment week. She gives this advice to prospective sorority members. “Always remember to keep an open mind, and attend all of the interest events hosted by the sorority you are interested in joining,” McManus said.
Sigma Delta Tau member, and senior public relations major Kyra Rose, found herself after joining a sorority. “It gives me a sense of purpose and identity on this campus, especially because I transferred as a junior. I never made close friends like an average student would during freshman year,” she said. Rose took part in rush events Sigma Delta Tau held during recruitment week and met her sisters. “You have a six week learning period with a new member educator to help you learn about the history of Sigma Delta Tau while you create a bond with your pledge class as well as an active sister,” Rose said.
Sigma Delta Tau’s motto is “Patriae Multae Spes Una,” meaning, “One hope of many people.” As stated in the mission statement, the 1917 founded Sigma Delta Tau shares the same passion of empowering each member to reach their fullest potential. “We work together to fundraise money for our philanthropy as well as have sisterhood events that create a stronger bond as a chapter,” Rose said. Sigma Delta Tau fundraises for Jewish women all across the globe and donates to initiatives that support the fight against child abuse.
Cayla Michael, a junior musical theater major, said she found a home and became a part of something that is bigger than herself through greek life. “Something that really drew me to this sorority was the message of empowering women. I loved the fact that this was a sorority that was made up of strong and powerful group of women that we dedicated to supporting each other and encouraging each other to be the best we can possibly be,” Michael said.
Michael strongly believes anyone who is passionate about philanthropies, bettering the community and empowering women should become a member of Sigma Delta Tau. “We are always looking for strong, powerful, leaders who are ready to have a voice and be a part of something incredible,” Michael said.

The 90th installment of the Oscars took place at the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood and Highland Centre in Los Angeles, California on March 4, and the ceremony made history more than once this year. Guillermo del Toro nabbed the best director award for “The Shape of Water” and is only the third Mexican to claim the prize. Basketball player, Kobe Bryant took home his first award for best animated short film.
“I have always been a Kobe fan. It’s another win for him, and it’s great to see him doing things off the basketball court after his retirement. I’m proud of him,” Alex Ikhehedu, a senior broadcasting major, said. Bryant announced his retirement in the Players’ Tribune in Nov. 2015. The lm is a narration and visualization of his letter.
Actor Jordan Peele, widely known for his role in the movie “Keanu,” won the award for best original screenplay for his film “Get Out.” The film was nominated for best motion picture, best original screenplay, best performance by a leading actor, and best achievement in directing.
“Jordan Peele is making history. ‘Get Out’ was such an amazing film,” Taylor Hill, a senior broadcasting major, said. “I honestly believe that movie deserved all the awards that night.” The horror film is about a young interracial couple who just started dating. On a trip to Rose’s (Allison Williams) family house, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) initially feels the family’s behavior towards him is nothing but nervous attempts to deal with their daughter’s interracial relationship. As the weekend goes on, he discovers the real truth beyond his wildest imagination.
Michael Atkinson, a film professor, was one of the many people who went to see ‘Get Out.’ Atkinson believes to make a great screenplay it needs to have “originality, eloquence, power, intelligence, resonance and respect for the audience.” To those who are fans of film, it is no secret that there has been a lack of diversity within the film industry. 
When Atkinson found out Peele was the first African American to win in that category, it wasn’t a huge surprise.“I wasn’t shocked by Peele being the first, because I know the history of the industry. It’s reflective of almost every other aspect of society in that regard.” he said.
There has been a huge movement in pursuing equality for all, and hopefully the film industry will start to realize its wrong doings and start to improve things. “I think the Academy is trying to take a few big steps, in its own kind of affirmative action kind of way. As with any industrial system, Hollywood won’t balance out in terms of race or gender without getting pushed,” Atkinson said.
The film “Shape Of Water” took home a majority of the awards that night including best picture, best director, best production design and, best achievement in music written for motion picture. Many students have not yet seen the film. “I honestly never even saw a trailer for that movie, but it won about five awards, so I guess it’s worth checking out,” Luis Viloria, a junior broadcasting major, said.
Overall, the 90th academy awards was full of historic, tearful and lovable moments that make viewers wonder what next year will bring.

The #MeToo movement has started a nationwide discussion about sexual harassment, power dynamics, and the impact that social expectations and systems have on women’s professional and personal lives. LIU Post students have felt its impact.
“In a way I think the #MeToo movement is something that feels a long bit overdue,” Thomas Okin, a sophomore art major said. “For a long time you never knew anything regarding the sexual assault cases, and I think this movement really does bring out more information on sexual assault cases that have never been talked about, discussed, or ever been known to the public as a whole. I do hope that this #MeToo movement also brings up other sexual assault cases that haven’t been talked about or even discovered before.”
Okin is not alone in his views. “It’s something we should take seriously,” Alexandra Papageorge, a sophomore early childhood education major, said. “I think sexual assault is something that people need to be more aware of, and that whether you are a guy or girl you should have common sense to think about your actions and what you really do.”
Nicole Ludwig, a freshman psychology major, is in favor of the movement as a way for people to speak up about how they have been impacted by sexual assault. “I do know it’s a good thing that survivors are speaking up about their assault and their experiences and feeling united about it,” Ludwig said. “In our society people feel like they can’t talk about what has happened to them. Now it’s a great thing that they are standing up even if it’s just to cope with the past and not take legal action,” she added.
Ludwig acknowledged that people might take the movement wrong, but she thinks speaking up is better than silence. “It’s better to speak out than to be forced into silence because nothing can be solved if one stays quiet,” Ludwig said.

Creating this column has been a real eye opener for me. It has allowed me to put two of my favorite things together, writing and helping others. I never thought to put two and two together until this column.
The purpose of this column is to teach others that no matter what you are feeling or what situation you are stuck in, that you are not alone and that there are ways to get your life on track and be happy. Being happy with where your life is going and what you are doing in your day-to-day life is a huge thing for me. When I write a piece for my column, I truly believe that if people applied it to their life it would make a difference little by little.
Most people believe that whatever life they are born into is what they have to keep or that they have to prove to others their worth. Being happy with who you are and working hard on something you are passionate about is what truly leads to a happy life.
When my mom suddenly passed away when I was 14, it was a huge change in my life. After being upset, for a while I realized life is way too short to be nothing but happy and that you are in control of what you do with your life; so why not go after something you are passionate about and move out of your comfort zone.
If finding happiness throughout your life is something you want then go out and do the things you are afraid people will judge you on. The only one who should care about how you live your life is yourself and everyone else should support you. Don’t live your life for other people, you won’t nd your happiness within theirs.

The Student Activities Board revealed the Spring Fling 2018 performer during common hour on March 20, but does musician Jeremih meet the standards of the student body? 
Jeremih (Jeremy Felton) is an American R&B singer, producer and songwriter. He rose to fame in the late 2000’s with songs including “Imma Star” and “Birthday Sex.” The 30-year-old Chicago native will take the Tilles Center stage Thursday, April 19, 2018.
For many students, this spring concert marks the end of the school year, and for the graduating class, the end of their college career. LIU Post and the Student Activities Board have invited previously invited several renowned artists to perform including Jason Derulo, Kesha, and Sean Paul, in past years.
Students recently replied to an email survey from Campus Life to help gage of what sort of artist is most in demand from the student body. It included names like DJ Steve Aoki, country singer Hunter Hayes and pop icon Iggy Azela. The students were also asked if they preferred one main act or if they preferred and alternate set up.
“I’ve not heard of this artist before, but my friends are excited for the performance, so I feel like it’s going to be a great night,” Jackie Tonn, a senior nutrition major, said. Tonn seemed less than excited for the evening.
“I am a little disappointed, we spend a lot of money to go here. We should have someone big like Adelphi [Fetty Wap 2017],” Dianna Gonzalez, a junior education major, said. “It’s not 2008, it’s 2018.” The artist’s best known song “Birthday Sex” was released in 2009, and it peaked at number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in the same year.
Students in Hillwood Commons were abuzz after the reveal of the artist. Some played his songs through mini speakers while other jeered in disappointment. The concert will take place on April 19 at the Tilles Center at 8 p.m. Tickets are available for $5 at the Tilles Center box office from March 22 to April 5. All ticket proceeds go to Relay For Life.

The Tilles Center for Performing Arts and the music department will host the 14th Annual Band Festival from April 10-13. The event will combine the LIU Post Wind Symphony with nominated high school students. Dr. James McRoy, director of wind studies, and Mark Camphouse, the composer-in-residence for 2018, will conduct the performance.
There were 250 high school applicants from 42 schools in the New York metropolitan area, and McRoy and his staff selected 124 of these musicians to perform. The LIU Post Wind Symphony will perform alongside the wind ensembles from Bay Shore High School and East Meadow High School.
Camphouse is an external composer brought to work with the variety of students. The students’ repertoire includes two of his original works and two other pieces. Camphouse is a professor of music and the wind symphony director at George Mason University. He also teaches courses in composition and conducting.
This is his McRoy’s 20th year at Post, and having started this event in 2003, he is very excited for the growing magnitude of the festival. “It has grown every single year,” McRoy said. The event now involves over 300 musicians, “It’s intense work,” he said. McRoy also mentioned the importance this event holds for university recruitment since the students that participate are encouraged to consider the university for a higher education.
Brian Marcus, a junior music education major, will take part in this festival for the third time. He plays trumpet in the wind Ensemble, wind symphony, jazz ensemble, and the orchestra and is excited for his upcoming performance in the Band Festival. “There is nothing I look forward to more as a wind player than working for a week with and getting to know the composer of enormous works of art,” he said.
The festival is a great opportunity for participants, according to Marcus. Members of the ensemble get to meet new faces and work with outside composers, and the experience is inspiring for many of the young musicians. “Not often do players in orchestra and band get to work with the one who actually composed the piece they’re playing,” Marcus said, “They get nothing but the real deal, as a piece can be interpreted and played in so many different ways.”
WCWP radio will broadcast the event live. In addition, McRoy will conduct an interview with Camphouse to air in segments throughout the evening of April 13. The final performance is scheduled for Friday, April 13 at 8 p.m. in the Tilles Concert Hall. Rehearsals on April 10 and 12 from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. are open to the public, and it will be the first time the group of students will rehearse as an ensemble. Contact the Tilles Center box office at (516) 299-3100 to purchase tickets. Prices are $10 for general admission and $8 for seniors. Admission to the event is free for LIU Post students.

A young woman named Jean sits in a café and hears a man’s cell phone ringing at the table next to her. After listening to its endless ringing, she decides to find out why the man won’t answer his phone. That’s when she discovers that he is dead. Jean decides to answer the phone, and the journey that follows changes her entire life.
“Technology outlives us, all that is left are memories, and this cell phone that seems to be alive after he is gone,” Michaela Fox, a sophomore musical theater major and Mrs. Gottlieb, said. “It’s a satire on technology and our absorption with it,” she said.
The play, “Dead Man’s Cell Phone,” written by Sarah Ruhl, is directed by MFA student Chamila Priyanka. The small cast of six sophomore and junior musical theatre majors each play a large role in portraying a dark and comedic perspective on contemporary issues.
“I like the structure of the play. It’s not a realistic play, it’s kind of absurd,” Priyanka said. “It is a powerful artistic statement of the current society.”
Priyanka has directed four one-act plays at Post and a four-act play in his home country of Sri Lanka. “Dead Man’s Cell Phone” is his first time directing a full-length show.
Priyanka praises his cast for having many talents. “They have good training here. So it is very easy to work with them,” he said. The cast all helped with creating multiple elements of the performance, and they were heavily involved with contributing ideas, according to Fox. “It was just a bunch of creative minds working together,” she said.
“The collaboration is an essential part of this business,” Priyanka said. “My cast helped me so much when I rehearsed those scenes. Everyone gave me their ideas. It is amazing.”
“[Chamila] is really fun. It’s fun to watch him grow and develop as he learns things from us and we learn things from him,” Fox said about working with Priyanka. “He’s one of the better directors I’ve worked with here [at Post],” she said.
Priyanka hopes that the theme of the play reaches his audience. “This play is a kind of statement of current society. We are moving from the tangible world to the intangible world because of digital technology,” he said. “Our souls and bodies don’t want to be together anymore.”
Performances take place on the Little Theatre mainstage on Saturday, March 24, Wednesday, March 28, and Saturday, March 31 at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $15 for general admission, $12 for seniors, and $10 for students. They can be purchased at the Little Theatre box office or at www.tix55.com/ptc700/

Katie Humhej, a sophomore health science major from Surrey, British Columbia, pitched in her first home game of her sophomore year on Saturday, March 17 when she pitched all five innings against American International College. She had four strikeouts and only allowed one run.
In her current year, despite her 1-5 record coming into Saturday’s second game of their double-header, Humhej said, “ I think I just started to settle in to the feel of competing outside in a game again. We’ve been indoors practicing for so long due to the weather that sometimes the change can be difficult, especially in the cold weather.”
The softball team played eight games in Clermont, (Fla.) where she pitched in four of those games to begin its season. Humhej adjusted to the change in weather for the team’s home opener. “It was very difficult compared to pitching in warm weather,” she said. “we had to continuously keep warming up between innings to keep our arms going so that we wouldn’t stiffen up.”
Following junior health science major and sports management minor, Hannah Olshevski’s strong pitching performance in game one, Humhej’s exceptional pitching performance in the second game of Saturday’s double-header was able to help the Pioneers sweep American International College, give them a 2-0 record at home and improve her own record to 2-5.

With the baseball season in full swing, the Pioneers came back to Brookville to play their first home game on Saturday, March 17 after opening the season with 14 games away.
The first 14 games of the season were monumental for some players. Junior pitcher James Varela, was awarded East Coast Conference Player of The Week on March 12 after pitching all nine innings and striking out 12 batters against Franklin Pierce University on March 10 in Cary, North Carolina (N.C.) for the Pioneers. Junior infielder Jimmy Mendyk also had a game to remember on the road when he picked up four hits to aid in a win for the Pioneers against Dominican College on March 11.
Coach Michael Gaffney is pleased that the team has returned home after spending many weekends on the road. “We feel better about playing on our field, sleeping in our beds and leaving our suitcases unpacked, but the snow is our only wrinkle.” Even though the team travels to N.C. and S.C. to begin every season.
The Pioneers are the only Division II baseball team that still has a grass baseball field, which is now outdated. Fortunately, the Pioneers have the ability to use the fields at both Adelphi University and the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) in cases of inclement weather since turf fields are able to sustain their structure during bad weather unlike a traditional grass baseball field. Turf is safer for playing any sport since it doesn’t create puddles of water, which can lead to injuries.
As the team heads home, they’re sitting in eighth place in the East Region ranking after a 2-0 victory against Franklin Pierce University on March 10. However, at the beginning of the season, the Pioneers were in fifth place, so they dropped down three ranks. Gaffney commented on the team’s position, “We had a tough week in Myrtle Beach, but by the end of the year we’ll be in the top seven. I don’t put too much stock in it because it’s still early.”
The Pioneers will play their next game at home against the NYIT Bears on Friday, March 23.
