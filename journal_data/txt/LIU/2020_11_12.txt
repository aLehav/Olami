The Scottish actor Sean Connery has died at age 90 in his sleep. His career spanned for seven decades and he was best known for his portrayal of James Bond. 
Connery became a top box-office star in both Britain and the United States in 1965 after starring in “From Russia With Love,” “Goldfinger” and “Thunderball.” He would go on to star in seven of the Bond series films. More than Agent 007, Connery went on to play a widower obsessed with a woman who is a compulsive thief in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Marnie” and as an amoral poet in the satire “A Fine Madness.”
Throughout his career he acted in more than 60 movies, leaving behind a legacy that many believe will last forever. 
“He was an amazing actor and his continuations to the medium are astounding,” Senior marketing major Anthony Cavarretta said. “He taught us how to play it cool as Mr. Bond and he is one of the main reasons Indiana Jones and the last crusade is my favorite movie of all time.” 
Connery died in the Bahamas, surrounded by loved ones after feeling unwell for some time according to his son, Jason Connery. Connery’s wife, Micheline Roquebrune, would later add that he had struggled with dementia before his passing. 
Senior arts management major Brianna Savarino said ”He was a super talented actor. Everyone knows the line, Bond, James Bond.”

What seemed like just another normal week at lacrosse practice abruptly turned into one of the scariest moments of our lives, as a worldwide pandemic was on the verge of a massive breakout. As we were fully prepared to leave for Florida the next day to begin our spring break, everything went downhill in a matter of 24 hours. Our trip was canceled, and our season shortly after followed with a brief postponement for the spring till further notice. Subsequently, this turned into heartbreaking news as the word of our 2020 spring season as a new team had been canceled, as the Northeast Conference (NEC) Commissioner passed along her decision. Life as we knew it had changed, and everything around us was slowly starting to fall apart. Everything happened so fast that it felt like a bad dream we never would wake up from. The news was blasting information out about the pandemic, as one by one, each state started to shut down and would begin quarantine for as long as it was required for our safety. There were so many emotions that followed this drastic event, as I had to depart from my team and leave school in a matter of weeks. I was not sure how long this would last or when I would see my teammates again, but I did know that I was scared for what life was about to be.
Ever since I could remember, I have always had a lacrosse stick in my hand. Lacrosse has been such a huge part of my life ever since I was little and has influenced me in so many ways. Lacrosse has allowed me to build connections, make lifelong friendships, travel the world, and has helped me better understand what it is like to be a part of something bigger than just myself. Growing up being involved in lacrosse gave me so much to look forward to as it provided me with so much excitement. Furthermore, I knew moving forward into my future, I wanted to continue my lacrosse career for as long as possible and continue to further my education at a university. In doing so, I decided to continue my education and passion for lacrosse at the collegiate level as I committed to Long Island University. Upon arriving at LIU to play lacrosse, I knew this experience would be one to remember and would be different from what I was used to in high school. I was now about to enter a higher level of competition, and the demand for my sport would be more time-consuming. My freshman year was one that I could never forget. The experiences I had and the people I was able to play with were unlike anything else. That year we made it to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) game and unfortunately lost, but I knew the following year I would continue to give it my everything to make sure we returned back to the NCAA championships. Unfortunately, this was all put on pause, as the arrival of Covid ruined our future dreams. Now that the fall season is among us, we are now facing the same position we were in six months ago.
Even though it was heartbreaking, and came out of shock to all of us, this pandemic has affected me in more ways than one. I faced many challenges emotionally and mentally, as there were so many unknowns ahead of me. There was a piece of me that was lost after something that had been such a huge part of my life was just taken away in a blink of an eye. Knowing that a pandemic was taking place, I was worried about what the future would hold not only for my lacrosse career but also for my education. However, even though drastic changes have taken place, and the pandemic is still ongoing, it has allowed me to take a step back and truly appreciate my life for what it is. If it wasn’t for this pandemic, I would have never realized how much impact lacrosse had on my life. It made me realize that I took my sport for granted, and that was a mistake I would never make again. It has allowed me to work harder at practice, be a better teammate, and appreciate every second on the field more.

On Nov. 3, the nation went out and cast their votes to decide who will represent the United States of America for the next four years. 
Over the past several months, the 2020 presidential election has been an extremely anticipated and controversial conversation in the media. In these trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic, the people of America have been put to the ultimate test. Many social, economic and environmental issues have been brought to the table for the two presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump to debate throughout this election.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the many social and safety protocols put on our society, this 2020 presidential election was especially challenging and distinct. This election brought an historically large number of mail in ballots and early voters. This aspect of the election added to the media hype surrounding the entire event, and even brought out more voters to participate in the election than ever before. 
After many months of preparation, predictions and anticipation the time for American’s voices to be heard had come. At 6 a.m. eastern time the first polls were open and ready to go, they were up and running all day until 8 p.m. pacific time. Throughout the day, a record number of at least 161 million Americans came out to cast their vote for who they thought should be the next president of the United States. Both parties had record breaking turnouts at the polls, leading this election to be the largest number of voters in a US presidential election in history. Childhood and special education senior Katie Ginty was among the masses that attended the polls on election day. 
“I went to vote with my whole family, and seeing all people there was insane. Everyone was quiet and stayed to themselves really, but the line was especially long in my district because one of the voting machines had broken that morning,” Ginty said.
She continued “When the machine broke, it made it so that everyone in that district wasn’t able to cast their ballot so they were all sortta just standing there and were told they had to come back at another time.” Issues such as this were reported all across the U.S. certainly adding to the election day chaos. 
For this election day, many prognosis had been made by the media on what may or may not happen. After a year of shocking events, Americans were being prepared for anything and everything. Across the country, voters came out to show their support for their candidate of choice. Health education/physical education senior Cassie Zangerle was one of the many American who exercised their right on election day. 
“My family and I wanted to avoid the large crowds due to COVID-19, so we went to our local poll at a non optimal time and it worked out perfectly,” Zangerle said. “The line was maybe 10 minutes, so we went in and went out. The wait wasn’t bad either because other people on the line were being interviewed and asked about their experience so it was pretty cool.” 
She continued “Going into election day, I was pretty nervous because this was my first time voting in a major election like this and I just didn’t know what to expect really. But once I got signed in, everything was pretty self explanatory.”
In this election, nearly 6.2 million first-time voters came out to show their involvement in the American political system. Early on in the election, numbers like this were expected so poll volunteers and workers were prepared for added confusion and questions on election day so they were properly equipped with the necessary training and protocols to be of assistance. Criminal justice junior Emily Peralta was one of those that benefited from the helpful staff at her local poll. 
“This was my first time voting, so going into the whole experience I was mainly excited to be participating in a major election like this, but I was definitely nervous as well just because I didn’t know what to expect once I got in there,” Peralta said. “After waiting in line for two hours in the freezing cold, I finally got signed in and received my ballot. I was confused, so I just asked the poll worker and she was so helpful. They were all extremely attentive and accommodating, it really made the experience easier for me. After all that, I mainly felt excited. I was excited that as a minority woman, I got to participate in something like this. I was excited to have my voice heard.” 
Many Americans exercised their right to vote this election day, and many did not. It can be agreed that no matter how you spent your election day, the eager wait to hear the race results was agonizing and stressful for all Americans. After four days and many news reports later, on Saturday Nov. 7, Joe Biden was announced to be the projected winner of the election.

Men’s hockey will be the first team from the university to start playing on Nov. 14. Ever since athletics announced men’s hockey would be the newest sport on campus on April 30, they have been waiting on the coronavirus pandemic to start gameplay. The men’s hockey team will be playing in the Atlantic Hockey Association, and they will not be eligible to compete in the postseason, but they will take on some of the east coast’s best hockey programs. Atlantic Hockey announced it had separated the league into eastern and western pods to limit the spread of COVID-19. LIU joined as a scheduling partner with the Atlantic Hockey Association for the 2020-2021 season. They will play a two-game set with each team this year except for Air Force, who they will play for four games. While Atlantic Hockey is still working to finalize the return-to-play protocols for the season, LIU has agreed to abide by all protocols for the 2020-2021 season. 
On Oct. 2, the Northeast Conference Council of Presidents reaffirmed its July 29 decision to postpone fall sports athletics competition and championships no earlier than Nov. 25. After the NCAA moved fall championships to the spring, the NEC said it is continuing to evaluate the viability of providing a competitive experience in the spring semester. “This course of action now allows us to shift our attention to the future and work with campus leaders to examine the feasibility of potential competitions for fall, winter, and spring sports that support the well-being of student-athletes, staff and campus communities,” NEC commissioner Noreem Morris said. “I continue to be inspired by the resilience and determination of our student-athletes and look forward to the day they can once again play the game they love and experience the thrill of NEC competition.”
Head coach Brett Riley is excited about the upcoming season and to get the program up and running. “When they put the jersey on for our first contest, this will feel like a reality. Watching many of these guys achieve a lifelong dream of playing at this level will be a surreal moment, and seeing our transfers help upstart that moment will make it that much better,” he said. “Despite the times, it has been a period of milestone moments for our program that I’m very proud of.” Riley says they are approaching this season with a “something to prove mentality” and praises the team’s preparation. “I can tell you that this team has maximized every day and has not taken a day for granted regarding on and off ice training and preparation,” he said.
Garett Metcalf, a graduate student, talks about not wasting this opportunity he has. “During the summer months, I spent time working on goalie specific things. I found flaws in my game and tried to turn them into strengths,” he said. “I also continued to work on my strength in the gym and emphasized conditioning in the later months of summer.” Metcalf stated how being home in Colorado helped this offseason. “I was very fortunate to have private ice and a gym to work out. The pandemic had a minimal effect on my training,”  he said
Christian Rajic, a senior, states how COVID has made these fall practices different. “Being on campus, COVID has put some restrictions on what we can do. We started with small group workouts and skates, but now we are practicing as a full team, and it feels like things are starting to get back to normal,” he said. Despite the differences, he feels the team is ready to go and show what they can do. “We know there are going to be ups and downs for the first season, but the way we have prepared, I know we are ready to compete with any team we face,” he said. “I have a lot of confidence in this group and can’t wait to get things started Saturday.” LIU takes on Army West Point to start the season on Nov. 14.

Thanksgiving is a holiday for spending time with family and friends, giving thanks, and of course, sharing food with loved ones. With a heavy emphasis on food, Thanksgiving can be stressful for those trying to maintain certain health goals. Holidays often include rich, delicious food which sometimes leads to overindulging and straying from your normal diet. Unfortunately, this can lead to guilt for a lot of us, so we put together some helpful tips to help you stay on track while still enjoying the day. Planning ahead and paying attention to your hunger cues are going to make all the difference.
First things first, eat breakfast. Many people assume that skipping breakfast is the best way to cut down on calories on holidays, but it can actually lead to the opposite. Skipping meals can cause extreme hunger which can cause overeating later on in the day and leave you feeling like a stuffed turkey.
Now that it’s time to celebrate and eat, what should you do? Start by looking over all of the food options and aim for a balanced plate. Be sure half the plate is filled with fruits and/or vegetables, a quarter with protein, and a quarter grains. Do not let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. Decide which foods you would like to try, take a small portion of each and fit them into each section accordingly. Don’t be afraid to avoid some foods or not finish everything on your plate. If you are going for a second plate of food try to use a smaller plate or half the size of the original plate. Over the course of your full meal, it is important to listen to your hunger cues, eat slowly and take breaks to figure out if you are full or still hungry. You can do this by engaging in the conversation around the table and focusing on family instead of food. Another way to prevent overeating is to drink plenty of water throughout the day, or have some seasonal soup to help slow down your eating and fill you up. By listening to and eating according to your body, you can become full without overeating to the point of being uncomfortable.
Not sure if healthy foods are going to be available to you at your Thanksgiving meal? Don’t be afraid to whip something up yourself. Not everyone may have the same dietary preference as you, so bring your own dish so you will be sure to have something to enjoy. You can try making healthy substitutes of popular dishes like mashed cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes, or a vegetable and rice medley instead of stuffing.
Now that dinner is done, what should you do? Be active. After dinner is a great time to do a family activity such as going for a walk, taking a bike ride, or even tossing a football. Doing something active can help with digestion and give you more time in between dinner and dessert. Once it’s time for dessert, be sure to incorporate some of the same tips from dinner time. It is important to continue with portion control, bring your own slimmed down holiday favorites, and choose some healthier dessert options.
Thanksgiving is a time to spend with family, enjoy their company, and enjoy some food. Just remember everything in moderation. You do not have to deprive yourself of what you enjoy, or stress because you ate more than usual. Thanksgiving dinner is just one meal, it will not make or break you. So enjoy your meal, go back for some seconds if you’re still hungry, have dessert, enjoy this time with family and friends, and give thanks.

Joe Biden has secured 290 electoral votes as of Saturday, Nov. 7 and is projected to become the 46th president of the United States, defeating opponent and current president Donald Trump.
Many students celebrated Biden’s projected victory.
“I couldn’t be happier with the results,” freshman musical theatre major Lauren Mummert said. “This was the first election I could vote in and I was so worried about losing my rights as a queer woman, which is something I shouldn’t have to worry about. I know [Biden] isn’t perfect but he is leaps and bounds better than Trump.”
While the state voting requirements and ballot counting regulations indicated that the projected winner by popular vote and the electoral college would not be named on Nov. 3, students felt a lot of anxiety not knowing until Nov. 7.
“I was miserable waiting,” Mummert said. 
Mummert is from a republican majority state and felt nervous for the results and powerless due to the electoral college having the ultimate say in the presidency, but said that her program helped her through this time. 
“I’m lucky to be a musical theatre major because, being surrounded and taught by artists, we were all pretty scared for this election and were able to pause our instructions to make time to have open conversation,” Mummert said. “That sense of communal hope kept me going.”
Sophomore health sciences major Miranda Ruiz was astounded by the voter turnout this year, but was nervous for Biden to win the popular vote and not the electoral college vote. She was hurt by her home state of Texas because Trump won the most votes.
“I am disappointed in all the Americans who would stand with a racist, sexist man like Trump,” she said. “I would also like to say that I am disappointed that Texas was unable to fully turn blue, unlike Arizona and Pennsylvania, but it was amazing that it was tinted blue for such a long time during the election.”
Although students were happy to begin the process of removing Trump from office, they are weary of Biden’s campaign promises.
“I am worried that he is not going to get done as much as what this nation needs to heal,” Mummert said. “His slogan was to ‘build back better,’ and I think he will build the foundations for that. But I am still nervous that his policies aren’t progressive enough for the left and too progressive for the right.”
Biden’s running-mate Kamala Harris will be the first woman and first Black and Asian-American person to serve as vice president. 
“It’s about time,” Mummert said, although she claimed that Harris’ campaign ideas do not align with her own personal ideas for the country. “It shouldn’t have taken this long to elect a woman, let alone a woman of color, in such a high ranking for our country.”
Mummert is inspired by Harris’ accomplishment.
“[Harris] gives me the confidence to fight for what I want and show everyone around me what I can do,” she said.
Ruiz believes that Biden having a running mate who is a woman helped his campaign.
“It’s a beautiful moment in history and a step in the right direction to having more women in high positions of power,” Ruiz said.  “Like Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, ‘Women belong in all places where decisions are being made’.”
While Mummert experienced the stress and excitement of the election with other musical theatre majors, junior Isadora Petrovsky continued to urge students to vote.
“After I voted, all I felt I could do was encourage others to vote,” she said. “Even then, their agency was their own, as mine was. I felt I had done all in my power to influence the election, so I turned all reports of the election off for a while. I checked the stats a couple times, but I decided to just go about my daily life, as to not provoke additional anxiety.”
Petrovsky was pleased to learn that Biden and Harris have been projected to become the next president and vice-president.
“[I was] incredibly excited, I shed a tear when I found out. This is huge, I can’t wait for more,” Petrovsky said.
Trump has refused to acknowledge the loss and says that he will challenge any speculated fraudulency of ballots. The Trump campaign has launched multiple lawsuits in several states that so far have been unsuccessful in revealing voter fraud.
“It’s honestly so hypocritical and ridiculous,” Petrovsky said.
Both Petrovsky and Mummert believe that voter fraud is not a problem the election faced and that Trump’s cases will be dismissed but sophomore marketing major Jacob Shamah disagrees.
“I believe that Trump will not peacefully leave the office because of the illegitimacy of mail-in ballots,” he said. “A lot of people say it’s Trump making up lies, but a quote from a New York Post article regarding this subject says, ‘A top Democratic operative says voter fraud, especially with mail-in ballots, is no myth.’ And he knows this because he’s been doing it, on a grand scale, for decades.” 
Shamah believes that Trump will accept his defeat if he is still short on votes after the court cases.
“If the fraud is fixed in the mail-in ballot system, then I believe he will gladly leave office,” he said.
As of Thur. Nov. 5, judges in Georgia and Michigan dismissed Trump Administration cases regarding voter fraud.

The Model United Nations (UN) club, led by President Abigail Bossa, is in the process of reactivation. According to Bossa, the club was last active in 2016 and has just recently been revived. On Oct. 23 the club held their first meeting and are hoping to officially be recognized as an on-campus club later this November.
“Model United Nations is a club that stimulates the actual United Nations,” Bossa said. “Students represent delegates of different countries and debate political issues and international relations. In the end, everyone comes together to write a resolution solving the problem at hand.”
The Model UN club was originally disbanded due to low-activity but President Bossa and Vice President Sibani Polce are ready to change that. Model UN is prepared to hold bi-weekly meetings, Model UN workshops and more to the campus community according to Polce. 
“Anyone who is interested in joining the Model UN club should know that while we will strive to emulate the real United Nations, we are also here to support our fellow Sharks in any way possible, whether that is through public speaking workshops, current events debates, or something else we want people who are passionate about the world we live to be able to have a forum to discuss them,” Polce said. 
Model UN is actively accepting new members. Students interested in joining the club can follow their Instagram @liumodelun to stay up to date with their meetings and events.
“My favorite part of this club is the friendships and relationships that are made. Debating and attending conferences together really build bonds and allows us to form unforgettable memories,” Bossa said. “Due to COVID, we have not been able to travel and will be attending virtual competitions. However, traveling with the club is something that I am really looking forward to and hope that we can do soon.”

On Tuesday, Oct. 27, the art department hosted its fourth annual Halloween Art Show. This year, the show was titled “Postmortem: Astral Bodies.” The reception was held on Zoom from 12:30-2 p.m. Professor Laura Sweeney, a Post Alumni, hosted and organized the reception. The slideshow of the artwork was compiled by Kelcey Dilling, an art student at Post. The reception included students, alumni and faculty; students from Post, Suffolk County Community College and East Rockaway High School. There were over 70 pieces including paintings, drawings, photography, mixed media art, embroidery, sculpture and digital art. 
 There were five awards given out at the end of the show including first, second and third place as well as honorable mention and high school division. The winner of the high school division was Daniella Pedi for her artwork titled “What Lurks in the Dark,” Ink, 2020. The winner of Honorable Mention was Sara Halvorsen for her work titled “Michael Myers’,’ colored pencil, 2020. The third prize winner was Angraciela Scott for her work titled “Reborn within the Exosphere,” Digital, 2020. The second prize winner was Jenna Fisk for her piece titled “A lot of Tape,” mixed media, 2020.

Professor Winn Rea, the chair of the art department and the director of the studio foundation program attended the event. “This year, because of COVID, ‘Postmortem’ was a virtual Halloween exhibit. Sponsored by the Department of Art, this year’s show drew more participants than ever from a variety of majors, and even some ambitious area high school students,” Rea said. “It’s a great opportunity for artists to showcase their work—spooky or not. I want to extend a big thanks to Professor Sweeney who organized the show for the third year in a row and always makes it a fun event attending in her own cosplay outfits and encouraging everyone to show up in their favorite costume. The show lives on in a printed ‘zine version’ provided to all participants.”
