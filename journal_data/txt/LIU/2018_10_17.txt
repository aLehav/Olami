Five months ago I graduated and left LIU Post. And today I am agitated when I have to ask, what is left at LIU Post? Friends of mine, both alumni and current students, are in a constant state of unease. They have to ask questions such as, when will this school go bankrupt? Or why would anyone want to come here? These questions are not without merit, as it is clear that a university without universal leadership is doomed to fail.

Our students sleep in dorm rooms furnished with mold. Our professors are forced to consolidate departments, constantly doing more with less. Our athletes are thrown out. Our beautiful campus is marred with broken doors, windows, walls… etc. Our facilities workers are contracted out to the lowest bidder. Our custodians are contracted out to the lowest bidder. Our campus health service is cut. Our resident assistants and orientation leaders are paid less than panhandlers.
Our promise office is a revolving door, and is always asked to do more. And those who speak up are scolded.
I suppose these are matters of discretion. Our university’s leadership has chosen to prioritize remodeling theatres with board members’ names atop its doors. This is more important to them than remodeling a student cafeteria or even keeping clean dorm bathrooms.
Perhaps this is what we must accept. A leadership who is more interested in self, and not interested in students.
And I say that if this administration has a plan, if they are implementing it to improve our university. If they in fact know what they are doing. Then they must do. This administration must answer, not just to the board. Not just to those of a particular donor class. Not just to those of a particular department. But to all of the people at this university.
If they cannot accept this, then depart, we say, and let us have done with you.
This university, it’s programs, it’s traditions, it’s student morale and it’s identity have been stripped. The LIU Post I knew, and we all knew, has been shredded. So what remains at my LIU Post?
Sincerely,
Adam Hornbuckle
LIU Post (‘18) alumnus

While many students were enjoying a day without classes on Friday, Oct. 5, nine freshmen got to work for the community.
Every year, the freshman service learning project allows first years to give back to their community. For 2018, their project was updating the garden behind the Winnick Mansion.
Led by peer mentors Chana Hancox, sophomore business management major, and Destyn Harding, sophomore marketing major, as well as faculty advisors Dr. Shawn Welnack, professor of philosophy, Dr. John Lutz, professor of English and Ed Niemczura, adjunct professor of English, the freshmen weeded the garden and manicured the existing foliage.

“Beyond the pleasures of gardening, our project also aimed to encourage students to take responsibility for their surroundings,” Welnack said.
The point of the freshman year service learning project is “to better lives around us and ourselves,” Hancox said. More service projects are to come – the work on the garden was the first of many, although no specific other projects have been selected yet.
“For a few students, it was the first time they had done any weeding and cleaning up of an outdoor space,” Welnack said. “Although we could only provide a little taste of the pure pleasures that can come from working with and beautifying the land, our hope is that other occasions will arise for students, eventually leading them to fully appreciate such pleasures – and perhaps take up gardening on their own.”

Students worked with the campus grounds crew during the event, Welnack said.
“[The grounds crew] are an absolute delight to work with,” Welnack said. “They interact with the students, telling them about the various plants, flowers and weeds, hopefully both educating them, as well as forming more personal bonds between students and staff on campus.”

Dr. Stephen Tettelbach has been a professor of biology at LIU Post for 13 years. He previously taught at LIU Southampton for 19 years until that campus closed.
Since working at Post, Tettelbach has published 11 scientific papers, nine papers on bay scallops—two of which are on
reproduction, two on ecology of juvenile scallops, and five on restoration; and two papers on clams—one on reproduction and one on behavior. His two favorite papers described the huge increase in scallop populations and fishery landings that resulted from scallop restoration work. “Aspiring to an altered stable state: rebuilding of bay scallop populations and fisheries following intensive restoration,” one of the two papers, was published in 2015 in “Marine Ecology Progress Series” 529:121-136.
He was the co-leader of the most successful bay scallop restoration effort in the United States, in Orient Harbor, near the tip of the north fork of Long Island. “We have done free-plantings in the same bay, plus other bays and harbors in the Peconic Bay system,” Tettelbach said. Part of a $2.3-million Suffolk County-funded project put together by LIU and Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, the effort has, within five years, placed nearly five million scallops in East End waters, according to a 2010 Newsday report.
Tettelbach is also involved in the National Shellfisheries Association. He was treasurer for three years, then vice president for one year, president-elect for one year and then president for one year.
Although he is no longer an officer of the association, he has been a continuing member for forty years.
During his time as a professor, Tettelbach had helped obtain over $5 million in externally funded grants. He received the David Newton Teaching Award, the highest teaching award at LIU, while he taught at the Southampton campus.
Tettelbach enjoys his position as a professor, but it wasn’t always his dream to teach. He did not want to be a professor until he taught his first class after receiving his Ph.D. “That first class was an epiphany for me – I found my calling,” he said.
The obstacles and challenges he has faced are far outweighed by the benefits of teaching. His goal is to make sure his students are engaged and interested in the material. “I try to convey my sincere enthusiasm for the subjects I teach to my students. I keep my classes informal and try to make learning fun. When I teach labs, I get students outdoors as much as possible so they can experience things first hand,” Tettelbach stated.
He enjoys working with college students and treats his students like adults. “Working with college students, I think has helped keep me young at heart,” Tettelbach said. An outdoors person who enjoys spending time on boats or scuba diving, he finds that teaching students about biology also keeps him connected with nature.

The Campus Nutritionists hosted a World Food Day on Oct. 16 during common hour “to provide education about sustainable living, emphasizing minimizing food waste,” Sarah Schuette said. “They will provide smoothies, which are a great opportunity to use food scraps to reduce food waste, nutrition trivia with prizes and recipe ideas.”
The four campus dietetic nutritionist interns for the fall semester are Sarah Schuette, Christopher Shaw, Patricia Pauyo and Gabriela Barreto. They are located within the Center For Healthy Living in the back of Post Hall.
“The Campus Nutritionists are part of the LIU Post Dietetic Internship, a certificate program for those with a BS in Nutrition who want to become Registered Dietitians. The difference between a “nutritionist” and “registered dietitian nutritionist” is that a nutritionist is someone who has taken at least one nutrition course, whereas a registered dietitian nutritionist has completed an accredited undergraduate nutrition program, completed an accredited dietetic internship, and has passed the registered dietitian exam,” Schuette said.
“We’ve been giving away a lot of smoothies, and talking about the best way for you to store your food and make the most of your groceries, and lots of people are playing our games and winning prizes,” Schuette said. Some of the prizes are LIU paraphernalia, as well as food like Boomchickapop popcorn and Kind bars.
The smoothies are made of bananas and blueberries, and are divided into dairy and non-dairy. For the dairy, there is “some nice protein-ilicious Greek yogurt.”
The spinning wheel was run by executive board members of the club: James Boddman, a senior and the president of the club; Alecia Miguel, a senior and the public relations person; Kiersten Plut, a junior and the vice president; and Maggie Schulz, a senior and the fall committee chair.
“A lot of people walked over, won some prizes. Not that many people know all the answers to the questions, but we’re glad that they’re participating,” Schulz said. “They’re finding out about things that they didn’t know about.” One new thing they learned is the need to consume more grams of carbohydrates than grams of protein.

Over summer 2018, discussions were held to merge the music department with the theatre, dance and arts management department. The merger has not been completed and is still under consideration.
Dr. James McRoy, director of the wind symphony and professor of music explained his perception of the proposed change. “We weren’t told anything official; we had been told that it’s tentatively on hold,” he said. “We don’t really know what the play is moving forward or how things are going to unfold,” McRoy said.
Dr. Jennifer Miceli, the chairperson of the music department, stepped down at the end of the spring 2018 semester. The music department is currently without a chair and is being led by a committee. With only four full time faculty members in the department, the department has been put under some stress. “There’s a lot more email traffic as every decision has to go through multiple people, but we’re trying to make the best of it and try and let it not impact the students as much possible,” McRoy said.
McRoy sees the potential perks of the change for two highly accredited programs. Through unifying under the same chairperson and becoming a “performing arts” department that encompasses dance, music and theatre, McRoy said all three departments could have a chance to grow. “We’re hoping that a combined department of the performing arts would be able to create a department of more full time faculty in total,” he said. “And be able to represent the performing arts on campus as a more united front.”
In order for this to be a success, the departments need more resources, according to McRoy. The music department currently does not have a secretary, which he said is “challenging,” but faculty members are trying to operate as smoothly as they can given their circumstances. The long time department secretary, Emily Cintron, retired at the end of the spring semester.
This unification could benefit both departments when it comes to recruiting new students. The theatre and music programs can recruit at the same events, and this unification would give the combined department the chances to broaden their search for prospective students.
“Initially there would be one chair of the larger department of performing arts, on top of music, theatre, dance and art management,” McRoy said. “When we go out and recruit, we can do it as a more unified operation.”
Although the merger was a summer rumor, students have not received any definitive announcement.
Sophomore theatre major Emily Shoup explained that
it was mentioned in her class group chat over the summer, but they hadn’t heard anything since. “I don’t know how to feel about it because I don’t know enough yet,” Shoup said. “I guess unifying makes sense, when you think back to high school, the two departments were usually in the same building and usually worked very close together.”
“It’s tragic that the school is cutting funding and education in the arts and lumping music together with an entirely different field,” Katherine Keaney, senior theatre production major, said. “Let students study and hone their craft in their rightful environment. Don’t strip that away from students that are paying thousands of dollars to come here.”
Post is undergoing several changes as of fall 2018, and if approved, this unification will be another adjustment to which the students, faculty and administration will have to adapt.

The Horizon Festival is back and more dynamic than ever for the fourth time. Forza is an open-world car racing game series developed by Playground games. Gameplay takes place in a fictional version of the United Kingdom.
The Forza series started in 2005 with, “Forza Motorsport,” which gave gamers what could be the most realistic driving experience a video game could offer without having the player having to move from their couch to their car.
The Horizon titles started in 2012 and were designed to be appealing to younger gamers via the Horizon Festival. It resembles a mix between a music festival and the Monaco Grand Prix.
“Forza Horizon 4” is different from the previous installments, and the biggest change is the weather. Every few days the seasons will change from autumn, winter, spring and summer, which completely changes the gameplay. For example, in the summer, the road has more traction, allowing the player to drive the McLaren Senna, a rear-wheel drive supercar that can be difficult to handle when turning at high speeds.
With the Forza games, car tuning is close to realistic, but this year, game creators added in something that fans have wanted for years, drift tuning. Previously, players would use an older model car and turn it so the rear end of the car oversteers, causing a satisfying alternative to turning on a road. “Forza Horizon 4” includes drift tuning components such as drift suspension and wider tire axles.
Unfortunately for the new installment, a story not present. It is not really clear what the player’s objective is. Players can access specific types of races such as rally, street, drag and more to get to a showcase event, but that’s basically it.
Another issue is the new character customization; if the player gains a certain amount of points, they unlock a prize wheel spin. Prizes are great, but in the game, odds tend to end up winning a useless hat for the character to wear instead of a more desirable Ferrari 512 Testa Rossa. The worst part about this game is that players cannot control what season they’d like to play in; currently, the game is in winter and is transitioning over to spring, which means that the roads will be wet and less appealing to look at.
“Forza Horzion 4” is a good game, it’s relaxing to drive around in and enjoy the scenery of the United Kingdom, but there’s not as much thrill in this game as compared to the last three games.

This is a cute, quick craft to start the spooky season off. You’ll only need a spoon, two tissues, a rubber band or hair elastic, and a pen (to add as much detail as desired).
First take the spoon handle facing up, and scrunch up the first tissue into a ball on the end of the handle.

Next, take the second tissue, wrap it around the first and secure with hair elastic around the stem of the spoon.
Here’s the creative part. Draw what ever face, detail, or design you want for your spooky tissue ghost.
These can be used to eat pudding, stir your coffee or even placed in plant pots outside the house for some cute spooky decor.

“Human maturity: this means rediscovering the seriousness we had towards play when we were children,” Nietzsche.
As people age, the idea of play sometimes becomes distorted, and we lose sight of the joy that we once found while playing as children. When you think of playing as a kid, it was effortless. We grabbed our toys and let our imagination take over.
As time goes on, we tend to let life get in the way; society has a pretty strict viewpoint on how
we behave and which activities are appropriate for adults. Because of this, some adults feel uncomfortable or fear that they will look silly playing.
For example, when students look at their professors they only see them in a certain setting. Usually, the professors have a serious position when they are teaching, but the students wonder if that is how they always behave. How do their professors act when they are out for drinks with their friends? Do they spend their weekends doing nothing but grading or do they make some room for fun things to do? I understand that when you are at school it is, according to society, appropriate for professors to behave professionally but why not enjoy your job and have fun doing it?
Most of us abandon the possibility of ever playing again as we grow older, which is unfortunate. Play gives us a sense of freedom, creativity, and a burst of joy. When you are older you start to limit what you can do because everything needs to have a purposeful motive and can’t be improvised. Everything to adults, for the most part, has to have a goal or a point. We don’t allow for activities that can simply bring us joy.
Life is too short to live without play. Take of step back from your life for a short period of time where you can allow yourself to give in to spur-of-the- moment activities. Instead of only taking work and everyday life so seriously, try looking at play with the same seriousness. Some people look back on their childhood as their better days, so give yourself the brief happiness of playing once again.

The World Population Review states that there are approximately 7.75 million people living on Long Island’s 1401 square miles, including Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk. Nassau and Suffolk alone have a population of almost 3 million. This can be compared to the 976,000 people living in the 500 square miles of Westchester County. There are about seven times the amount of people living on a landmass that’s only three times greater than the number of people on it.
Naturally, where there are more people, there’s more pollution. While a majority of people are aware that pollution plagues the island, most are unaware of what actually causes it. Because earth is filled with an abundance of limited natural resources, it’s important that we live our lives conscious of what individual carbon footprint we leave behind and that we skew our daily and political choices towards preservation.
There are five main environmental contributors to the demise of the ozone layer. They include particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10, ozone, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. The number next to the particulate pollution refers to the size of the particle in micrometers. As a reference, an average strand of hair is 70 micrometers large, making these small particles breathable and able to actually enter the bloodstream. Sources include vehicle emissions, construction sites, coal burning and tobacco smoke.
While particulate 10 is larger and less invasive to the body, it’s just as common in the environment and is a major byproduct of power plants, road paving and wildfires. Studies done by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in London have concluded that individuals who live near roadways, construction zones and manufacturing plants have a much higher rate of lung disease and asthma than those deep in the suburbs. The reason being is that these particles, as well as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, travel for miles, making location a significant factor in determining risk of respiratory issues.
Sulfur dioxide is a gas mainly responsible for producing the grey/brown fog often seen in the morning and on hot summer days. Sources of this gas include gas stations, wood burning, dry cleaners and most significantly, diesel-fueled machinery. Nitrogen oxide, is a byproduct of burning coal and of car exhaust. Finally, ozone.
Ozone is a chemical byproduct of the reaction between UV rays and nitrogen oxide. The ozone layer is a protective atmospheric layer that buffers earth from UV rays and other cosmological influences. However, when ozone begins to form on the ground, it becomes toxic and makes the air thick, heavy and filled with man-made and natural particles that are harmful to health.
You may have heard of the term smog when learning about pollution. Smog is a term from the early twentieth century as a result of increased industrialization. It blends the words “fog” and “smoke” and is a thick, hazy layer that settles low in the atmosphere. Smog impacted populated places such as NYC and LA and caused increased rates of respiratory illnesses at the burst of industrialization. There have been many improvements in regulations, but recent policies have steered away from environmentalism and towards practices that increase pollution emission.
It’s ultimately in our hands to be the change that pushes the world towards preservation. Making educated political choices and choosing politicians who value the environment can help propagate change. Also, choosing to drive low emission vehicles, carpooling, and informing companies of inefficiently operating diesel fuel trucks are all things that we as Long Islanders have the power to do and should take responsibility for. Take the initiate when you see opportunities to improve the environment and treat the earth as if it’s your very own home, because it is.
