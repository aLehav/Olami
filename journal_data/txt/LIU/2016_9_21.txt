The first issue of The Pioneer was created on Sept. 21, 1956. This year, we celebrate the 60th anniversary. Each of the covers seen on the front page spread are archives from the first issue in 1956 as well as each decade after, leading us to present day.
Over these 60 years, The Pioneer has changed quite a bit, from the layout, the use of online technology as a media platform, to the coverage of hard news; The Pioneer has been dedicated to serving the LIU Post community with knowledge and the ability to showcase all the events that have taken place over time.

College campuses are full of clubs and activities that help students uncover culture and experiences. This is a trend at all universities, where students are always encouraged to join clubs, even start them. That is exactly what Sharon Sextus, a senior marketing major, decided to do. Sextus has a passion for Bollywood dancing, and her passion led her to start a Bollywood Dance Club.
“When I was looking for universities, dance clubs, especially Bollywood dance clubs, were definitely on my check list,” Sextus said. “When I found LIU-Post I instantly fell in love with the campus but the lack of a Bollywood dance club did not go unnoticed.”
Sextus and her friend, Neha Narvekar, a senior speech pathology major, started out competing in talent shows on campus where they won first and second place. It proved that the students definitely had a good response to the dance, and form there, LIU Post NAACH began.
Sextus is the president of this new club; Narvekar is the vice president. Other board members are senior Sana Zahra as the Treasurer, and senior Ridda Zahra as the secretary. Sextus has trained for two years in Bharatanatyam, Bhangra and has taken several Bollywood classes. She also instructs private clients for special events.
Narvekar has trained in Kathak since the age of 8, alongside having participated in various dance competitions as a child. She also teaches her friends and family on occasions.
Meanwhile the Zhara sisters, “dance for fun”. They may not have training but they do have a passion, they say.
They are all excited about the new club and hope to find a non- profit organization to which all proceeds they collect over a period of time can be given. “We want to give people an understanding of the movements and what Bollywood dancing is all about initially, which is why we want to start off as a club rather than a team,” Narvekar said. “We want to spread the culture, and make it even more vast than it already is at the LIU Post campus.”
Sextus added, “We want to start off with simple things like Bhangra and a Hip-Hop/Bollywood fusion. This way the movements aren’t too drastically different for people who want to learn. Later, however, we would like to incorporate little bits of Kathak and Bharatanatyam, which are classical Indian dance forms.”
The meeting space is still undetermined. All the places are either full, or already rented out all over campus, and this has them a little worried. “The place we currently or potentially have has no mirrors! How do we dance without mirrors?” Sextus said.
The girls are, however, trying their best to make arrangements so that they can at least get the club up and running. The girls have opened up the sign-up sheets for anyone interested. About fifteen members are ready to give it a try, mirror or not.
“We are a little concerned with how many people will turn up at the club, and how fast it will grow,” Sextus said. “No one has tried a Bollywood dancing club on campus yet and the whole culture is so new and different, we feel like people might not even be willing to give it a proper try.”
She, and the other Board members, hope it is a success and aim to perform at the Pep Rally this year on campus. “We have a bunch of great ideas if this turns out to be a success! We are sure it will be and hopefully we can put together a fundraising event soon where we’d be able to invite dance teams from other campuses and have some sort of dance off,” Sextus said.
“So many other universities have legitimate Bollywood dance teams that compete against other colleges. It’s like a sport, and I really want LIU-Post to be a part of that community,” Sextus added. “We want everyone, not just Indians, to be a part of this dance community and reach out to people with similar interests. Plus, it would be so much fun!”
“As a student I feel like this would be a great experience, and I’d be willing to give it a try, provided that the people in charge or teaching know what they are doing and how to do it because that would take away from the fun of it,” said Maya Mariner, a sophomore majoring in psychology.
Narvekar and Sextus have already started on the choreography for the first meeting that they intend to have in the coming week.
LIU Post NAACH is on social media for those who want to stay updated with the activities. They are on Instagram @liupost_naach and are also on Facebook as LIU Post Naach. They have a signup form for anyone who is still interested in joining. Sextus is in high hopes that the club will form into a strong community that she can then create into a team.

The First Year Service Experience (FYSE) allows incoming freshman to live on campus before classes start and participate in a weekend of service-related activities. This year, a handful of students, mostly incoming freshman but also a handful upperclassmen, participated in this program, Sept. 2-4.
Their adventure began in the basement of Youth Social Services Organization (YSOP) headquarters in Manhattan, an organization that sets up volunteer opportunities in cities such as New York and Washington D.C. Participants were divided into groups and traveled to four unique places of service: an urban farm, two different soup kitchens, and a food pantry.
Now the question is how a weekend of community service with unfamiliar schoolmates not only may change your life, but also be a gateway into college?
People volunteer for various reasons. Having a group of similarly minded people can allow for lasting friendships and connections to form. “You are able to get to know new people while being proactive in the community,” said Chris O’Connell, a sophomore film major who has participated in the program for the last two years. “It definitely made my transition into my first year easier, and the opportunity to provide that same experience to other freshmen was too good to pass up.”
FYSE 2016 gave incoming freshman worried and overwhelmed about making new friends the chance to overcome those fears, even before classes started, through interaction with the upperclassman participating in the program with them.
Not only did the opportunity allow for people to learn more about their classmates and their communities, but also learn about themselves. “I really just realized how much I had in my life and it made me feel as though I owed the world a favor,” said Kayla Bernie, a junior theatre design and production major.
Amanda Johnson, a freshman music education major who participated this year, recognized “how just a little bit of my time can impact someone so greatly.” Johnson was previously very active in her community and she applied this concept to her experience during FYSE. Similarly, Allie Michaelis, also a freshman music education major who participated this year, explained how “going to a soup kitchen opened my eyes to a whole new community of people.”
In addition to the four exclusive trips on Sept. 3, the next day brought its own adventures to the group. Divided into two groups, the students visited a nursing home and colored with the residents. To finish up the weekend, they ended their experience by making beds for shelter dogs.
FYSE is a program that runs every Fall semester for incoming freshman. Upper classmen who are interested should go to Campus Life and see the coordinator, Arianna Livreri, who is also in charge of all the service opportunities on campus. It is a free program that requires no out-ofals during the weekend of the program.
There is an upcoming event that is an extension of this program on Nov. 13. The event, coordinated by Livreri, will be a trip to The Virdone House, one of the nursing homes for mentally disabled adults. Students will be coloring and socializing with the residents. Contact Arianna Livreri in Campus Life to check for availability.
The Office of Campus Life did not respond to the Pioneer’s requests for comment about the school’s community service programs.

It’s almost time for Americans to get a front row seat and watch the two major party candidates duke it out on stage. On Monday, Sept. 26, at 9 p.m. we will all see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in their first head-to-head debate. The debate will consist of six segments of approximately 15 minutes each. The moderator of the debate, Lester Holt, will select a different topic for each of the 15-minute segments and will open them with a question directed at both candidates. The debate will be televised on major news networks in addition to CSPAN, hosted by Hofstra University.
It’s doubtful that Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson will find himself at the podium on the 26th as he has failed thus far to meet the requirements. The Commission on Presidential Debates requires that a candidate must be polling at 15 percent in at least five national polls to be given a spot on stage during one of the debates. Currently, Johnson has failed to consistently find himself above 10 percent, but is still fighting to have a 3rd podium on stage. Green party candidate Jill Stein is also not expected at the debate, as she finds herself trailing Johnson with less than 4 percent of voter support.
So we know when the debate will be and who to expect there, but do we know what to expect from the candidates in attendance? You can rest assured that the exact responses from the candidates will be very similar to their stump speeches, and on that front, we won’t hear much new or exciting.
What will be interesting to see will be the candidates’ rhetoric and how they formulate their attacks on their opponent. This debate is, of course, coming at a time when Hillary is defusing questions about her health and Trump is rebranding his campaign with new leadership and transitioning to a new approach.
“The Trump campaign has been trying to relaunch the candidate as a calmer, more presidential sounding version of himself,” said Jeremy Buchman, a professor in the Political Science department. “The first debate will tell us much about whether the effort was successful. I’m expecting a conflict less suited for a podium than for the UFC octagon.”

A Message from Debbie Smiloff De Louise
Pioneer, Class of ’89
I was a writer, features editor, and secretary on The Pioneer from 1983 until I graduated C.W. Post in 1989. I came to Post as a slightly “older” student who returned to college after working a year as a secretary. I enrolled part-time as an English major to test the waters before I made the full-time commitment.
One of the first things I did was trying to find a way to become involved on campus. I remember walking down the second floor corridor of Hillwood Commons to the activity wing where The Pioneer newspaper office was located. Adam Pardonek, the Editor-in-Chief at that time, spoke to me in his office about my interests in working for the student newspaper. I explained my situation as a new student who had prior experience as a secretary and also enjoyed writing. He suggested that my skills could be put to good use because many of the writers and editors needed help having their stories typed. There was also an opening for a features writer on that year’s paper. I accepted both positions.
My part-time job as secretary was approved by the administration, and I was paid a small wage. The workload sometimes became intense, especially close to deadlines. At that time, I used WordPerfect to input the stories into a computer. Unlike today’s technology, the paper’s layout was done in-house, in a production room, and brought to a printer for copying. My memories of production night dinners on Wednesdays are still clear after all these years. The advertising manager had an agreement with the local Fireside restaurant where the editors could have dinner each week in exchange for advertising copy in the paper. We all looked forward to these meals. Thinking back about eating with the editors as we discussed our stories, I can still taste the fried mozzarella sticks and recall the camaraderie and some of the jokes that were told. We celebrated staff birthdays and other occasions, too.
I still have my desk plaque that reads “Debbie Smiloff” and fond memories of my time on the Pioneer. I also received a special award for my feature writing my first year on the paper: the Lawrence C. Lobaugh, jr. Memorial Award in Journalism. Along with a plaque that is displayed in the Admissions building, I was given an engraved medal. The award had been given in memory of a man whose son had worked on the Pioneer and died much too young. It was quite an honor to receive this award, and I have treasured the medal for 33 years.
I saw many editor-in-chiefs come and go after Adam, who graduated that year. I moved up to features editor and was in charge of that section and the group of writers who contributed articles for it. I worked for Tim Votapka, Janice De Freitas, Valerie Kellogg and Raymond Jasen, and I also came to know the other staff members, editors and writers. Through my interviews for feature articles, I also met professors, students and school administrators. The experience I gained from working on the paper led me to publishing articles in magazines, and, after I married, I published a few books as well.
My first published novel, “Cloudy Rainbow,” actually features some chapters that take place at The Pioneer. My current book, “A Stone’s Throw,” includes a librarian, like myself, who is a Post graduate from the Palmer School. One of the book’s settings is in Brookville, where C.W. Post is located.
Many people say that college is the best years of one’s life. I agree. Even though classes can be tough and there are many additional stresses as one faces impending adulthood, the opportunity for friendships and extracurricular experiences such as those I gained from The Pioneer, cannot be duplicated. I look back on those days and the person I once was and realize how much my participation at the paper made a difference in my life.
I am also happy that, as the Internet and social media have developed ways of staying in touch, I have been able to reconnect with some of my fellow Pioneer friends. Over the summer, I did a book signing at the Levittown Library and was pleasantly surprised when Mike Gannon, a previous Sports Editor on The Pioneer, dropped by. He saw my Facebook post about the event and wanted to surprise me. It was the highlight of my day.
I believe the bond formed among Pioneer alumni remains strong despite time and distance because of the special experiences we shared on the paper. Not all the times were happy or fun, but we were all in them together. We worked to create a product that served the entire campus body. We were proud of our individual achievements but also realized it was a team effort.

“What pissed you off today?”
That’s the kind of question representatives from Young Ameri- cans for Liberty, a national organization, will be asking students during their first Liberty Dinner Wednesday, Sept. 28, at 7:30 p.m.in the Great Hall.
According to Pooja Bachani, the chapter president and founding member of the new club, YAL received approval (on a probationary basis, which is mandatory by Post programming for all new clubs on campus) from the school’s former programming specialist, Cheyenne Oberther (who resigned over the summer), on June 16, establishing it as an official club on campus.
“I had this great conversation with Cliff Maloney [CEO of YAL], Ty Hicks [National Field Director of YAL], and CJ Simpson [Former Director of Free speech] who told me about starting a YAL chapter at Post,” Bachani said. “I loved the idea, and so this is YAL. We believe in free speech. All I want to do is promote a space for the students, by the students, to come together as a community and just talk.”
Despite its new status, the group attracted 66 new members during the Campus Involvement Fair on Sept. 8.
Domonique Edwards, a junior business major, is one of the 66 students who signed up. “The giant beach ball made me curious,” Edwards said. “It made me want to find out more about YAL. I’m joining because I have a lot to say, and this is a great platform to allow me to speak my mind.”
According to the YAL organization website, it was founded in 2008, and is one of the fastest-growing pro-liberty organizations on America’s college campuses. A flyer, handed out by group members during the fair, said, “What are we about? Freedom! Liberty! Free Speech! Toleration!”
Bachani, who will be graduating in May 2017 with a masters degree in adolescent education in English, is motivated to educate her community on the importance of free speech.
“What does it mean to have free speech on a campus?” Bachani said. “I’m going to be honest, I didn’t know about this until I sought to learn it, and that, in turn, is what I would like to do for my community. How can we talk about it, if we don’t know what it means? How can we create a discussion about it in a community, without knowing what the community thinks?”
LIU Post is now among 700 YAL chapters across campuses nationwide that are focused on promoting and protecting free speech on campuses. “Roughly 93 percent of schools maintain unconstitutional speech codes,” according to Katie Barrows, communications director of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education). “Additionally, students are starting to demand censorship of ideas that make them uncomfortable, which has resulted in a campus climate that is very hostile to free speech.” Both FIRE and YAL are ready to protect college students.
“From letters to lawsuits, FIRE defends student and faculty members when their rights have been violated,” Barrows said. “FIRE also rates campus policies on how well they protect free speech and works with students, faculty members, and administrators to reform speech codes.”
Students, like Kylie Garret, a junior broadcasting major, understand the importance of having an organization such as YAL on campus. “Students should always have the ability to voice their opinions openly and freely,” Garett said. “College is a marketplace for ideas, so administration shouldn’t try to censor what we say. I’m glad there’s an organization on campus ready to reform speech codes if necessary.”
Other students like Fatima Coleman, a freshman criminal justice major, wonder if having a free speech club will leave room for hate speech.
“I would love to join this club, but what if people say discriminatory or hurtful things during the meetings? I know the first amendment protects hate speech, so wouldn’t a free speech club have to do the same?”
Bachani understands students’ concerns about being in such an open environment.
“One thing that is asked of members and students entering the Liberty Dinner is to be respectful,” Bachani said. “Inherent in the tenant of free speech is acknowledging that there is a variety to free speech, and there is no limitation. Hate is not welcome, however you have the right to express your feelings, and I have no right to tell you not to because that would contradict my stance on free speech.”
Bachani encourages students to join. “Free speech matters because it will affect you for the rest of your life.”
Students who join YAL can expect monthly Liberty Dinners—free food in exchange for your thoughts on freedom, film screenings, guest Lectures, conferences, and opportunities for leadership & national internships.
YAL stresses that members are not obligated to come to every meeting, and will have a lot of opportunity for growth through leadership opportunities within the organization.
“It’s not obligatory, Bachani said. “You can come whenever you want. This is not meant to be a strain on your schedule. So, what pissed you off today? Let me give you some food, and let’s talk about it.”
For more information about YAL, you can contact Bachani directly at Pooja.Bachani@my.liu.edu, or you can visit the chapter website using this link: http://www.yaliberty.org/chapters/ long-island-university-c-w-post-campus

Since April 1946, a woman with a commitment and love for higher education has played an active role in the affairs of Long Island University, from negotiating the purchase of the C.W. Post campus in 1947 to becoming the university’s first Chief Financial Officer.
She is referred to as the “Mother of the University” by former University President David Steinberg. Her dominance in LIU affairs still holds today, as she celebrates 70 years with the University. This woman is Mary Lai.
From the start of Lai’s long career at Long Island University, she has proven her commitment, hard work ethic, and extreme care for the University. Her years at LIU began with her decision to attend the LIU Brooklyn campus for college in the fall of 1938. “I was on a scholarship at Long Island University, when scholarships were only based on merit,” Lai said. At that time, scholarships were only given to the top students, she explained.
Although Mrs. Lai had received scholarships to other colleges such as New York University, Long Island University was the college for her. She chose LIU because it started in September, unlike the other colleges that started in January. In addition, Long Island University offered classes in the summer, making it ideal for her.
Shortly after her graduation from college, Mrs. Lai began to learn about public accounting. In many of her jobs, she was the only woman in the office. “When I went to IBM school in 1960, there were 54 people from higher education and I was the only woman,” she said. However, this didn’t deter her. “Being the only woman didn’t bother me because I was doing my job.”
Esther Cho, senior director of the LIU IT program management office (PMO), said that Mrs. Lai is an inspiration for women. She admires her for everything she has accomplished, including caring for her children.
“Mrs. Lai embodies what is possible for all women who put their minds to it and she inspires me to try harder every day and to make every moment count,” Cho said.
Mrs. Lai opened the doors for women who came after her, including Dr. Kimberly Cline, the current President of Long Island University, who is the university’s first female president.
In March 1946, Mrs. Lai was offered a position at LIU. She explained that, “At first I was hesitant to take the job as bursar, because I learned so much in public accounting.” But she felt that “[she] owed the university something for having had a scholarship and [she will] help [them] out, and come for a year.” And just like that, the empire of Mary Lai at LIU began.
“I put so much of myself in that [first] year. We went from 800 students to 5,000 in one year…. I got so involved in it. I couldn’t give it up… LIU became my baby,” she said.
Peggy Riggs, the university’s academic budget affairs officer, said that “her intelligence has always been present in her life and she used it to improve other people’s lives, especially the lives at LIU.”
Mrs. Lai explained that, “necessity is the mother of invention. I would find ways that would save [the university] money, [in- cluding] getting loans at inexpensive rates.”
Mrs. Lai dedicated so much of her time to LIU that she says, “there isn’t a piece of paper here that isn’t mine; there isn’t any procedure that isn’t mine.” She helped sculpt the LIU that is known today. Mrs. Lai explained that, “having been a student at LIU, I wanted it to be a better place, so I was working hard to make it better.” Riggs agrees. “The first word that would come to my mind would be dedicated. She’s dedicated to LIU,” Riggs said.
Mrs. Lai said that her favorite part of LIU is “[getting to] see the students when they graduate. They mature in those four years and it’s wonderful to see. The parents are so happy and it’s such a happy time.”
Lai has even attended freshmen registration. “I always worked at registration because I would be able to meet the students as they came in,” she said. She explained that “the work we do is to help the student achieve their goal and the student’s goal is graduation.”
Mrs. Lai has mentored and helped so many LIU administrators. “Mrs. Lai built relationships,” Cho said. “It wasn’t about the project all the time…She built relationships across the university.”
Linda Noyes, associate controller for compensation operation and Tax Compliance, said, “If I needed any information on anything, she was the source. She helped me get a better understanding of how LIU worked and because of this initial relationship she has always been very kind to me during my eleven years here.”
Mrs. Lai has received numerous awards and she is the founder of the National Association of College and University Business Officers. She has paved the way for LIU students for the past 70 years. Into her 90’s, she continues to contribute to the university in so many ways.
Thank you, Mary Lai.

Over the summer from Aug. 15-26, 11 students took part in a class called Figure Painting with Mixed Media taught by Professor Seung Lee, director of fine arts. Their work was showcased at the SAL Gal- lery, located on the first floor of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library from Sept. 6-10, and Sept. 13-17.
Lee has been teaching the summer class for eight years. Nancy Noskewicz, a Studio Art major in the second year of her Master’s program, who took the course, explained its focus.
“During Seung Lee’s class we had the opportunity to create figure-drawing artworks focusing on the use of mixed media,” she said. “In a typical figure drawing class we would only use charcoal or pencil as our medium. For a mixed media figure drawing class, we were able to bring in any materials or objects we wanted to experiment with.
Noskewicz continued, “Every class consisted of warm up gesture drawings with a live model, which then moved into a ‘long pose’ where the model would hold one pose for the majority of the class. It was a great experience being able to have that extended time with a live model for two straight weeks.”
Lee treats summer classes as if they are “artist residency programs.” He said that most students had an easier time focusing in his class because they were only enrolled in one class. Noskewicz decided to take the class because it was a requirement for her program.
However, “once I found out that Seung was teaching the class, I was ecstatic,” she said. “Seung has been a mentor to me since I started here at LIU Post in 2012. He creates such a relaxed and inviting environment in his classes and he makes everyone feel confident and ready to learn or improve their skills. It is part of an art class to have a critique, but I have never felt criticized or put down by Seung’s critiques. He has a way of critiquing and giving suggestions without making you feel defeated. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for all art professors that I have come across.”
Noskewicz believes that all students should take at least one art class while in college. “Most students that are not art majors are intimidated to go out of their comfort zone and just take a class,” she said. “It can be frightening to put your artwork on a wall and have everyone critique you if you are not confident in your ability or artistic style. You are forced to be vulnerable and show your personality and expression in a different way. It can make you see the world in a different way, and you may even learn new things about yourself through- out the class.”
Lee is teaching Introduction to Basic Drawing, Life Drawing 1, and Life Drawing 2 this semester. His recent work is presented in Rockville Centre at the Demouzy Contemporary Gallery and will be open from Sept. 10 to Oct. 17.
“ROOTS” A Solo Art Exhibit on the artwork of Seung Lee, focuses on paintings about nature. “I have spent [the] last 4 summers at the Haslla Art World at an International Artist Residency, which is located near a beautiful ocean and set of mountains in eastern Korea,” Lee said. “Staying and creating art at the Haslla Art World has made me appreciate nature in a different way and inspired me to create these latest body of paintings.”
The students’ work from Lee’s summer class are located at the SAL Gallery on the first floor of the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library. It was exhibited from Sept. 6-10, and Sept. 13-17 from 5-8 p.m.

The Hillwood Recital Hall will host two benefit concerts this fall. The first, a Musicians Without Borders event on Friday, Sept. 23, followed by Concert Across America to End Gun Violence on Saturday, Sept. 25. Musicians from the New York area, including The Circuit and David Bennett Cohen, will be playing at the Concert Across America to End Gun Violence, while musicians from all around the world will be playing in Musicians
Without Borders.
Those acts in- clude Pugwash from Dublin, Joe Rock and the Allstars from Long Island, Ann and Bones from Berlin, and Milo Saidl from the Czech Republic. WCWP and Word of Mouth Studios will present both concerts.
“The goal of Word of Mouth Studios, and founder and president Tony Traguardo, is to provide libraries, educational institutions, and cultural venues access to a diverse range of high quality performers, programs, and products for reasonable fees,” according to www. wordofmouthstudios. com.
The concert Musicians Without Borders will transpire on Friday, Sept. 23, at7 p.m., and the Concert Across America to End Gun Violence will happen on Sunday Sept. 25, at 7:30 p.m. Both concerts hope to address the
issue of gun violence as part of the dialogue in this presidential election year, according to Adam Schanke, the bass player for the Circuit, performing on Sept. 23.
Schanke spoke about how his band came to be involved in this concert. “I was seriously overwhelmed at the amount of gun violence we saw earlier this summer,” he said. “I reached out to my friend Tony Traguardo, the president and founder of Word of Mouth Studios, and told him I really wanted to do something. I had read about the Concert Across America to End Gun Violence and suggested we organize a local show. Tony and Word of Mouth Productions were able to secure the Hillwood Recital Hall.”
Schanke added, “Tony brought in the Mirage Band as well as David Bennett Cohen. I reached out to my band mates as well as my longtime friend (and fellow Freeport High whose platform is ‘to secure freedom from gun violence through research, strategic engagement and effective policy advocacy.’ We wanted to con- tribute to a group that was proactively addressing the issue of gun violence in America.”
Schanke is also aware that the concert may not have a profound impact on ending gun violence but is happy to address the issue in any way he can.
“I think there are certain artists who can become major [spokespeople] to end gun violence but those artists have a national platform and a large fan base,” Schanke said. “I am proud that my band mates and the other performers are willing to commit their energy to this show. We are doing what we can on our level to contribute to ending gun violence”
Tony Traguardo, a producer of both concerts and the founder and President of Word of Mouth Studios, is
a graduate of C.W. Post. He explained that Musicians Without Borders was booked at the Tilles Center because of his friendship with Dan Cox, the Director of WCWP, also a Post graduate. Traguargo and Cox have known each other since the early ‘80s when they attended college and worked at the radio station together.
With the help of the University and the Tilles Center, which oversees the Hillwood Recital Hall, WCWP and Word of Mouth Studios have produced other shows together.
“Surprisingly, a date was available at the Recital Hall that worked for everyone,” Traguardo said. “You could say that the stars were in alignment! Louis LaRocca has taken the ball and run with this, and his crew and the folks who work with Musicians Without Borders are solely responsible for the great acts that will take the stage at that show.”
Traguardo added, “While a producer never usually wants to do two charity events back to back, the date for the Sept. 25 event was written in stone, because it is set to coincide with the national ‘Concert Across America to End Gun Violence’ concert. This show came about when my dear friend, Adam Schanke of The Circuit, reached out to me to ask if I could help him and his friend Darryl Kendrick of the Sugar and Spice Band, put a local benefit concert together on that day,”
The Concert Across America to End Gun Violence is a benefit concert put on across the United States to raise awareness to the issue of gun violence.
“It was simple to get a few more acts to round things out, including my own duo, Mirage Project, on the bill, since the cause is one that everyone participating in the show strongly supports,” Traguardo said. In fact, David Bennett Cohen has been active in the peace movement since the early 1960s, and he’s delighted to be on the bill. Once again, the Hillwood Recital Hall happened to be available, and since some of the equipment would already be in place from the event on Friday, it would reduce some of the efforts that go into putting a show like this together.”
Musicians have a unique platform to bring issues such as gun violence to prominence. “Whether your band is on the way up and trying to ‘make it,’ you play as a part-time hobby, or you are in the most famous band in the world, performing at a benefit show is a way of using your talent to give something back to your community,” Traguero said. “Since The Concert for the People of Bangladesh, put together by George Harrison in 1971, musical performances have been seen as a potential way to call attention to, and raise money for, an important cause.”
Traguero continued, “Being on stage gives someone, literally and figuratively, a platform from which they can declare, either verbally or through the simple fact that they are on the bill of the event, their support. It’s empowering. And audience members who attend a benefit show, feeling empowered themselves by the music, will often go out and get the word out about the cause and possibly get involved themselves.”
Tickets for Musicians Without Borders can be purchased as www.eventsfy.com, while tickets for the Concert Across America to End Gun Violence can be purchased at www.brown- papertickets.com. General admission for Musicians Without Borders is $35, while tickets for the Concert Across America to End Gun Violence is $10. All proceeds for the Concert Across America to End Gun Violence will go to The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

One of the most adored British preschool television shows, Peppa Pig, has hit the road for its first U.S theatrical tour, set to visit 23 cities on the East Coast. On Wednesday, Sept.14, Peppa Pig’s Big Splash held a performance at the Tilles Center.
Peppa Pig has become one of the most cherished characters by preschoolers. The unique performance gives fans the ultimate experience, from getting out of their seats, singing songs and dancing in muddy puddles. According to William Biddle, executive director of Tilles Center, “Peppa Pig was an event selected to family audiences and was attended by many children, parents, and grandparents. We are always happy to welcome the community to our vibrant campus.”
Hundreds of people gathered after work to bring their preschoolers and toddlers to watch Peppa Pig perform. As parents arrived, they had the options of either going towards the “party pass” booth, where they could get little Peppa Pigs and swirling lights, or head towards the food stations.
The event was almost sold out, with the only available seats located on the far top left and the far top right of the theater.
According to Madeline Diaz, a guest in attendance at the show and a parent of two preschoolers, Amarie and Mikayla, the Peppa Pig show was an amazing experience.
“The staff was great, they helped me find my seat and most of all directed me to the party pass check-in which my children loved, I’m super glad I was able to bring them to enjoy the show,” she said.
“The Tilles Center hosts more than 70 performances by world-renowned artists in music, theater and dance each season,” said Jennifer Carpenter Low, director of operations. The Tilles Center is Long Island’s Premier location for performing arts. It’s a place where students and fellow members from the community can gather and celebrate performances occurring right in their neighborhood.
Tickets for performances at the Tilles Center are available for full-time students start- ing at $15 with LIU ID. For a full list of upcom- ing performances, go to http://tilescenter.org/ events.

We are back. And I am not sure about you guys, but I was bloody excited to get back in a classroom and study some good ol’ academia. Well, not the homework and the long hours of studying before midterms and finals. Nor the anxiety episodes of thinking about reading a thousand pages and writing a review in two days, especially with the nostalgia of having your shirt off, hands behind your head, soaking up a tan on the dreamy beaches of Mexico (or, for me, Long Beach).
However, the excitement of being challenged, of putting the skepticism about the presidential debate into scholastic satisfaction. We might even let a well-qualified professor change our close-minded minds just once…now, even at LIU Brooklyn.
Although my summer was filled with work. By ‘work’, I mean that I coached soccer to kids, every day, in the scorching sun, and partied it up with my fellow free folk in Manhattan. Academically, I didn’t reach targets I wanted to reach. For example, I wanted to read Hegel’s essays on aesthetics; I wanted to learn the guitar, at least a few more chords than I already know; I also wanted to read Rene Descartes’s meditations. But I never seemed to have enough time, which, in hindsight, is completely bizarre to me.
On the other hand, I presume that most of you may agree with me on this one. We spend so much time mentally as well as physically concentrated on getting amazing grades during the school year that we deplete our pedagogic fire, that burning desire to learn more. (Well, maybe only for some of us) So, when the summer comes, we say “to hell with it. I’m going to forget school and those absurdly overpriced books and focus on having an absolute ball over the summer!”
This is incredibly important.We all need to de-stress, relax,or chillax away from the frightening, manic and dogmatic period of the semesters.
A wanderlustful guru, who I proudly call one of my best friends, Seb Baxter, an MBA graduate student, said, “just follow the free love freeway and see where life takes you.” I remember the moment that he said this clearly. It was a beautiful, and rare summer’s day in the chic, stylish and gorgeous city of Gothenburg, Sweden, overlooking Poseidon himself… are you there? Great. Because when he spoke those words of autonomy to me, I grabbed it with both hands!
I bet most of you are thinking that this glorious story, which I am sure you are all very excited about, ends and then school started. But, in fact, that’s not how it finishes, because it hasn’t finished yet.
Why do we all dread the start of the new semester? We shouldn’t. I have approached this semester with open arms and with a hungry mind looking to gobble up any information I can. College isn’t a burden. It’s a time of pure opening and enlightenment—if you allow it to be, of course.
I am studying metaphysics this semester, the study of everything. Are you kidding me? I am going to get answers about questions that keep me awake at night, questions like “who am I? What is it to Be?” This really does “get my juices flowing,” as my coach would put it.
So please, fellow colleagues, take every opportunity that this semester presents. Do your work to the best of your abilities. Turn up to your classes (prob- ably with a large coffee), ready to open your mind to the endless and infinite things you may learn. As Aristotle once said, “the roots of education are bitter, but the fruits are sweet.” Let’s go and have great semester, and suffer through all the hardships, to then reap the rewards of knowledge. Good luck.

The fall semester has just begun and the university is filling up with new and returning students. Campus is coming back to life and the student counsellor services are in full swing. Majors, minors and classes have to be decided. Regardless if you are a freshman or a senior, you are faced with the choice of learning something you have inclination towards, or something new. Excel in one area or explore a new.
Student athletes are faced with similar questions. A soccer player might ask him- or herself: “Should I train my weaker foot to become all-round so I can play in more positions, or improve my already decent foot so that I can score on free kicks and win us the game? Should I work on my strengths or my weaknesses?” Become a specialist or a generalist. The dilemma goes across all fields of personal development and is therefore present at many decisive moments in life. So what path should you choose?
The obvious first answer is that the best option would be to be a specialist in many things. Unfortunately, the era of polymaths are moving further and further away. The term, often personalized through da Vinci, refers to scholars during the Renaissance and Enlightenment becoming experts in multiple scientific and cultural fields. Without depreciating their performance, this was likely made possibly due to the fact the many areas were in their infancy then, and that few people received any form of education.
Today, the situation is very different. Due to the industrial revolution, where the division of labour and assembly line was introduced, people started to specialize at work. The efficiency increased as the number of different tasks decreased and industrialized societies grew, both economically and in complexity. With globalization nothing suggests the trend will change, on the contrary, the global competition makes companies split the value chain into smaller and smaller pieces, and regarding people, pushes the demand for specialization at younger age and higher education.
Marketing and corporate strategy is on the same track, stressing that differentiating your business and finding a niche is fatally important in order to receive competitive advantage. And even though the term threshold capabilities is used—meaning you just need a certain level of skill to compete in some situations being a specialist is the overall superior choice, at least when looking at the competitive situation, such as the job market.
In biology, the generalists and specialists are viewed more equally. Being a generalist species means that you can survive in many different conditions and you can respond much better to a change in the environment or crisis than the specialist species. And as the world is constantly changing environment thanks to digitalization, disruptive technologies, and crisis, maybe being the less risky generalist isn’t that bad after all.
For example, if an economic crisis struck, it would be valuable to have basic knowledge of building houses, sewing and farming, skills that was common just a few generations back.
So far, generalist and specialist have been judged only in matter of evolutionary fitness or success on a market, which is perhaps easier when a firm or an animal is the object. When it comes to humans, other factors come into play. Marx meant that the division of labour, mentioned above, made people “alienated” and depressed as they got cut off from the whole production process and only did repetitive tasks.
That kind of argument might be dismissed as out-dated considering that machines do many simple production tasks today, but it is relevant in the sense that we are all just doing a small part in large and complex machinery. Also, most people are curious and need different sources of stimulation.
So, even though trying out new things might get you a bit down the road towards becoming a generalist, it might as well make you find that area to specialize in. And the somewhat ironic twist to the whole dilemma is that these terms are relative. It might actually be the choices of environment in which you decide to study, work and live that come to determine whether you are generalist or a specialist.

“New year, new team.” That’s what Head Coach Raenee Savin had to say about her team’s 3-0 start to the season with two of the three wins coming against top three ranked teams in Division II.
Before the start of the season, the Pioneers were slotted sixth in the NE-10 Conference coming off a 10-8 season. Opening up their 2016 campaign, the Pioneers rolled over Bentley University 3-0 thanks to some stellar defense and precision from their sharpshooters. The Pioneers allowed a measly six shots all game while they converted three of their own and their goaltending stood strong. “We have depth at midfield, our defense has been solid and our goaltending has been strong,” said Savin. When all four units: attacking, defense offensive line and goaltending are in sync, the Pioneers are tough to beat.
Another team that is tough to beat is West Chester University of Pennsylvania. On their home field for the first time, the Pioneers valiantly fought the favored No. 3 ranked Golden Rams and delivered the knockout punch; defeating them 5-2. “We have a tremendous amount of confidence in each other and that extends off the field as well. It’s just a great group of girls to coach,” said Savin.
In this matchup, the Pioneers were led by sophomore forward/midfielder Emily Miller who notched a hat trick. After Miller put the Pioneers up two goals early, their lead was cut in half. Later in the game, all three units seemed to be on the same page again as sophomore midfielder/defender Bailey Martin made a humongous save to keep the led in LIU’s favor. Goals in the second half by Miller and sophomore forward/midfielder Tarryn Morris locked up the Pioneer victory.
The Pioneer offense was stellar; accumulating 14 shots, five of which found the back of the cage. On the other side, the Golden Rams were suffocated by the Pioneer defense which allowed just six shots. For her performance during that match-up, Miller earned NE-10 Player of the Week honors.
Now, beating the No. 3 ranked team in the country is special, but beating the No. 3 and No. 1 ranked teams in back-to-back games is nothing short of incredible. That’s exactly what the Pioneers did. The Green and Gold paid a visit to East Stoudsburg University, a team they have had success with in recent memory, and played a great all-around game.
“We’ve been successful against East Stroudsburg over the recent years. We were their toughest game last year,” said Savin. In 2014, they beat the Warriors 4-1, but last season they lost a tight contest by a score of 3-2. So they play the Warriors tough and this game would be no different.
The lone goal of the contest came just after halftime from senior forward/midfielder Melissa Quintanilla. The Pioneers didn’t have many scoring opportunities in the match as they were outshot 16-3. They bent but they did not break. Senior goalie Ericka Parks played a pivotal role, saving four shots in earning her second shutout in three games.
Wins over the No. 3 and No. 1 ranked teams look good on a resume, but Savin has something bigger in store for her squad. “Our goal is to win the NCAA Tournament. Our seniors tasted success playing in the NCAA finals in 2013 and 2014. Now they wan to win it all. We are all motivated to make this happen.”
In addition to the Pioneers successful week, they also climbed the ranks of Division II teams as well. They now sit at No.7as voted on by the National Field Hockey Coaches Association.
The Pioneers offense is playing at an incredible clip to start the season; scoring nine goals in three games for an average of three goals per contest which is good enough for third in all of Division II. Their defense has also pitched two shutouts in three contests and allowed just two goals.
If things keep going like this, Savin and Co. will keep climbing the ranks and not just be a threat to make the NCAA Tournament, but make some noise in the tournament.

For 60 years, the staff of The Pioneer has worked hard to keep the C.W. Post, now LIU Post, community informed. Athletics and sports have been a big part of the history of our campus and The Pioneer has covered them since its first issue on Sept. 21, 1956. In those 60 years, the number of athletic teams in the department has increased significantly.
The Pioneer has not wavered from its goal of covering student athletes and their teams fully, fairly and accurately. These photos of sports coverage are from issues of The Pioneers through the decades, spanning from 1956-1996.

In opening up East Coast Conference play, the Pioneers dropped a 2-0 decision to the University of Bridgeport in Brookville, N.Y. on Wednesday, Sept. 14. The loss drops the Pioneers to 2-2-1 on the season while the Purple Knights prevailed and now sit at 3-1.
The match featured just seven total shots on goal and unfortunately for the Pioneers, the Purple Knights converted on half their attempts. In the 11th and 21st minutes, the Purple Knights got the ball passed sophomore goalkeeper Hillevi Eklow and into the net for their two goals.
Because of inclement weather, the match was called in the 74th minute. Head Coach Mark Dawson and his squad returned to the pitch on Saturday, Sept. 17, when they hosted Queens College in another ECC tilt from Pioneer Country.
Even though there was only one featured goal, the Pioneers came out on top thanks to sophomore forward Andrea Huntzinger, who connected for the score in the 79th minute. The go-ahead and game-winning goal came off a rebound and Huntzinger didn’t miss the opportunity.
The Pioneers dominated the action for the match as well; out- shooting the Knights at a 3:1 clip. In net, Eklow faced four shots and stopped all four of them to earn her second shutout of the season. The Pioneers are back in action on Wednesday, Sept. 21, when they play Wilmington University from the Pioneer Soccer Park in Brookville, N.Y. The non-conference matchup is scheduled to start at 4 p.m.
