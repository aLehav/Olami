In honor of Dr. Gerald Lachter, chairperson of the psychology department and a professor of psychology for more than 40 years at LIU Post, who passed away suddenly on Oct. 12, the ELIJA Foundation has started a scholarship fund in Lachter’s name.
The ELIJA Foundation is a nonprofit organization that helps families with autism and other behavioral disabilities. Lachter was involved with the organization.  “Gerry was excited for the advancement and promotion of behavior analysis on Long Island and was always the first to sign up to all the events we held,” according to ELIJA’s website. “Gerry never missed an ELIJA event. He was a dear friend and a wonderful colleague. He will be terribly missed.”
The Gerald Lachter Scholarship Fund will award one grant every year at the Long Island Behavior Analysis Conference in early December to an LIU Post or Queens College masters level or doctoral level student enrolled in a behavior analysis program, to help further his or her education in behavior analysis. The inaugural winner will be announced in December 2017 at the Annual Long Island Behavioral Analysis Conference. Individuals can fill out applications to apply for the fund starting on October 1, 2017.
Donations to the fund are tax-deductible. More information about ELIJA can be found at www.elija.org, info@elija.org or 516-216-5270.
