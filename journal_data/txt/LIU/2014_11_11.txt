Trailing 31-21 in the fourth quarter, the football team (7-3) scored 14 unanswered points on Saturday, Nov. 8, to storm back and defeat Bentley University (4-6) on Senior Day, 35-31, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
On their opening drive of the final quarter, LIU Post started at their own five-yard line. Bentley had complete control after scoring 24 unanswered points. However, red-shirt senior signal-caller Steven Laurino scrambled for five yards on the opening play from scrimmage, followed with 13- and 22-yard completions to red-shirt sophomore wideout Shane Hubbard and red-shirt senior wideout Kamron Palmer. The series resulted in a 16-yard touchdown pass up the seam from Laurino to junior tight end Sean Binckes, making it a 31-28 game.


Two possessions later, Laurino anchored another offensive assault. After starting at their own 47-yard line, Laurino completed four consecutive passes to set up shop at the Falcon seven-yard line. A few snaps later, the Boise native took a three-yard keeper into the end zone at the 2:41 mark to regain the lead for the hosts, 35-31.
With 2:34 remaining on the clock, Bentley looked to spoil the Pioneers’ rally. Graduate quarterback Danny Guadagnoli methodically drove his squad down to the LIU 25- yard line. Following back-to- back misfires through the air, Guadagnoli hooked up with Jet Kollie on a seven-yard strike to make it fourth-and-three. With only 16 seconds left and the game on the line, the Pioneers defense got one final stop as sophomore defensive lineman Kenny Scotland channeled his inner J.J. Watt and swatted away the fourth-down pass to secure the victory.
The Green and Gold got out to a hot start, as they scored on their opening series of the game. Laurino scrambled for a two-yard score at the 8:11 mark. In the early stages of the second quarter, the Pioneers capitalized off a Falcon turnover as Laurino hooked up with sophomore tailback David White on an 8-yard touchdown pass.
Heading into halftime, LIU Post held a 21-14 advantage. However, the third quarter belonged to the visitors as they gained their first lead after putting up 24 unanswered points.
That set the stage for another Pioneer comeback and Laurino’s late-game heroics. Laurino finished 34-of-48 for 363 yards and three touchdown passes. The fifth-year senior also ran for 74 yards and two touchdowns. Hubbard and Palmer each caught eight passes and accumulated over 90 yards receiving. Red-shirt senior wideout Chris McGrane had a stellar outing, catching seven balls for 92 yards. Binckes recorded five receptions for 45 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
The Pioneers defense saw red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti lead the defense with 13 tackles, while red-shirt senior defensive lineman Dan Belfiore had nine tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble. Red-shirt sophomore defensive back Justin Ortiz chipped in with six stops and two pass break-ups.
The Pioneers earned the right to play for the NE-10 championship on Saturday, Nov. 15. LIU will make the trip up to Springfield, Massachusetts for a re-match with American International. In their regular season, the Green and Gold were defeated by the Yellow Jackets 27-24. The Pioneers will be searching for their first NE-10 title since 2006. Kickoff is set for 1p.m.

Is the LIU Post campus handicap-accessible? To a large extent, the answer is yes. Certain buildings, including Humanities Hall and Pell Hall, have staircases for students to use; but they also have ramps at the entrances. For other building entrances that do not have ramps, including Hillwood Commons, the doors are handicap-accessible.
Within Hillwood Commons there are elevators for students to get from one floor to another. Other buildings with elevators are Lorber Hall, Brookville Hall, Riggs Hall, the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, Kahn Discovery Center, Humanities, the library, Kumble Hall, Pell, and the Winnick Student Center.
For most of the academic buildings, the needs of a handicapped student are met. In lecture halls located in Humanities, for example, in the far back of the room, there are slightly lower, bigger desks without chairs that can accommodate students in wheelchairs.
Inside many of the bathrooms on campus there are bigger stalls that can fit a wheelchair. Although not all of the bathrooms on campus are handicap accessible, William Kirker, Director of Facilities, stated, “There are accessible bathrooms throughout campus for convenient use. We are always looking at making bathrooms accessible as they are renovated.” For buildings that that are located near parking lots, there are designated parking spaces available to handicapped individuals.
LIU Post has recently made other improvements to make campus buildings handicap-accessible. The on-campus radio station, WCWP, built a ramp a few years ago. “We knew of a new student coming in who was going to be spending a bit of time there. The building was accessible, but not as convenient as it could be, so we took the opportunity to improve the access,” Kirker said.
“Post is very accessible and the Facilities [Department] does a great job with making sure all buildings are handicap accessible. If there is somewhere on campus that is not, you just have to let them know, and they will do their best to make it accessible,” said Charlie Moerler, a junior Broadcasting major.
Moerler added that it’s in the hands of students to speak up when a part of campus needs to be made handicap-accessible. “In regards to improvement, it’s really up to students in wheelchairs to let Facilities know what they think should be improved.” Moerler continued, “For example, when I was a freshman, I would go down to the fishbowl a lot and there was no handicap button on the door, so I asked Facilities if they could put in a button, and they did that in a relatively short amount of time.”
For students who are injured and temporarily bound to a wheel-chair, there is a different protocol. The LIU Post website states, “Students with medically verifiable disabilities, the nature of which does not qualify for handicapped parking privileges, may apply for a Temporary Parking Permit at the Medical Services located in Pell Hall. This permit is valid in Faculty/Staff parking areas and non-handicapped spots only.” Students who are not handicapped, however, must remain respectful and courteous to those who are not using these parking spaces.
Although it may be tempting if one is late for class and unable to find a regular parking spot, it will come with consequences. According to the LIU Post website, “Please remember that reserved parking is for people with disabilities and is a legal requirement, not just a courtesy. Do not allow others to misuse your plates or parking permits.”
The school enforces this policy by towing cars that are illegally parked in handicapped spaces. The website warns students of this consequence: “Any illegally parked car in a disabled parking space will be ticketed and towed at the owner’s expense. Cars will be towed by Charles Schmidt & Sons, located at 1061 Northern Blvd., Roslyn, 516-627-7630. Towing fees are at a minimum of $120.00, but are solely determined by Charles Schmidt & Sons, and subject to change at any time. Violators will also be responsible for a ticketing fine issued by the Department of Public Safety and/or local police.”
If you have suggestions to make the campus more handicap-accessible, email liupostpioneer@gmail.com, and we will publish your letter in The Pioneer’s “Letter to the Editor” section.

Browse, the latest student- run business to open in Hillwood Commons, is a technology store that sells Apple products, Dell products, gaming consoles, a variety of speakers, and a wide range of accessories. The store, which opened for business on Nov. 10, also sells GoPros, headphones, Beats Audio headphones, Apple laptops, desktops, televisions, and Apple accessories; it also has PS4, Xbox One, external hardware, Dell laptops, Alienware products, Apple iPads, and other tablets.


Browse has a customer reservation list. When a customer comes in and isn’t able to find what they’re looking for, or if a product is currently unavailable, customers can fill out a reservation sheet. This list allows the customer to get the product they requested as soon as it comes to the store. This list also allows the customer to customize the product they pre-ordered.
“It is pretty enjoyable. My co-workers make the experience more active. I’m learning a lot of information about technology [that] I never knew [before],” Manno said.
Nikhila Nemmarugommula, a Biomedical Science graduate student works at the store as well. “It’s completely different for me since I’m a science major, but at the same time, it is very exciting as I get to learn about all the variety of technologies,” she said. “We manually build the inventory, so it helps us run our own business. It is a different exposure for me, but a wonderful experience working with a wonderful team and manager.”
Although it has been open for business since Oct. 10, Browse’s grand opening will be celebrated on Nov. 17, during common hour. There will be a photo booth where students can take pictures, and a show-off table with some of the products offered in the store.

The following letter regards “Ten Facts about Post, Part VI,” which was published in the Oct. 15 issue of The Pioneer:
Dear Ms. Martelotti,
I’m sure no one told you, so it’s not anything to be embarrassed about, but we DO have adult education at Post. In fact, we have over 8,000 registrants per year back here at Lorber Hall for classes in the Liberal Arts and Sciences! I’m enclosing a brochure (which comes out quarterly with all new curriculum) so that you can see what we offer. Please feel free to come visit us anytime – my phone is 516-299-2584 if you need me.
Sincerely,
Dr. Kay Sato
Assistant Provost, Academy for Lifelong Learning, School of Continuing Education,
& Hutton House Lectures

As a result of the Ebola epidemic permeating into the United States, LIU has assembled a comprehensive protocol in the unlikely case that a student, staff member, or faculty member becomes infected with the virus.
The 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history, affecting multiple countries in West Africa. Most recently, the virus has broke out in the United States, causing one death on Oct. 8, and two local cases in healthcare workers who were treating Ebola patients in West Africa, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The recent outbreak has LIU Post students wondering: how does one contract the virus, how can you detect Ebola once one has contracted it, what would happen in the case of someone contracting the virus on campus, and how can we prevent it?
“First of all, we would have to determine if the student has been infected with the Ebola virus, which is highly, highly unlikely,” said Gale Haynes, Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, and Legal Counsel of Long Island University (LIU), LIU Brooklyn Provost, and, as her colleagues endearingly refer to her, “the Ebolizar.”
“If you traveled to an area such as West Africa, or if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has been infected with the virus, which would consist of touching, contact with an infected person’s waste products and bodily fluids, then a student might be at risk,” said Haynes. However, while the chances of someone becoming infected on either the Post or Brooklyn campus are remote, Haynes states that it is important to have a protocol and a process to deal with such a event.
There are misconceptions regarding how the Ebola virus is transmitted from one person to another. Some say that Ebola can be transmitted through the air in which we breathe; however, that is far from the truth. According to the CDC, Ebola is spread through:
• Broken skin or mucous membranes by direct contact with:
– Blood or body fluids
– Including but not limited to: urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and/or semen of a person who is sick with Ebola
• Objects (like needles and syringes) that have been contaminated with the virus
• Infected fruit bats or primates
“It might be difficult for a student to determine if they are infected with the virus because the symptoms of the Ebola virus identically mirror the symptoms of the common flu,” Haynes said.
Symptoms include: fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained hemorrhage and bleeding. Symptoms may appear anywhere from two to 21 days after exposure to Ebola, but the average is eight to 10 days, according to the CDC.
Haynes continued, “A student should take into account differentiating factors such as: have you been to West Africa within the last 21 days? Or, have you been in contact or exchanged bodily fluids with someone who has been to West Africa in the last 21 days?”
Once a student is infected, it is important for them to understand that they should not visit their local emergency room or medical clinic. “The CDC, [both] the city [and state] of New York, and the governor have mandated that if you believe that you have come into contact with Ebola, or if you might have it, you do not present yourself at an emergency room and you do not go to a doctor’s office,” Haynes said. “You must call 911 and share with them that you may in fact have been exposed to Ebola, and they will dispatch an appropriate ambulance to take you to a prepared site. This method limits the contact in the best possible way until they can be safely transmitted to an appropriate site.” The nearest designated site to LIU Post is North Shore LIJ Glen Cove Hospital located on 101 St. Andrews Lane, Glen Cove, NY, 11542.
On Oct. 16, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced that he designated eight hospitals statewide to treat potential patients. The following eight hospitals have agreed to the designation, and are creating isolation units to accept patients: Mt. Sinai in Manhattan, New York Presbyterian in Manhattan, Bellevue in Manhattan, Montefiore in the Bronx, North Shore/LIJ Health System in Nassau County, Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, and Stony Brook University Hospital on Long Island.
“The medical healthcare professions at the hospital will ask you to provide a list of people that you can come in contact with to prevent further spreading of the virus,” said Haynes. “In the case of an infected person in one of our residence halls, then an assessment of the site and appropriate cleaning of the site would be conducted.”
Recovery from Ebola depends on good supportive care and the patient’s immune response. According to the CDC, basic interventions, when used early, can significantly improve the chances of survival such as:
• Providing intravenous fluids (IV)
• Balancing electrolytes (body salts)
• Maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure
• Treating other infections if they occur
In the case that you have traveled to West Africa, display symptoms and/or if you have been in contact with someone who has traveled from West Africa and exchanged bodily fluids over 21 days, which is the life-span of the Ebola virus, even if you are tested negative for the virus, you will be either quarantined in your home or in an appropriate facility, according to Haynes. On Oct. 24, Governor Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced the mandatory 21- day quarantine of individuals who come into contact with Ebola patients, even if they show no symptoms and test negative for the virus.
“If I was quarantined for 21 days, I would be worried if I would be able to make up the work for the semester,” Jenny Edengard, a junior English major. “I would have to probably retake my courses for the semester, which [isn’t desirable] because the quarantine is mandatory and beyond your control.”
Even though the likelihood of a student on LIU campuses contracting the Ebola virus is extremely rare, education about prevention, diagnosis, and treatment might be the difference between life and death for students, faculty, and staff. If you suspect that you, or a loved one, have contracted the Ebola virus, please dial 911, and do not leave your home.

The LIU Post Admissions Office has recently been revamped to put more focus on school programs and the campus environment, as well as to reach greater numbers of prospective students with new methods of recruitment in order to increase enrollment.
“Recruiting college students has never been more challenging. The number of graduating high school students is declining in the northeast, and there is enormous competition among colleges and universities,” said Jackie Nealon, Chief of Staff and Vice President for Enrollment, Campus Life and Communications.
With competition rising, Post not only reaches out to high school administrations in the local neighborhoods, but also extends recruitment outside of the metropolitan area. “We have added targeted staff members with extensive recruitment experience in order to efficiently bring in new students,” Nealon continued. The Admissions Office is currently looking to fill the position for Dean of Admissions, which was previously held by Angela Delcid, and has been open since Aug. 5. Nealon is currently the acting Dean of Admissions.
Post’s admissions process allows prospective students to apply in different ways, other than the traditional application process of submitting an application online or by mail. One example is the on-site decision, where LIU visits local community colleges and high schools to provide information and applications for on-site declaration. One of the upcoming on-the-spot decision events will be taking place on Dec. 4 at Nassau Community College.
Post not only offers on-the-spot admissions when visiting other schools, but also holds similar events on campus as well. On Nov. 11, prospective Pioneers came to Humanities Hall to apply on-the-spot for admission. This event, more commonly known as Walk-In Admissions or Freshman Preview Day, takes place several times throughout the semester. Preview days will also be held on Nov. 22 and Dec. 6 in the Great Hall, and on Dec. 20 in Mullarkey Hall. “We invite all prospective students—first-year, transfer, graduate, adult, and visiting students— to meet an admissions counselor and learn more about the many opportunities available at LIU. We will waive your application fee. Afterwards, take a campus tour with an admissions ambassador and see first-hand how everyone at LIU Post is dedicated to helping you maximize your full potential,” states LIU’s website.
The Admissions Office has also increased the number of Open Houses in the fall. These open houses show prospective students LIU’s different programs, clubs, majors, and the overall environment of the school. “One of our events coincided with homecoming so that incoming students could feel the excitement of campus life and school spirit as they learned about our dynamic programs,” Nealon said.
Having one of the open houses during homecoming allowed the university to display Post’s unique and vibrant campus life. In addition to the open house held during homecoming, the second fall Open House was held on Sunday, Nov. 9. Admissions has also become active on social media outlets, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Prospective, current, or graduated students can simply look up the school and get an instant connection to campus life.
Applying to college is a very stressful process, and continuing the transition after being accepted can be overwhelming as well. “We provide a hands-on, personalized approach for students from the point [when an applicant] inquires about Post, through the application process to acceptance, and of course to enrollment,” Nealon said.
“My admission process was stressful, to say the least,” said Chanel Powell, a freshman Political Science major said. “No one recruited me, and the admissions department was not very useful in helping me figure out what I was supposed to be doing, or what I was supposed to have done. My success coach is the only reason I’m here this semester. The school waited until the week before move-in day to tell me via e-mail and my LIU account that ‘I was not in good financial standing’, and I ended up having to come up with the amount out of pocket or else I wouldn’t have been able to dorm.”
New changes can lead to some difficulties along the way, but LIU Post has always been committed to ensuring that the students who enroll have the ability to be successful, according to Nealon. Focusing on recruiting more students also benefits current students at Post. “The new students we bring in become classmates for our current students, so the better job we do recruiting bright, engaged, and energetic students from the region and beyond, the better it is for all of LIU’s students,” Nealon said.

1) The online version of the campus radio station, myWCWP, was founded in 1999. It is run by students and is directed towards campus ages. The radio station, 88.1, is geared towards the core audience, aged 35 and older.
2) The campus Poetry Center, which is a part of the English department, has had some of the most famous poets in America, such as Steven Spender, William Stafford, and Jean Valentine come and read their poetry.
3) In 2003, the Hillwood Art Museum was renamed as the Steinberg Museum of Art at Hillwood, when Dr. Steinberg retired as President of LIU.
4) The museum began acquiring artwork in the early 1970s and over the last three decades, more than 650 new works have entered the collection through gifts and donations.
5) The Kahn Discovery Center was the original gym on campus before the Pratt Recreation Center was built. The Pratt Center opened on April 1, 2002. The total cost of the building was $18.5 million.
6) The Tilles Center, built in 1970, was originally called the Dome Auditorium. Due to heavy snowfall, the dome collapsed on Jan. 21, 1978; however, the collapse did not damage any of the offices within the building. The repaired building was first called the Bush-Brown Concert Theater, before being named the Tilles Center. If you walk indoors from Hillwood Commons to the lobby of Tilles, you will notice the walls are rounded. This is because of the dome construction of the original auditorium.
7) In 1934, the Doll House was built. It was made for Marjorie Merriweather’s daughter, Dina, and granddaughter, Marjorie, known to the family as “Marwee.” The girls named the Doll House “Deen Wee” after themselves.
8) The Doll House had a working fireplace and a kitchen with an oven and fridge. The second floor had a bedroom and half-bath. There are historic photos on the balcony of the mansion of the interior and exterior of the Doll House, as it was in the 1930s. The woodwork inside is made to a child’s size.
9) In the 1960s, the Doll House was used as an Alumni House. In the 1970’s, it became the Women’s Center, and in the 1990s it was where the campus EMT’s (emergency medical technicians) slept until they found space in the dorms for them.
10) In the front of Lorber Hall there is a tree called the Cucumber tree, due to its large leaves that resemble the shape of cucumbers.

Veterans Day, which was celebrated on Nov. 11, honors the service of Americans who were a part of the U.S. Armed Forces. Symbolizing the anniversary of the end of the First World War, this holiday takes place on the aforementioned date since the war ended on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, in 1918.
Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States, originally announced the first Armistice Day for Nov. 11, 1919; a day to celebrate world peace and honor those who served the country. In proclaiming the holiday, he stated,
“To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations.”
In 1954, Congress changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day to show respect to those who served the country. Veterans Day is not to be confused with Memorial Day, which is celebrated annually on the last Monday of May. While the holidays are similar, Memorial Day remembers and pays tribute to the men and women who perished while serving their country in the armed forces.
Veterans Day affects students and faculty at LIU Post far beyond a day to sleep in without classes. “Veterans Day is a special time to show appreciation for all those who have served and are serving to protect our country,” Christina Kotarski, a Junior Education major, said.
Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major, agreed. “It is important to recognize those who have lost or could have lost their lives for our country.”
Associate Dean of Students Adam Grohman said that the university has “very robust plans of programs” set to commemorate Veterans Day.
“Veterans Appreciation Week” will run from Nov. 10–14, and includes events such as Peanut Butter and Jelly Time, co-sponsored by CSA, on Monday, Nov. 10, at 12.30 p.m. at the Hillwood East-West Café.
On Wednesday, Nov. 12, from 12:30 p.m.–1:40 p.m., a Veteran Appreciation and Flag Raising Ceremony will take place at Hillwood’s The End Zone. In addition, there will be a “Women in the Military” dinner on that same day from 7 p.m.–9 p.m in the Long Island Room of the Winnick Dining Hall.
Awards will be bestowed on Thursday, Nov. 13, from 12:30 p.m.– 1:30 p.m. in the Hillwood Media Room.

The Midterm elections have just passed here in America, where the Republicans hold the majority of the seats in Congress. This is extremely controversial, seeing as President Obama is a Democrat. Is this going to affect the amount of power he has? Will it affect the initiatives the Democrats planned to introduce when he was elected for a second term? These are some of the concerns and questions the American public has; however, do international students at Post ask these questions? This is what I wanted to find out.
Politics: some consider it as one of the most important things in the world, in terms of keeping societies together. But does everyone think like this? In terms of my own beliefs (which I love to provide, by the way), I feel that no matter how I think the government should be run, or how certain issues should be handled, my opinion will never be heard or acted upon. In our generation, people don’t bother with politics because of this apathy. But as I have preached these words to those people who are involved, they have replied, “Well, if everyone thought like this, nothing would ever get done.”
That is why I do feel inclined to stay up-to-date with the political affairs going on, for example the Midterm elections here in the States. I have read up on and heard a lot about it, and I want to understand the process as well as what has happened. This is also the vibe I got when I spoke to a few international students. Although they cannot vote here in the U.S., they feel as though they should keep up-to-date with the politics that goes on here, especially when it comes to elections.
Mari Eik, a sophomore Psychology major, has great knowledge of what’s happened in the Midterm elections, as well as some knowledge on how the American political system works. We spoke about how, or if, things will change due to the recent ”gob-smacking” elections where the Republicans won the most seats in both houses of Congress. Eik mentioned that she doesn’t think much will change. This was in a discussion where there were three or four people in putting thoughts in to the conversation, all of which were international students from Europe. This shows that there is, in fact, many international students that have an interest in the American political system, as well as their own.
In the LIU Post men’s soccer team, which is dominantly filled with international students, most of the players are educated about the politics surrounding them here in the United States. After having many conversations with a few players, I have come to learn individual theories, conspiracies, and thoughts on a few different matters. They have all identified and said they feel it is important to understand political systems, as well as being tuned-in on present political events.
The message I want to make clear here is: although you may not agree with what a government stands for, it is extremely important to keep up with the events and affairs that are happening at the political level. After all, politics is what runs the world, right?

In today’s age of ever-growing technology, not having the newest Android or Apple product may cause insecurity. However, no matter what type of phone, computer, or tablet you have, when breaching or hacking occurs, everyone is affected. If you have a social media page like Facebook or Twitter, or simply like to browse the web, then there is a chance your personal information has been tracked, or even stolen.
Fast Company (FastCompany.com), an editorial ventures site whose purpose is to inspire readers to lead conversation and create the future of business, asked the question: “Which narrative is correct?” When regarding the results from three separate studies, Jeffery Cole, director of University of Southern California’s Annenberg Center for the Digital Future, concluded, “Online privacy is dead.”

An experiment conducted by Harris Interactive concluded, “The 78% of millennials expressed a wish for privacy compared to 59% of older Internet users.” Meanwhile, Pew Internet’s study concluded that “users aged 18 to 29 are more likely to have cleared their browsing histories, disabled cookies or declined to use their real name on a website.”
What do LIU Post students think about privacy on the Internet, and how safe do they view the Web as a whole? Junior Broadcasting major Mike Giordano fears that personal information online is too vulnerable. “I think it’s too easy for a person to access your personal information that you enter online, and people take advantage of the freedom they have,” he said.
Sophomore Journalism major Alec Matuszak agrees with Giordano, and thinks more can be done to protect personal information online. “It’s up to the user to protect him or her self. Companies like Google, who make the majority of their money on ads, will do anything to get information on someone,” Matuszak said.
Junior Broadcasting major Courtney Cox believes that not enough is being done to restrict hackers and prevent personal information from being stolen.
“There should be more laws for privacy because some people, especially of the younger generation, don’t think before they act,” Cox said. “Some may post inappropriate pictures on, say, Facebook and then later on regret it when they are older. I think if people want to post those things, they should be entitled to it, but have the privacy they deserve.”
So, what do Post students think should be done in order to protect personal information and identities online?
“More security would definitely help,” Cox said. “Maybe some way for the website that the user is about to post on, could check that it is appropriate enough to be put up, and viewed by an audience.”
Matuszak believes not posting personal information in the first place is the safest and most secure option. “[just] don’t post personal information. Any time you post something, you’re putting yourself at risk.”
Giordano says to use discretion when browsing the Web and stay alert. “I think the easiest way to protect personal information is not to enter any information you fear may be stolen, but ultimately, there should be stricter laws,” he said. “Anybody who steals information online should face punishments that they would face if they stole personal information in any other form,” Giordano added.
The studies and opinions of Post students all share a common theme: to keep yourself safe and your information secure. It’s important to remember that the Web is an extension of our physical world, and just like anyone can steal your purse or wallet, those same people can also steal your identity. Always remember to stay cautious, don’t post what you don’t want others to see; take control of who you are, and take the necessary steps to protect yourself.

With finals fast approaching, students are in search of the most quiet, convenient study locations. So, why not the library? For starters, I believe the library is the number one go-to place on campus during this time of year. Because of its immense volume during common hour and daytime, it’s hard for many students to get in their valued study time. If only the library were open 24 hours, students could turn on their nocturnal habits and get into the swing of studying in the quiet of the night.


Sometimes we have such busy schedules that we don’t have time to study during the day. And when you head back to your noisy dorm, or loud and active home, the last thing you find yourself wanting to do is study. Thankfully, during finals, the library will be open for almost 24 hours. “During finals, we extend our nighttime hours and are open until 1 a.m. That basically covers the Reference Commons area on the main floor [including] the computers, printing, and reference assistance,” Eduardo Rivera, head of Reference Services at the B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, said.
We all need that one place to buckle down into a rhythm of studying a semester’s worth of notes. Dorms and home are bound to be full of distractions, while the biggest distraction in the library could be the student sneezing at a table across from you or Plato’s Republic opened to a dog-eared color coded masterpiece of somewhat incoherent text.
Many of us feel that the library is the only place we are compelled to crack down on our studying. Granted, you might have your phone beside you, but in places like the book stacks, phone service and WiFi become more limited as you venture into the lower levels, offering the prime getaway for hardcore studying. In this case, it is in the student’s best interest when the library is open for extended hours.
I don’t believe it’s necessary for the library to be open 24 hours for the entire semester. As Rivera said, if the library is open for 24 hours, “I [can] foresee a problem making sure all areas of the building are safe and secure in the wee hours of the night.”
Many issues would arise on whether or not the library hours should be extended to 24 hours. These issues would include staffing, security, and which services would be offered at all hours. As of now, the library is not taking any precautions to enact a 24-hour schedule. However, I do believe that the library does not need to be open 24/7 during finals because it has adequately extended its hours. There is a certain time, after all, when students should be hitting the sack and relaxing their brain and body before the big test.
In conclusion, we all know that finals week is the most crucial week for students. The library will be offering its services to students during this stressful time crunch from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. After finals are over, the library will commence its regular schedule of closing Monday through Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday at 11 p.m., and 9 p.m. on Fridays.

It’s not a normal day at Post if you walk out of your dorm room and don’t hear music blasting through the walls. Whether you’re in your car on your way to school, walking to class, or just lounging in your dorm, music serves as a means of stimulation. Music is what gets most students through a long and tiring day. With many different music apps to choose from, students are guaranteed to be satisfied with whatever it is they listen to on a daily basis.
“iTunes is the best music app,” Marise Singh, a graduate Special Education student, said. “Literally everything you need is on there; there is every single genre.” The iTunes app is not just limited for music, but also offers a lot of variety to choose from, such as games, books, movies, and more. “You’ll never need to go looking or searching. It’s on iTunes!” Singh added.
Normally you do have to purchase items on iTunes, but downloading the app is free. Prices vary depending on the item you purchase. iTunes captures its audience with animation and extravagant layouts to keep their users intrigued.
Pandora is another music app that is commonly used. Kenny Stanton, a senior Social Work major, said, “Pandora does the job; the music is easily shuffled. It also asks your opinion about your music interests.” Pandora offers widely diverse types of music, as well.
Using Pandora, you can listen to any particular genre or musical artist. Pandora also offers musicians and songs similar to your specified preference. Most importantly, it’s free for download and free to listen to at any time.
Max Bovin, a sophomore Film major, said, “Shazam is by far the best music app. It’s the most reliable.” He continued, “I’m able to find out a particular song by holding my phone to the sound of the music and Shazam supplies the song’s name and artist.” Shazam offers more than just identifying music to its users; they also offer television and movies. There is an option for free download of the app as well as an option to purchase the paid version. Shazam is another addition to an already popular technological wave of music.
In my opinion, the best music app would have to be Pandora; it is very reliable. One other feature Pandora supplies that other music apps don’t is the lyrics to the songs they are playing. It also includes the musical instruments apparent in the music. That’s pretty cool!

This past weekend, Post Theatre Company brought their production of Jonathan Larson’s Tony Award winning musical, “RENT,” to our campus’ Little Theatre. Based loosely on Puccini’s “La Boheme,” this Pulitzer Prize winning rock musical is centered on a group of destitute bohemian artists struggling to survive in New York City’s East Village under the shadow of AIDS. These artists strive and strain to create better lives for themselves and to create better art, while enduring poverty, disease, loss, heartbreak, and the fear of loneliness. Themes of heavy subjects like drugs, sexuality, and death, and the score’s gut-wrenching power ballads and heavy rock numbers made Larson’s brainchild an American musical theatre classic. The show opened on Broadway in 1996 and became a hit. Closing in 2008, “RENT” became the tenth longest-running Broadway show at the time.
Jamie Boswell, a senior Musical Theatre major, portrays Roger, an AIDS-stricken former rock star, who is also fighting a heroin addiction. “I like that Roger, despite everything he’s gone through, is really a strong spirit even though he may not feel like it,” said Boswell. “He fights every day and never stops fighting even though he thinks he wants to. I like that he fights to be true to himself and fights for his art. But with that fight, he comes across as selfish in a lot of ways; that’s probably the thing I don’t like about him. I think Roger is a bit unaware of the big picture at the beginning of the show, but it’s completely justified because of what he’s gone through.”
Boswell discussed the challenges in playing this character. “There’s been many challenges: trying to embody Roger, who is so different from myself, is one. Learning to play a bit of guitar was another challenge,” he explained. “Singing in the pop-rock genre has been tough doing so often, especially with the little amount of sleep I’ve been able to get; it takes a lot of energy.”
“This has probably been one of the smoothest and surprisingly fastest processes I’ve been in here at Post,” continued Boswell, regarding the rehearsal process. “We began with a few days of music rehearsals, did a couple of days of table work, then hit the ground running with blocking the entire show. In the midst of blocking, we’ve also shown some personal character work to the cast. It’s really been amazing. I’m proud to be a part of this show and proud of everyone involved. I think this show is going to be something spectacular and bring in audiences of all walks of life.”
Sophomore Musical Theatre major Ethan Dodd plays Roger’s roommate Mark, an independent filmmaker who is working to make a movie with a purpose as well as make a name for himself. “I’ve connected to Mark for a very long time, so it’s been an interesting journey,” explained Dodd. “I love the drive that he has and the passion he has for his art. I don’t necessarily dislike anything about him, I prefer to try and keep my insight on my characters more positive.
It’s a physically demanding show, and at times I struggle to balance supporting the breath I need throughout the show and running everywhere, but the challenge is an excellent learning opportunity.”
Dodd went on to discuss the rehearsal process. “The rehearsal process has been a collaboration between the cast, our director, Ray Zilberberg, and our music director, Nick Myers,” he describes. “It’s been exciting to get to put our own insights and opinions in the show as guided by our directors.”
“RENT” has been a fan favorite amongst musical theatre enthusiasts for many years. Its dynamic characters, memorable score and messages of love, friendship, and courage have resonated with die- hard fans, lovingly called “Rent-heads” since its opening.
“‘RENT’ is a statement piece in a lot of ways,” said Dodd. “It makes statements on American capitalism and AIDS that I agree with and that have really inspired me ever since I first began listening to the cast album.”
Boswell also discussed his connection with the show. “‘RENT’ means so much more to me than I thought it would,” he explained. “You think of ‘RENT’ as the super Broadway smash hit, but when you’re a part of it, you realize there’s so much more to it. I think ‘RENT’ resonates with so many people because it strikes a chord in a plethora of different ways. It’s about love, death, moving on, fighting to survive, and the truth of AIDS and how it can affect everyone.”
Dodd added, “Our production of ‘RENT’ is different in that some of the music has been slightly altered, and we’re focusing heavily on the acting and [the] development of characters and their relationships. We’re hoping to bring a new life to a landmark show in musical theatre history.”
Don’t miss out on “RENT!” The final performances are Nov. 12- 16, all shows at 7:30 p.m. except a 3:00 p.m. matinee on Nov. 16 and an additional 2:00 p.m. matinee on Nov. 14. Contact the Little Theatre Mainstage at 516-299-2356 or at ptc@cwpost.liu.edu. It’s time to live “La Vie Boheme.”

Behind a dressing room door backstage at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, comedian and former Tonight Show host Mr. Jay Leno, decked in denim and a white t-shirt, prepared for his stand-up act. Leno was the headlining performer for the annual Gala on Saturday, Nov. 8. Despite the small space, Leno was cool and comfortable during his interview with The Pioneer, having had many years’ experience interviewing and performing for a live audience. Leno talked about life after The Tonight Show, his return to the stand-up stage, and the importance of comedy in a dismal world.
The Pioneer (TP): Earlier this year, you said goodbye to The Tonight Show after more than 20 years of entertaining audiences as its host. How has the transition been from late night TV back to your roots in stand-up comedy?
Jay Leno (JL): Well, it’s not really that bad; it’s not different. When you do The Tonight Show, no matter what goes on, you still have to write 14 minutes of jokes every single day, and that takes anywhere from six hours to whatever it takes to finish. So, when you don’t have to do that it just frees up more time. Now, I can travel on Thursdays and Tuesdays and Mondays, whereas before I could usually travel on the weekends. I was a stand-up comedian before I did The Tonight Show; that was the anomaly. And now I’m just back on the road again.
TP: With your history as a stand-up comedian, developing new content, seeing what works and doesn’t work, and delivering a monologue night after night, did you find it difficult coming up with fresh material on a daily basis during your years on The Tonight Show?
JL: Writing The Tonight Show monologue is different than writing an act. When you do The Tonight Show, you do different jokes in the same place every night, and when you go on the road you do the same jokes in a different place every night. But the advantage of doing The Tonight Show is hopefully you’re the first person out there with a joke about whatever the subject is. The bad news, you don’t get a chance to develop it and make “a bid” out of it; it’s just a one-liner or something. When you’re on the road, you can try it out differently [every night], so by the time the weekend comes, you’ve done it enough times so you can stretch it out and let it breathe for a little bit.
TP: With regard to that last question, how does the development process differ when creating a full stand-up routine?
JL: You try to create a couple of minutes a week, which doesn’t sound like very much, but at the end of the month, if you have 10 or 15 new minutes, that’s huge. Comics are inherently pretty lazy, and trying to find something everybody thinks is funny [is tough]. You tend to analyze the laughs, you do a joke and sometimes it gets the wrong kind of laugh. So you just have to sort of feel it out, and listen to it. I try to hit a broad audience as opposed to a specific audience, and one isn’t better than the other, it’s just how you work.
TP: Since you’re performing on a college campus tonight, I am compelled to ask about your years at Emerson College in Boston. I understand that you were responsible for starting a comedy club there as an undergrad? How did that experience impact your career?
JL: When I went to school, it was the ’70s, and it was [all] “yo, stop your war machine,” and all that kind of stuff. You had a lot of people with no money willing to be entertained by people with no talent essentially, and it was mostly folk singers and rock bands. Consequently, [I] would emcee some of those, and you try to do some funny stuff in between. There was no Internet, there was no TV in the dorms, [and] so you would go to a student show.
TP: In honor of your passion for classic cars and motorbikes, 20th Century Cycles and Joe’s Garage, two local body shops on Long Island, donated the motorcycles on display in the atrium for tonight’s Gala. Where does your love for automobiles come from?
JL: I like things that roll, and explode, and make noise. When you work with mechanical things, there’s a definite beginning and end; when you tell jokes, some people like it and some people don’t. But when you take something that’s broken and you fix it, nobody can say it’s not running. So, there’s this sense of satisfaction of fixing something, and plus when you work with your hands you tend to appreciate how easy it is to be successful in show business. Show business is kind of like champagne; if you drink it every day, you just become an alcoholic.
TP: I saw that you donated $100,000 to a scholarship fund at Salem State in honor of your mentor, Lennie Sogoloff? Can you describe Sogoloff’s influence on your life in relation to your success in the business, and also how philanthropy is important to you?
JL: Lennie was a nightclub owner; he had a nightclub called Lennie’s on the Turnpike, which is just the funniest-sounding name. But he was a very nice guy, and I went in one day and said, “I’m trying to be a comedian,” and I had to stand in front of his desk and tell some jokes. He kind of made me the house emcee and the house comic, and it was a great place to learn and perform and do things. So he was a great influence for me; he teamed me up with Miles Davis and Mose Allison and all the jazz greats of the ’50s and early ’60s, so that was pretty good. Philanthropy is important obviously; you can only eat so much pie, and I have as much pie as I need, so it doesn’t hurt to spread it around.
TP: Last night, you returned to late night as a guest on The Tonight Show with new host, and your successor, Jimmy Fallon. How did it feel to revisit your old stomping ground?
JL: Oh, it was fun! I like Jimmy; he’s a great guy. We had a good time.
 TP: Do you think he’s doing a good job?
JL: Yeah, he’s doing a real good job. He brought something new to it [with the] viral videos. In my age, I can’t really pretend to know all of Jay-Z’s music, okay? Because [then] you’re the creepy old guy. You have to play your age.
TP: How has comedy changed your life?
JL: I was dyslexic; I was not a very good student. So I thought I would do [comedy] until I had to get a real job. I had a teacher when I was in high school, Mrs. Hawks, and she stopped me one day in the hall and said, “You’re always screwing around in class, disrupting, and making noise.” She said, “Why don’t you write some of these stories down, and you could read them to the class, and I could give you credit for creative writing.” It was the first time in my life I actually enjoyed doing homework, and I would spend a couple of hours trying to get it right. When I read it to the class, it wouldn’t get laughs, and I would learn “oh, okay that sentence went on too long.” I ha[d] no need for algebra, but this was something I thought was pretty cool. I never thought anything I learned in school would be beneficial to something I would do in real life, and then all of a sudden here was something that I liked doing and that people seemed to like.
After his interview with The Pioneer, Leno performed his 90-minute comedy act. He greeted the sold-out show at the Tilles Center in a suit and tie, microphone in hand. His jokes were met with uproarious laughter and occasional applause. His set resonated the classical humor he demonstrated on The Tonight Show, and proved his so-called title as “the hardest working man in show business,” although he denied this to The Pioneer.
Leno was awarded the 17th Annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by The Kennedy Center on Oct. 19, and will return to the small screen in 2015 with Jay Leno’s Garage, a new TV show based on his popular web series of the same name.

On Saturday, Nov. 8, the men’s basketball team played an exhibition match against the Manhattan College Jaspers. Last season, the Jaspers played in the Division I March Madness Tournament and suffered a loss at the hands of the Louisville Cardinals. The Jaspers willed their way to a hard-fought 78-67 win in Riverdale, N.Y.
The Pioneers battled valiantly through most of the first half, but saw a surge by the Jaspers over a four and half minute span. The Jaspers ripped off a 13-1 run, pushing their lead from two to 14. The Pioneers did not give up, though, as they were able to slowly trim the lead and get it down into single digits in the winding minutes of the first half. With Manhattan up 33-31 and just under four minutes left in the half, the Jaspers regrouped and closed the half strong with a 9-1 run.
As the second half got underway, junior forward Ashton Pankey went to work and hit a pair of layups. Pankey scored eight of the first 13 Jasper points in the second half and capped it off with a thunderous dunk. The dunk sparked a 10-0 run for the Jaspers as they extended their lead to 63-45 with just over 11 minutes remaining.
However the Pioneers showed perseverance, battling back and cutting the deficit to single digits multiple times, but in the end, the Jaspers were too much to handle. Senior Manhattan forward Emmy Andujar and Pankey each finished one rebound shy of a double-double. Senior Pioneer forward Tyuan Williams led all scorers on the afternoon with 20 points, while senior forward Charles McCann grabbed a game- high nine boards and added six points. It was a tale of two halves for the Pioneers as they made some strides in the second half, improving their percentages from the field and from down town.
The Pioneers will kick-start their season on Saturday, Nov. 15, when they face off against American International College at the Pratt Recreation Center in Brookville, N.Y. The tipoff tournament is scheduled for 2.30 p.m.

On Friday, Nov. 7, the LIU Post field hockey team play its first of two games over the weekend. The game against Bellarmine University ended with a jubilant 5-0 win for the Pioneers. Two goals from junior forward Keliann Margiotta alongside two from freshman forward Kaycee Zelkovsky ensured the Green and Gold would make easy work of Bellarmine and go into their next match full of confidence.
The second match featured the Pioneers and Saint Anselm College on Sunday, Nov. 9. LIU picked up its ninth conference win of the season, which elevated the Pioneers to the top spot in the Northeast-10 Conference standings. It took just nine minutes for the Pioneers offense to break through. Great work from Margiotta provided senior forward Stephanie Ruhle a chance to draw first blood. It then didn’t take long for senior forward Lyn-Marie Wilson to open her assault, the first came unassisted after 24 minutes. The second came as the Pioneers were awarded a penalty, which Wilson converted to secure a 3-1 lead going into the halftime break.
The Pioneers continued their tenacity in the second half, pounding Saint Anselm’s defense. Wilson was at the head of the spear as she converted another opportunity, giving her four goals of the day. The Saint Anselm offense only managed a measly three shots compared to 20 shots for the Pioneers.
Sitting atop the conference going into the final regular season match, sophomore defender Abi Sawyer said, “I really want to finish the season on a high, [and] winning against American International would be a great way to finish the regular season.”
The Pioneers are back in action for their regular season finale this afternoon at 4 p.m. against American International.

On Thursday, Nov. 6, the second-seeded men’s soccer team (14- 4-1) squared off against the third-seeded Dowling College Lions (10-6-2) in the East Coast Conference semifinals in Brookville, N.Y. The Pioneers, powered by four goals in the second half, blew past the Lions and won by a score of 4-1.
Although the Pioneers were trailing 1-0 at intermission, they controlled most of the action in the first half, outshooting their opponents and holding the advantage in corner kicks. Less than five minutes into the second half, junior midfielder Per Forgaard was able to beat junior goalkeeper Chris Friedl to even up the match at one.
In the 61st minute, the Pioneers took control of the game, as sophomore back Johannes Forgaard gave the Green and Gold a lead they would not relinquish. The sophomore was able to put back a rebound off the Lion goalie to give his squad the upper hand. Up 2-1 in the 69th minute, Per Forgaard notched his second goal of the match. This time, he dribbled his way around two defenders and fired a shot that found the back of the net. The goal gave the Pioneers a commanding 3-1 lead.
Later in the match, sophomore midfielder Maxime Devillaz added a goal for good measure and pushed the Pioneer advantage to 4-1. With the victory, the Pioneers punched their ticket to the East Coast Conference final.
The Pioneers returned to action on Saturday, Nov. 8, when they took on the NYIT Bears (14-2-1) in the ECC Championship match from Old Westbury, N.Y. The Nationally no. 22 ranked Pioneers suffered a 1-0 loss—the team’s first in over a month.
One tally is all it took to decide a winner, and that score came in the third minute of the match. Senior back Javier Gallardo was able to beat junior keeper Jesper Malmstrom. One of the better opportunities for LIU to score on the afternoon came in the 89th minute. With a corner kick at their disposal, the Pioneers sent a pass to the box and a header by graduate back Seb Baxter went wide of the net.
The Pioneers outshot the Bears 14-9 and held a significant advantage in corner kicks, but the Bears made the most out of their opportunities and came away with the hard-fought victory. Head Coach Andreas Lindberg and the Pioneers will travel to Southern New Hampshire on Thursday, Nov. 13, for the first round of the Nationals, starting off the weekend with yet another face-off against NYIT. Kick-off time TBA.

The women’s swimming team (3-1) welcomed their opponents from Kutztown University to Brookville, N.Y. and overwhelmed them in the water on Saturday, Nov. 8. The Pioneers had to race on stricter premises to even out the scoreboard. So far this season, the Green Machine has marked two new pool records—and they are eager for more.
The home team got off to a strong start as the Pioneers clinched first and second place finishes in both the 1000-yard freestyle and the 200-yard medley relay. The winning-streak then continued throughout most events of the day.
Junior Joyce Kwok showed why she is the reigning 200-yard butterfly National Champion, by racing to a time 2:05.21; good enough for an NCAA “B” qualifying mark in her specialty event. Junior Meghan Brazier also posted a NCAA “B” cut time, as she finished the 100-yard freestyle event at 52.26, claiming the first spot.
The final score was counted to 132-110, after the Pioneers gave out so called “pity points” to even out the score; the home team could count less of its racers’ times as a way of making the competition more fair.
“It feels really great in the group,” said freshman Erika Hultman, who stepped out of the pool with a top spot in the 100-yard breaststroke race at a time of 1:10:15. “We have already marked two pool records, which confirms the good start of the season.”
The two pool records came in the 200-yard medley relay team made up of senior Johanna Pettersson, Hultman, Kwok, and Brazier, and the 400-yard ditto with Pettersson, Kwok, Brazier and senior Carolin Rademacher.
“We have our Metropolitan Conference Championships in February. Going as back-to- back winners, I hope and believe we will be able to deliver as well this season,” Hultman said. “But we have only just started, and our first real test will come in two weeks in New Jersey with some great competition.”
The Rutgers University Invitational in New Jersey is a weekend-long meet that will take place on Nov. 21–23. Before then, Head Coach Maureen Travers and the Pioneers will race Fordham University on Friday, Nov. 14, in Bronx, N.Y. The teams are scheduled to hit the water at 6 p.m.
