LIU Post’s new boutique, located in the old gaming lounge in Hillwood, attracted faculty, staff, and students to its grand opening, Nov. 12.

The anticipation was high as guests waited for the special ribbon cutting, which symbolized the official debut of Post’s first student-run store. Contrary to what might be expected at a grand opening, no food or refreshments were served. However, that didn’t stop the boutique from filling quickly with intrigued students, faculty and professional photographers.
“This boutique is a great way for students to gain hands on experience, and to become entrepreneurs,” said Christina Principato, a senior Accounting major, who works at the boutique.
Nicole Balnis, a sophomore Social Work major, was excited when it came to revisiting the boutique in the near future. “I think it’s pretty nice, and I like that it has nice clothes, that I can definitely see people wearing,” Balnis expressed.
Tamir Dayya, manager and representative, spoke out about the interest, the boutique’s aim, and its progress from the earlier stages. “We had the boutique up and running, from the ground up in two weeks. Everyone from the facilities, to President Cline helped us out. It was true, genuine, teamwork,” said Dayya.
“The whole point is to get the students to run it, so they can learn about executive choices, and envelop themselves in management that can be fun, but also hard work,” Dayya said when asked about the boutique’s purpose on campus. “Thus far, we’ve gotten nothing but positive feedback, and we are very proud of the work we’ve done up to this point,” he added.
“I think it’s a good idea but I don’t know how many students it’s really going to bring in as customers,” said Stephanie Morales, a sophomore Art Therapy major. Morales had a notion that the boutique would definitely draw in various eyes from every direction, but she was unsure if the interest would stay alive.
“Everyone that I’ve spoken to about it, hasn’t shown any real excitement, or interest about it,” she added.

After years of complaints from on-campus residents and commuters, the Student Government Association (SGA) of LIU Post decided it was time to update the school’s shuttle bus service. Now the shuttles between Post and Hicksville, and between Post and Wheatley Plaza, have new routes and hours.

As The Pioneer reported in the Opinions section in its Oct. 9, 2013 issue, Post students have repeatedly requested shuttle bus changes to accommodate their schedules. Between 1,000 and 1,200 Post students use one of the university’s shuttle buses every week and commuters highly depend on the service, mainly to transport themselves between school and Hicksville train station, according to Dan Potenzieri, SGA president.
However, previous routes and schedules caused many students to miss train connections and to be left behind, due to a limited number of seats and too many students during the peak early morning and afternoon hours.
“Many comments and concerns about the shuttle bus route and schedule reached SGA in the past year, so we felt the need to make a detailed review of the shuttle buses’ stops and usage,” said Potenzieri.
“The new schedules for the off-campus shuttles look very different compared to the old ones,” Potenzieri said. “Regarding the bus that runs between Post and Hicksville train station, we changed the hours and were able to fit in two more runs on weekdays by eliminating the stop outside Waldbaums in Hicksville. This allows the shuttle to better service students during peak times,” Potenzieri added.
“Regarding the shuttle between Post and the Pathmark at Wheatley Plaza in Greenvale, the amount of runs have been shortened but we have included more stops. The shuttle now drives across the street from Pathmark to Moe’s and Wendy’s to provide service to more locations for students.”
Petter Holmsen, senior Film major, used to drive to school, but moved in the beginning of the semester and now commutes from Hicksville to Post by shuttle bus. He understands why the Waldbaums stop was removed. “In my opinion, stopping outside Waldbaums was like a joke. No one ever got off or on there,” he said.
Julia Rosen, senior Psychology major, agrees. “It was an unnecessary stop because there is not much reason to get off there. If students want to go food shopping, they would probably use the Pathmark bus instead,” she said.
Students also appreciate that the new changes include more runs and extended hours. “With the updated schedule, one can take the bus and arrive just in time for the 9:30 a.m. class. Earlier, we got to campus more than half-an-hour before our classes started because that was the only option,” Rosen continued.
“It is also great that they have extended the hours so that one can stay on campus until late. Earlier, the last shuttle left campus at 8 p.m. while many students got out of class at 8:25 p.m.,” she added.
Abby Van Vlerah, Post’s new dean of students, was involved in the process of changing the schedules, and explains that it was necessary to increase the runs during both mornings and late evenings. “Student Life worked closely with the SGA to meet the needs of the larger student body: commuters, residents and grad students,” said Van Vlerah.
“For example, we increased night time shuttle to Hicksville train station to accommodate those who end class at 9 p.m.,” she added.
For years, off-campus students who have ended evening classes later than 8 p.m. have been forced to find alternative ways of transporting themselves home. It has been difficult to prioritize the shuttles due to competing issues that also required funds and attention, according to Potenzieri.
“Currently, the cost of the school’s public transportation options comes from the Student Activities Fund. This is also where club budgets, the Spring Fling concert, Welcoming Week, Homecoming and other student life events are funded through,” Potenzieri said.
Holmsen understands that the prioritization is complex and is glad that the changes finally happened. “It was about time,” he said.
However, “Even though I like the update, I wonder why on earth this occurred in the middle of the semester? No one told me about a new schedule, so I found out the hard way; with wet hair, dressed in a thin cotton jacket on a particularly cold November morning. I got to the bus stop, unaware of the changes, and had to wait out in the cold for more than 30 minutes, which was not fun at all,” Holmsen added.
Potenzieri explained that the SGA is trying their best to inform students. “The new schedule has been posted on Post’s website under Student Services and new paper schedules were handed out to the bus drivers so that they could give them to students,” he said.
Potenzieri encourages students to reach out to SGA with comments about the updates. “You are more than welcome to communicate how you feel about campus’ transportation options during SGA’s general meetings at 6:30 p.m. every Tuesday at the Top of Commons in Hillwood. An even more efficient way to reach us is by e-mail at liupost.sga@gmail.com,” Potenzieri said.
Vlerah also welcomes student opinions. “If students have questions, comments, or concerns about campus life, they can visit my office directly [at 201 Winnick House] or the offices within the Dean of Students area including Offices of Associate Deans Jessica Hayes and Adam Grohman, Student Life and Leadership Development, Residence Life, and International Student Services,” she said.

While many college students would prefer to remain Internet explorers, they are missing out on the un-digital beauty that nature walks and state parks hold. Tucked away near the LIU Post campus are lovely little locales just begging to be explored. This article will enlighten you on some unexplored scenic routes of the island and where to find them.
Situated on the North Shore of Nassau County is the Caumsett State Historic Park Preserve. This park is located in Huntington on a picturesque peninsula that extends into the Long Island Sound. It offers miles of pathways for walking, jogging, hiking, and biking. Also featured are designated nature trails over acres of woodland, meadows, rocky shorelines, and Caumsett’s salt marsh.
The park offers a wide variety of activities to choose from due to Caumsett’s great geographical diversity. Students can pursue multiple activities such as fishing, bird watching, nature photography and study, and horseback riding on the park’s bridle paths. Since Caumsett State Park is part of New York Audubon’s Huntington and Northport Bays’ Important Bird Area, the site has Bird Conservation Areas (BCAs) located throughout the preserve.
There are four specific BCAs within Caumsett: a migratory concentration site, a diverse species concentration site, an individual species concentration site, and a species at risk site. Interested in exploring? The Caumsett State Historic Park and Preserve is located at 25 Lloyd Harbor Road in Huntington; for more information, visit the official site at http://www.nysparks.com/parks/23/.
Located at 196 Bayville Road in Locust Valley is the Bailey Arboretum. The spot offers 40 beautiful acres of woods, ponds and gardens. A stroll down Bailey’s well-marked woodland trails offers signs that inform visitors about Long Island’s ecological history. The arboretum hosts public programs with a free admission fee. Some special events include guided walks for the whole family, workshops, plant sales, and live music.
Nature-loving guests can also rent space at Bailey Arboretum for private events such as weddings, benefit dinners, and other celebrations. The affairs are held in Bailey’s historic house situated on the grounds of the arboretum. For more information on upcoming events and getting involved, visit http://baileyarboretum.org.
On Long Island’s South Shore is Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve, located along the Meadowbrook Parkway in Merrick. Dedicated in memory of the late New York State Senator, Norman J. Levy, the park serves as a plant and wildlife sanctuary as well as a tranquil getaway for adventurous residents.
In its commitment to environmental conservation, the Town of Hempstead converted the former Merrick Landfill into Levy Park and Preserve.
The most visible feature of the park is the fully operational agricultural windmill, which is used to circulate the water in two man-made ponds on top of Merrick Mountain that provide a fresh-water habitat
for wildlife. From the top of the summit on a clear day, visitors can see spectacular sights of the Jones Beach Water Tower, the Manhattan Skyline and other coastal treasures. The preserve also includes a kayak launch into the original Meadow Brook, as well as three miles of hiking and jogging trails with 18 exercise stations along the way.
The 52-acre facility also features a 500-foot fishing pier into Merrick Bay, as well as woodland and prairie plant communities to attract different types of birds. Other thriving wildlife includes turtles, snakes, and foxes. Tours of this innovative preserve and recreational facility are available for visitors to learn about the beautiful parkland. Tours can be arranged by contacting the park’s office at 516-804-2000.
For additional information, log on to http://toh.li/preserves-and-nature- areas/norman-j-levy-park.
Post students agree that getting outside your comfort zone
and exploring the unknown warrants adventure and appreciation for the great outdoors. “I like being outside and looking [at] and exploring nature, and I think it’s a good activity to do with the whole family,” said Lauren Lipari, a freshman Radiological Technology major.
“I think parks are majestic and beautiful; they are fun to explore and it’s good to get out every once and
a while. I love exploring,” said Josh Sutphen, freshman Nutrition major.
Caumsett, Bailey, and the Levy Preserve are just three of the countless scenic sites in our area. Other remarkable spots include the Planting Fields Arboretum of Oyster Bay, as well as Captree and Robert Moses State Parks along Ocean Parkway on the South Shore. What are you waiting for? Adventure is out there.

In appreciation for our troops, Veterans Day is a day of celebration and gratitude. At the LIU Post campus, it will be no different. Post is hosting a number of events all week that are being organized by Veteran Students United (VSU).
“The VSU will be honoring our veterans with a flag raising ceremony on Tuesday, Nov. 12, during common hour,” said Dan Potenzieri, the Student Government Association (SGA) president and vice president of Veteran Students United.
“In addition we will be having a Women in the Military banquet on Wednesday, Nov. 13, in the Top of Commons from 7 to 8:30 p.m.,” he added.
Veterans Day Events:
What exactly do we celebrate on Veterans Day? We celebrate the Veterans, yes, but how and for what? “I think Veterans Day is important because it reminds our nation about the sacrifices our men and women
have made to maintain the principles of freedom and democracy,” said Potenzieri, who is also a first-generation U.S. Marine. “Many of our men and women in the armed forces serve several tours of duty overseas, away from their friends and family,” he added. However, this year is especially significant to Potenzieri. “It means more to me now than previous years because I’m a veteran myself. It gives me great pride to know I served my country and fought alongside so many others who are no longer with us today,” he said.
“It serves as a day to remember those past, present and future who decided to do something much larger than themselves and many have paid the ultimate sacrifice for that,” he added.
While Nov. 11 is a day for some students to celebrate by sleeping in, some recognize that this holiday is a day of thanks. “I plan on attending the flag raising ceremony on Nov. 12 during common hour and calling my father, who is a veteran, and thanking him,” said Nick Butera, a sophomore Health Science major. “I also plan on watching ‘Saving Private Ryan’; who doesn’t do that on Veterans Day?”
Zach Servino, a junior Broadcast Major, said, “I’ll probably attend the flag ceremony. [I’ll] express my thanks that way and watch ‘Band of Brothers.’”
Veterans Day continues to be observed on Nov. 11, regardless of what day of the week it falls on. It is a celebration to honor America’s veterans for their patriotism, love of country, and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good.

November is here and guys everywhere are throwing out their razors. If you are one of the many individuals out there who is choosing to participate in “No Shave November” for fun, you may be happy to hear that growing out your mustache may also help men suffering from cancer and mental health issues.
Movember is a global charity that encourages men to grow out their mustaches and spread the news about men’s health during its month-long journey. The men who register to be a part of Movember, also known as Mo Bros, are to start the month with a clean shave.
Members try to get family and friends involved by asking for donations. As the days go by, your mustache is going to start bringing in attention. Once a stranger asks about your ‘stache, that’s your cue to start explaining what the charity does and inform those individuals about men’s health awareness.
This charity is not only limited to men. Women can register, too, and become Mo Sistas. Mo Sistas are not expected to grow an awesome mustache during the month, but instead to encourage the men in their lives to try to grow out their facial hair for the cause. At the end of the month, the Mo Bros and Mo Sistas can either hold or attend events to celebrate their hair growth and hard work toward making a change.
Movember holds gala parties that are unique, just like their members. At these galas, members are given awards such as Lame Mo for those who had some difficulty growing out their mustache, and Miss Movember for the Mo Sista who had the best Movember spirit.
This charity gives its members the opportunity to not only raise awareness for a great cause, but to have an amazing time while doing so.
For more information, visit us.movember.com. Remember, the better the ‘stache, the more awareness and cash.

Hillwood Commons at LIU Post is changing. There is talk of a juice bar, candy store, Apple Store, non-alcoholic sports bar, new cinema, and even rumors about a Chipotle being built. A new clothing boutique is already open. A McDonald’s rumor was dismissed at the Student Government (SGA) meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 5. However, with all the anticipated changes, it’s important to consider some factors before making any conclusions.
As someone who lives on campus, I can say there are limited options when it comes to food and things to do without leaving Post, especially during the weekends. Most of the food options are not available during the weekends. The only place to eat some real food is at Winnick.
If you get hungry during the night, you can treat yourself to some chips, ramen noodles, or a Pop-Tart at the Little Shop of Commons, which is situated in the same building, the Arnold S. Winnick Student Center.
If you want something else, you have to leave campus or order in. So, if the school is making some changes in the food department, that would be a good thing, but the school should not forget the students who live on campus full-time. To accommodate the resident students’ needs, the school should first extend the hours and days of operation of the food court at Hillwood, and provide an alternative to Winnick. Those would be nice changes. 
Things to do on campus, other than scheduled social events, are quite limited. Winnick and Starbucks have always been a good place to relax, but having some more options – like going to a juice bar, candy store, or even a sports bar – would be some good alternatives. The cinema is always fun, but it does not run all the time. If the school were to provide a real cinema, such as the dialogue among students suggest, that would be pretty cool. Whether we need these alternatives is another story, but it would be fun to have some more options.
Well, I love Apple products as much as the next person, but after paying tuition, living on campus, and taking the occasional trip into the city, there is not that much disposable income.
An Apple Store is a good idea in theory, but I do not think that students are going to pay hundreds of dollars on Apple products unless there is something they need, and that happens maybe a couple of times a year. My question is, then, how if it is ture, will an Apple Store survive on campus?
Finally, it all comes down to needs and alternatives. I think that some changes in Hillwood Commons will be interesting, as long as they do not impact the students in a negative way. It is only positive to have options, but that depends on the hours of service. If the changes truly benefit all the students and draw more students to this school, I think that these changes can be good – but I encourage change within reason.

On Friday, October 25 Comedy Central held a conference call between Adam Devine and college publications from all over the country. In that hour Devine, of Workaholics and Pitch Perfect fame, discussed everything from parties, his colleagues, his teenage years, and his new show Adam Devine’s House Party, which airs Thursdays at 12:30 AM on Comedy Central. Always comedic, Devine wished for the readers of every paper to know that he was “having some great farts” during the call. So, keep that in mind as you read.
Adam Devine’s House Party is a half scripted, half improvised show, mixed with stand-up from his old colleague, and a recurring giant house party held at his fictionalized estate. Each week there is a new short story starring a new stand-up comedian. “This is what I wanted it to be about,” said Devine, “Just a few old buddies of mine and I getting together, partying. It really gives them a chance to broadcast themselves as well, which all of them deserve.”
Devine eagerly discussed the new show, and the differences it has from Workaholics. “House Party is a very different thing,” he said, “Workaholics is a twenty-two minute story, while House Party is just a seven minute short. House Party is my thing, and while Blake and Anders (from Workaholics) appear, it’s very brief. This is just a solo show to show my old stand-up buddies.”
While Devine said how much he loves the new format of shooting, he did discuss the future of Workaholics. “I hope to keep the show going,” he said, “Season four starts in January, and it’s been going great so far. All of us are signed on for season five.”
Devine noted the influence and involvement of Comedy Central, who allegedly have a very lax way of handling stars like him. “They are great,” Devine said, “they’re always open for new ideas, and they give us a lot of leeway with creativity. Plus, they let me smoke weed. That’s the best job ever.”
DeVine moved to Los Angeles after high school looking to have a successful career in comedy. It was in California that Devine met future coworker, Blake Anderson. In this time, they rented a house where they now film Workaholics, and held parties.
“It all started senior year of high school,” noted Devine, “I had 700 to 800 kids over and we were all drinking. The cops came and I said, ‘sorry, officers, is the music too loud?’ and I told them I would get everyone out, which lead to me going back and screaming, ‘run, the cops are here. Everybody run.’ Then, Blake and I threw a few together. He jumped off the roof and broke his back. If I had the brains of Adam DeMamp [from Workaholic] I’d be dead.”
Despite the messing around, Devine has had a successful career, going on four years strong in his serious television involvement. Although details were vague, it appears he will have a very busy 2014. This includes Workaholics, Modern Family and a possible stand-up special. “There’s already so much happening,” he said, “I really hope Comedy Central keeps House Party. It’s a lot of work, but it really is the best job ever.”
Devine delivered a short bit of advice, before a three minute goodbye session to the conference: “Please remember, spread the gospel and don’t do meth. Breaking Bad was great, but don’t do meth.”

With less than six weeks until Christmas, and a few days until Hanukkah, many shoppers are starting to run frantically around this time of the year. Within this month, there are two events that gamers and parents are anticipating: The release of major next generation consoles –Microsoft’s Xbox One and Sony’s PlayStation 4.
While the PlayStation 4 releases on Nov. 15, and the Xbox One on Nov. 22, companies like GameStop and Target are preparing for massive swarms of customers between the two days. Most stores on Long Island have run out of preorder spots for both systems. According to Amazon. com, all bundles for Xbox One and PS4 are completely out of stock.
Putting the two side by side, the Xbox One and PS4 each possess distinct features, while some similarities are also present. Each system is equipped with 8 GBs of RAM, a Bluray Player, and 500 GBs of internal memory for game saves, downloads, and applications. However, the winner of the console wars will be determined after sales are calculated.
So, what should every consumer look for when deciding which console to buy? First, take a look at the prices. The Xbox One retails at $499, which includes the system, a controller, and a Kinect sensor. PS4’s starting price is $399, and comes with the system and controller.
Unlike the Xbox One, PS4’s camera is optional. A Kinect sensor is required to operate the Xbox One, but not mandatory to use. Thomas Sherman, a junior Digital Arts and Design major, said in regard to the required sensor, “I’m getting an Xbox One because it’s been a dream of mine since I was little to tell my stuff what to do. I’ve always wanted to say, ‘Xbox, turn on.’ Now, I can do that.” Another consideration should be based on the first-party games. Xbox One exclusives include, “Ryse:
Son of Rome,” “Dead Rising 3,” and “Forza 5,” all of which are first-day release games.
Other Xbox One exclusive titles that come out in the upcoming year are “Titan Fall,” “Halo,” and “Kinect Sports: Rivals.”
The PS4 is bringing sequels to some big hits, such as “Infamous: Second Son” in April 2014 and “Killzone: Shadow Fall” which is available in stores now. Other quirky titles that are new and exclusive to the console include “Octodad,” “Knack,” and “Flower.”
“I [have] had a [PlayStation 3] since forever, and I’ve played the Infamous and Killzone series. It’s great and [the system] is cheaper. That’s why I’m excited for the PS4,” said senior Psychology major Junior Pluviose.
Be aware the contrast between PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. The PSN paid membership is not required to use applications such as Netflix or Hulu, while Xbox Live Gold is necessary. The PSN membership costs $50 for the year and offers discounted games, as well as free games for those who keep the membership.
Xbox Live Gold members pay $60 for a 12-month membership. Only recently did the XBLG offer free downloads of classic Xbox and Xbox 360 games. However, the gaming community of Xbox Live is one of the largest among gamers and offers some of the best servers for third-party games, such as “Call of Duty” and “Battlefield.”
After talking with members of the vast gaming community of Hillwood Commons, the majority ruled that the PlayStation 4 was the supposed victor of the console wars. Still, with all this information at hand, which will you choose: Xbox One or PlayStation 4?

Godspell was originally written and directed by John-Michael Tebelak in 1971, using the Gospel of Saint Matthew as a basis. Starting as a somewhat modest Masters’ thesis project at Carnegie Mellon, the musical had a rapid success; Godspell was staged at La MaMa, the Cherry Lane Theater, and the Promenade Theater on Broadway. Tebelak received the 1971 Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Director, before going on to co-write the 1973 film adaptation. More, the Christianity-heavy production went on to win several Tony Awards, with the involvement of the composer Stephen Schwartz (Pippin, Wicked), whose additional lyrics and musics prevail today.
The newest broadway revival had its tour stop at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts on Friday, November 8. Directed by David Hogan (A Starbright Christmas), the production starred Jake Stern (Hemlock Grove on TV) as Jesus, and Graham Parkhurst (Blood Brothers, Anne) as Judas. As usual, student tickets were available for $15 dollars.
As both an infrequent theater and church goer I was somewhat taken aback by the preach-heavy focus of the musical. Godspell is structured around the teachings of Jesus Christ, with a series of parables that establish Christian values through song. First seeing the stage, which had elevations for the actors and musicians, and featured a large backdrop made to look like the stained glass of a cathedral, it was apparent that I was out of place. Yet, I was wrong.
While at first Godspell seemed like a day at Sunday school with the Wiggles, the actors dressed in flamboyant colors, and uncomfortably enthusiastic, it was easy to have fun. The skill of Hogan as a director was apparent, where the interactions between the Stern, Parkhurst, and the rest of the cast were on point and fluid enough to have audience participation. First, an audience member was brought up to play a game of Pictionary that resulted in an answer to a parable. Two other times audience members were brought up, yet the fluidity of the musical was never halted.  At the fifteen minute intermission, actors came off stage and served the blood of Christ, really Kool-aid, to the audience.
Godspell is a very adaptable musical. This was apparent in the modern references and jokes imbedded in the dialogue. To make examples, or mock characters for the parables, people like Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Linsday Lohan were satirized, with musical references that ranged from “Gangnam Style” to Lady Gaga. Being over forty years old, Godspell has had a great longevity, no doubt attributed to the malleability of its lyrics.
This current revival of Godspell will continue their tour into March, ending in Texas. Seeing a production of the musical is recommended, but only for those who have the patience and interest for a religiously charged experience.

From Nov. 5 through 9 the Student Art League Gallery in Hillwood Commons welcomed an exhibition of student photographers, each displaying five examples of their work interpreting the theme Picture Perfect. The varied assembly included Lexi Ferreri, Nicole DiGiovanni, Linsday Bauer, Tara Ann Ramsay, Rebecca Grace Perdicou, Liz Santiago, and Chrissy Morgera. As a part of Photo 7 with Professor Joan Powers, the group had prepared for the exhibit the whole semester. The class had a vote on the name, settling with “Picture Perfect.”
“For weeks we have been doing critiques, spending time and money in the lab printing out possible choices for our final five pictures,” said DiGiovanni, a junior Photography major. “In the end, I feel much better prepared for my own future solo show.”
DiGiovanni’s interpretation of the Picture Perfect theme depicts frames within frames; her photos have an almost interactive feel, with a hand holding a frame within the pictures, isolating a part of the scene. “I’m a sucker for frames within a frame,” she said. “I love the geometrics it creates with strong leading lines. I wanted the viewers to see a very beautiful scene, but then also understand it takes a certain part of that scene to be Picture Perfect.”
Spending her summers as an assistant photo teacher at a summer camp, DiGiovanni hopes to one day own a studio, but still be a frequent traveler. “I’d be happy anywhere as long as I have my camera,” she noted. DiGiovanni has a solo exhibition in May 2014 at the Glen Cove Library.
Senior Art Education major Morgera’s interpretation of PicturePerfect sharply contrasted DiGiovanni and the other photographers, focusing on the naked female body, done in black and white. “I’ve seen the female body to always be perfect in any shape or form,” she said. “The black and white allows the photos to represent all other women, rather than the individual herself.”
Morgera is also interested in teaching the arts. “I hope to be able to have students become passionate about art like I am, or just get them to give art the respect and appreciation it deserves.”
It is clear from the exhibit that Post has fostered varied and talented artists. Not only do the works show individual talent, they also depict the dedication to sharing passion – be it in the classroom or in a gallery.

The Pioneers defeated the Mercy College Mavericks in the semi-finals, and the Dowling College Golden Lions in the finals to become the East Coast Conference Champions for the second year in a row.
LIU Post hosted Mercy College on Wednesday, Nov. 6 in the ECC semi-finals. The Mavericks were quick to start the game off, scoring just five minutes into the first period. The Pioneers leading scorer, junior forward Eivind Austboe, scored a goal for the home team less than 10 minutes later off an assist by sophomore midfielder Per Forgaard and senior midfielder Jonathon Watkin. For the remainder of the game, fans from both schools were on the edge of their seats. Last time the Pioneers and the Mavericks met, double overtime came and went, ending in a draw. With just 2.8 seconds left in regulation, Watkin successfully took a shot off a rebound by Austboe, winning the game, and sending the Pioneers to the ECC finals.
On Friday, Nov. 8, the Pioneers welcomed the Golden Lions to Brookville, N.Y. in the final battle for the 2013 ECC Championship. The game was scoreless through the first period and most of the second. With 11 minutes left in regulation, Austboe headed in the first goal of the game off an assist by senior back Eirik Bjoernoe. Dowling fought hard
to tie the score but less than 10 minutes later, freshman forward Johann Kristjansson scored another Pioneer goal off an assist by senior forward Cemil Turan. Dowling kept fighting to catch up, but their efforts fell short. In the last minutes of the game, Austboe scored again off another Bjoernoe assist. The Pioneers defeated Dowling 3-0, and for the second year in a row they can call themselves the East Coast Conference Champions.
Next up for the Pioneers is the NCAA Division II Championship. The men’s soccer team will host the first round of the national tournament, and as they claimed the number one seed in the east region they will have a bye in the first round. On Thursday, Nov. 14 Dowling College and NYIT face off at Robert Blitz field here at the campus of LIU Post for the right to play the Pioneers on Saturday, Nov. 16. Both games are slated for a 1 p.m. kickoff.

After a perfect season, with an 18-0 record, the LIU Post field hockey team hosted the Northeast-10 Conference Championship last weekend. On Friday, Nov. 8, the Pioneers overwhelmed fourth-seeded Adelphi University in the semi-finals. Sophomore Keliann Margiotta led the way for the Pioneers, by recording a hat-trick after just about 25 minutes of play. Thereafter, “The Green Machine” controlled the game by continuously attacking. Consequently, the Pioneers held a 17-5 advantage in shots, and their attacking mentality resulted in two more tallies. The 5-0 win made the Pioneers storm forward to the finals on Sunday, November 10.
With the home advantage, LIU Post carried on their successful season in the finals against Stonehill College. Immediately in the first half, forward Marie- Lynn Wilson tallied in her ninth goal for the season, putting the Pioneers in the leading position of the game. The finals remained tight for a long period, until Margiotta, the Most Outstanding Player of the Championship, doubled up the lead for LIU Post in the middle of the second half, making it her 25th for the season.
Stonehill would not give up without a fight, as the nation’s leading goalscorer, Erika Kelly, tallied in the reduction with less than seven minutes to go. However, Stonehill never managed to take another shot for the equalizer, and Post celebrated their Championship victory.
Head Coach Raenee Savin was overwhelmed with the perfect season so far. “I am so proud of everything that this team has accomplished this year, and so proud to be a part of LIU Post field hockey,” she said.
Head Coach Savin and the Pioneers now await their seeding in the upcoming NCAA Div. II Champi- onship, as they are looking to continue their perfect record. The Pioneers head straight to the Final Four starting Nov. 22 in Virginia Beach, Va.
