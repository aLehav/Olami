The Battle of the Boulev￼ard went down to the wire on Saturday, February 23 as the Lady Pioneers (18-7) upset the NYIT Lady Bears 71-62 behind the strong effort by sophomore guard Chelsea Williams. She dropped 19 points on an efficient 6-9 shoot- ing display from the floor. How- ever, she was cool under pres- sure when she nailed the most important shot of the game. With about 1:30 left in the second half, the Lady Bears chipped into the Lady Pioneers’ lead and made it a two-point game, 64-62. It felt as if the game may have been slip- ping away, but Williams drained a three-pointer making the score 67-62. The Lady Bears were un- able to recover after that point and the Lady Pioneers pumped their fists as they left the floor after knocking off a Lady Bears team that entered the game with a 22-2 record.
Despite a massive 33 turn- overs, the Lady Pioneers found a way to pull out a victory. One major reason why the Lady Pio- neers were able to take come away victorious was because they won the total rebounding battle against the Lady Bears 51-36. The ladies now have a record of 17-3 when they have more rebounds than their opponent.
The win against a rival so late in the season was crucial, but it was also a well-earned win on Senior Day. The Lady Pioneers honored its three seniors: for- ward Nicolette Marciniak, center Samantha Kopp, and guard Ashley Caggiano. All three contributed in the win in their final regular sea- son home game at the Pratt Cen- ter. Marciniak notched her eighth double-double of the season with 15 points and 11 rebounds. Al- though she converted only one of her shot attempts, Kopp finished with nine points, 11 rebounds and two blocks. Off the bench, Cag- giano played solid defense, grab- bing four rebounds and dishing out three assists.
To immediately begin the contest, the Lady Bears jumped out to a quick 6-0 lead within the first 90 seconds of play. However, junior guard Kenyatta Sears eased her team with a three-pointer to answer NYIT and make it 6-3. This may have been the Lady Pioneers’ first made basket, but it was significant because before that shot NYIT started the game with more emotion. After that basket, LIU controlled the tempo.
A big reason for the Lady Pioneers upsetting the No. 17 na- tionally ranked Lady Bears was the disparity the two teams shot frombehind the arc. The Pioneers relied on the three-ball and went 8-16 from deep. On the other hand, the Lady Bears only went 2-15.
In their limited time off the bench, juniors Nijah LaCourt, Shayna Gatling and Jalicia Connell all contributed. LaCourt hauled in eight rebounds in 10 minutes of action, Gatling chipped in with a couple of buckets, and Connell made one of the eight three-point- ers that the Pioneers buried.
With the win against NYIT, the Lady Pioneers have now won four consecutive games and their final regular season game is on Saturday, March 2 on the road against Molloy College (9-15) at 12 p.m.
The Lady Pioneers are in fourth place in the ECC with an 11-6 conference record. The seeding has yet to be determined for the ECC Tournament which is scheduled to begin starting Wednesday, March 6.

Long Island University will offer four paid research summer internships for students inter- ested in working alongside the nation’s top experts in biology, psychology and neuroscience.
The chosen students will receive $3,000 and up to $500 for research materials. The LIU Office of Academic Affairs, the Provost’s Office, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sci- ences and the Biology Department are sponsoring the internship.
The internships will consist of a 10-week research project, within these fields, from June 2 to August 12, 2013, with profes- sors from these three depart-ments. Internships are open to undergraduate students from LIU Post and from other univer-sities throughout the country.
Students at an undergradu- ate level nationwide are free to apply, according to Dr. Matthew Draud, chairperson of the Biol-ogy department and participat- ing faculty member.
The internships are self- funded by LIU Post with the goal of receiving a grant from The National Science Founda- tion, according to Draud. “The hopes are that this grant will be received within five years as a result of good research and hard work,” said Draud.
The participating faculty members are Dr. Draud, from the Biology department, who focuses on diamondback ter- rapins, a species of turtle; Dr. Grace Rossi, from the Psychol- ogy department, who focuses on the pharmacological char- acteristics of the opioid system through the use of molecular and behavioral techniques; Dr. Karin Melkonian, from the Biol- ogy department, who focuses on the antimicrobial testing of modified carbohydrate- and protein-based surfaces. The sev-en other leading scientists, who are professors from LIU Post, will also work with the interns in conducting the research.
This is the second summer that the paid internships are offered. Last year, Nichole A. Ginnan, a senior Biology major, was one of the four students who was part of the internship program. She worked with Dr. Kent Hatch, an assistant Biology professor at LIU Post, to re- search how toe clipping affects amphibians’ survival and/or growth rate. Hatch will also be a part of this summer’s research.
“[It] has been the number one best learning experience in my undergraduate career here at LIU Post,” said Ginnan. “The internship has led to other op- portunities and has given me hands-on learning experience that you cannot receive in a class room setting.”
Ginnan added that when she was conducting the re- search, she was unaware of the incredible opportunity she received and its benefits. “Not only did this research make my resume stronger, it gave me confidence and pride in my work,” she said. “I also hope to publish my research as a first author, which is a huge accomplishment as an undergraduate. It will look spectacular when I apply to graduate school.”
Melanie Bram, a junior Biology major, was also one of last summer’s interns. She worked with Dr. April Blakeslee, assis- tant professor of Biology at LIU Post, to research the influence of the trematode parasite cycle on the behavior and psychology of introduced populations of European Green Crab in eastern North America.
It was the first research initiative she ever participated in and she said that it taught her how experiments are con- ducted and the methodology behind them. She added, “The part I enjoyed most about this experience was not only investigating further into my topic of study, but also learning a lot about research being done by other students in the program. For instance, I learned a lot about turtles and frogs and how they’re being studied that I had no prior knowledge about.”
Last year, one of the four interns was from Miami Oxford University in Ohio and the other three from LIU Post. This year, the program expects around 30 applicants, compared to last year’s 11 applicants. “It is a very prestigious internship,” said Draud.
Applicants will also get their chance to choose which of the three different projects they are interested in. If more than one student wants to work with the same professor, they will be assigned to that professor.
The internship program is looking for ambitious, independent and passionate students who can work well with others and who can take criticism, according to Draud. He said it is important to have strong letters of recommenda- tion that will help the program see that interns will produce successful research.
Ginnan stated that the in- ternship is very demanding and it involves a lot of hard work. “I would recommend applying for the internship to hardworking and self-motivated mature stu- dents,” she said. “The internship was so much fun and I learned many valuable things, but it was a lot of hard work. You must enjoy science and research and be willing to put in the time and energy.”
Bram said that she would encourage students who would like to learn more about labora- tory and field research to apply for this internship.
For more information and the application, students may go to http://www.liu.edu/ post/suri. The application is due by March 1, 2013, and it may be handed into the LIU Post Biology department. Can- didates will be notified of the status of their applications by March 15, 2013.

Between classes, school assignments, possibly a job, and socializing, college students’ schedules are often completely booked. Nowhere in the schedule does it call for sleep.
Why do college students feel sleep is so unnecessary? When LIU Post students were asked about sleep, they felt that it gives them less time to study or do homework. They be- lieve that sleep only slows them down when occupied with schoolwork rather than help- ing them succeed.
Nikki Merkle, a sophomore psychology major, says, “I unfortunately lost sleep because of schoolwork. I was able to have more time available to study and I felt that extra time helped me get more time to understand the information that would be on the test, resulting in a good grade. I just wish that I was able to get a good night’s sleep beforehand.”
Although the National Sleep Founda- tion reports that there is no actual perfect time period for sleep because people’s bodies function differently, it recommends that one would be most productive with seven hours of sleep. It says college students should get around six to eight hours of sleep, depend- ing on the student’s body type and sleeping habits.
The Harvard Women’s Health Watch also stresses how sleep is important for every person. After a conducted an experi- ment in 2006, it proved that sleep im- proves learning and memory because sleep helps give the brain time to store new data through the method of “Memory Consolidation”. According to the Harvard Women’s Health Watch, memory consolidation is the process involved in coding a memory so that it can be retrieved later.
Sleep, according to these studies, helps students have more knowledge of what they learned in class. Some students at LIU Post may be aware of how important sleep is, but they do not always put it first.
Ashley Appell, a freshman early-child- hood education major says, “I should get more sleep than I do now. I should be going to sleep earlier but I get less sleep partly because of schoolwork and partly because of social reasons.”
In an up-to-date statistic from LIU Post, almost 70 percent of LIU Post students com- mute to school, it is an important question of whether or not they are at risk of falling asleep behind the wheel due to lack of sleep.
It is also dangerous to be behind the wheel of a car when one is deprived of sleep. By falling asleep, drivers tend to swerve, which can lead to car collisions, either with another car or the driver crashing into a random object. According to Drivers.com, more than 10 percent of people have admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel. Dana Bettex, a junior Education major, says “I have never fallen asleep while driving but when I’m tired I try my best to listen to music hoping that it will wake me up a little, even though sometimes it is ineffective.”
Sleep is an important process for stu- dents to have. Schedules, however, get in the way of this, resulting in sleepless nights and the zombie-like feeling one has almost every morning. Knowing what sleepless nights feel like, a schedule that prevents sleep is a curse that I do not wish on my worst enemy.
From past experiences of going through weeks at a time without enough sleep, it is a bittersweet experience. At first, I had more time to study the night before tests and the all-nighters helped me finish papers earlier than I would have if I had went to bed at a normal time, in addition to the more than three or four hours of sleep. What I have learned is that this technique can only work if this happens once in a while. Also, you should take a nap after you submit your pa- per or hand in your exam, followed by a good night’s sleep. If you constantly work for multiple days without sleeping, it will only affect you negatively and make you more prone to becoming constantly exhausted.
Hopefully LIU Post students will be able to budget and organize their time in order to make room for sleep. It is proven by sources, such as the Harvard Women’s Health Watch, that if students do organize times for sleep, it will help set decent sleeping patterns, mak- ing them feel well-rested and more willing
to work harder on whatever their schedule revolves around, whether it is school, sports, jobs, or life in general.

Remember the anxious, stressful days of waiting for your report card in the mail? It would go one of two ways. Either you were going to be grounded for a month because of your lack of commitment to your schoolwork, or bragged about to everyone in your family for the rest of the year for your amazing academic achievements. These were the days when a parent could simply call up a school and ask for their child’s records and it would be handed them the next day. Thanks to FERPA this all ends the day we turn 18 or move on to a form of schooling beyond the high school level.
FERPA (Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act) was made to protect the privacy of a student’s educational records. Under this federal law, once a student turns 18 they become an “eligible student.” This means that now only the student and faculty of the school they are attending are able to access their grades.
The parents who are paying for their children to attend a university may think this is unfair. There are parents who pay for their children to go to school and are never aware that they are just passing by or may not even be passing at all. Matthew McMahon, a sophomore broadcasting major, sides with the law but thinks that there should be an agreement between the parent and child that makes both sides feel more comfortable. McMahon said, “I think they deserve to know how their child is doing because they are paying a lot of money for them to attend school. However, it should really be up to the student and parent to work together to come up with a way that makes them both feel good about it.”
The parents may believe that this law only affects them but it certainly has to do with the students as well. We would assume that most students would not want their parents to access their grades just in case they are not giving their schoolwork all they have but there are students who agree that the law is unnecessary. When asked what she thought of FERPA, Meagan Kolakowski, a sopho- more dance major, said, “When my parents were paying my tuition, I thought it was fair because college is an investment for them be- cause it is so much money. I think them being able to see if you are doing well or not is fair because then they get to see if it was actually a good or bad investment. ”
When asked the same question, Giovan- ni Marcenaro, a sophomore computer sci- ence major, had mixed feelings about the law. “I think that the parents should be able to see the grades because they are paying for the schooling but at the same time I feel that if you’re not doing your best it’s embarrass- ing,” Marcenaro said. “You don’t want your parents to be ashamed and disappointed in you. I think the law has good and bad ele- ments to it.”
Both sides have great arguments but for now the law is the law. However, if you want your parents to have access to your grades to assure them that they are making the right decision by paying for you to get a higher education there are ways to do so. You and your parent would need to sign a FERPA waiver, giving your parent or guardian ac- cess to your records. You could also just give them a print out of your online report card at the end of ach semester. It is a good idea to let them see that you are working hard and that when it comes to school you don’t need a privacy law. The law thinks that once we are 18 we should cut off our parent’s ability to check up on our grades but more impor- tantly, what do you think?

The Office of Residence Life requires Resident Assistants (RA) on campus to host four programs each semester for the residents in their dorm buildings. Programs can range from hall wars to lectures. However, it is very difficult to have students attend.
Some RAs admit that they do not expect a high level of attendance. The purpose of these programs is to educate and build relationships between RAs and residents. Although most of the programs are held in a study lounge, the RAs decide where to host the program.
RA and senior Marketing major, Sanger De Vine, said he has experienced the disappointment of holding programs where few students have showed interest. He called his first program, “Beach Ball Social,” which was created for residents to get to know each other. Unfortunately, only a couple of students showed up.
However, he held a sexually transmitted disease awareness seminar called, “Let’s Talk About Sex,” where he offered free condoms. Fifteen students attended this relatively popular program. “Is it a problem that students don’t show a lot of interest in our programs? No. But it is sad,” he said, pointing out that he spends a lot of time planning the programs.
RA and junior Earth Science Education major, Natasha Vaughn, planned to hold an event called, “Social Media Showdown,” where she would show students how to use social media and how to explore how much information on each student is on the web. However, the program was canceled because only two students showed up. In order for it to be a successful program, there has to be at least five or more students, according to Vaughn.
“I think RA programs are kind of a waste. I recently went to one, and only me and someone else showed up because it was something to do,” said junior International Business major, Nicole Urbonas.
“It’s like I’m doing a lot of work for nothing,” Vaughn said. This is her second semester being an RA. She believes that there is a lot that RAs can do to get more people to attend programs such as putting up more flyers and holding the programs at a more convenient place like the dorm lobby.
However, for some students, the RA programs might be worth attending. “Some of them are fun because you get to meet new people and what not, it all depends on the program,” said junior Criminal Justice major, Craig Roth. His favorite program was one where he paid to throw a pie in a RA or Residence Hall Director’s face.
The RA programs that some students seem to find popular are the ones that include other dorms and those that get everyone involved, according to De Vine. He held a program at SUNY Canton, where he also was an RA, called, “Speed-dating in February,” which had a huge turnout. He is thinking about doing a similar program here at Post.
The most popular program in Brookville Hall last semester was called, “Sex Jeopardy,” said Brookville Hall RA Tina-Marie Fisco. She estimated that between 30 to 40 students showed up.
RAs are required to hold these programs in order to build a sense of community. A program proposal must be submitted to a Senior RA (SRA). It is then reviewed again two weeks prior to the date it is supposed to be held, once it has been approved. RAs choose what kind of event they want to do, as long as it is approved, Fisco said.
For more information on future programs, contact the Office of Residence Life Staff at 516-299-2326.

Say Anything Improv, LIU Post’s improvisational acting group, presented its first program of the semester, called Black Comedy, in the Hillwood Cinema. On February 20, the club decided to recognize several African American comedians and their contributions to the world of comedy in order to observe Black History Month. Some of the comedians honored included Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock and Wanda Sykes.
During the free event, 13 video clips depicting the comedic styles of Bill Cosby, Kevin Hart, Donald Glover, Wanda Sykes, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Richard Pryor, Patrice O’Neal, Dave Chapelle and Whoopi Goldberg played for an hour. Some students in the audience had the skits memorized and recited the acts, especially those of Kevin Hart and Eddie Murphy.
In between the comedy clips, members of Say Anything asked trivia questions about the comedians. There were three rounds of questions and candy was distributed to the winners. Some of the questions ranged from how long the Wanda Sykes Show had been on air to naming Kevin Hart’s comedy sequences. Students were anxiously screaming to answer the questions and jumping up to catch the candy thrown into the air.
This segment helped club members inform students on the accomplishments of the African American comedians. While some audience members knew the information, others left with new knowledge, which according to Say Anything Improv, was the ultimate goal.
Junior Musical Theatre major, Emily Crowe, said, “I’ve been to several Say Anything events so I expected them to improvise some standup [routines]. I was surprised when they used clips, but they were extremely funny.”
Freshman Psychology major, Jessy Pierre, said, “Every part of the program was enjoyable. Say Anything did a great job.”
Say Anything Improv, which originally started at LIU Brooklyn, brought a new chapter to LIU Post in 2008. The purpose of the club is to provide a welcoming environment for people who want to learn improvisational acting and meet others who are interested.
Say Anything Improv is affiliated with The Bedtime Brothers improvisational group as well as Post’s drama club, Emerging Student Theatre Artists (E.S.T.A).  E.S.T.A. is a club for aspiring theatrical artists on LIU Post campus.
The Bedtime Brothers is a New York City-based improvisation duo consisting of two men named Brandon and Neal, which originated in Nebraska. The duo performs throughout New York and recently appeared at LIU Post on January 26, 2013, to perform a show called Il Tragide de Lorenzo in the Little Theatre.
Members of Say Anything Improv show their love for the club and encourage everyone to try the club. “This club is about having fun and enjoying improvisational acting,” said Joshua Cahn, Vice President of Say Anything Improv.
According to President Shelby Wellington, “A lot of people come in saying they cannot perform improv; I always say, if you can have a conversation with somebody, you can definitely do improv.”
The club’s executive board consists of the Coach Sean Costello, President Shelby Wellington, Vice President Joshua Cahn and Treasurer Douglass Robinson.
General meetings for Say Anything Improv are Mondays from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the Pioneer Room in Hillwood Commons. Future events are planned and will be promoted on the club’s social media sites as well as fliers around the campus. For more information, visit the Facebook page “Say Anything Improv” or email the club at sayanythingimprov@yahoo.com.

Lately, the talk around campus is that the dorming policy had changed without students being aware of it. The policy, which requires students to be in good standing with the Financial Services Office and Bursar before applying for room selection, has not changed though, according to Jennifer Fuoco, director of Residence Life.
“Residents have always needed to be clear in order to obtain a stamp for their application at the Student Financial Services Office prior to turning it in to Residence Life,” Fuoco added.
The LIU Post website indicates that to be eligible for on-campus housing, students must be registered for full-time classes.
However, many students who live on campus have different views on the current dorming policy. “I didn’t start my housing applications yet, but I haven’t heard anything about paying bills before we can dorm,” said Talia Charlton, a junior Journalism major. “I never even knew that was the school’s dorm rules.”
“I was not fully aware of what the policy exactly was. No one made it clear to me that we had to pay our bill and register for classes before we are able to enter the housing lottery on campus,” said Melissa Weisman, a sophomore Speech Pathology major. “This is frustrating because I feel like our school never informs us the right way.”
Several students said that they previously did not have to have their college tuition bills up to date to apply for dorms; rather they just had to pay a $300 deposit with their housing application to be entered into the dorm room “lottery” process. Students fill out their housing form and must take it stamped to Residence Life by April 5, 2013. Lottery tickets became available at Residence Life on April 10 and 11, 2013. Students are given a “lottery” ticket according to their last name.
Each ticket has a number and time on.  On April 12, 2013, room selection occurs and students report to the Long Island Room in the Winnick Student Center based on their lottery time. Students may then choose their building and room they would prefer to dorm in.
Residents must also be registered for full-time classes for the upcoming Fall 2013 semester in order to reserve the room of their choice during room selection. If any returning residents are unable to participate in room selection, they are still able to apply for housing once they obtain a stamp for their application. Those students are then assigned a room once they are registered for classes.
According to the Bursar’s policies, students with past due balances greater than $500 will be prevented from engaging in University activities, such as registering for classes.  If students cannot register for classes, they cannot apply for housing.
Some students disagree with the current dorm policy. “I think it is unfair that students cannot apply for dorms and register for classes unless their bills are paid,” said Alyssa Yannuzzi, a sophomore Public Relations major. “Some students are in tough financial situations and should not be penalized for that,” she added.
“This is my second year living on-campus and I hate the dorm process,” said Yannuzzi. “Waiting on numerous lines for the ‘lottery’ is already annoying and on top of that we have to worry about registering for classes and paying bills,” she added.
Students must submit their housing forms before May 1, 2013, to be guaranteed housing and then wait until August to find out what residence hall they will call home the next semester. For more information on the policy, contact the Office of Residence Life at (516) 299-2326.

In order to graduate, LIU students must pass four competency requirements (computer literacy, library use, oral communication and writing). However, many students complain about the difficulty level of these tests and the computer workshop. Additionally, numerous students question the necessity of the information presented.
According to the LIU Post website, students must fulfill the competency requirements prior to junior year or 60 credits, whichever occurs first. This requirement has been a part of the school’s curriculum for more than 20 years.
Completing this requirement means students must prove proficient in computer literacy and library use. This can be exhibited through an examination or by enrolling in a workshop. It is also possible to take the CLA 6 (Computer Literacy) class to fulfill the computer literacy requirement.
The oral communication requirement is offered either through an exam or by enrolling in ORC 1 (Public Speaking), ORC 17 (Speech Communication in Organizations) or SPH 5 (Voice and Diction). Also, the writing competency is offered through English 1 and English 2 courses.
Some students say that there is a significant difference in difficulty level between the computer test and the other exams. “I found the library test easier than the computer test and that the questions and intellectual material presented on the library exam were much more useful,” said Maria Emdal Otterlei, a junior Broadcasting major.
Otterlei passed the exams, but was worried about failing, which meant she would have to enroll in the computer literacy workshop that takes place once a week for five weeks.
Based on the information presented in the exam, Otterlei said that she did not see why students would benefit from the workshop. “Knowing what and how to use the library as a resource is much more important than knowing HTML codes in my opinion,” she added. “A lot of the information on the computer literacy test felt irrelevant to my major, and having to enroll in a time-consuming workshop when you have so much other schoolwork to do would not be necessary.”
One of the reasons why the computer exam might be seem difficult is that, according to. Christopher Malinowski, associate professor and director of Graduate Studies in the department of Computer Science/Management and Engineering, the department that offers the computer literacy exam, there is more emphasis on “technology literacy.” He added that the computer competency exam and workshop offer information and knowledge that students should have upon graduating.
“With the convergence of computers and such technology, students need to be aware of the much broader technological spectrum in order to be competent in their professional and personal lives,” he said. “There are also implications in technology usage that many students and professionals are not aware of, which may put their personal information at risk,” he added.
Some students did not find the information useful and wonder if they will ever use it in the future. Junior Film major Tore Hynnekleiv passed the computer literacy test, but said that the exam was too detailed and that he understands why people fail. “The computer test was a blend of utterly easy questions like, “What is Microsoft Word and Excel?” combined with very specific questions like, “What do you use a SCSI cable for?” I can imagine many stumbling on that one” he said.
Hynnekleiv said he also found the questions outdated. “I remember that they asked me about CD-RAM, which basically no one uses anymore. Most people don’t know what that is, and will never need to either.”
In addition, some students say that detailed language and technical terms present obstacles. Sophomore International Business major Berit Andrea Grav found the computer competency exam difficult due to language barriers. “I’m an international student from Norway and for many of the questions, I did not always understand what it asked. I even brought a dictionary and it didn’t help,” she added.
Potula Anagnostakos, a junior Journalism major, suggested that instead of a system of tests and mandatory workshops, the information and knowledge that the school wants students to have could be integrated into the coursework. “If we could work more in computer labs and do more in-class research in library databases, perhaps we would not need the system we have now,” she said. “I am sure students would prefer that instead of stressing out about having missed the 60-credit deadline or failing the tests.”
Barbara Fowles, chair of the Media Arts department and professor of Electronic Media understands the students’ point of view, but still sees the necessity for the competency exams. “I know that students can feel that the tests are silly and outdated, but my understanding is that they are now more updated and much more relevant.” She also believes that having college core requirements is a good way to structure undergraduate education. “Irrelevant or not, it is much better for every student to have a very broad knowledge so that you are open to more career choices. Knowing more will also make you a smarter citizen,” she added.
To register for the exams, students may e-mail post-compexam@liu.edu with their first and last name, student identification number and MyLIU username. Students should also include the date and time of the exam they want to register for. Schedules are available on the LIU Post website. Students should wait for a confirmation e-mail and bring their student or photo ID and student ID number to the exam. For the oral communications competency exam, students may call 516-299-2436.

The LIU Post Recycling Program began a new initiative to improve recycling on campus. Students can enter a raffle to win $200 dining dollars by recycling chips bags, which are not traditionally recyclable.
Aramark, LIU Post’s dining services, sponsors the raffle. Students may use dining dollars at the Hillwood Café, Starbucks, Subway and other food places around campus.
All students or faculty members with or without meal plans may also win the $200 dining dollars. The money will be credited to the winner’s account and will act as a free meal plan. The contest will end in March and the winner will be drawn from the raffle in April. There will be only one winner.
“By the end of the semester dining dollars are almost gone, so the person that wins will have a lot of money to eat for the rest of the semester,” said Billy Achnitz, Enviornmental Sustainability graduate student and coordinator of the campus recycling program, which is designed to help Post reduce waste by promoting recycling throughout campus.
To enter the raffle you must have a punch card found near the cashier registers in Hillwood Café and the Information Desk in Hillwood Commons. Participants will get a punch for every bag of chips they donate to the Information Desk in Hillwood Commons. For every 20 punches a person receives on the card, their name is entered into the raffle once.
For the chip bag initiative, the recycling program teamed up with Terracycle, a Trenton, New Jersey company that collects non-recyclable items and converts it into new products such as binders, notebooks and even park benches.
According to Achnitz, Terracycle donates two cents per chip bag to Post. The donated money goes into a scholarship fund ran by the recycling program that students from any major can apply for. The program expects to raise $1,000 for the scholarship. Since the initiative began, the program has raised about $70 so far.
“Hopefully through the raffle that we are doing we can increase the number [of donated chip bags] and get some more money donated from Terracycle,” said Achnitz.
The focus of the recycling program has been the traditional recycling of plastics, cans and papers. This is the third year that the Recycling Program has been working with Terracycle; however, it has only been a side project until recently.
The program has also added 20 new Dasani bottle bins around campus in almost every building, which cost $1,000 each. The Dasani bottle bins are in the shape of a water bottle that reads, “Please Recycle Bottles and Cans Here,” with a large recycling symbol. Any beverage containers can be recycled in those containers. The recycling bins were donated to the University by the Coca-Cola/Keep America Beautiful Recycling Bin Grant Program, which supports recycling on college campuses by providing the bins for the collection of beverage container recyclables.
To receive the grant, the college must apply and prove to the company how they will try to promote recycling on campus.
“I recycle when I can find the bottle things [Dasani bottle bins] or paper garbages, but they’re missing sometimes,” said Taylor Inesta, freshman Music Education major. She is a commuter student who spends much of her time in the Fine Arts Center, Kahn Discovery Center, Humanities and Hillwood Commons.
The Dasani bottle bins can be found in Hillwood, the library, Pell Hall, Kahn Discovery Hall, the Pratt Center, Lorber Hall and the Fine Arts Building. Traditional recycling bins are in every building as well.
Achnitz said that recycling bins are typically found in the lobby on the first floor of buildings on campus. Bins are placed in areas where students will gather with a lot of cans. In the Residence Halls, no glass is collected because it can be a safety hazard for the student workers who have to empty the bins. The student workers are Environmental Assistants who empty and collect recycled items from the bins monthly and bring them to be recycled. The Recycling Program hires them.
Alex Couto, freshman Chemistry major, feels that it is hard to recycle on campus. Although he saves his water bottles with the best intentions, it is difficult for him to find recycling bins. “I just end up throwing them all away,” he said.
Achnitz hopes that through the chip bag initiative, the added recycling bins and the other programs the Recycling Program are currently developing, the club will help Post reach its goal of having the least amount of waste on campus.

The U.S. and Germany have had a long and complicated history, to say the least. After fighting two world wars against Germany in the 20th century, the U.S. established a large military presence in the country to guard against the Soviet Union, a presence which, nevertheless, continues to this day and has produced a strange phenomenon with regards to soccer in both countries.
In 2011, 70 years after the U.S. and Germany declared war on each other, the U.S. national soccer team hired a German coach to lead them to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The new coach, Jurgen Klinsman, is a former player for Tottenham Hotspur in London and also coached Germany to a third- place finish at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. What has caught the attention of American soccer fans during Klinsman’s first two years in charge is that he has invited many German- American players to the American national side. What’s re- markable about this move is that all of these players Klinsman has brought on were born and raised in Germany, speak German, and play for German teams. In fact, most of them had previously represented Germany in interna- tional competitions.
The fact that these players are eligible to play for America is due to the fact that each of their fathers had served in Germany with the U.S. military after World War Two. If the American na- tional team‘s current roster is any indication, the U.S. may field five such German-speaking players in their starting lineup at the 2014 World Cup. This is certainly a unique phenomenon in Ameri- can sports and was highlighted
in a 2012 profile by ESPN. When asked by ESPN why he chose to play for the U.S. instead of Ger- many, Danny Williams, who plays for TSG Hoffenheim along with fellow German-American Fabian Johnson, Williams said that even after growing up in Germany and playing for German teams he still did not feel as if he was accepted as a ‘real German’ by his German compatriots, most likely, one imagines, because his father was an American serviceman of African descent.
Americans, Williams added, are better at accepting people who are different than them than Germans are. After all, America has always been more of a het- erogeneous society than most European countries. However, coach Klinsman is not bringing so many German-American play- ers onto the team simply for the sake of diversity. All but one of these players play in the German Bundesliga, one of the best soccer leagues in the world. Indeed, one of them, midfielder Jermaine Jones of Schalke, scored a crucial goal in a Champions league match in February against Galatasaray, a Turkish team which featured superstar players Didier Drogba and Wesley Sneijder, formerly of Chelsea and Inter Milan, respectively.
Thanks to Jurgen Klinsman, the U.S. national side will not be short on talent. Nevertheless, as evidenced by its 2-1 World Cup qualifying loss to Honduras in early February, its biggest con- cern between now and in the World Cup finals in Brazil in 2014 will be finding a way to play as a team. The team may have talent, but against Honduras it looked like a collection of individuals each looking to make their own mark. The next qualifying game for the American side will be on March 22 against Costa Rica in Colorado.
If his comments at the USC School of Journalism event in February are any indication, former U.S. national team player and all-time leading scorer Land- on Donovan might be rejoining the national side for its upcoming qualifiers. Donovan’s last game with the team was in an August, 2012 win in Mexico but he has not been featured with the national side since then, having taken a sabbatical of sorts from soccer in order to ‘rediscover’ himself. Hopefully, if the U.S. is able to regain its former scoring leader and finally play together as a coherent unit, unlike its performance in Honduras, there just might be a chance of the U.S. pulling an upset in Brazil next year.

After witnessing the change in light bulbs and the removal of electric doors this semester, students on campus began discussing whether the renovations were caused by the University’s high electric bill. However, William Kirker, director of Facilities Services disproved this rumor.
“I have not heard of the rumor that our electric bill is too high,” said Kirker. Yet, it is true that the University has removed electric doors in Hillwood and the library, swapped existing lights for energy efficient bulbs and shut off heating in major buildings, such as Humanities, during periods when students are not on campus, including Winter Recess.
According to Kirker, LIU Post pays close attention to its energy consumption. “We track our electric and gas consumption at our major meter points on a daily basis. We also track our electric and gas at all locations on a monthly basis,” he added. Not only does the university closely track the electric, but also natural gas. Natural gas is used to heat all of the buildings and to generate hot water.
According to Kirker, consumption has decreased and rates have varied slightly. “We have a few rates that we pay depending on the size of the service, but our average rate right now is about $0.165/KWh. We are using less energy than we did seven years ago,” explained Kirker.
Additionally, Kirker stated that LIU Post has implemented many energy saving initiatives throughout the past five years. “Our electric bill has probably decreased by about 6 percent over the past five years. Our consumption of electricity has decreased by over 8 percent for the same five years,” said Kirker.
Buildings on campus now use energy efficient lighting. “We are replacing the remaining less efficient lighting in Pell Hall now and will be going back into Hillwood, Humanities, Fine Arts, Music and Sculpture buildings shortly,” said Kirker.
The campus is currently undergoing a major fixture replacement in several of its buildings. The old fluorescent T12 fixtures will be replaced with more efficient fluorescent T8 fixtures.
This project is scheduled to be completed within the next couple of months. “We have been installing these types of fixtures in all buildings on campus whenever we did any kind of renovation. A T8 fixture is our standard. We are now going through and doing the remainder as we are getting a rebate from LIPA for doing so,” said Kirker.
The rebate depends on the type of fixtures. Since the fixtures change from time to time, it is difficult to determine how much the rebate will be. According to Kirker, the University will install other types of lighting such as Light-emitting diode (LED) technology wherever it may be applicable. LED is a device that converts electricity to light by using the movement of electrons.
“Lighting technologies are always changing, what was installed 30 years ago is more efficient than 50 years ago.” According to Kirker, LED is one of the most efficient lights right now, however, the fixtures that house the LEDs may not be applicable for campus settings like classrooms and offices. The LED fixtures can be very costly ranging from $75 to $400. Therefore, there is no financial benefit to installing them. “Each application of lighting is evaluated independently,” said Kirker.
The automatic doors used at Hillwood and the library have been replaced with traditional doors because, according to Kirker, those kinds of doors require constant repair due to breakage. “The costs to repair these doors were becoming unreasonable. These doors were not replaced as an energy saving measure,” he added.
The second reason the doors were changed is that employees stationed by the doors were hit with a blast of cold air for an extended amount of time during the winter months. Automatic doors stay open longer than traditional doors, according to Kirker, so replacing them was necessary to keep the excessive cold out of the buildings.
Junior Journalism major, Potula Anagnostakos, appreciates any attempt that the University makes to be energy efficient. “It’s a good idea. Not only is it benefiting the University, but students can also learn what it takes to become energy efficient,” said Anagnostakos.
The former automatic doors enabled easy accessibility, so the replacement raised concerns for those who depend on them to gain access to the buildings. However, Kirker ensured that, “These new door replacements will not affect anyone with a disability. All entrances still have an automatic door that can be activated by a push button.”
Freshman Broadcasting major, Charlie Moerler, who uses a motorized wheelchair feels that his navigation through the campus is seamless. According to Moerler, Facilities is open to suggestions and responds quickly. “In my case, they [the Facilities employees] increased times on doors opening and closing, made WCWP (the campus radio station) handicap accessible and put tables in rooms that needed them,” said Moerler. However, “In the event that there is not an automatic door, [like classrooms] people gladly hold the door open without me even having to ask,” he added.
According to Kirker, variable frequency drives (VFDs) will be installed on pumps and air handlers. VFDs are systems used in air conditioners to adjust motor speed to match output requirements and save energy. Energy management controls on heating and cooling equipment will be installed too. Heating and cooling equipment that is not energy efficient will be replaced with equipment that is more efficient.
A solar panel system was installed at the Facilities building during summer 2011. Solar panels convert solar light into energy. “Solar panels are a great way to lower energy costs and generate green renewable energy,” said Kirker.
Kirker explained that although money is saved instantly when a solar panel is installed, the cost of installation is very expensive. The solar panel installation at LIU Post was about $45,000 after the LIPA rebate. According to Kirker, it will take the campus 14 years to start saving money because of this installation.
In 2008, a geothermal cooling system was installed at the Winnick House and Mullarkey Hall for air conditioning purposes. This system operates through sub-surface conductive heat transfer using the temperature of the earth’s crust as a heat source in the winter and as a heat sink in the summer.
It also takes a while to see a return on investment with geothermal cooling systems. Kirker explained that the benefit of having a geothermal cooling system is that there is no outdoor mechanical equipment. Any machinery, which would be installed outside of the building normally, is installed underground.
Sophomore Journalism major, Michelle Morey, agreed with the University’s choices of using energy efficient technologies. “More schools should be energy efficient, these changes will affect everyone in the long run,” said Morey. She is currently learning about alternative energy sources and their benefits. “Switching the light bulbs and doors is a start but there is still a lot more that the school can do, solar panels are a start but they can be more sustainable too.” Morey suggests that the University could try to use less plastic in Hillwood and give incentives to students and faculty who do so.
Although LIU Post is not suffering from exceedingly high electric bills, it will continue to move forward with energy-efficient initiatives. “Adding Energy Management Controls has a long way to go. Lighting will keep progressing so we will keep an eye on new options,” said Kirker.
The University will continue to track energy consumption to make sure it does not increase. In addition, LIU Post is working on a new green office program, which will begin the pilot stage soon. It will attempt to reduce the University’s carbon footprint along with energy consumption. Other solar panel systems will also be researched.
“We are constantly looking at how to make things last longer. It may be with better materials or higher quality equipment. These things usually cost more, but [it] can be worth it in the end. We are also constantly looking at how to reduce consumption of natural resources,” said Kirker.

The Pioneers ended the home portion of their regular season with a nail-biting loss on Saturday, February 23 against the NYIT Bears. The loss was only the Pioneers’ third at home this season. A second half come- back and two late-game free throws did the Pioneers in against the East Coast Confer- ence rivals.
In the loss, the Pioneers shot 43 percent from the field, but just 18 percent from three- point range. Junior forward Vaughn Allen led the team in points with 18 and also hauled in 11 rebounds. Senior guard Tobin Carberry contributed 15 points along with two assists and one steal. Sophomore forward Tyuan Wil- liams finished the game with 10 points and eight rebounds.
The Bears jumped to an early first half lead, but the Pioneers would keep it close, not allowing NYIT to get more than a three point lead. LIU Post got their first lead of the half at the 16:06 mark off a bucket from Allen, but NYIT regained their lead just seconds later. The lead changed 16 times before the end of half, which would end in a 32-32 tie.
The second half saw the Pioneers jump ahead off a jumper by Allen. The Bears again answered back, but this time LIU Post was able to jump into the lead and put some space between itself and NYIT. Carberry completed a three-point play and then buried a three-point shot several moments later to give the Pioneers a six-point lead.
At the 14:02 mark, freshman guard Emile Blackman made it a 10-point game in favor of the Pioneers. Five minutes later he gave them a 54-41 advantage.
However, junior guard Phil Izevbehai led the Bears’ comeback scoring eight of NYIT’s next 10 points to cut the deficit to just three. Blackman made it 56-51 at the 7:04 mark, but sophomore forward Charles McCann fouled Bears’ junior forward Markus Moore moments later. Moore hit both of his free throws and Bears’ senior guard Antoine Brown’s basket cut the Pioneers lead to 56-55
The Pioneers pushed their lead to four, but the Bears again rallied. With 2:34 left
to play, the Bears took their first lead of the half. They extended their lead to four points before Allen and Blackman cut it to just a one-point contest.
The Bears held on for the victory thanks to two made free throws with 19 seconds left. The Pioneers got one last shot to tie the game, but a last second three-pointer missed the mark and NYIT held on to win 65-62.
This loss against NYIT moves the Pio- neers into a tie for third place in the East Coast Conference with the Bears. Their final game of the regular season is on Saturday, March 2 when they travel to Molloy to take on the Lions at 3 p.m.

From the adrenaline running through your veins before feeling the sting of a relentless needle, to the reveal of a completed piece of art on your body, getting tattooed can be rewarding or devastating. When a beloved portrait of your Grandmother ends up looking like a cracked-out Gary Busey, it becomes your permanent night- mare. Gary will never go away. But does that mean our society has grown to accept him? I mean, the tattoo itself?
What if you are working in a corporation that forbids tattoos altogether? Do people even really care anymore whether you have a tattoo or not? After surveying 100 LIU Post undergraduates, students are more accepting of tattoos than ever, even though a majority of them said they were not sporting any body ink.
In fact, 92 percent of guys and gals said that they wouldn’t care if the person they were dating had a couple of tattoos. A small 6 percent of students said that it depended on the person, and an even smaller 2% percent said that they would not date anyone with a tattoo. However, times are changing and accord- ing to a recent national survey (Pew Research Center, July 2012), 36 percent of young adults ages 18-25 are sporting one or more pieces of body art, while 40 percent of adults ages 26-40 have tattoos as well. Tim Murphy, a junior philosophy major said, “I do believe tattoos are becoming more widely accepted in society with many popular icons sport- ing more and more tattoos. The stigma of tattoos being a sign of rebellion is fading and they’re becoming a form of art.”
Even in most corporate and retail workplaces, having visible tattoos is becoming less of an issue and more of a personal statement of individualization. GEICO, an insurance company, stated that their visible tattoo pol- icy is strict, yet each office of the company varies. In the Westbury Law Office, small wrist and ankle tattoos can be shown, while in the Woodbury Offices, no visible tattoos are allowed at all. Daniel Duffey, a junior english major said, “I thoroughly enjoys tattoos, particularly when juxtaposed with professional attire, like a neck tattoo with a suit and tie or a sleeve with a polo.” Other companies, including GameStop and Pac
Sun, say tattoos are allowed to be out in the open for all to see so long as appropriate dress code is followed. Gamestop’s dress code includes wearing either a polo or collared shirt while wearing khaki pants or jeans. Pac Sun’s is similar, except that you are persuaded to wear their skating and sports related shirts, hats, and pants.
After interviewing LIU undergrads, it would seem that most of our school population has adapted to the body ink trend that has been around since the late 40’s in the United States alone. Sadly, not everyone is so accepting of tattoos. “Tattoos are whatever. I personally don’t like them, nor do I think anyone else should get a tattoo, only because the permanence scares me. I’m not decisive enough to get one,” said Avi Lessman, a junior in the education department. Even Professor Ryden of the English department stated, “Tattoos freak me out.”
While a majority of the interviewed students felt that tattoos had no impact on their personal lives, it would seem that there are still parts of our generation (and previous generations) that feel as though tattoos are less than appealing. What it comes down to in the matter of getting inked, or dating someone who has a couple of pieces, is opinion. Judgments will always be made at the expense of others, and regardless, people will either go through the pain of getting Sponge Bob tattooed on their bum or they will laugh as their friends feel the misery of having needles rapidly digging and pull- ing at their fleshy bottom.

Whether or not you can deal with the permanency of a tattoo or be around an ever-growing community of average people with some colorful bodies, tattoos are here to stay. From the opinions of students, and the loosening tattoo policies in the work force, it can be said that people may see a divorce attorney with sleeves under his suit or see a grocery bagger with tattoos on his or her neck one day. Jane Addams once said, “Social advance depends as much upon the process through which it is secured as upon the result itself.” So to free one’s self from this arrogance, read some books, go to some shops, and know that some of our LIU undergrads will have some interesting sagging bodies and stories to tell their friends, family, kids, and grandchildren through the ink on their bodies.

On Saturday, February 17, Maroon 5’s lead singer Adam Levine, guitarist James Valentine, bassist Mickey Madden, drum- mer Matt Flynn and keyboardist PJ Morton performed for a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Excite- ment surged through the arena even before the doors opened at 7 p.m. As the audience waited in line, I overheard fans sharing sto- ries of how much they love the band and how the band has changed their lives.
One such story stemmed from a woman named Victoria Ruvolo who people may remember as the woman who was struck by a 20-pound frozen turkey in Lake Ronkonk- oma, Long Island on November 13, 2004. Part of the rehabilitation after her accident was music therapy, which included Maroon 5’s hit song, “She Will Be Loved.” Since then, she has had an emotional connection with the band’s music and has seen them in concert five times.
According to Maroon 5 guitarist James Valentine, the band’s Overexposed tour “is definitely going to be Maroon 5’s biggest tour.” That point was evident from the mo- ment the tour’s opening act, alternative rock band Neon Trees, took the stage with hits like “Everybody Talks” and “Animal” to name a few. The band even covered Human League’s well-known tune “Don’t You Want Me.” The killer set courtesy of Neon Trees definitely made up for the other opening act, Owl City, cancelling last minute due to illness.
Suddenly, the arena went dark and the distant sound of a phone ringing emanated from the speakers. The crowd roared as Ma- roon 5 hit the stage and kicked off the concert with hit song “Payphone.” The rest of the setlist included old favorites from the band’s first album, Songs About Jane, like “This Love” and “Harder to Breathe” mixed with songs from the band’s new album Overex- posed, like “Love Somebody” and “Daylight.”
Maroon 5 had the audience in the palm of its hand from the very first bars of “Pay- phone” to the last of “Moves Like Jagger.” The audience featured a wide variety of ages, proving that Maroon 5 appeals to many gen- erations and music genres. The 90-minute set contained a seamless blend of pop rock up-tempo numbers to heartfelt ballads. This is the eighth Maroon 5 concert I have been to and I honestly believe that this was the best one yet.
Adam Levine, who has skyrocketed to fame recently thanks to being a judge on NBC’s music competition show “The Voice,” reflected on the band’s rise to success by continually thanking the fans. “Ladies and gentlemen, it is unbelievable to be here at Madison Square Garden! We are a grateful bunch,” said Levine. “Every legendary act has played in this building. We are blown away and so thankful. We appreciate your love and for standing by us this entire time. Thank you so much in advance, we love you.”
The North American leg of the Over- exposed Tour continues now through April 26, 2013, ending in New Orleans. For more information, fans may visit www.ticketmaster. com or www.maroon5.com.

The shootings at Lone Star College’s North Harris Campus in Texas and Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut have sparked debate and conversation about gun rights in America. Additionally, the shootings have combined the terms gun own- ership and education in the same sentence.
According to the “Gun Ownership by State” infographic on the Washington Post website, about 18 percent of people in New York own guns. However, this number does not account for people who own guns illegally without permits.
On January 15, just days after the cam- pus shooting in Texas, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a new law that ex- panded the state’s existing assault weapons ban. It also limits the number of bullets al- lowed to be in the gun and beefs up rules that require reports of harmful behavior by the mentally ill.
The law focuses on reducing the permis- sible size of gun magazines from ten rounds to seven rounds. New York is the first state to change its gun laws in response to the recent shootings. The widened ban on assault weapons took effect immediately after the law was signed.
Despite its gun policy, which has been in effect since the campus opened in 1954, LIU Post has seen at least one instance of a gun on campus in recent years. On November 17, 2011, 72-year-old Criminal Justice adjunct professor, John Carney, accidentally shot himself in the groin and leg before his class.
Although Carney is a retired Fire Mar- shall and was licensed to carry a weapon, LIU Post enforced its strict no weapons policy on campus. Carney is no longer teaching at LIU Post. Ralph Baratto, associate director of Public Safety, said that as far as he knows there has never been an incident in regards to a student having a gun on campus, licensed or not.
Long Island University strictly prohibits the possession of firearms on its campuses, according to the Firearms Weapon Policy on LIU’s website. According to the policy, “Other than police officers or military personnel on active duty, no person, including a licensed individual, may possess firearms anywhere
on campus, whether in a building or on the grounds, without the prior written permission of the campus Provost and director of Public Safety. This prohibition extends to University-owned and University-controlled locations, including sites leased for educational purposes and housing obtained through the Offices of Residence Life. It is also extends to Campus Safety.”
Junior Sociology major Tommie Lewis said, “Guns are violent. The only people that should have them are government officials and members of the military.”
While America is one of the places where it is legal to have a registered gun, other countries prohibit the ownership of guns. International student, Bas Beuerwijx said, “It is illegal to have guns in Holland.” Adding, “If no one has a gun, then no one can shoot. Guns are used for protection right? If there are no guns, there is no reason to protect.”
Harmful weapons that are not permit- ted on the Long Island University campuses are pistols, revolvers, incendiary bombs, switchblade, daggers or bludgeons, as well as harmless instruments designed to look like weapons.

Have you ever felt so motivated in your life, that you would stop at nothing to get where you needed to be? If there’s a burning fire inside of you to achieve a goal you’ve set for yourself then you could relate to Donna Drake.
Elementary school was nearly four decades ago, but Drake will never forget the name of the girl who bullied her and made her feel like less of a person than anyone should ever feel. The memories Drake has from elementary school will forever be etched into her brain but not because she feels sorry for herself. They fueled her. Drake refused to stop until she felt significant enough, not for herself, but for the bullies that shaped her childhood. “What happened in second grade impacted me so severely that I thought to myself, ‘someday I’m going to be so famous that these kids are going to wish that they were my friends. Im going to be somebody someday,” Drake said. Now a wise mother and a successful business woman, she laughs at the distant memories of elementary school days.
Drake, a native of St. Louis, Missouri, is currently the host and producer of her own talk show, “Live It Up,” which adds to a long list of other successes she’s quite proud of. “Live It Up” is a weekly talk show bringing motivation and inspiration to its audience. It airs on Saturdays at 6:30 a.m. on CBS-10, WLNY.
It was the success of this current endeavor as well as other career tips that Drake offered to students who attended her lecture on February 21, as part of the “Food for Thought” lecture series hosted by the Media Arts deparment.
According to Professor Sandra Mardenfeld of the Journalism department, more students than usual stayed back after the lecture just to meet the speaker.
The beginning of Drake’s lecture was unconventional compared to previous “Food for Thought” speakers. She went around the small room of the basement of Humanities Hall and asked all of the students there to introduce themselves and give a quick detail about their lives. Students offered names, majors and whom they aspired to be one day. According to Rebecca Martelotti, sophomore Journalism major, it was a refreshing start to a lecture. To Drake, it was important to do this because she doesn’t speak with a certain plan of action in mind, she likes to mold her speech around the individuals in the room and make sure that they can all benefit from it.
Drake’s journey began in St. Louis, but she knew from a young age that she wasn’t going to die in Missouri. She knew that eventually her career would take her to either California or New York. “Who I am as a woman today is a direct result of who I thought I would be when I was little,” said Drake. According to her, all she kept doing was taking the next right step and doing what felt right. Before she knew it, in about 2002 she was exactly the woman who she thought she would become.
Late 2008 was the start of the next big chapter of Drake’s life. It was during that time that she became aware of a show that was being created about paying it forward. Drake was interested in becoming the host but the economy took a dip and her new job pursuit was crushed. On her drive home from the audition, Drake had an epiphany. “For goodness sake, I’ll do my own show,” Drake thought.
Following her epiphany, Drake dreamed of her new show. “I dreamt the entire thing in color,” Drake said.
In her vision she saw who her co-host would be, who the camera people were, the different segments of the show and other vivid details.
Drake promptly called all of the people who made an appearance in her dream and told them that she thinks they are supposed to use their talents to do this show and help people. They all agreed. “Sometimes you have to invest in yourself,” Drake told her audience. “Live It Up” was created on barter deals, credit and their own money in the beginning.
The dream happened in December of 2008 and the show went live on April 9, 2009. “It kind of just got a life of it’s own,” Drake said proudly, when talking about how quickly the show launched.
Drake also offered career tips for the students in the room. “Be a good writer, let people know they can rely on you,” she reminded the audience. Being resourceful and using humor were also qualities that were significant, according to Drake.
Junior Journalism major, David Otero, found Drake’s lecture excellent. “She has had a broad range of media-related experiences throughout her professional career and I found her journey very motivating, inspiring and interesting,” he said.
These days, Drake hosts and produces “Live It Up” weekly as well as works on various other projects, including volunteer work. She is currently working with Facebook to create an app that allows people to download and watch a version of “Live It Up.” When asked when she finds time to relax, Drake answered by saying that thankfully she enjoys her job so it doesn’t seem like work but her kids do help her relax. “I want to be used up. When I die I just to be all out,” she added jokingly.
“The message I got from her was to never let anyone hold you back, just because someone doesn’t believe in you, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t believe in yourself,” said Gabriella Ianiro, Journalism major.
The next “Food for Thought” lecture will be next Thursday, March 7, featuring Dr. Elizabeth Wollman, author of “Hard Times” and “The Theater Will Rock.” The goal of the lecture series is to bring in professionals who have inspiring stories to tell the students, according to Mardenfeld. “My goal is to expose our majors to a variety of careers in the Media Arts field,” she says.

It’s time to put away your hiking boots and put on your ski boots. Whether you’re a skier or a snowboarder, beginner or ad- vanced, winter will soon be over and the mountains are still open! So where are the best mountains to ski? Do you rent equip- ment on the mountain or at a local shop? Let’s take a look at what the New York area has to offer.
The Empire State, yes New York, is home to the most ski areas in all of the Unit- ed States. Can you believe it? The East Coast trumps the West Coast. New York moun- tains offer a variety of terrain for all skier types. Whether you’re beginner, intermedi- ate or an advanced on the mountain, there are multiple mountains to suit your needs. The mountains are as close as one hour and thirty minutes away.
Mount Peter located at 40 Ski Lane, Warwick, NY is just a one hour and thirty minute drive. You will find that this mountain has mostly beginner and intermediate slopes. For $28 you can rent skis, boots and poles and for $31 you can rent a snowboard and boots. A full day lift ticket cost $40. This is a great mountain for beginners since they offer a Special Mid-Week Learn to Ski Package from Monday-Friday, non-holidays; for first timers and beginners, this package includes a one hour group lesson, rentals and a beginner lift ticket. For an adult snowboarder the price is $50, and for an adult skier the price is $45.
“Living in New York City makes it easy for me to head upstate for a weekend of skiing,” said junior journalism major, Talia Charlton. Charlton is a beginner skier so she prefers to go to Mount Peter. “They offer great rentals for good prices and the trails are easy for me, they’re perfect for learning,” she added.
Hunter Mountain, located in the Catskills at 64 Klein Avenue, Hunter, NY is two hours and forty minutes away from campus. It has 1,600 foot vertical drop and 500 foot half pipe on 240 acres with the longest run being 2 miles long. Hunter Mountain has 55 trails, making it suitable for all skill levels. They offer ski rentals packages for $39 per day, which includes skis, boots and poles or snowboard and boots. Full day lift tickets are $70 per day. Hunter Mountain offers Ladies Day every Wednesday, for any mothers, daughters, aunts, girlfriends…ladies of all abilities. An all-area lift ticket, equipment rental and a group lesson are available for $58.
Windham Mountain is also located in the Catskills at 33 Clarence D Lane Road, Windham, NY. The drive to Windham will take about two hours and fifty minutes. Their highest vertical drop is 1,600 feet. They have a 400-foot half pipe, and 39 trails on 242 skiable acres. They offer ski rental packages for $40, which includes skis, boots, and poles or snowboard and boots. Windham offers college students a $10 discount off their daily lift ticket when a valid college ID is presented. This brings their lift ticket cost to $42 for a full day.
Sophomore social work major, Emma Weinstein, is an avid skier. She tries to get out to a mountain every weekend. “I enjoy skiing at local mountains since the drive isn’t too far and if I can only make it up for a day trip it’s perfect,” said Weinstein. She prefers to go to Windham, since “it’s very family oriented, so my family can ski together but, it also has challenging trails for me,” she adds.
These are three of New York’s moun- tains that are closest to campus, offer rentals and have nearby lodging. Should you rent your equipment at the mountain or at a local ski shop? It is usually recommended to rent at a local ski shop where you are able to rent equipment that is in better shape, avoid long lines and take the time to talk to professionals that are eager to help you.
There are two ski shops
that are located close to campus. Sundown Ski and Snowboard is located at 47 Northern Boule- vard Greenvale, NY. They offer daily ski rentals for $30, which includes skis, boots and poles. Daily snowboard and boot rentals are offered for $35. If you sign up for their emails you will receive a coupon for 10% off any one item, excluding ski and snowboard rentals.
“I recently stopped into Sun- down for a last minute purchase and was extremely disappointed with the service I received. I was being told false information just so that I would buy a pair of expensive ski boots,” said Wein- stein. She would recommend that students opt for other ski shops.
Another shop is located just 10 minutes from Sundown Ski and Snowboard called Ridgeline Ski and Board. It is located at 144 Plandome Road, Manhasset, NY. Ridgeline offers daily rental pack- ages for $25 that includes skis, boots, and poles or a snowboard and boots.
“We keep all of our rental equipment in very good condition. This season we ordered brand new, skis, boots and poles to add to our rentals,” said owner Frank Truglio. You will walk out of this shop with some sort of new rental equipment. Ridgeline also demos skis, which is a higher performance ski that someone would be interested in purchasing. This gives people the opportunity to try out skis before they make a purchase. In addi- tion to demoing skis, if you decide that you want to keep your rental equipment at the end of the season, you have the option to purchase it.
New York has so many different options for so many different people. There are great opportunities for people to learn how to ski without having to spend a ton of money or time traveling. There are options to just drive up for a day trip or spend the weekend. These mountains are open usually until late May to early April, it depends on whether or not they get snow. Happy skiing!

Let’s dance, dance like it is 2006. After a three and a half year hiatus, fans can finally say that Fall Out Boy is back and the band seems to be stronger than ever. Although rumors of the band’s return had been circulating, the pop-punk rockers denied any such reunion. However, on Super Bowl Sunday, the band announced that the break was over.
The Grammy-winning foursome is comprised of singer/gui- tarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, drummer Andy Hurley and guitarist Joe Trohman. The release of the band’s new single, “My Songs Know What You Did in The Dark (Light Em Up),” and accompanying music video, gained more than three million views in less than four days on YouTube. Fall Out Boy revealed the band was performing a show at the Subterranean in Chicago on its pre- miere night leaving crazy fans to fight for the few tickets that were offered at the small venue.
Fall Out Boy also announced a U.S. tour for the spring. Most of the shows sold out. I myself tried to score tickets for the New York show but with even with a presale code, the tickets were already sold out within a few hours. This month, Fall Out Boy is touring in Europe and Australia.
The band stated on its website, “When we were kids the only thing that got us through most days was music. It’s why we started Fall Out Boy in the first place. This isn’t a reunion because we never broke up. We needed to plug back in and make some music that matters to us! The future of Fall Out Boy starts now. Save rock and roll…”
The band’s hiatus started in 2009, 11 months after the release of the fourth album, “Folie A Deux,” which, according to many Fall Out Boy fans, was an overall flop. Weeks before this announce- ment, the Boys came out with a greatest hits album, “Believers Never Die,” in which the band released a new song entitled “From Now on We Are Enemies.”
Fans can pre-order the new album via the band’s website www.falloutboyrock.com. The album drops in April.

Some LIU Post students are looking for on campus jobs. However, many report that they have never heard of JobNet, Post’s online job bank for both on and off campus jobs.
Career Services, the department designed to help students and alumni find jobs, internships and develop resumes, makes sure that the employers’ postings are legitimate and that they will serve as a productive learning environment for students before entering the listings into the system.
Some students, according to Jason Cascone, the director of career development, do not use JobNet because they do not know about all of the features it includes. Students can search for employers on the website that are located nearby, out of state and globally. They can also upload their resume to the site to make sending it to employers a quicker process.
“I never even heard of it [JobNet] before,” said Devan Farrell, junior Public Relations major, who works in the Winnick House for the Public Relations Office.
Farrell found her job by speaking with Professor Abby Dress of the Public Relations department. She knew that in the summer she wanted to declare her major as Public Relations, so she believed that talking to Dress was the best way to go. Dress put her in contact with Rita Langdon, associate provost and public relations director, and after being interviewed, Farrell got the job.
“I didn’t want to work in a restaurant or a tanning salon, I wanted to do something for my major,” said Farrell.
Similarly, Patrick McCabe, freshman Film and Animation major, is currently applying for an on-campus job that he found without JobNet. He is applying to be a Resident Assistant (RA).
“My sister was an RA and she had a blast, plus it takes a load of money off paying for school,” said McCabe.
Although some students are finding jobs through networking on campus, JobNet is available to those who may not have as many connections.
“JobNet is LIU Post’s job bank so anything we get from internships, part time jobs to full time jobs will go into that system. Any type of job that a student is looking for, when we find out about it, it will go into that JobNet system,” Cascone added.
Andres Molnar, senior Political Science major, signed up for JobNet after his friends told him about it. He thought he would try out the website because he is looking for a job for after he graduates this May. “During this time it’s hard to find a job, so you have to use all of your resources,” said Molnar.
He has been searching for jobs prior to joining JobNet and had some interviews. He said that he is hoping that there will be many employers on the website that he will be interested in to increase his chance of finding a job.
No matter what type of job one is looking for, according to Cascone, the amount of time and energy put into the job search will be a large factor in whether or not the individual is successful in finding a job.
For more information about JobNet, Career Services or to make an appointment with a councilor, students may call (516) 299-2251, visit www.liu.edu/post/jobnet or go to Career Services on the second floor of Kumble Hall Monday through Thursday between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. or Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
